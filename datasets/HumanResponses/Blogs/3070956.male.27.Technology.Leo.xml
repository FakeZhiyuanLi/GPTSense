       The Village, Ariane, and the Wicked Monk   Yesterday morning I woke up early - like 6:15 AM (that's really early for me), because I couldn't sleep.  I had a nice relaxing morninig with my family.  I took my time, worked a little, read a little, watched TV with my father and my sister, toured my mom's garden's with her (they're really great this year), and proceeded to NY to visit with my client.       Jewel in front of my parent's house  urlLink         urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      My mommy  urlLink        It's been absolutely beautiful out this week and the traffic was less compared to usual all around.  My mom and I thought about going to the beach Wednesday morning since she's not busy, but I've got plans in Pittsburgh... on the way into NJ had a really great conversation with the real-estate girl for over an hour.  She's like me in that she quit a good job to take a risk on something else within the last year.  So we have a date, hehe.  Anyway, everyone has been working hard so were able to quickly pop out changes for the software that were suggested by my client on Friday already.  I implemented the changes there on Monday and at some point spoke with my best friend Warren who suggested we get some drinks in the Village.   I picked him up near his work downtown and we drove to Greenwich Village.  We ended up at this place called  urlLink 1849 . It was  awesome .  They had live music by this guy who was singing popular songs by people like Neil Diamond, Peter Gabriel, Elton John and other stuff one can sing along to, hehe.  Warren and I had a great time talking to each other, the bartender - Jessica Jacobs, and this guy we met there named Leonardo Mayorga.  We had such a fun time at this place.  We ate wings and drank a lot of beer, but on Tuesday nights they have a $2.50 special on all beer - what a deal in NYC.       Me, Warren and Leo   urlLink    Our bartender, Jessica Jacobs  urlLink      urlLink    Me and the performer at 1814... picture really suks tho'      Now, on my way to pick up Warren, I somehow got the idea to call Ariane Motylewski.  Now, when I was a teenager, my parents and started taking us camping in Maine for summer vacation and we always had a great time.  My favorite vacation ever was when I met Ariane.  I swear she was like the first girl I ever fell for hahaha.  We spent a lot of time together on that vacation, and she was from Brooklyn, NY and I was from NJ.  I remember that she also came to this big 16th birthday party that we threw at Warren's house.  That was the last time I saw her - my 16th birthday - almost 12 years ago!  But I call her once in a while... the last time was like 6 years ago just to see how she is and what she's up to.  I remembered her last name and called directory assistance.  They gave me a number and I called and left a message not sure if it was even her voice on the machine at the other end. Well, she called me back while I was with Warren, we spoke a little and caught up with each other a bit... and later that nigth diring a phone call I asked her if we could meet since I had to drop Warren off ot his apartment and she lived nearby.  She agreed and we meet for the first time in 12 years - at 3:30 AM on a Tuesday morning. WOW.  I still can't get over how neat that is for me when I think about it.  Ariane Motylewski, 15 years old.   Lake Pemaquid, Maine (1991).  urlLink     Friends I made in 1991 at Lake Pemaquid on vacation. I'm the one (15 years old) all the way to the left.  Ariane is sitting next to me.  urlLink     We had a nice time talking - she took me to this bar near her house called the  urlLink Wicked Monk . We went to the door and it was locked, but if you know me I'm pretty persistent and knocked because I saw that there were still a few people left at the bar.   urlLink Cozmic  comes to the door and I ask im if he could please let in two alcoholics who haven't seen each other in 12 years.  He thought for a few  seconds and said we could stay for one drink and then we had to get right out.  He later said that he looked up someone once after such a long time and that it was neat.  He also said there must be something special in the air because other people came to the door before us and he didn't let them in, but he felt compelled to let us in.  He was a nice guy.  The bar was also very cool.  I'd like to check it out sometime when there are more people.  We had nice conversation and a but not a very long one there since the place was closing.  We just sat in my car in front of Ariane's place and talked for about an hour... it was a nice time and the end to a  VERY  full day.  Needless to say, I was too weary to drive very far and ended up crashing at Warren's house and got little sleep. Yet, when I woke up I was suprised to find how much I liked the neighborhood where Warren's new apartment is (he  JUST  moved like.. two weeks ago).  There were little shops and stores and a Mall was in walking distance.  Very cool.  I could totally live in a place like that.    Warren in looking to get into real estate and he's asked me to help him since I have a couple of properties already and he thinks I know something.  So on my way out I saw a real estate office and went over and spoke with the President/Broker about the possibility of getting Warren started. It was a fun conversation.  I think her name was Betty.  Hopefully, Warren will go over to see her before she forgets all about our conversation.  I went to visit my client and spent the rest of my day there.  Leo said he might call me to go to Jones beach, but I didn't hear from him until about 5:45 when I was already on my way back to NJ... but I was glad he called becuase I'd like to keep in touch - we all had fun hanging out the night before.  I was hoping to visit my uncle Tony at the resturaunt he's working on getting open soon.  I haven;t seen him in a while, but we couldn't catch each other afterall this afternoon. Oh well.  Instead I went and bought my digital camera. I was considering purchasing the Minolta Dimage Xt, but checked the Minolta website just yesterday to find that there's an updated model - the  urlLink Dimage Xg  When I was buying it I saw even smaller (though more expensive cameras - notably by Casio and Panasonic - neat).  I charged my phone up tonight - so watch out!  I'm about to start taking pictures all the time now. I even bought a pouch for it so I can keep it on my belt, hehe.  I'm excited!

      Back to New Jersey (again)  ...and back to New York to visit with my beta users.  Every time I come home I try to visit them since I am close by anyway.  I came home to go to the graduation/birthday party for the daughter of close friends of the family.  I'll post pictures when I get them.  I had a fun time with my family and sat with my friend Colin Wiseman who is a high-level technology manager at Citibank, and Mike who used to be at Citibank and now is a consultant (mainly for ADP right now).  We had some great conversation about driving fast, technology, and possibility. I also danced with Krissa and her family & had fun catching up with some people I haven't seen in a while.  My little sister Kristen was late to the party and she got all dressed up and looked great.  So, we had to go out somehwere.  But on a Sunday night at 10:30 PM?? We went to New Brunswick.  The first lounge we looked at was kind of beat... we just looked inside and left. We ended up at the Harvest Moon Brewery in New Brunswick.  The last time I was there was with Sarah Bemis, my sisters, my cousin Melissa Gomes, and her boyfriend Alex Santos about 9 months ago...  Me, my cousin Melissa, and my sister Kristen  urlLink     Me and Sarah at the Harvest Moon  urlLink       * * * * *    My family and I are going to Portugal as part of celebrating my parents' 30th wedding aniversary.  My mother was born there and has always spoken about going back with us to see family and where she was a child.  I had planned to go with my sister Marisa about 2 years ago for a roots trip and even had tickets, but our plans fell through becuase of problems with work.  Hopefully, Marisa will be able to make it this time, but I doubt it since she's alredy planned a lot of vacation for the year - her and like 25 friends are going to Las Vegan in August.  Looks like we'll be going to Portugal in late September or early October (thanks to my abundant frequent flyer miles).  Kristen won't be able to since she'll be in school. Since she won't be able to go in September, of all the people in the world she asked me to go on vacation with her in August.  I really want to take her up on it.  It looks like we'll be going to Trinidad.  My best friend and closest family friends are Trinidadian.  My mother told me last night that my she and my father are planning a trip there in August with Phil & Donna Allen - perfect!  She says she found tickets for only $299.  So we'll have my parents and close friends with us, and we'll have a place to stay for free - what an opportunity!  I'm excited.  Plus, my birthday is August 18th so it's possible I'll be able to celebrate my birthday there with my family. whohoo!

       Songs I like right now - Maroon 5 lyrics:  "This Love"    I was so high I did not recognize The fire burning in her eyes The chaos that controlled my mind Whispered goodbye and she got on a plane Never to return again But always in my heart  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I tried my best to feed her appetite Keep her coming every night So hard to keep her satisfied Kept playing love like it was just a game Pretending to feel the same Then turn around and leave again  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  I'll fix these broken things Repair your broken wings And make sure everything's alright My pressure on your hips Sinking my fingertips Into every inch of you Cause I know that's what you want me to do  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And my heart is breaking in front of me She said Goodbye too many times before  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore...

       Jackhammered Greetings   Yep... that's how I woke up today... to the sound of Jackhammers. ouch!  Nice day out... spent some time outside... talking to the jackhammer guys, hehe.  Did laundry, paid bills, yada yada yada.  Got some work done, too. Just a pretty laid-back (yet productive) day. I read a lot, too. I was going to hit the road to NJ today, but I decided it would be better to relax a bit.  Spent some time with my friend on the phone.  She's moving to Hawii on a whim because she's totally into this guy and she's getting scared so we talked a bit - think she just needed to talk about it.  Sweet article I found today:  urlLink MSNBC - Genetic mutation turns tot into superboy   Spoke with my best friend from growing up, Warren, today for a while.  I noticed that most of my friends have certain things in common: they are philosophical, easily inspirable, and generally open to and accepting of people.  Warren and I usually have pretty cool conversations about well... whatever is going on and/or comes to mind.  I was speaking with him today about this context that I'm stuck in that goes something like: "You never know what you're gonna get, so choose to commit to whatever feels right and inspires you."  But the more I think about this, the more bothered I am.  It's irresponsible... just like when people say "everything happens for a reason" ...what bunk - that just takes all responsibility off of them for making things happen in their life and making it ok when they mess up and things go wrong.  So where I am at I guess, is that I commit to people and things more easily now than ever, which has been a huge jump forward. On the other hand, the quality of those people and things may not be the best I am capable of.  My choices right now are possibly... very arbitrary and out of my control with this context.  However, It's what makes sense to me right now and I'm worried... I think when this context evolves to the next level in my mind - to where I just can't see yet, that I'll reach the next big leap forward in my progress with every area of my life. Just need to find something that makes more sense to me... uugh.  My friend told me about this stream and I ended up liking it a lot:   urlLink ClubFM Internet Dance Radio, Trance Radio, House Radio, Tampa Radio, Chicago Dance Radio, Las Vegas   Eesh... getting tired early tonight, but somehow I wish I were somewhere out - dancing with good friends.

       After Hours??? Why me??   Another crazy night ensued.  Left for DejaVu around 12 AM.  Met Alan and then ... other friends were there.  I remember complimenting some girl because she had a great body and was wearing this wife-beater with no bra.  That kind of boldness is very sexy to me.  Though... I didn't ask her for her number or anything.  I don't know why; we had a nice conversation... anyway... I also danced a lot tonight.... first at DejaVu... there were these two sisters.  One was 30 but she looked 23 (I swear) and her sister had just turned 21.  When I introduced myself to the (hot) older sister, she challenged me to 'get down' with her sister... which I proceeded to do gladly - any excuse to dance,  really.  After that, I guess she liked what she saw; we also had some fun talking and dancing together... and of course she had a boyfriend whom she said was 'hot' and that's why she was dating him. I guess it fits well :)  I invited them to my party, too - of course.  Then I somehow got convinced to go to after-hours & I really had fun dancing there.  It's mostly house music, which is pretty hard to find in Pittsburgh.  I enjoyed dancing to it.  There was some guy named Erwin there who was passing through.  We spoke for a while and I found out that he was in the King and I, touring.  He was a great dancer.  I also met with the owner regarding a conversation I had with one of the top detectives at Pittsburgh Vice. During the conversation it sounded like the detective had it out for this guy so I just shared that with him. He appreciated it and I'm sure he'll rememeber me now... which is good because this place is pretty hard to get into unless you know the owner or the bouncer pretty well.  I made some other friends while I was there, too... It was funny because the 'prick' I spoke about last time bumped into us on the way to DejaVu and so he came to after-hourse with us, too.  He continued to confirm to everyone how much he was a prick hahaha.  Oh well. We all had fun.  How am I to be productive tomorrow???  I'm definitely sleeping in again.  I might try to go to NJ Sunday morning instead of tomorrow so the I can focus on getting my house and laundry in order and get some work done, too.

       Ick! Cloudy Day...   That is, my head was in the clouds today.  Last night took it's toll on me and I was hardly productive today.  But a good customer and friend of mine called me today - that was overdue.  His company has agreed to fund my robotic automation projects for the construction materials industry  if  the numbers look right (which I am still working on).    Other friends called me to invite me last minute to a bachelors party - just not feeling it tonight  -shrug-   I found out my only living grandmother is in the hospital with pneumonia.  I still have to call her. Last time I saw her she was in bed and was taking a nap.  I was saying goodbye to her as I left for PA.  I thought she felt feverish and mentioned it, but she said she was just tired. Guess there was reason for concern after all.  Sad and worried about all that. hrmmm.  My sister, Marisa,  confirmed she'll be driving over here to the 'burgh to come to my party - yea!  My friend Alain called me back.  He owns a few resturaunts in Pittsburgh and New York.  Looks like he'll be coming, too!  One of my interns is driving all the way over from Ohio.  All good news.  Oh! This is funny... went to trim the hair over my ears a little yesterday and slipped.  Yep... little bald spot right above my left ear so I had to wear my glasses last night (but they're cool).  Anyway... went to get an emergency cut today and you can't tell it had happened looks nice, though my regular hair stylist was off today so I had to get it done by someone else.  He did a good job. Oh well. Sorry, Marlene.  My friend Kate Deeley got me a google gMail account. So that was also pretty cool.    What else... helped my neighbor with her computer a little bit and also worked a bit.  I did not get a lot done with the softwate today, unfortunately. booo!  Oh yeah... I finally put together my new weight set!  Now I realize I just need heavier weights.  I'm really motivated and psyched because I build quickly.  And then I saw  urlLink this guy 's site... he documents his whole weight loss and muscle building history - very interesting.  I was suprised by how quick it happens.  Definitely going to be much bigger in 2-3 months, hehe. I lost 35 pounds over the last year and can't stand to lose much more weight.  Now it's time to build, baby!  Now I'm heating up some dinner and getting ready to meet friends out at ... DejaVu, of course. Where else, lately.  Think I still need to drink some more water.  Gonna be late gotto go...

       Finally... Some Goals Accomplished   Yesterday was a good day.   After I got back to Pittsburgh the night before last, I did some work and met my good friend Alan out at  urlLink Deja Vu .  We hang out there all the time - he has a VIP membership there and you get to know the crowd after a while.  After all is said and done, Alan crashes at my place for the first time.  My father gave me a bottle of cheap red wine on the way out of their house that day so we ended the night with that and some conversation.   We woke up and Alan left - he's waiting to hear on a job in D.C. and received a phone call about an interview for a job starting this Monday so he rushed out (he ended up not liking the position so is still on the lookout). Then, some of the things that I've been working on finally came to a head and got done...  (1) The latest version of my software was released to my users. It was a hectic release, but we keep getting better at this.  I wanted this release to go out Sunday night and it ended up going out Thursday... not too shabby - it's actually a record so far... thanks to my interns.  (2) A few weeks ago, my friend Jon was going to meet my real-estate agent, Jeanne to look at some houses.  On his way he totaled  his  Acura Integra (I totaled the same car when I had it and believe it is dangerous on sharp curves and wet conditions).  He drives like me so he was going 100 mph on route 376 out here... he came around the bend to find traffic backed-up because of an accident and ran into the road barrier at 80 mph trying to avoid rear-ending other cars!  He had some cuts and bruises, but because he works out regularly he was in good general condition. Anyway, I digress... to take his mind off of it, it was a nice day and there was a house in my neighborhood that I had been eye-ing and they were having an open house that day... so we went in and got a tour of the place by the agent who was... well... hot. She had style and a good energy about her, too. Well, she followed up with both  me and Jon later that week, and then she sent me a thank you note and some listings in the mail - really on top of things.  So... I called her yesterday and asked her out since I'd like to learn more about her & we'll be hanging out next week sometime - very cool.  (3) I got the e-vite out for the party we're having on July 10th after confirming with the booze distributor about the promotion they're bringing in and making up the initial guest list.  It was a lot of work actually.  Now we just have to figure out how we're going to get the DJ equipment and an interlocking dance-floor delivered to the bar that day.  Later, I met Alan out at the  urlLink Walnut Grill in Shadyside .  We had a few drinks there. I especially like the way they make me my 151 and Coke there - it's always just right!  Anyway one of Alan's friends came out to meet us and we spoke with some college girls for a little bit and then after some talk amongst us computer programming geeks Alan's friend split and the two of us went out to the strip district to Deja Vu.  But it was dead for some reason so we started looking around.   We ended up going to Chemistry which had a pretty good DJ spinning house music.  I ended up dancing - because I love to dance and because there was a girl I wanted to meet on the dancefloor (there weren't that many people there).  I did up meeting her and getting her number. Another college student (I've been digging the younger women lately for some reason). So hopefully we'll can hang out too, she seemed like a lot of fun.  Alan and I went to Primanti's and I got my usual - a capricola and cheese. I ate it on the way to after-hours at H2O... I'm eating and we're waiting to get into this place and there is this guy who is pretty much always a prick when I see him around.  Alan starts talking to him. Now, I always thought that this guy was just a prick to me.  But he's not... he's just a prick - period.  So I was in this very impulsive wierd mood last night and I bring up to this guy and Alan that he's always a prick every time I see him, and that I'm OK with it... but just acknowledged it about this guy in this conversation we were having with him. He completely agreed with me and continued to be a prick but we were ok with it now and actually ended up talking to the guy and making friends with him.  Which is cool since he also has a software company (as does Alan as well). So we all had shit in common.  We left before closing at some point.  I don't think I drank at all... just danced my buzz off with some stripper from Bare Elegance (she was off duty, hehe) It was fun. Then went home and crashed and here I am... ready to have some breakfast and get back to work.  Damn I can't wait to get my digital camera!

       My First Broadway Show   Wow! Stayed in NYC last night.  Stayed in a nice hotel room in times square and saw my first Broadway show:   urlLink Bombay Dreams . I was thoroughly impressed and can't wait to see another.  If you ever go to New York and want to see a show in times square you can get last minute tickets right in the middle of times square at this little red and white booth.  We almost went to see Rent, but the girl I was with already saw it so we asked what was the most popular out of what was left and so it was... Bombay Dreams!  The costumes were amazing the dancing was amazing, and the story line was interesting to me.   I decided I need a digital camera.  I am always doing things and don't have pictures when it would really be cool. So... I did my homework and the camera I want is the  urlLink Minolta Dimage XT . I especially like it because I can take it anywhere with me (it's about the size of a wallet) and it has a lot of features for a pretty low-cost camera (  After the show we went to a nice Mexican restaurant on 48th and 8th street.  FYI, there is a great place to park if you want to hang out in New York for the night right next door to this place, but only if you are staying until midnight.  If you want to stay overnight, there are other garages on 48th that are fairly priced at about $25/day. The hotel was OK for the location - we stayed at the Best Western President and parked right across the street at the Ritz.   The next day I ran some errands and we ate Lunch at the Olive Garden, which is also right in the middle of Times Square.  I reccomend it if you're on a budget - you know what to expect with the food there and you get a pretty good deal; I myself always go for the unlimited soup and salad special, hehe.  Unfortunately, getting back was not so cool, though. We had to wait forever for my car, and then I wasn't;t sure how to get to the Lincoln tunnel.  I bought a map and then it took a lot longer to get out of the city then expected - oh well.    I ran to my place in NJ, picked up my stuff from my parents place (I also had to quickly set up wireless networking at my parent's place), and then promptly left... though we got to visit with all my family, pretty much for  avery short while.    The drive back was ok... Oh!  What an adventure my life is... If you know me, you will know that I drive like a maniac. I can get from Pittsburgh to Piscataway, NJ or NYC in 5 Hours.  I can get back in 4.5 hours (somehow the route coming back is was shorter).  I make this drive constantly to see my family, so I'm used to it and know the route well: PA Turnpike -> Route 81 North -> Route 78 East -> Route 22 E (Shortcut don;t take it during rush-hour) -> back on Route 78 East -> Route 287 South (or keep going for NYC) I sometimes get it up to > 110 mph. People got freaked out by my driving called the cops on me on the way out there... and I was scared since any mistakes until between now and November will cost me dearly since in November my insurance goes way down (it's the three year anniversary of me totaling my old 1996 Acura Integra (man, I used to love that car!). In the end I only got a ticket for not having my car inspected since that is all they could prove.     oh well. The fucked-up thing is that my car was inspected - they just couldn't put the sticker on since the registration stickers weren't on the license plate (in PA we have little registration stickers that go on the corner of out license plates instead of on the windshield).  Yeah... so that could cost me up to $105 (grrrr).  Oh well.

       Darn   Still at my client's site at this point.  I was hoping to release a new version of my software this past weekend, but the changes we made are having problems working together after performing a merge. We're using  urlLink Subversion  for source and version control. It's been working great considering that everyone is working remotely on this project... once we finally got it installed which was quite tricky.  Anyway this release has been tricky - hopefully we can get it out by tomorrow night.  Everyone's working hard, so I'm hopeful.  Toward the end of the day I realized that I have to be at a party in the area next Sunday.  I would have decided to just stay in NJ for the week, but this time I brought a girl I'm dating out with me so she could visit friends in NY.  I don't think she's going to want to stay until Monday with me, so I guess I'll have to go out to Pittsburgh and come back this weekend again  -  shrug  - So looks like lots of driving for me this week (again). Oh well.  One of my friends is organizing an all night golfing outing at a local golf club. That sounds exciting...  My friends and I area also throwing a party on July 10.  We rented out a nice bar and have Malibou Run coming it to perform a promotion for their new Pineapple and Mango flavors.  We had our first one in March of last year.. urlLink  Here are some of the pictures . They're providing everything for a tiki theme and some free booze.  I'm psyched!  ...so yeah, there's a lot to look forward to right now, too.

       Long Day ... Short Morn' (so far)   Yeah... so it's 3:33 AM and I'm finally getting tired - yes!  Hanging here in my hotel room and I actually got the nicest room yet.  Since I can't use my modem unless I want to get raped on the phone bill here, I connect at a measly 19.2 kbs using a special USB connection to my cell phone (free after 9 PM, hehe)... but it somehow does the trick for me.  I'm excited because I just received the pictures from my sister's 25th birthday night.  Feast on the pictures:     These are my little sisters. They rock.   Kristen  is on the left and  Marisa  (the b-day girl) is on the right.      Marisa  and  Kristen  with my cousins  Jessica  (all the way to the left) and  Melissa  (all the way to the right)     Me with  my sisters      Me with my my best friend  Warren  (we've been close friends since we were 5) and Melissa's boyfriend  Alex ...     ...and let's not forget this  beautiful sexy girl  I had fun dancing with (in the light blue below), hehe... too bad she had a boyfriend :(  man, she was cool.        The most interesting thing was that we almost got into a fist-fight with the bouncers of the place due to them just being dick-heads to our whole group. They were on a power trip... or maybe they were all high - who knows. I don't think any of us will ever be going back to that place again. It was a really fun night that just didn't end well.  Actually, the drive home was really fun!  Anyways, I want to say more, but I am so tired and this is taking long because I'm still learning the capabilities of this blogging tool.

      Starbuck's Wi-Fi  Ahhh... almosty forgot about this site.  I started looking at different sites to host my blog and finally decided on this one. Very cool.    Now... I'm traveling and I'm at Starbucks so I can use the Internet to work since my hotel room wants to charge 60 cents/min for local calls - uugh. They keep playing "Big Time" by Peter Gabriel, but I don't mind since I feel like it's almost a theme song for me, hehe.  I just wish they would let one of the songs finish playing - grrr.  So annoying.  I quit my full-time job (where I was well paid) last year to make practically nothing for the past year and a half and it looks like it's finally starting to pay off.  I have a  number of very cool and talented people working for me to build my first software product.  We hope to have a fully functional version done by the end of the summer. Prospective customers are excited about the possibilities and so are we.

      My family is constantly getting together and having parties. I love it! This one is for the June and July birthdays - which includes my Uncle Frank, Aunt Donna, my sister Marisa, and my cousin Melissa. I had to cut out of there after grabbing some food and visiting - very early (wasn't kicking yet before I left) becuase I had a super-huge software release of my software due out to my client that wasn;t anywhere near ready to go out. Ugh. I'm actually still working on it&nbsp; (it's actually Wednesday already and the party was last Sunday). Too bad since it was such a nice day!&nbsp; The pictures weren't that great since I left early and was preoccupied about getting out of there... but I got a few...&nbsp;  These pictures are of my cousin Melissa (on the left) and my sister Kristen the one that invited my to go on vacation with her.&nbsp; Trinidad - I can't wait! The second picture was taken while I was playing pool with Melissa and her boyfriend, Alex.&nbsp; He's such a good guy;&nbsp; I'm so happy with for Melissa.   urlLink    urlLink     Younger cousins - the first one below is me and Ben, my uncle Frank's son.&nbsp; His younger brother Frank, Jr. is the youngest in my generation (and I'm the oldest, hehe).&nbsp; I tried getting Franky Jr. in a pic but he was just waking up from a nap and kinda cranky still - though he is almost always such a happy 2-year old! Oh well.&nbsp; The other pic is of me and Sabrina.&nbsp; She's growing up so beautiful... she's my Uncle Tony's daughter.&nbsp; We were at his house this time.&nbsp; Melissa is also his daughter.&nbsp; All my cousins are beautiful - I'm proud pf them in many ways!    urlLink    urlLink      My dad hanging out  urlLink     The food was great, as usual. We have lots of good cooks in my family, including my mom and Uncle Tony, who is about to open a nice resturant in Newark, NJ.&nbsp; You may see some pictures of that soon, too!&nbsp; He's having a special opening night for just the family on August 6th - right before Trinidad!&nbsp; ...I love my life.

      A reliable source once told me that the word  posh  originated from the phrase 'Port Out, Starboard Home'.  urlLink She was probably wrong .   Anyway, Ariane's boss had a very posh wedding. It was among the most impressive receptions I have experienced - wow! I guess that possible when you marry two older doctors.    Ariane and her boss, the groom.   urlLink     ... I did end up getting to Ariane's place in plenty of time to get ready and hang out for a bit. After 12 years her mother remembered speaking with my parents about Lebanese food and had picked some up from a local restaurant - it was great. It was a good thing since I was starving after not having eaten all day!   I also found out that her parents have fun as members of a large historical society named  urlLink The Society for Creative Anachronism . The organization learns creatively about the Middle Ages. Ariane's parents  urlLink prepare for war  in Slippery Rock, PA together each year by making costumes, equipment, and a large tent - all in accordance with what one would see in the Middle Ages. The pictures below include one with me and her mom, and another of her father working on their  urlLink tent .     urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink     The event is called the  urlLink Pennsic War , and according to information I found on one of the previous links here's a short list of the major event highlights:     A wide variety of heavy armor combat in various melee scenarios with lots of participants (we're talking really big battles here, where binoculars are highly recommended!).  Archery competitions in a wide variety of shoots.  Arts and sciences competitions and displays.  Demonstration sports (games, ballistic weapons, blackpowder, weapon styles, etc.).  Huge (and lengthy) kingdom courts.  An enormous masked ball.  Lots of merchants (Ancient SCA Proverb: If you can't buy it at Pennsic, it can't be bought!).   Tons of classes (you wouldn't believe how many!).  Parties, parties and more parties. Did I mention parties?   ...wow. Sounds pretty cool! I might have to just go and see since it is so close, hehe.     * * * * *   After we were all ready (and I was all fed), we picked up her friends Dina and Steve and went to the St. Regis hotel. The pictures below are of Dina and Steven and then Dina and Ariane.     urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink     This was one crazy expensive wedding; when we first got there - valet parking was included and the door. We couldn't go up to the wedding until it was time so, we all went to the lounge, of course. Well! Guess how much drink were?? I bought two drinks - a Captain & Coke for myself (they were out of 151), and a Bombay and Tonic for Ariane... before tip the drinks cost $34 and change!!  Ugh .    The most expensive drinks ever!   urlLink     The generosity of the bride and groom more than made up for my expense at the bar, however; when we finally went to the reception we received amazing service, an open bar with champagne and practically any drink I could want, huge shrimp with tasty sauces, rack of lamb, and other delicious starters. I was surprised at the setup there that I initially expected that there wasn't going to be a sit-down dinner! Oh, these are just the appetizers I was told later... wow.   We sat down at tables shadowed by towering floral arrangements and glasses of white wine. We were served salads with huge chunks of lobster. We were given a choice of either fillet mignon or Chilean sea bass as the main course. The desert was a hard thin chocolate candy cup filled with berries and topped with delicious sorbet in the shape of miniature pears and other fruit... dinner was great.     urlLink    urlLink     And the cake... again - wow.&nbsp; It was well, a wedding cake. Both, it was exceptionally decorated with an ornate bouquet of cream flowers! Ariane hear that is had cost in excess of $5000.       urlLink      urlLink        The band was great & performed of jazz and popular songs. Ariane and I had fun dancing together. I got to be a sweaty mess as usual, heh.    Everyone dancing   urlLink     Another interesting occurrence - I hit it off really well with this guy at the next table to find out from Ariane later in the night that he's the NYC commissioner! hahaha. He gave me his card at the end and told me to keep in touch. We had fun speaking.   &nbsp;  Me and  urlLink Commissioner Joseph Bruno    urlLink     Everyone received favors after the wedding reception, though I didn't take one. It was Waterford Crystal. Nice. After all, I was thoroughly impressed and had a great time.   People I was spoke to were inspired about how Ariane and I were hanging out after not seeing each other for 12 years. You never know... you know? I guess I made an impression in other ways as well; Ariane later e-mailed me:    So I was at work today and the phone keeps ringing. Five of those calls were from Dina, Ida, Paul, Maria (Ciro's wife/ Ida's cousin who never calls just to talk to me) and Dr. B (from his honeymoon in the Caymans) who all called just to tell me how charming, personable, handsome and in general what a great person you are. Everyone at the table adored you and really enjoyed your company. ...how nice - what a compliment! I'm so touched!     * * * * *   We left the wedding after midnight to meet Warren and other friends of mine. They were celebrating the birthday of Warren's cousin and my friend, Joanne.    Me and Joanne   urlLink     Ariane and I each had a drink and danced with everyone and partied. It was good times, but I got tired after an hour or so because I got up so early in the morning.   Warren has a girlfriend, now. Which is crazy because it's been such a long time. She's pretty cool, and I can't wait to get to know her better - I've only seen her in crowded loud crazy places so far, hehe.     urlLink     In the picture above is of Warren's girlfriend, Daryll - Warren's younger brother who I hadn't seen in over 6 years, some girl I didn't know - think her name was Stacy, and then Ariane on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;   On the way back to Ariane's place I got a flat in the worst of places. Didn;t really need that.  sigh .  Had to change the tire in my nice clothes and I was tired. Ugh.  The next morning, Ariane went to a diner by her house and enjoyed the pictures together  It was a good, full day... after 12 years, hahaha.  -Ryan Riehle

      OK...  so I am almost ready to head out to NYC where I will pick up  urlLink Ariane  and escort her to her boss' wedding downtown.  I might be in the area for a long time if I don't come back to Pittsburgh before my trip to Trinidad.  I'm still packing.  I have a software release planned for Sunday night that still has a lot to go before it's ready. It's really important it gets out. Ugh - I'l be driving and then at this wedding, and then meeting up with Warren and friends, and then tomorrow is a big family party... must... find... a way.  I learned a new cool word yesterday afternoon ->  in·sou·ci·ance  : lighthearted unconcern : NONCHALANCE  ...I like it!  I went out last night when I didn't even feel like it and spent $30.  Not too happy about that. I should have just stayed in and prepared to leave.  But, I would have felt like I was missing out on something because it was such a nice night out.  shrug . But it was an especially bad idea considering how much fun I had Thursday night...  I was just spent and tired.  hrmmm... I probably don;t have time to hit the library and pick up a book on tape... though it would be nice if I could; I'm in the mood for that today.

        urlLink      Sara has been a great friend and we've supported each other through the last year with relationships and work.  She's moving to Savannah, GA with her boyfriend Aaron and I'll miss knowing that she's right here near me in Pittsburgh, PA.  To say goodbye, we met in Shadyside and had drinks and dinner at a place called  Bites and Brews  on Ellsworth Avenue.  It was pretty cool - they have no menu items really - you put together your sandwich with any combination of their ingredients that you ask for.  They have a nice selections of beers and the prices were great.  -Ryan Riehle

      Yeah... so I found out last minute that DejaVu was having a Toga Party to raise money for cystic fibrosis.&nbsp; Chris was running a promotion there for some good Tequila.&nbsp; LOTS of Tequila ...LOTS. Man, we had SOOO much fun - I was totally out of control.&nbsp; But, not a regret - it was a great time.&nbsp; No hangover today.&nbsp; Not even a little. So... either that Tequila has something really good going for it, or... I didn't drink that much.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever happenned, I got more drunk-feeling than I have in months!  sigh &nbsp;   Brad would've won a prize... urlLink      ...and I was a whore of a social butterfly...     urlLink    urlLink      Dana (in the pink above) actually flashed for one of the pictures, but then I found out she erased it.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Not like I would've posted it anyway... unless she wanted me to, hehe.   Angie is friends with our friend Lisa.&nbsp; They are so fun! These pictures are of me and Angie, and then Scott with Angie and Lisa.&nbsp; Angie is related to one of the owners.     urlLink   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;  For some reason, I was being encouraged&nbsp;to slap this guy's ass. hahaha...&nbsp;     urlLink     These girls were fortunate enough to be around me at&nbsp;my peak... they were lots of fun, too. I think Chis and I were... talking to them, hahaha... uugh.     urlLink     After the shenanigans, Alan, Lisa, and I took off to sober up at Primanti Bros.     urlLink

      It's always a fun night with Jon Cho.&nbsp; He has a small (but very expensive) apartment in the Pennsylvanian downtown.&nbsp; Me and Gregg met him there.&nbsp; One of my best friends, Cho has the craziest legal DVD collections of anyone I know!&nbsp; He has stacks of movies he hasn;t even seen yet and I swear the only time he even considers watching them is when people are over commenting on how many un-wrapped DVDs he has sitting around, hahaha.&nbsp; We had some drinks and sat around for a bit. &nbsp;We were going to wait for some young girlfriends of mine, but then Cho reminded us that Sanctuary, where we like to go dancing doesn't charge a cover before 11 (I think is was 11... migh be 10)&nbsp;    urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink      Anyway... when we got there it was totally dead because it gets hopping pretty late there - and when it does you can;t even dance comfortably; I'd rather get there a little early most of the time.    urlLink    urlLink      Gregg wasn't feeling it and cut out pretty early.&nbsp; Jon Cho and I had a blast!&nbsp; After Sanctuary closed, we continued on and met my friends at Bella Notte (or however it is spelled) next to Rolands on Penn Ave.&nbsp; It was me, Scott, Chris, our friend Sean (in the baseball cap below), Alissa (in between Chris and Sean)&nbsp; and Jon Cho.&nbsp; Later,&nbsp;Carolina, &nbsp;who I met a DejaVu the previous week came out to meet us.    urlLink    urlLink      As per common weekend tradition, we went over to Chis for some after-hours fun and played Taboo for the rest of the night. Scott wasn;t into it at first. He and Caroline were on my team, vs. Chris and Sean...    urlLink      Alissa and ...uugh forget her name... fell asleep pretty early on the couch...    urlLink    urlLink       I believe we won, hehe.

        urlLink      Jenica and I have been hanging out a lot lately. She rocks! Last night, we went to this new lounge on Camp Horn Road called  urlLink Willow . It was really nice, but I got out there too late and the crowd had died by that point... In fact, they had already called last call. So, we went looking for another place to hang out and found a local bar called the Rochester Grill... where they seem to really like Kareoke. Good times.      urlLink    urlLink

       Nice and productive lately... every once in a while I'll hold a meeting with my interns to discuss the progress of the product we're developing together. Today was special. Last week I met with one of the program coordinators, Jackie Perhach, at a new charter school in Pittsburgh named  urlLink City High . They have a mentorship and internship program for technology and education. The school is focus on educating children using technology; all of the kids have a laptop and are exposed to more technology than at the average high school. She introduced me to three children interested in the internship. I suggested that I meet with the children and their parents this week toward the end of our internship meeting. They came and I discussed what I was up to and what I would expect from the children and the parents (as far as being involved with their child's progress during the internship). They all seem pretty excited about the opportunity for their children to learn this technology. This should be an interesting experience considering that these kids know very little so far... I'm getting down to the line with some of the things I need to finish and it's going to be a time commitment to teach them what they need to know.  sigh    Right after the meeting, I found out that my friend Gregg was going to be downtown checking out the Young Republicans (YR). We talked about going together... I was planning to go to the Ben Folds 5 concert downtown but the weather was really questionable, so I decided to go to the YR meeting instead.   I am still registered as an independent, but that's about to change... Over the last two years or so I've been working on getting rid of the many grey areas in my life. Through my investigation and all my politically oriented conversations, I just can't understand why anyone would want to be a democrat. My perception is that often people that consider themselves to be democrats really have a very soft platform of beliefs in that they usually say what they don't believe in or what they disagree with, but never really what they stand for. They seem to futily grasp for it in a pretty disappointing way. On the other hand, it is very clear to me what most Republicans stand for. It makes much more sense to me.   In addition, Pittsburgh really sucks lately; there's not many young people here, there's mostly an old boring REALLY REALLY conservative BORING... old population. Allegheny county has the second highest elderly population in the US out of all counties. uugh. While the city could be a good place to live and there are lots of fun things to do here, most visitors would never know; they're going to look downtown when they come and they'll see a dead city... all of the action usually occurs on the edge of the city - on the south side, in the strip district, and in Oakland... and the city transforms during the summer when the students are on break... and the city is bankrupt and corruption abounds. We need a new generation of politics and we need to get some republicans up in here ' cause... well, Pittsburgh has been run completely by democrats for a very very very long time and this it's no longer a city filled with smoot and unionized steel factory workers. It now all about technology, research, and entrepreneurship. The democrats are killing the economy of the Pittsburgh, uugh. It's just not working. So... I'm gonna get involved with Gregg and others and see what kind of difference I can make.   We all met at Bossa Nova downtown. I thought Gregg would be there already, but he wasn't. Most of the people that were already there were clicky and not very social right off, but I ended up making a lot of friends after all and my friend, Pat Doheny, who is a lawyer happened to be there too. I was surprised that he was a republican - most lawyers in Pittsburgh are democrats ... or say that they are.   We all went up to the office that they had in the same building at about 7:30 PM. I joined up. They had lots of (good) pizza, beer, and other beverages (and some pretty good cookies). It was also pretty social. I actually had a great time! We listened in on a conference call with Laura Bush and George W. actually got on to toward the end of the conversation...   After our time up there, a bunch of went back down to Bossa Nova and had some conversation and fun:   urlLink       urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink    Jon Cho came down and joined us... and then Alan did, too.&nbsp; I was trying to get Jenica and her friend to come down but they decided to take it easy.   urlLink   &nbsp; urlLink     Cho, Me, and Alan   urlLink     then... Guess where we went? hehe ... DejaVu of course! I got there first since Cho forgot to pay his bill and had to go back to Bossa Nova.&nbsp; It was a special night since the Playboy Playmates were there or something.&nbsp; I must have missed that, but I found my friend Courtney Lidell and danced and little.&nbsp; Jon&nbsp; joined me when he got there.&nbsp; Jon wants to change the name of our nascent party-throwing group from Old School Productions to Liquid Means... sounds good to me, we'll see what everyone else thinks soon I guess.    urlLink     Jon came back with a VERY strong drink - a manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess the new&nbsp;bartender didn't know exactly what she's doing yet.&nbsp; When I went to get Jon a drink a little later, she did it again; when she was done filling the drink it wasn't near full and of course I said something... she filled the rest of the way with Maker's Mark, haha.&nbsp; I do have to congratulate DejaVu on hiring what has to be the hottest bartender I have ever seen... wow.&nbsp; Her name is Coral rarrrr:    urlLink    I saw Chef James eating some ravioli and they smelled SOOO good... I spoke with him and he hooked Jon and I up with a deal on the same plate. YUMMMM!   urlLink    ...Alan was up there, too... and later Jeff Bagley, Scott, and Chris showed up to hang, too.&nbsp; After googling over Coral for a little we headed downstairs.&nbsp; Jon, Alan, and I hung out with Lacey and Daniel... man their crazy.&nbsp; I dated Lacey for like... a week a couple of months ago, but now we're just friends.&nbsp; They're pretty... Uninhibited, haha and a lot of fun.   Me, Lacy, Alan, and Daniel   urlLink    Here are the pics I decided were tame enough to post, haha...   urlLink    urlLink    And I made some new friends.&nbsp;I met this girl named Caroline, a fresh young professional.&nbsp; If I remember correctly she's graphic designer for a firm in the city.   urlLink    urlLink    Yeah... I'm sorry, but they forced me to&nbsp;grab her ass during this picture... I didn't want to... yeah, right.   urlLink    ...we left DejaVu at close and re-grouped at Primanti Bros. Restaurant there in the strip district.&nbsp; I was pretty darn tired... I really hadn't slept well the night before, uugh. Hahaha, I remember Scott and I keeping each other company on the way home.&nbsp; He had initially called me because he saw Coral coming out of DejaVu when she left work and was driving behind her... and just wanted to share. Fun conversation.

      My liberal friend, Alan invited me out to see Farenheit 9/11... I figured what the heck since it's probably historically significant, and I should know what it is expressing for the sake of conversation at least.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked my friend, Jenica joined us.&nbsp; She came over early and brought over some music I&nbsp;think is&nbsp;pretty cool including&nbsp;   Alan and Jenica at Loew's Theater     She's a democrat, too... we drove over to meet Alan together.&nbsp; All in all, it was pretty lame.&nbsp; It was all about Bush and why he sucks as president (according to Michael Moore).&nbsp; But how many presidents have we had that haven't had similar issues surrounding them?&nbsp; I mean, people get to be president for a reason.&nbsp; I like the way everything is going now, and I think putting such an opposite as Kerry in office right now would be very damaging to the economy and our country. Fuck that.&nbsp; Please don't take this as an argument in support of Bush... I don't have the time for that.  Then we went to Bar Louie&nbsp;on the Waterfront&nbsp;and had some drinks and conversation about the movie, etc...&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm waiting on some pics from Alan from last night.&nbsp; I'll post them when I get them.&nbsp; &nbsp; -Ryan Riehle

      Holy Crap! ...I use  urlLink Paytrust  to check, organize, and pay my bills. I've been using the service for many years - and I like it, because they will receive my  paper  bills and allow me to pay them online. Well, since I've started my company my income has been much more irregular and I've neglected (avoided, really) checking my bills and managing my finances, in addition I've cancelled most of the automatic payments I was making when I had a regular paycheck.   Now, my car insurance bill is mailed to Paytrust. I forgot that I turned off the automatic payment option for it, and I haven't been paying attention... the bill went overdue and&nbsp;my car insurance&nbsp;was cancelled mid-June without my knowledge! uugh.  &nbsp; Now I'm re-insured as of today, but the insurance company is required to send out a notice that I am not insured, which has happened once before... and then it causes a huge hassle, because the state will want me to fill out a form stating that I didn't use the car during that time... but I received three tickets during that time, too! uugh. &nbsp; -Ryan Riehle

      Wow... that was expensive... I just put in the paperwork in&nbsp;for my passort... finally.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also got it expedited.&nbsp; It costed me around $180 after all.&nbsp; Uuugh.&nbsp; The&nbsp; urlLink State Department's  web site provided some good information about what to do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't know that you can get the pictures taken right there at some post offices.&nbsp; The main post office is right around the corner from me so that was pretty easy.  &nbsp;  I woke up really early and I'm having a REALLY productive day so far.&nbsp; I also got some of my clothes in to be altered.&nbsp; I've been avoiding that for some reason.&nbsp; Just been lazy I guess.&nbsp; That cost&nbsp;some money, too considering how much I trimmed down my&nbsp;waist since I lost weight and have been working out.  &nbsp;  The truth is I went to the doctor yesterday to get tested for STDs since it's been a while.. no symptoms or anything, it's just that Jon Capar mentioned this article about them that freaked me out so I wanted to know.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Excerpt from  urlLink Men's Fitness article :  &nbsp;  "Perhaps most shocking of all, in the era of safer sex, is how herpes infections have increased by more than 30% since the '70s.

And then there's chlamydia, the most widespread of all STDs in the U.S. Chlamydia rates have soared by 37% in the past five years...But perhaps the most significant factor is that many of the infected have no symptoms, so they're passing infections on and don't even know it.

      Yes! I found my&nbsp;birth&nbsp;certificate&nbsp;after a diligent and intelligent search through my paper&nbsp;files and now I can order my passport tomorrow. Whohooo!   The weather is quite savage today - uugh. Pouring rain with breaks of sunshine - I'm looking for a rainbow.  sigh   Today was hectic - I&nbsp; volunteered to help at Holy Family's Golf Tounament being held at the Sewickly Golf Club and was supposed to be there at 9 AM, but still had the U-Hail we rented for the party and the DJ equipment. So I had to return that this morning and found out that the place we rented the DJ equipment from dowsn't open until 10 AM. uugh. So I rushed over there, dropped off the equipment and rushed over to drop off the U-haul at time since it had to be returned by 11:30 at the latest. I'm still recovering from all the fun I costing over $150 more that I expected it to! Then, I got lost going to the Golf Course... by the time I go there they hardly needed any more help. Oh well. It was nice to see them again.   Then I had a Dr's appointment at 2:15. Just a checkup, hehe. And then I came home to look for my birth certificate and get some work done. I just ordered some Chinese food and am getting pretty hungry. Hope they come soon!

      I can't find my birth-certificate anywhere yet and I MUST turn in my passport application ASAP.  uugh.  On top of that, tomorrow is such a busy day.    Today has been long enough as it is and so I'm exhausted... I got up early to clean up from the part we had last night, and then me, Rob and Jon Cho went to eat lunch in the strip district.  We went to Rolands and I had a lobster roll... it was pretty good.  They were so hung over hahaha.  sigh     I could go right to sleep... but I'm considering watching a movie and I do need to find that certificate... but I also have to be up really early tomorrow. ick.   Then I went to Sandcastle and bought a season pass... now I can go all I want.  I have to get this body tan for Trinidad, you know. It's gonna be hot, hot, hot. Chris and Scott have passes, and I met Heidi there and she got one too.. so I figure I'll have enough company to justify it.  EEsh... I'm so tired and lazy.  I'm going to calm down on the drinking front this week.  I'm gonna focus on work and working out.  I'm convinced that I can gain a lot of muscle quickly in the mext 2 months or so.  I am already seeing a diference with the working out that I've been doing already - that in itself is motivating.  I'm about to be away again for a while and I need to find a place to work out in NJ....hrmmm...  Ok. Goodnight.    -Ryan Riehle

       Happy BirthDay, Chris!  urlLink      Uuugh... another night of too much fun?  Nah... just right.  Most of the fun happened during the morning, actually - nobody slept last night, haha.  I met Chris and Scott at the Shady Grove in Shadyside.  It was a beautiful night out.  When I got there I also met some new folks that I haven't hung out with yet:  Brad, Ron, and Jeff.  We had fun together all night.  Scott got Chris a big piece of birthday cake that we all shared.      urlLink     Me and Ron  urlLink         Ron and Brad(In front)  urlLink      Then, would you believe it ...we went to DejaVu, haha.... Someone bought Chris another piece of cake... it was tiramasu actually... I talked up my party.  Looks like we're gonna have an GREAT crowd tomorrow night. I'm so psyched.      urlLink      urlLink       urlLink      urlLink       urlLink      urlLink       urlLink      urlLink        We hung out outside of DejaVu for while... where we made a new friend names Scott and firted with young hotties like Tricia in the pink - hot. Hope she comes to the party, hehe...    urlLink         Chris and Scott  urlLink     Brad with Tricia and Friends...  urlLink        Then we dropped off Brad to his place downtown and went to party at the house of another new fiend, Deran.  Deran lives on the Northside.  What a great apartment!  He had a great view of the city across the river. We hung out for the rest of the morning with Deran, his girlfriend AMY, and their friend Jodi.    Deran likes to cook, too.  He had some big pots on the back patio where he grows his own basil, peppers, tomatoes, and some other herbs.  I spent some time with Amy talking about her Jewelry - she was showing me some pieces they bought at Banana Republic that were pretty nice.  I love jewelry for some reason - I think it's because it makes me think of my parents... they love to shop for jewelry together and I always tagged along. Anyway, we had fun checking out her jewelry.  At some point I remember dancing in the livingroom with Jodi.  And Scott fell asleep as some point.  We had some fun taking pictures and fucking with him about it, haha... Here are the pics:   Jodi, Daren, and Amy  urlLink      urlLink      urlLink  #666666; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/img/291/1204/168/PICT0397.jpg'>     As you can see... the sun was shining when we left...    urlLink      and we ended our time together with breakfast and conversation at a diner in the Strip District.    urlLink      ...I still need some sleep... time for a nap!   -Ryan Riehle

       Portugal is booked... finally...     urlLink      Thanks to my abundant frequent flyer miles, it's finally happening this time;  My parents and I are going to Portugal at the end of the summer.  I leave on September 22nd in the afternoon and on the way back I'm going to stop over in Germany on October 3-6, returning to the US on October 6th.  I'm psyched! Now, to plan my trip.  My parents aren't coming to Germany, unfortunately... so far I'll be there by myself - but I'm totally ok with that.  I also have to expedite my passport since I'm going to Trinidad soon.  I found that I can do it all at the post office.  It's going to take 2 weeks to get it and I'll have to pay $60-$80 additional. But it's worth it.

       Fireworks and Parties       urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        After we got back from rafting and dropping our friend Lilly off near where we were rafting, we drove back to Chris' place.  I picked up my car from there and went home to freshen up.  Now, we thought the fireworks were supposed to start at 10 PM, but they were scheduled for 9:30 PM.  I find this out from my neighbor Betty at about 9:15 PM...uugh.  So I rush up to Mount Washington see the fireworks and get caught in tons of trafic.  That's what I get, I guess.   Mount Washington is my favorite place to see the firewaorks from because the view is amazing.  The trick is to go all the way down to the west end of Grandview Ave, a little ways down from Monterey Bay resturaunt.  From there, one can see the city skyline, the fireworks downtown, and the fireworks in the neighboring communities.  It's very cool.  Unfortunately, we were all late and didn;t get to see the fireworks together - I only saw the tail end of them myself. Oh well.  In my hustles to get to a good place to take pictures and look around for people I know, I lost the little pouch I keep my camera in.  Oh well... I'll get a new one.  After the fireworks, Chris and Scott picked me up to go to some parties we knew of.  They followed me while I parked my car and we hit a local gas station so Chris could get some smokes.  Chris sell and promotes wines and liquors so he happened to have some new Malibu Pineapple in the trunk and some plastic shot glasses - which I used to catch up since they already had a bunch to drink, hehe.   Warming up with Chris...  urlLink      We went to meet our friend Danielle at a party her friends' Dan and Eliza were having. They had food and drinks there - we had fun!     Me and Eiliza  urlLink     Queen Danielle  urlLink       Outside with Dan  urlLink     Danielle and Renee  urlLink        We went to another party, but it had already fizzled out so we went back to the first one and had more fun.  I have lots of fun video from that night... I'll have to figure out how to stream it into this blog.  When we tried leaving we couldn't find my keys because they were in Chris' car.  On the way to my car we saw Chef James from DejaVu and hung out for a few minutes on the street.  Everyone was a little happy, hehe.   Chef James on Gandview  urlLink      After everything died, we got the bright idea to go to after-hours at 1814 in the strip.  We were pretty tired from the long day and didn;t stay too long but I got my dancing fix with some girl I met there. It was a nice, full day.    Chris and Scott at After-hours  urlLink     Me and Nick (the owner)  urlLink       ...as you can see, I had my fill.  I was pretty tired and went home and crashed.  My head hurts pretty bad, uugh. I think I'll be taking it easy today... though my phone's been ringing off the hook...   -Ryan Riehle

       A White Water Adventure!        Chris' friend Lily put together a white-water rafting trip for the 4th of July. This is the 2nd year she's done it.  Chris invited me about a week ago, and I'm so glad I chose to hang out with them instead of doing anything else. It was such a great time...  I woke up yesterday morning and ran over to Chris' place to meet Chris and Scott (who were both very hungover), so we could leave together for  urlLink White Water Rafting  at Ohiopyle, PA on the lower Youghiogheny river. This was the first time I've done it - man, it was awesome!  We left a little late, stopped at Starbucks, and rushed over to Ohiopyle.  The adventure was scheduled to start at 12:00 and we got there about 5 minutes late. It wasn't a problem since everyone was still getting ready.  We signed some papers, equipped outselves with life-jackets and helmets, and took a short bus ride to the launching area.     Scott, Chris, and Me  urlLink     Me, Lilly, and Chris  urlLink          urlLink        urlLink        Our large group was combined with other groups.  They didn't have enough rafts distributed so they had to grab another one for us since we were the last ones to sit down. I shared a raft with Lily, Scott, Chris, and Lily's friend Marianne.  Then , one of the guides gave us detailed instructions about how to raft effectively and safely. Stuff like how to hold and use the paddle and how to work together.  Chris got chosen as the captain.  The captain's job is to direct everyone on what to do. For example, when we're supposed to turn left, the captian will yell "back left!" and the people on the left side will back-paddle and the people on the right will paddle forward.  The opposite is true to turn right... and to paddle forward, the cpatin yells "All forward!"  We got the hang of it pretty quickly I guess, because we usually came out in front - even in the beginning.      urlLink      urlLink        We carriend the rafts down to the river and launched off the shore. After paddling around a bit, the guides came out and gave us more detailed instructions.   Getting our feet wet...  urlLink      What a great time!  Most of the time, out boat (#28) lead the whole group right out in front. We fooled around with seating positions a few times throughout the trip and finally decided on Scott and I being on one side with him in front, and Lilly and Marianne being on the other side with Lilly in front.    It was a hot, beautiful day so every time we reached an eddy we'd take turns jumping into the water. The water was cold and refreshing. I had my running shoes on and thought that having them in the water would be wierd and uncomfortable, but somehow it wasn't bad at all.  At one point we had to get moving and we were out of position.  As we were trying to switch seats with each other we hit a rock and light rapids and Scott fell out of the raft.  I tried grabbing him and missed. Chris was able to catch him and them I grabbed Chris' foot so he wouldn't be pulled out of the raft.  As this is happening, I look behind be to see some major rocks and rapids coming up.  urlLink Aaaah!   We were able to pull Scott back in, but it was crazy. Wow... so much fun!  Only one person was hurt on our trip (not one of us)... one of Lilly's other friends, Maureen, needed stitches because her knee was cut open after being thrown from her raft. Awww.  They took great care of her though.      urlLink      urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        Mid-way they served us a lunch of sandwiches and fruit and some water. We were pretty thirsty.  During lunch, Scott and Chris found a small animal skull and Chris decided to keep it.     Us with our guide, Hank  urlLink      We were exhausted after the trip, but we can't wait to go again.  We talked about the possibility of pitching in to buy a raft so that we can go anytime, but maybe it would be a much different experience without guides after all.  The portion on the river we went on had an average drop of 25 feet per mile.  We're considering going again, but to more challenging rapids.  We're now planning a trip to on the  urlLink Upper Youghiogheny  river in Friendsville, MD where the average drop will be about 115 feet per mile with 8 foot waterfalls, etc... and I hear that for one of the miles, the average drop is about 225 feet!  urlLink Class V rapids , baby!  Whohooo!  Hopefully, I'll be able to make it since I'll be traveling a lot soon.    -Ryan Riehle

       Introducing... Danny     urlLink      I've been a mentor (like a big-brother) since about 2000. It all started while I was a catechist for the Catholic church.  Well, I had gone to the Diocese trying to participate in the youth group program since I had such a great experience with it growing up in NJ. At the time, they didn;t need any help with that, but they did need CCD teachers. So... I agreed to teach 7th grade CCD for the Diocese of Pittsburgh, and found it unfulfilling - mostly because the children knew so little, I expected too much, and  many of the parents didn't teach their children anything at home. uugh.  So, I started looking for other, more effective ways to contribute myself and my mother suggested being a big brother.  I looked into it for a while and eventually found Holy Family Institute.   urlLink Holy Family Institute  (HFI) is more or less an orphanange.  They house children that have been moved around frequently and have no where to go... or children who have unstable homes.  I've had two children so far: For a while, at first I was with a child named Ray.  Ray later kicked another kid in the head without being provoked and had to go to jail more or less.  Then, after a few months I was presented with the opportunity to mentor Danny.    Danny and I "clicked." We would go out all the time and do things - go to the movies, play video games at my house, go to the museum or the science center, etc...  After a while, Danny was doing pretty well and got the opportunity to leave HFI and go to an assisted living program in Beaver County (almost 1 hour away) with a high budget.  So off he went and now shares a whole house with one other child. HFI asked me if I'd like to take on another child, but I decided to stick with Danny and focus my attention on him. In the new placement, he is constantly supervised - most of the time by 2 staff members, and pretty much gets all you can ask for (when he's good).  On the other hand, he seems really lonely and he is sad about his family sometimes (can't blame him).    urlLink      When he first moved to the new program I could still take him out and do things with him... until we found out I wasn't supposed to.  So... the only way that we could figure out for me to have the same relationship was to go through getting certified by Beaver County as a foster parent.  It took me about a year because of bottlenecks I experienced. Druing that year or so, we would talk on the phone and I would go see him sometimes, too.  When I would visit, we would play video games together and pretty much just hang out.  I took Danny out for the first time in a long while in April. It was great.  Now I wish I had more time to spend with him...  When I went to the Cake concert, I thought it would be something Danny would enjoy doing.  So, I decided to take him to see Hootie and the Blowfish since they were playing the next night.  I was hoping to pick him up at about 11:30, but ended up getting there at about 2:15.    On the way to Pittsburgh, I got a speeding ticket. blah. 81 MPH in a 65 MPH zone... how beat is that?!?  Anyway, we got down there pretty early, and there was a lot going on because the 3 Rivers Regatta is also going on and - so we had a pretty full time together. He are the highlights:  I brought along a blanket for us to chill out on in the grass there at the concert. So we picked a good spot to put it down and went walking around. It was a  hot  day. The first thing interesting that we see is a navy helicoptor show.  They demonstrated a rescue mission by dropping two people in the water and "rescuing" them.  It was pretty neat.  I caught a lot of it on video.      urlLink      urlLink        After walking around a little bit, Danny bought himself something to eat...    urlLink      After he ate we walked around some more and watched a Jet Ski race and freestyle show.       urlLink        urlLink      urlLink        In the meantime, Danny see one of his friends and goes over to chat and hangout.  He's standing in the wet zone and get's soaked from head to toe!  It was hilarious!      urlLink      urlLink        We walked around a bit to see if it would help dry Danny off. While were doing that, special operations troops came by to visit:      urlLink      urlLink        The Hootie and the Blowfish concert started at about 8:00 so we sat down and chilled out for a little.  My friend Heidi came down to visit with her friends Jenn and Jenna.  Jenn is the one in the light blue and Jenna is the tall skinny blonde:    urlLink     urlLink     urlLink       After the concert, Danny and I waited around for about an hour trying to get a picture with Hootie and then gave up. oh well.  I dropped Danny off and then went to meet Heidi and her friends out at DejaVu.  Heidi and her friends left the concert before me and went to the bar at the Hilton nearby.  They met an older couple that was visiting Pittsburgh from Ohio for vacation and I guess Jenn invited them to come out to DejaVu with them.  When I got there, Jen's husband Bill was there too.  He bought me a round and we went dancing.  The woman they met in the hotel was really drunk and was hitting on me and all these other guys on the dancefloor.   She was crazy!  She actually got annoying after a while, haha.  Heidi and the annoying drunk woman  urlLink     After DejaVu closed, Heidi and I went back to Bill and Jenn's apartment with them and chilled out.  We watched Scary Movie 2 and Bill cooked up some burgers and we drank some beer.  It was good to make some new friends.   -Ryan Riehle

       Some Cake at the Point   Got some work done today... and went to the chiropractor. All the driving I've been doing lately really threw my back out of shape!  Then I worked my back pretty hard the day before thinking it would help and it just made it worse.  It's all good now.    I also picked up the rent from my tenant.  I have a section 8 rental property in the city of Pittsburgh.  It's very cool to be a section 8 landlord if your tenant is fully subsidized; that is, if they don't make enough money to pay the rent so that the housing authority pays ALL of it. But, my tenant got a job and now has to pay part of the rent and is frequently late since she started having to do this - really late. So, I asked her to pick a date & she gets paid on the first Friday of each month so that is what she picked.  I told her that if she doesn't pay the rent on time there will be a $50 late charge and I will make hersign an agreement that will allow me to put a lien on her car is there is a problem collecting rent. She paid on time this month, and I think she'll continue to - I would.  I also got some work done - a lot actually, somehow.  Made changes to the software I'm developing and released them to the customer pretty quickly.  And then...  Cake. Kate IM'd me this morning telling me about how Cake was playing at Point State Park for $1.  Nice. I love Cake.  So I made some calls and most of my close friends had plans.  I ended up getting my friends Chris Bokelberg and Scott Nagle to join me and I went down earlier than them to catch a good lawn seat with my blanket.  It was a nice night.  I parked in a garage near the west side of the city on 4th street - it's always $5 there no matter what. I carried my blanket down to the point and saw my good friend, Judy Herilla, there with one of her friends. Very cool.  So, I sat next to them and bought some beer.  We chilled out while we watched the opening band, Good Brother Earl, perform.  That was interesting because one of the band members, Paul Fitzsimmons, was a fraternity brother of mine while I was at the University of Pittsburgh.  We don't hang out anymore, but I see him from time to time.  After Cake played a few songs, Chris and Scott showed up. I really enjoyed the concert and even got a picture with Vince Di Fiore - the man on the trumpet. And he is  the man  on the trumpet, the band would really be incomplete without him.  Scott Nagle, Vince di Fiore, Me, and Chris Bokelberg  urlLink     Chris Bokelberg, Scott Nagle, Judy Herilla, and her friend Aleda  urlLink     Sunset at the point with Judy and Aleda  urlLink       And of course I had my new tiny handy camera on me to take pictures (and video).

       Spideyman - 2! Whohooo!   Woke up this morning and decided to see if my good friend, Jon Capar, wanted to work out with me this afternoon instead of working out by myself at home.  He did. Cool.  He belongs to the Three Rivers Club downtown, and we work out together there from time to time.    Then, I booked my flight to Trinidad.  So, it's official - I'll be leaving on August 7th and returning the 12th from Newark, NJ.  Now I just need to hurry through getting a passport. uugh. I also confirmed my plans for the 4th of July - going white-water rafting with a group of friends... it should be an interesting first.  I hope to get some pictures somehow.  Today went very well with the software;  my customer is getting very excited and a progress keeps getting accomplished more quickly as my interns learn more. It's pretty cool for everyone.  Now that they started using it, they are able to give me a lot of good feedback about how we should enhance this early version.  At about 2:30, my friend Haris came over.  She's from Cyprus, which I found out is a  REALLY  small country on an island near Greece and the middle east.  The speak Greek in Cyprus.  She just graduated with her MBA from Carnegie-Mellon University and has had a hard time finding a suitable marketing job, so she's probably going back to Cyprus toward the end of June.  She doesn't know the area well and asked my if I'd take her to best Buy so she could by a video camera, I obliged gladly.  She came over, we caught some sun in my back yard, and then we went to Best Buy.  She bought a Scanner and Sony Handycam... seemed like a pretty good buy with lots of features.  I bought a Paralell-to-USB adapter and an larger SD card (256 MB) for my new camera. LOVING the camera - here's Haris out in my back yard:  Haris out back...  urlLink     After we were done, Haris left and I spent some time working and playing with my camera. My darn ISP went down for a few hours today and I was frustrated because I couldn't send e-mails out! My other friend Jon Cho wanted to go golfing and Heidi wanted me to join her at Kennywood park tonight, but I went a met up with Jon  & picked up a bottle of wine while I was waiting for him. He and I had a nice workout, during which we got excited about grabbing dinner after at Dave abd Buster's and catching a mid-night showing of Spiderman 2. So after we worked out, we went to his place so he could change and I could freshen up. He's got a nice setup over there, inclding a sheepskin rug in the middle of his living room that somehow really works - I want one.  Jon's Place   urlLink     Then we went to the Waterfront to eat and catch the movie. We went to Dave and Buster's for dinner, then we hit the Grocery store - since I'm going to be in Pittsburgh for a while, it'll be nice to have some food around. We had a nice time just hanging out since we haven't for about 2 weeks.       VIP at Loew's... ahhh  urlLink      Start the movie already!  urlLink        The movie was great, but now I'm so tired now...  I worked my back pretty hard tonight, and I'm sure it's gonna hurt terribly tomorrow. uugh.

       Home, Alas!   Drove back from NJ today.  Damn, it's good to be home for a stint!  Ariane called me late last night asking me to be her date for a wedding in NYC on the 24th, so I guess I'll be going there again around then. Sounds like fun!  I love meeting new people and I was planning on going back on the 28th, anyway.  I went on my date with the real-estate girl.  She's really cool and I had fun talking to her.  She's most likely not my type, though.  But she could turn out to be a good friend.  After that, my friend Heidi invited me to go miniture golfing with her since she had some free tickets.  I had a lot of fun!  It was very cool.  And to my dismay, she won the round.   urlLink    My friend Heidi, tonight at Golf World in Fox Chapel.  Oh! We ended up seeing a fox in Fox Chapel!  How 'bout that... It was so cool! And yes... I'm sure it was a fox.  I almost ran it over - it passed right in front of my car on the road. I was going to try to get a picture of it, but then I thought of dudes on horses trying to catch a fox and decided to just let it go.
