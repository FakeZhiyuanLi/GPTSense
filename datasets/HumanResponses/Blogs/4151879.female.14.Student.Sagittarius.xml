      Wow.  Nobody missed me.  Oh well.  I just got home, but since I love you guys so much (and I had nothing to do for hours at a time up there) I wrote two entries while I was up there.  Enjoy.     August 9, 2004  – Oh, I'm a lumberjack and I'm okay...   Current Music:  	Year of the Rat / Badly Drawn Boy  Current Mood: 	 spent  In the mountains, w00t w00t. Played Pictionary a lot today.  There's a secret meeting of some sort of cult thing out at the campsite, so we couldn't go into the woods today.  Plus, there's that paranoiac fear of West Nile Virus.  Paul was out shoveling dirt (he's going to try to build a bike ramp in the three days here, even though I don't think he brought his bike) he disturbed a hornet a/o wasp nest and got stung twice because one of the little bastards got in his shirt.  I thought this would instill in him a flaming animosity and fear towards the outdoors, but apparently not.  All of the boys went outside with David's slingshot and after a half an hour of running and hiding, they obliterated the yellow foes and strutted back up to the house, dusty and triumphant.  David and I have been doing the whole Crywalker dialogue lately.  ("All in favor of taking a Man Vote, say 'aye'." "Aye!" "All in favor of Cloudchaser taking the Crywalk, say 'man'!" "MAN!" "We have taken a Man Vote." "We have a Mandate." I've been cooped up in the house mostly, watching CMT and gorging myself on Pringles.  It's awesome, opening vacuum-packed foods up here.  The thing is, like, since the air pressure up here is lower, the air inside the package pushes out and the package like swells up and then the food flies out and totally nails you when you open it.  I just explained to Jonathan the saga of Nickel Creek music videos. "Didn't a girl get hit by a car in one of their videos?" "No, that was Hoobastank." "No, I mean—" "Okay, in one video they were roaming around on a beach, in another one they were roaming around in the forest, in another one they were in a movie theater watching themselves play, and in one they were just jamming in a music store." "...Oh." ...I left out Lighthouse and This Side.  Dammit.  Jonathan figured out how the satellite works, so we kiss his feet. Big deal.  I've hooked up satellites  and  TiVo boxes in my day.  Daniel's ditching us right now.  He quit his job with notice, and he's in his last week.  We told him to blow it off, but he's being all manly and responsible and finishing his duties as Wendy's cashier.  Wants to send himself off right.  I like TEWTALLY missed my Dead Like Me.  And it was a new episode!  Oh well.  That's what spoiler sites are for.  That reminds me: There's no internet up here.  I'm gonna die.  When I get home I'm going to [after going to the beach with Hayley] put my plan into motion, meaning I post posters that read "Everything is going to be all right" in seemingly random places in the neighborhood.  Not enough people say it these days.  Well, I'm going to write my stories, so I'll close.     August 10, 2004  – Harold and Kumar Go to Ice Castle   Current Music: 	High & Dry (how appropriate!) / Jamie Cullum  Current Mood:  	 listless    Quote of the Day:   You laugh because I am different.  I laugh because you are all the same.  ~Jonathan's shirt  Ah, yes.  The ineffable wisdom of T-shirts.  Is it just me, or has someone put a curse on the Lakers?  Kobe's on trial, Shaq is gone, Peter Jackson is gone, Rick Fox is gone  and  divorcing Vanessa Williams (shame too, because they were both so  pretty ), their new point guard (or something) just went to prison for two years on, like, drug charges. The Lakers need to parade a goat around the Staples Center like Cubs did, or something.  I like the mountains kind of.  Despite the biting flies, the freaky dry air, the sweltering heat, the dead trees all around, and the mysterious cult thing out in the middle of the forest that chants and sings in the night, it's fun.  It feels like it hasn't changed since when the pioneers found it.  Everything's attuned to nature, there are natural wonders everywhere... I don't know.  It's just cool.  Today is Tuesday, and so we went out a-ropin' for something to do.  Grandma seemed to want to go out on this hour and a half boat tour, but we knew there was no way we could keep the boys in good behavior for an hour and a half in  a boat , and Michael said it was just a laundry list of all the celebrities that had homes on Big Bear Lake, so she gave in and we went to this sort of park/ski grounds with a year-round dry toboggan thing.  I'm proud to say that my bubble butt (Mom says I have an "hourglass figure") gave me plenty of inertia and I was careening down that hill in no time.  James kept crying into Mom's stomach because he wanted to get Burger King, but I ended up flinging him at a bench because he was so dang stubborn.  He's starting to show the symptoms of being the youngest child.  So we turned down Burger King, but of all the places we could eat lunch in the mountains, we found a Sizzler.  Nothing unique and rugged and mountain-y about it at all.  They had a freaking  salad bar  and soft-serve machine!  The pioneers did NOT have the luxury of Tastee-Freeze!  OR heated cabins with satellite TV,   Grandpa!!!!    We went up to Keller's Peak today to climb up into the fire tower (which is up on top of the mountain and is staffed with volunteers who watch for brushfires 24/7) and look down at San Bernadino from afar.  There is this sort of veranda thing all around it that people could walk on, and there were these two bird feeders hanging at about eye level.  I swear, you will never see so many hummingbirds in one spot in your whole life.  There were like 12 circling around one of them (they didn't like one of the two for some reason) and then when the wind blew, more of them came out of the trees so that it added up to about 20 hummingbirds.  And I didn't know that hummingbirds made noise.  It almost sounds like a little beep, it's so short and oddly low-pitched.  As we were driving up to the tower, we saw this rock that was remarkably shaped like a pair of buttocks, and so David and I insisted on pulling over.  When we drove down, Mom parked at the side of the road, and we kids all lined up, getting a lovely detailed shot of Butt Rock.  Grandma didn't get out of the car, (A) because she was afraid for rattlesnakes, and (B), she didn't necessarily want her picture taken besides a giant sandstone rump.  We went ice skating down at the Ice Castle, some place where Michelle Kwan used to train.  We got there like super early, and public skating didn't start until 7:30, so we waited around for half an hour, and we looked in, and there were kids, most of them Asian, practicing and training, and ALL of them were at like national competition level.  We were really scared for looking stupid, but at 7:30 they shooed the kids off the ice and took this special truck that spilled water over the rink.  A lot of them left, which we were glad for, but then it took like 15 minutes to pay for tickets and get our shoes on.  We were kind of worried because we didn't know if our ankles were  supposed  to be completely paralytic, but apparently having them like that was safer than having mobile ankles.  Something about stability.  I dunno.  I was pretty good at it, I guess—alright, I was better than everybody else.  I couldn't really corner; cornering gave me problems.  But other than that, I was passing everyone four, five times in a row before they up and got off to sit by the sidelines and massage their aching shins.  And since it was a training center, they never played hockey there and so there were no handy walls to skate along.  David totally bit it about five minutes into it and now complains that he has a concussion.  After like half and hour, I had figured out how to turn and how to stop, and David and John just sort of wobbled along the edge the whole time.  It was really hard to skate for very long without this brutal burning feeling that crept up through the ankles into the shins, so I'd usually run the little weird circles about three times and then crash at the edge of the ring.  The place closed at 9:00 and we were the last ones out.  We got lost enough that these other people from the rink who heard us asking for directions offered to guide us to highway 18 (one of the most measly highways in the world, by the way) from which we went to McDonalds and then drove home with McFlurries and fries in tow.  San Bernadino looks so awesome from the highway, I wish I got a picture.  I've got to sleep.  Big day of packing tomorrow.  Before we go, I hope to head to the House of Jerky at the bottom of the neighborhood.  Ostrich jerky is so good, man.  You have no idea.  Always listen, Molly  PS:  The night sky out here is so awesome.  You see stars you didn't even know were there, and then there are all these little stars you can barely see behind the stars you're used to.  I love it.  If I wasn't so afraid of West Nile, I could just gaze at the sky for  hours.        PICTURES?!!!      This is our dinky cabin.  We fit eight people in there, yep we did.    Oh God, my hair was so flat.  Stupid dry air.    I give thee... BUTT ROCK!!!    Harold and Kumar go to Ice Castle

      I have no opinions on anything today. Really. I've even forgotten what day I'm in. I have nothing to put in the subject line. God help me.  I'm going out tomorrow to put posters around the neighborhood. I won't tell you what they say or why, etc., but I promised myself I wouldn't tell and HEY.  Here I am. If you want to see them, drive down a few major streets in Rossmoor and you'll probably pass one or two. Don't tell anyone it was me.  ...The lead singer of Hoobastank's eyes are really far apart.  Uh...     RANDOM PICTURES OF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE!      [Chris Thile]    [Callum Blue]    [Jason Mraz]    [Jamie Cullum]    [James Taylor.  Lotta names that start with J, I notice.]    ... Uh...     ...I'm sorry you had to see that.

      What the heck?!  I just wanted to post to the JibJab blog, and now I have my own?!!!  What gives?!  Ah well.  I have like literally a dozen different blogs, half of which I know I have but have forgotten completely about (if that makes any sense.)  I really have no purpose for this blog.  I mean seriously, I can't think of anything.  I've got a blog that chronicles normal daily life, and the same one that holds my rants and random tirades when I feel angry or sarcastic (because yes, some mornings I do wake up feeling sarcastic), and I have another blog that is for the deeper workings (i.e. things that scare me, trouble me, personal problems...), and then another exclusively for fan fictions and other literate workings of the sort.  I don't really need this one.  But I wanted it.  Because I like starting new things.  Like sentences.  Even when by doing so I totally throw off.  The whole continuity of a sentence.  Uhhh...  I got two new CDs at Target today... which is cool...  Uhhh... I'm going to go biking when my mom gets home... which is also cool...  Uhhh... My fat neighbors have a rockslide for their pool and I can see their blubberly cadavers flopping around over the top of my fence... which is uncool...  ...KMart smells.  Love, Molly
