       I've been listening to a lot of music, soundtracks especially. I love John William's Prisoner of Azkaban score, and it's not because of Hermione.  More recently, I've been hooked on Howard Shore's epic, magnificent Lord of the Rings score,  the Hobbit theme, and oh my gosh. I can't believe I've been missing out on such stuff for that long a time.    And Pastor Prince is back, and his messages are better than ever, God bless him mightily!    There doesn't seem to be any direction in my life right now, I'm just living it day by day. I guess it's the JC routine that's getting at me, but whatever the case, it sure beats experiencing emotional swings up and down like last time though. I'm still looking forward to the end of the year, after the Promotional exams, where the Hobbit theme can play again, where I can enjoy life without worrying about schoolwork,  at least for 2 months. I'm looking forward to my new Apple iBook or iMac, and spending Christmas with my family. I'm looking forward to going out with Sylvia, my friends, Chee Yew and gang, and my 4 Integrity classmates.     But it's just the doggedly style of living life every day right now. God, life isn't really exciting right now, but I don't know. Do I want it to be exciting or simply filled with routine? But it surely beats some people who're *still* struggling with relationships now.    I am blessed. Although right now, feeling unpurposeful, it's hard to see.    But I'm blessed. Because Jesus loves me. And God's favour shines on me. God, I want to wake up each day feeling on top of the world, because I know you hold me in your hand. With you, I rise above the storm. Like Potter on Buckbeak, so am I with you, on eagles' wings. But the only things different are that there's a storm going on way, way below us. And I won't fall off.

       One of my friends recently announced to the collective rectum (that is, me and hanzhong) over the vile, evil chat service provided by Microsoft that he was going out with the choir president whom I know. Oh, it's nothing, he would say. I don't think I'll be able to  jio  her, but I like her!  Initially, I was caught in a state of disarray and confusion. Why would that friend of mine ever hit it off with the choirgirl? Firstly, I have never seen them to even appear to know each other in school. Secondly, me and that friend of mine only got to know her through Leadership Training, and the three-day camp was the only point of contact we (supposedly) got with her. Of course, they don't even look visually compatible. What followed was so absurd that I could hardly keep myself from laughing like a fool in front of my monitor. Like the full moon turning Lupin into a werewolf, the power of unmetered love was transforming my friend into some desperate 14-year-old twat that's so eager for a woman.   Hmm, I want to get a present for her birthday!  What can I buy her? Chocolates? A bouquet of flowers?  Make her origami? *lets out a horrendously girlish giggle*  Eh, don't want bouquets  lah , later she go home so  paiseh !   My poor friend. Cartwheeling head over heels into mortal love is not a very good idea, I've realised, after you've been in and out of it. He thinks he's all primed and ready to do a Spiderman in her life, and to "care for her and cherish her". And to do that, he will have to embark on a quest out of the comforts of the Shire into the great unknown to "build up his confidence", especially in front of her. In the meantime, my friend confided, that he must not let the choirgirl know that he's not confident, or else he's scared he'll be be stigmatised as being weak. Weakling, dude. Again, my poor friend.  And this was where the devil came taunting me. You see, he would hiss. Someone who doesn't know Jesus can enjoy such a love life. But you? What good is knowing Jesus as your Lord when you don't even have a relationship with a girl just like that friend of mine? And even though I ended my own relationship years ago, the hurt and the pain still came flooding back.  So I logged out and went to open my bible. Thank God for my campus caregroup. I met them for the first time on Sunday, and they've been really great folks to make me feel at home and all. And the message Geri preached... about being at the right place, at the right time, was great! And it was about the testimonies of the revelations they received from God, some on a very regular basis, that led me to start doing quiet time anew.  The bible opened to Isaiah, and I was reading at random. A lot of the verses I read were on God saving Israel, God being gracious, perfectly suitable, perfectly good verses for the situation I was in. But somehow, they didn't really speak to me until I reached the familiar passage of Isaiah 53. By that time, I was desperate, and was scanning through everything, not really taking time to read everything properly. But God still caught me.   Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted.   But  He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.  ::isaiah 53, 4-6   I know Pastor had expounded this many times before pertaining to healing. But now I thank God the translators decided to translate it in error. I was also scanning this through when God stopped me dead. "Go back from the start and read it again, slowly," He said. And so I did, and when I struck me, it totally blew my mind away. The revelation was right in the open, and I didn't get the full gist of it until now. Jesus borne my griefs and carried my sorrows. That one I know. I saw Jesus stricken on the cross. Naked. Devoid of human form. Blood flowing down his massacred body. The twisted muscles trembling in shock and his brow wincing from the extreme headaches caused by the pierced forehead. And we thought, boy, such a poor thing, for God to allow all this to come on Him.  But God said, Jesus was wounded, I allowed it to happen, because of your sins! To remove your sin, to remove your disease, to remove all guilt and shame and pain and suffering from you. I loved you so much I wanted you to have peace forevermore. And there is no way for that to happen unless I chastise my only Son, Jesus! And for every sting of the whip he bore, for every pain and every drop of blood that bled out of his body, my disease is gone. Removed and taken away. And if God loves me to such an extent, why should I accept the devil's lies?  And who cares if my friend's in love with a mortal and I'm not? Read on.   Do not fear, for you will not be ashamed; Nor be disgraced, for you will not be put to shame; For you will forget the shame of your youth, And will not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore.  For your Maker is your Husband; The LORD of hosts is His name; And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel; He is called the God of the whole earth.  ::isaiah 54, 4-5   This was where God stopped me again. I prayed while reading, that I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling, since the choirgirl and my friend's relationship doesn't have anything to do one bit. So I told God I know this is covered at the cross, and asked God to speak to me. Tell me the things I need to hear for my problem. And so it seemed that God's talking about shame down here. What exact kind of shame, I'm still finding out, but it's interesting to note that  shame  and its compound words appear 3 times in the verse. Am I ashamed because having a girl is the new in thing, which I do not have? (although it's been the sorta in-thing for as long as we can remember) Am I ashamed of myself because I failed to keep my previous relationship? Or am I ashamed about something else?  But that's not important. The clincher's the last verse. Somebody's madly, deeply, earnestly in love with me. I'm His precious beloved, whether I choose to believe it or not. And when times are down and out and when I'm in the dumps and don't feel loved, He always holds my hand and never lets me go. With Him, I soar above the storm, above all my troubles. Because the one who's obessively in love with me is nobody ordinary. I read somewhere that if you use a blackboard and dot 2 dots on it one inch away from each other and take that distance as the distance between the sun and the Earth, you know how far the next nearest star is from Earth?  7 miles away. For the metric challenged, 11kilometres away from the dot on the blackboard. And that's just a small little fraction of how vast actually the Maker of the universe actually is. But He still cares about the small things. He still cares for me. He must have loved me so much, He allowed His Son to die for me.  Forget mortal love. My Maker's love for me is supernatural.

       Basically, blogs come in different varieties and abound with content styles. I've done most of them, from the first few 'testing' posts to the (unfortunately) most common 'what-did-I-do-today' rambles and rants about (school)life in general. Then I moved house to the more thoughtful, more insightful blog entries about life, how good and how bad it can get, to musings about your everyday everyday occurences. Somehow or rather, I have never gotten round to blogging about technology, like  urlLink Daring Fireball  or specially mantaining a blog to post about specifics like web standards and the like. Well, maybe when I get my iMac or iBook at the end of the month, I would have fallen so in love with Apple that I might start a fan site. But let's not digress.  I think I may know why so many blogs out there haven't been updated for months and years, and why some people grow bored of blogging. Yes, even the very very good blogs that don't do the 'what-did-I-do-today' thing. I feel a sense of regret for all the wannabe bloggers out there, my friends included, for starting out blogging as writing journals of where they went, what they ate, who they talked to, and who they insulted (or insulted them, which among bloggers seem to be the more common occurence). It's a rather senseless fad, publishing your journal online. Most people who blog like that don't actually keep a pen-and-paper journal before they discovered the electronic version. If they had even tried to, they'll know perfectly that it's tediously humdrum to regurgitate everything you did in that day just to translate it into a book.  Seriously, nobody really cares what you did today, who you went out with today, who you screamed at today. However, most bloggers discover this the slow way. It's not a matter of how many hits or comments you get at your blog; if it's that way, the interest will surely wane, the desire will fade away. If you had ever peeked at a pen-and-paper journal that's supposed to be kept really secret, it's not itineraries at all. It seems that the general (around my age) blogging populace have got the wrong idea after all.  What I really admire and bookmark when it comes to content are blogs that choose to tell stories based on everyday occurences. Blogs like these reflect a thinking, dynamic mind of the blogger, who doesn't give weight to the things that revolve about him, but simplistic, daily events that revolve around his environment that most people shrug off as mundane. Being able to sit back and behold the very down-to-earth things of this world and to be able to convey that particular sense of preciousness and value and worth of something simple. It really makes me think that God, although he created the enormous, big things of this universe like the galaxies and stars, also give as much depth and focus to the small little things of this world that go by unnoticed.  Perhaps that's one of the reasons why photography has always appealed to me. Of a picture speaking a thousand words? Maybe. Photography, although extravagant sunrises are nice, also chooses to focus on the simple, plain, but yet beautiful snapshots of our everyday world. Such blogs are a rarity nowadays. Paperdoll's gone, and Faith is not blogging anymore too. I would really love to see some local blogs of that kind of standard. Anyone give me some?

       I want my iPod and my iBook. Nowww. *growls* heh.  I just found out that Pastor Prince still sounds very good even after I ripped his message cds to 32kbps, 22.05kHz, mono MP3s. Which means, I effectively cut the size of his messages from a full CD (800MB) to just about 17MB without any drastic loss in quality. Which means, when I get my iPod, I'll be able to fit tons of midweek and Sunday messages inside. Hehex. =)  And I need to study. I want to get better results. And I know the Promos are coming. Don't have to bug me. So... I need to start studying.  I want to open a bank account. Check the UOB TX savings account out! Gosh, with a minimum deposit of $20, no monthly service fee, and a *get this* complimentary Visa debit card... oooooh!!  And yeah. God, I don't want to become so darn materialistic. Jesus, you're my treasure. Not the world.  School's starting tomorrow. I will need to study. Argh.  Yep jO~ happy Singapore day!!

       Mediacorp has apparently caught on the frenzy of producing those anal, long-winded shows on Channel 8, modeled after the infamous  Zhen Qing  on Channel U. First came Holland V, and now, they're showing the Happy Fish show. And it is very, very boring. The characters are larger-than-life, in a bad way, and althought the script-writers tried to avoid stereotyping any of the characters, they still ended up looking really one-sided. One is a woman who so desires for money, even from her own family, but can't seem to make it on her own. The scenes where she wallows in her own self-pity does little to remove her stereotypi-ness. Similarly for another female and her husband, money-minded, with 2 spoilt kids.  That, by itself, is a huge problem. When it comes to the storyline and the narrative, event after event just happens to the family, one after another. There is no attempt to link them up together, and more often than not, the show just harps on a few of the characters crying over what has happened, while still thinking about money, and then life goes on. There is simply no development, which makes the show appear really really shallow, and uninteresting to watch.  I totally cringe when I see, for example, in today's episode, the scenes of her(Jia--?) crying and sobbing and wrenching her heart out for her dead husband. Apparently, the storywriters love to harp on these scenes, where it just makes no sense for development, and adds negligible value to the storyline. Not that it has much of a storyline, a good, interconnected one with depth to begin with anyway. It simply makes no sense to see somebody cry for someone who's lost, and you don't feel her pain yourself, because of lack of depth, and I just couldn't stand it. After all, we live in such a world already, where instant news of death and suffering are available in your newspapers. Why do people still want to turn to the TV to watch these kinds of shows?  Bring back shows like  Fu Man Ren Jian . Now that's a winner, one of Mediacorp's best dramas. Not some shitty, glued together plot like what they're having now.
