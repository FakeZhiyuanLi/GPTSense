						      The storm had ended and as the elderly man took his dogs out on the pier for their evening walk he noticed a small figure of a girl, alone, on the beach, frantically rushing around throwing small shapes of something into the tormented surf. He hurried closer.     "Hey there, little lady," he called out, but she could not hear for the waves.     The pier stretched out far and it was an age until he reached the sand and still the girl was throwing objects into the sea with great haste. "Little girl, little girl! What are you doing?"  As he approached he could make out the shapes as starfish. Thousands upon thousands of starfish all washed up on the beach. The storm having beached them all in its fury.   "I am throwing these starfish back into the sea." she replied, "Come! Help me please!"  The man did not move the beach was more starfish than sand. "Come, help me please!" she cried again, still maintaining her task, hurriedly throwing starfish into the water. "Please help."  The man moved over to her and as she went to cast out another creature, he caught her arm; she turned her head, eyes open wide to face him.  "Why do you bother with saving these creatures?" the man asked, "Look at all of them, you cannot possibly save them all. What does it matter?"  The girl looked down at the starfish in her hand and then back to the man and said,  "To this  one  ......  ..... it matters."  and she cast out it as far as she could.

						    I have been living the insane dream. The dream has been living through me. The ceaseless automaton of people seems to slow man's obsession with having to be.       Survival, extinction: a final valediction, surpassed by explosion, expansion and willful conviction. The routine of boredom of convention of living covers the silver lined clouds of compassion that blocks out the convoluted rays of salvation from bathing the world in radiating light. It reduces expression to minuscule dimensions and squanders the ability of intention to decision no rationale for a debatable day. The rule of reason which establishes what is heard and what is silenced is undiciphered and then lost. I live on, I am the human race when you think of yourself you see my face.

						     Of Proliferating Exigency    Propaganda persists But it is despised,   Though we are affected by all it implies Stereotypical images conveyed    Results in prejudices overtly displayed.  Enforcing unity While resentments arise,  Weakens the effectiveness of all who preside. Without the will of society outside Intervention is no more help than disguise.  When consolation is merely mockery Consolidation fails; When unification is in jeopardy Separatism excels. While dissent only accents the feelings here voiced, The factions remain discordant. Until all becomes one Any difference that has begun Will continue though even more so.

						     The Unexamined Life       Six billion people breathed across the Earth. In and out without even thinking about how they managed it. Six million people thought six hundred billion thoughts without spending too long wondering why they thought them. As the smallest fraction of the six billion passed by the elderly gentleman at the bus stop neither he, nor they knew why they were on the move and he was not. His wrinkled, life-worn hands clasped around the top of a stick and his eyes staring into the nothingness of memory. Six billion people and yet many had gone through their lives without even knowing of this one person’s existence.      His life was a living legend; a history book that still breathed life into a forgotten past. The past that was carved in Braille on his face and every expression he made was the culmination of six billion thoughts, some of which lasted only milliseconds and left as soon as they came and some remained resurfacing for air with every new association his brain made. A thought for every person alive though none had one for him. But why, why do we follow the story of this man, a man whose only achievement was to be alive today and whose fame is known only to the ones who are lying in the soil?     Time for a change, the purpose of this story is not to explore this man’s past; we are too late for that. We have no right to see the story; we only have the chance to know the stories. Where does the future lead from here? Time is short, you are either here for the remainder or you are one of those passing by and in the time it takes your thoughts to appear in your head the man we are following will fall down dead. First I would like to provide you with a summary of this story:      An elderly gentleman sits waiting for a bus to take him home, two bags of shopping by his sides and his stick in his hands. Suddenly the heart is stopped, the breath is ceased and his time ends. As the body falls to the ground six billion thoughts are all in the mind at once and nothing to recognize the life that is run in front of it.      I trust that you have enjoyed the story. Many thoughts; some real; some imagined; some hoped; some dreamed. All of them making part of his character and none of them making yours.

						    The Beginnings of Life   	In a maze under the scrutinizing light of a scientist’s bulb, a mouse scurried from corridor to dead end to corridor and out again. All the while there was an eye staring down calculating the point where intelligence met awareness and it could not see the connection. 	The mouse was picked up and it became fastened to a piece of wood with minute manacles. It could not move away. The life force grew strong in panic, but could that be isolated? With lasers all the hair was removed and the heat was increased to prevent the effects of the cold. Still the mouse remained as strong and as afraid. The scientist removed its tail, lasers for a clean cut and a searing closure of the wound. Although shocked, the life remained strong. One by one the mouse’s toes were removed until they were no more than rounded stumps, but there was no change in the body’s actions. 	The scientist paused, she could see this would require more serious work and the mouse was sedated. One by one she cut off its limbs down to the sockets and the wounds were closed. Held to the piece of wood by two straps around its remaining body. The heartbeat maintained itself though with slightly less pressure than before, less body to receive blood.  Its ears were carved away; its eyes gouged out; its teeth pulled away and its tongue cut out. Life remained.  In exasperation the scientist sliced the mouse’s brains away, tossed it aside and somewhere in between the life disappeared and no amount of careful science could explain how.

						    No prison can hold me   Incarceration – The prison that has held me is my own construction Freedom – I am free – yet I stay Reason – There is none  My freedom is a temporary as sunshine in a cloudy sky. This is my perfection – what freedom is permanent? To be restricted only serves to make the temporary freedom I have all the more perfect. Then I can use my time without needing to consider the basic needs of food and shelter and security. I am free.  Why do need freedom?  Are you languishing in pursuit of happiness even when you are free? Freedom is clear from pressure. Freedom is clear from your past. Freedom is postponing all thought of the future. Freedom is the present.  It is the ability to ignore what you have done. It is the decision not to fear what may lie in store. It is what you are seeing now and what you take from the experience.  It is halfway up a mountainside. It is watching the world walking passed in a coffee bar. It is sitting in a workplace preparing a report on your staff.  Freedom is knowing life changes just around the next corner.

						    You are what you want; you are not what you need   “I need wisdom,” said the primitive man. “I need escapism,” said the downtrodden man. “I need somebody to mock,” said the intelligent man. “I await my death,” said the wise old man.  “Banality makes me dumb,” said the downtrodden man. “I understand,” said the primitive man. “I have walked in your shoes,” said the wise old man. “Hah, ridiculous,” said the intelligent man.  “Occupation and motivation is what you require,” said the intelligent man. “I wish I could feel this,” said the downtrodden man. “What do I need to experience,” thought the primitive man. “Only time will unfold your undiscovered dream,” said the wise old man.  “I escape to nowhere,” said the downtrodden man. “I have been everywhere, nowhere is the only place I have never been,” said the wise old man. “I do not understand,” said the intelligent man. “Lead me, show me where I can go,” begged the primitive man.  “You’ll all see, now, I need escapism,” said the wise old man. “I await my death,” said the downtrodden man. “I need more wisdom,” said the intelligent man. “Then, I shall mock you all,” said the primitive man.  “I understand,” said the hermit. “I can change the situation,” said the saviour. “I can stall your efforts,” said the self-blinkered anarchist. Time said nothing, it only passed.

       drawroF ehT                        Thank you for receiving this with open arms and thank you for actually taking the time to read through this forward, which quite frankly no-one ever seems to read; to be quite honest this is really more than my job’s worth and the really amusing thing is that even though the rest of these pages are actually filled with something, I have now completely run out of anything to say and, as you may be realizing, this sentence is currently going on and on and on and on and on and on and still on because if it stops I am not entirely sure if I can think of a way to start another; also if I do start another, who knows where it will end up. Here is the next sentence anyway and this does not seem to be going anywhere in particular, so it will now stop. This sentence, however, knows exactly where it is going, unfortunately it knows that that somewhere is nowhere and so this one will similarly stop like the first. This fourth sentence knows where it is going and what it is going to do when it gets there, its larger purpose is, alas, only to introduce the next sentence which is coming now.    This final sentence in the evolutionary chain knows, not only where it is going and what it is going to do when it gets there, but also realizes its surroundings and has made a reasoned choice to become a purposed orientated sentence that will lead to other sentences which in turn will bear forth enough combined knowledge so that the whole sentence’s existence will not only be assured, but also remembered, rejoiced and reconciled for many sentences to come. This situation has led to the fine and outstanding classical novels that grace the bookstores of every town and which then become part of every child’s education and reveal to the world how very different everybody was all those years ago.    However, it seems the life of the sentence had reached saturation point and now sales of sentences have slumped; not only sales of sentences, but also, authors have encountered such droughts in the letter pool that today some sentences are only one word long. This situation needs your help, please for the sake of language, culture and the right to total freedom of expression, save your words.    By speaking just one less word every time you talk you will be helping an inarticulate child somewhere in the world. Just one three-letter word can keep a whole family in poverty communicating for a week.  So please save your Words and help someone speak.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; It was only two steps to the front door of his caravan, but it was two steps that destiny was never going to allow him to take. The day had been a struggle – a day where the hours flew by with all the grace of a dead duck and lunch was over before he had left the sandwich bar. “Damn queues!” he said, cursing the other people who had dared to get lunch at lunchtime. So on this day – a day he vowed from this point on to only eat homemade sandwiches and water at lunch this happened.   &nbsp;&nbsp; It was then fate took a proactive role in the life this poor, unfortunate and unwilling hero.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lightening had never struck the same place twice, which made the next instant even more unfortunate than it might otherwise had been for Ralph Mortimer, but he would never know that Rev Lloyd was struck twice only two years before. There was no reason why he should, Rev. Lloyd live 5,000 miles away in Brasilia. Having taken the first of the two steps I could now change the story, but then I would have to admit my free will. Free will doesn’t even exist in the mind of the author; the story has taken its course and Ralph was suddenly struck where he stood.   &nbsp;&nbsp; At this point I would like to make it clear that I do not wish torment and hardship on any of my character; these things happen; it is beyond my control. The idea comes to me I put it into words and I write it.   &nbsp;&nbsp; As he came to terms with the fact his heart had stopped he fell to the ground facing his neighbour’s caravan. Ironically the lady there was being treated by paramedics for a heart attack with a defibrillator. This was enough to shock his heart into recovery for long enough for a thought to enter his consciousness on the smell of wet compost. This served no particular purpose and so was forgotten. His brain in its vulnerable state also forgot to steady the heartbeat and he collapsed again. Ralph began to die.   &nbsp;&nbsp; As he lay there with the world disappearing into the distance of a blinding enveloping tunnel of light, his mind in an effort to detached the physical body from the stress of dying flooded his entire diminishing consciousness with images of little fluffy clouds and disjointed memories of loved ones. While his blood stopped flowing, cutting off the oxygen to vital organs he was pumped with more chemicals than a truck of vallium and paracetamal could ever reproduce. The world was a tiny point of focus by this point, Ralph floated at the far end of this tunnel his eyes had created. Like an ancient television set reducing the pictures to a single spot he had reached the end transmission of the soul, which would make wonder why his last thought was, ‘what happens now?’

      Emilio Gonzales woke up in Penzance  Syringes in pockets and drugs in his pants  Claimed it was all for medicinal use  The police ignored his feeble excuse  And when he tried to escape their clutches  They broke both his legs which left him in crutches.

        The Battle of the Bilge    40,000 men fought in 40,000 wars With 40,000 reasons to justify the cause. 40,000 guns fired 40,000 rounds With 40,000 enemies shot to the ground. If the 40,000 bullets had been 40,000 more They could have all shot themselves and we’d’ve called it a draw.
