      Dear Hap,  I watched "The day after tomorrow" @ jubilee at 11.55pm 29th May. It was a midnight show and i watched it alone. The cinema was almost full, filled with many couples and lonely people like me. This is the first time i watched a midnight show alone in the crowd. The movie made me realised, like many things in life, simple things like sunshine, good weather did not come on its own. Illustrated in the movie, it was doomsday forecast. Indeed, global warming is an issue that is troubling many nations' geologist, however, few nations actually attempt to do something. Emissions are still high, and many still concentrated on their own economic development and contribute to the global warming.  In the recent years, more and more hollywood movies are moving towards doomsday forecast. "Independence day", "The core", "The perfect storm", etc. They, didn't do it for nothing, probably like what was illustrated in the movies, someday, these might happen. The question thus becomes, "When will it be?" We shouldn't just ignore warnings and take it as, somebody else will do the job. Alas, its just a norm that people behave this way.  Unlike all the movies, romance that bossomed, i doubt if the real scenario actually take place, i will have the chance to have some romance. If i don't have it now, i probably won't have it later. Isn't that so, hap?  Its late.. almost 3 in the morning. See you later, hap.  Love, DJ

      Dear Hap,  Last night, i asked my friend to tell me what was the message shared on Sunday service.. "God is smiling at you, you know.. everything is gonna be alrite." Instantly, i knew that message speaks to me. For months, i have been looking for a suitable job because i hate to slack. Although freelance for IT is good money and your time is flexible, it contains no career planning or prospect. Its like the story of the chinese farmer waiting for the rabbit under the tree. I called that, "PATHETIC". I was suddenly recalled that, before every breakthrough, things seem to be at its worst. I thought, probably and went Zzzzz..   This morning, i drag myself to SSDC in AMK to have my theory 3 and 4 lessons. Luckily, the lesson was quite a breeze coz' the instructor didn't concentrate much on the books, rather he speak more of social skills in driving. At this point of time, Mr Ling called to re-schedule the appointment to half an hour earlier and thats 9pm. I thought its gonna be some kind of interview, instead, he brush the idea aside and say its some kind of cooperation. Well, i anticipate it to be more of taking advantage of me perhaps. Guess what, Hap.. Julie called!  I told myself earlier that if i get this job @ 77th street, its definitely a job that God get me. Julie, the GM called! I was offered the position!!!! And, last night when i got the message, i was "Gosh, the message speak to me... and a little hopeful". What makes me so sure that this is God's will? Well, 77th street has religious link to City harvest. Julie, the GM who stunned me @ the first interview is a beau, and i saw a cross on her. *Ya, flame me hap... i'm a guy and she is really that gorgeous, so why can't i get stun by her?* Later, i realised that the founder is from CH.. I remembered Pastor Prince say, "There is no such thing call coincidence.. everything is God's plan." Although i do not know what he has ahead for me, i believe he wants to mound and prosper me.   Hap, at this point, you must be wondering what religion do i belongs to? I dun consider myself a christian coz that would bind me to a specific belief. But, i do believe and trust God. God to me, is similar to the God in the bible. I do believe, also Buddhism and although this may seems erronenous to many people, but i thought it also stem from God, but humans, due to not expose to the other parts of the world of other beliefs, divide this belief into a separated one. The God i believes, is the God of all beliefs. I do not want to restrict myself to just Jesus, but i know he loves me and i will not allow anybody to speak ill of him either. This is confusing, i know, but He understands, otherwise why would he prosper me? Yup, God is good. :)  Another thing capture my attention to write actually. After i depart SSDC AMK, i went to the AMK library to return my chinese novel (damn touching story) and got myself another one (also romance story, heh heh). As i walked towards the exit, the alarm went off. Apparently, some idiot walked out of the library without scanning the book. The librarian rushes out and called the teenage back. The fellow, act blur, continue to walk (he din even walk faster!!!! damn stupid moronic arsehole).. Guess what? He hide a book beneath his shirt.. I was like, "Damn, you want to steal a book out of the library and you din even attempt to escape when thay caught you?!" Oh man, this is some damn bloody stupid and moronic, like the NYGH gers i know, they love to say, "Spastic".   2nd day i dun see Mandy online... i guess, she had start to avoid me.. I just hope, God also prepare my dream date for me, coz i doubt i will be walking around on the street scanning for my future wife.. Shit, im reminded of Mandy again... no mood to write already.

      Dear Hap,   I didn't where to start too. I went to the car show today, saw a lot of couples but that wasn't my concern.. Had sushi today, saw a cute ger and she knows im looking at her, but that wasn't my concern.. I watched Windstruck, "Ye Man Shi Jie" and it become my concern..   For a moment, i thought i had forgotten how to shed my tears from touching love story. But watching her cry over her beloved's death, cause my tears to roll out of my eyes without hesitation. I felt her heart, not the actress's real heart.. but the role she plays, i felt her emotions. I thought i know how it felt for a moment.. As i'm typing, my heart is also tearing.   It really kept me wondering, why didn't i have anyone to love me like that?  Or why didn't i love someone like that? Is it that i wont cherish the girl if i meet one or i don't deserve her? Can God be more merciful this time round and bless me with somebody like that? Somebody who will risk her life to save mine, likewise i will duck a bullet for her? Someone who will swear spinister hood if i ever died.. someone who will love me regardless what will happen to me? Someone who love me with her own life like how i will love her with my life..  Reality check... NO.. I seriously doubt such girl exist. Mandy refuse to accept me and i know if i persue her further, it will be pointless. One day, if she recover from her grief, somebody might comes along and take her away just like that. It happened twice on me.. and all they ever said was, "Sorry, i didn't expect something like this to happen." Well, neither do i.. *alas*  Think for a while, i have no looks, no $$ and currently jobless.. who would fall for me? It pains.. but.. *heavy sigh* My heart is broken, hap. And i don't have plans to mend it. It should be broken, otherwise i will keep thinking about somebody who i may love..   No one can replace you, because there wont be a 2nd you out there.. No one is better than you, because you cannot compare people with people. First, there is no basis of comparison because there is no agreeable standards to compare. 2nd, comparisons are subjective thus, it will not be reliable. 3rd, i will never agree..  Hopefully, my future blog wont be filled with relationships..  DJ

      Dear Hap,  The movie really make me sleeps.. and the chair make my back ache.. But of coz' i watched because i know Mandy wanted to watch it. If i remembered correctly, she is suppose to watch this with her bf? Ya, since her bf isn't coming back anymore, and her friends probably watched it already, i just accompanied her to fulfil her wish.   I know... this is the substitutional effect but i just don't feel good telling her to get lost. As usual, she rejected me flat tonight. As usual, i felt i suck.. Guess, it will really take a miracle to take place if she is to accept me? *lol*  Oh well, i don't feel quite good about almost everything. Hap, this girl is special. I can tell myself countless times to forget her. I can get confused with other girls, but no matter what happened, i never seems to get away from her or get tired of her. Of coz' that doesn't mean that she should accept me..  God.. if you dun intend to give me this girl, please make me forget that i was ever in love with her... i really appreciate your kindness...  Broken heart, DJ

      Dear Hap,  I met somebody interesting.. So interesting that i felt, she is weird! I was bored.. and went IRC for a while. As usual, tonnes of male flock to my nick. As ignorant as most Male Singaporeans are, they didn't realise my nick is that of a German wine. I don't blame them for that, but they really made me feel disgusted..  Then, she appeared and we chatted. Shes 21, NUS and was quite nice to chat with. Later, i asked for her MSN for more convenient conversation.. Obviously, phone chat is the ultimate goal. But.. after the phone chat, she became kinda distant. I gave some thoughts to it and realised she became distant after i told her i'm not interested in relationships at the moment..  Yup, one of the kind coz i never meet woman like her. She's weird and i gotta admit that.. Hap, why would anybody be so anxious to find a bf?! She is still young, and i always thought that girls would prefer to know the fellow long enough before the friendship advanced to another stage?   Am i wrong?! Gosh... oh well, just to share my thoughts with ya. Going out with Mandy later. Watch her fav Hairy Potter... :/ Frankly, i dun quite like the fellow, coz its too magical?! Anyway, just take it as an entertainment bah. It would be nice to give her some company too, afterall, we have been friends for some years.  I have an interview @ 77th Street tomorrow. This is the first time i applied for something that's in I.T. and i'm not familar with a couple of requirements they mentioned. Perhaps, i should really drop my HR mentality and start to go for jobs that i think i do not meet their requirements fully. Sg's HR is really weird...   Oh well.. read something about Time travel lately.. Intriguing material. It certainly interest and affect me deeply, but i doubt i want to change anything dramatically. My past consist of good times and bad times, and if i were to upset them, God knows what may bring?  Seeya again, Hap  DJ

      Dear Hap,  Im so bloody tired.. but have to force myself to go to work. Really wish to get a perm job but does not reside in IT, at least i can still take IT as a passion or something additional for my personal development.   Mandy's bf had told her that he isn't coming back to Singapore for good. Not something unexpected to me, coz' i had tried to make her face the truth long time ago. Woman.. they preferred to be cheated and then cry over it. Yup, thats plain stupidity.. That, however reflect badly on the guy, which most of the time, might also be a victim in some areas. I wouldn't side Mandy, coz' i know if i merely take her one sided affair of the story, there would be an issue of devil and angel. I fell into such shit before, where i became the devil and the ought to be devil became angel. Woman.. they are so adorable, yet sometimes they can be so scheming.. Alas.  Nothing much to write actually, coz my thoughts are more or less settled for good. 77th Street called me up for an interview this comin Wednesday. Little known is, they are bloody near to my residence! Although the location of the company does not reside in Shenton way, personally, its not bad already.   I really wonder.. when will i be able to crave a niche for myself? I bloody nua for a damn long period of time.. This is so degrading.. So what if i earn more? At the end of the day, its only notes that does not give you much prospect. *Arghh...*  Gotta leave, otherwise might be spending my evening in that bloody office again.  DJ

      Dear Hap,   I know you are going to screw me after this blog.. Yes, i don't know the answer myself either.. Why the hell am i so fickle minded?! Old flame and a new love.. only thing in common is, both are attached and both love their bfs.. Ya, i really feel like taking a 100 tonne hammar and smash my head... Shouldn't me at least wake up my idea after all these while?  When Mandy see this blog, she probably will feel ease that she didn't fall for me... Hap.. i feel down.. If Aileen gets married, this will truely be the ultimate regret i will ever have.. There is nothing i can do, except to wish them happiness.. I'm envious.. but thats the much i can do.   This morning, i went jogging.. ya, to vent my anger and regrets.. Yup, pretty dangerous coz my body almost couldn't take it and i almost fainted. I'm too disappointing! I was the one who initiated the broke up with Aileen, yet until day, i still carry the torch for her! Damn... I tried.. i tried... i told myself, she is not a babe and i must be shallow.. But, the truth is, i didn't fall for her looks, i really fell for her.. the person she is. That's why, until today, i still feel... in fact, very much for her. It was hidden, didn't surface until i called her last night. I didn't know abt it prior.. I don't know how much she had changed, i just hope, she is still the person i love.. At least, i can continue to keep this feeling deep, hidden where its supposed to be hidden..  Hap: You sucker! What about Mandy? Thought you felt for her?! DJ : It wasn't fake.. i really do... i really don't know anything now.. i'm too disappointed in myself, too disappointed to face myself.. i will pray that they are happy with the ones they love.. i will..  Hap: What about your's?  DJ : I ruined it 4 years ago.   DJ

      Dear Hap,  I went fishing today, with my cousin's family and my primary school classmate. Nothing unusual happened but it was really great fun, teasing one another whilst fishing and chatting. Yes, you know this ain't the main course for the blog. :)   Of all my girlfriends, there are two of whom i had deep regrets. One of them is Junie, the gf i had when i was J2 and she was in YJC in the 1st 3 mths. Got to know her thru' my help out to my friend's OG. We broke up because she wanted to go TPJC and it would be diffcult to maintain the relationship. It was absolutely silly because Singapore isn't really big. Her birthday is near and i called her to see if i can catch up with her, also to give her birthday greetings. But, her phone number changed and its another person taking up the call. I realised, i havn't been calling for the past 6 mths because i would be able to realise this problem if i did. Fate ended. *alas.. sigh*  The 2nd one happened 4 years ago, when i was serving my NS and, she was Sec 2 in CHIJ TP. We broke because of the major age differences but i didn't tell her the truth until last year i think. Nevertheless, it is too late. She already has a boyfriend who is very much older than me too... That is not important too, because the important thing is, she loves him. I called her and her number remained the same..   She remembered and recognise my voice. The last time we chatted was more than a year ago. And that time, she also recognised me. My father's funeral, she dropped by after i sent her an SMS. If you are to ask me why i broke up with her since she is so good, my answer would be, i was silly. And of course, its all past. Although i still kept the sweet email we used to send one another during those days because her parents were very strict on her. Yes, it was very sweet but i didn't realise it. I'm always this silly..  As a man grows older, he tend to need more friends who understands him than lovers. Because i have lost my desire and affections towards lovers, *i think i do* i need my old friends and pple who understands me. I'm glad that she still listens to me but i didn't know how much she had changed. But, this time i will know.   Friendship is rare, especially when you gets older.   Hap: What about lovers? DJ : Lovers only appear in fantasy. I don't have my hopes anymore. Hap: What about her? DJ : Mandy? She loves her boyfriend.  Hap: And you don't mind he mistreats her like that? DJ : I can't determine her road. She has her own life. Hap: Don't you love her? DJ : Ya, but she doesn't. Lol. So, i will try to forget her. Hap: Do you think you can? DJ : No... but i will do my best.   ------------------End of Interview--------------------- "P  Love, DJ

      Dear Hap,  Everytime i looked at a gorgeous lady, i could only say this, "She is beautiful, but she is only this beautiful." No man would resist having their second look at a charming lady. Perhaps, some would approach and attempt to befriend her. Some would probably rape her mentally. Some, would be like me, smile and walk away.   Why walk away?  Some things, are better to leave it where it started, that is beauty.   When i look at an ancient vase, i could be reading a tall tale of how it was created, survived centuries of environment rampage, but not yield a single damage. My perception of the vase, "no matter how great it seems to be, it is only a vase."  Zen mediation took place in my mind. I have begin to investigate reality to where it comes from. If you are to ask a physicist what is reality, he probably tell you its electromagnetic waves, gravity and 2 others.   In other words, the things we see, the wine we drink, the food we ate, the woman we loved, are just that 4 elements. We have all been fooled, by our senses. We have been confined in our mind, in the world we first created in order to shelter ourselves.   If i close my eyes, i see nothing.. because there is no light reflecting the beings, causing images and objectifications to take place in my brain that is recepting the information.   Wisdom.. is to see through the point of suffering and end it. Compassion, is to help others to obtain wisdom.  Just like the Matrix.. the two colored pills.  I would also take the stance of NEO.  DJ Evolution has begun. Are you excited?

      Dear Hap..  I gave her a necklace i bought but when she said, "Its my 1 yr anniversary" (referring to her necklace), my heart virtually broke into pieces.. You know, all the previous thoughts about me wearing the necklace for her and the romantic moments i dreamt abt before she come, vanished.. it never materialised. *listening to somebody now  Of coz.. its not her fault..   I opened my eudora and check my email. Chanced upon some old email i kept.. its from my ex gf. I smiled.. and i realised, i was happy but i didn't know what was happiness then. Looking back, i realised i had happiness before. If attributing all these pathetic state i am currently in to my retributions, i think i would feel better but, no.. the old Dijiang is dead. I am not somebody who takes shortcut and easy way out now.   Yes.. the problem lies with me. I didn't know what i wanted. I didn't have a direction, nor a focus. That was why my previous relationships didn't work out. And yes, as much as i like to get married, i have phobias towards marriage. Which is why, when my relationship advanced near to marriage, i will wreck them with my own hands. I am fearful towards the idea of two person living with one another until death..  Hap, i know somebody had been in my situations and path before, and there are much more other less blessed people than me.. At least, i can spend my energy thinking about relationships, they are spending their energy to stay alive. But if i am to think that i am more blessed than them, is totally wrong.. They have the will to live.. I don't. If God is to strike me with an illness now, i would lost the will to live.   I am no difference from the living dead...  Hap.. how do i save myself from all these mud? .. i know i can't hide from you.. Ya, i'm diverting all my attention to other stuff so that i can forget her.. yes, i know i can.. and i must forget her. I must forget her smile... her voice and everything about her that captured my heart...  I really hope.. she is happy now..  DJ   .. wisdom is, when you see through suffering and desire.

      Dear Hap,  I managed to check up the SSDC stuff and will be going for the theory lesson on the coming friday. They have e learning too but i probably prefer the primitive class room environment. Just now, Inventis called me with regards to a job application i applied on 17th May. Its kinda 3 weeks ago and they probably did not manage to find the appropriate ones. In other words, i might be their last resort.   I have been repeating Somebody since 1pm. The strange thing is, i did not grow tired of it. Neither did i grow bored.. Am i really in serious deep shit now? Coz' i felt really in love.. Nevertheless, no matter, i have to go away..   Going for her is definitely not an option. I can't be selfish to make her accept me. Neither should i be pestering her when her heart is with somebody. Right now, she is still msging me thru ICQ.. Although its crappy, i smiled.. Somehow, she might be that person.. Or am i hallucinating? Maybe.. Time will tell.  Hap, wish me luck? :)  Misses you..if you know.  DJ

      Dear Hap,  Am i wrong to do it to her? I felt very different and guilty about lying to her that i am busy.. Wanted so much to speak to her but i know that would only burden myself more. But, what if she needed somebody? Must i act indifferent and be so cruel to her?   My presence might even cause her troubles and unhappiness. I don't know what may happen when her bf is back. Although i know that even if his heart changed, she will still love him that much as before. Ya, Hap.. i should get myself over her and do something else. Shouldn't be like a pest and hope that something may happen.   Hap, falling in love is difficult.. forcing myself to fall out of love is even more difficult. I can't force her to accept me either. Can only blame myself for getting into such shit.. :~(  Hap.. *hugs* Tks..

      Dear Hap,   I realised it is not as easy as i thought it would be, to forget the person you love. Seems like over the years, the women i loved never accepted me.. Women whom i don't really love became my girlfriends. Thats also why, the relationship did not stay too long because the affections  were not present in the first place.   Hap, maybe the one i love and may appreciate  me have yet to come. Or maybe, she never exist. No matter what, i believe i have come to a point where i must be able to accept a plausible reality that i may stay single for the rest of my life. Its a blessing to be able to share your happiness, woes and smiles with the person you love. Its definitely many times better than me sitting in front of the monitor now and try to share my woes with myself.   Hap, it wasn't easy to fall in love again.. and i thought you knew. But.. yah, that does not mean that the person i fall, must reciprocate my feelings. I know.. i really do. But, i promised myself to look forward, to accept reality, to never run away from it, so that i will never reach a point in life where i could no longer retreat. Reaching that point is like reaching the top of the cliff where if you retreat, you will fall to your death, no i should say worse than death because death is a form of escaping away.   Hap, your name is the short form for Happiness. 'Hap'.. thats why you are the best person i can relate and the best name i could find. I want hope and i know hope never fails to come by in my life. I don't know if i would love another again. I only know it would be even more difficult to do that again. I know she really love her boy a lot. I know what happened to her relationship, but because things will never be possible for us, i also know that, regardless of any efforts, amount of time or feelings i inject, it will not change the fact that, she loves him.   DJ, you can face it.. because you never fail to face it, Hap.

      Dear Hap,  Its morning.. and i had a dream. At this point of time, i could only stare blankly at the screen, because i do not know what to type. My feelings are too mixed and my expressive words are too limited, nevertheless, writing is the only avenue for me to release the build up pressure. I had a dream.. and its a sad dream.  You see, i fall in love with a girl i should not love. She has a bf and she loves her bf very much. Yes, you realised it too. She has a bf or don't is not an issue. The issue is, she loves her bf very much. I realised, when you fall in love with a girl you shouldn't love, you might end up with a very sad dream too. Whatever reality does not brings, your sub consciousness refuse to bring too.   The dream goes on like this..  In the dream, i dreamt of a girl, a face whom i do not know but the idea is, she is beautiful, perhaps to the eyes of the beholder. Other than the only female character in the dream, there are also 3 other guys, whose face i do not know either but seems to know them very well.   In the dream, i liked the girl a lot but i did not confess to her. In the end, she even addressed me as her brother. Knowing that she will never fall for me, i accepted her conferred title quietly. Between the 3 other guys, one of them had a serious crush on her. She noticed it and they started dating. I became a brother to her and attempt to protect her and her interests in almost every aspect. However, they had sex and he told everyone about it.   I was devastated and disappointed with the boy. However, she not only stopped me from bashing him, she also insisted that i have no rights over her matters. I could only see the both of them from far and not get involved in anything. Gradually, i left with some wishes.   If you fall in love in reality and get rejected, your dreams might not let you go either..  Hap, it has been a while for me to find myself and get myself to fall in love. The last time i fell in love, was 2 yrs ago. As time become longer for me to love somebody, i gradually know that a resistance has been formed within me to safeguard my fragile affections. 2 years ago, after broking up with my gf, i loved another girl but she is getting into her wedding grown this July.   Her husband married her because she asked him to do it. When she was sicked, her boyfriend not only wasn't worried, he even asked her to request her colleague to bring her to the doctor. When his mother bullied her, he was also quiet about it. When they meet, he only end up sleeping on her bed and wait for time to pass while she do her washings and cleaning of the house. Yet, she is willing to marry him because she wanted to settle down.  The world is weird.. so am i.. to always find trouble for myself.  Hap, thanks for listening. I seriously doesn't know when i would fall in love again after this. I hoped i don't do it anymore. Its too tiring and i rather be someone who can have sex with any women than the person i am now. I want to change.. rather be a  man who lived by lust than a man who lived by feelings.   DJ

      Listening to Yue Guang by Cyndi Wang... the only song that could smooth my tiring soul.. Spent the whole day working hard so that i can be tired and i wont think of her.  Ya, its futile, coz if i can stop thinking about her, i would write less in diary.     Probably scare her off last night when i told her in detail how i felt. She didn't understand me, so there is no way she can know if im sincere or not. Then again, even if she understands, it makes no difference because nothing would change her decision to wait for that guy who treats her like a hotel.     Some woman... i duno what to say, but really hopeless. They really seems to enjoy waiting, hoping and hopelessly in illusions, fantasy land. Although the word, "fan jian" keep appearing in my mind, i know she isn't.. She is just someone who wanted very much that the relationship will work out.. But, she didn't see beyond it. So what if she manage to salvage the relationship? Will that make any difference? She seems to believe that if the relationship didn't work out, she could move on. Base on my understandings of her, i seriously doubt she would; there is nothing i can do.     Its tiring to fall in love; more tiring to court a woman.      Nah, i will never turn gay. There is nothing in this world that will turn me away from being normal. Just waiting for the day when i get super duper tired; grab any girl and just settle down. Anyway, i just want my kids, won't ill treat her either, i'm not the sort.. but, i probably wont love her, or perhaps deep enough to put her interest before mine.      Sad?! Quite, but i want my kids and i dun want to raise them alone. :) Its too tedious and im too masculine to do that. Need a balancing force to assist me.  Ya, i wont tell her the truth also.. All these, however will only take place when im super duper tired..     How tired am i? Well... i would say im close.. probably just a step from being super duper tired.     Falling in love is like drinking a  cup of Nescafe Black Gold..  When you first smell the aroma, you felt excited..  When you had ur first slip, you felt in 9th heaven..  When you finished it, you felt great and alert..    4 hours later, you realise  you are back in the same shit as before.    *lol*. :P

      Her school started and i had taken measures to avoid her.. It occurs to me that her happiness is different from mine.. Her happiness is to be with her boyfriend, no matter how bad he treats her because he is her first boyfriend and she wants the relationship to last.. Thats different from my happiness, because my happiness to that she is to leave her boyfriend and be with me.     Although waiting seems to be suffering for her, her hopes kept her happy. In some ways, she is more blessed than me, coz' she has something to look forward to, while i have none. I can't wait because she won't turn to me. I have to go but it could be too much for me to bear. Either forward or out of the situation breaks my heart.     I am.. stuck in a  situation where all i could do is to quiet my heart and think calmly. I could only use work to bury myself as deeply as possible.. I could only think of her from far. And, i could only hear of her voice in my memories. Anything else, i can't and i shouldn't do.     Her school started, she has her friends whom she could rely upon, her work where she could bury, and her studies where her future is concern.. All i could, is to do my best to keep my distance away from her..     Painful, but there is nothing i can do to alleviate myself of the pain.. falling sick but it does not make me feel better..     1 person suffer, is better than 2 people suffer..

      Yesterday, i had a bad fall.. in the morning, it was a physical bad fall, in the evening, it was an emotional bad fall. Lets just start with the morning part..    In the morning, it was raining moderately. The road was wet and when i am reaching the office, the rain had stopped. I saw the green man from far and thought i could rush for it so i ran moderately to the junction. Not expecting any accident to take place, i sprain my ankle badly before causing my entire body to spring ahead like superman, exposing half of my body on the road. Due to the abrasion resulted from the superman activity, i made a couple of holes on my pants, wet half of my body and hurt my kneel cap. To make things worse, my laptop crashed onto me. The entire weight (mine+laptop) cause a big swell on my ankle and other parts of my body like my waist and shoulders.  I had to make an emergency call to the office to inform them of the accident, went home and change before i go to my chinese sinseh and had my painful session.    The session lasted half an hour or so and it allow me to walk slightly better and easier. Previously, i was virtually limping my way into the cab, asked my mother to come down and help me with my laptop.    My colleagues were great, they were understanding enough to help me whenever possible so that it would make my movement in the office easier. You know, even smallest things like such are not easily available in the office. I knew it coz' i had tasted very mean behaviours in my experience of work. I learnt that we shouldn't take many things for granted and a lot of things in the society are not "expected to be".    In the evening, Mandy told me her bf called from Australia and i got her meanings.. It was an emotional drawback for me, but i really appreciate that honesty. This message knocks me into sense that i can do countless of things, even the sweetest behaviour, will not be able to vie against one phone call from Australia. It even occurs to me that, even if she does have a slight change of mind towards me, i might lose her if he decides to buy her a bouquet of flowers, apologise for totally ignoring her for the past 1 year/s and wanted her to go back.  Ya, i know.. thats pathetic.. You havn't see this... the only thing she could ever say to me is, "I'm sorry. I really wish i could reciprocate..." Thats the current statistic of the situation... "SORRY". Thats the word i often hear and thats the only thing she would say when it comes to opening up of our hearts.  You bet it.. i'm totally, truthfully and sincerely heartbroken with a large amount of undescripable disillusions..    We are so much alike in thinkings.. She is very persistent and hopelessly clinging onto a relationship, where her bf takes her as a holiday gf, the kind that he wants, he comes.. he don't want, he disappear.  Like me, despite so many sorries and so many pathetic situations, i persisted and hopelessly trying to create hopes in the process. Having to write so much, i bet you already guessed my decision.. I will and shall persists even if at the end of the day, it really happened that her bf comes along with a bouquet of flowers, asking for her hand.. I shall blame nobody, and will face all consequences of my own heartache. This blog shall serves as a reminder of my clause and decision. I had already lost 1 girl who got married.. whats another? *LOL*    No, i'm not a loser because losers give up after they realise they can't have it. I don't give up and fight until my last breath.

      Last night, went to my company's function @ Centro. Things sux.. Shawn  came with his friend.  Whilst Say Kiat and Jianjie came over with  me. Liau came after everybody left. Judith was gorgeous! Ya, she always  is anyway.       Had a couple of drinks with Liau and we chatted about work and nothing  but work. Everything else seems so vague and pointless to talk about.  Both of us are disillusion with relationships. So, we decided that its  for our best, not to discuss it. If Shawn stayed longer, he would have  agree with us. For a moment, i was thinking, where is my charm?! The  next moment, i thought, since when did i have it? *LOL* Ya, i don't and  have since see the cross over from talking a lot of crap to working  things out @ work. If i had put this effort in my studies earlier, i  could have been more successful than present. But, its never too late  to realise these, thus i worked harder with knowledge and pray for  favours.       Woke up feeling a great sense of disappointment. Why? Coz' of Mandy.. I  felt that i have come to a dead end already. She continues to avoid any  issues that i have raise. I managed to work around with myself and not  indulge in relationships. In some ways, you could say that i'm becoming  more feelingless. Ya, more machine-like even though i still remember  and knows how to romance a lady. Things are very different now.  Romancing a lady used to be a passion to me.    I hate it when she apologise.. coz it made me feel worse.. Getting  rejected is worse enough for me, and if she apologise, it doesn't make  me feel better. Why? Saying sorry for rejecting me make it seems like,  sorry is the only thing she can say to me.       Its getting more and more difficult for me to feel for another person,  despite in a female working environment now. Why? I think very  differently from the rest of the people. Got to sleep... Nite, hap.

      Dear Hap,  Mandy came back from Bangkok... i was damn worried that she would lost her way and din manage to come back to Singapore, you know, she is one damn blur girl..Working @ 77th Street is super rewarding mentally.. Why?! I doubt i was this brain active everyday for the past 1 week, even if i was working previously with bigger system environment. It doesn't make sense? Well, its easier to work with computer than in an environment filled with ladies.. And because they are mostly females, i need to think before i say anything, coz' its not wise to offend female at ur workplace.. You will only end up with one pathetic end,   and probably my career will be ruined too.  I was pleased recently.. Just 1st day of work at 77th street, i was head hunted by another company to do a bank migration project, with better pay. But, since i had signed the contract with 77th street, i thought, its only the responsible part of me to stay and do what is required. On the 2nd day of work, i was head hunted again, this time, a Norway MNC that wants me to be their software consultant for some products they are selling, a MNC exposure coz im required to go regional. Again, i rejected them citing areas of responsibilities. Today, i'm head hunted again, by the software company doing 77th street's maintenance, however after some serious consideration, i thought it would be responsible of me to only accept them if they still have openings later, when i finished whats required of me @ 77th street. My mother chided me for being dumb coz all 3 companies offers me greater exposure and better pay, morever, 77th street might not appreciate what i do for them. She is right in some areas, but i thought, if i can't be responsible to my work, i will not be able to assume responsibilities in relationships and most importantly of all, to God.   You see, the weird thing about me is that, whenever i'm troubled by something, God never fail to bless me from above, and he will give me so much that spoils me with choices. I know he dotes me, yet at the same time, i felt that this is something of a test to train me to be contented with what i have because contentment is the key to happiness.   Just 1 week in the company, i had gathered and obtained information about the culture, the gossips as well as the conflicts laying around the areas. You might be wondering how i manage to find out so much? I dun know myself too, but a lot of times, when you are quiet and reserved, people tend to talk to you more and feed you with more information that you actually ask. Nope, i'm not quite a quiet person, but i find no need for me to be chatty in the office esp when this is a female working environment. If this is like what is happening in my previous job, Yes! it would be outrageously fun!   Oh well, time to go sleep. I have to work tomorrow... Oh ya, the good news of all the head hunting stuff is, the Norway MNC is keeping my CVs and resume for a readily position, should i quit 77th street and wants regional exposure, they would offer me a position immediately. I do not know true is this, coz this is certainly too good to resist it. Meanwhile, i will also do my best in the company, since this is going to be another masterpiece of my work.   I am an artist and i take pride in my system projects.   Seeya, Hap..  DJ

      You must be wondering why i didn't write anything on 7th Aug? I only write when my heart feels something.. whether happy or sad.. Indeed, 7th Aug; my birthday, i was neither happy or sad.. But i teared, because of the Korea serial i watched..  If you are wondering if i am easily influenced by movies i watched, probably.. but Summer Scent influenced me deeply.. Why do i like this one particularly? Like the two earlier episode of endless love, this do not have a very sweet ending. But, the ending is good enough, at least they can recognise one another... At least, after so many ups and downs, they are sure of their feelings.. At least, after so many things that happened, didn't change their feelings towards another.. At least, they have one another to long and loved all these years.. At this point of time, my tear fell again..  You broke up because love is no longer present.. Yet, some broke up because they love one another deeply.. So deep that breaking up is for one another's good. Despite wide distance apart, their love didn't change, didn't fade.. When it returns, it just becomes stronger..  I managed to download the entire OST because the VCD didn't come with it, unlike Winter Sonata.. also found some MTVs for the theme songs.. It makes one wonder.. if i had bought this serial the moment i saw it last year, would i feel the same now? Frankly, i had forgotten that Summer Scent is the 3rd episode.. I love it.. because the entire serial just protrayed my ideal kind of love.. just looking at the girl from far makes your heart felt glad. Yes, i could remember clearly, all these feelings.. how it felt to be in love.. to someone..  I had loved her with my life.. had become so obessesed with her.. and despite that i was eagered to break up with her, i still have very strong feelings for her. Contradicting? You will know why if you come across my path. Scent only reminds me something.. that i should never fall for somebody who is already attached...  Summer.. A little happy, a little sad.. Feeling glad and feeling loss. A little sweet and a little bitter. Thank you for bringing love into my life.  Lovers shouldn't apologise..  DJ

      Bought Summer Scent, the korean serial, 3rd series of the 4 season love story. .  Theme in the drama,  Scent of the flower Rain Memories  Summer scent brought my heart back to me, like how it brings life to the girl in the show who had a weak heart. By the 3rd episode, i had shed tears several times, faster than Winter Sonata. One would wonder, how touching can Summer be?  Summer, often gives me an idea that it is hot, like the habitat of Singapore year round. However,  Summer can also make one felt bewildered. The season itself brings hope, added colours to the environment, at the same time, it shakes one's belief because this is the time when everything around us seems undoubtfully beautiful.  Man, rules by visual and sound waves.  Combining both factor, the director brings to us, another touching story of Love. I did not look forward to it, or rather, i hope i never find it. Falling in love with somebody whose heart stays with another, is unwise.   Forgetting you, though is not an option, but the only option if I want you to be happy. Remembering you, though is a wonderful thing, but the act itself brings agony. Hearing you, though is inappropriate, but reminds me that days and nights spent on getting over you is futile. Time, alone, is useless if my unconscious mind never want to remove you from my heart.  I could only draws a border to prevent myself from crossing over...
