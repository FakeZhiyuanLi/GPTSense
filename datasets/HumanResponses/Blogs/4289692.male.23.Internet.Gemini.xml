       [Note: I will be editing this throughout the day.]  It's a lot of work to cook dinner / make lunch with actual food and not, you know, prepackaged crap.  Weigh-in: Forgot to check.  Breakfast: 8oz yogurt (with vanilla/cinnamon/splenda, per south beach recipe) 1 slice of ham 1 5.5oz can of Campbells tomato juice  Exciting, no?

       The wife and I are working off of southbeachdiet.com. At first, this seemed like a good idea because it provides meal planning. Turns out, this is a bad idea. We made an earnest attempt at hunting down all of the various ingredients, but really this just demonstrated our staple food items at the house were lacking. We wound up spending a small fortune just to build up on spices and condiments. Next week I imagine we'll be paying more attention to how to tailor the stuff to better fit our grocery budget.  Anyway, on with the day.  Weigh-in: 331.6lbs  Breakfast: 8oz yogurt (with vanilla/cinnamon/splenda, per south beach recipe) 1 slice of ham 1 5.5oz can of Campbells tomato juice  This is actually more food than I am used to eating in the morning, and I expect it will take me awhile to get used to eating a real breakfast. Lunch is looking to be a lot of food too, although we did make larger salads than their recipe called for by adding more lettuce. The basic lunch salads are kind of small across the board in their recipes.  10am Snack: 2x Turkey w/ lettuce/red pepper/cliantro maynonaise, per south beach recipe  These are better than I expected them to be. They seem like a lot of work, but after doing it once, I can't imagine it would take long to repeat the process.  Lunch: A medium-sized turkey and ham chef salad with oil and vinegar dressing.  The salad was good, mostly because of the dressing. Instead of using just balsamic vinegar and oil, I used a mixture of things I've used before to help cut down on the bitter taste of balsamic vinegar. I have to pre-mix dressing so I can take it to work, so.. Recipe below (I'm not good at naming these things either):  Balsamic, Merlot &amp; Olive Oil Dressing: 1/3rd extra virgin olive oil 2/3rds vinegar, broken down into about: 90% Merlot vinegar 10% balsamic vinegar  I don't really like the taste of the Merlot or balsamic vinegars by themselves, but together they kind of level out at palatable.  3pm Snack: 2x Turkey w/ lettuce/red pepper/cliantro maynonaise, per south beach recipe  Dinner: Sauteed Chicken Breast Green Beans Cauliflower processed into potato-like-substance (don't ask me, it was part of the diet)  Desert: Sugar Free Jello w/ Coop Whip Lite (yum?)  That's all for today.

       Okay. It occurs to me that this is a bad idea. I'm taking a break at work, and have decided I'm going to start a blog to cover the diet my wife wants me on.  The reasoning in this is simple: I'm a  urlLink fat bastard , and while this doesn't really bother me, other people, like my wife, keep being concerned about my impending heart attack enough to where I've decided that if she will actually commit to it, I might as well too. See, starting a blog to cover the topic doesn't really change much -- I'm already walking around in public, and people are looking at me. All this does is open the floodgate of comments that people wouldn't say in public because they're too chickenshit (take that, would be trolls). :)  So, for the basics.  I'm about 6'1". I weigh 330 lbs, or so. I am slightly over  100lbs  overweight. If I can get down to 275, I'll be happy enough. More and I'm asking for a lot, I'd figure, but I'm going to try.  So the method of attack is going to be similar to the way my coworker is losing weight, mostly because it's obvious it works with some dedication. His program is basically a South Beach diet with lots of exercise. Like 2 hours a day of exercise. I'm not sure if I can handle that, mostly because I have a 1 1/2 hour commute to work every day, but I'm going to give it a shot. When he sees this blog, I'm positive I will get shit for it. :)  Anyway, I've opened up comments on this blog. My e-mail address is  urlLink windex@windex.org , just in case you have the need to insult me privately instead of in a public forum where you may be able to impress chicks (yeah, right).   UPDATE : Above mentioned co-worker has noted to me that he actually only exercises 1 hour a day. That seems much easier to hit than 2. :)
