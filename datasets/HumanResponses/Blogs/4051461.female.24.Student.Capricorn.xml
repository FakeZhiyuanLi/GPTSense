      Now as we all know sleepy time in Shenty-ville can sometimes be a dramatic and interesting event.  Not that I ever go to bed at an even close to reasonable hour, but when I do finally crash...it's pretty fuckin wierd.  Besides the flailing and wandering about...I have the craziest dreams EVER.  Sometimes I even think they're real.  This can be fairly cool...if I have a good dream...but Murphy's law insists that the only time my dreams are vivid and confused with real life events is when they are either horrificly violent, retardedly scary, or just messed up.  Sometimes the messed up ones can be kind of fun...but usually just a bit of a pain in the ass.  But either way it usally takes me awhile to decifer when something didn't actually occur and was just my subconscious being trixie.  So...a friendly warning...if I ever start rambling nonsense or accuse you of performing outrageous acts...remember...narco meds are not 100% effective!

      In the words of a broken heart  it's just emotion taking me over  Caught up in sorrow  lost in the song  but if you don't come back  Come home to me, darling  don't you know there's nobody left in this world to hold me tight  nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight  Goodnight, goodnight   -Destiny's Child

      Why are some people so stupid?&nbsp; When I say "people" I specifically mean female people...myself included.&nbsp; It's like...people can take advantage of you, stomp on you, treat you like shit, rip your heart out, and so on...and we'll just keep coming back for more as if they were handing out cookies.&nbsp; "Maybe if I pout or cry they'll feel sorry for me and stop it..."&nbsp; Admittedly this thought has crossed my mind.&nbsp; You'd think by now I...and all the other girls like me...would get it.&nbsp; If someone is going to be wreckless with your feelings...they aren't going to care if it makes you cry.&nbsp; If they were going to care...they wouldn't have hurt you in the first place.   I think sometimes it's like a challenge or something.&nbsp; "I am going to make this person love me if it kills me!"&nbsp; Maybe it's like the dejected feeling you get when feelings, although verbally reinforced, aren't reciprocated in the actions of others.&nbsp; But get real, is it worth it?&nbsp; Why do you care what this one person thinks?   The worst part for me...I can acknowledge the dangerous habits...but have no idea how to stop it.

      I suppose this may not be the most appropriate forum for this.&nbsp; Or maybe it is.&nbsp; I'm generally too much of a pussy to launch substantive authentic apologies to those who deserve them.&nbsp; Not because I can't admit I'm wrong, but because&nbsp;I often don't recognize my own insolence.&nbsp; And&nbsp;by the time I do...it's generally too late.&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying that...I'd like to apologize.&nbsp; The following crimes&nbsp;perpetrated at one time or another...the victims....you know who you are.  I'm sorry for:   being reckless with your heart.&nbsp; I was young.&nbsp; Not that that is an excuse...but I truly didn't understand the impact of my actions.&nbsp; I had never had a&nbsp;broken heart...and truly didn't believe I was capable of producing one in someone else.  &nbsp;letting you get away with so much.&nbsp; I had an opportunity to gently teach you ways to treat other human beings.&nbsp; Instead...I walked.&nbsp; I took the easy way out...and you never knew.  dragging you down with me.&nbsp; Misery loves company right?  being so damn ungrateful.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I'm the bigget spoiled brat to ever walk the earth.&nbsp; Just so you know...deep down...I truly appreciate everything you have done for me...and probably will do for me in the future.&nbsp; I probably don't deserve it...but either way...I appreciate it.&nbsp; And I know I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for your continued support.&nbsp; You're my angels.&nbsp; Thank you.  making you believe you are worth less than you are.&nbsp; I have no right to pass judgements on anyone.&nbsp; Peoples differences are what make them unique...I am still learning to embrace that.  pushing you away.&nbsp; Sometimes it's hard to accept help.   &nbsp;

      Does it ever strike you as strange that when you are wallowing in the depths of loneliness, like extreme loneliness, the kind that actually makes your heart hurt, that the one thing that would make you feel at least slightly less suicidal is a friend...but who feels like having someone around when you're that disconsolate?&nbsp; A complete catch-22.&nbsp; But I guess that's the viscious self-perpetuating circle.&nbsp;   The other thing that's strange is how people who claim that you can talk to them and are your friends seem to disappear at warp speed as soon as you actually need them for a purpose other than mindless entertainment or lustful satisfaction.&nbsp; You can really discover who TRUE FRIENDS are in these times.&nbsp; You also can discover just how few true friends you have.&nbsp; But the ones you do have....are like angels sent to save you.&nbsp; Save you from what?&nbsp; I'm not too sure...probably yourself.&nbsp; At least in my case anyway.

      The glove compartment is inaccurately named,  and everybody knows it,  so i'm proposing a swift orderly change.  Cause behind its door there's nothing to keep my fingers warm.  And all I find are souvenirs from better times,  before the gleam of your tail lights fading east...to find...yourself a better life.   there's no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all and here i rest where disappointment and regret collide...lying awake at night   -Deathcab for Cutie

      Lets have a little chat about "selling-out" shall we.  Funny fact:  people, practically all people, are quite vocal about their disdain for those who do not show up to events that they say they will attend.  Funnier fact: I have yet to meet someone who hasn't sold out at some time or another.  I'm sure I'm not completely innocent myself, but I make a valid effort to NOT commit to something unless I'm 110% sure I will follow through.  Those who know me well will agree that I hand out "maybe's" to invites like it's going out of style...this is generally in response to invites that don't hinder on my presence.  For instance, if two people have asured plans with each other exclusively then it is quite imperative that both parties make every effort to either show up or give the other party due notice that they will not be able to make it.  If this doesn't happen one party will end up screwed sitting alone in their apartment watching re-runs of Cheers and throwing popcorn at the tv everytime they hear the crowd shout "NORM!"  Maybe it's Victoria, maybe it's the people I know, maybe it's me....but for some reason this seems to happen to me more times than not.  I like to think that I'm a fairly decent person...I'm not a complete ass to hang out with...so I'm assuming this happens to lots of other people too.  So...a little advice....if you have plans with someone, don't just not call, or call at 10pm on Saturday night to cancel....it's not fair.  And you may not realize how hard the other person may take this.  Your reason for cancelling, be it other plans, illness, a good porno sight, whatever, has no bearing on the fact that you just screwed someone over and made them feel like shit.  If for some reason you do ditch out on someone....perhaps you may consider calling with a sincere apology and plans to make it up (which you really really should make an effort to keep unless you want to come off as a complete ditch-pig).  It doesn't matter if you ditched them and made no effort at the time to enlighten the other person as to your failure to follow through you should still call...even a week later....to let the person know you acted like an ass, and you know you acted like an ass, and the fact that you are an ass is why you didn't show up....not because there is something wrong with that other person.   Sorry if this sounds bitter...but...."do unto others...."  right?
