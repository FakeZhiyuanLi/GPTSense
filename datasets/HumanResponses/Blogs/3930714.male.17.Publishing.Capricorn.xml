						    Installment II:   The Battle Against the Boredasaurus   It was a clear and partly-cloudy early afternoon when Baron von Zach awoke from a dreamless sleep with a stop. He had been having a new recurring dream about pie, just plain pie, and was upset because he didn’t find out how it ended. He slowly blinked his sleepiness away and tried to stretch his arms, but found his legs in shackles. This startled him so much that he found himself unable to stretch his arms, which he then realized were in shackles. He looked around and found himself in a jail cell, its walls covered in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles wallpaper.  “What is the meaning of this?” the Baron asked out-loud in his head as a guard passed by him.  “You have displeased the Boredasaurus!” screamed the guard. “Thus, we have shackled you and your friend! Hah! HAIL BOREDASAURUS!”  “My God, you can read minds?” questioned the Baron, taken afront by the way the guard seemed to read his minds.  “What?” asked the guard turning towards the Baron. “Oh, no, I’m talking to my mother on my super-cool Nokia cell phone!” The guard proceeded to hold up the cell phone to the camera (in your mind, duh), wink, give a thumbs-up, and smile. “But yeah, I guess that thing that I said applies to you, too.”  “Well then where is my faithful but horribly inept squire Markus the Great?” asked the Baron removing one of his hands from its shackle to point at the guard. He suddenly realized that all of his shackles were much too big, so he removed all of his limbs from them.  “HEY, GET BACK IN YOUR SHACKLES!” yelled the guard, pointing his sword at the Baron. “I’LL SHOOT!”  “You fool,” scoffed the Baron, “that’s a sword, not a handgun…whatever a handgun is.”  Much to the Baron’s dismay, the sword actually wasn’t a sword, but a handgun, even though those hadn’t been invented at the time…so I guess it really was a sword, but one that shot bullets. An ear-splitting boom echoed from the barrel of the sword as its wielder pulled the trigger, proceeding to split its owner’s ears, which were, incidentally, not those of the wielder. As a bullet hurtled towards the Baron, seemingly in slow motion, he deftly jumped, spun in the air, and dodged it. He then deftly smashed his head against a wall.  “It appears that I have been injured,” said the Baron, lying on the ground, holding his head. “Oh yes - ouch. But I have no time for pain! I must find my faithful but horribly inept squire Markus the Great!”  “The Baron quickly leapt from the ground and bolted out of his jail cell, which was conveniently unlocked,” said a guard, narrating the story, but otherwise not paying attention to what was going on. The Baron then beat the guard’s head in with a conveniently-placed metal cantaloupe…known to some as a cannonball. Baron von Zach then proceeded to kill all the other guards in the jail with the spherical ball, screaming epithets such as, “REMEMBER THE ALAMO!” and, “EVERYONE KNOWS THAT HONEYDEW IS THE MONEY MELON!” (and, of course, it is).  “Foo’, you best quit bustin’ skulls and let me outta this jail cell!” screamed Markus at the Baron from a nearby indoor pool.  “Markus, I thought you were dead!” said the jubilant Baron as he tried to find the keys for the pool on a dead guard. "Wait a second - Markus, you're in a pool. Do you realize that?"  "Yeah, man, but it's a  jail  pool - don't you know nothin'?" asked Markus as he pointed to a lock randomly placed at the other end of the pool.  "MARKUS!" yelled the Baron in an attempt to sound like an old black woman, not that I'm illustrating a stereotype by implying that old black women sound a certain way, but I am, and they all sound like this. "GET OUT THE DAMN POOL 'FORE I TAKE A SWITCH TO YA!"  "Yessum," said Markus in a dejected way as he put his piña colada in the cup holder of his floating chair and climbed out of the pool, er, jail.  "Now, Markus, have you managed to find out anything about this alleged, quote-unquote,  Boredasaurus ?" asked the Baron, making quotation marks in the air with his fingers after every syllable for the greatest redundancy possible, and continuing long after he had finished speaking.  "I am pleased to report that I have found out jack shit, sir," said Markus clicking the heels of his John Kerrys, I mean, flip-flops together and giving a stupid-looking salute.  "And who is this Jack Shit character, Markus?" queried the Baron, removing his sunglasses (that the narrator will not explain the origin of...yet!) and chewing on them in an attempt to look insightful...or maybe intelligent - who knows.  "Figure of speech there, man," said Markus, rolling his eyes. "And why the hell are you chewing on your sunglasses?"  "They're quite good - would you like to try them?" queried the Baron, offering Markus his glasses.  "No, no, I think my day has been queered up enough, thanks," said Markus, in an attempt to illustrate the author's ability to make terrible puns.  "Suit yourself," replied an unfazed Baron von Zach as Markus began to tailor himself a suit. "Oh my God, what is that?!"  "That's a door...why?" asked an obviously confused Markus.  "Because it might just be our ticket out of this hell hole!" exclaimed the Baron to Markus as a woman carrying a plate of appetizers passed by them, and a steel drum began to play in the background as a cool tropical breeze blew through the surrounding palm trees.  "Uh, I think  that  would be our ticket out of here," said Markus, pointing to a door marked: "Exit."  "No, no," corrected the Baron, "they just want us to think that that is the exit. This door is the real exit."  The Baron proceeded to open the door he had found labeled: "Do not enter under pain of death," and Markus followed, being an idiot (though for legal reasons I must say that he was not as big of an idiot as the Baron...at that time).  As the two adventurers walked through the doorway, a mighty scream was let out...to rampage among the townsfolk of a nearby city, but that's another story. Oh, and another scream was let out by a mighty, uh,  thing  that now stood in front of Markus and the Baron.  "Jesus H. Sam Hill!" yelled Markus, invoking the name of a strange deity. "What the shit is that?"  "That, my friend, would be the Boredasaurus," said the Baron matter-of-factly.  "Then why isn't the narrator describing the damn thing?" asked Markus, perplexed.  "Well," said the Baron, beginning to explain, "I believe it's because the narrator is hoping that by maintaining an air of mystery around the strange creature, he'll be able to hold the reader's interest just enough to direct his or her attention away from the paper-thin plot, and shoddy job of character development in this otherwise random misadventure."  "Ah, but through my analysis, I have come to the simple and erroneous conclusion that he is being controlled by the Boredasaurus, which is telling him what to say," said Markus, voicing one of his moronic opinions that make no sense and have no factual basis.  In any case, they were both correct, but for the fact that Markus's conclusion was erroneous and completely untrue.  As the thin veil of redundancy cleared the room, the Boredasaurus came into plain sight, its mighty, or small (I haven't decided) frame towering, or cowering, over (or under) Markus and Baron von Zach.  "Would he make up his cracker-ass mind?" asked Markus to no one in particular.  The  towering  beast suddenly shot a great fireball of ice at Markus and the Baron, who were forced to dive out of the way, or in Markus's case stumble out of the way like a complete oaf. The two now stood at opposite ends of the room, shielding themselves behind great stone pillars as the Boredasaurus lobbed rocks at them, even though it had the ability to shoot fireballs of ice and other such contradictory projectiles.  "Hey!" screamed Markus over the din of rocks crashing around him and the Baron. "I was thinking about how we could defeat this thing, and ---"  "Really?" interrupted the Baron. "I was thinking about why the Boredasaurus would put the jail right next to its lair. I mean come on, that's like James Bond villain stupid - not that I know who that is. Anyway, continue."  "AS I WAS SAYING," yelled Markus, obviously annoyed, "I think that this monster causes boredom, as is implied by the name Boredasaurus."  "And I think that you're wrong," said the Baron, sitting on the ground, twiddling his thumbs, and counting floor tiles.  "Okay, well, you being an idiot aside," said Markus, shooting a hard glare at the Baron, who took it in the chest, but managed to stay on his feet due to his stare-proof vest (hey, unintentional poetry), " I think to survive we need to do something exciting, like play...foosball. Once it sees us having fun, I'm guessing it will weaken, giving us an opportunity to either run away or kill it."  "Markus," said the Baron, "that is a well-thought-out, intelligent, and completely appropriate response to the situation." Upon hearing this, Markus smiled, but his smile slowly faded as the Baron continued. "But I just can't get past the fact that the Boredasaurus put the jail next to its secret lair, the location of which was publicly disclosed last October. I mean my God, it might as well have installed a 'Kill the Boredasaurus' button or something."  Just then, the Baron noticed a big, red button on the ground labeled: "Kill the Boredasaurus."  "Well fuck me," said Markus as the censors gasped.  "That's some crazy snap shizzle!" exclaimed the Baron as the gangster rappers gasped.  "GOD DAMNIT, I TOLD YOU NEVER TO SAY THAT!" yelled Markus, charging at the Baron.  Thinking quickly, the Baron pressed Markus and kicked the button in the shin. When that didn't work, he tried the opposite. Markus fell to the ground, screaming in pain and clutching his shin, and the Boredasaurus fell to the ground with a mighty Boredasaurus noise. It lay there bleeding as Markus continued to yell, now cursing the Baron and trying to kick him with his good leg.  "Well, I guess the endses justify the meanses, bossa man," said the Baron with a chuckle...or was it a guffaw...as he dragged his faithful, but horribly inept, squire through a door labeled: "You idiot - not this door, the other one."  UNTIL NEXT TIME...

						    Installment I:   La Batalla Contra Señor Cracker    It was a dark and stormy mid-morning when the illustrious Baron von Zach heard a knock at the door of his not-so-awesome castle.  The castle was a bit old, a good bit disheveled, a great bit run-down, and a greater bit awful.   "HUMPHREY!" screamed the Baron at his servant, hinting that he should get the door.   No answer from Humphrey came.   "HUMPHREY!" the Baron yelled again.   Again, silence was the only response.  The door knocked again.   "Oh, I suppose I shall get it myself," said the Baron as he stood up from his chair and walked to the door.  As he unbolted the heavy screen door and swung it open, the Baron was taken aback by what he saw, even though he could see it already because it was a screen door, and you can see through those, but you know, sometimes it's hard to see through those things because they get bugs stuck in them and...ANYWAY, at the door was his old friend Markus the Great.   "Hey, honky!" yelled Markus as he stuck up his hand to give the Baron a high-five.   "What's crackin', beefaroni?!" yelled Zach back (oh the poetry) as he gave Markus a high-five.  The high five was followed by a deafening boom, and an even more deafening, "GOD DAMNIT, ZACH!" as Markus's hand began to throb and turn red.   "Wait, what the hell?  Beefaroni?" queried Markus.   "I don't know, I couldn't think of anything to say - you know I'm not good at 'ghetto-talk,'" responded the illustrious Baron in an illustrious manner, with much illustration.  "So why are you here?"   "Well, I'm here because I need your help, man.  You remember that dude Señor Cracker?" inquired Markus with much inquisition.   "You mean that guy that used to teach us Spanish, but then turned into a blue dragon and started killin' people?" inquired Zach back (again, I'm awesome with the poetry) in a far less inquisitorial fashion.   "No, the other one that turned into a  red  dragon and started killin' people," replied Mark with much replication.   "Oh, gotcha," said the Baron.  "What about him?"   "Well, you remember that maze I built him that was supposed to keep him imprisoned for all of eternity?" Markus asked with undue vehemence.   "Yes, I do remember.  Wait, why did you build a maze, anyway?  Wouldn't it have been easier to just build a big jail or something?  I mean, you can get out of a maze, but jails are much harder to escape from.  And wait, what the hell, dragons can fly out of mazes, you moron.  Maybe a nice dungeon..." the Baron was cut off (no, not literally...well, yes literally, but not LITERALLY literally).   "Shut yo' cracker-ass mouth!" screamed Markus with due vehemence.  "I'll build a maze if I want to!  But seriously now, the dude escaped from the maze and now I need you to help me go kill 'im."   "Oh snap shizzle!" exclaimed the Baron.   "Hey, that's my line, douchebag!" exclaimed Markus.   "Oh, sorry!" exclaimed the Baron.   "That's alright, man!" exclaimed Markus.  "But seriously now, get your armor and stuff; we need to go adventurin' and kill us some dragons."   "Your lacking of proper grammar is unpleasing to I, Markus," said the Baron with pompousness, dissimilitude, and beviloquence.   There was a great pause, and for no real reason the two men stared at each other with great flames burning in their eyes, wishing each other ill, until they realized that their eyes were on fire and they both felt sick.  They both perforce proceeded to jump in the moat.  When the fires were out, Baron von Zach was the first to speak as the two clambered out of the foul water.   "Alright, man, I'll help you with your dragon problems, but only if you'll be my squire."   "W-what?!" stammered Markus in a stammering way.  "I ain't bein' yo' squire, cracker!"   "I'll give you fifty dollars," said the Baron, holding up the money.   "Sold!" said Markus, grabbing the cash.  He then proceeded to throw the money on the ground and roll around in it.   "You do realize that I just gave you Monopoly money, don't you?" asked the Baron.   "What?!  Oh hell no!  I ain't bein' no sort o' squire now, honky!" retorted Markus even though the two weren't arguing yet.   "Too late," said Zach matter-of-factly.  "You already agreed to it, so you're my squire.  Hah, hah, hah."   "Aww, shit," said Markus, dropping to the ground.   "I know, I know, it's some crazy snap shizzle," the Baron said in an attempt to pacify the obviously upset Markus.   "I TOLD YOU, THAT'S MY LINE, DAMNIT!" Markus yelled as he shot up from the ground and attempted to strangle Baron von Zach.  Markus's attempts to kill his master were thwarted, however, by a well-placed high-five that knocked Markus unconscious for ten days...no, make that two hours.   As Markus lay unconscious, the Baron went and watched  The Last Starfighter .  When that was over, he went and put his armor on and assembled his weapons (they were in pieces).  When Markus awoke, the Baron helped him to his feet and then knocked him over again, doing this repeatedly until he grew weary.   "Alright, let's get going, Markus," said the Baron to his now conscious squire.   "A'aight, let's get the horses then," said Markus, moving towards Baron von Zach's stable.   "Uh, yeah, about the horses..." said Baron von Zach, staring down at the ground and shuffling his feet in an awkward manner.   "What did you do with the horses?" inquired an exasperated Markus with much exasperation and a hint of dissimilitude mixed with chartreuseness.   The Baron did not say anything, but merely held up a jar of paste.   "That's some crazy..."  Before Markus could finish his sentence, he stopped talking.  The two warriors (for those of you not paying attention, that would be Baron von Zach and Markus the Great) stared upwards at a great figure hovering underhead...I mean, overhead.  The two recognized the great flying thing as Señor Cracker - the dragon that they were about to set out to kill.   "THAT'S SOME CRAZY SNAP SHIZZLE!" exclaimed the Baron, drawing his sword on a sheet of notebook paper.   "For the last time - my line!" yelled Markus.  "And quit drawing your sword!  Draw your sword!"  "Oh yeah," said the Baron, drawing his sword and turning to face the dragon.  "DRAGON!  I am the illustrious Baron von Zach, and this is my horribly inept, but very faithful squire, Markus the Great!"   "Horribly in-whatnow?" asked a perplexed and slightly angry Markus.   "Quiet, squire," said the Baron to Markus.  "Dragon, we have come here...we have stayed here to slay you!  Prepare to be slayed!"   "Slain," corrected Markus.   "What?" asked the Baron, turning to face his squire.   "'Prepare to be  slain ,' not, 'prepare to be  slayed .'" corrected Markus again.  "...Asshole."   The Baron turned to face the dragon again.  "Please forgave my squire, you who is about to be slayed - he knows very few English.  I'm the one which speaks English good.  Now die!"   As the word "die" left the Baron's mouth, it hit the dragon in the face and caused it to fall down and hit its head.  The two warriors then charged the prone dragon, screaming at the top of their lungs for no reason at all.  When they finally reached the dragon which was ten feet away, they began to stab it with their steely knives but they just couldn't kill the beast!  The Eagles then appeared from nowhere, and an awesome guitar solo began.  The Baron began to rock out with the Eagles, grabbing an air guitar and playing it with his teeth.  Markus just stared and shook his head.  When the band got to the chorus, they magically disappeared, leaving the Baron looking like a moron singing, "Welcome to the hotel California!" over and over again because he seemed to have forgotten the lyrics.   "Oh, yeah, dragon," said the Baron, realizing that the song was over and there was a dragon to kill.   The Baron and Markus tried over and over to kill the dragon, but to no avail; its hide was thick as construction paper, and their weapons were as dull as Fiskars safety scissors.   "Wait a second!" ejaculated Markus. "I've got it!"   Markus quickly reached his hand into his pocket...Wow, combined with that last bit of dialogue, that sounds really wrong...but anyway...and pulled out a croissant.  The croissant was glowing, and emitted a strange, high-pitched noise.  Markus laid the croissant in front of the dragon's head, and immediately the dragon woke up.  It eyed the croissant greedily, until Baron von Zach decapitated it.   "Oh,  that's  why it wouldn't die," said Zach in a moment of epiphany.   "Why's that, kill-stealer?" questioned Markus.   "Why's what?" asked Zach back (I'm not going to stop with that).  "Oh, that - uh, I forget."   "Well come on, let's get the hell out of here!" ejaculated Markus, sheathing his sword.   "What's the rush?" queried the Baron.   "We got more adventurin' to do!" responded Markus, flapping his arms like a caribou...er, duck...for no good reason.   "That's some crazy snap shizzle!" exclaimed the Baron.   Markus proceeded to knock the Baron unconscious with a stupid book that he carried around about rats with knives or something stupid like that.  The title of the book shall remain a mystery, mostly because I couldn't see the cover.   "Now  that's  some crazy..." Markus was about to finish, but the Baron stood up and knocked him out with a rock, and then fell unconscious again.   UNTIL NEXT TIME...

						     Installment IV:   Bungle in the Bronx   It was a dark and stormy night in the land of clichés when Markus the Great collapsed, exhausted, fatigued, and just plain tired, into a pile of redundancy. He had been running at a walking pace for hours on end, and had long since forgotten why he was doing so.  Suddenly, far in the distance, a scream erupted from a man's mouth, spilling hot lava all over him, killing him instantly. Then, behind the man, came a blood-curdling scream so blood-curdling that it could reduce a man's cholesterol fifty points.  "And that makes sense how?" asked Markus to the narrator as a giant hand came down from the heavens and slapped him across the face. "Fine, I wont' ask questions."  Markus, clutching his face, knew the scream he just heard was the scream of none other than Baron von Zach. Either that or it was someone else's. Nevertheless, Markus set off in search of the man who had screamed.  Meanwhile, far away, yet very near as well somehow, Baron von Zach was struggling through the brambles of the Forest of Uncertainty. He had a cool head and a very good idea about where he was going.  "Why the hell is this forest called the Forest of Uncertainty?" asked the Baron with great confidence in his voice.  Suddenly, a small, round hole opened up in the ground mere feet from where the Baron was standing. A tiny old man, no larger than six feet tall, clambered out of the hole with surprising speed. The man answered the Baron's question in a terrible British accent that was surprisingly genuine, but sounded completely ridiculous.  "Because it makes you uncertain, it do!"  "Your terrible British accent that is surprisingly genuine, but sounds completely ridiculous, makes me want to give credence to what you say," said the Baron to the old man. "After all, you are British, so that automatically makes you intelligent."  "Skip-skip-trillio then, ya damn yank!" said the old Brit as he hobbled away with the grace of an Olympic marathon runner spliced with a malfunctioning ice crusher.  "What a nice old bastard," said the Baron to himself as he began his trek through the forest once again.  A pair of eyes watched the Baron from a nearby bush (hint for the idiots: they're the same eyes from last time), but he did not notice them, nor did he notice the cliffhanger.

						    Installment III:   Da Battle Againzt da Artizt Formerly Known as Ridikulous     It was a foggy late evening when Baron von Zach stopped his trek through a marshy swamp. The Baron had been trudging through the murky, muddy, but otherwise crystal-clear water for over an hour, dragging his faithful squire behind him by the leg. The Baron pulled up a nearby rock and laid Markus's leg down. He then realized that he had been dragging his squire, face-down, through the mud.  "Christ crodgers," said the Baron, making up a word as he lifted his squire's head out of the mud.  The Baron, remembering his lifeguard training, or forgetting, rather, quickly began to perform the Heimenstein maneuver on Markus, repeatedly punching him in the face and screaming, "Hey, you, get your damn hands off her!"  Suddenly, Michael J. Fox appeared out of the swamp and handed the Baron some legal papers for quoting  Back to the Future . The Baron tore them up, spat in his face, cursed him for being Canadian, began to chant, "Sooner dead than red!" and then got lost in his dreamboat eyes. I mean, no, that didn't happen.  After that didn't happen, the Baron resumed punching Markus in the face and randomly quoting movies, until he stopped. He began again after he started, until he finally realized that it was no use - Markus was dead.  "KHAAAAN!" screamed the Baron as he cradled his dead squire's head in his hands. "STELLAAAA! ADRIAAAAN!"  Unfortunately, no invocation of any character would bring Markus back now, except for that other woman from  A Streetcar Named Desire . The Baron didn't think of that, though, so Markus stayed dead.  Just then, an old Jewish man approached the Baron yelling, "He's only half-dead!" The man's wife quickly came and took him away, and all references to  The Princess Bride  have hereby ended.  "I think that I might be able to help you in your little dilemma," said an extremely strange yet horribly familiar voice (the horrible familiarity of which shall never be explained) behind the Baron.  "Who said that in an extremely strange yet horribly familiar manner, the horrible familiarity of which shall never be explained?" asked the Baron.  "I did!" yelled the voice.  Suddenly, a plume of smoke erupted from the swamp, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the story. Out of the swamp then emerged a great and terrible figure that was emitting a terrible cackle. It was clad in all black, but for the pink robe it wore, the purple hat that sat atop its head, and the yellow pants it had tied around its neck for one reason or another. The figure held a great scepter that glowed whatever color scepters glow, and around its neck it wore a great Cadillac medallion, even though cars hadn't been invented yet.  "Hahahahahaha!" cackled the figure, though not as terribly as before. "So, you want your little squire back, do you? Well, I think that I can be of service!"  As the word "service" left the mouth of the strange figure, the Cadillac medallion around its neck began to glow the same color as its scepter, and amazingly, Markus began to lift off of the ground. The figure then yelled in a booming voice, "BLANCH DUBOIS!"  "Damnit!" exclaimed the Baron. "That was it, not Stella. I'm a moron."  "No shit, Sherlock," said a now alive, but badly bruised Markus.  "Markus!" said the jovial Baron. "You're alive! And thus you are not dead! I am perforce enthused by this superb resurrection!"  "Well, now I believe that we must be discussing the means of my payment," said the strange figure to the Baron who was attempting to build a lean-to out of mud. "Ahem...AHEM."  "What?" said an obviously-annoyed Baron. "Can't you see that I'm building a shelter?"  "Dude, you didn't pay attention in Boy Scouts, did you?" asked Markus of the Baron.  "I paid plenty of attention in Boy Scouts," scoffed the Baron as he lifted his nose to Markus in a holier-than-thou, sanctimonious, supercilious, and completely redundant fashion. "Let me demonstrate - leaves of three...I'll eat thee. Leaves of four...you're a whore."  The Baron immediately picked up a poison ivy plant and ate it. He then threw a four-leaved plant at Markus and began singing "Roxanne" by the Police.  Upon hearing "Roxanne," the strange figure...God, I'm tired of calling it that...cringed and let out a shriek. "SING NOT THAT SONG! I AM THE ARTIST FORMERLY KNOWN AS RIDIKULOUS, AND I DEMAND AN END TO CLASSIC ROCK!"  The Baron gasped.  "Wait," said the Baron, "what is so great about the name Ridiculous?"  "Well, it's spelled incorrectly," responded the artist formerly known as Ridikulous. "Here, look at the narration."  "So it is," said the Baron as he read the account of what had just happened. "Well, now that that's settled, I'm afraid I'm going to have to kill you, Ridikulous...I mean, the artist formerly known as Ridikulous. You know, that reminds me - after I saw the movie 'The Chronicles of Riddick,' even though movies haven't been invented yet, I jumped up and said, 'That was RIDICULOUS!' Get it, guys? Huh?"  Markus and the artist formerly known as Ridikulous stared at the Baron for a long, long time before the dialogue began again.  "SILENCE, FOOLISH MORTAL!" screamed (the artist formerly known as Ridikulous is getting really hard to type, so his name is going to be Stan now) Stan. "I AM STAN, AND I WILL PUT AN END TO YOUR CLASSIC ROCK NONSENSE! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!"  "God, could you be any less creative with the 'MUHAHAHAHAHAHA'ing?" asked the Baron in an attempt to be a smartass.  "QUIET!" yelled Stan as he shot out a beam of light from his Cadillac emblem at Markus and the Baron.  The two adventurers dodged the beam of light and hid behind two trees. Realizing that he had already described a situation much like this before, the narrator lashed himself twenty times for being uncreative.  "HEY!" exclaimed Markus to the Baron.  "What, Markus?" questioned the Baron. "Were you just going to voice another one of your idiotic plans for killing the bad guy that never work like you always do?"  "No, I just realized that I haven't had much dialogue in this installment, and so did the narrator," said Markus.  "Gotcha," said the Baron who was hoping that Markus would actually voice one of those idiotic ideas because he had no idea how to kill Stan.  A voice suddenly appeared from nowhere, and by nowhere I mean from behind a tree.  "Helloooo," said the voice.  "Oh my God!" exclaimed the Baron. "It's the ghost of Christmas past!"  "Noooo, it really issssnnnnn'tttt," said the voice again.  "Christmas present?" asked the Baron.  "Man, you're no fun - it's Alex Neiman," said...Alex Neiman.  "You're the ghost of Christmas present?" queried the Baron.  "Quit being a dumbass," said Alex. "Take this guitar and go play some music from the nineteen-eighties, and you're sure to kill Stan. Alright, bye."  Alex suddenly disappeared with the song "Eye of the Tiger" playing in the distance.  "Now what did she tell me to do with this guitar?" asked the Baron.  "She told you to play eighties music, shithead," said Markus.  "I DIDN'T ASK YOU," yelled the Baron as he slung the guitar over his shoulder, realized it didn't have a strap, and then picked it up out of the mud.  The Baron gamboled...no...he sauntered over to Stan, poised in the guitar playing position. He then smashed Stan over the head with the guitar and kicked him a few times.  "NO!" shrieked Stan. "MY ONE WEAKNESS - BEING INJURED!"  "Now you die, Stan, now you die," said the Baron, standing on one leg for reasons unknown to most mortals.  "But, Baron von Zach - I am your father!" said Stan.  "For true?" asked the Baron.  "No, no, not really," said an exasperated Stan.  "Well will you at least get me yet?"  "Mmm, probably not," said Stan as his head slumped to the ground.  The Baron, seeing that Stan didn't have any more cheesy bad guy sayings to say, pulled his sunglasses out of his pocket and put them on whilst tuning the guitar that Alex had given him. When all the preparations were made, the Baron and the members of Journey (who had magically appeared), began to play the song "Don't Stop Believin'" - the best song ever. Stan spontaneously combusted at this point, and Markus ran away screaming because he was allergic to eighties music.  When the song was over, the Baron put down his guitar, took a picture of himself with the band, kicked Steve Augeri in the face for trying to replace Steve Perry (who was also there), and set out in search of his lost squire.  "Markus!" yelled the Baron as he slowly made his way through the swamp. "Markus, where did you go?"  The Baron unfortunately didn't notice two steely eyes peering out at him from behind a tree. Then again, they didn't have anything to do with the story, so I guess it wasn't so unfortunate. The other pair of steely eyes peering out at him from behind a bush, however, were sure to spell his doom. And they were going to spell it d-o-o-m - not the other way.  UNTIL NEXT TIME...
