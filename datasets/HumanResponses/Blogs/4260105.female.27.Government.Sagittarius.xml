						   I am treading on circles deeply grooved within my path; Never bending—never straightening, they are endless and fast. With every turn--around every curve; My feet march on while my body swerves. Longing for an escape, a break from this pattern; It seems no one else can fathom just how it is in my cold dark cavern. Weary I remain on this ever-dulling plane; Hoping and praying that I will not go insane. I wait for a sign that will break me free from this prison; But ironically it seems, I am staying this direction by my own decision… …I feel my strength gaining now, rising from within; This maddening circle has a light I see at its end. I quicken my pace and steadfast my course; Determined to overcome the feelings of despondency and remorse. There is a road up ahead that reveals a colorful hue; I am walking on the clouds now—I have a panoramic view. Profound possibilities are ahead of me …a course never taken; a new road I can clearly see. My will is returning, my desire to know; The beauty life has to offer; life’s opportunistic glow…

						    The Storm A storm is nearing. I taste its bitterness in my mouth. I feel the fog creep in; Smothering my already saddened heart. The thunder begins to drum, Each percussion beats louder than the next I know too well the intentions of its grumbling text. Where once there was sun, dark clouds now appear I feel the damp misfortune I have always come to fear. The rain begins to fall; it is cold against my skin I stand fast and shiver, unyielding to its whim. Harder and more relentless, it beats down upon me. It rumbles at me to take shelter; roars at me to flee. Undaunted by its anger, steadfast I remain. Because I know the beauty of the rainbow at its end.

						   Let me begin with a story. If you would, please remember a young woman lying on a sofa with a young man sitting on the floor below her; he is looking up at her face. They are talking about feelings and about futures. The young man expresses his love to the girl-she returns by saying that she has feelings for him, yet wants to take it slow. He looks at her and replies, "Its all or nothing. You either love me or you dont. If you dont, I will walk away right now and not look back." Afraid of losing what may be turn out to be the most wonderful experience of her life, she answers his ultimatum: " I love you." They embrace. Later that week, she visits his home. His parents are away and the house is occupied only by the two new lovers. He leads her upstairsdown the halland into a bedroom. He embraces her at the foot of the bed and gently lowers her onto to edge. With great care, he releases her head onto a pillow and caresses her lips with his mouth. With the most delicate of movements he makes love to her, offering her a side of him very few have seen. No doubt enters her mind that this exchange is the most beautiful she has ever experienced. He is tender and kind, and she finds herself falling ever so much in love with him. They luxuriate in each other making each moment together everlasting in her memory. He lies next to her, takes his hand, and gently touches her face. "You are beautiful," he whispers. She smiles and a tear falls down her cheek. "Are you sad," he asks. "No", she replies. "I am happier than Ive ever been." He gets up from the bed, "Relax," he says, as he leans in to kiss her cheek. "Stay here and dont move. Ill be back soon." He was gone for at least twenty minutes, all the while, the young girl wondered where he was and what he was doing. He returned and offered his hand to her. "Follow me," he says. And she does. She follows him to the bathroom at the end of the hall. She sees a warm glowing light escape out of the bottom of the door. When he opens it, she sees a room full of candlelight and a bath filled with bubbles. He leads her to the bath water and helps her in. He bathes her with loving caresses. She adores him. She thinks back to that time and wonders where things went wrong. Years have past and her love for him remains, yet her happiness is beginning to fade. Through the heartaches, the pain, the changes; shes endured. She watches and waits for him, yet she believes his love for her has been lost along the way. They have experienced so much of life together yet so much has been left untouched. She knows every detail of his face. Every curve of his body, every scar and happenstance behind what caused them. The pain; the joy; lifes little curve balls. She has watched as he pulls farther and farther away. She reaches out for his hand and he pulls it away. She wonders what she has done to make him shy from her. Every time he hardens, her heart grows more weary and sad. She has tried to walk away, thinking this the best for them both. To start anew; to begin again. However, every time she does, he draws her back in with wonderful promises of change and readiness for commitment. His promise "I am a changed man," fill her ears with genuine hope that this time it will be different. At first, there is change. Romantic interludes over the phone many times a day, flowers unexpected, endearments made. Then something happens. Promises not kept, feelings misrepresented. She remembers a time not to long ago when she was asked to make a decision. "I need to know if this is something that you want; if you can live my life and love the water as I do," he says to her. After much thought and pondering, she comes to her decision. This is the man she wants to spend the rest of her life with. "I do," she answers. "I want your life. I want to spend the rest of my life with you." With those words, however, she believes she caused him a great scare. Maybe the words he spoke earlier were easier to say than act upon. Perhaps in his mind, and heart, he secretly hoped her answer would be no. Maybe he hoped she would walk away. Unfortunately, perhaps for him, she found herself loving him even more. He grew cold suddenly and perhaps weary of her company. Delighted to see her at first after a time, than happier as she readied to leave. She became weakened and saddened by his withdrawal. The telephone calls stopped. Does he love her? Or is he secretly hoping there is better; with one foot in one door, he tries to open another. He is in fact that stallion who needs to roam. He is not ready to give himself to one person. Greener pastures he believes, there are greener pastures on the other side. Commitment to making one woman happy is a foreign and unwanted concept. For if he was ready, he would not feel as though he is trapped. She is unhappy and saddened by his behavior. She realizes her love for him cannot be returned in kind. He does not want to give willingly and unselfishly of himself as she does for him. She is confused because he says he is ready one moment and another he speaks of his love of bachelorhood and freedom (unspoken freedom from her?) He does not want to lose her; yet, he does not want to make her the only one. He is afraid he is missing out on something. What he does not realize is that he is missing out on the love she can give him. She is confused by his talk of marriage and promises of a wonderful life and the next moment, he says he doesn'tt remember speaking such things. "Enough!" She cries. No more. She is tired and lonely. She wants to be happy. She deserves to be happy. She deserves kind treatment and loving behavior. She deserves to have promises kept. Freedom is what it seems he seeks, so freedom is what she will offer him now. If he chooses freedom, he is free from her forever. She will leave his side and not look back. Never to see or speak to her again. No telephone calls will be answered, when she sees him, she will walk away. If he chooses her, he must commit to making an effort to make her happy, by communicating his feelings, his moods (whether good or bad), by telling her when he is feeling confused. He will remember that she has feelings and they can be hurt by remarks like "I love being alone." And he will not tease her with talk of marriage and a life together unless he means it. I love you Brian. But I cannot be with you when I am as unhappy as I am now. You had so many chances to redeem yourself. You either love me or you dont. And because you dont, I am walking away right now with no intention of coming back; ever. I love you. I will always love you--nothing will ever change that. I just deserve to be happy and you are not making me happy. Maybe there is another person out there that can make you happy. I don't think it's me. I gave you everything I had. I denied you nothing. And still it is not good enough for you. I know deep down inside you are a good person. I just can't compete with other people for your love. It's just not fair. Good luck in your life. I hope you find your true love. You will know it when it happens. I pray for you that she will return your love back. I love you..  Forever are you in my heart, Sara   The Storm A storm is nearing. I taste its bitterness in my mouth. I feel the fog creep in; It is smothering my heart. The thunder begins to drum, Each percussion beats louder than the next I know too well the intentions of its melancholy text. Where once there was sun, dark clouds now appear. I feel the damp misfortune I have always come to fear The rain begins to fall; it is cold against my skin. I stand fast and shiver, unyielding to its whim. Harder and more relentless, it beats down upon me. It rumbles at me to take shelter; roars at me to flee. Undaunted by its anger, steadfast I remain.

						   I figured I would try to give you some insight into my life--hope it doesn't read too much like an autobiography! ::::) Here we go... After graduating high school with my life (barely--story for another time), I attended American University in Washington, DC. I came home after my first year and attended RVCC (community college for a short time until I left home to go out on my own and entered the work force head on. I was employed as a receptionist in salons throughout the area--finding that I loved the beauty industry. I finally found a position that held great interest for me~I managed an upscale salon & day spa in Basking Ridge. Unfortunately, the owner and I did not see eye to eye and found myself seeking another "9-5 home." I vowed after involuntarily leaving the salon... "The next career I choose will be as far away from the beauty industry as possible!" Mission accomplished: I work at a horse stable. I am currently employed by public riding stable in  NJ. I have been here for over three years and I feel as though I've found my own little slice of heaven (or manure, whichever way you look at it.) What a great way to start my day--getting out of my car in the morning and going to say hello to my favorite horse, Dreamer! I am also making plans to start my own business on the side within the year doing Event Planning (because I just love a good party--as my friends will tell you)--Jennifer Lopez, look out! I also want to incorporate catering for small parties and serving into the mix. We shall see--. I thought I would be making waves in the world by now-- setting it on fire with awesome deeds and miraculous feats. Well, so far, I've created some major ripples in some small ponds--I did catch an eyebrow on fire trying to light a cigarette on the stove (hindsight told me later that was a dumb ass move), and I mow my own grass on a weekly basis. Woohoo. See what you can accomplish in 10 years?! Seriously... I do expect that when I take my final siesta--many years down the road, I will be able to leave the people I touched during my lifetime with a smile for I am by far, one of the most interesting individuals you will ever meet. I am a sincere, nurturing, intelligent and sensuous woman. I tend to look at life through rose-colored glasses seeing the world as a spectacular panorama of opportunity. I believe that a person cannot approach anything new without passionate interest in the unknown and a vast openness to uncharted experiences. I enjoy turning heads with my quick, often times unexpected wit and humorous commentary in situations that need levity. My friends know that I am the one person that they can count on for support and understanding. My mantra: "A handful of pine-seed will cover mountains with the green majesty of forest. I too will set my face to the wind and throw my handful of seed on high." -William Sharp As far as recreation, there is no typical weekly activties for me--I usually "go with the flow." I mostly reserve the weekends for going out, but sometimes things come up during the week and I try not to let life pass me by. I enjoy going to the movies, out to dinner (restaurants ranging from elegant to pub-type establishments), going to sporting events, concerts--I love dancing, so clubs are fun. I also love country. There is a country-western dance club near my house that I go to--tons of fun. I never pass up new things though--I am always open to suggestions.

						   Long have I been searching for him...My Mr. Good Morning, My Mr. Good Night--you know, "THE ONE." Where the hell is he?  After finding that my friends were inept at setting me up with quality dating candidates, I decided to join the online dating experience--yup, jumped right on that band wagon. I posted a full time position for a very particular man--this is what I asked for:   ...I can only hope that the individual that responds to my ad has qualities that would make me proud enough to bring him home to meet my mother. I am in search of a man who is intelligent, sincere, honest, caring, and understanding. He will be the one that expertly defines the word "gentleman". This man needs to be well versed and be known for his ability to fit in perfectly in any social situation, a man who sends me flowers when no occasion calls for it, except that he was just thinking about me. I would like to meet a man that has the desire and financial ability to sweep me off to a romantic location on a whim, just because we have no definite plans for the weekend, yet be able to enjoy a romantic candle-lit dinner at home followed by cuddling on the sofa with a good movie. I hope that he is compromising when it comes to the two of us making decisions, yet firm in his beliefs. I believe there is a man that fits my description out there somewhere and I hope that after reading this he will be able to say: "...Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." -Robert Frost    I guess the meat market is slim pickings these days because no male worth mentioning has responded.  Either that, or I am more traveled by than I thought...?
