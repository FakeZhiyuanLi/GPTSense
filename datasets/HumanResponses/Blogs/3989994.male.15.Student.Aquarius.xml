      The interview... Such was the moment very scary and suddenly yout hands are all clammy and your stomache flips and whats worst you are starting to stutter! Never was my thought just yesterday, infact on the way to school in the car i was not too nervous, not even having given it a thought.  It was still not scary when it started and you went. But just after Lim Qian Yu went, i started to freak! So here i am talking with Shu Ming and suddenly it's her turn! now i am all alone, But Mr.Wongs walks in and of cause her turn is delayed, then jokingly we say now there going to want break, guess what Jaspreet gets out to get a drink...!  Ok, so now it's Shu Mings turn since Jaspreet is back, but it a turn of surprises they call me in instead, there i was laughing away now to be called in! What a shock with a grin and a good luck from Shu Ming i was now it a darkened room sitting in front of the three heads.  After a considerable preganant silience, What is your vision for the council? The next few minutes were ok, they passed much faster in this side of the room, who would you choose to be your vice president?  You know my answwer, Shu ming for her talent of bringing things through (summarised) And u for "pour cette petite chose"  Let me tell you, i do not know why but i feel you are the right person to be the president and i am behind you all the way. Do not look back and pursue what you believe in. There is no concrete reason, but we quite all know it is to be you, you were meant for it, make sure you do not make any stops in between and when you  get it do not compromise anything for it, succeed and don't do anything you would regret.  Good luck. And changing is possible expression what would make you like divinity. Forever i would have you in ym heart but chase on.

      It is not about anything about us directly, you would not have ever thought about it. It would only hurt you when you know about it. I want you to do the interview first this would seriously interupt your thoughts i'll tell u after the interview.

      When a friend backsteps you is he now an enemy? How about a friend who stands and watches you fall? is he an enemy? Great things unfold when great stakes are played for. It always amuses me that sometime the "rightous" ppl preach and appear so darn serious abt a point but only to discover that they themselves do not take heed but of course they do it for the greater good.  &nbsp;So is the world like that? The cause need not matter the actions play no part, iniatiative is figurative don't be caught using initiative they punish u for it especially if ur better then them.   So long as u are the power, the authority anything goes. Afterall history is written by the winners

      Nothing to write yet you confuse. The glass shattered? i cannot quite think what you are referring to unless of course...then i say no.   Such terrible feelings i harbour, this entry is going to be rather short, after all the closets can actually be one who hurts most. I never expected him to, i mean would you turn around and betray your brother's trust?  Well he did, maybe not betray but he knew i wanted to be alone yet he kept asking me stupid questions, i mean if i wanted to tell i would why must you insist on knowing eveything? But it's never fair, instead of him my dad things i was being mean toward him!&nbsp; I cannot quite explain my feelings but i am just angry at the whole lot!   I quite am unhappy, have no idea what to do. I just suddenly have this sinking feeling that i have no chance to be president or vice, i just want it to all end! Secretly i harbour hopes of becoming the president but lets face the facts right! I have heard that certain people think that i use others to get what i want. I really don't but people are what people are, sometimes you wonder why we do things to hurt each other, is it just for revenge or perhaps jealousy?  Bereft and saddened my heart sinks to the bottom of the ocean. Light can no longer light the path and love just drowns.

      So the debate is coming this thursday and my team have in all five pathetic and lame points, are we going to go in front of the judges and say " thank you for coming but we've got nothing to say". O but hey! one of the judges is our form teacher not to mention she's the chairperson! Oops...she's also the clever form who's helping our opponent? get a life...?  So it was english class when our team requested for sometime to make preparations not everyone enjoys standing in public only to be surrounded by laughter...She must be used to it by now though. But were we even for a moment considered? nope...  SO anyway who was actually going to listen to her, we just sat near one another with plans to discuss the topic while she wassted her time flashing slides after slides...Listen to her and u might contract brain cancer...  Tang: Why are you not copying? Student: I've got the answer correct. T: Really? but did you phrase it as I have? NO? then COPY IT DOWN! you obviously did not think of writting my version so there is room for improvements! S: huh?  Well ridiculous isn't it? But that is one of the milder audacities that we have to endure during her double periods of dictatorship...  As i was saying, we were huddled at the back, and then she insist on moving back to our seats.  ME: But we really do not have enuf time for the debate T: U shld solve that urslef Madhu: Cld we pls use this time, we cld catch up on the work from our friends. T: Nope, you plan to talk while i am teaching? M:u teach? or flash transparencies? and yes we plan to talk! T: Well then you might want to go outside. PPl in the class: Really, we can leave the class?  SO then she goes hysterical and all screachy...she even threathens to place ppl in detention for not putting on thier nametags....  Life would be simpler had she just died, but i don't want that. My life wld then be void of bitching! Stupid women.  I have half a mind to quit and leave the team in shit, madhu is considering as well, i wld love to see her stinking face on that day, it would probably be christmas early, i wonder whether her beautiful B-square wld be able to secure a win for them.   She's spoilt my day and ruined my mood she better not hope i don't see her, anytime soon i just my walk over and suffocate her with her own fats!~

      I have got lots of stuff to do this week! I have got to complete and english essay and re write some stupid piece of work! I thought it was not graded so i did not lift a finger in completing it...oops wrong word, it's not complete and she passed me blooming miracle. She gave me a rather high score for language and failed me terribly on content... not much was there? did not even come close to grazing the word quota. Ok so it was my fault for doing a terrible job! she was shocked when she read my piece i'm sure. Just love doing that!   &nbsp;Talking about english i had my english paper today. It was horrifyingly tough! The comprehension passage was bloody difficult, the questions down right absurd, the answer, what answer! aghhh i left it all blank! nah... the section on the meaning was revolting i knew like one out five..i mean waht is periphy? or something like that. The summary was a total disaster...i was not quite sure what they required you to do, and my answer seamed so repetive and had no consistent flow... You get my drift? IT SUCKED!&nbsp;  Ok enough whining, by now you would most likely thing i am some whinger or something... Tuesday thats morrow, i've got to stay back after school for extra math...sense something wrong? and after that i have got to stay a little more for a session with the rest of the debate team to prepare for the upcoming debate. I'm the fourth speaker...yeah i am good...(head swells...and nose grows longer). Ok the topic is "mother tongue should not be an examinable subject" and we're preposition...this is like a blessing since i have never passed my mother tongue by more than 5 marks before... Today i had a free period, ironically it was mother tongue, so i started on our points for the debate, me and madhu...we did not get far, it suddenly dawned on me how hard the topic is.   But alas all things must go wrong for me, afterall that is how the world is, so as i would have it the debate which is going to be held on the 29th a thursday happens to clash with my interview for the presidential candidates, and given&nbsp; a choice we all know which one a person would choose but unfortunately my dictator of a teacher insists that the debate is more important! AGHHHH how thick can a person get?  Just wondering, do you by any chance know what they do at the brittish council? why are there suddenly so many signing up? The only brittish thingy i know would be the brittish high commision...don't laugh  You know you love me...(a little overbearing but hey...it's my blog)

      When a person stares directly into love, does he walk away from it unchanged? Can he walk away from it? Or does it leave him scared forever? I was just wondering about the nick, did it really mean that? Care? can a person care enough? Is it ever enough? Don't you always want more? Love is such, when you walk away from it you just know more, you look at thigns differently.   &nbsp;

        Ok, the party was an absolute BORE!!!      Ok so there were people and stuff so it was fun for like the first 1 or 2 hours but then later it became boring since there was not much to do... The people there were mostly girls and i did not know them so...the conversation was rather stilted. Mostly introductions, the people i knew were few only michael and Valerie and the host...racheal.      I was not feeling to good anyways, i don't know but i have been awfully grumpy these past few days, annoyed or angry i am not quite sure... possibly PMS...but i am a guy.       &nbsp;   Hated yesterday...the racial harmony celebration was comparable to staring at the wall...yes it was darn boring. And even worse, lessons were carried on as per normal.     I had the stupid math test which i so know i flunked.     I knew how to do the question but a misinterpretaion of the question and i drew my graph inversed! it was blooming upside down! I just give up...Like as if things can't get worst my bloody leg hurts!       &nbsp;   Grumpy and annoyed     byrOn

      The greatest female conundrum...What outfit to pick. If we had not known better we would think that it would be the end of the world if their outfit made their thighs look 0.1 cm thicker than it's current 5cm! "aghhh i am so fat!". They have obviously not met msr Osman...She is so large she is solely responsible for the damage to the flooring in the school, not only that you seriously should see her car! It is lopsided to the drivers side. I'm not taking the mickey out of you, Seriously. It's really mean to say so but she seam to think she is going to drown any moment, getting all the safety gear...Her butt is seriously so filled with lard, she would float right to the top! Ok, enough of this Fat talk afterall fat is beautiful or so says some website dedicated to becoming obese!   What was i writting about again?  Morrow I've got a party to be going too, so can't wait to go. Have been waiting for quite some time actually. It's a birthday party of one of my friends and guess what i have not gotten him a present yet! i'll have got to drop by and get one before heading off to his place...   Outfits, once i said it was a women problem well i lied! I chose my outfit in like 5 seconds but terribly i cannot find anything to match my bandages around my leg...  Nothing serious (don't pretend ur concerned)   It happened so fast, they passed me the ball, i dribbled stumbled over it and fell. The fall was in slow motion...no it wasn't it was like....Boom. Awww... my leg hurts! whats worse about 10 minutes later while i was sitting watching the others kick the ball around... It starts to Rain and blooming heavy it rained.   Wet,hurt and filled with rubbish...i wrote this post.   You know you love me.

      I hate this dreaded subject, i mean how can it always be the topic of my posts! it seams to haunt me, follow me around! I keep failing it and it keeps adding to my stress levels sometimes you just feel like giving it all up and quitting!   Again, it hurts me the way the subject is so vindictive! It hurts me! It goes all out to get me, revenge against me! but what had i done to it? It despises me as i despise it, it plays mind games with me, what am i suppose to do? I could be fretting for a test i had very little idea on how to do...and manage to scrape a pass one week and spend the next cramming and practicing for the next. And YET! again and again it stumbles me, i know the method, the technique but i just cannot get around the obstacle of horrible luck, you sometimes feel it is all an elaborate plot to get you!  I saw the paper and smiled fortune shone down upon me, i started at it furiously plannign on improving my grade on this test. It was rather smooth going maybe not all that easy but it was managable...then came the second question...(the paper is made up of two questions) It was such a give away....  I completed it in good time, what a relieve, and then i realised my graph was drawn backwards, all the numbers were wrong the axises were both wrong!arghhhh  I stared at the clock and my watch confirmed my fate... i had five minutes left... school was out, i had failed yet another test, my plans to catch&nbsp; a movie shelfed i left...annoyed, hurt and angry.  The mind heals but the heart is torn asunder...

      Right out of a teen flick where some kid turns up without his pants! Laughter and the wishing the world swallowed&nbsp;him whole. It happens in real life! Maybe not exactly a nerd&nbsp; but sometimes it happens to normal people too!   Tomorrow is some celebration of racial harmony thing, so we are going to dress in ethinic costumes, so a few of us went over to friend's place to try out some stuff she had, i got this splendid looking suit, it was ravishing in cream and claret.   I when in to the room to try it on, and it looked gorgeous but not knowing quite how to wear it i did not realize the pants was missing since it looked complete so, sure i was not exposing anything but still, the shock when the more *enlightened* ones burst out into peals of laughter and started going where's your pants! It did not help that there were girls!!!   The feeling was terrible, a sunken sought of feeling, since i was not revealing any underwear or *stuff* it was not to bad but you just thought how it was going to be when you faced them. I was sweating it off, but they did me a favour and not laughed when i came out...   Whew, hope the gossip forum in class does not catch wind of this!   &nbsp;

       So it now begins, the ending of a previous chapter and the opening of a new. I walked out of it feeling relieved yet sorrowful, why did we want to be together in the first place?   Ok...enough of that made up nonsense, my life by far pales in comparisons compared to what i would write in a book or essay...    &nbsp;  So it was a typical day without a *girlfriend* (i am not gay! just in a school that well...). I got back my math test results, and surprisingly, i did not flung! i barely passed though had a miserable 56% compared to the two perfect scorers seating in my group...arghh!!!    &nbsp;  And i am also in the running for student's council presidency! The interviews are coming up this monday! I had better start thinking knowing me...    &nbsp;  Interviewer:&nbsp;What would you do if you were president?   Me: Errrr... i would like a chicken whooper and hold the fries please   inter: excuse me? I think you got the place wrong!   Me:Arghh..sorry,i am always doing this, so can i get a plain taco instead?   inter:Get out!    Me: Fine way to treat your customers! You'll not be seeing me anytime soon! (stomps out)   inter:Stupid Boy! since when do you burgers or tacos at delifrance?...    &nbsp;  Nah, i am not that daft but trust me i can say things that are equally dumb. Ok i am gonna end this entry i have to catch up on my homework which have been undone for the past week! It&nbsp;hurts to do 9 subjects! I'd drop my second language if i had to though, my teacher looks like as if he had been thoroughly been slapped!&nbsp;

      You stare around you and you start to notice things things, when an enviroment changes people are usuallytaken aback but are easily reconciled with what they cannot change. It hurts no one. Sometimes you look deeper and you realise, people change. You cannot stop it, you can only stand and watch. There are those whom you liked for what they were, when change happens to fast or you are suddenly shakened, and wake to a totally different person, you are left to stand and wonder why?  A person is liked or admired for his qualities but not only is it just that, unknowingly you make certain bonds, links with that perosn and you cannot alter that, when he/she changes and suddenly drives you away more often then not u are left hurt and broken. People are the what makes most things live. Simple words could bring a depressed man away from the buildings edge, but those same words could stab a man so badly he rather die then fight to live.  A person broken by another is a person no longer. He becomes an empty shell, with mind but no love, no feelings, no emotions, the anithesis of passion he becomes more than dead. For what good is living without actually enjoying the bliss, not feeling the pain, to live is for a greter purpose never just to amble through life and do nothing.  Every person, every body has done something for the rest of us, for himself except perhaps he may have done in a small way, you not proof gravity, heal the sick or donate millions to charity. The simple words or a kind gesture of understanding of believe or inspiration or the life you lead yourself can change a person heart or his destiny. If you chose not to live do not obstruct anothers way, let him breathe and be exulted by the change from sky blue to the black of velvet.  A persons words can drive through anothers heart, thing before you say, some words may seam sharp but pierce only the skin but the simplest words or actions are usaully the most hateful. Without hate there is no love, and without love there can be no life, it slips past your fingers but that feeling of love is forever, the most stoned person would be melted to feel love. The things we cannot understand is usually the greatest of things. We were not meant to understand all.  The general believe would make out the world to sound in choas but i know that it is not true. After all when the soldiers were going to war and knew they would likely not return did they make calls of hatred and revenge? I believe it were all messages of love.  Let love rest in your heart,  love to you all,

      Hey all, today's biology test was rather simple apart form the tiny fact that i did not study for it, aghh... still can do fairly i guess, not really too difficult but honestly i feel like kicking my own arse, but not easy i am telling you. (stretching so much)  Ha i was right, the first title to the shopaholic series is, the secret dreamworld of a shopaholic. I was actually arguing over a title? But guess what i feel real dumb not to have realised the book was released under two titles so, both titles were actually right.  School was the usual boring. After school i went back and guess what? i was actually practicing maths, not so much studious but more of scared out of my pants that i am going to top a fail for the coming exams.  Really weird isn't it? The exams coming up so soon? it felt like as if it were only a month ago that we were on Hols. I guess time does fly or it could be the sneaking system which hides and suddenly springs an exam on you! I think the latter.  Well hope the rest of you are starting revision and if you happen not to be in school anymore or are not having an exam anytime soon...well, envy.... Bully to you!  Love to you, and good luck, you're going to need it, i need a MIRACLE!!!

      Ok, my plants were delieverd, wow it was bloody heavy, the guy could not carry by himself and had to call some other guys to help, about three of the never occured to me plants were heavy. So now i have a red palm as well as a green palm in my balcony, they are quite tall about 2.5 metres.  Missed watching cartoons this morning! I went to church earlier than usual since i had lunch with some people* ( brother and his gf...). My brother has stopped going to church since he was 16 so it did not bother him to check whether we could make it. I love watching prince of tennis really, and yu gi oh. By any chance you watch them? I think the Japanese make the best cartoons. So church was the usual.  My dad is not catholic so he goes to another church with my grandmother, so he came later to pick me up and Harry, Harry's dad does not go church unless it is some event like christmas mass or passing over feast and to think he is my godfather, godfathers are supposed to guide you spiritually but i guess it is really more for the formality.  Now, the juicy bits. Lunch. I still cannot how a pathetic sod like my brother(i am delibrately making him look bad cuz i am jealous,hahaz) could actually get a girl. Well he brought her back for their term break, so she's living in his place, thats why he does not come over so often now. She must be able to cook cause he is total crap at it.  Well she's ok looking, not supermodel but funnily enough she is taller than my brother who is not exactly a 6 fter himself. Well she seams nice enough, and i wld not mind her getting married...hahaz. She spent more time talking to my dad then my brother if i had not known better i would think she was flirting with my father than rather than my brother. But i have one misgiving, she keeps calling me "baby brother" do  i look that young? or is she just stupid. When she met me and harry she asked whether we were about 12 year old? how dumb can you get, i bet even in America we do not look like twelve year old kids i think she was just being dumb. Also she loves saying"how true...blah blah." "How true,blah blah".  Ok so thats about it for lunch, dinner was fine. Then i decided to come and write this message for the blog and thats about it, it's about 10 o'clock so i wld be going to sleep soon, have a biology test morrow.  Love to you,

      llow, so i am back here,sprouting rubbish as usual. Got up really late, i woke just in time for lunch was up the whole night previously. Not even a good reason...hahaz (playing playstaion 2).  So had lunch at home, and after i went with my dad, to go choose some plants for my balcony. It was really boring actually all the plants look the same and the one i really wanted was to big. So in the end i settled for some other plants.  So soon my balcony would be boasting four types of palms, could you imagine! i was really tired and bored that i just chose four plants from about the same place, so it turned out to all be palms just different types but anyway they do not quite look the same apart from their leaves...soon i would be in horticulture!  Digressing, talking about plants i was trying to study for bio test and i realised that plants really are quite facinating, i mean if they were sucking up water due to evaporation how come trees in cold places are so tall? should it not have much transpiration since it sheds it's leaves? so not much water should be able to reach the top should the tree not just die?...ok. Enough of pretending to actually think of such rubbish.  So as i was driving back home.(dad was driving not me) I saw the this van which had such a perculiar name. "WTF bed and linings" so well gross isn't it. I mean wtf stands for what the fuc# and then bed and lining! i could not help but laugh at the strange name, maybe it was actually a prostitute buisness..My mine is wandering abit here hahaz.  Ok, i hope everything when well with the principal and all and i too am surprised she had time... did the tree heads sit in? (tree for wooden, blur, stupid, thick!) I hope everything when well, no council member knows about my blog right? Just ensuring.  good night now, or morning rather it's really late/early so i had be going to bed have not been sleeping well the past week.  Love to you

      Yesterday night was spent helping that blasted boy Harry finish his homework, so annoying leaving so much homework for the last minute, so anyways i managed to finish for him his composition as well as his comprehension, is it just me or english papers just filled with the letter c? "compre" " Compo" unless of course you say essay but then what the heck.  Ironically i did not finish my english homework and that vindictive teacher of mine who took away five marks from my common test becasue she felt my answers did not conform to the question sstructure. DO you even understand what she meant? hahaz. Denied me an A1 only one person got it anyway. Nabil  So i was told to attend detention for not completing my summary but i finished during class so i skipped detention hopefully she has got nothing to say, tomorrow morning at least. My english period was free since she was involved in the oral examinations for the Gcse's. But coniving women would never let us relax for a moment she makes us work like dogs, so it was a composition. Half way thorough class she appeared, and quite funnily somebody snickered and pass the comment " look who got kicked out of the oral exams..." ok maybe not funny but there is always that sadistic joy.  Math was terribly boring just as was physics, he seems stricter, Mr peterson.  I mean he is still his friendly enigmatic person with lots of charm according to Sarah but i feel he is more serious now about his homework...ha but fortunately i did it.  Bio was a total fiasco, we were blowing into the indicator to test for Co2 but of course Dillon had to play a fool and he had a patch of it fall exactly at you know where of a boys anatomy...don't blush. More irony just before that we were testing for the presence of water and he said we should test our urine, the spot of yellow looked like as if he was doing just that.  Do not feel upset, do not wish to be ignorant, i have told you and i because i trust you, Good luck on tomorrow to my speacial one. As to all others...but of course it would be normal for the rest of you unless you have math test like me.  I seem to have more math tests than dinners...  You know you love me, Byron

      I ask you, how many friends do you really have? Can a person really have hundreds of friends? I ask you to remove all those who would leave the moment you were not cool anymore or when you leave school. True friendship is really rare, when you come across it, treasure it never let it go. A friendship that is truly stong is likened to love, you care for that person so much it would hurt you to see that person fail, yet it would bring you to your hearts end when they triumph!  It  is never about what you could do together but it is about what you do for yourself because you know whatever it is you are going to do would be good for the both of you, and that you can count on the other person to support you.  Even when you both are competing secretly you wish the other could also win. A true friendship is something that is eternal, it need not be long it need not be wordy, it is something that would last forever a imprint into your life that you treasure.  I can say that i have only met two people with whom i share this love for, and this is dedicated to the future head.  Thank you for what you have done for me, I appreciate it alot more than it may seam, from the way a smile touches the tips of your lips when you smile to the time you sweard in seondty two. "f...... sh.." haha.  With love forever and best wishes, Your friend

      How many times have you walked to deep onto a forest only to fins out that infact it is nothing but a garden? Can a garden pretend to be a forest?  It may get the added awe and respect but when the woodcutters come, can the garden back into a corner and say it is not actually a forest?  Deceit, is a painful game, and when you stumble too far in, there is little coming back out. If you wanted soemthing work for it, do not stop till you get it, and do not ever compromise.  Live like you want to, not what falls into your way.

      I heard of the results, shocking, definitely, i never thought i would be in the weakest few, but i was to learn i was not, i overperformed? what kind of bull is that? can a person be penalised for being to good? obviously.  Not in because they had a person in mind for president and if i was among the few they were worried mrs.neo would pick me because of my speaking skills and the way i handled the interview,so they killed the threat before it could do anything.  Despicable, not really politics is after all a dirty game, but i am truly disasapointed, because they have revealed that they have their own agendas, to accomplish and are treating the whole selection process as a mere formality.  I cannot do anything about it accept question whether after so much investment, had i chose the right group? was i actually promoting deceit?  I am sorely dissapointed at the way we have decieved and (remember wha ti said about an ellaborate joke?) i ,well i not know it is quite true.  May the next president be stronger and more willing to step forward and run the council. I am not condeming the current three but the system which stiffles people into making it a day to day thing, circumstance makes us what we are.  Good luck to the rest running espeacially you, Love, byron

      Lighter side of things, coming weekend is really a long one! We've got sat,sun,mon,tues and i'll be skipping school on friday! Whats more i am going to Thailand,Bangkok on fri evening with a couple of friends, need to pick some stuff but i shall be back by monday morning since we'll be having a class BBQ on that day, hope i;d be fun.  I am so looking forward towards the end of the week, only now i have got to get across the mind field of test! I have got chemistry coming up tomorrow (tues) and i seriously stink at it, have not quite got the grasp of the tested chapters nor have i been paying attention so i have about 2 or so hours to master it! haha...i am always doing this to myself! 1.)Hopefully the paper is darn easy. 2.)We seat wherever we want and do not need to separate our tables. 3.)open book test 4.)She feels like sharing with me her results and the most likely 5.)i become genius...hey wait i already am,oops...no, i am not...sorry.  And then i still have got to clear the social studies test, why social studies? and not darth of all students or perhaps mega difficult test on information you need not know... The sod of a subject is bloody difficult to fail decently yet pass decently...I mean do we seriously need to know such bullshit? We'll i guess if they feel adding this highly challenging and idiotic subject to our curriculum is going to instill national pride and all...go ahead but only i find it ironic that after all this national pride thingy, it's causing us to fail...what is that suppose to signal to us?  I'll be a quitter...they seam to be better off, then "stayers"...  You know u love me

      Jealousy,anger,hatred are just all what they were meant to be expressions. So you must have succeded now that you can express so clearly, are women the most jealous creatures? I cannot say though i can tell you you're not. Why are you jealous? why is a person jealous? Is there any justification for such strong raging emotions i believe there is as there is always...sometimes we need to feel such strong urges or "humors"( shakesphere calls it humors, in their time they believed that the liver was where love came from) can only reassure us that we are human and that there is still things out there than we cannot get over, i mean what is a world without the failures?  Do not fear, the fact that there is a re-interview means they saw you as a likely target, do not fear be confident plan what you want to say now that you quite have the hang of the questions, be confident and do not falter.   A girl with ebony hair and an auburn gaze turns and walks away from love towards ambition, nothing should stop her nothing should make her fall yet something troubles her, she looks back into the shadows and she sees love always, never faltering . Steeling her self she puts her foot forward and her gaze now locked on her goal a soft radiating smile touches her lips, beauty exist in many forms, strength and confidence is just one.   Believe, and you would succeed do not look back, you know you are meant for it do not regret nor should you feel anyone else is better.  With luck and ever lasting warmth
