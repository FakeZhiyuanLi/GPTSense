      Didn’t get much sleep last nite coz wasn’t feelin gd.. Well got up very early today at abt 6 I guess.. Prepared my No.4 coz today got to head up to 3 Div for an inspection. Basically I was told by my senior medic to go there to assist in inspecting the medical center there in jurong camp.. Dad sent me there coz its on the way to his werkplace. Reach there 5 mins to 8. My snr medic n alif was there already. We all waited for the time to start inspecting.. Before anything could even happen we were scolded by the snr medic there.. Sucky indeed. He was a warrant officer. He was making a big fuss coz the ones checking his medical center is lower rank than he is.. I mean wat the heck rite if u really do u werk well y worry rite… Its not as if some pte or some cpl gonna care much bout his medical center.. Well he was always breathing down our neck the whole time when the inspection was carried out… He just finding ways to find fault with us…when we actually left the place abt 2 I was so relieved.. He is so damn annoying.. wonder how his children can cope with this… pity them!!! Well went to Banquet in Jurong for lunch.. Had carrot cake which seems to taste sweet rather than hot ahhah.. stupid!!.. After that went window shopping a bit with alif n me senior medic.. Head back to camp straight away after that.. Need to do rush lost of werk so that I would be able to have a peaceful weekend.. Well this sat is so call my family BBQ at one of the bungalows in Pasir Ris.. Reach camp at abt 5++.. Start werk at 6 finish at 11.30.. Fuuuh wat a tiring day… Well trip to Jurong was indeed a wasted one coz if I were not to go there then I could have completed my werk earlier…

      Sigh....Welcome home to myself :) Hey guess wat? Its dat time of the year again when u say to urself Hapi Birthday...Oh was it suppose to be dat way.. Sigh wat the heck... Birthdays are always suppose to be hapi but oh well dat is never the case for me... Never... Well as usual for the last numerous occasion today is just another day on the calender. Well let it be decided how well today have gone by... Lets talk about yesterday... I try my best to be happy and cheary yesterday coz i dont want to spoil today.. Not coz its my stupid birthday...But well its my 4 yr Anniversary with my baby... Well as from previous postings, it is shown that i had not been feeling fine these past few days... Generally coz its my baby... She have been superbly being a real ...... Scolding and blaming me just making me angry... For no reasons that is.. She wants me at the same time rejects me... Sigh wat the heck she really wants.. N as usual my weekend goes down the drain... Well still feelin shitty.. Oh then one fine morning she wakes up on the correct side of the bed n was fine.. She then expects me to be just fine just like dat.. Oh well i was hurt n simply just coz she if fine she expect me to be fine... Then when i m not fine n i say i got no mood then well as usual she freak out at me... N well wat can we say she thought that i take her for granted and treat her as though she got no feelings.... Yeah not suggesting anythin but it seems i am always the one taken for granted.. She can do so much to me n i just have to presevere... Wat kind of crap is dis...Well at the same time i m piss off with her... She always have to start any phone conversation or even other conversations talking about how irritating she is with her close frien name Miss X... Well after she talks bout her then i will lost my mood to talk.. Coz it always end up with the same scenario... I wonder after a long hard day at werk i wonder is a normal person which to hear complains rather than their love ones ask about how was their day...Well it keeps on hapenning even after i tell off.. So tell me wat have i done wrong... Well i really hope even with us fighting she can put everything aside n maybe sing for me a birthday song at the stroke of midninght 27 July... Somethin that have never happen since the time we got together...Well like every year its all hopes n dreams... Well We really got in a "very good" note at the stroke of midnight... Well i dont have a song but someone else calling me Jerk instead.. Hehehh seems funny how gd ur birthday could be... Well once again overslept practically n didnt go for breakfast again today... Well got a few birthday wishes though in the morning on my hp... Well thought maybe the day will turn up gd instead for me... Well Its Pre-IQA today for my medical centre... Dats y i cant take off.. But wondering y should i take off for it will be just a waste coz wats the point of having such a pathetic birthday... Its a tiring one indeed.. Ppl from other medical centre did checks on the medical centre.. Me involves with meetings one after another.. Been busy at the same time some&nbsp;medics from company lines piss me&nbsp;off further by&nbsp;requesting for too much&nbsp;when&nbsp;they provide so little...&nbsp;Ah fuck them!! They do not appreciate wat is being given to them... Sleep all the time n yet when ppl ask them to do a bit they can just complain... BUnch of pussies...But at least u can say one thing really great happen to me n dat is i was so busy that i myself forgot today is my birthday ehhehe.. dats is somethin really great... oh yeah n not forgetting my baby gave me a call n sang me a birthday song.. Oh well at least the song came rite although it was late.... well by then i wasnt in the mood so well we just take the greetings as just greetings... Oh mum call me just now whether i m coming home today so can cut cake.. I was expecting maybe a small celebrations whenre ppl are ard nmy baby can turn up... BUt well when i ask mum whether my baby can come she told me not to.. She said the house is messy..ONE A LAME REASON RITE... I m sick n tired of having to accomodate other ppl request for my own birthday.. I thought it suppose to go the other way round??&nbsp; Ah wat the heck... Got home no one sings for me a birthday song... okie then.. guess its just another day rite...well my dad got some lessons to attend to, sis not in the mood coz she lost her hp, mum busy preparing stuffs for sat n bro watch tv... Well i guess lets cut the damn cake n get it over n done with lah rite.. The more its not done the more it gets on my nerve... Ah wat the heck.. Lets continue this busy week again.. I tink i m better of in camp doing work then to be in dis state.. Well those meetings sure give me lots of headache... Well i really tink that my anniversary date should change.. Its really stupid to have it on my birthday coz to have one stuffs not working for me is bad enough but TWO?? DAT JUST DRIVE ME NUTS.. OKie got to do my office work n well wait for the cut cake ceremony.. Yeah tink should make this day HAPI CAKE CUTTING DAY rather than my birth day... Heheheh how bout Happy Pitiful day hahaha woooo lets see wat we can do bout it hehehe...

Many times but i just sabar.. Coz if ikut kan hati i will tell her off.. Then comes with going out with my baby.. I donno ah.. Maybe my Baby's parents do not like me or somethin.. I dont really go out with my Baby that often these days... But still her parents say she always go out.. Spoils my mood... Then fine... Then when i am at her place when both her parents are at home.. Then they will give me this umcomfortable feeling as to when i am going home... Its hard to describe but well it did happen quite directly bout 2 weeks back... Donno how to describe...

      BRAVO COY… BRAVO COY…. BRAVO COY , BRAVO COY,&nbsp; BRAVO COY.. WE ARE THE BEST WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS.. WE ARE THE BEST IN 2SIR HOOOAHHH!!!. Heheheh Was sent to 2SIR on June 24th after passing out from SMM as a combat medic. Was deployed to Bravo Coy on 7 July 2003.. Lots of memories since then. Bravo Coy was the first to achieve operational ready status for the 11th mono 2SIR intake. Well I thought its kinda stupid to be posted 1 day before their first Alert red Manning which is on 8 July 2004.&nbsp; When I first got there the first person I met was Pte Adam or whom we call SATAN (coz his name tag is written as Si Ann Tan = SATAN) heheh. He is also kinda big size and got to know he also got posted in there mths back. He told me to expect hell in Bravo coz everyone is vying for gold standards. Well passing is just the dream for me. During the routine tournout preparation for the Alert Red manning I was introduced to my Platoon commander then was Lta Yazid, my platoon sergeant PS John, the different section commander and my fellow platoon mates heheh. Still remember the day when somebody call out for me from the officer’s mess. This guy (who later I realize was my PC) talked to me but I am unsure who he is heheh Coz the first time he talk to me he was using helmet. J On the week itself I was given the welcome greetings by going for run and going for their PT. On that week itself I was kinda a bit pressurize by the future that awaits me… Damn.. Did many route marches ard camp and out of camp. My first major outfield with Bravo was during the time when we go for 14km route march with FBO to marsilling and stayed there to practice on our river crossing. Dat was really the first time when I really got to carry my FBO dat includes my stretcher and MOP for a really good distance. That was also the time when Bravo Coy really respect me for the weight I carried and for the endurance and perseverance I showed throughout the march. Well I was also shielded a lot by my PC from doing SOC and Ippt. Well he knows my problem.. I was really big then n still am now heheh. But I made my promise then to him that I put in effort to lose down my weight in return he allowed me not to take my IPPT. Well had lots of outfields after that. That is where I build up my endurance and learn more on how my company fight. Met lots of enemies from normal infantry men to the ADF of Spear coy. All this is to prepare us for our final exam which is ATEC in April 2004. We went for EX Buckspeed, an exercise to test our battalion capability. That was the first time I saw so much SAF vehicles and equipment heheh and there is where I learnt lots of&nbsp; “terms” which is usually used by my fellow platoon mates. That was one hell of an exercise. We walk and walk for donno how far.. Go against rain while pursuing our exercise with heavy equipment. I swear many many times for being in that condition but after 4 days of heat, rain, marches and etc we finally end our exercise. Every father mother son in that battalion was awarded with a Temasek badge to signify we are operational ready heheh. Although tired, I was really proud of myself for what I had achieved. My first SAF badge hehehe. After buckspeed we had many other difficult outfields to constantly prepare us for Brunei and ATEC later on heheh. After being awarded operational ready we are tasked with many many operational duites. One of it happen to be during the time we are having Alert Red. On that fateful day we really had a busy day. Just came back from range at ard 12am…After finish cleaning our arms and washing up ourselves for the day I can swear that I don’t even have the energy to open my eyes. Wore back only 1 side of my socks and suddenly my body just switch off.. EXACTLY 3 am in the morning, our batallion siren rang… OH SHIT WAT THE HECK IS GOIN ON!! I have not wore my shoes, have not kept my magazines in my SBO and many more.. Was rushing n rushing like mad dog hahaha.. Ran down and manage to be on time for the turnout… hahahh was panting and panting like mad.. Even when those senior staffs who came to check our stuffs, I was still panting heheh. Within 15 mins to the siren, many vehicles came into my battalion. Guess those are supply trucks carrying ammunition and other supplies hehehe. Wow this really really and well it is REAL!!! Hehehe Crazy shit and I am happy to be part of it. Well We were deployed in CMPB at 5am that same morning for OPS Basinet. :P After proving ourselves worthy defenders of Singapore we were entrust to do Ops duties in protecting key installations in Singapore. Well all this spreads into the schedule till December where we then flew off to Brunei for training. Our first overseas exercise. We were there exactly 2 weeks. Well really miss my family back then.. Heheh never left them for so long before. Well the route to our training site which is in Temburong was far and boring. Its basically trees and small villages dwelling ard. Went for my exercise NOMAD which is an exercise to condition us of the terrain in Temburong. Hahah guess wat it rain all through the exercise.. Got ourselves lost there too during that exercise. Ehhehe Got our pictures with a ghost, slept under ppl home, walk endlessly and pointlessly without knowing our route and climbing hill after hill with a wet and muddy terrain.. heheh. Crazy things to happen. Well the jungle there is so dark that u cant even see ur palm in front of u at nite. Its so dark… Like u are blind or something. Lots of funny memories there. After walking for 2 days ++ we finally found our way out when we accidentally came across the ZEBU trail.There is this famous insect there called the cicada which sounds like a cricket only much much louder.. heheh Went for Exercise Buaya the main exercise of our Brunei trip. It’s a 4 day event. Happen to rain before the 1st day.. Well as predicted the ground is muddy and slippery. This was also my first time carrying my FBO for the exercise here. Walk n walk under the hot sun for the whole day. Guess the skies pee too much that it didn’t have any left to give us for shade. Attacked our objective, slept for the nite then woke up flew off on a UH1H chopper to the foot of Mount Biang. Our objectives is to climb up Mt Biang, cross over the other side river cross at Batu Apoi. Walk through the 7 hills and attack our last objectives. Well my PS really help me a lot during this mission. Climbing up that damn mountain isn’t hard.. Going down is… U can climb up within 4 hrs but going down takes a whole day… Halfway through the journey something bad happen.. One of the PC from Bravo fell and injured his leg… As the shout for MEDIC!!! I rushed down to see what happen.. As I ran down I myself got hurt.. Due to the slippery stones I end up injured myself.. Well dat doesn’t matter coz others is more imp.. SO treated dat PC then try to evacuate him out from there.. Cant air lift him coz do not have any clearance… so wat to do have to evac him through the cold slippery river bank..It was one hell of a time there as each and everyone of us work hand in hand to help evac dat PC of ours… We we reach to the hill of Batu Apoi we then have to rushed before last light to cross over the river… We hurried and successfully cross over… By then I guess my leg just cant take it anymore… Didn’t want to make another problem if halfway I cant walk anymore so I fall out after the crossing… Well Hafiz ( PC runner) also fell out coz of&nbsp; fever.. Dat nite was really freaky… My buddy Hafiz nearly died… Well saved him then but do not wish to talk abt it….&nbsp; Well after all the exercise was over n yes we were en route to home once again. Everyone was delighted when the flight crew says Welcome Home Boys!!! Hhehehe After coming back from Brunei we were quickly fill with a very busy schedule.. Lots of outfields, a number of Alert red manning, lots of Ippt and Soc training( something I dread a lot) and finally Intep( the exercise which is like a preliminary exam for us before Atec.. That was also the day where as much we walk.. we have to dig lots of shell scrapes tooo… Fuck up thanx to my brigade commander… Well finish that and we were on our final prep for Exercise Starlight(TAIWAN).. As we were about to go for our break before flying off, we were call upon for a real operation which is Ops Double Hammer… A manhunt in the heart on Pulau Tekong.. After few days they finally captured the 3 robbers which came in from Malaysia… Then we were off to Taiwan… Taiwan was really a very memorable experience for us.. We were there for about 5 wks ++ and going for two exercise.. Exercise High Noon (^brigade exercise) and ATEC.. We arriver during the turn of the season… Winter just ended but the cold winds from the costal water of Kaoshiong were still strong…Doors in our bunk can just open and close on its own.. U can see how powerful those winds were.. It can be really cold in the morning.. Heheh wat can I say like our other exercises there are full of long distance marches, lots of cold nites, plenty of combat ration, many memories and 1 incident that nearly kill me heheh.. Well got overly exhausted and panting till my lungs nearly collapse.. Felt going to die when my wind pipe suddenly closed for a moment.. Could not breathe for a while but manage to pull myself together again… hehehe.. Well there is also lots of Ninja Van which followed us through our exercise.. They are just selling foods from vans.. Generally we are not allowed to purchase to prevent us from getting sick for no reason, but then once in a while we did buy. Its like a bonus..J My favourite hill call Shi Ma Li San that I dream off even before we go for our ATEC.. Well miss my family and my baby lots when I was in Taiwan.. Well manage to get in reach with them through my Hp(bills which still clearing off now) and the internet that is available in Heng Choon camp. RNR was superb.. Went to many places of interest in Kaoshiong which includes Kenting(a sea side surfer nite market) and their theme park.. Crazy roller coaster rides and lots of pictures just make it a well remembered trip.. Heheheh Got back from Taiwan did our last Alert Red and had generally been slacking since then… We were given a chance to fly on a Chinhook and also SAF Super Puma choppers.. Travelled in assault boats and also Lark 5 for our coastal hook training J SO many things but well as much as u r tired reading this I m getting tired too writing it hahaha.. Well cut things short I continue to slack a lot in Bravo.. Played games both physical and board games in camp.. Catch lots on sleeping and clearing offs hehehe Wow all this in 1 yr.. My most memorable 1 yr and significant one during my NS life here.. Well Bravo Coy love u guys.. Thanx for being there with me and give me morivation and great company throughout.. Well enough of the Ippt and Soc training in Bravo I am here to realx to in Battalion HQ hahaha Yee haaa Bravo Bravo Bravo will always be in my heart...

      Alas another week had passed. Well didn’t really had much time posting any blog msgs coz kinda busy.. Hahhah. Today got time so y not rite. So far it have been one pressurizing week for me. Well got back for work from my off’s on Wednesday. Finally finished unpacking all my stuffs in my new bunk. Kinda feeling really fuck up with my new bed heheh.. Generally the springs are mostly gone. So everytime when I sleep on the bed my mattress will seem to get sucked in. Imagine a water bed replace it with normal sponge. Been trying to get along with the new guys a bit better. Well before joining my battalion HQ things can be very quiet between me and the new medics. Finish planning the duty forecast for August. Few points seems to worry me these few days. Firstly the new guys seems to have some attitude problems. They tend to take things on their own hands and tend to piss me off by that. Well they piss me off on Thursday by sleeping in the bunk after lunch break. They also tend to slack around. Well I am in a dilemma whether to be strict or to play along with them n hoping things will change later in the future.. Well its something I am quite stress about. Next is because Shahrul got a letter from CMPB stating that he have to be transfer to a new vocation. He will no longer be a medic coz of his PES status. He kinda feeling low till Friday when he heard the news dat he had to change vocation but do not need to be transfer out from the medical center.. Somethin that everyone wishes for heeheh. Lastly still trying to get the hang of being a 2IC. So much things to know heheh. Well IQA is also around the corner. So have to werk doubly hard to get a gd record for our IQA. Well my dispensary department is about 90% prepared for it but the rest of the departments still in shaky gounr. Cant blame them they are still new.. This is like the first for most of them heheh. Well hope everything turn out fine later. Hehehe I went back to my Bravo bunk last Thursday.. Kinda&nbsp; miss that place a lot.. Although its only about 1 week since I left the place but I guess my heart is still there.. That used to be my place of joy and sorrow. My favourite bed heheh which is far much comfortable than even my bed at home hahha. Well I sat there for about half an hour admiring and thinking about the fond memories heheh.. Going to miss it a lot but well sooner or later things have to go on&nbsp; J Okie dokie have to go to bed now got my SPEC 2 course briefing in SMM tomorrow heheh chiao!!

      Ahhh yess heheheh finish painting my room at last.. Never really took dat long anyway heheh. Well finish the laundry n dishes left with folding the clothes for mum&nbsp;and wash the fans n later in the evening cook rice for everyone :P Its so much fun to do werk without so much stress n ppl barking at u hahhaah. Well made myself strawberry watermelon honey juice heheh as a token of my appreciation of my hard werk heheh. Job well done.. Well slacking for a while now :P Well checked my mail just now. Well somebody really did their werk ehheh. Well i was enquiring the organisation on a course on Computer systems engineering that they offered. The course is being certified by some university in United Kingdom but not as well known as Oxford , Cambridge n bla bla bla.. Well they really answered all the question including the ones about whether the govt recognise the cert.. :) Well the onli problem now is M..O..N..E..Y... The thing dat always either give me pleasure or usually lots of problems...Well dont get dat much of money currently due to the national service.. Well got to wait till i am werking an hopefully then i be able to pay up for further studies.. I dont know y but since i got into poly i am really into studying.. Well i guess i am matured enough n for see that future would be really bleak without papers in Singapore.. I had always been wanting to further my studies but its usually money problems hold me back.. I cant depend on my parents coz i guess my two other siblings will be going for tertiary studies in years to come..Damn those lucky rich blokes n bitches... Sometime u can just see all these ppl they can just waste their time not studying coz they know at the end of the day they know their parents can support them or even sent them to another skool just coz they got lots of money... While as for us who are always motivated to study to persue our dreams always fall short coz of lack of Money..Well at times i wonder where is the fairness in this... Well i wonder how my future will turn out to be.. really want to study...Y CANT I STUDY WHEN I STILL WANT TO...Y ISSIT HARD FOR ME TO PERSUE MY DREAMS...Money makes ppl kill,cheat,rob,hynotised,break the relationship and lots more i wonder seriously y at the first place MONEY&nbsp;was created... Well if i followed what i planned i might not be able to persue my dreams.. After NS gonna werk, support family a bit coz my parents are old,get married... Well by then i wonder i still got the motivation to study or even have the time.. So much commetment when issit time for myself really.. Well this is life.. U got to follow its course coz u are fated..  &nbsp;  i read somewhere someone says..."Dont let life discourage you.. Everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was".. Well so far that seems to be my only motivation.. I must presevere coz i know that if i werk very hard nhard enough then one day wat ever that was dream could be a reality. Well got to carry on with me werk chiao!!

      NIZAM, the hereditary title of the reigning prince of Hyderabad (q.v.) in India, derived from an Arabic word meaning order, or administration. The same word is found in Nazim, applied to the Nawab of Bengal, and in Nizamat, the old term for criminal jurisdiction. Nizam-ul-Mulk (= administrator of the kingdom) was the title of Asaf Jah, the founder of the dynasty, a very able soldier and minister of the court of Aurangzeb, who was appointed governor of the Deccan in 1713, and established his independence before his death in 1748. hahaha guess there seems to be a Nizam empire long before i was born.. Heheh no wonder love to command and conquer. To control and to preserve heheh.. It runs through royal blood from India.. Well my fore farther's came from india.. Well generally my grandmama is an indian heheh.. Well dat links rite heheeh GOD KNOWS !!!  &nbsp; Vindicated -&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink freed   urlLink from   urlLink any   urlLink question   urlLink of   urlLink guilt ; " urlLink is   urlLink absolved   urlLink from   urlLink all   urlLink blame "; " urlLink was   urlLink now   urlLink clear   urlLink of   urlLink the   urlLink charge   urlLink of   urlLink cowardice  &nbsp; Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerized and I'm so hypnotized And I am&nbsp;captivated &nbsp; I am Vindicated  I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed &nbsp;But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  &nbsp; So clear Like the diamond in your ring &nbsp;Cut to mirror your intentions  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of it has caught my eye  And rendered me so isoloated I'm so motivated  I am certain now that i am {Chorus}  &nbsp; So turn Up the corners of your lips  Part them and feel my finger tips  Trace the moment, fall forever  Defense is paper thin  Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current  So let me slip away (3x)  So let me slip against the current and let me slip away  {Chorus}  &nbsp; Slight hope It dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption

Its not that i wish to make a big fuss or tryign to compare me with ppl.. For me i really give everythin to a relationship.. Not trying to brag but well i go over everything to get to wat i want even if it kills me.. BUt ppl ard me just dont do the same.. Well okie skool starts quite well for Baby.. She got a new skool, friends , environment and etc.. But somethin doesn't change n dat is me... Well suppose to watch King Arthur rite but well we haven't.. Reason is well on Fri i just do not know where to go coz i told Baby that maybe we should watch it on Saturday coz able to watch it with me bro too coz he wants to watch it too. On well she got piss off or got so werked up n start scolding for me and as far as i concern I M NOT IN THE WRONG!!!! This always happens since the day she start skool.. She is always so bz, tired and cant stop whinning coz she is tired.. Well in the werl she can be the only soul who is damn tired.. N when she is tired i be the victim!!! Well just let fri past then as wat i told yesterday i suffered food poisoning and fever on sat morning.. Well so weak so sick but well pushed myself to camp and then helped out with the house cleaning... N not to brag i really ate my medicine and with a strong heart n weak body carry myself to Tampines where i went to Baby's house to sent her fruits coz she is also sick with the same problem.. Fed her.. I was asked to go home at abt 11.. Just giving the reason that her dad is ard n its not gd to stay out late.. Sigh... If just she is tired just tell me earlier.. Maybe after i fed her i could have gone home.. Well she have to pick the time to be 11.. OH HOW FORGETFUL IT IS NOT TO REMEMBER THAT PPL IN CHANGI AIRPORT FINISHES THEIR JOB AT 11 AND THE BUS WILL BE PACKED N DAT I HAVE TO STAND WITH THIS WEAK BODY ALL THROUGH THE JOURNEY... HOW THOUGHTFUL!!!! Sigh... Really piss me off..Cant sleep the whole nite n cant stop thinkin how sad life can be.. When i m tired or even sick i can push myself to do many things for her.. but when she is tired or sick she really make it like as though the werl gonna come to an end... Sigh... Well it is girls...BUT WELL GIRLS WILL ALWAYS BE GIRLS COZ IF THEY DONT GROW UP THEN THEY WILL NEVER BE A LADY OR WORST STILL A MUM!!! SUCKS... Sunday was really piss of mith her with me dad n ppl who annoys me while i m cleaning up my room.. Hate it when dad does werk in the house.. Not trying to say bad things but well thats him.. He does a bit of werk his mouth will go a long way.. Pissing off ppl ard him.. He keeps on asking me do this do that.. Well i say i will do.. I have my own way of doing things.. N if it concerns my own stuffs than i will prioritize the things to run in sequence n smoothly.. He keeps on insisting n insisting... Wats his problem... If he learn to do just his things quietly n not pissing ppl off i tink ppl will be more happy to help him.. Dats the problem he doesn't know how to wait.. When he wants somethin to be done then it have to be done...or else then he makes a lot of noice.. There is a thing call priority... Which come first , second n so on....Well need to paint my room today and guess help out mum with the laundry later.. Then need to study up on Dispensering (my new job) in camp..Well text Baby in the morning telling her to maybe come by my place to meet up for a while.. Msg her at 5.45 am in the morning coz thought she will wake up at her usual time at 6am.. Fine she overshot n woke up at 7am n she read the msg.. She cant turned up coz i told her last minute n dat she needs to prepare breakfast... Sigh... Well if she rush a bit n leave her place at maybe 7.30 am she can reach here bout 8am which at the same time she can ask me maybe to prepare breakfast for her.. If she just bothered to call.. Well if u go to Bishan by Sengkang the earlier case is 40 mins n worst case is 1hr.. N if she leave my place at 9 dont u tink she will reach skool in time.. Well only god knows... Sigh.. I am really sad y i can give wat maybe 200% to a relationship but get maybe 70% back...Well maybe its just fated for me...Sigh... well got to do those laundry n start painting then..

Well slept for a while woke up ard 3++ to puke.. While sleeping i just got this urge to puke.. Damnn it was cold then coz was really raining. Lighthing and thunder did their jobs well by making it seems like Singapore just got hit by an earthquake and typhoon at one sweep... Well cant really sleep after dat.Woke up again ard 5.. This time round mum turned on the living room lights n were making lots of noises abt my bro missing NPCC uniform.. Agitated i woke up n walked like a zombie into my room. Tried to sleep but no... my fone beeps.. baby msg she kinda just woke up.. Her msg kinda irritates me but well lets not persue that.Well again trying to sleep this time my headis really feeling like shit n once again feel like puking. Toss n turn roll n roll ard the bed but just could not put myself to sleep.. The last straw came when Bro on the light to get ready to go for his NPCC shit.. Gave up... So i thought y not i finish up the duty forcast planning.. While doing halfway felt like shitting.. Well unexpectedly things get really messy.. It had to get out in both directions at one go...Damn....Well it was a bit of relieve after puking again.. Wonder wat cause it...Well finish up the schedule n dad sent me back to camp. it was then bout 8.20am Well did some shifting to the battalion hq bunk n bid my farewell to some of Bravo guys. Fell kinda sad though.. Well shifted a while then went to medical centre to reprint the forcast.. Went home after dat.. Kinda a very bad ride home.. I was holding to my dear stomach so dat it will not puke again... On the way home, called baby. She told me dat she too feel sick. same thing fever n puking due to food poisoning. Sad part is we ate entirely two different food n not even from the same place. Got home did some washing up then lay down to rest. Felt so weak...Kinda boring just laying down there.. So turned on the Playstation n played some game while resting.. Kinda fell asleep halfway..Got to sleep baby called me abt 3 to check on me.. She kinda feel bad that she scolded me when i checked on her earlier. she was sleeping n she got irritated heheh..well once again ppl disturb my slumber. Unable to sleep again after dat.. Helped dad n mum clean sis room. Her room is in total mess.. Worst than a pig farm... Still feel very weak...Call Sis to get me some watermelons. I guess i need that firstly to detoxicate another is to relieve the stomach which seems to be in a very bad state.. Cant eat other fds so just depend on the melons.Well got to be strong n take care of me baby when she sick.. Ate my panadols, melons n cool down me body in the showers n off i am to Baby's house.. Brought her some melons too heheh.. Well fed her all the melons. massage her n cuddle her to sleep :) Pity me sick baby. Well stayed with her till 11 n went home after dat.. Waited for the bus that took so long to turned up.. I was getting very dizzy n felt like puking again.. Damn...So this is how it feels when both of us got sick together heheh... Reach home relieve myself n prepare the medications for later. Wonder if i could sleep n rest peacefully tonite.. Got a whole lot of stuffs to do tomorrow.. Need to help dad with lots of house werk n maintenance..Hrmmm at the same time i m kinda feeliing really worried.. Monday is D day for mum.. Its either she lost he job or she still stay in it.. Her werkplace is cutting on cost so they clearing ppl.. Well mum have been werking there since i m young whether they will take that into consideration. Asked her dat day on wat gonna happen to her if she lose her job. She say jokingly then be house wife lor... Well she may sounds fine but i can see she is lying... She is trying not to make the household worried.. Well u knoe the times in Singapore is still quite bad.. So losing a job really means a big deal.. Wish all the best for dat.. Guess wat i m still feeling horny n cheeky.. Wonder how much longer i can hold heheh.. Well hope to get well soon.. Although as much as i want to get sick some sickness are just somethin i will dread to get.. n dat is rashes n food poisoning...

      Yawwwwwwwnnnnnn.. Rise n shine sleepy heads.ITS OFF DAY AGAIN EHEHEHE!! Just woke up from my deep slumber. Was playing playstation last nite then just suddenly dropped dead asleep hehe.dats somethin i got problem with. when i feel really tired my body just switch off from anythin dat i do n just sleep heheh. Anwyay yesterday had a bad afternoon. Went to Nee Soon again for another medic training. it was raining really heavily yesterday. when i reach there just sat n wait for not even 5 mins then the event instructor cancelled the training due to wet weather. but then the shit part is its like 45 mins to the start of the lesson.. By 1230 the rain subside... then i was thingkin if she would have just wait till now which is 15 mins from original planned start time, the trip to nee sonn would not be wasted... Damn!!! Piss me off seh.. This is the third time in less than a week thant this happens.. Shit!!! The nxt shit thing is the vehicle we indent to pick us back to camp never really came... The driver n his vehicle went AWOL i tink... fuck him... Then as stupid as it may seems we took a cab back to camp....(which is to say $$ is not refundable) Came back to medical centre... called my snr medic to inform him of my duty this sat... How the heck would i be in 2 places at 1 time. i m having duty this sat n at the same time i have to report at kranji camp at 2pm for another medic training... Simply fuck up!!! I still wonder if sat they will screw things up again... My senior medic told me to just switch ard my duties.. I tell myself when would i able to do my weekend duty... if i were to switch it to this sunday then i would not be coming back for 2 weeks then.. If i were to push it the following week then i be doing it rite after i finish my Ex. Mousedeer... I cant it push to the 24 of july coz i m having some family function on dat day... Wat the fuck... this really piss me off.. If he regard me to be 1 of the best medic in 2SIR then he should give me a bit of respect n leeway... If he were to attached me to so much training to make our unit look gd then he should provide me with a better schedule with my duties... dats the least i m asking for... I m sick n tired of helping ppl who in the end doesnt seems to appreciate the work done.. He had forgotten that BRAVO coy is the real backbone of his medical centre.. Without us always helping them do all last minute stuffs then he will always be in deep shit.. Dont let it come to a stage where i shall boycott him n the medical centre.. Alpha is not always there... Charlie onli a few would support.. N if we dont support then he go eat his own shit... But well dats wat happen in the day though. I met my baby in the evening.. Went for dinner at Harbour Front.. Just love the mee soto there.. but reach there i tink it might just not be filling enough to eat just the mee soto.. So i ordered mee goreng n mutton soup instead.. which is to say 1 of the best soup in singapore.. After dinner we went down to orchard. hang ard there do some window shopping n then flatter with more fds at Taka food fest. heheh bought lots of fd last nite heheh. Hopefully today will turn up well. Fetchign my baby from skool later at 11 then maybe following her frien get a hp. after dat still unsure yet but hopefully turned out gd :P cheers

      While listening to a track called Remember me by Josh Groban and Tanja Tzarovsk from TROY, i decided to post new msg here hahha. Never really get dat much sleep from last nite. Well basically slept at ard 4 n woke up at 6 to go for my AED course in Nee Soon. Dad sent me there as he was en - route to his werkplace. Reach there at abt 740 met my fellow medic Nurul n Daniel.. In we go n sit we did to the not so comfortable seat in one of the lecture theatres offered in SMM (School Of Military Medicine). While we waited for the the other medics from other units to turn up, a nominal roll was passed ard to check for attendance n certification acknowledgement. I just got this weird feeling dat somethin will go wrong today.. Somehow...Somewhere... When the nominal roll finally reach me, i was really shocked to see that NONE!! of the medics from my unit is supposed to attend today's course. Well taking iniative i just wrote my name down n pass ard. Well After lunch we are suppose to have both teory n practical test to pass the course... As the instructors countercheck the nominal roll again they found out they actually have EXTRA personnel whom would be unable to participate in this course.. The course is limited to 25 men per day.. So we were "KINDLY" asked to leave coz even if we stay they cant accomodate us for test nor certify us... So we just say thanx n left the place feeling disgusted hahah!!! Well well well... wat a way to crash the day... Wat poor planning my senior medic have... This isn't the first time dis happen.. Not to say countless times dis happen.. Damn I think i might just ended up disown my senior medic soon hahahah.. Well Early in the morning i got a really great kickstart to the day by listening to Perfect 10. The 2 crazy dj's Sheik Haikel n Daniel Ong was full of crap that worth listening to n not to say will put a smile to ur face. Well today's major topic is wat u will keep in ur BLACKOUT kit at hm. :) (Well this topic start coz of the recent major blackout that hit many parts in Singapore..

      Arghhhhh another tragic day… Wat fuck does it comes to dis… WELL BLOG I GUESS THE ONLY WAY TO RELIEVE MYSELF IS TO WRITE ON U..COZ THERE IS NOT POINT TALKING ANYMORE… U KNOW Y PPL GO WAR COZ WHEN ONE BECOMES HOT HEADED N DO NOT WANT TO LISTEN TO EXPLANATION N Getting IMPATIENT… Well my Baby told me yesterday dat we need to go to talk.. So before I slept last nite, I ask her whether to call her or not. Then she say she call me in 10 mins time. Okie fine.. call came we didn’t really talk much apart from her keep on saying oh I don’t feel like talking to u bout the things anymore.. Here I am giving a chance for everythin to clear up there she was making things more “BETTER”… WAT FUCK LAH!!! Well put down the fone instantly then… Slept…Woke up in the morning to see a msg asking me whether I don’t find my Baby dat pleasing anymore… later part she call me so call wake me up… Well she say she wants to ask me something.. then I say okie later we talk bout it after my first parade… Oh damn wat comes after dat is very very “wonderfull” Well she ask me wats my relationship with her best frien Syikin… Well I say nothing merely friens… Then she was well scolding n interrogating me worst than a cop the whole time.. Then accuses starts to come by n I wonder myself where things go wrong for me… Well lets start elaborating things… 1 fateful day I was really feeling horny… then I was surfing n surfing then I saw something that was written on syikin biodata.. Well she just describe of a gal whom is sex crazy n just wants more.. wat more when I myself knows her lifestyle from my Baby herself… SO well as horny as I m I thought y not gave a comment abt her biodata.. Nothin more n nothing less… Well from my werds I said, “well ur erotic behaviour is really making my mind go really crazy if u know wat i mean :P hehe” on 18 july.. Well she then responded well somthin I anticipate from someone’s bestfrien. She say eh u hana’s guy rite?? Don’t try to act anything funny kz… n well I replied her with” ok :) nah not trying to get any ideas with u just telling u aje wat i m thinking :) heheh “ on the same day again… Well after dat she never msg me till one fateful day n dat is on 24 july where she ask me a question when I answered “yeah sure ask me anythin. no prob if u keep it between us” I keep on telling her if she want to say anything then keep it between us.. Well dats the only thing I can do.. Everythin have to be done in secret nowadays coz well I just lost my freedom to do anything since the day I m attached to my Baby…sadly…sigh… Then she ask me have I ever thought to have threesome with her n my Baby… then I answered” yeahhh eheheh all the time but well she doesnt want it so heheh we have to go by her way :P” coz well its always my fantasy to have a threesome esp if everyone knows each other.. Well its just a fantasy which I also guess have to be control…But well I told her my decision all depends with my Baby if she is not fine with it then well we don’t do it then..  then well we exchange no. coz most of the time I m very bored in camp… well how can we say… finish werk at 5.. then after dat is nothing n everyday is a nitesoff.. well I cant pssibly go out everyday rite.. I m not dat rich to support my own transport to go out everyday… Well I cant always go out with my Baby coz its either she is tired from skool or her parents will complain… sigh… so tell me wat u want me to do esp when I m stucked in my ns life… stuck in camp where the only entertaintment is my radio… well tell me if I m not bored… sigh…but well at the same time exchanging of no’s is just exchanging… I never plan to msg her actually.. or never have I done dat.. since the last time I msg her was on my birthday n dat was” hehehe maybe ah someday got the chance we go for a threesome :) yeah anyway name's nizam ah. thanx for ur no. anyway :)” well I donno wat I did wrong then.. the topic rose coz she ask me… we exchange no’s for just changing n not even a msg… she leads her own life n I lead my own life… never crossing over any line I guess…  well my Baby was saying by doing so makes it like as thought I m not satisfied with her… worst still she say get a new gal who can satisfy my high sex drive or even provide me with a threesome… Well I cant blame myself for having a high sex drive rite?? Is it my fault dat I m like dat… well now is if she accommodate to my sex drives well she can talk much bout it.. Unlike last time when I ask for sex 24/7 now I try to control myself to I tink minimum 1 time a week max 2 times n well she still unhappy.. I m doing her a even gd favour by not asking too much.. usually now just masturbate myself to relief the tension… here I m trying to accommodate to her and change there she is complaining.. well I guess maybe I m asking for too much… wondering… sigh…a threesome is always a fantasy for me.. well I m the sort who loves to experiment new things n doing lots of things.. well I m a sex freak wat do u expect… Well maybe others don’t understand me dats y they can say so much… oh fuck just talking abt this piss me off… well I really donno wats her problem… she say she like me to suggest new things n when I suggest she don’t like… wat kinda crap is dat… I guess the one having prob is her not me… Well she say saying y in the whole werl dat I must chose her best frien… then I say wat wrong with dat… she say y not find other slut then she will not make so much noise… well dis is not the first time I hear these werds coming out…whether its her best frien or any other gal wat fuck she will still either way make it sound the same… dat she is unhappy bout it… oh yeah n when comes bout her she refuse to be compared to anyone… but when comes to me well I always have to accept… she say whether I like her doing the same thing with my friens… First thing first does my frien have a high sex drive like syikin? Secondly does she have the same fantasy like me… well if the ans is yes then that’s full of bullshit!!! I dono her yesterday k… As much as she hates her enemies is as much she hate sex… only recently dat she seems to be a bit more open coz he see ppl ard her doing more than her… sigh… welll do whatever u want coz I don’t fucking care… I wonder for a 23yr old guy I m the most pitiful guy.. so much problem all freedom constraint to the little bit… I guess these is the onli things I have left which I can write freely.. maybe this also will be taken off soon… sigh… LISTEN HERE THIS IS MY FUCKING OPINION N MY OWN SPACE N U CALL FUCKINGLY OVER MY DEAD FILTHY BODY DAT I WILL GIVE THIS UP… U CAN SHIT AT MY REPUTATION TO UR BELOVED FRIENDS ABT HOW I M N I FUCKING CARE LESS ABT WAT THEY TINK BOUT ME COZ THIS IS MY FUCKING LIFE N NO ONE KNOWS IT BETTER THAN I DO… DON’T TRY TO JUDGE ME FOR MY FLAWS COZ U DONNO HOW MUCH I HAVE GONE THROUGH FOR OTHER N DAT INCL U!!!

Never misses the fireworks life except for recently.. well my grand’s place is in Beach road nearby to National stadium so u can wonder why I say I view it live hehehe.. This year is the 20th year of total defence. Well I guess evey Singapore should have the pillars of total defence embedded inside them. We have always been werking together hand in hand among various race to achieve thus far n we must continue these way till the end of time :P For the soil here is our soil.. The land we learnt to call home n we shall always protect it J Well no matter where u go u will always end up thinking of home. Coz Singapore is always special.

World is crushing down as I cry in my heart.. Well the only way to release my tension is to release my soul to my faithful blog while screaming my hearts out to the tune of this song… Well shaiful I love u for as much as I hate u.. Coz in this life we are fated to be together my dear self of  23 yrs we been together… Sadly…  Can you leave me here alone now I don't wanna hear you say That you know me That I should be Always doin what you say Cuz I'm tryin to get through today And there's one thing I know  I don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out I Don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin Don't wanna talk this one out I won't let you bring me down Cuz I knowI don't wanna think about you Don't wanna think about you  When I wake up here tomorrow Things will never be the same Cuz I won't waitCuz you won't change And you'll always be this way Now I'm gonna get through today And there's one thing i know  I don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out I don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin Don't wanna talk this one outT his time I won't let you bring me down Won't let you shut me out This time I know I don't wanna think about you  Run away Run away Running as fast as I can Run away Run away I'll never come back again Run away Run away  Don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out Don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna talk this one out  I don't wanna think about you Think about me Don't wanna figure this out (figure this out)  I don't wanna think about you Or think about nothin Don't wanna talk this one out This time I won't let you bring me down (bring me down) Won't let you shut me out (shut me out) This time I know I don't wanna think about you  Run away Run away I don't wanna think about you Run away Run away I don't wanna think about you Run away Run away I don't wanna think about you

Well went to treat my family for breakfast today. Well it isn’t really my great idea to go today… Well its kinda like a “force” thingy.. Well my mum was actually the one suggesting me treating them… Hrmm its not I m making a big fuss for treating them but well I guess now is not the rite time to treat them… Well I still in the financial stabilizing process where I actually I was planning to clear all my bills this mth so that by nxt mth well I can start having some money for myself…Its have been an ongoing thing for me to not having $$… Sigh… well treat them then.. I cant really say no rite to my own family.. So well I spent more than wat I bargain for.. Well I m the sort who once start to spent money for my family or loved ones would not know when to stop.. Well got home start to do some medical center paper werk.. Try to drag the time as much as possible to let the day pass by quickly which it doesn’t seems to be… Sigh.. Well I really wished that I was fine today but well I guess dat need lot of werk… No one seems to be bothered much bout my life… Sigh… Hope to watch fireworks today but well my baby chose to go with her friens.. Well from wat I remember correctly I never say I do not want to go to watch fireworks.. wat I remember saying was insyaallah when it mean goin to go if nothing gone wrong.. Well I guess it quite normal ah every year seems to be the same thing… Except for last year which I was at the NDP parade itself I never fail to watch the fireworks every year up till the time when I m in a relationship with my Baby… Sadly sigh… Every year planned but always end up quarrel on the day… Sigh… well I guess I got to wait for nxt year though..hopefully I got to see it…Well she chose to go with her friens then let it be ah… I don’t want to stop her in anything she want to do ah… sick n tired of dat already coz she can agree with u 1 moment but talk abt in behind u… or worst still annoy u time n again till u agree…sigh… whatever lah…Well another weekend spoil n another occasion thrashed…Well going back camp soon…sigh….

      Its Friday again n well after a long week it will come to a close.. Well felt quite tired actually today.. donno y… Well really miss my gal so I really wanna meet her.. Only problem is I do not know where to go.. Sigh.. Singaproe is so small.. I wonder y last time I had so much place to go.. Maybe coz now due to $$ constraint.. Well since then I usually do not want to go out to avoid getting bored n piss off after dat… SO I ask Baby to decide where to go.. As usual as she is nowadays, she start shouting and scolding me for no reasons again… Well finally after doing a thorough area cleaning I finally set my self ready to go out with Baby.. Not knowing where to head coz she herself cant decide.. Well didn’t really had a gd day at werk today so I thought y not cheer me up at the same time do something dat we both enjoy.. N dat is to eat.. I suggest to my baby lets go to the doughnut shop which we love in Takashimaya.. Reach there I saw a toy fare.. Well the multi purpose area in Taka never fail to bring a smile out of me since last time.. If its not fd or toys u can sure there are other things like clothes or something else.. Well I bought 8 GI Joe figurines for only $20 somethin money well spent.. Well I guess I want to start collecting toys again something dat I always dream offs since last time.. Maybe after start werking maybe I can get swords instead. :P Well bought some pastries too from one of our fav pastry shop in Taka.. heheh Thought maybe we can go Our fav place to eat it n dats Changi Airport.. Took a bus there.. Bus was pack n both of us kinda feel tired.. So basically slept through the whole journey… Well Baby woke up angry n annoyed for no reason.. She is insisting us to go home coz she say I was tired.. While the fact was she is the one tired… Sigh cant believe in her werds nowadays.. It always carry a different meaning… Well angry n displeased well we head for home then… She went home I went home n fix up the comp for a while b4 going to sleep… Sigh a perfect day ruined again…

      After waiting for very long n after 4 different occasion I am finally a certified Automatic External Defibrillator giver accredited by the School Of Military Medicine.. Not as if I failed in the last 4 occasions.. Its just that on all the previous time I turned up for dat my name isn’t in the nominal role. Well finally name was there n not wasting the chance.. Dad gave me a lift to SMM in the morning. Reach there saw few of my ex- platoon mates from SMM.. To tink how small the infantry core is worst still the medics in a combat unit is more smaller.. Well chatted with those guys n tell great stories of my time since I left SMM abt a year ago.. Well the course was really a complicating one.. More complicated than CPR coz it got more contraindications and also more steps.. But well it gets easier once u got the hang of it. Like CPR if u follow the sequence nothing will go wrong hehehe. Well come the test I was kinda afraid but feelin bit of confident to pass it.. The teory paper was tricky n the practical was superb.. The point is I showed confidence in doing it. Hahha well follow all the protocols n list out all the contraindications.. Got a scare in the earlier part of the practical test coz I forgotten to insert the airway guerdal.. Well dat happens when u stress rite hehehe. Well guess pass it with flying colours !!! Well spent almost $7 on food today.. Bought mee rebus in the morning n banana fried platter while had mee soto n 2 curry puffs for lunch. Well they kinda increase the cost though.. MUST not spent too much in SMM later once I go for my spec course… Don’t wanna waste money n grow fat again rite hehehe… Well the daughter of the stall holder seems to look very sweet hahaha Head down to Sim Lim after dat with Baby following me. She looks very nice n pretty today. Heheh Miz her badly indeed.. Never really had the chance to spent quality time together dat much nowadays coz she is either tired or quarrel with me or coz I m also tired at times… Sigh… pitiful.. Well go to Sim Lim change my hard disk then went down had ice cream together. She had cholote chip ice cream while I had strawberry ripple ehehe. Well its very nice feeling dat I kinda miss nowadays… Well Baby sent me home today coz I said I wanna fix up my comp… Well kinda had a gd trip back home but a very short one.. I miss her lots…. Well went home had a quick dinner n straight to the pc.. Well got the chance to fix halfway though coz not much time to troubleshoot.. at the same time rushing to go back camp… Well waited for the bus which never came so had to take cab again back to camp.. Such a waste of $$…

      Well very bad nite last nite.. First cant sleep well coz the weather was really warm last nite.. Second was coz I got a nightmare abt my Encik.. Well sad to say bump into him yesterday evening before book out.. He was asking me when will I clean my rifle.. Its not wat okie,… I had cleaned my rifle everythin but the only thing is he just too strict bout his checks.. Its not wat ah but I guess the next time I clean the rifle I tink I have to bring a vacuum cleaner along coz I got to suck every single dust from parts which u cant even dismantle.. When I say dust its really dust not DIRT!!! Fuck him man…He is really giving me nightmares.. Well when I don’t get enough sleep well then my day will really turn out sucky.. lots of chaos happen in medical center today… Got really angry with Charlie coy medic.. He never did his part as a medic worst still a coy medic… Rather than do his job as a medic he did COS duties… Fuck him man for agreeing it… Coz of dat the whole batallion medics have to start do guard duties n COS duties… Wat the fuck… I m the one who then have to cover for each other ass… I do not give any piece of respect with this kind of ppl… Talk to my MO regarding the matter n asked him to insist that those other duties is not for us…Unfair for medics to deal with so many regimental duties…Fuck him for being so stupid… He is a SGT who have no balls to fight for his men rights for the correct reasons…Dimwit… Had a busy day today n as soon as I can leave I rush my way to bunk n off I m out rushing to Simei to meet my Baby n Kimmie from the Vet.. Reach to her place watch tv for a while then suddenly I fell asleep… Well cant blame me coz I was so tired.. never get much sleep anyway… Slept till 12 then was nag away to home by my Baby.. I donno y but nowadays it seems she is not thoughtful about me once she get tired.. While I was sleeping she studied for her test… Once she grows tired she starts scolding me for no reason n say tomorrow she have to wake up early n bla bla bla black shit… well was semi-conscious en-route home.. my head really felt very heavy… But well I still got home safely.. Felt very fresh so thought of fixing up my new hard disk.. Test n test n finally proven that the hard disk dat I bought was faulty… Well going Sim Lim tomolo…

      Ahhh rise n shine don’t wanna be late for the blood drawing for my Bravo guys.. Didn’t had a gd sleep last nite after the sad incident last nite.. Well brush that aside today is D-day for me heheh either I maintain my reputation or tarnish it badly… Woke up early then rush back to bunk to have a gd cold shower.. As this water flows down there it will too be my sorrow.. For today without concentration I will fail…n a failure is not my agenda today…When I came back to medical center I saw how nicely n organized Bravo men could be.. Like wat was planned they followed orders…J Nicely done.. Draw blood successfully on 4 / 5 guys.. heheh the last one was not enough blood heheh.. Well dat cheer me up at the same time I was so happy that well at least I maintain my reputation… My baby was making a fuss about wat happen last nite.. Well wat the heck.. Going to follow her send Kimmie to the vet later coz she had developed some skin infection.. Well days goes by n still waiting for my baby to ask me abt my prob… but well once again it never came… Played soccer in the evening with my fellow medics.. Its either I cant concentrate or I just lost my skills in playing…hahah well I tink the second one seems more comfy heheh,, well moreover I wasn’t feeling well today.. kinda had a bad headache since morning.. Asked one of my medics to give me a ride to tamp coz I was in a rush to go to tamp to fetch both my Baby n Kimmie to the vet.. Well I donno whether it my  feeling or issit really I should have ask dat guy to gave me a ride.. Well his face change since then… I feel really bad n feel really wrong to trouble him.. Sigh… I donno I tink I m feeling like shit these 2 weeks…Fuck!! Well still got a ride n I was very thankful coz I reach Tamp on time.. Went to Afghanistan to look at the hamster to see how much it cost. Bought a bun for myself to fill my empty stomach.. Fetch Kimmie n my Baby n off to the vet.. Found out that u have to make an appointment first before going there.. SO got no choice have to make the appointment which happens to be tomolo.. Helped to carry Kimmie n felt like I was a dad n dat was my sick child I was carrying. Ehheh funny thing is she was very quiet all the way. Maybe coz  she is a home cat which never travel apart from the corridor outside the house.. heheh look at her quiet n pitiful face puts a smile to my face heheh.. Had dinner at Banquet.. ordered Fried Hor Fun.. Nice n hot just the kind I love.. Only problem is I wasn’t feeling well to enjoy it.. Felt really high coz got a bad headache.. After dinner head home to Baby’s place to rest there for a while..Baby gave me some panadol to ease the pain.. Guess I cant walk too much anymore n worried that I might just faint halfway.. Somethin that is not gd… So took cab back to camp…

      Its another work week and a very slow start actually every Monday. I was on P1 duty today.. Much to my surprise heheh for I had forgotten my own duty when It was me who plan it at the first place.. First thing first was shocked that my ambulance wasn’t there at the car porch… Stupid part is the driver drove it somewhere n he is uncontactable coz he just lost his hp… Wat madness is dis heheh… Abt 0830 the Alpha guys came down for their Post Taiwan Trip HIV test… Was kinda forget bout that tooo,, Well maybe there was too much things still unsolved in my mind… Well were rushing for the preparations for the blood test booth.. Made orders for those Alpha guys to not choke the treatment room by staying in the lecture room n wait for their turn… Sadly my pleas gone down to deaf ears… Fuck them all behaving like un control lunatics…  I was very keen to draw blood coz its been a long time I last draw blood from somebody.. First reason is I wasn’t to practice my medical skills again.. I felt that as times goes by my skills are very unpolished n deteriorating very fast.. Dis is no good news especially with me going for my Spec course in 20 days time… Damn… Another reason is that I want to save my face.. I do not want to fail in drawing blood for my ex Bravo guys later tomorrow.. How disappointing can it be if the medic whom they regard very highly of failed them when they need badly… Tried n tried but after abt 5 try I still failed to draw blood successful.. I was worried and very disappointed with myself.. I was trying hard but in the end I just have to weep deep inside me.. For as a medic I felt I have fail very badly.. A medic without his skills isn’t a medic…  I feel very low.. I search for some comfort by msg my Baby but well dat goes down the drain too.. I told her abt me feeling sad n low abt the blood test.. Rather than comfort me she just talk to me bout how she was piss off with Su her frien for going to skool without her.. Well not to say bad but this is pay back.. She did dat last week so I guess its pay back time.. Waited n waited but well my pleas just go down the drain.. Well as for me my fellow medics gimme a helping hand when I need them to be.. They let me practise on them.. In the end I made abt 2 successful blood drawing today… In return I let them play with my hands.. I don’t mind getting poke for practise of fun… its just the games medics just love… Well although felt a bit better I was still feelin low.. Of all the ppl who I want to comfort me the most imp one didn’t show any signs of dat… Wasn’t sure wat time my baby finishes class I made the point to call her at abt 5++.. No response from her… She call me back at bout 6 saying she didn’t hear the phone n she will be going to the doc for her medical problem on running with her mum later.. Had to end the call soon coz I on one side shouting to her but for her side she still cant hear.. Annoying as it is I got to bear with it till I get her a new hp… Soon… She told me that later once after she got back from the clinic she will call me.. Was playing Winning Eleven 7 when suddenly my Baby called at abt 845pm.. I told her later I will call her back coz I m halfway through the game.. She said ok coz she herself going to have her dinner.. She told me she will call me after her dinner.. She tried to call me but well I was out of range.. My medical center is so old that little reception can pass through it.. As soon as I got a msg warning to inform me dat my baby call, I quickly call her back.. No answer… Then she msg me stating she goin to bed first coz she feeling weak after some injection.. ok then I don’t wish to disturb her coz doing so will just make things worst… Once again she tried calling me abt 10 but I was out of range..again… As soon  I receive the msg I quickly call her back.. But guess she put her fone to silence.. No ans so I made the point to call her at her hm.. Wat I got was an unreasonable scolding n yelling.. I was scold coz she cant hear me.. then I try to explain about no reception n she keep on yelling n bla bla bla n slammed the fone… Sigh.. things just have to get worst rite… sigh…

      Today is the last day of my bungalow function.. Had a hard time yesterday trying to get Satays.. Went to my old place to get them but they were close yesterday.. wondering y… Roam ard Bedok but only when I search in Bedok central that I manage to get my hands on those Satay’s… Was surpriced Wak Din’s stall sells Satay.. They don’t used to sell that in the past… Reach the bungalow almost 5.. Helped out my parents with the preparations such as lay out the food and paper plates n cups..Ppl start coming abt 6pm.. Was kinda busy that many of my relatives came by.. But kinda sad that my grandma wasn’t there. She kinda not feeling well. Hrmmm… If just I could do something for her…Sigh. Well Baby was there too.. Glad she was there coz it really mean a lot to me.. But well I guess she don’t feel comfy abt her presence there.. I wonder y since everyone treats her like family.. such as my aunt,my family n etc… Well I kinda was stucked with her the whole time.. Didn’t manage to mingle much with my family… I kinda feel very disappointed coz its not everyday I have a family occasion.. I felt that they might tink I am snobbish of not entertaining them… Its my family who organize it n they did their part of turning up…But I did not do my part.. Was very sad indeed.. Then my baby was kinda making a fuss about her not feelin comfy n dat she wants to go home at 8… Sigh… The least that was could happen is she not doing this to me… Well I don’t want her to go home dat soon coz later wat other will say.. Here I am trying to promote a gd impression abt her there she is not helping a bit.. Well I neglect my family members for that… Keep on taking food for her so that she can stay a bit longer… I cant really blame her nor angry with her.. coz she having her PMS n well things always get very ugly when dis comes… Ah fuck…Well finally at 1030 my gal give the pack up sign.. Well my cuz ask me whether he can give me n my gal a lift back coz he intends to go back his ciggies… Well with a thick face putting a masquerade of happy face I accompany my Baby to bid farewell to everyone.. Well sent her back then went to Chai Chee but then my cuz say he forgotten to bring along his keys…Head back to Pasir Ris then.. Reach there back but noticed everyone had left.. Kinda sad I wasn’t able to at least mingle with my family a bit.. I really felt very low indeed like as though a body which lost its soul.. Wat makes matter worst is dat my aunties n cuz gave me lots of birthday gifts.. Didn’t really expect that to happen coz like I say we are having a family occasion n not celebrating my birthday… I really felt very disappointed…Damnn…ah wat the heck have to look forward for the coming week.. A brand new week.. Played with the PS the wholemorning.. Helped me cheer up a bit but still felt like shit… Well got some $$ now.. Went to Sim Lim to get a new hard disk coz my current one is too small for me… Reach home abt 9 after paid for me mum her stuffs.. Didn’t got any time to repair my PC so well just head to camp.. Well before I go I wish to say thank you to all my aunt n cuz who make an effort to make this family function a successful one. Hope they ate lots n enjoy themselves.. I m very sorry for unable to treat them well as guest but hope I can mend my ways n repay their kindness someway or another.. Thank you very much..
