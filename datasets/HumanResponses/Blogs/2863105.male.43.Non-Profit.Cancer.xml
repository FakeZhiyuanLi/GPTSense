      Ito ang panimula sa aking pagsusulat sa aking sariling wika upang mas lalong maintindihan ng ibang mambabasa lalo sa mga Pilipino na nakatira sa ibang bansa o di kaya'y mga banyaga na gustong matuto ng Wikang Filipino.  Higit sa lahat ang mga kuwentong aking isasalaysay ay naging bahagi na rin ng aking karanasan at nais ko ring ibahagi ang mga ito sa aking mga anak, mga apo at ang mga apo ng mga anak ng aking mga apo hanggang sa kadulo-duluhan ng aking buong angkan.  Kung anumang kamalian sa pagsusulat ay sa akin po iyon at walang iba na puwedeng sisisihin.

      A thing of the past is also a thing in the future though the dimension of its occurrence is different from the timeline of its event.  Anger is a sign of immaturity and the fall of prematured wisdom.  To work with honesty is a blessing to the Lord.  The first work of dishonesty is the beginning of all corruptions.  There is only one way to win every heart and mind of the people: to work with an honest labor.

      There is one thing that we need to think about...our thoughts.  The first pain is lasting, and pains that come last are very disturbing.  Laws are made for you to see the reflection of your bad images.  Nothing works when nothing is done for something that never have been done for nothing.  We seemed to be amazed of something that we sometimes believed to be worthy of wondering.

      Creativity begins from the space of imagination drawn by the results of work.  When a man stands eloquently for a righteous order, his line can be seen upturned by the people who knew him well.  Wisdom is the master of man’s destiny drawn by the portals of knowledge making the man different of its own.  An expounded opinion derived from the synthesis of a given order can forestall the hypothesis of undiscovered theory.  Deviation from the common view is like extracting gold from the mouth of an elephant or silver from the claws of the tiger.  Politics is the collective bargain of what can be promised and what the people can gain.  In every game you’ve played, don’t count how many times you’ve lost.  Instead, count the number of times you’ve given your opponent the hardest encounter ever had from your very best efforts.  In every success, we don’t have to draw a line that demarcates ourselves from the failures of others.  In trimming the edge of arguments, skillfully know the things that you would like to gain out of it.  There is only one man who will never learn --- the man who forget about himself at all.  Impatience is an engrafted view from hatred and an overflowing disaffection of the human spirit.  The way to a woman’s heart is a truthful talk generously expressed from the eyes of a loving heart.  The law concealing the intention of its maker belies the veracity of its contents.  Tolerance in friendship is unlimited, but sometimes friends outdone the limits of tolerance.  In all of our experiences that we have, we can always consider that pains in the heart are the best teachers of reasons in wisdom.  When the world will filled with honorable men, you could never imagine what will happen to the future.  We don’t have to compare a pretty face to an ugly one for both have the same attributes of beauty that can conquer a heart.  No matter what have you gone through with your studies,  always remember that the basic foundation of life which you could prove its worth is Patience.  A piece of advice:  Do not spoil friends who will give you the unexpected time of humiliation, rather choose a friend who can give you lessons to live by and to be with.  Nepotism in the government thrives when the functional elements of its instrumentalities wear the crown of their alterego by resentment.  We virtually give ideas but not the usual conclusions.  When we try to conclude, it will be very amazing that we could not even believe it to ourselves.  The house with silent atmosphere can be differed to a silent river flowing deep into the ocean of uncertainty.  Sometimes, let us not adapt the way we thought it is, but the way we think that it is and will be.  Conclusions differ greatly with judgment only when we put ourselves to the thought of what we should be concluding.  The decisions that we are going to make are sometimes as fatal as the storm, but gentle as the rain drops.  Actions are governed by the rules of emotions so that the reaction of our mind depends upon the acceptance of the stress.  Sometimes, the subconscious mind denounces any illicit acts of the body but unknowingly it did iniquity.  The most difficult thing when people decide is the way and means on how they would make up certain decisions.  When people use peace as an instrument of war, the factor to decide usually comes from the footsteps of their ancestors having no traces but only dreams to follow.  A pauper who knows to handle the ways of life is worthy than a king who awaits the advices of his Council.  Big wars come from smaller ones depicting one great cycle of silent metamorphosis of people’s awareness.  A man who is seeking something new may forget the ladder to a camel’s back and even censure wisdom to a lion’s portal.  A cup of sweetened lemonade can be resembled to a cup of sweet milk containing insatiable taste and vexation of the human spirit.  Man’s creativity comes from the oblivious space of his own wardly spirit.  Patience is one of the unique virtues of common sense and one of the probable areas of ingenuity.  The hyperbolic view of a certain synthesis comes from the unfounded baseline of extended facts.  A reason that divides can be one of the facts that connect the roads and bridges that multiply the wisdom of the human spirit.  To trim the edge of certain argument, we must be sure enough that we knew certain facts whence it began.  The law that conceals the veracity of its content can deceive the intentions of its own maker.  One win is the greatest contribution to a competition between players and never a hundred times or more.  It takes a million pains and only one great sigh needed in order to know your real friends.

       Every written words when sought from God is a living testimony of those whom He manifest as his ever great wisdom and blessings to humanity.   The true measure of a righteous man is the truthful intent and righteous goodness of his heart.  When he is not, he will surely falter. (George McKinsley)

      When a man speaks in front of many people and could not look at the eyes of those who are listening to his delivered words, there is that great tendency he's been speaking of his own folly.

      When a man looks his eyes forward, without feeling his feet touching the ground, will surely miss the mark he left behind.  There are two reasons why every person is interested to enter a race:  First, it's about the prize and fame; and the second is that it will never come again this far.  Election is a time for winding up the rusted pen for voting; and even exalts the rugged terrain of dreaming.  When one decides, everybody is the spectator of it.  Not everyone yet realized that he is one of those persons who really is meant for something he dislikes much and of everything he would not expect.  Politics is a mingling of ideas with a lot of promises, dreams, visions, and inspirations.  Most of all, it is a vineyard for the slaggard and a paradise for the witty.

      A real leader pays attention to words of experiences that draws the path of righteous endeavor.  A good leader is a good listener.  Constructive views sometimes dwells only among those who are willing to share it; while destructive views ruins the origin of it.  A clever follower always dare the master by measuring his patience.  Words of mouth delivers the piercest battle.  A real pain pierces through a hardbound rock of afflictions.  Count no hours in your work and the hours will never be counting what you have done for the day.  Impatience to every little difference results to more vaguenes of reasons.

      A man who thought of winning an election means to pull down his opponents and bring himself out to be the best among them, is a man who's been molded with the culture of corruption.  A boastful heart wins a lot of friends, but at the back of his head, an enemy is waiting to strike him down.  We gain a lot of surprises when you least expected it.  People's choice becomes sacred when out of the dungeon a hero eloquently stand by their midst; but with a corrupt leader, people becomes radical.  No one could win an election with a finger pointing at the heavens; while his heart is wearied by the burden of his foes.

      Spiritual pain kills the heart.  A loving friend always keep a promise and never falter nor find ways of evading.  The sincerest heart we could ever find is the heart of truthful brethrenhood.  No matter what it takes to succeed, never try to forget that your feet is still touching the ground.  One thing that can make your brethren happy or sad is your heart's content.  A soothing pain beats the heart.

      Cunny people with wise mind sometimes overshoot their talents of expressing their thoughts to the doubting suppositions of the simple people.  It is better to listen than to insist to be listened to.  A closed heart means a closed mind.  When simple thoughts come in a way to enter into the closed heart, it will begin to sprout like weeds to corrupt a closed mind much in going into the most darkest part of it.  When you doubt, you will surely mean no reason to listen.  Fraud is what corrupt minds insist.  Doubt is the way to a prideful circumstance of your soul.  When you see the darkest part of you, you will know that the lighter part of it is the place you first notice when you never doubted anything.  To convince a naked woman to wear her clothing is the worst part of seeing yourself in companionship with her.  Who wins an argument?...No,not one. Even those who won it fails.  The only guidance against doubt is when you see others are trusting.  Call it fraud...call it anything you want. Still you are one part of it.  When people start to doubt the government, it is as if they are doubting their own.

						   May 8.  Two days more to go. Leaders of the candidates are drawing the winning streak. Strategies formulated from the past election experience was soon to be obsolete. Voters stigma seems a burgeoning malady on the side of those who wills to win a seat for the local elective posts.  This day seems to be an never-ending analysis and decision-making process for all the candidates. Telephones and cellphones rang intermittently or even continuedly without let up as the field agents of each candidates are trying to envelope upon their own efforts the burden of convincing the voters to their side.  The voters are adamant and would not let go of their enticing.  They have decided already. Others are a little bit confused of what's going on, expecting that "something" is going to be cooked up by the aspirants. They get ready into it. They waited along the streets and highways were luxurious cars and wabbled-buggy trucks and jeepneys are driving fast beyond its natural pace. These vehicles were clogged with streamers all around equipped with microphone and amplifiers so to speak. Tricycles on the other hand race their tracks with almost the same equipment of microphone and amplifier.  Moreso, some of the barangay officials and barangay employees were having meetings with the candidates surreptitiously with unknown envelopes where people have been thinking about either money is there or a couple of instructions from their favored candidates was mailed by hand. Nobody knows.  The political stalwarts in the province of Camarines Sur, on the other hand, are trying to analyze their winning stance.  They called a meeting with their henchmen and asked them what's going on at their respective places of coverage. Monitoring was on the go! Not one can miss the opportunities of knowing what’s going on in the field.  People need to be contacted for certain conferences, either overtly or covertly. Political financiers are also tagging their means to assure their supported candidate that the needed funds is already available in the bank for disposition.  Some even have been withdrawn to finance the miscellaneous undertakings at hand to the joy of the candidates and their minions.  Some candidates for senators have already conntacted their people in the province assuring them of support when they get elected.   The Political spectrum now on the verge of either disunity or division.  But the candidates are trying to amass a lot of would-be supporters an their backyard.  Keeping them, by providing foods and snacks, or even liquor drinks and others.  People are getting used to coming the house and enjoy the prepared refreshers and hospitality shown to them by the ushers and usherettes who are either hired or volunteers.  May 9.  The expected rest for all the campaign sortie, but the campaign is going to be formally ended at 12:00 midnight, so, there’s still a lot of time for visiting some friends who were not reached during the campaign. Relatives were coming in to visit their candidate even those who are not within the jurisdiction of the political division of each towns and cities. They come like a swarming bees equipped with fallacious greetings or even bad news from their supposed supporters. Everytime, they have with them solicitation envelopes related to their fiesta celebrations or inter-barangay tournaments and many other insurmountable reasons that they could get just to obtain the needed funds for such an activity. (Sssshhhh...this is secret:  Some of the money raised were kept inside their pockets specially those envelopex kept opened.  The same envelope is being used to another candidate...ha ha ha...wise enough...yes, it’s really wise enough to raise funds easily with the lofty spell!)  May 9, 12:00 midnight. Vehicles were running around the highways and barangay roads like a racing event.  People are picked up by certain political leaders for an interview with the candidates; while on its way, the fetcher negotiates with a big smile.  He proposes something much promising than the others did. Thence, the envelope which contains the amount as proposed is being handed down to the expectant recipient.  Sometimes, the travel would not last up to the supposed destination, it stops in a certain place then letting go of the picked-up people.  (This is another technique of vote-buying.)  For all we know, inside a car or any vehicle  for that matter is a nice place of vending votes!)  Meanwhile, candidates with insufficient funds could not expect a high trend of voting opportunity.  Why? People would go for a price! Never mind the sacredness of the ballot, it’s the time to collect from the candidates, they said.  Nighttime, sacks of rice on board a truck was delivered everywhere.  The destination is sporadic.  People are amazed of such mobility and the swiftness of delivery. Thence, leaders are calling up the number of people who will help them re-pack the sacks of rice by kilos.  Everybody participated with amusing smiles and surprising astonishments.  May 10. D-Day. Everyone is busy preparing the breakfast, snacks, and lunch.  The candidates have given the fund or some of their friends have delivered a number of kilos of pancit and meat and other ingredients purposely for the refreshment of the voters.  Stories ran out. News are everywhere that certain number of sacks of rice were delivered to such and such.  Others have already collected their share. They encourage others to do the same. They followed with blind obedience.  Voters are getting started to swarn the voting places; looking up their names on the list while other find their names, a few murmured finding themselves out of the list.  They reported the matter to the local COMELEC office.  They were denied to vote for nobody have known them in the place.  Others would not want to support because they are identified with the opposing group.  Not one lift their hands when the COMELEC officers asked a confirmation inquiry about his/her personal circumstance. Very intriguing indeed.  3:00 P.M. Voting is stopped, counting of ballots commenced.  The watchers are now languishing their stomach aches.  They needed to get food and some rest.  It take a matter of time to count the casted ballots.  In their absence, manipulations are going on; while other remained blind, others are openly doing the risk of their lives!  May 11.  A lot of scenarios were published and even broadcasted in all radio stations.  The local newspapers and tabloids are getting ahead of hand for people are amused with the nude pictures that attracts them.  Never mind the news headlines, just get on with it later.  The national televisions are having their own hay; interviews are everywhere. Radio stations are playing wild, banterings and bickerings are everywhere; no one knows what to believe and what is not believable. Take your pick....  These four days observations by this writer is a clogged-up dues and I could not keep it inside my heart and mind.  I need an outlet.  Indeed, I’m lost. Confused. I needed to shout at the hilt! I needed to relax and let my fingers roll in front of the computer.  This is my only consolation as I become witness of these tremendous burden that my own people themselves are hauling for their own load.  I can only say that the future of my country may look bleak but there is still faith that embraces all in necessity!

						   One of the typical example of the ill-effects of mudslinging during a political fora or political exercise is the silent turn-around of silent voters to sympathize the mudslinged candidate.   Peaceloving people would not want to propagate the culture of corruptive black propaganda during election campaign.  They would rather prefer a weak candidate for him to be developed while in office than a claimed-to-be expert who knows no bounds in slinging black propaganda against his/her fellow candidates.  People would rather vote for a neophyte candidate than to cast their sacred vote to a wanton oldies who disregard the feelings of the relatives of their opponents in a mouth-battle-tested, arrogant and pernicious talkative.  They would prefer to a sympathized-vote for a silent but a surely potential young candidate who has the dynamism to improve while in office than ferocious warrior-like candidate who promises the heavens and the stars to fall down their opponents.  Silence is dangerously deep in mudslinging...this is the lesson I've learned in this May 10, 2004 local and national elections here in the Philippines.  But, these are not all.  Nevertheless, other cultures and traditions thrive in some other places where people's upbringing is more of "pride and humility" fighting each other to win the hearts and mind of the people.  I have learned that people really mean business when business is brought to their lot in either "political ways".  And there are many political ways available for the choosing.  We can classify them as autocratic, democratic, egalitarian, Maoist and Leninist, Communistic, Socialistic, and all those that contains the "ian", the "ist" and the "tic" words combined; and the grievous fault is that when we choose one, the consequence of having surely an opponent, in such a certain political perspective and dynamic culturation, is not farfetched.  Today, the aftermath of the last election is quite intriguing, why?  Because a lot of people who are now swarming the winning candidates and some if not all of the winning candidates are hiding because of so much expenditures they've incurred.  Others are now even having fun with their immediate families accepting greetings and houlahoou from immediate friends and critiques everywhere.  Scenarios are drawn every second making choked-up stories to read or even heard over radio broadcasting systems all over the archipelago.  Well, there's the opposite of this hooked-up news and caravan cuddling among candidates who won.  They start to learn how to keep silent everytime.  Maybe they've learned the past...too much talk, too much mistakes; less talk, less mistakes it's because they've done nothing for the people. (Handsclapping.....Yeheyyyyyy...)  Hypocrisy really cripples the bone to the last bit of strength it has. May be this is one of the essential elements of "silence". (Watch out for the next elections....)

						   Ordinary people today in my place are thinking about the aftermath of the elections just undergone.    These ordinary people (including me, of course) seemed to ignore the early warnings of Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), a national crusade for an honest and orderly elections; as well as the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), a private conduit of the Commission Election to ensure the sacredness of the ballot, not to sell their sacred vote to candidates who are attempting to entice them to do so just to win a seat in the local or even national government elective positions.  "Money talks everytime..." said a teacher. "People are really aware that corruption breeds another kind of corruption.  The Media has been vigilant enought to remind the voting populace the importance of casting their sacred ballots. They generally tried to condition the minds of the people about responsible voting and even portrayed certain situations about the effects of corrupt voting; but, they refuse to heed..." she continued.  Since the first elections under the 1935 Constitution, breed of corruptions has already been in place.  The potential leaders are fighting themselves to gain the upperhand of holding the national government. Maneuvers were undertaken, manipulation of the national consensus about decisions and national policies were railroaded to fit their own whims and caprices in running the government.  One of the prominent statesmen, Manuel L. Quezon, President of the Commonwealth during the American occupation of the Philippines, elusively shouted infront of many spectators: "It is better to see the Philippines run like hell by the Filipinos rather than like heaven by the Americans!!!" (Well, I'm not sure if these were really the words he uttered, I just remembered it now...never mind, just get on with it.  It's my history thoughts that is failing.)  Well said Mr. Quezon...it is really going bad now.  Your prophesy seems becoming true today. Even ordinary people is radically high enough to contest the government of such wrongdoings. Ha ha ha...wise enough to learn more about his miscontrued facts. No respect of whoever is holding the position of power.  They greatly believed about People Power. What the heck!  But examining their utterance, it seems though, money flows within their ranks coming from corrupt government officials or corrupt private moneyed-persons who paid their lot for 3-meals food for the day.  I have some information that rallying in the urban centers is now becoming a prosperous business among well-educated or ill-educated people in my country.  Money talks, they said.  And when money speaks, everybody listen, thence, act.  But, of course, there are others who played truthfully the dimensions of their struggle for the sake of the poor.  While this could be so, we could not truthfully assure the general public or the potential foreign investors, that the economy is running well. (Well, what's for the economy...my country is going dry...and there's is a great drought going on among truth-seekers, who else could be thinking that this country is getting the greatness that it lost sometime?)  As history will teach us the wisdom of learning more to gain more...the aftermath is worst enough to convince me that the decisions of the first statesmen of my country before it gained independence from the Americans WAS RIGHTFULLY WRONG!!!...but what they've done was awfully RIGHT!!! It's a matter of choice between good and evil, and it seems that the choice was between the two warring sides.  It means that my country is living within the clutches of both good and evil. (Sigh!)  Anyway, going back to the price of selling my sacred vote....I should say that even 1/3 of my countrymen is doing this; another 1/3 is keeping this, and the last 1/3 is highly paying this...the summation would still reflect the rottenness of the hearts of those unscrupulous people who taught the Filipinos to see precious price of gold and silver; who taught the Filipinos to value more of their properties; who taught the Filipinos to study government from other countries and employ the same here in the Philippines; who taught the Filipinos that working abroad is much better than sacrificing a few peso to give it to the paupers; who taught the Filipinos to regain its greatness by empty promises so that others will follow suit; who taught the Filipinos to business as usual that everything they gained from their own practice of profession is worth than to stay stagnant among the poor; who taught the Filipinos that beauty is in the face of everyone that by grabbing the property of the other controls everyone who are living in it; who taught the Filipinos that we do not have our own identify that we belong to the culture of the world and every nations owns us!!!! (What the heck, no one might listen this poor shout...)  Okay...I thirst for the truth, really. But what can I do. I don't have to isolate myself from my countrymen; and I hope by doing so, I could learn a lot of wisdom by the way they treated their ownselves.  The price of selling my sacred vote?...it's the price of my whole country!

						   Today, the Philippines is given to deciding who will be their political leaders. People are rallying in the streets with a shout of either joy or madness.  They contest the result of the last May 10, 2004 elections, posting their own desire that FPJ, short for Fernando Poe Jr, won the election and that the present administration of Pres. Arroyo is amending the results of the people's voice.  The media is playing the lead role of informing the public.  But, you have to choose among them: which is telling the truth and which is hyping.  Such a malady; a gross supplantation of the truth. Everybody wills to win and only a few cast their lots.  The hiatus of Philippine politics is much to the grievance of all that even those from the farflung areas of the Philippines, while listening to the radio reports (because no TV is available yet), shouts their grievances to naught.  They've pestered their own selves with much afflictions and hatred.  They blamed the government for its apparent apathy and ineptitude; they blamed the politicians who were buying the votes in order to win the seat of government; they blamed everyone except their ownselves.  Truly, the political bickering is most serious today that even the small unit of governance forget the truth of true public service.  "I can see that my country is now on the verge of collapse..." says a fisherman. "...and we can only blame ourselves." He added.  "But no!...it is not us who should be blamed..." says the vendor, "...it's a matter of education...a matter of governance...and many other factors that molded the Filipinos of long ago and now inherited by us. We need to look back the past to see the present...'What our ancestors have done before?' this is the great question that we need to answer and understand today."  "Yes, it could be. But there is more than simple things done halfway.  We need to realize the things that we have done first; the decisions we've made; the actions that we have undertaken, and to see the result. And look what happened...it's there...the seed of corruption still lingers to every bit of us. We could not deny it," said the old man who's been observing us chatting.  We can blame the Spaniards with their bigoted teachings of the Bible; we can blame the Japanese who taught us cruelty of human race by cutting off heads or stabbing babies while up in the air; we can blame the Americans who taught us education as a way of life; we can blame the first politicians who sold us to invaders; and we can blame everybody who hearkened to the enticing of much evil deeds!  This is it!...the seed of corruption is nowhere to be found now but everybody is afflicted with it; and it's no longer just a seed; it's become already the blood of corruption streaming to every single vein of a Filipino citizen. (I'm sorry, but this is what I see.  It includes me, of course!)  Now, I could only realize that I am one of the products of this corruptive deeds because I did a single corruption of my own just as everybody did in the last May 10, 2004 election. What I did?...I have accepted the 2 kilos of rice; 2 canned goods; and 2 noodles for a vote to the candidate.  This is the first time that I did accept it. This is madness!!!! Anyway, the candidate that I voted won to the grief of others who lost because they could not do otherwise.  Thus, the hiatus of Philippine politics even to the last ditch of clear mind and spirit is marred with a number of kilos of rice, canned goods and noodles.  This is the mark of so much poverty...the result of corruption which comes from the poor man himself.  Who to blame???...nah...everybody does it...why can't I or anybody else? United we stand, united we fall... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ....madness...purely madness...

						   One of the most terrible mistake that every single, ignorant and distasteful person do is to kill somebody because of somebody’s misdeeds...  The political euphoria that brought the whole country into a mudslinging arena is now practically over with the local winning candidates already waiting for June 30 for their oathtaking ceremony, while the losing candidates still counting, analyzing, and even trying to recall what is the big mistakes that his/her campaign buff out with no winning results!    They tried to call up their coordinators and political leaders in the barangays, but they found out later that they were all gone and went to anywhere else this world can bring them.  A few who are truthful with their commitments went to the house of their political bets and said sorrowful render their sorry words in tears.  They oftentimes advised that there will be another election, and maybe, just maybe, they could win next time!...to the comfort of the loser.  Funny thing,  is it? The aftermath of a national election usually or even frequently result to a remorseful supplication and remorseful vindication of the things they have done during the campaign and election period.  For forty five days, the whole bunch of candidates for the local and national posts are tagging themselves with distasteful smiles everytime they met each other; and now, you could see some of these candidates are in their secret hangouts having fun like drinking beers, talking, shagging,huggling, teasing and all that! Whew!!! Is this politics? No...not all that, of course!  They admitted with each other that they have played a good domino game where the ordinary people (with lesser education, as they said) do not even know how.  Another story went like this.  There were three (3) official candidates running for Congressman in a District in Camarines Sur province.  I’ve learned that one of them put up another candidate, a woman who is practically a relative of his opponent, so that the surname of his opponent will not be ultimately used during the ballot counting and it would certainly create confusion from among the voters whom to vote... Nice political strategy which is already aged-old cunny political fuse but still effective.  He spent something about fifty to one hundred thousand pesos for her to run the election, anyway, they thought that the qualification profile needed to being a candidate for such an elite political position matters not, even an actor without so much experience in the political systemic arena of the country is qualified by the COMELEC! Just imagine, becoming a President?!  Anyway, later I learned that the woman was apparently disqualified by the COMELEC, but the damage has already been done to the regret of both party: to the one who spent the money, and to the other who hired a lawyer just to disqualify the woman.  Both are spending a lot of money for their own motives...cunning motives. (Whoooosshh...)  Sometimes, people have thought this way:  How about when the candidates have delightful thoughts that instead of spending the money to pay off accounts for the political campaign materials to be given to the voters during the campaign period, be given to them in cash?!...The burgeoning debt had already received moratorium and there’s an ongoing negotiations to restructure it.  Maybe, just maybe, part of this debt were spent during the election. (Oh yeah?!) Well, I’m not in the treasury, but I believe this small man’s thought. How about it?    No!...political luminaries eventually said at their secret meeting place.  If people would have all this money, who will work in the factory, in the groceries, in the manufacturing companies, and all other blue collar jobs?!  If all will be given the chance to be millionaires, everybody will enjoy a sumptuous meals and snacks from highly for-the- elite five star restaurants, and if at all their money were gone already from their own pockets, the same situation will happen...Still poor Philippines, as they said.  It’s really a bad idea to give out money to the poor people who are clamoring political changes and at eventide languished themselves to jail.  Last night, the same people that I see last campaign period were seating over a bottle of gin, a famous poor man’s hard drink in the countryside.  They’ve talked about the events of last election.  They counted their shares in terms of money taken and money given to the supporters of their political bets which were provided to them for distribution.  Some even enjoyed telling fancy lies about their own ventures.  Laughing and jamming themselves as if a big hay was laid on their highways of smokestacks and frenzies.  They were all buggling about something foolish that they did during the election, buying time and selling votes to the candidates who are willing to pay the price.  (Well, for all you know, they sold out their straight vote as much as five hundred pesos...yeah, five hundred pesos...and for those who could not give out straight vote for something reasonable, they are paid three hundred pesos.  Least that you can receive from small time candidates is twenty to fifty pesos, or even one hundred pesos if you have a good sense of humor and fancy stories to tell.  Hah!)  Now, the election is almost over.  There were rumors running around the corners of barbershops and beauty salons, and even at the cockfight centers, about a certain candidate who spread it that he actually gave out fifty to one hundred thousand pesos to all local political candidates of their party, to the angry and dismayed partymates.  While on the other hand, rumors were also spread about the long-time political stalwarts in a certain district of Camarines Sur has railroaded the COMELEC with money for him to be able to clinch the winning streak for the congressional seat which people said have been his direly means of getting back to THE HOUSE OF CONGRESS and be the HOUSE SPEAKER again...(Sigh...) I believe that there are certain truth behind the rumors, even a bit...just a bit. You know why?...There’s that old man saying: "When there’s smoke, there’s fire!"...   Certainly the rats racing out their lounge and parties and are going to feast a certain question: “Who is the most deserving candidate who won the last election?”  Certainly, they deserved to be recognized. However, who will try to do that? Me?....Oh no....not me, certainly not me...but other can. (Of course, don’t say this to others:  I have a bunch of local small people investigators who will pin me the best news they’ve got around their poor corners. I know they will...he he he...)  Anyway, I am certain that the scenarios that I have been drawing speaks about our country's trend in this best place of world’s famous blogs which can draw crowds in the future.  And as long as my fingers won’t stop typing the facts and trends of our own political crags and breachy ways...the truth will always prevail through it!    Certainly, with this page, the political hyena’s turf will be revealed.

						   In a country where more people are ignorant enough, no I would say, less knowledgeable about the real score of high politics, while those who have the knowledge are keeping the engine on with cunningly crafty imaginations to put the boiling water into an outrageous debacle,  is not astonishing;  when one day, you could see a lot of people prefer to take the streets filled than the courts of law.  Most of the times, as many stories being told to so many magazines and books, it’s the elite who controls the crowd.  With the money on their hand, they can make the silence into an uproar when all the fundamental foundations of governance is lying as their prey.  People, rich people, or average-rich people, with the power to undertake the latest adventure within the political spectrum, not because they loved the country, but they would love to see the whole country break down their own bones and their own people starting to shot a star to heaven knows!  The holy scripture evidently taught us:  Money is the root of all evil.    Yeah…right.  One of my friends, Perry as we call him, texted me last night when I was still on my deep contemplation.  It seems that his words what he was blaming the conservative Christianity that influenced the whole people and learned a lot of education from its own experience, the cause of division, ineptitude in government service, among the people.  It’s a matter of choice.  I remember world history.  American people who suffered the same unfaithfulness was wrought of Civil war and later realized that they themselves are the ones bringing down the hook to peddle their own mistakes.  Today, look at this noble country….Uncle Sam is still on the go.  Though sometimes it failed the expectations of the lot of their people, when they committed the heinous crimes against the Iraquis by abusing prisoners of war, which they themselves are one of the strong authors of  the Geneva Convention. They failed because they forget the whole mission.  Soldiers are forced to the limit of their own frailties…tempted to undertake the extraordinaries though they know the consequence. (Sighhh…)  Today, the Bicamiral Congress of my country is on the verge of disruptions from the multisectoral groups who spark the troubles and drawn the scenarios that they themselves are taking part.  The errors of intelligence analysis is great on the part of both the AFP and PNP can be fatal when not immediately evaluated.  I believe, even, within the auspices of the law enforcers, people with their limitless minds, can draw the crowd into a raging storm.  Everybody is on their own scenarios, except a few who stand as martyrs for peace and tranquility who stood up their ground to highlight their own motive.  Some people do not know really what their motives are.  But, I could see between the lines, they are buffers.  Just like Eddie Gil, whom the Malacanan palace said: “…provided a comic relief…” (Hah…hah…hah…)  Really cool!  FPJ one of the closes rival of the Pres. Arroyo do not have the intent of conceding.  I don’t know of some people who stand just for their own pride, look at people running the streets, shouting their own names and urging the whole country to run with them, to highlight their protests!…Maybe, you could only see it here….except for one, Joey Marquez, an actor-turned politician who conceded for his defeat in the congressioal seat at his district in Paranaque.  I don’t know of others who did the same.  It’s not the call for the day!  In the US, when the people have already spoken, the opposing candidate, usually concede and express congratulations to the winning candidate, thence, pledge support to unite the whole country.  Here?…I think FPJ will not yet into that humility ground.  He doesn’t know that yet.  But I believe he will.  You know…I just can’t help not to write these things.  I was dismayed over reports that certain people…politicians and moneyed people are turning their hues to bring this country into its greatest turmoil…no, not turmoil….a pit….it’s deepest pit--- civil war.  Anyway, if things will turn out right, these people have seen the message when they observed that a lot of people, poor, average and rich people alike, are really heavy-burdened with the kind of government we have today.  Politicians have their own agenda, with a lot of reserved political words…sweet words…to keep the whole country on the ground.  But, as I heard them speak…their hearts are away with the real motives of why they are there.  I could smell bad with the present scenario everyday.  There’s something fishy about many things. Maybe…just maybe, the treasury is clear open and many pockets need to take the share. (Sssshhh….silence…somebody’s talkin’…) Look!…These people are pumping again the whole public with sweety words….oh no…sweaty words…it’s hot here… summer is yet to end.  Where are the patriots go?…This is one question that my friend wants to ask me.  No to election fraud! Yeah…No. No. No…this is what I texted back to him. But what can we do? He suggested to me…we’d better get some sleep, and I did.  I slept the whole night with deepest thought what will happen tomorrow.  Will the government yield to the demand of the people to change?… or should the people demanding change have to change themselves first?…I know, you are making my whole write up a laughingstack….because, my country as you can see in the news broadcast internationally, in on the loose.  But my dream…my only dream….and hope, my only hope…let heavens come to town to punish the wicked who are turning this country into a desolate waste; and my wish, my only wish…LET ME KICK THEIR BUTTS!!!

						   There had been a lot of madly/mudly issues shaking the foundation of our political system and as I have observed it, it is always the President and her Cabinet who suffers most of the consequences.   The opposition on the other hand, find time of slugging every bit of wrongdoings or rather corruptions that allegedly rocked the treasury or unbelievable transactions entered into by either member of the Arroyo Administration. All they see is corruptions and all manners of transactions!!!! Such a negative attitude demeans the whole political system (or should we say the Democratic System?).  Every wisdom is available to those who see them fit at a right time, right place and in right forum...but this right forum, usually coupled with mudslinging attitude to those who tries to campaign to deminish credibility. People are now confused to whom to believe. Everybody speaks of madness...ineptitude with one another...WE EVERYBODY, but we forget even to evaluate our own SELVES!!! We see others doing the bad things, but we forget the rightful way to prevent such things to happen, because, WE ARE MADLY EAGER TO WIN THE ATTENTION OF EVERYBODY...no matter what is the consequence.  Anyway, no one is to be blamed with this kind of attitude... Everybody fails and everybody would want to win even a bit...just a bit...  First Family Corruption?...What is it?...  What represents the First Family?...You might have forgotten the general rule that whoever chooses the leader is the leaders themselves.  Although Pres. Arroyo was elected as the Vice President of the Republic but since she is the rightful person who will replace the busted ESTRADA, still she represents every Filipino voters even those who did not vote for her during the election. MAJORITY RULES, ISN'T IT?  Many people thought that since they did not vote the person who is now holding the powers of governance, they are not liable to abide by such decision of the majority.  That's why, not even those who were truly defeated during the elections accept the fact that they've lost the election. Pity...pity to these selfish people. They do not understand the wisdom of elections.  They have been graduates of bigtime universities, but they failed the passing grades of the simple people who composed the majority because of the pride of their own selfishness.  Since from the very first time that I have casted my vote to every elections, I always respect the result...the clean result of elections.  But, since then, I don't know when was the last time that clean and honest elections took place.  First Family Corruption?...everybody is corrupted with the pride and selfish ambitions of those people who do not love their own country. Even then, if they loved the country, why is it that it remains peacefully malnourished? First Family Corruption?...What is it?...Is it not the reflection of our own folly? Well, I don't know much about it.  But I believe somehow I was even part of it as I casted my vote to the winner or the loser of any elections before!...and my simple mind only remind me of such folly committed by everyone, including me.  I'm sorry...I hope everybody do the same.  But it is even more folly when no one seats the leadership of the nation. It is better to have one corrupt official who could easily be checked thru the legal system than no one at all qualified to hold the power of governance. I'm sorry for those "perfectionists" or critics of the government, you too is the very fiber of such corruption.

						   In military tactical offensive, there is a common jargon which says: “The more that you delay the offensive stance of the enemy, the more that you can maneuver the striking force.”   This is what I thought the KNP is doing while their other cohorts are trying to paint and repaint a scenario in both the national and provincial scenes that FPJ actually won the election.  Besides the KNP’s valiant senators and congressmen are maneuvering the “NO PROCLAMATION” scenario in Congress, all other petty officers and gentlemen is trying to enflame the mass of people to go out and cry their sentiments in favor of FPJ.  Wow!  This is like a movie in the making!  Well, in my own simple mind, I could say that these things happened because a lot of the people would really like it.  These scenarios, painted or unpainted, draw a lot of eyes on to the canvassing of the Congress as a National Canvassing Board, including even the whole community of nations.  The Philippines, I believe is now in the spotlight again!  After the 1986 People Power Revolution which dragged the whole nation into a squandary, and even to a near civil war scenario, and then later, the unifying charisma of Cory Aquino has brought a newborn nation!  It was as if a painful birth has gone awry.  After Cory Aquino went through and survived many attempts of coup d’etat, of course, with the help of her valiant Secretary of Defense, Fidel V. Ramos, a new nation was brought to a new beginning, a new hope for the best!   I thought, it was a new beginning for us in a new Philippines!... But, regret it to say, it was not!  FVR was made an awesome president with merely 23% win of the total voting citizens. A minority President as he was oftenly referred to.  During his tenure of office, a lot of changes was made in the bureaucracy.  Old crocodiles were shook off from their posted haven, and eventually were driven out of office.  The accomplishments of the Ramos administration of cleansing the core of government bureaucracy was never a publicized accomplishment but a silent bean of hope being planted to make the government run like the best of the other nation’s been doing.  I have this faith in FVR who once again magnetized the whole quarreling nation into one unified people with one spirit and one soul.  ERAP ESTRADA was the people’s choice.  The masses were convinced that he is for the poor masses.  Everybody was made to believe that he really is... even today, you could feel that stigmatic influence among the poor people as indicated by the mass of support on FPJ, a close friend of ERAP.  Only few, knew the dark clouds of the past about these two man of the people.   Hey, I have this buzz...Who knew about the BIG 4 syndicate?  Well, I don’t have to elaborate more about these, because when I do, I have to scour the whole pile of newspapers in the national library to find one which contains the crimes they’ve done against society; I remember my old friend who died many years ago who told me about these stories. He used to used to refer ERAP and FPJ as the alleged masters of this syndicate.  I don’t really know.  Anyway, when ERAP held the reigns of government, some of my friends who have friends who were former PSGs said that Pres. Estrada is somewhat an arrogant but delightful leader who usually escaped from the eyes of his security escorts just to visit certain secret friends.  He went out off Malacañang with no escorts. While all of the PSGs were turning the whole city upside down in looking for him, some of his “friends” who served as his advisers were enjoying the “reign” with so much privilege and favor plate at their breasts. My friend even said: "It’d cost only a call to find one stupid guy who believed that he is still a young philandering man..." my friend usually chuckled when we had a short talk.  "But he is good", he added.  With ERAP’s who was very busy visiting some friends in the casino or secret hangouts, some of his generals were taking the hue!  They observed that the President is not capable of running the government as it used to be with FVR.  Well, they know that FVR was an excellent strategist.  He made up things before it really happens.  “What EDSA DOS?  Really?...”, these were the words I uttered when one of my neighbors told me the events happening in Manila.  The “last envelope” was not allowed by the Senate to be opened; the people, in an uproar, to hear the truth went to the streets shouting their sentiments against the government of Estrada. They want him booted out of Malacañang!..which they did! A soft surrender before bloodshed was opted by Estrada. Off he went out of the backdoor of Malacañang on to a navy ship to a place nobody knew but his escorts...GLORIA was proclaimed the new President by the People’s Power authority!  2004 Election was reported to be full of election fraud.  The opposition kept on insisting to the general public that there was fraud!...fraud!....fraud!... But when asked to show evidence, they were not able to show one.    Today, the GLORIA administration is being rocked with so much criticisms roundabout. Even the "little" people would ask: “What kind of government is this?”  Well, they don’t know the workings within the spectrum of government bureaucracy, but they know the basic principle that when leaders are chosen by the majority of people, they would likely respect such a noble decision.  But, the KNP would not heed.  They have their own interest.  They have their own agenda.    In some quarters of the elite haven, they would not want FPJ as the President; but, in many farflung quarters of the common people, they dreamed of FPJ as president.  What a tremendous contrast, it would be.  While these poor people are dreaming of FPJ to be president of the nation, even if they heard a lot of bad things about him, they are firm in deciding that FPJ deserved to be president.  Why?...I asked them and they vehemently answered: “...because when wiser people are reigning, a lot of poor and very poor people are suffering; and we believe that whoever is holding the reign of government, they would certainly be corrupt still.  Actually, not one of those running this government is qualified to meet our meager needs. So that, when FPJ fails to attain our dream of a good nation with him as the president, so be it! We don't care, we all suffer, including the rich people..."   Hey, is he telling the truth?! I was amazed about the thought of this simple people.  That’s what they thought it would be? Everybody suffers the consequences of a bad decision; and it is going on now.  We don't know when it will eventually end.  As I can observe, the GLORIA government today is very lenient as to the madic attacks of the opposition; I know in my level of understanding, that GLORIA would not want to go down to the level of angered enticings of the opposition.  Well, that’s right.  A good leader with a good heart for the whole nation should not and must not succumb to the demands of her unworthy enemies. If she would do it, the whole mad mad world will turn down to ashes and the fear of civil war scenario is not remote to happen in a few days.  Well, am I dreaming?...No, I hope not. I wish it not...Oh no, I'm now confused. Sigh... the Filipino people is charting again a new ship... a navigation to nowhere... but with an eloquent mother like President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the children will play on in the playground and will enjoy the future as others wanted it not to be.  Sigh...after this bad bad dream, I know, a new birth of a new-old nation will come to rise again for a new sunshine of hope.

						   It has been a gruelling event for everyone in Congress, in COMELEC, the Supreme Court that the recently concluded national canvassing for Presidential and Vice Presidential Race.  It has brought the whole nation into somewhat quadratical equation at which the people begin to submerge into an impeccable uproar or a split-second revealing tendencies to go either against or in favor.  The characters of the whole event profusely charted every move either in upper or downtrend hopes and all.  As I could described it to be a dramatic trauma for everyone when the teeth of the law has been moved to act in itself and plot the certainty of its result and the aftermath could have been a big turmoil.  Election canvassing was tauted to be the slowest when compared to other nations election.  So far, I believe that the Philippines have charted again another “first” in the history of all nations.  During the canvassing, you could see the workloads and how these workloads have traumatically effected within the realm of its conceptual profanity or heaven-like divinity.  Everybody played certain roles within their own realm where events have plotted up to the very end of the last certificate of canvass.  Now, I have understood very well that the chartered course of exercising the very event as was anticipated during the flexing of the election laws within the aupices of congress before it has been approved; I have seen the wisdom of all the people who get involved in one way or another, how  this law has made its own markings.  I could even say, that the events that transpired during the canvassing of certificate of canvass, was really working well, except for some lopeholes which gave each party a gruelling or even a delicate move that would have caused chaos or even civil war instead.  As everybody sighed in joy for the last COC, it was surprising that no other than the pinch-heater Sen. Aquilino Pimentel who moved to the Chairman of National Canvassing Board to canvass the COC from Cagayan de Oro City with an earlier negotiation that no more objections that would eventually delay the canvassing.  I was surprised by such move of Sen. Pimentel, while everybody in the gallery stood up and clapping for such a surprising move.  The TV announcers was even astonished to the action taken by Sen. Pimentel; they believed that it was a historic move for the whole watching nation that the prime mover of the opposition wisely yield to the exigency of the canvass bringing the whole into a new perspective.   It was indeed a wise yielding that the opposition gained the approving smile of the whole nation.  It was so simple to heal the already acute atmosphere of dissension and chaotic maneuver from some quarters; and the whole nation eventually see the yielding gesture why there’s a need of opposition.    I have gained a lot of wisdom in the whole event that happened in the Philippines’ political exercise.  The law was placed as a machinetic grawl at which the oil and lubricants on how it will run when put into execution as the people carpentered it were all aware of things that actually will take place.  The law in action is a law for good indeed when the whole people playing the main characters and villains have done their parts assidiously as expected from them.  I could feel the tension that threatened every quarter of the whole nation.  The opposition eventually yielded the sustained and critical fight of their own lives; the administration have done the best of their wisdom to maintain sobriety and calmness as they dealt with every accusations and mudslinged rusts coming from every side of the playground.  Wow!...it was a wonderful play-act.  The canvassing was timed to be finished during the nationwide celebration of the Fathers’ Day.  It was critical and it has put the whole nation into a new plot of chartered course in the navigational realm of the whole wide world indeed.  But still, questions may arise:  What will happen next?    As I can see it, the election canvassing can be a chartered course of practicing the workings of the law of land.  Just as long as everybody did their part with earnestness, the success of one is the eventful success of the whole.

						   As I have noticed these past few days, before the oathtaking ceremony of the 14th President of the Republic of the Philippines, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the supporters of FPJ have shown their wares in terms of civil disobedience.    They showed no respect to the duly constituted laws of the land, because, if they really are respecting it, they wouldn’t have gone to the streets and aired their grievances.  I felt a bitter feeling about these my fellowmen.  They have gone awry and disrespect was the order of their day.  What if...they have won?  What will be the inspirit they have in running the government? Will there be hatred on the other side, also thinking and re-thinking the pain of losing the elections?  Would there be any chances of reconciliation between parties who have drifted beyond the unexpected result of blunders and pride?  Will there be peace?  There are a lot of questions that have come through my mind and nevertheless the answeres remained in oblivion.  As I can see the action taken by the protesters, brewing with a lot pain and grief in their hearts, they become rascals in portraying their own pitfalls.  The leadership of their group is becoming weak and incontrollable as the people are becoming unruly and hear no words from their opposite side.  As I can see it, hatred has become their bread and their pain has become their water supplier in an outrage of getting the reign of governance that they themselves have gone out but displaying their own selfish ends.  The news revealed a lot of hidden agenda that sometimes the broadcaster-reporter himself observed in the way of covering the whole news report.  Based on their own experience of covering these unruly events of people who aims is to collect P100.00 bills from their unscupulous leaders who financed such mass actions against the duly constituted government included therein also was reportedly kilos of rice for their own family good for the day.  Where is the real grievance that they’ve been trying to air?  Is there truth in their campaign? Well, I don’t see any reason at all for that fact.  Because I truly believed that people who are fighting for certain ideological beliefs or political goals have to sacrifice something of their own for the benefit of the many.  Here, in the Philippines, I can see that the old paths of glory is gone awry.  The truest motive of heart from the people who conduct mass actions is not really felt within the hearts of those who are governing.    Why?   Because the words that they have spoken remains to be within the realm of their expected selfish ends.  The thunder of words that you may have heard from their ranks were words reflective of their own pitfalls, hence, their wrong perceptions has been an advanced dungeon of their own views of the realities that they see on government.  Even then, they knew that they will fail, but incessant fire is fanned by those people whose plan is for the continued suffering of the people of their own feathers.

						   There has been so much hype on the case of Angelo dela Cruz, a cargo truck driver kidnapped by Iraqi militants and was about to loss his head if the Philippine government have had refused to withdraw its miniscule humanitarian troops deployed in war-torn Iraq.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were it not for Angelo dela Cruz, our troops would have staying in Iraq up to August 2004.  &nbsp;  In anyway, the implication of such withdrawal of troops signifies many negative impression on the part of the international community who’d been observing the actions of the Philippines towards resolving this issue.&nbsp; Unlike Bulgaria and Korea who’d been supportive to US action against the regime of Saddam Hussein, now ousted President of this middleast country, it nearly buckledown the already spent effort of the US in terms of stabilizing the situation in Iraq.&nbsp; The withdrawal of the staunch supporter of the US, the Philippines, brought a wasted risk of lives among those who were willing to gamble their own resources just to let go and free the chained people of Iraq.  &nbsp;  The action of the Philippine government have caused collapsed international diplomatic relation that would, in the long run, affect the country’s relation with other countries.&nbsp; Dealing with terrorists, indeed, is not an easy task; and the Philippines closely know why the US refuse to negotiate with terrorists.&nbsp; They have their own experiences and wisdom why they wouldn’t tolerate such demands and yield to the negotiations.  &nbsp;  I can see the wisdom also on the part of my government.&nbsp; But in any angle of perspective and dynamic realization, such negotiation with the terrorist is a cuddling action that we, as Filipinos, have that intimate views about one person in relation to the bigger proportions of the population who’d been in the quagmire of poverty as caused by decisions that have no strategic value at all in terms of the global situation.  &nbsp;  For last two months at most, the country has been within the spotlight of the world: observing what actions and alternative would the Philippine government do to resolve this impasse.  &nbsp;  Now that the crisis is over; still the issue did not die down that slow.&nbsp; It even increased into a tremendous magnitude as if the whole of the Philippines is on for a festivity; and the media is feasting for Angelo dela Cruz and other issues of higher priority is now laid down to give way of welcoming the man who’ve awakened the eyes of the world and see the “cowardice” decision of my own government.&nbsp; I don’t know how will I call it.&nbsp; But it hurts and caused so much pain for the whole wide world that my country have this “entangled tendency” to yield to the enemies of the world --- the terrorists.  &nbsp;  I could not blame my government of such a hard decision.&nbsp; But still, I just hope that this would not cause so much trouble when other times come.&nbsp; History repeats itself.
