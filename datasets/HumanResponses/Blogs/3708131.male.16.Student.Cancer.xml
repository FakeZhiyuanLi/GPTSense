       urlLink    Everyone should check out the above link.  It's about a private company that is the first to send a man into space.  It had nothing to do with the U.S. Government and it supposedly costed a fraction less than what NASA pays to put a man into space.  This whole thing is supposed to work towards researching the possibility of space tourism.  I think this is a pretty cool idea, to send people to space for money.  But the cost is incredible, you have to be some kinda rich to be able to buy a ride to space.  Costs are predicted to be about $100,000.  Keep in mind this is in the next 50 years as well, because the technology is not ready for "regular consumer use."  What regular consumer has $100,000 to spend to go to outer space?  For $100,000 dollars, here's what you get.        - A 90 minute space ship ride that is extremely demanding physically.       - About 3 minutes of actual space time.       - Possibility of death.       - A package of M&M's to throw around, in case you get bored while your there.       - You will be famous for a few days.    I like the idea...if anyone has some spare money they'd like to give me so I can enjoy a trip to outer space, you can contact me at nicklasvishnov@netscape.net.  P.S. - Prices are predicted to decrease DRASTICALLY after the introduction of high capacity spacecraft.  Prices are supposed to be in the $40,000 range.  At least we have something to look forward to.

      Hello,  My name is Warren, I'm 16 and I'm from Texas.  I'm totally new to the whole blogging scene, in fact, I only know about it from an article I read in Times magazine, and I was interested immediatley.  It talked about amateur journalism, and the affect blogs had on "real" new corporations, so I thought I'd check it out and see what it's all about.  I play ice hockey, I play soccer recreationally, not on a team, and I love to watch international soccer, my favorite team being Team Netherlands.  I will be a junior in high school, and this is my blog, where I will proceed to post whatever I feel like, and say whatever I want, isn't that what blogs area all about anyway? I hope at least some of you enjoy.
