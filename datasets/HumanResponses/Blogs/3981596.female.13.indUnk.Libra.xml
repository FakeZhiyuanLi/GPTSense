        today was AWESOME dude!!!!! well, not the very beginning, cuz i had to wake up at 7:15 (bleh) but it was to go to seattle center academy! yayerz!! well, anyway, the other ppl from einstein who were there were kristina hammer, lauren campbell, yi (hehe...asian 'fro boy), allison sherris, peet, and stephanie akers. it was really fun, but the classes that i got werent as great as last year's. anyway, they gave us muffins and juice at the academy and they were tasty :-D soooooo at the end of the day when i was eating my muffin, i was IM-ing davis on my phone and he was just like "you're meeting us at mountlake 9 today at 4:10 to see spider-man 2.&nbsp;i already talked to your mom about it." and i was sorta confused cuz...since when does davis talk to my mom?!?! i got that all cleared up though, so now its all good. so anyway, mi madre picked me up at einstein and took me to SM2 (even though i missed half of the previews...oh darnit...) and jack, rosa, davis and jacob were there. i liked the movie, but rosa and i thought there were some pretty corny parts (haha...the sword sound effects *CLANK*) and then davis' mom gave me a ride home, and during that time i had a very interesting conversation that seemed to go on forever with meredith. sorry davis, but your sister is awesome. sooooo then i went to the mall W00T W00T with my friend zehra and my sister. it was fun...i got some stuff...and then we went to zehras house where we all talked with our moms for a while about weird stuff...and then we tried to go outside and play football with a "glow-in-the-dark" football (which didnt glow at  all ) so then we went inside and caitlin decided to play the "let's pants maddy" game. NOT fun. so then i went to mcdonalds because the fries are SUPER tasty, and now im home. drinking milk. mmmmm......la mooooo.... CIAO!

        okay, so last night my sister's softball team lost their game so they have to play  every day  until sunday and win each day to get first place in the state championships. bleh. tonight they won 16-2, so i guess that was cool. actually, today was pretty fun. woke up at 11 :-), took a shower, did some chores, blah blah blah, and then i went to starbucks with my mom (mmm...) and then to fred meyer's and got a daniel radcliffe poster (mmm...) along with the tenacious d cd (SCORE) and a poster with a buncha guitar chords and stuff. then, i went to my friend hannah's house. she lives out near snohomish so i dont get to see her very often. since the last time i saw her, her moms had a baby (NUMBER 6), they've added a whole load of rooms and additions and stuff onto their house, AND they've gotten 2 new dogs. so now they've got 6 kids, 5 dogs, 3 cats, a whole bunch of chickens and ducks, a miniature horse, 2 rabbits, 2 goats, and they're getting another horse (full size) pretty soon. its crazy. ANYWAY. then i went to my sisters softball game and had fun and all that...then i came home and re-arranged the posters in my room and listened to some good music. thats all for now...gunna go watch south park.

         HELLO!! rosa told me that i should make a blog.    &nbsp;so i did.     yuppo. dude, this month has been awesome. first i went to camp gallagher for 9 days and i swear it is the best place on EARTH!! i know people who could back me up on that one...yeah i met lottsa awesome people and all that good stuff. the only bad part about camp: we had to kayak for 5 1/2 frickin hours straight! then 5 1/2 to get back to camp!! but on the last campfire, i was baulling my eyes out. i really did not want to go home because camp was soooooo awesome...and i didnt want to leave my camp buddies!!!! :'(    ok,&nbsp;well...i sorta forgot what went on up until monday of last week. i went to the all star jazz rehersal (cuz i was in the band...duh...) and had an awesome time during lunch...haha there was a STUPID seagull outside the window and he kept walking into the window trying to get in...and then finally when he got through the door into the caf. he went up onto a table and flew SMACK into the window. it was hilarious because everyone in the room was like "GASP!! HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!" yeah. it was pretty awesome. i also got kayli to buy me ice cream :-)     on tuesday, i went to jazz again, but afterward i had rosa over!! yay!! we sort asat around for 3 hours having fun and talking about a lotta stuff...and then jack and davis were supposed to come over to hang out too but they DIDNT...and then davis called and was like "yeah...uh...we're gunna be late." it was OK, cuz we all had dinner and then took jack away from the lighters. i swear he was about to burn down my house. it was sorta scary. yeah, then we went down to the beach. then we turned around and walked home. not much to do down there. soo...when we got back, we all took a computer and went online and stuff...jack was a meanie (no explanations) and davis and jack met my AWESOME friend christina from camp. oh yeah rosa left early that was sad. and then jack and davis left like half an hour late...lol it was funny cuz jack kept calling his dad...who was ASLEEP...hahaha     yeah wednesday was OK. short jazz rehersal, jazz performance at central market, then went to pick up katie to bring her to our next jazz performance at cromwell. it sucked. i mean, like half the school was there so it was pretty cool to talk to them, but we had to listen to this weeerd group and it started to rain...anyhoo after that i went to katie's and we made cookies. without eggs or vanilla (we used milk instead). they turned out... umm... interesting...OH and i also got to meet her awesome dog mio!!     thursday katie and i went to VBS to help out. it wasnt cool. at all. ill skip over that. katie slept over that night and we ate a lot of pringles and mike&ikes. oh and katie met my&nbsp;RAD friend from camp!! kai!!     and then on friday, katie and i went to VBS again. this time it was really really fun. we helped out in arts and crafts for a while, but then we went outside where they had WET SPONGES that we threw at justin and alan...alan looked like he had a little "accident" lol. i also played hacky sack...it was really fun even tho i suck. justins definition of a hacky sack: A SACK FILLED WITH HACK. oh and then i got home and discovered that chris and val were planning a party at my house...and i was like "ummm..." so instead a bunch of us went down to the beach. and told some pretty weird stories (haha vaccuum cleaner :-P) then rosa, jenni and i convinced the rest of them that we should go get ice cream. so we did. and then we hung out outside the little store for like an hour until i had to leave. but when i got home, wilson called my cell and was like "where are u guys?" and i said that i thought everyone was still by the little store, so thats what i told him. but when he got there, everyone was leaving. wilson and his great timing... OH BTW did u know that cat dance freaks out chris? hehe friday was fun. oh and it was my dads birthday so we went to spiros for dinner. mmmm...     so on saturday, i went to caitlin's (my sister's) softball tournament. woo hoo we won the game. so now we play again today (tuesday july 20th). and after the game i went swimming. fun stuff     sunday was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! it was my brothers 7th birthday so he had a party at paramount park!! (for those of u who dont know, its the huge park that has a skate park). haha all the little kids were scootering around on the ramps and stuff and there were these older guys on bikes who were like "dude, what the fu** is this?!?! the fu**ing razor scooter club?!" haha so then aimee and sophie got there and we played some MAD ultimate frisbee!! our team totally won. 1-0!!! oh and then me, caitlin, aimee and sophie went to my grandma's pool and swam for like 3 hours. it was awesomely fun. then we went to aimees&amp;sophies and slept over. haha...it was fun... (not going into detail. this post is already long enough)     then yesterday, i hung out at the barger's until my mom came to pick us up. we played monopoly, and i realized that i totally suck at that game. i also realized that everyone else sucked even more, cuz i was winning. oh and then i got a pedicure and manicure :-P it was a fun day    today, im not sure whats gunna happen cuz its only 9:45 in the morning. im going to my sisters softball game again tho...yayerz. if anyone wants to come, IM me. its really really fun. sooo...until i leave for the game, i gotta babysit. bleh.        i bet nobody read all of that. if u did, you're crazy. if i were you, i wouldnt have read it. but, i would be you so i wouldnt exist. so neither would this blog.

(they're the family we were staying with) and i was like "umm...no, not really." so my dad (trying to be all smart-alec-ish) said "what, would you rather sit on your butt at the computer all weekend?" and i was like "umm...DUH" so yeah. i had a buttload of fun out on our boat though. waterskiid...fell off of waterskiis...went tubing...did flips on the tube...drove the boat...crashed the boat.. no jk about that last part. it was all good. i love the boat. its great fun. people should come with me to lake washington some time. its wicked awesome.   talk to me about it later and anyone who wants to can come next time i go!      later. going to play basketball. i kno, its like 11 pm, but i had 3 DNLs on the way home. i swear this is the most awake ive ever been. probly wont sleep tonight...mahhahaha      OH PS if anyone ever goes to lake chelan and is near wapato point (where i stayed), they should go up the street until they see a little shaved ice stand. they have the BEST shaved ice   EVER   with like over 75 flavors!! mmm...banana shaved ice... anyhoo BYE BYE!
