      My best friend is getting married next year to a man I've never met.&nbsp; I've never even seen a picture of him!&nbsp; She's asking if I'll come to the wedding.&nbsp; Of course I said yes, but gawrsh, I wanna see a picture of him already.&nbsp; I've asked politely several times in the past year.&nbsp; Now I am resorting to email harrassment.&nbsp; I'm emailing her song lyrics, all with the word "picture" in them.&nbsp; So far I've emailed her "Pictures of You" by The Cure and "Turning Japanese" by the Vapors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I am considering sending "Photograph"...that's Def Leppard, I think.&nbsp; I&nbsp;hope she gets the frickin' hint and emails me a pic soon.&nbsp; I'm not sure how many more songs I can think of without doing some actual research.

      My grandmother just called me from California.&nbsp; She and I are both haunted by the generation in between.

      Large homemade Starbucks iced coffee...bliss. The boy&nbsp;in SpongeBob pajamas is talking nonstop next to me on my bed.&nbsp; He is offering me 15 kisses, but quickly retracts the offer.&nbsp; He&nbsp;reconsiders and gives me 34 instead.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Ah, he went to bother Daddy now.&nbsp; Perhaps I can think clearly for a few minutes.&nbsp;  &nbsp; In my 35 years of life (almost 36) I have spent over 10 years in therapy.&nbsp; I'm not currently in therapy right now, but I probably should be.&nbsp; My childhood is rushing back in a wave of dizzying and paralyzing fear.&nbsp; I'm trying to come to grips with the soap opera which was my life...and in some respect still is my life.&nbsp; I have a journey ahead of me.&nbsp; I am afraid to begin it, but I must journey to retain anything which resembles sanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must face my demons and vanquish them handily, lest I become a mirror image of my mother who has been admitted to a mental health facility 3 times in the last month.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Since the wave began over a year ago I have insulated myself so that nothing could hurt me.&nbsp; Yet I still hurt.&nbsp; I must reclaim my psyche and rise as the Phoenix from the ashes.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Or perhaps I can just debate here which of my parents did the most damage, that would be fun! &nbsp; I need to write.&nbsp; What other reason does one need to blog than that one?
