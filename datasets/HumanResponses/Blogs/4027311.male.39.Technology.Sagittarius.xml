       I kinda wonder why I am even doing this whole blog thing. I could just keep a journal and leave it at that. Of course, then no one would be able to read it and I wouldn't be the subject of one of John Dvorak's   ranting & raving columns  . But that's OK; I probably never will be...    Enough about me; let's talk about ME!    I just got back from  urlLink People's Bank  in  urlLink Stop &amp; Shop  in Norwich. The tellers must be under a ton of stress, because the only folks ruder are the poor bastards at DMV (and I do feel bad for them). I was so ticked off at the poor service and exorbitant fees and charges that a couple of months ago, I went in to close the account. I'm such a sucker. They closed the account, alright. By selling me on another, improved, cheaper account. So away I went, content that I was being frugal and responsible. All I had to do was get my ATM/debit card and I was off to the races.    Excpet that the card never arrived. So after a phone call to the local branch and getting routed to Bridgeport (you always get routed to Bridgeport if the local branch doesn't pick up the phone after like, one ring), I was told that the local branch had forgotten to order the card and they would be doing it post-haste.   (Riiiiiight.)   Card still didn't arrive. Called the local branch, talked to Bridgeport (see above explanation). This time the story was that the card had been ordered, but it takes 10-15 business days to arrive. By this time, I'm starting to think I really got my money's worth out of this new account. After another couple of weeks with still no ATM card (today), I decided I would visit the local branch to find out what the hell was going on. They told me that the card was mailed 24 days ago. Would I like to cancel the card and order a new one?  Hmmmmmm. I don't know; what do you think???  So I asked if there were any possible way to get the new card rushed, since I haven't been able to use an ATM in a couple of months that I''ve had the account. Well, yessir, we can rush the card - for a $25 fee that we won't waive.    Fine.   Whatever  . I'll probably never see this new card, either. I am such a sap. I went in to close the account because they don't have a clue how to keep their customers happy or back off on the fees. Instead I have another account and still suffer the same service.    I just think banking should be transparent. You get an ATM card. You use it anywhere. You write checks anywhere. You get your statements in the mail with the cancelled checks. You don't get charged ridiculous fees every time you turn around. Simple, right? Apparently this is not an easy thing to do for these folks. I don't know if it's the people who work there or a bigger problem with the organization itself. Or maybe it's a conspiracy against me. Yeah, that's the most logical idea.

       OK, OK... So I'm the last to hear that Van Halen has welcomed Sammy Hagar back to the fold and is on tour or planning one. And they're releasing a warmed-over re-released song album ('greatest? hits'). Am I the only one who's not excited at all about this? I'm sorry, but there was only one Van Halen, and it ended sometime in 1984 (with a brief reprise when DLR contributed to a couple of newer songs for Greatest Hits, Vol. 1). They were good songs, and there were many of us fans who have too much time on our hands that were hoping for a more permanent reunion. Oh, well... Didn't happen. I still have DLR's CD's. Some were better than others, but you gotta hand it to the guy: he doesn't ever friggin' stop rockin'.  Or does he? Where is he now? I thought I hear on NPR last week that he is training to be a paramedic in NYC. I can't find his web site, either.  So is David gone from the music biz? Was the last CD ("Diamond Dave" a.k.a. "DLR Does Better Covers than Originals") his last?

        This is my first blog post, ever. I'm sure that it will go down in the annals of blog history... Or not.    A little about me you can't get from my profile (because I'm too damn lazy to fill in all those text fields):    I am a single dad. It's the best job I've ever had (although sometimes I don't think I'm going to be getting a promotion anytime soon). My kids are the best.    I am a technology junkie in semi-luddite clothing. I run a small computer company (OK, it's miniscule, as in one-man show). I have way too many computers running way too many OS's. Handhelds, too (yeah, they run different OS's, too). DSL, wireless network, yada yada yada. However, I don't have cable TV. Or satellite TV. Don't get me wrong; it's not because I think those companies are evil (I   know   they are). I just don't have the cake to pay for TV I don't have the time to watch anyway. I don't have high-def  anything . My TVs are  old . (One of them I bought new in 1986!)  I play blues guitar. What? You didn't know that Connecticut is the breedin' ground for famous bluesmen? Actually, I didn't either. But here I am, playing guitars all the time. Electric and acoustic. There's like 6 or so sitting around the house. Way back when, my ex-wife used to ask me why I had five guitars. I answered, "Because I can't afford six." My current squeeze is a '52 Tele reissue thru a '71 Super Reverb. No stomp pedals necessary for killer tone.  I have a love affair with motorcycles, but I can't afford the addiction. My current ride is a 1971 Honda CB750, my favorite two-tone color: black and chrome. Runs great (usually), looks not so great. I guess that's what New England winters are for: overhauling bikes. If there are any antique bike riders (antique bikes, not riders), let me know.  Friends of Bill: Contact me anytime. We're trudging the road to happy destiny together.
