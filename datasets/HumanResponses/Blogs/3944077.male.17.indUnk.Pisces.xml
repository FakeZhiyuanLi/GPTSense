						   Moved the blog to the main site, as I said, I'll basically put up something more substantial in due time. The blog is good enough for the time being, though. Anyhow, the Vice City Soundtrack arrived this morning. Huzzah.  Oh, and I just gained +£200.  Shazam.

						   Bought Zeldman's  urlLink Designing With Web Standards &nbsp;from Amazon as per recommendation from a friend. Looks pretty sweet, as&nbsp;I need to brush up on CSS sooner or later. I'm thinking of moving this blog to the main area of the site, actually, and concentrate on CSS through the summer so that I can put up a nicer looking site after I've learnt it. Or summats.   Also bought  urlLink Maniac Cop , 'cos it looks pretty cool.   Still waiting for the&nbsp;Vice City Soundtrack to arrive, should do tomorrow. Oh, did I mention the level on Spidey-2 where you have to swing to the Statue Of Liberty on those alien spaceship platforms, whilst dangling carelessly&nbsp;above water is a complete pain in the arse? Aye.   &nbsp;

						   Went out and bought Spider-Man 2 for the PS2. As I'd previously read, the web-slinging is excellent, very fluid and intuitive. Being quite central to the whole game really,&nbsp;I&nbsp;initially gathered that this was going to be infinately better than the previous Spider-Man title.   The combat system hasn't really changed from the first, a few new moves and what-not. Jumping is great, holding down the X button defines the length and speed of your jump - possibly the best animation in the game (especially when you perform a smaller jump).   Swinging gets better when you purchase an "upgrade" from the store, and hence you can swing&nbsp;higher. Another nice touch is when you run off a building,&nbsp;and Parker will perform a dive, as seen in the film.&nbsp;It feels like the whole game has been developed so that you'll notice things from the movie, and vice versa.   The plot, for a&nbsp;film-game cash in is actually rather good.&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;being set missions, you are allowed to&nbsp;freely roam the&nbsp;city, and while&nbsp;you do actually have to complete missions to progress, they don't feel&nbsp;such a chore, as in the last title.   As I've come to expect with these sort of games, the voice acting is a bit drab  *cough* Die Hard Nakatomi Plaza *cough* . This, perhaps the only thing letting the game down, oh, and the cutscenes, too. But they're short&nbsp;but (not)&nbsp;sweet anyhow. It's a pity they couldn't get the proper Jonah Jameson actor to contribute to the game like just about everyone has.   Close up, the characters faces and the vehicles don't look too pretty. The character's mouths don't even open in the cutscenes. OMIGOD. I know, terrible.   Otherwise, Pretty Good.

						   That layout I mentioned was a little harder to implement than I had expected. Nevermind. I'll make it some other time when I can be bothered. I've nearly finished a "Plan B" type layout which is basically a rework of this template for Blogger, but sort of personalised.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Had a fairly boring day thus far. Purchased the  urlLink Vice City OST &nbsp;before. Been postponing that for quite a while. My interest was ultimately resparked the other day when I listened to Wave and Wildstyle; possibly the best two&nbsp;radio stations&nbsp;in the game. The weird thing about Wave is that Cars by Gary Numan was left out. Strange.  &nbsp;  I think a couple of extra songs on the VC OST wouldn't have gone amiss. Perhaps Tainted Love by Soft Cell, Blue Monday by New Order and a few others.&nbsp;Maybe they couldn't get the rights, hmm.

						   So yeah, hey there. Set-up this blog here to keep track of all comments to be made over the course of time. Instead of a makeshift update page on the main site.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Speaking of that, I thought up a new design&nbsp;last night, which hopefully I can achieve.  &nbsp;  Anyhow, Ciao.

						   She fucking does. Listening to her  urlLink DJ-Kicks  release is a yawnfest at best. She's chosen some RLY nice looped and fuck of shit tracks to compile. It might have been acceptable back in '98, but yeh. SUXX. The album has some sort of shit fuzz to it, and sounds like it's been recorded from a walkman or some shit. The only OK tracks are 2, 6, 14, and 15. Night Drive, cos it's a classic, but she mixes it through to Cellular Phone shitly.  The really shit loop tracks are 3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 17, 19 and 20. The others are just bland and/or shit.  PS: Erlend Oye SUXX 2.

						    YES.  It's raining heavily outside, and was thundering slightly this morning too. Except it wasn't the thunder that woke me up. No. It was the sound of workmen for someone  else  in my street whose having  more  modifications to their house. FFS. Guess another patio couldn't hurt.  Time moves slowly . . . que the American yokel in hell - "Damn, eternity feels like a long time" Eternity in the depths boredom hell.  I don't even fucking know why I'm writing this.

						   Started reading Zeldman's book. It's pretty good, has a humorous touch to it as well. Which is nice. Also bought the whole Friday The 13th series on DVD, not the boxset, cos that has the cut versions. Plus, I've heard the boxset is 2 movies per dvd, which is crap. Anyhow, bought all 10 of 'em, including Jason X, which wasn't even that good in my opinion. Apart from that, I've only actually seen parts 1-4 and FVJ. But, a collection is a collection and that collection must be complete.  Just stumbled  upon  urlLink this . A whole site devoted to the Pet Shop Boys song "Being Boring". Christ, a  whole  site devoted to one song, and it's not even that great.  Anyhow, Ciao.

						   So. Despite my mate claiming how shit it is, I bought Freddy Vs. Jason. Dude, I've seen it before, I know what it's like. He's raving on in the store going "OMIGOD man, Freddy Vs. Jason is a crock of shit, don't buy it, man."  I briefly switch my attention to the price tag, £7.95 it reads. "Hmm, not bad." I glance back at him, his face a mere blur in my vision, now. "What does he know" "I went to see this when it was released, it was ok . . ."  In bullet time, I pick up the case. He clings to my legs as I drag him across the floor to the counter. A woman is there. I hand her the case. She looks somewhat shocked, but I hand her a £10 note. I then collect the change of £2.05, and leave discreetly.  Honestly, watching it at home, it's not at all scary. But alright.

						   Fucksake. Can't get to sleep, at this hour. . . AGAIN. Seems my quilt and mattress are somewhat against me. Hmm.  Plus there's shite all on TV at this time o' the morning. So I came on here, yet there's nothing to do. Plus there's a cat, or summats, screeching outside.  Listening to Smashing Pumpkins - Zero.  \m/\m/

						   Took the  urlLink Color Test , here's my results:  1.  DESIRED OBJECTIVES OR BEHAVIOR DICTATED BY DESIRED OBJECTIVES . Feels he has been unjustly and undeservedly treated and betrayed in his hopes. Disgruntled and in revolt against his existing circumstances which he considers an affront. 2.  THE EXISTING SITUATION OR BEHAVIOR APPROPRIATE TO THE EXISTING SITUATION . Seeks to express the need for identification in a sensitive and intimate atmosphere where esthetic or emotional delicacy can be protected and nurtured. 3.  CHARACTERISTICS UNDER RESTRAINT OR BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATETO THE EXISTING SITUATION . Trying to calm down and unwind after a period of over-agitation which has left him listless and devoid of energy. In need of peace and quiet; becomes irritable if this is denied him.  Believes that he is not receiving his share -- that he is neither properly understood nor adequately apreciated. Feels that he is being compelled to conform, and close relationships leave him without any sense of emotional involvement. 4.  REJECTED OR SUPPRESSED CHARACTERISTICS OR ANXIETY-LADEN CHARACTERISTICS . Stresses resulting from disappointment have led to agitation. Unfulfilled hopes have led to uncertainty and apprehension. Needs to feel secure and to avoid any further disappointment, and fears being passed over or losing standings and prestige. Doubts that things will be any better in the future and this negative attitude leads him to make exaggerated demands and to refuse to make reasonable compromises. Agitated pessimism; fearful of losing prestige. 5.  THE ACTUAL PROBLEM OR BEHAVIOR RESULTING FROM STRESS . Disappointment at the non-fulfillment of his hopes and the fear that to formulate fresh goals will only lead to further setbacks have resulted in considerable anxiety. He tries to escape from this by withdrawing and protecting himself with an attitude of cautious reserve. Moody and depressed. Disappointment and the fear that there is no point to formulating fresh goals have led to anxiety, emptiness and an unadmitted self-contempt. His refusal to admit this leads to his adopting a head-strong and defiant attitude. 1. GRAY 2. BLACK 3. GREEN 4. BLUE 5. BROWN 6. RED 7. VIOLET 8. YELLOW 1. GRAY 2. BLACK 3. VIOLET 4. BROWN 5. GREEN 6. BLUE 7. RED 8. YELLOW  Well, surprisingly accurate.

						   So Yer. It arrived. I've been playing it on and off throughout the day, and i'm fairly satisfied, if not a little disappointed. I knew before I bought it it wasn't going to be some sort of Half-Life 2 quick fix, but I expected  some  creativity in terms of the gameplay. Christ, this is like stepping back to the 90s. RUN CORRIDOR OMG DEMON SHOOT DIE REPEAT.  Been discussing it too much on several forums to bother too much here, but I assure you . . . buy it!!11
