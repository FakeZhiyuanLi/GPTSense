      For those who haven't talked to me in awhile, I should let you know that I hired a personal trainer at Goodlife Fitness to help me get back onto my feet in terms of running (no pun intended... haha).  She's a sub-4 marathon runner and she's currently training for the New York Marathon this year which I think is absolutely awesome.  Couldn't have asked for a more appropriate (or better) trainer.    Today marks session 2 (out of 10) and we normally cover weight training over the half hour session since that's where I seem to have the most difficulty.  I find that I'm always pushing myself too hard or too little when it comes to weight training but my PT seems to have nailed the correct weights for me to use on the various exercises.  In fact, I'm already noticing subtle differences after 3 or 4 weight training sessions which is pretty cool.  Maybe it's in my head, but hey, either way, it's a great little ego boost for me. :D    Did some squats, bench press, leg curls, lat pull down, lower back, and ab exercises today... I think I'll do my last 2 runs on Saturday and Sunday just so that I don't push too hard.    I've got high hopes for the half marathon in September... I'm hitting my weekly goal of 4 runs a week and weight training twice a week.  All in all, I think I'll be able to give my buddy John a run for his money.  (no pun intended... haha)

      Completed a 30 minute 5km run today at noon. Second outdoor run in the past month and the shin splints didn't hit me... Awesome!    Slight tightening of the muscles around the shin and knees while I was running but I think the biggest obstacle for me today was the heat. Lotsa sun, very little wind. Luckily I was wearing one of those cool technical t-shirts that wick away sweat otherwise it would've been unbearable!    Exhausting and rewarding. Looking forward to the weight training tommorow morning. Not looking forward to the evening outdoor run I have planned for myself.

      Finally made it out for one of my short runs again (should've been yesterday but I was tired and lazy =P).  Ran alone during lunch hour, hot and sunny weather but a good strong breeze to cool off in while running.  8km/43 minutes on fairly flat terrain with a hill at about the 6 km mark.  All in all, a very good short run for me.  Very good morale booster... makes me want to run more. =)  Started the run with a fair amount of... trepidation?  The first 10 minutes were difficult, felt tired and stiff (even after stretching).  The next 20 minutes were fairly easy and relaxed once I got into a good rhythm.  Last 12 minutes were without breeze and so I had to work for the final leg of my run. :)  Finish felt awesome!  A fairly sharp pain in right shin at the halfway mark that passed in a few minutes (about 6 out of 10 I'd say).  Left knee felt a little sore while running.  Should heal before I do my long run on Sunday.  As a side note, did some weight training with my PT this morning that helped a lot I think.  Now that I've been training for a few weeks, I think my schedule will be:  Monday: evening short run. Wednesday: morning workout, lunch/evening short run. Friday: morning workout w/ PT, lunch/evening short run. Sunday: morning long run.

      August 5 2004 5:30pm  Running group MAA led by Dorys weather 20 degrees with light breeze. Who I ran with Mary and Annie What I ate before: prune What I drank before: water  Effort 8 on 10 How I felt before slightly tired (legs from yesterdays hill work) but generally in good spirits  Jog to the park from the gym was done at base pace on an uphill slope. Felt good going up the hill not too laboured as I found the proper pace early  The course is a 400 meter loop. The goal 3x3 with a 2 minute rest between sets. Run each of the 9 laps in an even a time as possible.  Dorys ran with us to trick us into running faster. We all fell for it.  First set of three: 1:51, 1:58, 1:55 Second set of three:  1:55, 1:52, 1:57 Third set of three: 1:51, 153, 1:45  How I felt afterward,  winded. Quick recovery but legs were tired.  Nice jog back to gym. Minimal effort. No mosquitos (yay!)  Duration 1 hour  Stretching 10 minutes.  Concerns: Recovery for Sunday long run

      August 4 6pm 20 degrees light breeze  3km run at base pace 10 hill repeats 3km run  What I ate prior: Quaker oats granola bar What I drank, two glasses of water How I felt: legs still slightly stiff from last Sunday's long run 34.5km What I wore, running tank, shorts, wright sock and Asics Nimbus V Who I ran with: Running Room Running buddy during course Donald  How I felt at start: sligtly apprehensive and slow start to the hill. First hill repeat fatigue and stiffness. natural feel did not start yet By the third repeat, I finally established in a rhythm. Fatigue was still present but waning. Pace: Up and down at same pace. Remained consistent and chatted with Donald. Did not stop once nor took water break. Final hill, sprinted vs Donald (won- yay!)  Post race, stomach felt queasy. legs felt heavy quck recovery from sprint. Relaxed as the weather cooled (overcast + slight breeze). Waiting 10 min then proceeded to final 3km run to the store. Sprinted (10km pace) in the final 1km to the store. Queasiness subsided.  Following day: legs still feeling heavy. Emotionally: Good but will feel better when legs have fully recovered.  On the menu for tonight: Interval training at the 1 km loop in the park with the running group at the gym.  Concerns: need to log in more mid distance runs.

      Well, finally did my first run in almost a week.  It's definitely not the type of laziness that I want to repeat.  While I was able to complete a half hour run, I was exhausted afterwards.  Much of it can be attributed to the fact that I haven't ran in a while.  I believe the rest of my difficulties come from the fact that I've been on a tread mill for most of my previous runs.  My run today consisted of humid weather, cool breezes, and ridiculously hilly roads.  All of which you don't find in a gym on a treadmill... I also noticed that my knees were getting kinda sore from running outside.  I think that has to do with some of the uneven terrain that I was dealing with today.  All in all, it was a good run.  Roughly 5km in a half hour so I'm pretty close to my target speed.  Wish me luck tommorow when I do another short run during lunch.

      This is Ken's buddy John Wong from Montreal.  I used to run for pride, but decided that was overrated. Now I run just to eat guilt free.  Mmm.. munch munch munch.  You would not believe how often I've recited, "eat guilt free" as my mantra during my harder segments of my run.  Tonight I have hill work with the Running Room in Outremont. It's a place near my highschool where we will be doing 10 hill repeats.  Thank goodness there's a gourment ice cream place just around the corner from the store.  I just picked up my train ticket for Toronto. I can't believe it. Now that I've actually forked out the dough for the train ticket, there's no turning back now. Half marathon here I come. It's a good thing that Ken knows first aid. I might put his knowledge to the test.  Until the next blog,  Eatin' guilt free  JW

      The past long weekend was a complete bust in terms of training.  Very very dissapointing for me.  I think it had to do with the fact that my past week has been kinda busy and that I didn't get as much sleep as I required.  Too many things going on alongside my training.  Today I turned that around though.  I spent about 40 minutes in the gym this morning doing my basic weight training exercises as outlined by my personal trainer.  Feeling good about myself this morning.   Enough that I'm planning on doing a short run during lunch or after work (3 - 4 miles).  With any luck, I'll be able to complete the full training schedule that my PT laid out for me before the end of the week without killing myself. :)  BTW, my PT sent me this link about running which I thought was an excellent short read   urlLink Running: the difference between 'style' and proper technique

      Slept late on Friday night, had to do laundry Saturday morning, on an SJA duty for the rest of the day.  No training.   'nuff said.  I'll try doing my short run on Sunday afternoon and play catch up next week.

      August 12, 2004 Time: 5:30pm Place: MAA gym led by Dorys Langlois Path Gym-1km loop and back How I felt:  Tired going in What I ate: McD ice cream sundae Humidity: heavy factor 7/10  Exercise: 2 loops with each loop at a consistent pace Lap 1 5:12 Lap 2 4:48 3 min break  Lap 3. 4:54   How I felt during. pf in left foot started to flare. Shin pain from left foot as well. Felt really tired as if I had lost my wind. The effort put out for that pace was way too much. Tuesday and Wednesday training took it's toll on me it overwhelmed me.  Lesson learned. I have reached diminishing returns with the volume of training. I will take today and depending. tomorrow off. I feel completely drained.  Concerns: How long before I recover I have a long run this Sunday. Sat as well.

      The past week has been a complete writeoff.  I didn't mean for it to happen, but the facts remain the same.  I haven't had any training at all over the past week.  The entire week was spent getting my car fixed, driving to and from TO, seeing friends/girlfriend, work, sja, and getting that damn little PC of mine up and running again.  The end result was me being exhausted for the entire week.    No joke.  I feel like a lump right now at work.  I'm getting a ton of stuff done but I'm so exhausted it's not funny.  In my defense, I tried running last night.  I was feeling alright in the evening, clouds were rolling in but it wasn't raining yet.  So, I stretched and hit the road.  10 minutes in, the shin splints started kicking in on my right leg.  Not a good sign.  Not sure what I'll do except talk to my PT about it tommorow.  The strangest thing was that when I started running yesterday, I felt... lopsided?... off kilter?... like I couldn't get my gait right.  I'm hoping that it had to do with the fact that I hadn't run in almost a week.  Which could have led to my shin splint due to awkward strides?  I dunno.  I'll talk to my PT tommorow and see what she says.  Not to worry though.  My payment is in, I'm *registered* for the half marathon.  One way of the other, I'm crossing that finish line baby!

      August 11, 2004  Time 6:00pm Location: Running Rooom in Outremont Group 1/2 marathoners Weather 20 degrees Humidity factor 4/10  Distance 3 km, 9 hill repeats and 3km back How I felt before. good and solid (no injuries, or tenderness) How I felt during:  expected difficulty in the latter hills and I did. (hills 8 and 9)  Met new people. Initially no one is talkative and people talk to themselves but toward the end, everyone came around and was chatty.  My other group (marathon) was upset that I chose hills over fartlek. I ran fartlek in the rain on Tuesday and needed to develop leg strength. Tonight I have fartlek with the easy group in the park. I need to pick and choose my spots. As the races draw closer and closer, I need to be very selective in terms of the workouts I follow.  Sprint finish. I was running sub 5min/km.  This is for real. I had thought previously that it was a fluke being able to post up such a time but I am finally coming into my own. I just to continue that work.  So much to do so little time.  How I felt physically afterward. Really, really tired. Wasn't in the mood to socialize. Ate and went to bed. Lost weight. Now I'm a size 28.   Concerns:  Will I be able to post a 4 hour time.  Hmmm..

      August 10 2004 5:30pm Location 1km loop around the park behind the statue Running group MAA led by Dorys advance group Weather:  humid (air was warm and heavy factor 8/10)                    light breeze, intermittent and sporadic  What I ate prior, 2 yogurt and 1 banana 2 hours prior How a I felt: legs slightly stiff from Sunday's long run but generally alright  Ran from the gym to the the beginning of the loop (long way) 15 min  Piece:  Run for 5 min at 85% (10km pace) and rest for 2:30 return to the start position for each loop.   Each lap was completed prior to the 5 min elasping.  By the 3rd loop we were caught in a heavy rain which lasted for 20 min.  Shoes soaked up water like a sponge. Shorts were tight and clingy. T-shirt as well.  Tracked dirt all over my calves, butt and lower half of the back of my t-shirt.  Good thing according to Dorys, under the Pose technique dirt is supposed to be thrown up that high. He was sporting dirt completed down his back.  Following the rain the veil of humidity was lifted and the run became simpler despite our clothes restricting us. I was able to complete my final lap in 4:42.   Felt great. Perhaps I might be able to run a sub 45 min 10km.  Wishfull thinking?  Hmm....  Did not have time to strectch. Sand all over the place. Felt great. No pain following day.

      August 7th 7:30am Ran with Running Room Distance: 23km (ended up being 24.5 for me) How I felt before: Tired slept late not a good sleep  What I ate: Yogurt and a banana What I wore, Sugoi long sleeve, shorts, wrightsock and Asics Nimbus V  Running group only 6 people No running buddy in particular floated around  The first five km were the hardest. I struggled to find the proper pace and rhythm.  The long sleeve shirt made things less comfortable than usual (I'm used to tank tops) I had the zipper all the way down.  The temp warmed up slightly and the humidity was rising (difficulty 5-6 on ten)  After first 10km broke from the pack and ran 5km by myself and then returned to the pack.  Ten and ones were helpful.  I could feel the fatigue set in.  Sprinted the last km (4:45) and stretched were.  How I felt during the run. Great. At km 19 Dimitra, Alain and myself were sprinting. 4:50/km It felt really great as there was a light cross breeze.  Concerns:  I weighed myself yesterday and following the run at the gym and at home and I lost 6 pound.  I went from 144 to 138 lbs, representing a 4.10 % drop. Must have been water weight but I rehydrated  and did not feel thirsty.  Hmm..  Effort was there but I need to rest better.

Slightly dehydrated only one waterfountain did not bring waterbottle (dummy)  HRM was uncomfortable as I wasn't used to having it around my chest.  Stopped twice for water.  How I felt afterward satisfied (no injuries) but concerned.  Concerns:  the fact that my heart rate went past 140 so easily.  Can't rely on feeling grr...

      August 18 2004 Time: 6:30pm Place Running Room (Outremont) Group leader Dimitra On the menu: Interval Total mileage:  12km  Weather low 20s humidity factor 5 on 10 How I felt before slightly tired but ready to run What I wore, Orange run tank, Nike shorts, wright sock and Nimbus V  Jogged from Running Room west past OHS down cote sainte catherine to 1km loop Ran the 1km loop in line formation whereby everyone jogged and the last person in the line sprinted to the top the line. Then ran the 400m loop 1 slow 2 fast 2 slow 1 fast 1 slow 1 fast 1 slow  Ran the first sprint too hard and paid for it dearly in the middle. Once I stopped for a break at the end of the drill one a guy (Iron man) and myself sprinted all the way back to the store. That felt great 2-3km sprint.  Pretty wild considering I sprinted hard at the beginning, pretty  much died in the middle In the end my quads were slightly stiff.  Concerns: My hamstrings are becoming larger than my quads, I have to work the quads out.

      August 17 2004 Time: 5:30pm Place MAA gym led by Dorys Weather mid 20s humidity factor 6 on 10  How I felt prior. left shin/ankle flaring up sporadically.  Path from Gym around the park up the trail to the start of the 1km loop On the menu:  4 seven minue pieces at 85% effort (speed that you would be able to maintain for a half hour run) 3 minute rest inbetween each piece.  First lap was completed at: 4:38 Second at 4:51. Don't remember 3rd. Final was at 4:50 There were segments of each lap which seemed reallly difficult and some segments that were too easy.  The shin/ankle injury mitigated my speed work. I was last in the field to complete.  How I felt afterward, Good and strong. The hard run allowed my body for find its natural rhythm.   Concern:  If only it didn't take an half hour of hard running to get me warmed up.

      Sunday August 14 2004 Time 7:30am Place: Running Room in Outremont Weather 13 degrees humidity factor 3 on 10 at the end:  mid 20s humidity factor 5 on 10  How I felt before: Pain in left ankle was still present. What I ate: Banana and yogust What I was wearing Insight Run tank, Nike run shorts and Asic  Nimbus V Distance 29km Path: Store down to old port West waterfountain on the path toward Lachine Canal cross bridge and return.  Cut through Atwater market up to Sherbrooke down to Parc and stopped at the Statue at Mont Royal park  Pace 6min km no faster. Kept pace with the group. Practiced 10 and 1. Easy pace I was talking with the other runners. It's funny I'm looked at like a veteran runner by older people and the run leaders themselves.  Time run 3:30. Actual time elasped 4:30 (approx) At the start my ankle was still stiff so I did was not sure if I was going to run this distance. The stiffness was manageable as I did not push the pace. Ran with 2 new people who never ran more than 10km. The both dropped out and took metro home. One at the 20km mark and the other at the 25km mark  I actually convinced a guy how important pacing was. Once he witnessed the other 2 runners drop out He thanked me for pacing him.   He is used to running faster but by conserving energy early it enabled him to successfully complete with the temperature became hotter and more humid.  I wanted to run faster but I did not early for fear of injury and could not later as the heat drained me.  Concerns: 10 and 1 approach drains so much energy in the later stages. What will I do on race day.  Stopped at the park and walked back. As I was walked, the legs were becoming increasingly stiff with each step I was really hungry at the 25km mark. What strategy should I follow for the race on the big day?

      In a park far far away .... from Toronto.  ahem.  excuse me.  It's the geek talking.  No training between last Friday and this morning unfortunately.  Real Life (tm) was taking up a good chunk of my time again.  Early this morning, I had a session with my PT.  The exercise today had to do with intervals.  She wanted to watch my stride/gait as I was running so we hit a track not too far away from the Goodlife that I train at.  Ran/walked/sprinted as much as I could over the next half hour.  I probably should've gotten more sleep the night before but I was busy with SJA.  And I probably should've eaten something but I didn't have anything appropriate in the fridge.  At least I drank enuf water. :)  At any rate, my PT said that my stride/form looked good (except for how I use my arms).  Gave me a few pointers on how to use my arms to my advantage while sprinting (loosen them up).   So, it's possible that it's not how I'm running that's causing shin splints.  And it doesn't look like my shoes are a problem.  So, ultimately, I still don't know why I get shin splints every so often. Good thing I've booked an appointment with a sports doctor.  Hopefully he'll be able to shed some light on the issue.  The session today gives me hope that I'll be able to do the half without any major problems.  BTW, Bonky... man you're making me look like a lazy ass... :)

      August 14 2004 Time 10am Weather 20 degrees Humdit factor 4/10 Path, MAA to Lafontaine 2 loops and back How I felt before: Slightly tired from Thursday's practice Distance: 12km  What I ate before, yogurt banana Pace: brutal  Fatigue and an unknown pain from my originating from my left ankle relegated what was to be an easy run into a tough effort.  Not wanting to aggravate this pain, for Sunday's long run I ran slowly and could not for the duration of the outing find my rhythm and regular pace. Breathing was irregular and heart rate shot up fast despite the slow speed.  Time to completion 1.5 hours. Rest break every 10min breaks became progessively longer as the session progressed. Running faster to establish a rhythm did not help as fatigue overwhelmed me.  Barely stretched, hit the shower and went home. Was famished and extremely tired.
