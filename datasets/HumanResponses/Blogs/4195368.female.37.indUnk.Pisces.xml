        Hmmm...about me. I suppose I'm a perfect example of contradiction. I'm 37, contrary to my behavior to the contrary...I own my business, although at heart I'm really a slacker. My friends would describe me as the strong, independent, stable one...though in reality I'm far more fragile and neurotic than my outward demeanor would indicate.  If you believe in auras, I'm a yellow/blue with some green...overcoming a red overlay...or at least that's what some lady in a Barnes and Noble once told me. (and bookstores are where one typically has their auras read, right?) What does that mean? Well according to her webpage:   YELLOWS  Yellows are the most fun-loving, free-spirited, energetic, and childlike personalities in the aura spectrum. Yellows are wonderful, sensitive, optimistic beings, whose life purpose is to bring joy to people, to have fun, and to help heal the planet.    BLUES  Blues are some of the most loving, nurturing and supportive personalities of the Life Colors. They live from their heart and emotions. Their purpose for being on the planet is to give love, to teach love and to learn that they are loved. Their priorities are love, relationships, and spirituality.    GREENS  Greens are some of the most powerful and intelligent people in the aura spectrum. Greens are extremely bright. They process information and ideas quickly; jumping from steps one to ten. They do not like dealing with all the steps and details in between.    RED OVERLAY

         She dreams in color, she dreams in red...can't find a better man...       I've seen virtually every movie that's come out lately...don't ask...its really rather sordid. Here's the lowdown:      The Bourne Supremacy   I was anxious to see this one since I really liked the first one, but I was a little disappointed in it. Not crazy about the cinematography~found it distracting to the film. I assume Matt doesn't pull off the fight scenes well by the way the scenes are cut. The story is only ok and is largely carried by its predecessor. If the first film was Space Mountain, this was merely Mr Toad's Wild Ride.   All In All: Could have waited for the DVD on this one.      I, Robot   Really wouldn't have been my choice to go see -- and I would have been right, but I did see it. Weak story, good visuals...exactly what you'd expect. (Best visual~Will's naked ass in the shower) I know its trying to pull off a meaningful moral to the story, but it really didn't work for me.   All In All: If you're into this type of movie generally, go for it, you'll like it. Besides, Will is so generally likeable, anything he's in is usually watchable.      A Cinderella Story   Silly fluff, but exactly the kind I enjoy. A movie that you don't have to think while watching~at all...and sometimes that's exactly what my doctor orders. Interestingly, the plot in this one revolves around an internet/chatroom love story and the evil villainous bitch (because every film about teen angst simply must have one) is the beautiful Shelby. Go figure, life does often imitate art.   All In All: Definitely a rental type movie, unless you're me and hae way too much time on your hands and refuse to grow up and like mindless media.      Anchorman   There were a lot of really funny moments in this one...and a lot that totally missed their mark which is typical of Farrell's movies for me. The younger audiences are probably those most drawn to this film, yet those who can actually remember the 70s will probably most enjoy the best jokes.   All In All: One of the funnier summer movies so far. If you just want a silly laugh out loud movie, this may be the one.      Manchurian Candidate   Good movie, but obviously no real surprises here. I enjoyed it, though I did have a couple of continuity issues. However, the guys on both sides of me were caught snoring a couple of times in the film. To be fair, we were at a late showing of it. Was a great concept years ago and still a really interesting concept for a movie.   All In All: Good, though not great movie...but anything where you get to stare at Denzel for 2 hours can't be all bad anyway, right? Definitely a should-see..whether in the theater or on DVD.      Collateral   Much better film than I expected since I'm not especially a Cruise fan. Jamie Foxx was great in the film...very understated~perfect for the role. Cruise was his typical pseudo-intense self which can frequently grate on my nerves. I liked the movie, though as did most people in the theater where I saw it.   All In All: Go see it, its one of the best summer flicks I've seen so far.      Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle   Fun movie..smartly written, though not quite as much as it intended. I enjoyed it, but would have enjoyed it a lot more watching it at home with my friends and getting high and eating munchies :) Some hysterical moments and some just plain dumb ones...typical for this kinda flick though, huh?   All In All: Rent it with your favorite slacker friends...and inhale!      The Village   A better film than critics would have you believe, or maybe its just that my expectations were so low there was nowhere to go but up. I guessed the plot, based on merely one word spoken..and I'm sure most of you will too..it was intended to be his "Sixth Sense-ish" tipoff, but unlike the aforementioned movie, it did glare in this one. There was some really annoying dialogue, but I honestly liked it anyway.   All In All: A good idea almost pulled off. Go see it, you've got nothing better going on anyway. *wink*      King Arthur   Went to a late showing of this one on a date with the 6'10" dude, so I was a bit distracted LOL. When a guy is that tall and built, he can't help but be in your space and field of vision most of the time. I really liked the movie, though I can see where its not blockbuster material. Lots of visually interesting moments and a new twist on an old already interesting story.   All In All: I love epics and I really enjoyed this one, but if you're looking for a summer blockbuster, keep looking.      Fahrenheit 911   What can I really say about this movie that hasn't already been said. If you're pro Bush, you'll hate it. If you're anti Bush, you'll love it. Nothing here is going to change anyone's mind...there is no smoking gun, so to speak. Moore raises some very interesting points and if nothing else, it has opened up the political debate to an entirely new audience...which can only be a good thing.   All In All: See the movie, it gives you plenty to talk about since virtually everyone has seen it by now ;-)      Lil Black Book   Ok, surprised myself by how much I really enjoyed this one. I'm such a chick sometimes! "Question: How does a girl fall into a rabbit hole of chaos and come out unchanged? Answer: She doesn't" Wow, can I relate to that..maybe that's why I liked the movie so much, there were so many things I could relate to in an abstract way. And I thoroughly enjoyed the ending, I think it was just what I needed to see at just the right time. :)   All In All: You probably won't have nearly the love of this film that I did, but its a good chick flick anyway, so take your favorite chick to see it.

         I once knew a girl...or should I say, she once knew me...       This is me, this is you, and we're both here...now what should we do? I know why I'm here~~to kill some time, have a little fun, get to know myself a little better in the process hopefully. You're right, blog is basically an exercise in vanity AND I'm not ashamed to admit it. This is my little slice of the cyber world. If you're bored and find amusement within it, all the better, but its really about me and whatever might entertain me at any given time. It may provide insight into my psyche or it may just make you smile ever so slightly, but I hope you'll stop by once in a while and visit me...maybe even contact me..because I'm usually a girl way over bored...double entendre intended *wink*
