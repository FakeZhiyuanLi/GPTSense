      As we creep closer and closer to the planned turnover of governmental control in Iraq, the terrorists have turned up the heat to prevent precisely that.  Kidnappings, beheadings, assasinations, and bombings have become a fact of life in Iraq, and for viewers around the globe. We're exposed to the gruesome details of cold blooded murder.  We see the lives of those that are in that country, as well as other countries in the region, snuffed out precisely because they have chosen to be there.  They have chosen to assist in the cause of freedom, and the end result is that their lives are sacrificed.  As we sit here less than 48 hours before the turnover of control, the panic is becoming evident in the resistance.  They've stepped up their kidnapping, heated up their rhetoric, and expanded their assault on the path to freedom.    These fanatics don't want freedom precisely because they understand that ultimately, it means that they will lose what power they have to rule through fear and intimidation.  The violence that they use to create their power has diminished results once the taste of freedom has been given to the millions of peace loving people who only want the opportunity to live their lives.  Most of us who don't have first-hand knowledge of what is going on over there, sit in utter bewilderment.  We wonder why it is that they would be so hellbent on stopping freedom in it's tracks.  We sit here and take these things for granted on a daily basis, and find it difficult to understand why others would be so disinterested in embracing freedom.    The terrorists who are working overtime trying to prevent freedom from reaching the masses are only serving to accomplish one thing.  They are strengthening the resolve of those that are determined to see freedom, in whatever form that involves, brought to fruition.  And, ultimately, the human desire to be free will overcome the desperate tactics of radicals determined to prevent that from happening.

       Football season has officially arrived as the Jacksonville Jaguars took the field for the first time in the 2nd annual extravaganza known as Camp Del Rio.  The new era had a familiar feel to it, harkening back to the good old days of Camp Coughlin in the first session of the day as the majority of the drills were done on the field farthest from the fans.  We did get a good view of the kicking game, which is probably not the most inspirational thing to see right now.  To start with, let’s review the injury report.  Now that we got that out of the way, let’s get right to what happened today at camp!  First off, it rained an hour before practice started, and it rained hard.  So, there was a nice cool breeze at the beginning of practice, and the weather wasn’t too hot for the boys.  They practiced this morning in shirts, shorts, and helmets.  Pads will become part of the attire later this week.  A good crowd turned out for the first session, although it wasn’t quite as big as the same session last year.  Still, the fan support is there, and they seem quite excited about the prospects for the 2004 Jaguars.  Notes:  First, some impressions based on the first look at the 2004 Jaguars.    David Garrard is looking healthy and sharp most of the time.  It doesn’t appear that he’s suffering any ill effects from his colon resection earlier this year.  He’s looking to be back up to weight, and not hampered at all.  Byron Leftwich is looking smooth and sharp.  His passes are the most accurate among the entire QB crew at this point.  Doug Johnson clearly has the weakest arm among the 4 QBs competing.  But, he has nice touch on his passes.  Quinn Gray continues a tradition that has been his trademark for the past few years, having problems with accuracy on the short balls, but no problems putting deeper passes or out patterns right on the money.  First round draft pick, and newly inked Jaguar, Reggie Williams is a big, solid looking receiver.  He’s not a world-class burner, but his physical presence is going to be a major asset for the team.  The same thing can be said for Ernest Wilford.  The two clearly stand out when the WR’s are huddled together.  Anthony Maddox is going to be an interesting prospect to watch.  He looked good in individual drills, but really shined in team drills later in practice.  More on that to come.  Freddie T, Toe, David Allen, and Greg Jones looked good in practice today.  Fred and Toe looked extremely sharp in their running, but it’s day 1, and slaps aren’t really tackles, so it’s easy to look good.  Hugh Douglas looks trim, and was looking pretty quick in the first drills of camp.  I’ll reserve comment on whether he’s really back or not until we see him in pads in the heat of the day later in camp.  For now, suffice to say that he looks good.  Tony Brackens also looks to be in good shape, although I did have some concern about seeing him walking with a slight limp.  The kicking game…worry.    The punting game…no worries.     1x1’s   Garrard’s passes were really sharp in the 1 on 1 drill.  He was hitting everything and doing it with significant zip.    Byron also displayed some nice accuracy on his passes.  Chris Fuamatu-Ma’afala might want to take some extra reps on pass receptions.  In the first of many drops during the day, he muffed 2 passes perfectly placed in crossing routes.  Greg Jones showed some really nice hands in the same patterns, making a couple of really athletic grabs on less than accurately delivered passes from Quinn Gray.  To say that Quinn Gray was struggling with his short passes would be an understatement.  The passes that were caught were usually circus grabs inside of 10 yards as Gray continues to have trouble pulling the string on throws right in front of him.   5x4’s    Chris Thompson made a very nice defensive play on a deep corner pass by Quinn Gray, making a leaping stab over the top to tip the ball away.  Fred Stamps made a really nice hook move to shake his coverage, making a nice grab on a pass from Byron.  Not to be outdone, Troy Edwards made the same move on Deke Cooper, leaving him to collect his jock strap as Troy made a nice catch on another Byron pass.  As if the gauntlet had been thrown down, Cortez Hankton also executed the hook move to perfection to make a nice catch.  Reggie Williams displayed one of the reasons that I think he’s going to be a solid #2 guy for us as he used his large frame to out-muscle Deke Cooper for a pass over the middle, getting between Deke and the ball and winning that battle handily.     7x7’s   Todd Yoder made a really nice catch on an out route from Byron to start the drills.  He’s pretty quick for a big guy, and shows some nice hands.  He’s going to have our TE’s working to keep their jobs, especially Luzar, and Wrighster, who did nothing notable during practice session #1.  Doug Johnson struggled to hit his mark early on, consistently coming up short in passing balls inside 15 yards.  Allen Suber made a really nice diving/falling grab on a pass over the middle for about an 18-yard gain on one of Johnson’s less errant balls.  Troy Edwards also made a really nice diving catch on another misguided pass from Quinn Gray.  Cortez Hankton appears to be prepared to continue right where he left off last year, shaking deep coverage, making a nice spin move, and hauling in a well thrown pass from Quinn Gray on a crossing route.  Greg Jones showed some really nice hands in a grab over the middle on a low pass from Gray, never breaking stride as he caught the ball.  David Garrard struggled somewhat in the 7x7’s, missing the mark on a few occasions, but on one particular play, he actually was so far behind his WR, that it hit Jorge Cordova in the posterior.   11x11’s   David Garrard redeemed himself very quickly in these drills, and Kyle Brady looked like a Pro Bowl TE in the process.  Garrard threw a bullet over the middle about 20 yards downfield to Brady, who hauled the pass in and blew through the secondary untouched.  This was only one of many nice grabs Brady made on the day, so the ladies should be happy.  I mentioned Anthony Maddox earlier in the article, and this is why.  In a running play up the middle, Maddox forced Fred Taylor to do something that we haven’t seen a lot of in recent years by jamming him and separating Taylor from the ball on a nice play.  Could be a guy who provides some solid depth for the team.  I’ll be watching him to see if this is the norm, or if he just got lucky.  Once again, Greg Jones displayed good hands in a dump pass from Doug Johnson that forced Jones to make an awkward catch.  He did it without missing a step over the middle.  The guy is a stud to look at, and he’s got good hands.  He could be one of the gems of this draft class.  We shall see.  Quinn Gray missed low, wide, and behind on a regular basis.  This is the way he started camp last year, so we’ll see if he improves in the same manner that he did last year.   9x7’s   Jimmy Smith struggled in these drills, missing not one, but two very catchable balls, including one that bounced right off the numbers.   The old boy looked sharp other than those two instances, but he needs to be careful with a stable full of young horses vying for his job.  Cortez Hankton also had a dropped pass on a very catchable ball from Byron on a deep out pattern.  It certainly didn’t detract from the other great grabs he made earlier in the day.  Unfortunately, he had another drop on a very catchable short pass over the middle from Doug Johnson.  In a position where competition is fierce, dropping balls like that don’t help to cement your position on the roster.  Doug Johnson showed real touch on a little hook route that Jimmy ran down the deep sideline, hooking around his coverage to make a nifty grab that was very reminiscent of the same type of throws that Brunell was so good at making in the past with J-Smooth.  Once again, Quinn Gray was fixated on the ankles of his receivers in short crossing routes.  He did however redeem himself with a really nice deep toss to LaBrandon Toefield a couple of plays later.  Greg Jones had his one lowlight of the first practice when he missed a short pass over the middle from Byron that hit him in the numbers.  Todd Yoder also muffed a very catchable ball from Byron.  Doug Johnson displayed his lack of big arm strength by under throwing a deep pass to Cortez Hankton by 7 yards.  It was so short that even the corner covering the play couldn’t get back to the ball.   Johnson came back on the next play to redeem himself with a nice 15+ yard pass to Jimmy Redmond in traffic over the middle.     2 Minute Drill   Heavy rain came pouring down as the drill started, so the offense got extremely sloppy, and most of us headed for cover in the downpour, which ended practice for us.  Before the rain really came down, Blue Adams made a great leaping defensive play on a deep throw from Byron over the middle, knocking a sure TD away at the last second.  This had to be the play of the day because of the acrobatics he displayed.   The Kickers   I wish I could say that I saved the best for last, but why lie?  The kicking game is going to be something that we will have to watch very closely.  None of the guys appears to be the lock for the starting gig at this point.  All of them struggled with accuracy.    Scobee has a big leg, but that whole kicking it straight thing can be a real chore for him.    The same thing with last year’s whipping boy, Seth Marler.    Chris Chandler showed the most consistency, but don’t misread that comment.  He wasn’t that impressive either.  Hopefully it’s just the first day of camp, and things will get markedly better as time goes by.  The bright moment in the kicking game?  Well, there were 2 actually.    Chris Hanson is back to form.  He’s got amazing air under his punts, and they are turning over like he’s in mid-season form.  He’s showing no ill effects from his ax incident last year, so our punting game is of no concern.  Joey Z looked good back there at long snapper.  Every snap was right on the mark.   Overall impression of the first practice:   It was tough to get a good feel for the defense in session #1 because they were on the opposite side of the field.  However, they looked to be a quicker group than in years past.  This was noticeable particularly when seeing the secondary moving toward the ball, and the urgency that they showed.  They were also very aggressive in the middle of the field, forcing the offense to earn their keep.  The offense is predictably struggling at this point.  There are plenty of things to point toward that bring great hope for the future, but there’s also a lot of sloppy play that is going to have to be worked out during camp.  I’m not too concerned about it.   More later!

       Poor judgment was exercised when U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown went on that well-documented tirade on the floor of the House of Representatives over the 2000 election, accusing the president, once again, of stealing the election.     It's not the first time she's had a lapse in judgment. In 1998, the House ethics committee reported that she used poor judgment when she accepted gifts from an African businessman.    He had provided lodging for Brown in his luxury Miami condominium. His chief financial officer gave Brown's daughter a $50,000 Lexus automobile. So, it should come as no surprise that she would fixate on 27,000 votes that she feels were illegally thrown out in the 2000 election.    Nor is it a surprise that she would conveniently ignore the fact that thousands of military ballots were tossed out after a protracted court battle by the Gore campaign. Why would she want to consider those votes when they most likely were going to go heavily toward the governor of Texas?    No, she's much more concerned about the felons who may have been prevented from voting, while conveniently ignoring yet another bloc of disenfranchised voters who did not have the chance to vote in the Florida Panhandle.    Those people who were standing in lines across that region of the state, one known for being heavily Republican, gave up and went home when the networks called the election before the polls had closed.     By some accounts, thousands of votes went uncast because of that mix-up. But, that's OK. They were probably voting for Bush.    Brown is an embarrassment to the U.S. House of Representatives, the state of Florida, the city of Jacksonville and the district she represents.    If she put as much effort into serving her district with honor and dignity as she does into fanning the partisan flames of hatred with her campaign of disinformation, we would have one of the best representatives in the country. Instead, we are left with a laughingstock.

      Special Team’s practice is hardly exciting, and difficult to report on because most of the action is instructional. But, nonetheless, it’s football, so it’s better than nothing, right?  Injuries first. None.  That’s always good to report. Suffice to say that none of the players that had been reported to be limping at some point yesterday appeared to be suffering any lingering effects from practice yesterday.  The defensive unit was out there stretching and doing some sprints. This gave the fans a good opportunity to watch Tony Brackens, Paul Spicer, and John Henderson do their sprints before heading back to the locker room. All three looked good. Stroud was out there briefly as well, and didn’t appear to be dealing with any pain issues that were obvious.  Bobby McCray was also out there getting in some sprints, and having a good time chatting it up with some fans. Naturally, the Gator gear was getting plenty of autograph time as he made his way down the fence line.  Rashean Mathis, Dewayne Washington, and Deon Grant spent the entire morning session working together on their timing while the team was going through it’s special teams drills.   Dewayne is a little guy compared to the other two. Watching the three of them working together, it was pretty clear that he was offering some instruction to the other guys on technique, which is a good thing considering his experience. Rashean looked terrific out there, showing good hands and great quickness in the drill they were working on.  Now, let’s get right to the drills.  Punt Returns / Coverage:   Chris Hanson was booming punts consistently and with mid-season accuracy. Again, he’s clearly back to his old form, and ready for the season to begin. Of special note is the fact that his wife and their baby were in attendance, and the boy is absolutely adorable.  David Allen, Jermaine Lewis, Allen Suber, and Matt Cherry did all of the punt return work in practice today, while Troy Edwards hung out with them but did not participate, although he was in his jersey and lugging his helmet around.   David Allen had the best day of the bunch, avoiding the dreaded muffs that bit the other guys, Lewis with the most regularity. Obviously, he’s got some rust to deal with.   Suber and Cherry also had a couple of muffs each on punts, including one to Lewis that doinked off of his face mask and was promptly recovered by Kiwaukee Thomas.   There was one special note regarding the long-snapping situation. 3 guys worked in rotation at the position during practice today.   Obviously, the ever-present Joey Z was in with the #1’s, while Mike Gomez worked with the #2’s. The #3 long snapper was none other than Double D, Donovin Darius. He actually did a decent job at the position with some pretty crisp snaps right on target. I know that he had done this in college, and has worked in this rotation in the past during camp. It’s good to see him willing to do some work with the special teams to help upgrade their situation.  Kiwaukee, Juran Bolden, Matt Hatchette, Blue Adams, Fred Stamps, Lewis Sanders, Chris Thompson, Ray Perryman, David Richardson, and Cortez Hankton all worked on drills to improve their technique on getting down field in kicking situations.   Greg Favors also participated in some of these drills as well.  Other than the little bit reported above, there wasn’t a whole lot to monitor at the practice. Anyone who’s been to a special teams practice knows that the vast majority of the time, they’re working on instructing the players, and nothing more.   No field goal work was done at all today. My guess is that they’ll be letting the kickers do their thing at the night practice, which I’ll be at.  More later!
