       Yup, had to do it as I was getting frustrated with the lack of control. So I went to my own domain and installed WordPress.   urlLink http://www.whilstibreatheihope.com

       Came home, all set on doing some "work" (please note that work to me is web development, the stuff I do during the day for my client is merely a distraction that pays the rent) to find my Internet access was blocked due to excessive Port 135 traffic. This may be due to a worm being on your computer!!!  So I've been directed to a page to perform an online scan of my system. My ISP has also blocked my Port 135 until I reconnect my Broadband connection. I don't run any anti-virus software, haven't for a while but as I'm a techie I can spot a virus a long way off. My Windows XP machine is always up-to-date with the critical updates and I have ZoneAlarm and hardware based firewall protecting it from the outside world. So how did I get this worm?  Sadly as I have around 400,000 files on this machine it's going to take a while to scan the machine but so far, after two hours and 250,000 files it hasn't found anything. I've got a feeling that it was my eMule that tripped their sensors but I'll have to wait for the scan to finish, for me to get a clean bill of health before I get the opportunity to lay into my ISP for being over-sensitive.  ...  I'm also amused by the Google Ads at the top of the page. You mention one word in a post and there they go, advertising bath products. Maybe I should pay more attention to the words that I write or maybe that's the way to fool them into showing other things. I wonder what happens if I mention Mary Poppins, Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, Cor Blimey and Dick Van Dyke. What Ads will I get tomorrow?

       Ok, I admit it, TPR lost out to partying. So many things to do, so little time. I also need to work out how to fit in a weekend trip to Vienna in June, an extended trip to Kiev, as this was mentioned during last night's drunken exploits.  However, I did get some work done on TPR in between administering the computer systems in the office and finally got my main movie detail page done. It looks damn sexy as well, in my opinion, but you'll all have to wait before you can agree or disagree.

       Why do the weekends always seem to go so quickly these days? *ponders* Ah, yes, that's because I'm not used to squeezing work into a private life full of excess. How  do  other people manage it? I need an old 50s style wife that can be my personal assistant and keep me supplied with freshly laundered shirts, food and a personal taxi service for those 4am finishes would be great too. Please send all applications and your terms to the address below.  During one of my two relaxing baths on Saturday I also pondered (lots of this going on today) my love life, or lack of it. I thought I should write a dating profile in the style of a classified listing...   Offered:  One slightly used man, caring, intelligent, fun, romantic, looking for meaningful relationship, i.e. wife, marriage, 2.4 kids, dog, cat and chinchilla. Kids, dog and cat are optional but chinchilla is a must. Very good condition for age, 34 but needs some attention. All offers accepted, no timewasters.  ...but like all these pondering moments they get nowhere other than pass the time whilst the warm water wrinkles my skin. Maybe I should Google for 'Why does warm water make your skin wrinkly?' or why it only affects your fingers and toes, why doesn't all of your skin go wrinkly? Bizarre thing, the human body.  As for why I had two baths in one day, it was an invitation to go out that caused the cleanliness purge. After one late night on Friday and waking up around Noon on Saturday I had a relaxing bath to ease the pain of 3 hours of energetic dancing with two Turkish girls. I was then invited to go out with some Italian girls so decided I better smarten up, buzz my head, have a shave and wear some clean underwear. You never know, I may get hit by a bus on the way to town. Or with my luck, get hit on by something that looks like a bus.  So Saturday night came, I partied (is this a word?), I crashed out, I watched the Grand Prix and then went out on the Sunday night too. That night finished at 2am and I very, very reluctantly got out of bed at 7:45am to go back to work. So another weekend of excess has finished and my desk is littered with bottles of water ready to start the rehydration process and some more starvation before I cause irreversible amounts of damage to the waistband on my trousers.  Kudos to my dancing technique though from the two Italian girls on Saturday night. All those green daggers from the onlooking males didn't hamper it too much then, lol. Red Bull & Vodka, whoever thought of combining these two ingredients deserves the Nobel prize. Maybe the Chemistry one?

       Troy was pretty good, I have to admit and would award it a creditable 4/5. I read a few reviews which were not very supportive, largely criticizing it for not keeping to the story of the Illiad. This made me feel somewhat naive as I don't know what the Illiad is all about. However, it's a good story, good bits of action and enough bronzed Brad to keep the girls happy. Although if I'd been Brad and worked out for a year to get that body, I'd be a bit miffed at only showing it off for a few seconds. Were all the dreams of eating pizza really worth it? In my opinion, no. *calls Dominos*  I also spent the weekend watching some DVDs; Black Hawk Down (3½/5), Magnolia (4/5) and Pretty Woman (4/5). Only Passion of the Christ has managed 4½ this year so I've yet to see a 5/5 movie but I've got my fingers crossed. The next movie for me will probably be The Day After Tomorrow in a fortnight's time, maybe this will be this year's best movie for me. I also read that Bus 174 should be a good movie but trying to find it playing somewhere is proving to be very tricky.  I also did very little work on my own movie site, Project TPR, largely due to a dinner date on Saturday evening and some Guanayan rum. We'll see how this week goes but I've just about setup a spare machine at work so I can carry on developing in between supporting the systems.

       Another 20 minutes to go and I'm ready to finish work, another week out of the way working for the UK Government.  Tonight I'll be mostly watching 'Troy', having secured two tickets to the opening night in Leicester Square, London. This is Day 3 of my movie fest having already watched 'Kill Bill Vol 2', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Van Helsing'. I still want to watch 'Bus 174' and 'Monster' but I'm also desperate to get back to my web development of  urlLink Project TPR .  Having got blitzed last weekend, spending £350 over 3 nights at Tiger Tiger its taken me most of the week to recover. The first two days were spent topping up with water. The next three starving myself as the bathroom scales strained under the added duress of excessive partying.
