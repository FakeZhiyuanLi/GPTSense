      Here's my first entry. Everyone has this website in their profiles so I thought i'd give it a try since xanga diaries is a bore. Anyways, last weekend I went to the lake and Amanda came w/ me. It was fun. We played in the pool like we use to-our little goggles on. Hehe. Just like Amanda had in her post, I really feel like i'm still a kid at heart..yet part of me wants to grow up and part of me doesn't. Being a little kid was great because if you skinned your knee your mommy or daddy would always kiss it to make it better. But now, if you skin your knee you just brush it off. (That's kinda an analogy/example.) I'm looking forward to getting older though because there's so many more privilages. But the responsiblites are bad. *sigh* I guess everyone should just be thankful for what they have. Some people are dying as I write in this and there's nothing we can do about it. So if you just take day by day, God, friends, and family will help you get through every thing. 
     Monday I volunteered with Brad and we went to his grandparents house to play with his little cousins. One of his little cousins has a crush on me. (He's 6.) Yesterday was a nice day at the lake. I got to see my friend from Pennsylvannia, Leighton, again which was nice cause I missed her a lot. Brad came up w/ me and we went tubbing, jet skiing, and the best part..sitting in my brother's fishing boat watching the sunset. Even though we couldn't really see the sun setting, it was still nice. Brad said to me, "Some people would do anything to sit in a boat w/ their boyfriend/girlfriend and watch the sunset, and look, i'm with you right now doing this."; I replied, "I guess we're just both lucky." *sigh* I think i'm a romantic freak...ha Today I woke up around 11 AM and got some brunch and worked out. Then I did some laundry and emptied the dishwasher and made some brownies. I felt like a little stay-at-home-mom. Hehe. I enjoy working around the house because it feels good to help my parents out. 
     Well, that's my life...

       I&nbsp;don't know what's wrong with me. It's like all these emotions are coming and I just want to go crawl in bed and hide. It's prolly PMS, (TMI?? HA) but it's really bothering me. Like I keep thinking, what if tomorrow everything goes away? Everything i've ever worked for in my whole life...gone, just like that. I think everyone should be more thankful for what they have. Americans are seriously the most selfish people in the whole world. I'm admiting it because it's so true. We take things for granted. Think of all the people starving in different countries and we don't think twice about throwing away leftovers. I also think I take having a boyfriend for granted. I didn't think i'd ever find a guy who actually liked me until college at least...and now that I have someone i'm just like overwelmed and scared that i'll lose him. Last year, I remember being so sad because it seemed like ALL my friends had boyfriends and danced with guys at the dances and whatnot and there I was...shy little miss Julia Ann Springer, no one to dance with but me, myself, and I. But this blog isn't about myself, feeling sorry about myself, because I don't. I'm quite happy with my life. I wouldn't change it in a second. Also, people shouldn't feel sorry for themselves, a very smart guy once said, "I think the worst feeling in the world is feeling sorry for yourself." Which is true, the more you feel sorry for yourself, the more you get depressed, the more you get selfish and the more you want. Do you ever think about in a full day how much you said "I want this...I want that."? It seems like everyone asks for something at least 20 times a day, no matter if it's something little or something big. Why is that? Is it just how everyone was raised? To always ask for things? Hmm, I wonder if any of this blog even makes sense because I can barely keep my eyes open and it seems like the past few days I can't even say a full sentence. Anyways, it feels like the world is spinning and i'm just standing in the middle of it. Butt naked...ha no i'm just kidding, wouldn't you wish that. ha. But why does time have to fly so fast? A second,&nbsp;a&nbsp;minute, an hour, a day, a month, a year....it's so fast and it passes you by every breath you take. I guess that's just how life is. Living every second and never regreting it at all. Twenty years from now you should look back and say to yourself, "I'm so happy I did that or else I wouldn't be here today." Just take time to do things, take time to get ready in the morning even if you are going to be late, take time to kiss your parents/siblings, take time to tell that special someone you love them, and most of all, take time to help others, because personally, I think that's the best feeling in the world. I'm outtie... ~*xoxo*~*ju 
&nbsp;P.S.-This is my last blog until&nbsp;Sunday because i'll be on vacation.

           Last night, i was up til 3:30 AM. I was talking to Brad about life. I'll remember that conversation for the rest of my life. It was like one of those late night convos you have with your best friend and when you wake up in the morning you just feel so great. Today, i helping my parents with stuff for my aunts garage sale and we took stuff down to Huntington. I got to drive home which was fun. Then we went out to dinner and that's it. What a life..haha. I just rode 5 miles on my bike and watched How To Deal. I'm really tired so i might go to bed soon. Tomorrow we're going to the lake all day and Sunday is church and packing since we leave for San Francisco on Tuesday. Everyone have a good weekend.

           Well sorry I haven't written for a while, i've been cleaning and getting ready for my aunt's garage sale because I have SO much crap i want to just get rid of. And maybe getting rid of stuff will give me a chance to change around my room a bit. Sunday Bradley came over and it was a lot of fun. I hadn't seen him for about 10 days since he was gone and it was just great seeing his face again and just being held. We saw A Cinderella Story and I thought it was really cute. I liked it a lot. Then, Monday I did more stuff for the garage sale and cleaned out my little closet. Yesterday, Brad and I got to see a real life Open Heart surgery. It was really REALLY cool. Like most people would get sick and what-not, but it was really awesome. They had to break open the lady's chest to get to her heart and then cut open the pericardium (the protective tissue around the heart)&nbsp;and then they stopped the heart by this machine called the "Heart-lung machine". They got a vein from her leg and put it in her heart from the one that was blocked. Then they started put the heart again and it was just amazing. We were there for about 4 hours and it still wasn't over with. Then we volunteered at Lutheran and just did the cheer cart and stuff. Mom and I took him home and then came back to my house. I cleaned out some stuff in my room for the garage sale and&nbsp;I was up until about midnight trying to finish. In conclusion, I still have so much more to do and I just wanna cry and go take a nap. So I better get back to it. Everyone have a good day.

           Last night Amanda and Ally spent the night. It was a lot of fun. We hung out and watch movies and just had fun. Ally fell asleep in my room&nbsp;and Amanda and I fell asleep downstairs at around 5:30 AM. Then, my mom work us up at 8 AM to go to the lake! So we only got 2.5 hours of sleep. *yawn* And so we went to the lake and that was fun. We layed out and got pizza and took pictures and went on the jet skis. In the afternoon, I actually fell asleep at the pool and I have never done that. Actually, we all fell asleep, then it started to rain so we came in a little bit. Then we took out the jet skis again and Ally got to go because she called her mom and begged her (because she couldn't go before) and it was fun because I was going full throttle (60 mph) and Ally was screaming and scared. lol It was great. Then we went for dinner and came home. Now i'm watching The Miracle Worker with Helen Keller. It's a sad movie. Tonight Brad's suppose to come home. I miss him a lot. It seems like he's been gone forever and it's only been a week...a VERY long week. Tomorrow he's coming over and he's taking me to see A Cinderella Story (aww) and then coming back to my house and i'll cook him dinner or something. Well, that's all for now. I think i'll head to bed. Good night world. ~*xoxo*~*ju

       Well last night I saw Sleepover with Ally. It was a lot of fun. We went to the food court before the movie. I went to get a Quiznos sub and I was getting ready to pay and these guys were like "Oooo, white girl has a louis vuitton bag" and I just kinda looked up at them and then I pulled my matching wallet out and they said, "Ooo, she's got accessories too, where'd you get that?" I replyed, "California, but it's fake..." Then they saw Ally's chinese food and they said, "Mmm, that white chick has chinese, mmm it smells good." Ally said to me, "Julia...hurry, RUN!" So we went and found a table far away. We also went shopping after the movie. Btw, the movie was okay but predictable cause it was a chick flick and shows what's going to happen in the commercial. Anyways, can you believe Von Maur closes at 9 PM? We went to try on dresses and stuff. It was fun because it gave me more ideas for Semi-formal dresses. (Even though we still have like 5 months until then...oh well, it was still fun.) And also we were waiting for my mom outside Von Maur and these guys drove by and yelled "HEY BABY!" out at us. 
Today we went to the lake. Joel brought his gf, Amanda, who lives out north. None of us are too crazy about her because,not to insult anyone, but she lives out north....second of all, her family is like crazy and her and her mom live in a trailer, third of all, Joel gets hickies from her..., and last but not least, no one will be good enough for my big brother so I won't like any of his girlfriends, nor will he like any of my boyfriends (But he's warming up to Brad and likes him.) It was nice because I just love the jet ski. Like the things I can't live without: family, friends, cell phone, jet ski. lol Weird, but true. Just like it's hard to explain. Sitting there, going super fast, the wind blowing in your hair, singing at the top of your lungs and damaging your beautiful vocal cords. It's just so great. Wow, i love it. If I ever make a music video, I want me to be singing from my jet ski...haha I was also going to the marina to fill the jet ski with gas, and well I saw a sheriff boat and I was thinking,  oh gosh I hope I don't get stopped , and I was going to be nice a wave and I did...but you know what? I waved and he wouldn't even look at me!!! I was like O-M-G, what is this? It made me mad...especially since I am legal to drive the jet ski and I got stopped before on Syracuse when Amanda was with me and he asked how old I was. Err, I hate looking so young. I'll love looking young when i'm older though. It was also nice at the lake because I got to see Leighton and actually talk to her. I hadn't really talked to her for a long time so it was fun. On the way home from the lake I felt like I was going to die. I had such a bad stomach ache that we had to stop at a gas station so I could go in the bathroom. I felt so sick. Then we got home and I felt a little better. 
We headed over to Brad's house to watch their cats. He called me on my cell phone as we were pulling into his driveway and I got to talk to him which was good because I kinda missed him a little bit. We saw the cats and his big cat was going crazy on the little kitten so I put the kitten in his room to sleep tonight so they wouldn't kill each other. Then we came home and I was talking to my parents about dating and stuff just cause they are curious. Tomorrow I'm going to go back to the Zehr's and play a bit with the cats and then tomorrow night i'm seeing The Notebook with Mom and Dad. Well, that's all in my life. ~*xoxo*~*ju

       Have you ever wanted to be someone famous? I have these days where I just wanna be someone else. Someone who people idolizes. But then I wake up to reality and realize i'm just the same old Julia and I can't change that. Being myself is all I can do to get through life. I guess people will love you for you. You should never change to be someone else to suite another's needs/wants. Enless you are changing for yourself, you'll never be happy. Whenever I get in the mood to want to be like someone famous, I want higher expectations of people and then it turns out bad. *stupid stupid* I've learned that you can pretend but eventually reality will hit you in the back of the head and you just need to go back to living in good old Fort Wayne, Indiana and be a normal teenager. ~*xoxo*~*ju

       I usually don't write about my love life online or tell people, but i've been thinking a lot lately about my guy. I think i'm getting a lot closer to Brad. I seriously am in love with him. People say you can't be in love at the age of 15, but we've been dating for almost 10 months now (tomorrow's our anniversary) and it doesn't feel like he's just my boyfriend, it's like he's one of my best friend's too. I can tell him anything and I just love it. Like there's this feeling I get with him that I just can't explain, but it's there. A good feeling..a feeling I love. I just feel lucky. A year ago I was complaining about how ALL my friends had boyfriends and I was NEVER going to find a good guy. And now, a year later...wow, can you believe how much you grow up over a year... not literally *grow* in my case (like height wise), but like personally. hehe Brad's just great too. He's everything i've always wanted and more. He's nice, cute, funny, smart, fun, etc., etc. He makes me want to be a better person and change the negative things in life to something better. He always makes me smile (except sometimes makes me cry lol) and he cares about me/worries if I am hurt/sick. He's the perfect guy and I don't think I tell him enough how great he is/he doesn't realize how happy/how lucky I feel to have him. Wow, *pours heart out on keyboard* I don't know what will happen in the future but I seriously love him whatever life brings us. Maybe i'm just emotional or deep in love...but it's something. "Love is like the wind, you can't see it, but you can feel it." 
Well, i'm going to go live a little...life only comes once...

       We got home from the lake late last night around 12:30 AM and I heard about the young lives taken, JP Kindel and Justin Maroney. Two HHS students, juniors. They were only 16 years old...16. I can't believe God took such young lives. He prolly just wanted them up in Heaven for some reason. The sad thing is, they had their whole lives ahead of them. JP was in my spanish class 1st semester. He was pretty good at drawing. I didn't know Justin but my brother did and said he was nice. It really made me think of how precious a life is. How we should live our lives to the fullest with no regrets. What if tomorrow never comes? So live life each day like there is no tomorrow. Spend more time with your family and friends because what if you never see them again? Everyone should be more thankful for what they have rather than always wanting. Well I want to close this post with a prayer that everyone please be safe today on this busy day of celebrating the United States of America's independence. Spend time with loved ones and charish each moment. That's life...

            Well this morning I had to get up early to get blood drawn and some tests. Brad called my cell phone and we talked a bit which was cool cause I was super bored. Then Mom took me to Meijers and I got some soundtracks. Now i'm contemplating whether to stay up or to go back to bed. Tonight we're going out to eat with Grandpa and that's pretty much it in my life. 
      You know how your parents say, "You're only 15." You aren't ONLY 15 but you ARE 15. *sigh* This is a day I wanna be older...life...
