      Tonight I talked to D. for the first time since he left two weeks ago. You would think that we'd have some catching up to do, but really, we didn't have very much to talk about. Since he's been gone, I've certainly thought of him, but beyond that we haven't had anything to do with each other's lives. I suppose that usually when we see each other, we talk a lot about the immediate things around us, what those things make us think of; but when our conversation consists of one telling the other about some thing that is not around the other, I have nothing to report: I can't think of anything to say.  I'm generally not very comfortable with telephone conversations. There was a time when I would talk to someone who was far away for hours every day. I don't know how I managed it; maybe because instead of just disrupting my life, those conversations became a significant part of it. I can't imagine how something like that could happen now. I can't remember what we spent all that time talking about.  OK, going to bed now. The closing of The Way by Swann's, which I finished tonight over dinner:  "The places we have known do not belong solely to the world of space in which we situate them for our greater convenience. They were only a thin slice among contiguous impressions that formed our life at that at that time; the memory of a certain image is only regret for a certain moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fleeting, alas, as the years."

      My friend S. called me this morning at 9:30.  I was in bed.  She was all set to go to school and wanted to get in touch about our coffee date this afternoon.  I felt kind of pathetic and lazy for being still in my pyjamas.  I think I'm really bored with my life right now, and so I get up late and have no enthusiasm for what I'm doing.  And then at night I drink.

      I went swimming at the tepid pool on Brock tonight with N. I used to hate swimming there because they set the water temperature really high for the seniors. But I think the heat actually works to mellow swimmers out; everyone there is always laid back and friendly. People float on their backs with flutter boards in the fast lane and stuff. You could never get away with that at Trinity Bellwoods.  Anyway, so one of my goals this month has been to learn the breast-stroke, and I think I'm starting to get it. Push down with the hands at the end of the stroke to pull your head and shoulders out of the water and then thrust your arms forward assertively as you kick. It's always been a bit of a mental block for me - maybe related to my irrational fear of frogs. I am so deathly afraid of them that even seeing the word 'frog' on the screen gives me the willies, like one might jump out at me any second. My dad threw a frog at me once when I was little after I had already suffered a number of known frog-related traumas. I think he thought that belittling my fears would make them go away. Oh, but how wrong he was. Frogs scare me more than anything else in the world.

      I had a dream a while ago in which someone instructed me to watch Peter Greenaway's Draughtman's Contract.  So I finally watched it just this afternoon, and am trying to figure out its significance to my life.  Why was I told to watch it? I would welcome any suggestions.

      Today I'm in Richmond Hill visiting my family. I've been going up every weekend since April when my dad was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer.  Before this Spring, I only went up to Richmond Hill a few times a year.  I had barely spoken to my dad in the past 10 years.  My dad had isolated himself from the family (while still married to my mother) and was living his own life.  So being here so often now is very different.  My dad and I still don't have much to talk about - we don't know very much about each other's lives.  But we're happy to see each other and be in each other's presence I think.  He likes to cook with me when he feels up to it, which is really fun.  The fact that he has stomach cancer seems all the more cruel since he loves food so much.  The doctors have removed most of his stomach so he can't really eat anymore. He watches the Food Network a lot.

      I'm at Robarts' Library, supposedly to work on my paper. I left the house because I didn't think I'd get anything done there. Just had a coffee - well, juice, actually- at the (somewhat) new Harbord St. Cafe (at Manning-ish) with my friend C. It's nice there, will definitely go back. I've been feeling a bit starved of challenging mental stimulation lately; been feeling that just going out to loud bars and shooting the shit with whoever is not all that satisfying. So in the past week, I've started hanging out by myself more - listening to music (lately: Bonnie Prince Billy, Mercury Rev, Rhythm &amp; Sound burial mixes), reading comics (Berlin 10 by Jason Lutes, Sweaterweather by ?, Never-ending Summer by Allison Cole, Peanutbutter and Jeremy by James Kochalka - yes, all very cutesy [minus Berlin] for some reason). Today I think I will work a bit and then go to the AGO to look at Monet's parliament buildings again and to check out the new show in the contemporary area. I'm sure anyone reading this who has a real job probably thinks I'm living an enchanted life, sitting around, doin' whatever.... Don't worry, it'll end soon. I'm already starting to feel a bit anxious about the responsibilities I've been ignoring since I moved.

      Sympatico has been screwing me around, so I don't have internet access at my new place yet. Right now I'm at an internet cafe. I've just passed the half-hour mark, so I might as well stay for the whole hour that I have to pay for. So there's not much going on. I've been reading more lately; specifically , The Way by  Swann's, and more specifically, the second section:  " A Love of Swann's ."  The section captures the pleasures and anxieties of romantic love in such a perfectly over-indulgent way. I love Proust's sense of humour and the generosity of his sympathy for people at their weakest and most humiliating moments.  I've been staying up late reading, and have been getting up late in the mornings. Today I got up at 10:30 but it was a struggle. Cleaned the bathroom, hung out with my new roommate J., worked on a paper comparing  Leave Her to Heaven  and  Now, Voyager  to  A Woman Under the Influence,  and then made something to send to D. who is in Scotland performing in  A Suicide Site Guide to the  City. That reminds me - I have to look up his postal code before my time is up.

      Every once in a while I make comic-zines.  I don't produce very many.  It has something to do with laziness and lack of time, but also with the fact that my characters (usually animals or inamimate objects) take a long time to take shape in my head.  I kind of let them grow on their own, develop their own weird habits and ways of thinking and getting by in the world.  The depth of their characters don't necessarily come across in the zines' little stories, but that's ok - the totality of who we are isn't apparent in every act we commit, although we do invest in each of those acts the entirety of our being.  Anyway, I mention this now just as a means of explaining the title of this here blog: Piano and Miami are brother and sister. They are otters and they like to eat little Chinese egg tarts.
