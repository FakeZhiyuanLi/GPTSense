      greetings...  raman-ra has come to announce if you have not noticed, that he has to go:::  BACK To SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! which he doesn't want to do...  I mean, who needs (*italics*) school?? Isn't it such a pointless waste of time?  Back to boring old school...no more holidays.  At least the first week wasn't bad...apart from the fact that we had "2!!" tests (one a common test, the other a competition thingy) on the first Thursday! I mean, the first week back from holidays...give us a break! And now in maths we have to do enrichment!  Considering you have something better to do than to hear me complaining, I'll stop.  Soooo much homework!....here I go again...  *yawn*  --  .:RaMaN-rA:. email: ram.pandey@gmail.com site: http://thewebmonastry.blogspot.com  Copyright all rights reserved.

I am keeping well, but I want to ask you how you are...if I get enough emails I'll post it on my blog...eg:   &nbsp;   "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah " - John Citizen, Friend of Raman-Ra...   &nbsp;   and so on.   &nbsp;   I've thought of a new way of calling people friends, randoms and rejects;&nbsp; the following code explains how::   &nbsp;   Good Friend = Learned&nbsp;Monk     &nbsp;   Relative&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = Brother    &nbsp;   Friend&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = Monk    &nbsp;   Neuter/Random&nbsp;= Tourist    &nbsp;   Not Too Friendly = Shme    Not At All Friendly = Shouldn't be here&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp; Thats all for now!   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;             &nbsp;R A M A N - R A
