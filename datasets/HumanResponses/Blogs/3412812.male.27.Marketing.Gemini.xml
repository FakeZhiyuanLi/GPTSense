      A well rested LA Lakers took the court last night, and in one of the best team efforts all season the Lakers veteran squad took the fight to a younger, tired Minnesota Timberwolves.  Shaq went an impressive 9 for 11 from the free-throw line, combined with yet another double-double for the big man.  Kobe, in true form, showed everyone that he doesn't need to fly between Denver and LA on game day to perform like the superstar that he is.  Kobe chipped 23 points of his own, and added 4 assist to the taly.  the secret to LA winning out this series lies in the hands of the seasoned playoff performers that grace the Lakers line-up.  Malone, Payton, Shaq, and Kobe all need to keep their game at a high tempo, and keep taking it to the less proven T-wolves squad.  Team unity, something that has been well publized with respect to the Lakers, once again proved last night that professionalism, and unity on the court will always prevail.  I stick to my guns, Lakers in 5!

      Aside from Jesse Palmer's child like behavior on the Bachelor, it now seems as though the remainder of the  urlLink Giants have also become big baby's .   urlLink Tom Coughlin , the no-nonsense coach brought to the Giants to replace Jim Fassel, has effectively sent players complaining to the Union.  Coughlin has been working the team 4 days a week in preparation for this coming season.  Apparently that violates the CBA, and the players have begun to complain.  You are a professional athlete, and your body is your livelihood, do you really think you should be complaining about workouts, not making enough money are we!  After a dismal 4-12 season, where they were clearly out-worked and out-played by virtually every team they faced, 4 workout days a week seems like a vacation.  Well gotta run, time to go workout...for the 5th time this week.  Man I need a union rep!

      This morning, after a 4 hour session, the judge in the  urlLink murder for hire case of Mike Danton  has refused the pleas for Danton to transferred to a secure medical facility to be evaluated by doctors.  Danton, who allegedly attempted to hire a hit-man to kill his agent David Frost, will remain behind bars until the trial, as they have considered him to be a serious threat to flee the country.  Ryan Johnson, a teammate of Danton's with the  urlLink St. Louis Blues , has said publicly that Danton and Frost were constantly speaking on the phone, and text messaging back and fourth.  My calm Canadian nature forces me to be slightly angered with the ruling, as Danton clearly needs some sort of medical attention, a right which is now being denied.  This is one case not to be missed, I feel like I am reading the script from a soap opera.  I see some new Fox broadcasting here "Pro Athletes Gone Wild", could be a winner!

      Well essentially making a complete fool of himself on national television,  urlLink Jesse Palmer  may now be out of work as well.  The  urlLink Giants  have just signed another QB off of waivers, leaving Palmer as the odd man out, oddly enough a simple dose of his own medicine.  Having not seen the show, I was more than happy to read  urlLink ESPN Page 3  morning follow up with fellow Giants teammate  urlLink Amoni Toomer .  Toomer's insight into the previous night's action was simply comical to say the least, although I do wonder how he spent all this time doing interviews, when clearly he should have been practicing keeping a football in his hands.  Time will tell if newly acquired arm candy  urlLink Jessica. B  can withstand not only fans booing Palmer, but dating an out of work, at best 4th string QB?  How exactly does an out of work NFL player apply for welfare?

      Some in the sports industry may say this time of year is slow for them, well if you are thinking the glass is half empty, it's time to start filling it up.  The NFL season is on the horizon, the Stanley Cup Finals are awaiting the final entrant, and the NBA playoffs move (finally) to the conference finals.  Lest we forget baseball is rolling now (only something like 200,000 games left this season), the WNBA has launched another season, the Olympics are on the way, Lance Armstrong can make history this summer, and the Euro Cup of soccer is also this year.  Who says nothing is going on!  I am the Media and PR representative for  urlLink BoDog.com Sportsbook and Casino , which is one of the largest internet based sportsbooks in the world.  I will be using this blog to post up  urlLink press releases , and also offer up some insight into the wonderful world of professional sports.  Being a Canadian eh! I might be somewhat biased to hockey, although oddly enough I am rooting for the  urlLink Flyers .  So as far as predictions go, the  urlLink Pistons  will knock off the  urlLink Pacers  in 6, the  urlLink Lakers  will take it to the  urlLink T-Wolves  in 5, the Flyers will be facing the  urlLink Flames  for the  urlLink Stanley Cup , and yes,  urlLink Lance Armstrong  will make history this summer, and not for being another man in the line of  urlLink Sheryl Crow  rejects.  Let the good times roll!

      A saying which has traveled with the Tampa Bay Lighting throughout the entire 2004 Stanley Cup campaign, and a saying that the Calgary Flames should have taken to heart.  Shortly after the puck dropped for the 3rd period of Saturday's game 6 in Calgary, the Flames game plan seemed to shift from what had been working.  The Flames strength comes from taking the man, playing the body, wearing your opponent down, however from the onset of the 3rd, the Flames seemed to relegate to playing a wide open game.  The only hit of significance came from Chris Simon, who pasted a Tampa Bay defenseman into the end boards about half way through the 3rd.  For the Flames to have success in the all deciding game 7 tonight in Tampa, Martin St. Louis, Brad Richards, and Vinny Lecavalier will have to be eating a steady diet of shoulder pads, dasher boards, and break-away glass.  The essence of the Flames playoff run has been the work ethic they have put forth, hence the green construction helmet awarded to the player of the game.  Calgary needs to bounce back from the disappointment of the loss, and take the pain to the Bolts right from minute 1 to minute 60.  Calgary needs to re-focus, ignore the goal that was in but not counted, and play a physical, tourcherous, Canadian game, and rest assured, Lord Stanley's Cup will be on parade down the 17th Avenue a few days from now.  Go Flames Go!

      Last night's Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs was one of the greatest all around Hockey games in recent memory.  End to end action was the name of the game, which made it appear as more of a video game than a live game.  Never have two teams laid so much on the line, in what might now be considered the pivotal game of the playoffs.  A game 5 scenario is always going to be pivotal in a 7 game set, since one team will take the reins in the series, and now the hopes of a Nation rest solely on the shoulders of the small market Alberta team.  The series has swapped wins, with neither Tampa Bay or Calgary taking back to back games, somewhat reminiscent of the San Jose series.  You can almost see Darryl Sutter standing in the hotel lobby in Calgary booking rooms for his team as I post this.  My original post before the series started was tagging the Flames rugged play taking the series in 6...I'm still in this thing, maybe I should move to Vegas!  Bring the Cup to Canada baby, Go Flame Go!

      I have bit my tongue long enough on this topic, the NHL and the CBA...blah.  I have not once been a supporter of Gary Bettman in the league, and believe me, I have many reasons.  Bettman was at one point the back end man for the NBA, a league which has been embraced by the U.S. and Canadian citizens alike.  The NHL is not.  The league began as 6 teams, 4 U.S., 2 Canadian, and primarily all Canadian players.  The league expanded into several markets all over North America with great success, until the Bettman reign began.  He came into a sport not fully understood by most Americans (see Fox Sports blue puck, that makes me ill, I mean who can't see a black puck on a white surface?), and expanded it into States that have never seen a snow flake, or experienced weather nearly as cold as it is in an arena.  So needless to say the league has been expanded to such a degree that the saturation of quality players has now come full circle.  Some players will be drafted from the College ranks, the OHL, CHL, ECHL, UHL, etc...however what has now happened is that the teams will loyal fans have an influx of cash, and can purchase high profile, quality players, while a team in Florida gets left the toaster leavins'.  The problem with the current CBA, get ready...Gary Bettman! You have taken all of the talented players in the league and forced them into 4 or 5 teams, while the other 25 are left to draft players that should not even be sharing a table with Mario Lemieux, let alone being his line mate.  I cannot read anymore slanderous articles from certain U.S. reporters who do not understand the game of hockey.  I would love to see a $10 million a year MLB player last 4 regular season NHL games.  Have you heard of hockey players crying about money like you do in the NFL, MLB, or the NBA? Do you hear NHL players complain about not getting the puck (yeah Terrell that's for you), hockey players posses the most class and ability of any professional sport...Deal with it, or don't write about it!

      I have been a fan of  urlLink Tennis  for some years now, and I am beginning to wonder why American player's bother to enter the French Open.  None seem to be versed in clay court play, which in turns sets up Final-Round matches which usually involve player's who not make it past the Quarters in any other tournament.  Don't get me wrong, as with golf right now, it is nice to see other player's make it to the Finals, although the lack of star power, and miracle shots, has made these matches feel much longer then they actually are.   urlLink Tiger Woods  is back to playing...golf again this week, and as of right now sits at even par on the 8th hole.  Wouldn't it be nice to see Tiger finally just snap a la Milton Bradley, dump his clubs in the lake, toss balls at the fans and reporters, then storm off to the loving arms of  urlLink Elin ? well I would like to see that anyway.  Game 5 is tonight, and what better way to lead into the game than Calgary bench boss  urlLink Darryl Sutter  rip the leagues head honcho a new hole.  Sutter is certainly not known for keeping his opinions to himself, and believe you me, this has been a Sutter staple for years.  My original prediction of Calgary in 6 is still intact if they pull out tonight's game, and the way this series has been going, it is their turn to win.  If they do win tonight, do they pull another move as they did in the San Jose series and stay in a hotel for the next home game to simulate the road? why not! worked once, try it again.  With all this in mind, win or lose, the  urlLink Conn Smyth trophy  will be going to one of either Jerome Iginla or Mikka Kiprusoff.  That's right loyal Bloggers, a Flames player will win the Playoff MVP award.  Look for either depression, or jubilance tomorrow morning for the post-game report.  Go Flames Go!

      As expected  urlLink Kurt Warner  was released by the  urlLink St. Louis Rams  yesterday, opening the door for a potential trip to the Big Apple.  Would  urlLink Brenda Warner  be able to go off on her little tirades in New York without the media in that town swallowing her whole?   urlLink The Giants  have expressed interest in the aging ex-Arena baller, and having gone on somewhat of a QB signing kick since Jesse Palmer's debacle on the Bachelor, the Giants might make Warner a back-up boy for the time being.  So switching gears for a moment, Palmer asked potential fiancee suitor Jessica. B if she was okay with New York fans booing him, which was fine by her (big surprise).  Well is she going to be okay with sitting in an outdoor stadium say somewhere really cold like  urlLink Saskatchewan, Canada , well Palmer sits on the sidelines as the back-up QB for a CFL team?  Ah reality television tears down another, when will they learn!

      Well I will start by saying that I have not been a fan of Basketball for some years now, although I have made the attempt to venture back into the watching the playoffs this year (for work purposes).  I must say that watching the  urlLink Pistons  beat out  urlLink Indiana  last night was about as entertaining as say the  urlLink World Underwater Basket Weaving Championships .  Does Detroit really think they stand a chance of beating the  urlLink Lakers ? Why not just lose the game so that you do not have to be the team that lost to the Lakers by more than 100 total points in 4 games (yeah that's right 4 games!).  Has the NBA started production on the  urlLink Lakers Championship bling, bling, rings yet?
