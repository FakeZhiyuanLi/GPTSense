      Wow.. what a long day.  You know the day.. your in meeting all the time.  One after the other, after the other.  Crazy. Well, now having a moment to collect myself, it would appear that the months between now and december will entail a herculean development effort here at work.  I am sure I will derive some sick pleasure in that :p   Ok.. so this weekend looks to be a blast.  I have some new games to play (Battlefield 1942, Mafia, Asherons Call 2)  and i have a shindig to attend on Sunday night to watch the premier of the Sopranos at my friend Chris Shattuck's  I expect to see a bunch of old Abuzzers there and i look forward to an evening of good italian food (Chris is an excellent cook), good socializing, and a GREAT television show.  I don't think I will update these much on the weekends, but we'll see when inspiration strikes!

      Well I finally did it.  I put something in the russellminer.com root.  I am sure several of you who have meandered to this site in the past year or so have been befuddled at the apparent lack of a website.  In truth, I have developed a fan website for a game i play, World War II Online, at  urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/acec , as well as use the website to host random tidbits I work on from time to time.  This includes projects that fall under my part time passion to become a games developer ( urlLink http://www.infinitemonkeystudios.com ) and assorted other goodies that stem from my full time passion of being a games player :) .  I hope that through this web log (blog), i will actually make this site something friends, family, and random folks may enjoy popping in on and knowing whats up in the life of Russell Miner.

      Oh.. I am so excited! Today i leave work about 4  to head up to New Hampshire.  I am very glad to get into some green (or fall colors since I hear they are turning already).  It should be quite a trip.  ----  I take a martial art called Oom Yung Doe, and last night was a test prep lesson, and that means sometime in the future, i will be having my test to move up a "belt".   In actuality, this martial art uses what to me, seems a more authentic belt system.  Basically they claim that the origin of the black belt, is that a student, who would wear a white belt, over enough time (typically years), would actually stain their belt black with sweat and dirt as they worked out and trained.  The practitioners who had trained hard and long enough would have "black belts", hence the moden understanding.   So at this school, as you progress up, a section of your belt is dyed black.  There are eight sections to dye, such that when you are 8th section, you are a first degree black belt.   Chris and I will be testing for our first section.   And judging on the "review" lesson, I would say we have some practicing to do ;p  ------  Interesting thing happened to chris and I last night.  We both awoke at about 3 in the morning to the smell of a wood fire.  I suspect that a house somewhere not too terribly far was on fire, but my 3 am glances outside didnt find anythnig.  What I thought was so interesting, was how the smell of smoke, wafted in from the outside, was enough to trigger both of our brains to complete awakeness.  Like some animal instinct that something was amiss..and our brains knew it was fire.   Neat.  -----  My gaming link today is for a technology demo of a new game being developed called Midway.  There are not too many naval sims out there.  And no-one.. and I mean NOONE has yet to make water look truly realistic when ships are on it, and smashing through it with cannon fire.   That is until this game.  ZANG.  I encourage anyone even remotely interested in games to check this out.  It is really quite something.  The sounds are also great!     urlLink http://www.fileplanet.com/files/110000/113089.shtml   (link comes to us courtesy of David Della Bitta, my partner in gaming goodness)

      HELLO HELLO HELLO!!  Its a morning.. and I am drinking coffee.  I love coffee.  Dunkin Donughts Coffee is amazing.  Its no Jamaican Blue Mountain.. but I save that for weekends.    So whats happening in life... lets see...   my buddy  urlLink Jay Brewer  has done a re-design of his site.  Kinda creepy.. but deffinitely cool looking.   Make sure you stop into his movies section.  All sorts of no-good there :)  ---  My plans for Mt Washington have been coming along nicely.   We have further documentation about the route.. nice maps.. and a gread guide.  The Appalacian Mountain Club (sp?) has a guide the the White Mountains that is very nice.  Excellent trail descriptions.  It should be quite an adventure.   If I live, I'll be sure to post plenty on it :)  ---  Tonight is the loved tradtional Drinkin' Wednesday.   A bunch of my pals and I like to gather at a local bar and have a few while we enjoy each other's company.  It has been a few Wednesdays since we have done it, so it was about time.  This week looks to be the Cambridge Common.. always a good time.     ---   I am reading about J2EE architecture at work.  If you dont know what that is, dont fret.  J2EE is a platform upon which you develop software.  Basically a set of specifications to design Java code to.  I am VERY glad to be moving our product away from the old-style ASP that we have been trapped with since I started.  OH HEY.. on that note.. my YEAR has passed!  *happy vesting day*  YAY!!  We'll see ifone day that is worth something more than a nice lunch :)  So the herculean design effort continues.. with the herculean developement effort to follow close behind.  ---  Gmaing stuff:  urlLink Mafia  is a FANTASTIC game.  It plays a little like  urlLink Grand Theft Auto 3 , only mafia feels more like a movie that you play, where GTA3 was a random running amok in a virtual city.   Someday we can talk about my views on violence in video games in further detail, but for now, lets just say that I think the violence does not bother me in general.    Mafia is a mobster game set in the 30's, in the height of mob rule.  Authentic cars, and period city streets abound in a virtual city called Lost Haven.  The plot is driven along as you play out the role of "Tommy" a taxi driver, coerced into helping mobsters in a getaway.. then deciding later to give the life of crime a try.  The cinematics are nothing short of stunning in their presentation.  The game plays out as Tommy recants his life of crime to a detective.  His plan is to get out of the mafia for good, and he intends to turn over evidence to convict the don, Salieri.  As Tommy flashes back to his life and how it is what it is, you jump in the drivers seat to play out car chases, and shootouts that Tommy is referring to.  All in all.. great characters, great gameplay, and great graphics.   Solid game, and I reccommend it.   Ok.. thats it for now.. BACK TO J2EE!!

      Chris's shindig was wonderful.  The Sopranos was fantastic, and so were the meatballs.  Nuff said  :)  Chris.. you and Barbara ROCK!  ----  I got a note from Dee, a old friend from school, this past weekend.  My first reunion thanks to this blog :)  Dee is a peach of a woman who all but completely runs the day to day operations of the  urlLink Student Senate of the University of Rhode Island , a body I served on for two years.  Dee had spread the rumor that she would finally retire from her position after my senior year at school, but apparently she is a glutton for punishment, and has remained to keep another student government from shooting itself in the ass.  *good luck*  ;p  Seriously though, it was great to hear from her and hear how some other x-senators are faring in life after college.  ----  Christina (my lovely fiance) and I have made plans to head to the White Mountains this weekend.  I have been wanting to go camping all summer, and now that fall is here, we finally found the time to scrape together.  The plan is to stay at a campground in Glen, NH, and on Saturday morning, drive to the base of Mt. WAshington, and see how far we get hiking up it.   I plan on limiting us based on ability (we may get too tired.. it is said to be a moderate to strenuous hike), time, and weather.   If any of those conditions get too tough, we will turn around.. drive back to our happy family campground, and call it a day.   I look forward to a challenging hike, and some time away from tvs and computers.  Oh.. and I want to poke a fire with a stick.   Yes.. its the simple things :)   My link for you today (not that i will always have one mind you) is  urlLink http://www.gorp.com .   This site is pretty nice for all your outdoor needs.  You can shop (i hear prices are very good *even used stuff!*), plan trips, or just find general information.  If you sign up (free) they even print you topographical hiking maps.. VERY nice feature.  Here is the trail we plan to hike:  urlLink http://gorptools.gorp.com/gorpApps/trails/trails_template.asp?trailid=3478  And info on the White Mountains in general:  urlLink http://gorp.com/gorp/resource/us_national_forest/nh_white.htm

      Well its been a few days since i have updated this one, so I'll throw out something to my lovely readers...Ok mom, listen up..  ;p  Interesting factoid:    The emoticon  ": - )"   turned 10 a few days ago. The guy who invented it (and has the old data tapes to prove it) said he made it up to convey the fact that he was saying something in jest when he was posting on bulletin boards.    As we all know many times in text, a joke doesnt quite come across very well.   Thanks to that guy for inspiring a whole lexicon for emtions via  short text.   ---  Ben Folds' new live album is coming out on October 8th.  The cover features the audience showing him the bird as he recoils.  The picture is pretty funny, and even more so because I was at the show where he came up with it, and somewhere (out of frame I think) I too am flicking off Ben.   If you have never heard Ben Folds, he is an AMAZING piano player.  His music is deffinitely rock, and his old group Ben Folds Five also featured bass and a drum.  His lyrics are usually very interesting, and when you see him live, he will sometiems explain them.  They all come from some story in his life, or the lives of his close friends.  Warning.. he does swear.  ANyway.. the album cover can be seen at the link below.. though dont bother trying to purchase the album from the store there.. their website stinks and I cannot get it to work right.  (maybe by the time you click the link it will work)   urlLink http://www.sonymusicdirect.com/SMDProdDetails.asp?ProdID=83073&t=1669&UID=2670676   -----  About a year ago, I took my digital camera on a ski trip to Stowe.  After the cold, the camera seemed to not work properly.  I was convinced that I broke it, and after several attempts to use it, its behavior was erratic.  I was pretty upset as you can imagine.   THe way to fix it would be to mail it to Kodak and have them do some presumably expensive work on it, if it could be saved at all.  Needless to say, i procrastinated on sending it and spending any money on a camera that I had already spent a considerable amount on.    On a whim last night, I took out my digital camera, which has laid dormant, threw in some new batteries (and yes I had tried new batteries before) and she worked perfectly!  I was more than siked.  I am guessing the camera had time to let any moisture inside it finally evaporate totally.  YAY!  So expect some pictures of me, chris, our cat, and my friends at sometime in the future.  -----  Lastly, a big congratulations goes out to my friends Ryan and Jodi Miller in Ohio, they moved back to Ohio from Boston in order to be closer to family as they started their own.  And on last Monday, Jodi gave birth to a healthy baby boy.  Jabe  was 8 lbs, 14 oz and this pic is the little man, Jodi and Jabe.  ;p  (j/k ryan ;p)     Congratulations guys, and we miss you too!

      Well, we're alive!!   Now for the long post telling of our adventures on Mt Washington.  If you want to skip.. the skinny is Christina and I had a great time and we made it up!  Now.. the long version: --- Friday  Our trip to Mt Washington , New Hampshire, begins in Maine.  Yes.. Maine.  It would seem that whereas my map clearly shows 93 in New Hampshire, it apparently does some fancy foot work and ends up in Maine.  After  aquick stop at the Maine visitors center, and some lady behind the counter who runs into this problem so often there is a stack of printed directions to where we want to go, we head back into New Hampshire.  It gets dark as we hit Rochester, so let that be a lesson.. if you leave at 4:30, you cannot get anywhere north of rochester while there is still daylight.  After calling the campground to make sure they are still going to be open if we dont make it by 8, we finishe the hour and a half north and arrive just after 8:10 at the Glen Ellis Campground in Glen, NH.     After driving in the dark, shining our lights on hapless campers for about 20 minutes, we manage to find our water front campsite and settle in.   We managed to pitch the tent, setup some chairs and make a fire.  I poked it with a stick a few times, we had a marshmallow, and went to bed early, knowing that Saturday was a big day.  --- Saturday  We thought that setting the travel alarm for 7 am would be a good idea, as it would give us plenty of time to grab a bite,  pack up our gear, head to the mountain and start on the trail nice and early, but nature decided to get us up earlier.   At about 6:45 acorns began pelting our tent and the surrounding ground as two - five, rather burly looking red squirrels were trying to make daily collections.  We cursed them, then took the hint, and got on the road by about 8:00.  Entering White Mountain National Forest was lovely, there was a morning mist, and at times, we could see the peaks.  Each time we saw one we though.. maybe thats it... no maybe that one...  then it hit.  Whichever peak we saw, no matter how intimidating, ours was going to be at least that high.. or higher.   *rock*  We finally identified Washington as the only one with antannea on the top of it.. and the giant hotel saying "Mount Washington Hotel" at the base of it.  We started in off the main higway along the base road.  It at this time that I need to tell you about the millions and millions of signs in NH and Maine that say "Moose Crossing"  and.. "Brake for Moose".  I have been to Maine and New Hampshire many, many times.. in as backwater places as they come, but never had I seen a moose out there.  Well folks.. they dont have those signs up for nothing.  As we are traveling on the base road, as we joke about the moose signs for the 100th time, Chris says.. wow, it would be cool to see one.  I agree saying I had never seen one.    Sure enough about 5 minutes later.. I halt the car.. and about 50 yards ahead on the side of the road a big brown moose is hanging out.   As I halt, it stares at me.   *no antlers.. must be female* I think.   Then Chris gets her whits and grabs the camera which was, of course, in the least accessible place at the time.   Thankfully the moose holds his position and Chris snaps one.   Then we see the second moose.  This one is clearly a smaller moose.. we guessed that it was a juvenile that was out with mom for a morning stroll.      I approach and they dont seem to be moving... then after a couple honks.. they get the drift, and decide its safe for them to cross and they do.   Man..Moose run like girls.  They are the most ungainly beast i have ever seen.  Its like watching a horse on stilts.  But ungainly or not.. once they passed into the woods on the other side, we couldn't see any sign of them again.   We  got some pics.. hopefully they came out, and in the future I will post em.  We arrive at the parking area for trails, pay our parking pass to the self serve slot, visit the very stinky outhouse, and hit the trail at 8:40.  NICE!!  The first thing to hit us as we get into the woods is the overwhelming scent of pine.  It is amazing, very strong, and it reminds me of christmas.    Now about 10 minutes in, on a trail that is not too steep, we are short of breath.  Chris is the first to admit it .. and we laugh *nervously* about the trail ahead.  We are crazy.. huffing 10 minutes in.    Let the record show the first official break  was at 20 minutes in.. for water, and to take the bottoms off our Sahara Pants. (FYI.. the  urlLink BEST pants I have ever hiked in )  After continuing on for about a mile, through your average hiking path in the woods, we met up with the Amonoosuc River.  It is a nice little river (more like a brook or a big stream) and it was to be our companion for the rest of the trip till we hit the Alpine Zone.   Following the river we passed a big group of kids and adults.. some kind of field trip I bet.    The hiking was occasionally interrupted with river views, and small falls but the good stuff didn't start until we hit Gem Pool.  This lovely pool was at the base of a 15-20ft cascade and it was lovely.  Chris and I stopped here for a photo op. (one of the few we actually took with us in them.)  After the group we passed caught up, we decided it wa time to leave them behind us and get moving.  Now.. the AMC book on the Amonoosuc trail notes that the portion after the gem pool is steep.  Steep is barely the word to begin it :)  We climbed up staricase after staircase of wood and boulder steps that were about a foot high each.  This went on for the better part of the next hour.  We were occasionally rewarded with openings in the trees that afforded views into the ravine we had been climbing.  each time we stopped to look we were amazed at the height which lay below us.    Finally the stairways abated, and we crosed over a brook that fed the Amonoosuc and stared up large slabs of rock.  They were not too steep, but some tricky footing was around, and a slip would certainly have been ... lets say .. bad.. as below the slippery rocks were the many waterfalls and cascades we had passed on the way.  As we crested one anonymous slab, we came across a small sign.  It read "Welcome to the Alpine Zone"  kind of like.. "Welcome to New Hampshire".. it was kind of silly.. but it was also rewarding.  The sign went on to warn of where you tread as this area was a delicate one.   We pressed on.  All of a sudden as we went over another rock, Chris let out a shriek (the excited kind) and I looked up from the trail to see the top of the  urlLink Lakes of the Clouds Hut  .  It was closed for the winter.. but it gave the mental shelter of konwing we had hit a big milestone.  We climbed up to it.. hunkered down and decided it was a good time to break for some snacks.    Now it may seem that i am exxagerating here.. but this is the events as I whitnessed them:  I sit down and admire a view over the ravine.  I notice a whisp or two of cloud comign in over the land. .. and hitting it..  I realize I am in the clouds at this point.   *cool*    I turn to get some food from my pack.  I turn back.. and My visibility which was previously about a mile+  turned to 20 feet.   3 minutes.. I swear.   Let that be a lesson to those who thing the weather wont come fast on Mt Washington.  We joked with a nearby hiker about how fast it had come.  Marveleed a little more.. then started on the Crawford Path which was a 1.1 mile jaunt to the summit.  YAY!  The path had a only a slight uphill grade, but it was all rock.  and by all rock, i mean it looked like the bottom of a rock quarry.. only with some lichen and moss.  Cairns (piled of rocks used ot mark trails where there are no trees) were spaced about 20 feet apart and were eary to track.  We could see one cairn ahead in the fog, and *just* make out the second one if we strained.  It was like being on some other planet.   We tridged forward.  Deffinitely feeling tired at this point.. but nothing to do but press on.     At this point we came a cross a scary sign.  It said  (more or less) "Many hikers die on this trail.  If weather is bad.. turn back now".  Kind of a stark reminder that your not messing around here.  Besides the fog (which we figured would blow over)  the weather was warm.  We had gear for worse weather, so we pressed on.  Finally, as mysteriously (and quickly) as the fog arrived, it passed.  We were left with views of the hut we left behind (it seemed so painfully close), the summit ahead (also painfully close) and the vast expanse of rocky ground between both.   We could see Bott Spur and Mt Clay behind us and pretty much everything to the west of us.  There were great looking trails marked by a great line of cairns up to Bott Spur, it was sweet looking.   But our trail lay ahead.. and as we reached our last sign before washington, the cone of the summit loomed ahead.  .5 Miles to Mt Washington Summit.  And what a long .5 miles it is ;p  By this time, people from other trails had joined up with this path, as it is a main ascent up the final cone.  We encouraged each other as we passed, or were passed.  The climb was all broken rock.. and all steps up.  We were looking at our 4th hour of straight hiking.  We had ascended over 3500 feet and the fatigue was starting to set in.  At this point, we made the decision, that while we could probably hike back down.. why the hell should we.. we were going to try and get a ride down on the Cog Railway.  But enough of the way down.. we had to finish going up!  A final push (with a few stops to catch out breath) we made it to the visitors center!  Then feeling very good, we walked up the final path to the true summit.. and had the obligatory sumit photo op.  Now.. up at the summit, there are lots of tourists.  They drove up.. they rode up.. and at that time I hated them all :)  I was just thiking.. I WALKED UP!!  Those other hikers knew how I felt.  Now.. a headache had started in my head about 40 min into the hike.  It was probably due to extra blood pressure on my head.. as I had plenty of water the whole time.  By the summit, the neck tension of watching the ground, and the constant push had turned my headache into a wicked motha'.  We rode the  urlLink cog railway down.  (not as scary as one would think, except the price.. which is $35 one way down!!!) and then at the bottom we had to walk another quarter mile back to the parking lot.  We peeled off our packs, and got in the car.  the ride back was uneventful, though my head was pounding and nausea had set in... thank you migranes.   We arrived back at the campground, I took a shower and took a nap to lose the skull pain.   It didnt work, but thankfully it went away about 20 minutes after my nap.   All in all I was very sore, but the headache gets all the attnetion here because it was far worse than any muscle pain.   Chris was pretty sore as well, and moving around last evening was a silly sight, but we were deffinitely ok.  Chris had managed to make a nice fire while I napped (yay Chris!) and we sat and ate dinner over it.  After dinner over the campfire, since we were still not tired, we decided to head to a bar that was across the street from the campground.  We both ordered a margarita  and after a long day of hiking, they were relaxing and had us giggly after one.  We headed back, crawled into bed... and I was alseep before i knew it.  --- Sunday    In the middle of the night the rain came.  It cmae down pretty hard at some points, but my little  urlLink zoid  held out, snug as a bug in a sleeping bag.  By morning it had stopped raining, but I knew that more was on the way.  We woke about 8, and decided to head back early since we knew rain was coming, and I wanted to catch the Pats if I could  :)   We took our time getting home, stopping in some shops as we wanted, and I got home in time to see the Pats win a nailbiter in overtime.  *YAY*.  Great weekend.... Great Hike.. and quite an adventure.      Final Stats -- Start 8:40 AM   Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail Head   2560 Ft.  Finsh 1:00 PM  Mt Washington Summit   6288 ft  Total Time:  4:20 Total Elevation: 3728 ft Total DIstance: 4.1 mi   (oh.. and Pats: 41  KC : 38   in Overtime  )

      Well, not alot going on this week.   We had a pleasant "Drinkin' Wednesday" at a lovely place called the Enormus Room.  It was very laid back and "comfy". --- Chris and I are basking in the wonderful space of our new living room.  The re-arrangement and the paint job did the room wonders. --- My buddy  urlLink Jay Brewer  has a site he's been working on called  urlLink Fast Food Fever .  One day for lunch this week, we went to McDonalds and had a photoshoot.  Expect to see plenty of rediculous content on that site in the coming weeks. --- Today is really dark and crappy out, and its effecting my mood.  I hate that.  Here's to a sunny tomorrow!

      Another busy weekend.   I did a  bunch of work on our video game with Jay on Saturday morning.  I painted Saturday afternoon.  I picked up some new unfinished furniture (small tables and such for the living room) and painted more on Sunady.   Oh.. and I saw the Patriots lose their all wins record :(     I also spent some time tonight organizing all the pictures I took of the Mt Washington hike, the painting of the living room, and some random shots I took of our cat :)  It turns out Photoshop has a sweet auto-gallery maker, and I took full advantage of it.  You can find the links here:   urlLink Our Cat, Aurora..aka.. Goiter.    urlLink Painting the Living Room    urlLink Mt Washington Hike   Enjoy!

      This weekend we saw an a cappella concert in concord.  The Tufts Beelzebubs were great, the other 3 groups.. while talented, weren't as interesting.    --  Again the pats lose.   That was a painful game to watch.  painful.  --    Jay put up the next cuisine at  urlLink Fast Food Fever   The McNugget Burger.  I wrote the article and chronicled its makeup.   I also suffered through the indigestion afterwards ;p  ---  I finally picked up a copy of  urlLink Empire Earth  this past weekend.  I like it.  I dont know how long it will hold me.. but it IS nice.  There are just scads of units in the game, and it makes for some interesting battles ;)  ---

      Again, I am sorry this is so late in coming, but life has been rather busy lately :)  First, Christina got our future wedding party together to get to know each other and have a good time at Nashoba Valley.  Unfortunately, it poured rain, was freezing cold, and the resturant was booked solid.  DOH!  We had a great time anyway though :)  Thanks to everyone who came.  Here are the images:   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/galleries/nashobaValley/frameSet.htm      And here are the pics from Mindy's party on the Bay Queen!   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/galleries/mindysParty/frameSet.htm

      I'm alive.. I swear.  I have been away from the blog for a bit.  Expect it to happen again.  Its the kind of thing where when I feel that there is nothing particularly interesting to report, I just wont.  There really isnt much to report right now anyway.. but here are the headlines:  ----  My sister's birthday was a week ago.  She turned 30!  YAY!  We had a nice party for her on the  urlLink Bay Queen  in Rhode Island.  It was a nice time, thouh the water was a little choppy.  Expect pictures in the next few days.  ---  Hilbilly Whack, the game my pal Jay and I have been working on is looking GREAT and deffinitely entering its final stages of development.  We have worked on it in our spare time here and there when we have it, and it is really coming together.  The plan of the game was to approach simple atari-style graphics with solid atari-styled gameplay to try out game ideas rapidly.  Artwork takes WAYY too much time than what 2 people can turn out (only 1 being a designer) and atari graphics make that process much simpler.  Plus with the nostalgia effect of Atari.. it works out nice ;)  I will post the whole thing when it is ready to be released..expect it by sometime in the next couple months, probably before the holidays.  ---  Chris and I have our costumes all set for this week.  (got a party this weekend and I am looking forward to it)  I also will be going to a non-Halloween party at my friend Paul's house and it will be great to see him as well.  Our costumes are not that "clever" per se, but they should be fun anyway.  Turns out I could not find a shark costume (or enough of one to build off) so we scrapped the chris as the diver russ the shark attacked, and instead with Chris the cult witch thing who summoned Russ the demon.   Not terribly original, but chris looks good, and I look scary.    VERY scary :)    Pictures will follow the party.. no worries.  ----  Well thats it for now!

      Halloween.  Nice.    Here are some pics form our costumes.  We had a great time at my friend Dennis' party.  Though tonight we actually didnt do too much except watch the four kids come by to get candy.  FOUR!!  I have more fingers than that!!!   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/galleries/halloween/

      Another weekend down, and finally the Pats break their 4 game losing streak!  YAY!  And to beat Bledsoe and the bills.. that was just icing.  And to beat them 37-7... the cherry on top.  Sweet.  ----  Jay and I continue to make progress on HIlbilly Whack.   Each time we revisit the file, we make forward steps, even when its not visible to the end player.  In this last round, we implemented a indea Jay had to make labels on all our little clips so that we can access them easier in the editor.  ----- Today's Link is from a friend of mine...  Clay Johnson and I have a long history.  Among other things, Clay has been my roomate, and my boss.  Clay is also a pretty smart guy.  He has a nack for coming up with interesting business ideas based on technology, and typically the Internet.   He founded HumanSearch, which I was a co-founder, and employee for some time.  When HumanSearch didn't pan out, he bounced around at different places, but i am glad to say he is back in the saddle trying to make companies on Net technology.   His latest brainchild is  urlLink http://www.mp3newsbreak.com   .    This is a very neat little app.  Basically it works like this:  I install the MP3Newsbreak Winamp plugin. I indicate which newsfeeds I would like to know about. I listen to my MP3s as I normally would.  When news breaks, the plugin inserts an approx. 1 minute news clip after my currently playing song.  Plays it next.. then deletes it from the list after it is done.  In essense, my normal MP3 playing habits are augmented with breaking news without me even thinking about it.   Now this may seem trivial, but it is actually a very cool and powerful utility.   You can easily imagine subscribing to a CNN for newsbreaks, or a some Wall Street news agency to report the latest stock news, or a Sports Illustrated channel for the latest box scores.   All while I am just listening to music like I always would.  The service costs money (I think about $4 a month) which is pretty cheap if you ask me.  Though I must warn you that the product is still in its early stages.  It can have bugs (though I havent seen many), and probably least attractive at the moment, Clay and his other employee read the news.  It will be nice when they can outsource the reading, or hire a nice voice actor :)       In the meantime, other than the occasional mispronunciation or vocal flub, the service is quite neat.  I encourage anyone who does listen to MP3s to check it out.

      Well, I'll take a moment to post something since it has been wayyy too long.  -----  Work has become... stressful.  VERY stressful.  Lots of late nights.  Lots of last minute changes to things.  *shrug* guess that just happens from time to time.  ------  Christina's Birthday is coming up!  *yay*   I am looking forward to giving her the present I got her :)  ------  Christmas is fast approaching!  I will post a list I have put together so that any family out there who are really stuck can have a place to turn to for ideas.  *coming soon!*  ------  The latest game in my world is O.R.B.  it is a beautiful 3d real tiem strategy set in space.  It is more or less a clone of Homeworld, but it is nice and has some excellent features that make it different.  And like homeworld, the visuals are nothing short of stunning.   urlLink http://www.o-r-b.com/   And as a bonus, it is from my favorite publisher ... Strategy First :)

      Well I hope everyone had a lovely Thanksgiving.  I spent time with Christina and My familes.  It was lovely :) *and the pats won! yay*  Christmas is fast approaching, work has remaind rather busy, and I really havent taken the time to update this site.  It may be that that will more of the norm, so to those of you who do come by regularly, I apologize.  ---  A book I have been reading lately called Cryptnomicon by Neal Stephenson.  I like Neal alot, and this book has not dissappointed.  If you are at all technical, or interested in cryptology, i highly reccommend it.  ---  Star Wars Episode II on my local Imax theatre was simply phenominal.  Sure seeing the blemishes on Ewan McGregor's forehead could have been skipped, but the hum of the lightsares in such resounding base that it vibrates my clothing was something i very much enjoyed.  The sound systems in those theatres are nothing short of breathtaking.   I would like to go back soon and see the IMAX movie shot on the space station.  Though I doubt chris will come.  She gets motion sickness sitting still on the couch, I doubt watching larger than life shots of zero G scienists will be much good for her :)  ---  Metroid Prime for the Gamecube is phenominal.  For that matter so is Asherons Call 2 for the PC.  I havent been able to spend as much time as I would like playing games recently, but when I have had time, it is generally going to those two games.  Metroid is similar enough to the original metroid in its feel, that is brings waves of nostalgia.   Though it is also different enough to make it cutting edge.   urlLink AC2  is an MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game..and thats the last time i write that)   it is graphically stunning, and the gameplay is well thought out and actually fun.  I also play on a  Kingdom vs. Kingdom server, which adds a whole new dynamic.  The nice thing about AC2 is that is has a good story.  The world of Dereth was overrun during the finale of Asherons Call 1, and now.. a hundred years later, the players play the roles of the inhabitants emerging from underground shelters to find their planet rather demolished.  All the cities are in ruin.. and monsters have overrun several sections of the planet.  Our job is to rebuild the world, and restore order.  PLayers can choose to join one of four kingdoms to create a grander scope to the game.  The kingdoms war with each other as they all try to rebuild portions of the world, and retain control over them.  All fun stuff :)  ---  My xmas shopping is mostly done.  ONly a few more presents to get.  This year I felt rushed.. mainy because so much of my time is chalked up to one thing or another.   I should be able to squeeze in the last bit of shopping sometime this weekend or next.  *yay crowds*.  ---  And finally.. as i have helped contribute to FastFoodFever.com  I though i would proudly annonce that it has made Yahoos directory.. and it got on some yahoo featured site email.. and now we have had over 15,000 people hit the site today.   Very cool..  Congrats to Jay on it.  Its his baby :)  urlLink http://picks.yahoo.com/picks/i/20021212.html

      Welcome to march!  I have dug out of the snow-ridden Februrary, and i am sooo ready for spring! ---- I survived a round of lay-offs at work (28 down to 20 people! ouch!)  And we're trying to make the best of it, pick up the pieces, and come back swinging!  GO US! ---- Jay and I have made amazing progress on our gaming work.  Our website is up for or group,  urlLink http://www.smallfrystudios.com , and we hope to have our first game, "HIllBilly Whack: Save Whinny May" out this spring.  Things look great to meet that target  :) ---- I have been playing  urlLink Command and Conquer Generals  as of late  and having tons of fun.  Its a solid Real Time Strategy game, and worthy of the legacy of the Command and Conquer series. ---- I am upgrading my machine at home.  YAY!  It will be some fancy hardware working inside, replacing the motherboard, CPU, and adding some ram.  BUt I think I can do it.  ANd when I'm done i may be able to rebuild my 3rd machien with new parts since it has fried in the meantime :( ----  Wedding plans are going well, we have invitations chosen, and now the big thing is the wording on the invitations, and also the rehersal dinner location.  Many are in the air, and unfortunately many are being shot down.  It seems that every location is changing ownership this year.  Maybe its a good time to buy resturaunts.. who knew :)  Thats all for now. Feel free to drop me an email any time.   urlLink website@russellminer.com

      OH boy.. new pics!  I promised the pictures of my machine's surgery, and here they are! Boy she looks good now in her all aluminum case.. with blue lighting.  HOT!   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/mainSite/galleries/newRig/FrameSet.htm   Overall, the case is a little noisy (with 3 fans..thats not shocking).  But the preformance i am getting makes up for it.  The third machine which was previously dead, is now being partially resurrected with the motherboard and 1ghz chip from my old machine.  Chris will likely upgrade to it slowly, as she hates the trauma of switching machines.  (dont we all).    Luckily for me, after all the installation work I only had to "repair" my windows install that means i didnt lose any data (SWEET!).  I did however, lose some hardware, my old A drive got dropped... but who needs it!! (note the new rig is sans A drive!  GO evolution!)  Enjoy the pics and c u later!

      Phew!  Its been a very busy time for me.  And an exciting one too!  Lets see if we can't play catchup:  ----------------  Friends in New York   A while ago Chris and I managed to head up to Upstate New York to visit our friends (Ryan and Jodi) who moved to Ohio.  You may wonder why we would meet friends from Ohio in New York, but it turns out to be about the halfway point between us.   We rented a house on Lake Seneca, and after several adventures, including getting lost, ice storms,  losing power, and spending plenty of time with Jabe (Ryan and Jodi's new baby boy) we returned home safely.    Chris and I went up a day early and stayed at a lovely place called White springs manor in Geneve, NY.   We even had a chance to sneak up (8 hours of sneaking!) to Niagra Falls during a wonderful ice storm.  It was alot like... look the falls.. click... get back in the car its freezing!!    A gallery of my pics are below.   White Springs Manor   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/mainSite/galleries/whiteSpringsManor/FrameSet.htm    Niagra Falls   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/mainSite/galleries/niagraFalls/FrameSet.htm    Millers and Co. in NY   urlLink http://www.russellminer.com/mainSite/galleries/millersInNy/FrameSet.htm    ----------------------  Wedding Stuff   Wedding plans are going great.  We have the invitations in hand, and now we jsut have to fill them out and send them. We also have dates set for the Jack and Jill party (I belive its August 23rd, but dont quote me i am an idiot with dates).    We have registered at several places.  Crate and Barrel, Linens and Things, Kitchens Etc, and Sears.  All of them have websites, and now.. so do we!  You can always find out what the latest is on our wedding at  urlLink http://www.russandchris.com .  Now we need to get rings, and get cracking on those invites!   -----------------------------------  Poker  I have found a new fascination...  Low Limit Texas Hole 'Em!  It started by watching the World Poker Tour on the Travel Channel.. ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING!!!    I reccommend you see this show, it is really amazing to watch.  Though in professional poker, they play no-limit, so the show is much more exciting.  So now my little group of friends who likes to play poker every so often are trying to master Texas Hold em.  Its a ton of fun, and when wer're not laughing at each other's poker faces, we are actually doing pretty well.   --------------------------  Hilbilly Whack   My last little update is in regards to the game my friend Jay and I have been working on, HIllbilly Whack.   We are getting close.  Finally close enough that I can actually see the work we've done over what is almost a year.  I am not trying to toot my own here.. but i think it will be a ton of fun, and frankly I think we have made somethign in Flash, that really isnt out there at the moment.      And the best part is, the system we made can be re-used to make more adventures for our Hickboy Jones :)    So hang in there folks.. .HBW is deffinitely coming soon.  I estimate we'll slip from the spring we were shooting for, but not by much.  Late May, to mid June, and you'll all see what we've been up to.  For a preview.. head to  urlLink http://www.smallfrystudios.com .  Thats it for now!

      Catch up time:   ------------------------  Wedding Stuff   Christina's Aunt Linda and Uncle Paul through her an amazing shower.  It was a very beautiful affair with a tea party theme.  Catering, a tent, teacups, flowers, a cake, and a string duet made it very classy indeed.   For my part, I was inside fixing a toilet, getting a tour of Paul and Linda's home to learn more about inspecting a house, and i was occasionally paraded outside to show my face for one embarassing game or another.   Good times :)  Seriously though, I would like to thank Paul and Linda (and Porcha!) for putting on a real nice shower, that I know chris, and my family all enjoyed.   And I also want to thank Paul for giving me a crash course in the internals of a house.     -----------------------------------  House Buying   Chris and I have come to the conclusion that we pay way too much rent, and its time to try to find a place to buy.   We have been looking in Arlington mostly, but we are also considering Medford, Watertown, and Belmont.   It is deffinitely an exciting process, and I am certainly learning alot about everything with my own finances, and with home buying in general.  Lots to learn.. and lots to do.   Also.. open houses are tons of fun :)   -------------------------------  Hillbilly Whack!   The whack is going VERY strong now.  We have completed Beta 1, and released a small batch of critical fixes to start Beta 2.   We have a definite game plan to get the other outstanding bugs fixed, and fill in the missing content.  Then we will be looking at fixes to gameplay problems.  Places that need some spice will get it.   We'll probably have one more small beta, then POW!  We'll release the game to fanfare, and Jay's amazing marketing skills.     Smallfry Studios is already seeing regular traffic comign in from  urlLink flashkit  and  urlLink gamasutra  which are both big industry sites.  Jay really is amazing with that stuff.      We also have plans to have a launch party when its time for the game to go live.  It should be a hoot. (we looked back at old work last night... wow we've come far).   -----------------------------  Poker   I have certainly gotten myself into small fads from time to time.  Heck, my entire video  gaming hobby is based on games that pass by in a week or two, but Poker seems like its here to stay.  I am now hosting a weekly Texas Holdem game that sports usually 10 and as many as 16 people!  Thats 2 tables!  Crazy.    We dont play with much money, but the plan is to learn the game well enough to head to foxwoods and try our hand at this very in depth game.  We are looking to play regular tables, as well as enter tournaments.  Foxwoods has tournaments that you can enter for as little as $35!  Here's to that noble goal :)  In the meantime, we are having lots of fun mastering the game, and learning its intricaces.     -----------------------------------  Video Games   The games you want to watch out for are the following:  Half Life 2 -- Jut delayed till Holiday 2003, but it has the most advanced physics engine I have ever seen.  THe original Half Life is possibly my facorite game, this one is sure to top it.  Horizons -- This one looks ot be out in the fall.  It is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game, and it has lots of features that make it seem like it will beat out the pack.  Since Star Wars Galaxies was such a let down, We are all very anxious to see this game and have a great time with it!   Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) -- This is an role playing XBox game from the makers of Baldurs Gate, and NEverwinter Nights.  It is a truly wonderful game, and it is alot of fun in the star wars universe.   What makes me even happier is it is the first great game i have gotten from  urlLink Gamefly .    Gamefly is a service like netflixx.  You rent games (up to 2 at a time) for a flat fee per month.  You can however, keep those two games out for as long as you like.  This means I am not spending money on crappy games that I play for only a day.  If I hate the game, i send it back and get the next one in line.   They only do console games, but that is ok with me.  Its a neat program, though you do have to be a regular gamer for it to really make sense.      Thats all for now.  Hope everyone is doing well out there!

Sometime i'll put up some pics of the new place.   Its a townhouse condo in a nice neighborhood in medford right next to Arlington.     It is about a block away from the Mystic River, which should provide for nice walking and biking scenery.  We are certainly dreading the move itself (who wants to pack boxes!), but we couldnt be more excited to move into a place of our own.  At the moment we are waiting on the lawyers to complete the Purchase and Sale agreement, which wil hopefully be this week, though with the holidays who knows.

      Wow.. who knew people even read this!  Well after a friend of mine emailed me about the heart thing, I though I should clarify.  About a month ago i was at work doing nothing when my heart went into an ahhrythmia.  Very fast beating, and i had symptoms that seemed like a heart attack.   I went to the ER, and there they did a bunch of tests, all of which showed that i had a healthy heart.  After the initial "incident", i had a second "incident" but it was a bit less severe.  It turns out that while my heart was beating fast the other symptoms i had appear to have been indiciative of a panic attack.  As if to drive the point home, i had a mid sized panic attack at our condo closing ;p    So a month later, and the doc has me on a small amount of anti-anxiety medication to help me get over the hyper-sensitive feelings im having about my heart etc.   Long and short.. im fine, nothing serious.    Now... to give some more detail about other random things in life.. since its been a while...  ---- The cat is  NOT  happy about the boxed being everywhere.  She has in recent months begun to come out more when strangers are around, and I suspect we will revert her back to her isolationist mode when we move her.  Poor thing.  ---- Our weekly poker game is still rockin on.  We have been enjoying it greatly as a way for us to see our friends.. and take their money. (or more accurately GIVE them money!).  Of particular note, a friend of minde from work who had always watched poker from afar, but never played, got into it wiht us, and he has since surpassed us.   He plays online and has won several tournaments (no limit hold 'em) and even won a trip to Aruba to play in the World Poker Tour.    He also has been heading to Foxwoods on a semi-regular bais, and when visiting his brother, he played in the SouthWest recently.   The man is a machine.   All of us like poker, and we're all ok, but THIS guy is seriously PRO material.   I hope he is able to make the jump one day.. or at least keep it going as a fun and exciting way to earn a second income.     ----  On the gaming front:  Unreal Tournament 2004 's demo came out.  AMAZING.  THat game is terribly fun, and chris and I already have our copys pre-ordered.   Another friend of mine hosts lan partys and this is sure to be a regular there.  GREAT GAME.  Try the  urlLink demo  if you have not.   Chris and I are still playing  urlLink Horizons , though admittedly it has slowed quite a bit with the move and such.  Hopefully once we're all settled in, we can get more play time and get more into the game again.   It has its weaknesses, but overall its pretty solid.  My only beef withthe game is that it seems that grouping in the game is a bit harder than other games we've played.   Then again... if all goes well with a content update in march, the dragon i play shoudl be able to get the gift of flight.  BOOYA!   I'm still rockin with  urlLink WWIIOnline .  THis game again suffers from my attention span flopping all over with one game or another, but i dont think i'll ever cancel my account with it, as no matter how long between sessions, i always get on and have a great time. The latest patch adds visual damage modeling to aircraft, which is something the game has been missing since the beginning.   I mean.. when i shoot down a plane, nothing is more gratifying than seeing a wing shear off as the vehicle goes tumbling back to earth.  MMM good times.    Ground vehicle visual damage modeling is also coming in the near future.. so all is well there.  Games on the horizon:  UT2004 Full release: yum Half Life 2: wow.. this one can' come soon enough. Ultima X Odyssy: this is the new ultima online.. I think it will be sweet City of Heros:  Massivley mutiplayer online superheros.  what more can i say. Doom 3:  This game should be coming in the next quarter or 2.  It looks to be scary.   Guess thats it for now.  Thanks for reading, and expect the massive email about a change of address / phone number in the not too distant future.

      We got the condo!  We're moving thids saturday and the apartment is already filled with boxes.  In the meantime its been a very busy several months.  Christina suffered the loss of her grandmother, and I had a little heart trouble. But even with all that everything seems to be coming back together, we're both doing fine, and once we get into our new house we are looking forward to a return to normalcy.

      Sweet mother... the move is over!  *yay*  We still have boxes strewn about.. including the ones holding most of my clothes.. but the hard part is over.  Now for some answers to questions your sure to ask:   How was the move?  A week of living in boxes.  3 Days of lifting / packing / unpacking...   In short.. annoying.   But its over now.  And the fun times are ahead with setting up a new place.   We dont have as much closet space, but the place is bigger than we used to have, and its coming together nicely.   Neighbors?  We have met a few.  All seem nice.  There is this "gaggle" of high school kids who hang out on our street.  *shrug* They dont seem to rowdy, so im sure it will be fine.   Our condo neighbors are very nice.  THe couple next door to us already had a party (the night of our move) and Chris and I went over to meet their friends and welcome them into their home.   Also it didnt hurt to have a beer or two to ease the sharp pain in the back :)  I havent met the other condo neighbor, but chris has and she says hes nice too.   What did you unpack and setup first?  Contrary to every other move i have made, the computer was not the first thing to be set up.  This time it was Tivo.  It was Chris's idea.  I am so married.   Hows the cat?  Our cat was decidedly unhappy.  After sticking her face into a hidden corner of a closet and not moving for about 2 days, she has begun to move about without the fear of 3 short strong hispanic guys popping around corners (our movers).  She has made it to first and second floors, but the basement will have to wait for a more secure time.   Whats next ?  Its been a long few months.  Married..buying a first home...being sick... moving... It will be nice to settle in and get back into a normal routine.     Thats all for now.  If you havent gotten an email with our new address and phone number,  urlLink email me .

      Its been a week since we moved.  We are *almost* done with all the unpacking / setup. This weekend I was a monster with the drill and screwdriver and i mounted shelving , setup some closets with ClosetMaid stuff, put up hanging racks in the basement, setup washer and dryer, and setup our new entertainment center.  Bob Vila Eat your heart out.  I have to say that now I understand how people with houses always have a list of things they should do.  And how they can eat up a whole weekend of decently hard work fixing all this stuff.  I also understand how rewarding it is to have it all done and enjoy your new home :)  ROCK!

      The new house is so nice :)    Shoveling snow is not :(   Hopefully our last snowstorm of the year has passed us by, and i had the joy of shoveling (more like scraping since some was ice) and clearing our walkways.  Good times. :)  Dad hooked up a garbage disposal wich was acquired for free from my parent's neighbors and our family friends the Southers.  YAY!  This is a very powerful and very quiet model.  And dad's work was great (except the permanent purple spots on the floor  but meh.. it was free, and we can re-lanolium later anyway.)  He also helped install an outside vent for our dryer, and it looks very good.  It has occurred to me how luck I am to have a dad who can do these kinds of things.  He not only has saved us thousands of dollars, he is also a resource for my own learning and understanding of household work.   I know I'll never be as skilled in plumbing or electrician work, but its nice to know he is there to help me out.   Watching my neighbors has only deepended my thankfulness, as they are having trouble even getting someone in to hook up a washer and dryer.    On the gaming front, I've been putting some time into Horizons again.. it has be in its thrall.   Unreal Tournament 2004 has just arrived, and marks the first game purchase for some time.  It is a blast, and deffinitely wortth picking up.   I am sure it will be a favorite at our lan partys.  Im heading to see my sister this weekend.  She's cooking me a birthday dinner, and we'll be spending the night with her and her fiance.  Should be a good time.  This friday I intend to see the Dawn of the Dead remake... im sure ill get scared.. and thats why i have to see it.   Man.. zombies freak me out.  I wonder why.   Our local game enthusiast email group the monkeygames has started a gaming night on a semi-weekly basis.   We played rise of nations last night and had a great game.   I'm looking forward to the next time :)   All in all.. we're settling back into some normalcy.  The house is looking good.. and we're settling in well.    Ahhhhhhhhh..

      Ahh... we're enjoying our new place.  We even sat and ate dinner at... *drumroll* the dining room table! Amazing.  The sun streams in on weeknd mornings, and there was a decent spring breeze this weekend.  Very nice :)  What else is going on....   We have bought a new car for Christina.  Her old beauty.. (i call her Leviathan) was on her last legs, so we got Chris something new and nice.  A subaru Legacy '03.  Its slightly used, but its a very nice ride.  Poker is going well.  We had our neighbors over for the first time for a poker night.  I think they enjoyed it, though it turned out to be some night as we had 15 people.  Very busy.   Also it was Chris Schumacher's last night with us as he is moving to Anaheim to go make his way in the pro poker world.  We're all so proud of him, but we'll miss him.  Now... a cool poker story:  Last year, I went to Vegas with a bunch of friends.  This was back when the poker wave was still rising.  I had started playing, but all the friends I was with were not yet.   At any rate, I made it a point to head to Binions Casino and pop into a very high stakes tournament that was going on.  I brought Chris Schumacher's poker book with me.  I ended up meeting several poker stars, and i got them to sign Chris's book.  Well one of those guys is a player known as Antonio Esfandiari.  He had been new to the pro circuit, and I had seen him on TV.  I recognized him and asked for his autograph.  He was absolutely floored.  He was so excited because I was the first person to ever ask for his autograph.  He called his friend on his cell phone and told him right then and there that he was living one of his dream moments.  I was very happy for him, and pleased to have been the person to have done it.  So fast forward about a year.  Antonio recently won a large tournament and became a millionaire.  He was interviewed in Card Player magazine in March, and he relived that moment for the interview.  He said that it had been a lifelong dream to have someone ask for his autograph.  Well he didn't mention me by name in the article (he wouldnt know my name) but I recognized myself.. and that was cool enough.  Its like there being a picture of a famous person and you see someone's elbow just in frame.. and i can say.. "Thats my elbow!".    heh.  Well.. thats all for now.  Thank to everyone who reads this blog.. im always surprised anyone does.   We have a housewarming party soon, and we're looking foward to it!   Until next time!

      So when we were in Pensylvania, we found a couple cicadas buried in the ground. (which I promptly fed to hungry fish ;p )  Anyway.. i came across this site and thought it was cool.  When i was younger, i even remember the cicadas coming out of the ground in Rhode Island and covering the tent I was sleeping in.  My friend and I woke up to a tent covered with the shells of these creepy bugs with big front claws.    We'd even get live ones, and stick them on our shirts like pets.  Crazy.     urlLink Howstuffworks "How Cicadas Work"

      We just got back from Pennsylvania.  Great long weekend.  We spent it at Gifford Pinchot State Park, which it turns out has mutant sized carpenter bees, and is within the "blast radius" of Three Mile Island.  ROCK!  The place was wonderful.  It was green, it was warm, and I got to poke a fire with a stick.  What more can a guy ask for.  We also had a great group of people.  The Millers met us from Ohio and brought Jabe, he is still officially the cutest little boy on earth.  Also in attendance were Beauchamp and Danielle, Fico and Betsy,  Jordan and Kate, Heather and Chuck, and BItta.  Unfortunatly Caitlin had to bail last minute.  BOO!  We had a blast doing things like : Bocce.  Kickball.  Touch Football.  Hiking. Finding Dead Fish. (pictures to follow when i get a copy).  Poking a fire with a stick.  Sleeping.   Beer.  Seriously you dont know how much you miss nature and the smell of the woods and its noises until you go back into them and wonder why you live in the city at all.   GREAT weekend.  Pics to follow sometime.

      Wow.. so whats been up...  Well to begin with, We had a great house warming party.  I'd like to thank everyone who attended.  It was really a great time.  Unfortunatly during the party, we lost an electric circuit and because of that we have had an electrician in to repair it, as well as identify all the other hidden evil that was lurking in our walls.  It turns out there was quite a bit.  So now we're having a bunch of repairs and upgrades done.  Welcome to Home Ownership :)   At any rate, those are going well.  In other news, I also started up a new blog with some friends of mine that is concentrating specifically on games and game news.  Stop on by  urlLink http://www.monkeygames.org .  Guess thats it for now.  Hope everyone is doing well!

      So I finally decided to play some online poker.   Night 1 went swimmingly.   I was playing at a $.50/$1  limit holdem table.  I made $23 in 1.5 hours.   I must admit I feel like i have turned a corner in poker.  On my last trip to foxwoods I lost.  And while that may seem like a bad thing, I actually learned a TON on that trip.    First, I have successfully memorized  urlLink Mike Caro's Laws of Tells .  No joking, while I was there, I was able to read tells all the time.  And in several instances (lets say 7) I was able to act accoriding to the tells.  5 out of the 7 times, they worked distinctly in my favor, and on 2 times I was fooled and got burned.  But no tells are ever perfect, and I truly believe I was running that table and totaly in control for several hours.  The painful lesson I did learn however, was that after a few hours, I get sloppy and tired.   And I need to learn to just get out.    Hence my online poker regiment.  A set time limit of 2 hours.  A set limit of a max and a min money amount. (if I hit either, I leave).  All of these are just ways to keep myself disciplined.  The amazing thing is, it all seems so simple to me now.  If you play tight (meanign only stay in with good hands, never bluff, never chase..etc)  You can just wait out a pot.  Last night I only saw the flop on about 34% of the hands I was dealt.  That means I folded before the flop on 66% of the hands.  I was playing nice and tight.   Oh.. and I also won 16% of all hands that I was dealt, which means I won about half of the pots I played in.  And it turns out, I left pots early when they didnt work out.   Only about 2 times did I stay to the river to lose the pot.  Very good night.  Lets see if my strategy holds up.   Tight play.  Short Time Limits.  Follow my own rules.

      So less than a year after our own wedding, Chris and I are embarking on a wedding and wedding related party-filled summer.  Work is crazier than ever, and now the weekends are all jammed up too.   Don't get me wrong, its wonderful to have so many friends (and my own sister!) settling down with their loved ones, but man.. when it rains is sure does pour.  So My weeks will be crazy mind-numbing work, and my weekends will be a pretty persistant buzz of friends and partying.   WOW.. What the hell am I complaining about?!?!  :)   My first adventure is a bachelor-y round of Paint Ball with Paul.  Oh yeah.  That i can dig :)   Then I'm having my folks up later that night and I plan to cook dinner for them.  Good times.  Sunday?  Workign on stuff around the house I'm sure.    And then next weekend is wedding 1.   Time to press my suit :)

      Friday I was able to get some tickets to the red sox game.  I took Dave Beauchamp, and we had a great night watching the sox take the dodgers 2-1.    Saturday I took a bikeride along the Mystic River, which as it happens is right next to my house, and makes for some wonderful nature trails.  Its like finding a great little surprise in the land we just bought.  Chris and I are loving it.  Later on Saturday I went to Paul Drapeau's wedding.  It was a good time, and I have to say it was nice being at a wedding that I wasn't in.  Much more laid back.  I hope they are having a great honeymoon.    Sunday I ended up doing some work from home.  Boo.  But it wasnt too bad.  All in all, it was a pretty busy weekend.  And it was mighty nice.  Im looking forward to the rest of summer :)

      This morning, I decided to take a nice walk, get some D&D Coffee (god's gift to coffee lovers) and go hang out by the mystic river.  It was deffinitely a pleasant walk.    I headed left from my house up the river, knowing that there was a nice secluded area bout 3 min up the path where I could sit along the river and enjoy my breakfast.  When I got there, I looked out in the grassy field and notices something dark and out of place.  At first I thought it might be a snake, as there was what appeared to be a head poking up out of the grass.  Then as I got closer, I realized it was a big ole' painted turtle.  Very cool.  I managed to snap a few pictures of him (her?).   I got pretty close for the closest picture, but I didn't want him to get all hidden in the shell and disturbed, so after that I left him on his wild journey.

      So.. many of you may be familiar with the show Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  This was a phenomenal show, and I watched it unfailingly with a group of friends, Angel too for that matter.  At any rate, my bud Scott Weller had a bachelor party thrown by his dad.  As befitting a bachelor party thrown by your dad, there was plenty of good clean fun.  I expected corny sex jokes, lots of golf, and decent beer, what I didn't expect was to meet a dead ringer for  urlLink Anthony Head  (he playes giles on Buffy).  How fun.  He graciously accomodated me taking a few pics of him from my sidekick.  Note however.. that he wouldnt hold still.  You be the judge.

      As I have pointed out on my lovely wildlife pictures from Medford.&nbsp; We have this wonderful river about&nbsp;2 blocks from our house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every day I would drive past it and wish that Chris and I had a couple of Kayaks to tool around the water with.&nbsp; But naturally Kayaks are a little cost prohibitive.&nbsp; New ones range from 350-1000+ each, and used ones didnt seem much better.  &nbsp;  It turns out that our neighbors, Nathan and Miraim, also had been dreaming of kayaks.&nbsp; So we both "pooled" together and decided to buy one kayak each.&nbsp; Now to find used kayaks that werent total crap.  &nbsp;  Enter  urlLink Craig's List &nbsp;.&nbsp; How this site got so popular I have no idea.. but If you want classifieds or rides.. or pretty much anything else for a city, this is the site.&nbsp; We managed to find someone in Foxboro selling two used Kayaks for $250 each.&nbsp; WINNER!  &nbsp;  Nathan and Chris made it down there, tried them out, and POW.. we now own 2 kayaks.&nbsp; A couple life vests and paddles later, and we're good to go.  &nbsp;  After taking them out a couple times, Chris and I discovered one problem.&nbsp; We can work together to carry 2 kayaks down to the river entrance (both of us grab a handle on each kayak), but if we wanted to go alone, we couldnt see how to get the kayaks down there without killing ourselves (or involving a car which seems silly for 2 blocks).  &nbsp;  Enter :&nbsp; THE KAYAK HAND TOW  &nbsp;  I was thinking that all we needed to do was make something with two wheels on it, get it strapped to the bottom of a kayak, and we could tow it down the sidewalk to the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I am no engineer (at least if its not software ;p) so I wanted to modify something that was CLOSE to what we wanted to start with.&nbsp; My choice?&nbsp; A wheeled garbage Can.  &nbsp;  I began by cutting the can at an angle (so when the kayak rests on it, it is tilted for the wheels to work) .&nbsp; These pics are after the work.. i didnt think to get a starting shot.  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Next I take the bottom, carve out a couple curves, and drill some holes into the sides for a bungee cord.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  Strap it to about the middle of the Kayak and VOILA!&nbsp; You can tow it with one&nbsp; hand!&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp; &nbsp; Im so clever :)  &nbsp;

      This past weekend I was in the Cape visiting family.  We had a lovely time.  On Sunday we decided to go for a Whale Watch in Provincetown.   Whales are cool, and we did manage to see a few (about 3-4).  One was a  urlLink Sei Whale  which decided to hang around and give us plenty of close looks.  (no picutures sorry).   We also saw the obligatory  urlLink humpback .  All that was very nice, and would have made for a successful whale watch.  But the REAL kicker of this one, was the sighting of a  urlLink Basking Shark .  These are actually pretty rare to see, and we got to check him out for a while.  Ours was also a rather large one (prolly 25 feet ).    My pics are ok.. not great.  But you'll get it :)    urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=4aa2nef.7t12042n&Uy=-ynj2al&Upost_signin=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3fshowSlide%3dtrue&Ux=0

      We went to Cape Cod this past weekend.  And on the road I passed many, many kayaks. But look at what some clever person has invented to solve his own kayak towing problems:  The Kayak Tow... Version 4.0     Now, you can't see it from this pic.  But that little bad boy is a home brew solution.  I noticed a couple wheels on an axle.  Then i noticed lots of what looked like egg crate material (like bedding) and an ample supply of duct tape.   Innnteresting.  His solution looks nicer, but I bet it was more work.
