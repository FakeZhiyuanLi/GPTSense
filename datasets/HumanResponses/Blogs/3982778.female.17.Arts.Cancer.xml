         Shs dips her body in the tub       like red velvet wrapped in frost       stringing the liquid down her skin       but all of it had cost              Each drip of blood a single tear       each pain in her heart a pain on there flesh       both from the people she had held dear       from them there blood caress              Glideding down her dark hair       streaming down her cheeks       as if she was crying again       her tears her only release              Curled in the cooling blood       soft as velvet on her skin       crying in her blood filled tub       it just isn't enough

          Yeah know when you lose a toy and you think it's invisible. When you lost something important and you've been looking for it for hours. I feel like that thing right now. I don't know if anyone is looking for me but that's how I feel at the moment.        No one ever really notices me, or just up and talks to me unless&nbsp;I give them a reason to. Most of the people I meet I have to work to meet, or they pity me.

          Well a while back I wasn't able to see Lee for a couple of weeks. While he was gone A guy at my school started woeing me. He wanted me to break up with Lee and be with him. He keep it on for a month driving me crazy. I keep thinking how Lee has to move even farther away how alone I will be. I hated myself for it. Dimbalora was trying his best to get me to leave with him. To go off and do wild things with him. It was a intesting offer. He sent me roses, and wrote poems to me. Then I saw Lee again and I broke down. I may have cared for Dimb but I love Lee. I stoped it, told Dimb he has no chance. So he doesn't talk to me much, escpecially since he's not in School anymore. I still hate myself for my betrayel and I admited to Lee I'm not strong, that I don't know how I would survive without him.           &nbsp;

          I feel I should start my story somewhere I'll start it with Candy. She was my bestfriend in the 7th grade. Yeah I know get over it but she is sorta major in my life. I talk to her, confided in her and cared for her like a sister and she left a knife in my back. She had barrowed thing's from me and not returned them and stole tuns of memories that were beautiful and now are rotted to the core.

          Today I can't stop thinking about my troubles. I look at myself and see a ugly, annoying, girl that has no future and no life. I look around myself and wonder why I have what little I do. I wonder why my boyfriend and my girfriend waste there time on me. I'm nobody, no one, nothing that's how it's always been.

          Well I'm worried. My love Lee is going through a lot, He has moved from his mothers to live with his father in another state. Everthing he knows is in Ohio and I worry for him since he has to figure out High School, College, friends, places to go, and figure out what to do and it doesn't help that his father has him constantly working for virtually no money. Also were going to be so far apart, I wish I could be with him always. I never want him to despare or be in any mental pain because of me.

          Hello this is my first entry so I'll introduce myself. I am Amber Rose Edwards and I live in Ohio but I currently am "vacationing" in Arizona. Right now I'm a McDonald's girl but I'm hoping to go into animation. But currently my real problem is I have to go back to Ohio to&nbsp;finish school but currently my family hates me there. My dad is a Alcoholic and he is also on anti-depressant medication. Well he abused his medication and tried to beat me up. I don't know why I didn't get bunches of brusises and scratches but I didn't. Although I got a minor concussion and probably whiplash considering how screwed up my neck is. I went to go see a chiropractor and I had severe damage on my neck.         Well anyway, back home they blame the incident on me. They think I'm a juvenile delinquent that yells and "carries on to much". A totally irresponsible girl that has wild sex parties and lies about everything.        So before I left I wasn't aloud to have any contact with anyone and considering my family was giving me no moral support I just about lost my mind. The only time I laughed was when I thought the situation I was in was ironic.

          I remember Verbrechen fondly and hate it with all my feart too. I thought when Endy and Lee had created this it would have brought us all closer, but it only pulled me farther apart. They didn't let me go off with them to do thing's, did let me join in the verbrechen ways. I was the girl they all held dear and didn't want any harm to come to. I hated it, I wanted to prove to them that I was worthy, that I was strong, but they didn't care that I wanted to be closer. I wanted to fight, I wanted to train, I wanted to work hard. I was never infjormed of anything, I wasn't anything to them. But I was there from the beginning, I just about started the whole thing. Of course I wasn't much of anything, it didn't matter that I started the table, that I started it all. That I introduced everyone and asked them to sit together, that I was the key link to the friendship. Then I was nothing. I have been tossed aside so many times I was used to it, but I thought they were different. I was wrong. I wish I was stronger, that they saw me as powerful, strong, wise, but no I was beautiful? they wanted to protect me, I hate it so. I didn't know anything till after everthing was broken up.

          I remember a long time ago I couldn't bare to hear about blood, I would imagine my blood being drained from me, my heart quickening from so little to pump, my body warming from the loss. I longed for the feeling. I realize now that's how I feel when Lee is with me. Like all my longings are fullfilled. Like he holds the key to my heart and is able to shut it down if he wants. I know now that I will be forever faithful because all my heart wants is him.

          I just don't know anymore, I'm confused and it seems I can't go anywhere. I'm out of options and my fate lays in others hands. Please don't crush me like everyone else has.

          Well I have made it so anyone can comment. I've been talking to Lee the past couple of days. I think everything is okay, I don't know though. I feel better now that I could call him. I had felt really sick till I was able to talk to him. I didn't eat much and the thought of doing anything gave me a headache. I miss him terriably and I wish I could go see Anita, she has a magical way of cheering me up. I might get to go see Kristal today, she'll be off of work at 7 and I hope when can hang out at her house.

          Wow no one comments on my blog. Anywho, recently Lee told me that back when we first started dating that he cheated on me with Cora. Cora said the same thing back then too. I choose to believe in Lee that nothing had happened. Also I had thought alot about it then, I didn't care. I knew Lee loved me, and I knew that he would either stay with me or let me go. I know he doesn't want to let me go but now he is questioning his faithfulness. I love him with all my heart and I believe he loves me with all of his too. I hope we stay together. What had happened was 10 months ago. I have grown with him, and I want to be with him. The thought of not hearing his jokes, having him hold me in his arms, us getting better at DDR, or him not kissing and touching me ever agains scares me. I love him dearly, more than the waking world. He sees me as someone important and not very many people see me that way, many have tossed me aside and not care for me. I know I depend on him alot, and I believe my trust has not been misplaced. Sure hie cheated on me 10 months ago. But nine of thoughs months he was with me, not cheating on me, and making me the happiest person alive.
