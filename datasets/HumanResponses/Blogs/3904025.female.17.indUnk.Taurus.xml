      this morning, i told hubBy that i wanna break up... bcoz the reason is tt i feel very stress... the 1st few mnths together with him, i think i was very happy bcoz he was supposed to make mi happy and nt let mi have burden... but since end of june start.. i start to feel tt the relationship is very shaky... i feel my burden adding on every single day.. til today i can't take it anymore... i told him my reasons and he wishes mi happy but i know he's nt... i think i am quite selfish to only think of my happiness.. i want to&nbsp;see his smile every single day or at least when i saw him... i told him in future when we are more stable we can be together again... i noe he's sad... he was crying on the way to school when i tok to him on the phone... but i wasn't there for him... loving someone is as painful as breaking up with someone.. really... i now in school waiting for friends... i hope i've nt regretted what i have done...   051287, if you happen to read this, just wanna let you know tt life can still go on without mi... there are better gals outside when you get into the workforce.. dun keep thinking abt mi... this painful decision i've made has made you suffer... i know... pls dun hate mi... we will be good friends no matter what... please stay by mi if i have troubles k? i'm sorry... take care... i really did love you very much before... dun cry anymore... study hard and take a diploma and get a better job... 030587 (>_
