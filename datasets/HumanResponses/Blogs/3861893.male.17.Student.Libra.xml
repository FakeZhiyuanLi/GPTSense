         Was raining cats and dogs in the morning. The stupid rain almost destroyed the entire day. Almost. But thank God that the rain stopped in time for me to go back to Fairfield.  By the time I reached Fairfield, it was already eleven plus. Collected my tickets from Amelia who kept asking me to buy tickets from her over the past few weeks. Didn't really want to buy, but bought anyway to prevent her from further irritating me. Haha.  Almost immediately after I collected my tickets from her, Yuan Hao came and bugged me. Kept asking me to buy his dumb chicken wings. I had just arrived and didn't even have time to walk around and here this guy is pestering me! Oh man! So I just entertained him and bought a couple of dumb chicken wings. I didn't even feel like eating them lor. Shih Hui, your brother is just as crap as you.  Had a nice chat with Li Rong and Sydney, my adopted mother. Niang! Haven't seen them for a long time. The last I saw them was probably one year ago on the same occasion. I' really unfilial. Sigh. Better repent before it's too late. Anyway, was glad that we still keep in touch with one another through one of the best invention of all - the device called handphone.   Also saw the people from Senggam. Haha. You must be wondering what's that. Haha. Was a name Kelvin thought of to call our soccer team. He says its the cantonese pronunication of the word sexy! Unbelievable! Ya, as usual they were at the primary school basketball court playing soccer. Just like the good old days. Some things just don't change, do they? Anyway, this bunch of people is one of my closest bunch of friends in Fairfield. Haha. Just loved those days. Those days when we just stay back after school to slack our lives away and still do well for exams. Those days when we spend more time in school than at home. Those days when we will just play carrom as though carrom was the world. Sigh. I miss those good old days.  Talked to Joel as well. Joel has certainly matured tremendously since those days when he talked nonsense, fought and argued with his fellow cadets over the slightest issue. Now, everytime I see him, he is more sensible. He's not that bad after all. Glad to see him doing well in Fairfield. This guy will surely be successful in life!  Yuen Mun! I still don't believe you told Daniel to lie to his parents to go to church. Yes, I know going to church is a good thing and is important. But, it doesn't make any sense if you lie to go to church. Lying in itself is bad enough. Lying to go to church is worse! But, I think I must agree with you that certain things are very conflicting and complicated. But, what can we do?  Saw Mr Wee. Haha. Glad that he still remembers and recognises me. Was talking to him with Daniel. The whole time he was there telling us to study hard, to work harder. Sigh. We all know that. Especially when your prelims are three weeks away. Thanks for the encouragement anyway.  And how can I forget this. I saw Elaine Lim. Yes, I saw Elaine Lim. At first, they all were telling me that Elaine Lim seemed to have aged a lot but I didn't really believed them. But when I saw her today, I really couldn't agree more. She's not even 40 and she looks like she's fifty. Must be the stress of leading a school like Fairfield. Besides that, she seems to have put on a whole ton of weight. She must have tried to de-stress by eating. And it didn't work.  In conclusion, today had been an eventful day. However, this means that I must work extra hard the next few days to make up for the time lost today.  NB: I didn't really want to write the last paragraph. It sounds so lame. But I decided to put what I've learnt in GP to good use. So, I have written a conclusion. Hopefully, this conclusion is up to HHH's standards.

      You probably wouldn't believe what I ate for lunch today. Haha. Went to Swensen's at JP for lunch with Raymond. Why? Haha. The reason is even more absurd. Because we couldn't find a table at the food court or the fastfood stores. Or rather, we were too lazy to look for an empty table in the multitude of Singaporeans. Yes, Singaporeans. Typical Singaporeans who are so damn bloody kiasu. So to Swensen's we went. Ate lunch and of course ice creams. What's Swensen's without ice-creams? Then, this Raymond was so full that he couldn't finish his ice cream. The whole time he was complaining about his stupid chocolate ice cream, complaining about the taste and everything else. Eight chocolate balls. Eight chocolate balls. Eight chocolate balls. Throughout the entire time he was eating the ice cream, he was chanting this. Haha. Damn lame.   In the end, the bill looked something like this:   Swensen's  1 Jurong West Central 2   1 Calamari Rings&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.00  1 Frost Ch. Malt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.90  1 Ice House&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.90  1 Salm Teriyaki&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.90  1 Grill Fish Samba&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13.90  Payment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;56.15    Haha. Paid over fifty bucks for lunch just because we didn't want to squeeze with Singaporeans in the food court. I mean, typical Singaporeans. After that, walked around JP aimlessly for about 2 hours. Haha. Should have spent that time doing some&nbsp;textual analysis or some normal distributions.   Talking about maths, suddenly remembered an interesting theory of Caleb. Caleb Huang. This guy suggested that when you divide the length of the first joint of your finger by the length of the second joint, you would get a constant. Haha. And this constant is about 1.5. Haha. What kind of lame shit is that? I mean, who in the world would bother about whether your finger joints will give you a constant. Surely we have things more important and interesting than that. Surely there is something more entertaining.   Talking about something more important. Prelims is exactly one month away. Yes, one month. Haha. Should be feeling a sense of urgency but here I am typing in front of the computer. Guess its my nature not to panic. Haha. So many things not done and yet so little time left. Studying is a torture. Yes, a torture. Sometimes, I just open the book but the information just refuses to sink in. Or rather, most of the time, I'm just sitting there with no work done. Sigh. How can this be? Just one month left...   Just one month left...   "Dost thou love life, then do not squander time, for that's the stuff life is made of." &nbsp;-Benjamin Franklin  "To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: a time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance; a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; a time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace." -Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

      Today is Thursday. Yes, Thursday. The supposedly shortest day of our timetable. But no. We were dragged down to some "interesting" econs tutorial which wasn't even supposed to be there in the first place. At the wrong hour of the day, the econs tutorial is surely a cure for insomnia. Definitely. I just wonder why the doctors don't recommend that to their patients.&nbsp;They will surely make more money. Anyway, before that tutorial, we&nbsp;made a pact that we wouldn't yield&nbsp;to temptation. Haha. So funny. Anyway, was glad that I didn't fall asleep like that Wesley who almost fell off his chair. Now, you must be thinking that if I didn't fall asleep, then I must be listening to the teacher attentively right? Wrong! I was not&nbsp;sleeping but was engaged in more entertaining activities. Almost throughout the entire session, I was talking with Alvina and Su Peng that nothing went in. The only part&nbsp;of my&nbsp;body&nbsp;that was productive was probably my right hand. I had to copy those long essay outlines. Haha. So&nbsp;much for productivity.   After that, I stopped&nbsp;at the bus stop at Queensway waiting for my bus. Guess who I saw? Soo Chin! Haha. Didn't really expect to see her at the bus stop. Almost didn't recognise her. In fact, she recognised me first. Haha. Then later saw her again when I was on the bus along Bukit Merah Safra. Haha.&nbsp;Was so funny. Anyway, knew her all the way back since those Sec One days. Haha.&nbsp;Couldn't remember how I&nbsp;really got to know her. Those days were donkey years ago. Haha. But one thing I remember&nbsp;was that she keeps playing this stupid game with me. Don't know how to describe the game lar. Yup, then went on to know her better during Sec Three and Four days even though wasn't in the same class as her. Ya, she's a nice person. Easy to get along. Haha.   Just received an email from Ying Yu about Mr Chia's wedding. Haha. Finally going to get married. Knew his guy all the way back in 1C'99. Was my form teacher. Have always been a slack teacher. Became Discipline Master but was still very slack. Haha. This guy implemented those discipline forms for people who don't do homework and yet during his classes, he never used those silly forms. Slacker! Haha. Glad to know that he is doing well and is going to get married. I wonder if this is the lady whom he courted for seven years or something. Haha. So devoted.   Think that's about all I will write today. Coz I'm rushing to watch my favourite show, the OC. Cool show. Yup. Got to go...

      Arghhh. Just did my maths tutorial and was so damn frustrated!!! Normal distribution, mean, standard deviation... A whole lot of trash... Who in the right frame of mind would want to know the probability that the computer can be repaired in 24 hours? Or how about this... Find the probability that an athlete would completed a random lap with mean 65 seconds.... How lame can the questions get? The questions made no sense at all.... Sigh. Maths is such a useless thing... Don't even how why I'm spending my precious time on this...  &nbsp;  Oh no... I totally forgot that there is Singapore Brainest Kid on TV today. Sigh. Wanted to watch it because the way those kids answer the question is very cute and funny. Sigh. Must wait for one more week before I can see the show again. Sigh. This is what happens when your brains get too much a dose of maths tutorial questions on some stupid distribution...  &nbsp;  I'm just glad that at least something went well. Argentina and Brazil are just ninety minutes away from facing each other, not counting extra time and penalties... And they are going to meet in the final... Haha... Hopefully nothing screws up and these two teams can meet each other. Haha. Should be exciting. Two powerhouses of South America, if not the world, are meeting each other!!! Hooray... Though both teams are not playing at their strongest, Brazil playing their third choice team and Argentina playing their second choice team, this match is surely a match not to be missed. Haha. Look forward to this match...  &nbsp;  Sigh. I'm so tired. The end is about to end. Then it will be Wednesday... A short day but very packed... Then there is econs lecture...Sigh. I hate econs lecture. Times seems to slow down whenever there is econs... Guess I will fall asleep during lecture again...  &nbsp;  Haha...Since we are at it, let me pose a maths question:  &nbsp;  What is the probability that KwokSiong will fall asleep in econs lecture on Wednesday given that he spends his Tuesday night typing this blog? Give your answer to the nearest whole number.  &nbsp;  Answer: 1&nbsp; &nbsp; Zzzzzzzzz.....

      Just reached home half an hour ago and here I am now sitting in front of the computer, typing this down. Today had been a long and eventful day. So let me pen my thoughts...  &nbsp;  School was dismissed at 12.50, and we only had a couple of lesson. Literally. We had an "exciting" GP lesson where the climax of the lesson was to do question analysis. Of all things!!! I hate this! Why do we keep doing things like these? First, it was textual analysis. Now, its question analysis. She seems to be enjoying to analysis of things. Sigh. Anyway, though the lesson was boring, nevertheless we tried to entertain ourselves during the group discussion. Talking about all kinds of things under the sun except question analysis. Then we had to fill up a stupid fish bone. Boring! Then they bully me again. Ask me to do the presentation because I'm the only guy around. Sigh.  &nbsp;  12.10 was the sacred moment. A group of&nbsp;about seven to eight of us left school together. The guard was sitting there, looking at us walk out before 12.50. What kind of a guard is he? The school&nbsp;hire&nbsp;him to prevent students from walking out before 12.50 and there he was looking at us walking out. What a&nbsp;useful guard we have. Anyway, why is it&nbsp;that&nbsp;almost all the guards that I see are all old&nbsp;men with their tummy sticking out? I don't think they can do anything to ensure the safety of the school lor.  &nbsp;  Went to&nbsp;Rapture, an annual dance concert presented by our school's dance society.&nbsp;I really admire the way they dance, each step with precision and accuracy. They&nbsp;must have trained really hard and long for this concert. Also, you can see the confidence that the dancers have&nbsp;when they dance. I really admire them. And&nbsp;they also invited guest dancers from the NUS and TJ. But the best part is&nbsp;still the teachers' dance. Who would have thought that Ms Carol Wong can dance so well?&nbsp;And this MeiSi was like, "did you&nbsp;see that??? So shocked"&nbsp;Ya... I didn't expect her be able to dance so well, the other teachers were great too. Haha. Mr Lam was also there, although he was quite "masked". Not many saw that it was him...  &nbsp;  Towards the end, there was the finale. And it was the best part. Within seconds, I saw Daniel the loser transformed into Daniel the champion as he did the most heroic act I have ever seen in my whole life. He did something that I would never have done even if you point a gun at my head. Something that I would never have done even if you give me a million bucks. Haha. It was an heroic act that lasted seconds but it sure printed a nice image of my new hero, Daniel. Haha. What did he do? Haha. I'm not going to say.  &nbsp;  Oh no, the week is coming to an end. And soon the words "6 more weeks" will be no more. And they are going to say "5 more weeks". Sigh. Five more weeks to prelims. Time flies.  &nbsp;  Sigh. Time to go to bed. Thank God I can sleep in late tommorrow coz I don't have to go to school for Bio lecture. Unlike some people.  &nbsp;  "Success doesn't come to you. You go to it."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Marva Collins  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Today was Yuen Mun's birthday. Happy Birthday!!! Anyway, I have known this guy all the way back since we were Sec One. Haha. I have seen this guy grow from the crappy guy he was in secondary school to the wise guy now. Was a little surprised this morning when you told me about the "second coming" and the Babylon. Actually, I haven't really thought about this thing. All I have is only some brief idea about what it is. Haha. Maybe I will go read up more about it when I'm free. Haha.  Also had Chemistry practical today. Was so long and difficult. Those experiments required so much reagents that the entire bench was very messy. Ended up some of my titration numbers are wrong. And didn't really bothered to alter the numbers. I just hate those times when there are so much things to do and yet so little time to complete. Had to really rush and so didn't really have time to organise the things properly. Sigh.  Had this interesting chat with Jane about the word "cute". Haha. I think I said that she was cute and she kept insisting that cute meant ugly but adorable. She said that I implied that she was ugly but adorable. Haha. Well, that wasn't what I meant. Haha. According to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, the word cute means "attractive or pretty especially in a dainty or delicate way". See, I wasn't saying anything bad about her. Haha. She also said that Aaron said the same thing about her. Haha. Great minds think alike.  Received back my GP essay and my economics examinations. Sigh. The results have dropped. I must really start pulling up my socks. Was really afraid that I would fail the economics examination after Mrs Lee said that very little people in the class passed the exam. She drew this stupid pie chart and showed us the percentage passes. Eventually, when we got back the papers, things didn't really turn out the way she said it was. The moment I got back the case study section, I was so happy. I passed case study. Though it was just a miserable 16 out of 30, I was quite glad because I knew that if I passed the case study section, I would pass the entire examination. Thank God I passed! Sometimes, I really think that teachers always like to exaggerate things to make students more worried and anxious. They always resort to tricks like this to make us nervous and panicky. Maybe they should try out other more effective methods.  6 more weeks to prelims. Must really start to work hard. And also must start believing that I will do well. Because there can be miracles when you believe.  When You Believe  (Whitney Houston & Mariah Carey)  Many nights we prayed With no proof anyone could hear In our hearts a hope for a song We barely understood  Now we are not afraid Although we know there’s much to fear We were moving mountains Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes  There can be miracles When you believe Though hope is frail It's hard to kill  Who knows what miracles You can achieve When you believe somehow you will You will when you believe  In this time of fear When prayer so often proves in vain Hope seems like the summer bird Too swiftly flown away  Yet now I'm standing here My heart’s so full, I can't explain Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say  There can be miracles When you believe Though hope is frail It's hard to kill  Who knows what miracles You can achieve  When you believe somehow you will You will when you believe  They don't know it's often when you ask, uh And it's easy to give in to your fear, uh  But when you’re blind you find your pain Can see or wake me through the rain? Boy, am I still resilient voice? Says love is the relief, oh   There can be miracles  When you believe Though hope is frail  It's hard to kill   Who knows what miracles You can achieve  When you believe somehow you will  Somehow you will You will when you believe  That's about all. I think its time to go to bed. Good Night.

      How in the world can Argentina lose one-nil to a loser team like Mexico? Argentina won their previous match six-nil with a hat-trick from Javier Saviola, and they could have crushed Mexico. Yes, all the goals were scored very late in the second half, but they were still expected to dominate against Mexico. Sigh.  By the way, did anyone tell them that the commentary sucks. The way that fellow talk is so anti-climax that an exciting match could turn out boring. Normally, in the dying minutes of the game, the atmosphere would become more tense and exciting. And yet, with somewhat stupid commentary, the exciting atmosphere doesn't seem to be there anymore. The commentary is a real spoiler. Sigh.  Sigh. Hope Argentina will meet Brazil along the way. Both teams are the champions of South America and it would definitely be a match to look out for. No doubt Brazil is playing their third team with relatively unknowns, but I'm sure Brazil will have their fair share of luck. They always have. Sigh. Brazil doesn't pay any attention to Copa. Winning the Copa is no big deal to them. They pay more attention to World Cup since its obviously more prestigious and more people watches. The whole world watches World Cup.  Sigh. The weekend is going to be over soon. Sigh. Monday again. And the whole week starts. 6 weeks to prelims. Sigh. Can't wait for the next weekend. Sigh. Must really start studying soon. Start taking out those books that have collected dust. Blow off the dust and start reading. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.

      I read of a reverend who stood to speak  at the funeral of his friend.  He referred to the date  on her tombstone  from the beginning... to the end.  He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the date with tears  but he said what mattered most of all  was the dash between those years.  For that dash represents all the time  that she spent alive on earth, and  now only those who loved her know  what that little line is worth.  For it matters not how much we own; the cars, the house, the cash.  What matters is how we live and loved and how we spend our dash.  So think about this long and hard, Are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left  You could be at "dash mid-range"   If we could just slow down enough  to consider what's true and real, and always try to understand  the way other people feel, and  be less quick to anger, show appreciation more and love the people in our life like we've never loved before.  If we treat each other with respect,  more often wear a smile  remembering that this special dash  might only last a little while.   So when your eulogy is being read with your life's actions to rehash... would you be pleased with the things they say about how you spent your dash?

      Yeah! This is it. A historic moment. The first entry to my blog. What a milestone!  Saw a couple of blogs lately and developed this sudden urge to create a blog where I can express myself freely. Haha. I'm kinda new in this area, and could do with some expert advice. If you have any precious advice, please don’t hesitate to contact me.  Well, what shall I say? Guess I should start with a little introduction about myself. Kwok Siong is my name. Some people call me by my initials KS, while others call me Siew. Closer people also know me by Mungyo. Many people have asked me what does the word Mungyo mean and what kinda word is that. Basically, all I have to say is this: I don't know the meaning of this word! Saw this word somewhere and thought that it was a nice word. So, I took the word and started using it ever since. I don’t know what it means, but who cares anyway.    What are my interests? Actually I enjoy watching soccer. Haha. Who doesn't? Many think that soccer is a stupid game with twenty two people chasing after one stupid ball. But actually I think if you really sit down and watch, you would enjoy watching soccer. Since we are at it, let me give you my two cents worth on soccer. This is my world XI, following a 4-4-2 formation.   Goalkeeper: Gianluigi Buffon (he's the best in the world)  Left Back: Roberto Carlos (he's a defender but also adds strength to the attack)  Right Back: Lilian Thuram (need I say more?)  Centre Defender: Alessandro Nesta (I love him!)  Centre Defender: Marcel Desailly (they called him the rock)  Left Midfield: Pavel Nedved (he's the champion)  Right Midfield: Robert Pires (provided he doesn't go around diving)  Centre Midfield: Zinedine Zidane (legendary footballer)  Centre Midfield: Patrick Vieira (he's got the determination)  Centre Forward: Ronaldo (fat but fast)  Centre Forward: David Trezeguet (you may dispute this, but he's still good)  And the manager who's worthy to lead this team is none other than Fabio Capello. He is the only person in the entire world who is worthy to lead this team. He is a master strategist and knows how to change the game. Just look at how he changed Roma from a team of losers to title challengers.  Okay, that's about all now. Bye.

      Let me begin today's entry with a picture.     Well, everybody knows that England forward Michael Owen has left Liverpool FC to join Real Madrid CF. Why does this mean? Allow me to give my two cents' worth.  Firstly, Real Madrid has developed this habit of buying star players to strengthen their squad. This sounds pretty true as teams usually like to strengthen their squad, right? Wrong! The truth is that Real Madrid buy players from teams which threatens their role as the king of European football. Here is my evidence:  Real bought Figo from Barcelona because Barcelona was considered a threat to them.  Real bought Zidane from Juventus because Juventus was considered a threat to them.  Real bought Ronaldo from Inter because Inter was considered a threat to them.  Real bought Beckham from Manchester United because Manchester United was considered a threat to them.  And, allow me to say this even though some may disagree with me, Real bought Owen from Liverpool because Liverpool was considered a threat to them.  Beware, Liverpool has awakened!  Secondly, I must say that this shows that players at Liverpool are not that bad after all. Owen is the second player to leave for Real Madrid in ten years. First it was Steve McManaman. Then now Owen. Which other clubs in the world can boast that it has two world class players leaving for Real Madrid? Let alone in a ten year period? Barcelona can almost claim that feat except that Zidane's move to Real was not direct. And what about Manchester United? Beckham was their only export. With all this, I rest my case.  Finally, allow me to end with the words of former Liverpool manager and Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish, "Liverpool had such a marvellous group of players. It was no surprise the trophies kept coming."

      Today is Friday and it must have be a usual Friday. But wait. Today is also the 13th. Yes, today is Friday the 13th. So I decided that maybe I should do a little research about the mystery behind Friday the 13th.  The following is taken from  urlLink Why Friday the 13th is Unlucky?”   By David Emery   Paraskevidekatriaphobia: Fear of Friday the 13th I have before me the abstract of a study published in the British Medical Journal in 1993 entitled "Is Friday the 13th Bad for Your Health?"  With the aim of mapping "the relation between health, behaviour, and superstition surrounding Friday 13th in the United Kingdom," its authors compared the ratio of traffic volume to vehicular accidents on two different days, Friday the 6th and Friday the 13th, over a period of years.   Interestingly, they found that in the region sampled, while consistently fewer people chose to drive on Friday the 13th, the number of hospital admissions due to accidents was significantly higher than on "normal" Fridays.   Their conclusion: "Friday 13th is unlucky for some. The risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent. Staying at home is recommended."   Paraskevidekatriaphobics - people afflicted with a morbid, irrational fear of Friday the 13th — are no doubt pricking up their ears just now, buoyed by evidence that their terror may not be so irrational after all. But it's unwise to take solace in a single scientific study (the only one of its kind, so far as I know), especially one so peculiar. I suspect it has more to teach us about human psychology than it does about any particular date on the calendar.   The Most Widespread Superstition  The sixth day of the week and the number 13 both have foreboding reputations said to date from ancient times; their inevitable conjunction from one to three times a year portends more misfortune than some credulous minds can bear. Folklorists say it's probably the most widespread superstition in the United States — some people won't go to work on Friday the 13th; some won't eat in restaurants; many wouldn't think of setting a wedding on the date.   How many Americans at the turn of the millennium still suffer from this condition? According to Dr. Donald Dossey, a psychotherapist specializing in the treatment of phobias and coiner of the term "paraskevidekatriaphobia," the figure may be as high as 21 million. If he's right, eight percent of Americans are still in the grips of an old superstition.   Exactly how old is difficult to say, because determining the origins of superstitions is an imprecise science, at best. In fact, it's mostly guesswork.   If you have 13 letters in your name, you will bad luck (Jack the Ripper, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Theodore Bundy and Albert De Salvo all have 13 letters in their names). There are 13 witches in a coven.    [A Digression: Oh no! The name SIEW KWOK SIONG has 13 letters!!!]  As if to prove the point, the Bible tells us there were exactly 13 present at the Last Supper. One of the dinner guests — er, disciples — betrayed Jesus Christ, setting the stage for the Crucifixion.   Did I mention the Crucifixion took place on a Friday?    The Unluckiest Day of All  The astute reader will have noted that while we have thus far insinuated any number of possible connections between events, practices and beliefs attributed to ancient cultures and the superstitious fear of Fridays and the number 13, we have yet to explain how, why or when these separate strands of folklore converged — if that is indeed what happened — to mark Friday the 13th as the unluckiest day of all.   There's a very simple reason for that: nobody knows.   A Thoroughly Modern Phenomenon?   There are drawbacks to the "day so infamous" thesis, not the least of which is that it attributes great cultural significance to a relatively obscure historical event. Even more problematic, for this or any other theory positing premodern origins for Friday the 13th superstitions, is the fact that no one has been able to document the existence of such beliefs prior to the 19th century. If people who lived before the late 1800s perceived Friday the 13th as a day of special misfortune, no evidence has been found to prove it. Some scholars suspect the stigma is a thoroughly modern phenomenon exacerbated by 20th-century media hype.   Friday the 13th doesn't even merit a mention in E. Cobham Brewer's voluminous 1898 edition of the "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable," though one does find entries for "Friday, an Unlucky Day" and "Thirteen Unlucky."  When the date of ill fate finally does make an appearance in later editions of the text, it is without extravagant claims as to the superstition's historicity or longevity. The very brevity of the entry is instructive — "A particularly unlucky Friday. See Thirteen" — implying that the extra dollop of misfortune attributed to Friday the 13th can be accounted for in terms of an accrual, so to speak, of bad omens: Unlucky Friday + Unlucky 13 = Unluckier Friday.   If that's the case, we're guilty of a misnomer for labeling Friday the 13th "the unluckiest day of all," a characterization perhaps better reserved for, say, a Friday the 13th on which one breaks a mirror, walks under a ladder and spies a black cat crossing one's path — a day, if there ever was one, best spent in the safety of one's own home with doors locked, shutters closed and fingers crossed.

      Then Job replied:   "Indeed, I know that this is true.  But how can a mortal be righteous before God?   Though one wished to dispute with him,  he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.   His wisdom is profound, his power is vast.  Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?   He moves mountains without their knowing it  and overturns them in his anger.   He shakes the earth from its place  and makes its pillars tremble.   He speaks to the sun and it does not shine;  he seals off the light of the stars.   He alone stretches out the heavens  and treads on the waves of the sea.   He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion,  the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.   He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed,  miracles that cannot be counted. "  Job 9:1-10

      Congratulations to Manchester United for losing the Charity Shield. No, I'm not trying to be sarcastic or lame. If you watch soccer regularly, you would probably have realized that the winner of the Charity Shield will never win the Premiership. That means Arsenal will not win the Premiership this season. I repeat, Arsenal will not win the Premiership. If you think that I'm talking nonsense, here is the proof:  In 01/02, Man Utd played Liverpool in the Charity Shield. Liverpool won. But, Man Utd won the Premiership.  In 02/03, Arsenal played Liverpool in the Charity Shield. Arsenal won. But, Man Utd won the Premiership.  In 03/04, Man Utd played Arsenal in the Charity Shield. Man Utd won. But, Arsenal won the Premiership.  In 04/05, Man Utd played Arsenal in the Charity Shield. Arsenal won. And you know the rest.  Need I say more?  Anyway, today is National Day. Here's a cake for Singapore.      Don't know why but the song "Home" keeps popping up.  Whenever I am feeling low I look around me and I know There's a place that will stay within me Wherever I may choose to go I will always recall the city Know every street and shore Sail down the river which brings us life Winding through my Singapore  This is home truly, where I know I must be Where my dreams wait for me, where that river always flows This is home surely, as my senses tell me This is where I won't be alone, for this is where I know it's home  When there are troubles to go through We'll find a way to start anew There is comfort in the knowledge That home's about its people too So we'll build our dreams together Just like we've done before Just like the river which brings us life There'll always be Singapore  Btw, watched Singapore Idol just now. The host was Gurmit. Was so funny. Some people just don't mind embarrassing themselves on national television. Haha. There was this guy who sang the song Lemon Tree. The way he sang the song, it was clearly evident that he was trying to be Singapore's version of William Hung. And mind you, when I say this, it is with all due respect to William Hung. He was so action-packed, swinging his hands... Nah, its just another failed attempt.  Then, there was this guy who sang some dumb song so softly that the judges couldn't even hear. When he finished the song, he asked the judges for comments. Dick Lee had this very amusing statement to say, "How can we give you comments when we can't even hear you sing?" Haha. Boy, this guy was damn persistent that he continued to sing even when the judges told him to buzz off. Was so entertaining.  There was another guy who kept asking the judges for permission to do the slightest thing. "May I have the permission to..." "May I have the permission to..." Was even more interesting when one of the judges told him, "You have all the permission in the world..." Haha. But, I think the best part was when the judges gave their comments. Ken made a tongue-in-cheek remark, "May I have the permission to say that your singing is horrible?" Was damn funny...  I guess this is the best part of Singapore Idol. The entertaining part is always when there are a lot of lousy singers who want to have their faces on national television. After that, it wouldn't really be entertaining as there isn't really anything to laugh at. Nonetheless, its nice entertainment. Rock on!

      Today is Sunday. Went to church as usual. I was so surprised when the moment I entered the ballroom, everyone was dressed in our national colours. Red top with white bottoms with the occasional white top with red bottoms. Haha. The entire scene was so amusing. It was as though all of us were attending church with a designated uniform. Haha.  And indeed it was interesting to see the church leaders wearing some different, instead of their usual shirt and tie. Haha. Uncle Tiong Howe was in a red shirt and a pair of beige trousers. Haha. That was the first time I see him wearing something different. Usually, it was a blue shirt and a flowered tie. Haha. Then, there is Uncle Thomas. Haha. He wore a red Liverpool jersey. Haha. You'll never walk alone!  After worship, Uncle Tiong Howe led the entire church in a prayer of the nation. The prayer was powerful. I repeat, the prayer was powerful. It was the most powerful prayer I think I ever heard from Uncle Tiong Howe. I've known him for seven years now, and this is possibly one of the best prayers by him. Praise God.  Then, we sang this wonderful song by Hillsongs. Its called "All the Heavens"  Holy holy are You Lord The whole earth is filled with Your glory Let the nations rise to give Honour and praise to Your name Let Your face shine on us And the world will know You live All the heavens shout Your praise Beautiful is our God The universe will sing Hallelujah to You our King  This song really inspired me. It reminds me that I have a wonderful God. Another song that I really love is "To the Ends of the Earth". Its also by Hillsongs.  Love unfailing Overtaking my heart You take me in Finding peace again Fear is lost in all You are  And I would give the world to tell Your story Cause I know that You've called me I know that You've called me I've lost myself for good within Your promise I won't hide it I won't hide it  Jesus, I believe in You And I would go to the ends of the earth To the ends of the earth For You alone are the Son of God And all the world will see That You are God You are God  These two songs really inspired me. I really hope that this songs will impact you just as just as they impacted me.  Btw, I just remembered the significance of 8 August. Haha. Its something quite silly, but I still hold things like this close to my heart. You can say whatever you want, but its still quite significant to me. Haha.  Two years ago, on this very day, I went out on my first date with her. Haha. Has been two years now but it still seemed like it was only yesterday. Haha. I can still remember vividly what happened that day. During that week, I have tried asking her out for lunch, but each time she told me that she was busy. No, she wasn't lying. She was really busy. A few days later, she passed me this little note, which I still have it now.  In that little note, she said sorry for not being able to make it everytime I asked her out. So, she suggested that we could go out on 8 August, after our national day celebration. Haha. Upon seeing that note, I was so happy. I immediately called her and ask if she was interested in catching a movie as well. Throughout the entire conversation, I felt so nervous. I was so afraid that she would say no. But, thankfully, she agreed. Haha. I was so happy when she agreed. No words could ever describe how I felt at that moment.  So, we went for our first date. Went to town, went to almost every shopping mall. From Lido to Heeren to Plaza Sing. Haha. Haha. That was the happiest day in my life.

      "I want to thank everyone who made this event a success," the teacher went. If the aim of the committee was to make everyone stone their life away, then surely that was successful. If not, it would be a failure. And, as it turns out, it was a failure. A total failure. Had Tharman been there, he would have died of shame. It was so shameful.  I didn't even know what I was doing there in the first place. All I know is that the only reason why I went to school today was to hand up some dumb econs essay. I should have handed them up yesterday. Me and my big mouth. I told my dear "stressed" econs rep that I will hand in today. Sigh. Should have followed her advice and completed them yesterday. Had I done so, I would not have undergone those torturing hours in the "sports complex", watching some dumb people playing some dumb musical chairs. Damn dumb.  Went for lunch after that dumb thing ended. Lunch was okay, ate a couple of pieces of sinfully oily chicken. Haha. I'm gonna become fat. Who cares? Went down to Bugis where I walked aimlessly around that complex, not knowing what to buy. I wanted to come down here to buy some stuff, but just didn't know what to buy. Nah, I'm not trying to imitate Caleb who spends half his life buying stuff in town. I seriously needed to buy. Kerjin was there with me, walking aimlessly as well. Haha. Enjoyed the chat with her about some "classification". And then, there was this unspoken consensus thing. What twelve o'clock. . Oh yar, there is still this "I love pigs" thing. Haha. Damn funny Sometimes, chats like this can help relieve stress. I seriously need to relieve some stress after some "interesting" national day celebration.  Reached home about 4 plus. Slacked all the way till dinner. Didn't really feel like doing anything. Who cares whether prelims is in 16 days? Shit, the days are really numbered. 16, 15, 14, 13,.....Time is running out....  Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them.  ~Dion Boucicault  The Present is a Point just passed.  ~David Russell  Time is an equal opportunity employer.  Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day.  Rich people can't buy more hours.  Scientists can't invent new minutes.  And you can't save time to spend it on another day.  Even so, time is amazingly fair and forgiving.  No matter how much time you've wasted in the past, you still have an entire tomorrow.  ~Denis Waitely
