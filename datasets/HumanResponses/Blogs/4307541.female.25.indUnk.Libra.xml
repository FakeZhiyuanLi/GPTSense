      It has been a month since that very day he walked out of my life. That day when my heart was broken into pieces.  He ended the relationship while chatting on Yahoo Messenger with me. I was at Canada then. No, i didnt expect this to happen. Too soon. I never thought a relationship could be this fragile. I wanted us to keep trying. I suggested, let's start meeting up when i got back from Canada. I asked him to sort out his thoughts, and then let's just try again once more.  I asked him,  "So, are we still trying or are we already over?"     He answered,  "It's over."     He claimed,  "I've lost all my feelings for you."     We were together for 63 days, started from 22 May 2004 to 26 July 2004. I wish, we could try it once more. Committed. Put in our hearts to do it. But he choosen to give up. Perhaps he thought we werent worth trying.  He said,  "We're too alike so we wont be happy but it's still nice to know there's a someone out there who is so smiliar but of different sex."   It was love to me. And, it's still love.

      I wanted desperately to ask him, "How have you been?"  I wanted to know about him.  I've missed the connection.   "Does he has a new person in his life now?"   "Does he has a new person who occupied his heart now??   "How has life been treating him?"   "Is he happier now?"   I bet, he has already forgotten me. I bet, he has already erased me from his Yahoo Messenger and ICQ listing. I'm now a history. I'm a past. A past is meant to be forgotten.  I still see him online. Friends suggested i should have him erase from my list too. That would definitely speed up my process in forgetting him.  It's painful. And, I couldnt bear to do it.  I'm silly. He can laugh at my foolishness. I dont give it a damn.  When we've just broken up. That was the worst period. Whenever I closed my eyes then, I used to see him crushing my heart with both of his hands. I could see blood oozing out. I tried to stop him but couldnt. I felt the pain. It was painful.  And now, he's gone.  Left me and a longing heart.

      I'm feeling a little out of it and melancholy nite.  I love to rekindle a connection we used to share, to get to know you abit better but on a different level. Having you as a friend would be nice. Our encounter has happened for a reason. I refused to let it distinguishes. I enjoyed what we had before and still feeling a connection now.  I tried too hard. This was what you used to tell me. I really value the possibility of rekindling some of the times we had. But the prospect of that makes me both sad and scared to try.  The best thing i can do is just plunge in as i normally do and see what happens. I understand reintroduction will be difficult but i'm going to give it a shot. I feel like I look a weiner approaching things in such a manner. I still feel that connection but do not know what to do about it. Somehow, that step will happens if destined.  I feel like its something i need to do. I hope i can do it and not make a fool of myself.  I guess time will tell.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed, hoping for a miracle to bring things right once more. You were right about I couldnt stand silence. Other than silence, i couldnt stand unsettled and unresolved issue.  Somehow, i know you wouldnt want any communication at this very moment. I couldnt figure out the reason. Those guy friends were telling me it's always the men's thing for not wanting any possible track of a past relationship to remember. Perhaps. I tried to understand. I couldnt see it.  I'm sorry.  I've never once believe in miracle but ironically i'm desperately hoping for one, now.  I like how we can be friends. I like the fact we're laughing and be happy about everything.  It's nice.  A miracle. I want it.  Everything was a dream when i had you.

      I'm feeling such a mixture of conflicting emotions tonight, none of them really particularly good - all amounting to a certain overwhelming sense of frustration.  Lester called. Told him that i've decided.  He asked,  "are you sure thats what you want?"     I said,  "I just need a break. To get away. To think." well, it's definitely not an easy decision but i think it'll do me good. I felt, suffocating here. Kinda stressed. Kinda lost."   Lester is coming to my office on Thursday to interview his Sales Engineer.  urlLink   Other than Lester, others friends dont seem to understand my intention of leaving here.  They thought im trying to escape. Am i? I suppose, i'm just lost. urlLink    The most annoying is the acceptance factor. I mean accepting how i feel.

       urlLink    See life as it is. I'm just me. A simple gal with a big heart thats filled with love. It's for her man. The right man that comes along in her life. She wants love. A someone to wrap her in his arms. A someone who knows how to respect, to cherish, to understand and love her for just who she is. She's waiting for a love that tests time itself. A fairytale.

      I'm leaving for England very soon, gonna be a student once more.   urlLink http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/research/phd/PhDBioinformatics2004col.pdf   I wish, i would get to see him one last time before i leave.  I've missed London. Nice weather. Like those of Brisbane winter days. The weather is usually perfect during the week by rains and is cold on weekend.  I always love the coldness.  The first SMS he sent me was..  "beautiful gloomy day! our kind of weather"  sent on  24 May 2004  at  08:25:39.   It was the weather, and england that got us talking then.  I SMSed him, i wrote  "I suppose it all could have ended up differently but it didnt. If we ever have yet another chance, things would be different. I suppose it wont happens."     It followed by  "I wonder, would we ever get to talk again? I've left the silence as it is. I might be leaving for England soon. Let's talk again before i leave, okay? answer me."   As usual, i didnt receive any reply from him.  Dishearted.   My whole life is like a cardboard.    A Rollercoaster life it's bound to fall.    Up and down and in and out again where we're living in.    Sweet kiss take me to the moon tonight.    Take a good look at what I left behind In this place of love and suitcase of night and my broken pride.    So I'm saying goodbye Cause London Bridge is falling down, falling down.    And it's alright for me, alright for me.    London Bridge is falling down, falling down.    It's alright for me, alright for me.    Tell me what you want, tell me I'm right.    But don't go sneaking out in the middle of a night.    I want to cradle the sun to to warm this heart of mine.    But I won't compromise.    So I'm saying goodbye Cause London Bridge is falling down, falling down.    And it's alright for me, alright me.    London Bridge is falling down, falling down.    It's alright for me, alright for me I don't want to know.    I just want to go away from here away    A sudden urge of crying.

      What did anything matter when it was all going to end in death anyway?  The futility of life when you know that everything and everyone you love will eventually die. The focus changes, but the message is always the same.  "What's the point? Who cares? Why do anything? Nothing matters."   It's an overwhelming of emptiness, of meaninglessness.

        urlLink   Uncommon Sense  written by  Dr Mel Gill , supposedly a handbook of life you wish you had when you were born.  Had an ecounter with him over at Excelsior Hotel at a workshop in last November.  He talked about love.   He said, "if its coming from outside in, then its a gift and if this gift is going to leave one day, then just let it goes but be thankful."   In his book, he talked about one simple principle in life. Nothing on this planet lasts forever. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. When we realise this then we will understand that everything and everyone that comes our way is a gift, a soul-working tool, a joy to have for the moment that we've it. If we treat the people in our life as gift given to us by life then we would start to give thanks for their presence in our life, even if its only for a short while.  And, to think of ourself as a gift to other people's lives as well. like all things, and all relationships, letting go is part of the growth process. It leads to emotional maturity, spiritual maturity and ultimately wisdom.  Letting go is painful.  My heart is still undergoing the healing process.

      What day is it?  I've been making changes - physical, mental and emotional .. always, there's more. An adventure of another day. Today's obligation. Anticipation for the future.  The world feels hopeful.  I feel alive.  Met up with GS in late evening, for dinner.  Somehow, it just like old times, just 2 old friends catching up with eachother from what we missed over the years.  All of sudden, he asked me,  "what if i fall in love with you one day? i mean, i really fall in love with you one day, what will happen? will we be together?"      I didnt answer.   He's always like an elder brother.  No one knows about tomorrow.  Afterwards, i began thinking about other people. other relationship and friendship that ended due to misunderstandings and immaturity.  I thought of Benny. have i gotten over him yet?  I believe very much in self-love. Liking yourself. If you go through life trying to please someone else, trying to make them happy then you're not really living. Sometimes, running away is good - but only if you're running away to find yourself.. not running away form something else.  What do we live for? If not to follow our own paths, our own desire? It doesnt mean we've to step on people along the way, but we also dont have to live their lives either. When you know better, you do better.  I remember, GS told me earlier.. " it's your personality thats your most noticeable trait and it's your determination, drive and tenacity that define you."   These elements lend me the self-confidence that most men find intimidating. I'm intensely passionate, opinionated but rather fragile deep down, easily wounded.  My passion permeates every aspect of my view that  'life is for living' .  I'm a truly simple person.  Somehow, i miss Benny.
