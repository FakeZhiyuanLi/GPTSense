						    urlLink     Ready for graduation from college! Ryan's 21 here and ready to get his 2 degrees after 4 years at The College Of Charleston in Charleston South Carolina. BS Mathematics and BA in Chemistry Magna Cum Laude. Smart kid. He's now at The University of Indiana Bloomington. He's a 2nd year graduate student earning his PhD in Theoretical Quantitative Chemistry.   urlLink He's on the web here...nice beard!    urlLink and here...

						    urlLink     Pat is 18 here (20 now). He is working his fist job making burritos at Free Bird World Burritos in Austin Texas. The food service bug bit him and he's now managing a kitchen at a different restaurant in Austin called "Pato's".  He's a great leader and a very good cook.

						    urlLink     Ryan Fenno at a really old Mac...sorry about the pic, it's a low rez scan from an old snapshot.  Ryan is I believe in the 5th grade here so that would make him 8 years old here. He was born in November so he was always the youngest kid in class. He started Kindergarten at age 4.   We were living in Oceanside California at this time. That's another story though.  And Pat...   urlLink

						   My posts sound like one of those bad text books we had back in high school in the 70's. Fluff and no substance.  Hey I'll work on it.  In the meantime here pictures of some drums. My DW kit in the great room. The room isn't really that great but it is what society tells me to call it.  Man this is a huge picture. I figured at age 46 with my two sons grown up and less expenses, I should treat myself to some of the best drums made. Over the past 30+ years I have played just about every brand drum out there. This set is my dream kit form about 20 years ago.  DW is a relatively small corporation located in Oxnard California USA, very close to Los Angeles. They have been making drums for over 20 years. One drum at a time. The hands on building process has created some of the finest drums made with an emphasis on the "modern drum sound". Of course with a little tuning they can be made to have the "not so modern drum sound".  The kit is all maple with an outer ply of curley maple. Highly figured with lots of visible grain. The finish on the drums is called "Light Tobacco to Candy Black Burst". They call this wood/finish combination "exotic - with custom lacquer finish" and indeed the serial numbers all begin with "E", identifying them as such and differentiating them from the "regular" DW drums.  Not only do they look beautiful, they sound beautiful as well.

						   Parenting and Teaching  I'm no expert at parenting but I am what I would call a para(nt)professional. I have 2 grown sons, Ryan and Pat. Both are great, bright intelligent kids. Going in two vastly different directions. I learned early on how different they were. And how different all kids are from one another. My eldest son Ryan who is now 22 years old is a second year graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington. He finished 2 undergrad degrees in 4 years at the college of Charleston in Charleston South Carolina. One degree is in Mathematics and one is in Chemistry. His focus now at grad school is theoretical quantum chemistry. He is also the sweetest kid you would want to know. Firm in his convictions and a little left leaning but very caring. Sense of humor is tremendous. He has always been a high achiever, eager to please but able to show both outer and inner strength when needed. Nobody's fool and complete with common sense beyond his years. Pat is the other side of the coin. Just as bright as Ryan but unwilling or unable to apply this to what I would consider the acedemic mainstream. He finished high school then went out wandering. Looking for something that I am not sure he even knows. I know he will find his way as he proves to me at every turn. Also nobody's fool, he nonetheless does some foolish things. He reminds me so much of myself that it continually scares me. Not the fright that you would feel say at a horror flick. More like the fear you feel when you see someone you love about to be hurt by something you have no control over. He's now managing the kitchen at a Mexican restaurant here in Austin and seems suited for this. He's able to lead and let people know what needs to be done and when. He is a great manager.  So through the years they were growing up I learned plenty. I learned how important it is to have both parents in the house. My wife Carol and I never played good cop bad cop. We interchanged the rolls as needed and did the best we could. The results speak literally for themselves.  Now as a teacher of drumming I encounter all types of kids coming to me to learn. Some are talented and don't work at it, others have not one lick of ability but work and work to get things right. The assignments I give to my beginning students are not difficult. Unless of course you are an uncoordinated 12 year old the desperately wants to learn to play drums. Drums more than any other is a paradoxical musical instrument. Both primitive and ultra modern at the same time. Requiring a very high degree of concentration, coordination and practice.

						   In music the phrase "Letter A" is the place where a tune or melody really begins. So it is with my story. I will be posting here as often as possible, which currently is the middle of most days and sometimes the middle of the night. I plan to make entries that are both personal and candid. I won't hold back. Here I'll express my feelings freely and succinctly in hopes that someone, somewhere will both enjoy and learn from the many musical and not so musical experiences I have enjoyed over the years.  Some Background  People take up musical instruments for many different reasons. Some for recreation, socializing, creative outlet and some even do it to make money. I must admit I took up the drums for none of these noble reasons. Looking back it was mainly to meet girls. My father was a drummer, musical arranger and composer who after fathering 5 children had the unpleasant experince of suffering a massive heart attack at age 40. We lost dad when I was just 8 years old. The ramifications of his death, the ripple effect, continues to move outward even after all these years. One effect was that I by default inherited his drums. Not his talent, or at least not as much talent as he had. I pretty much was a banger on these drums through my school years. Jamming with other girl seeking guys and mostly just having fun with it. It wasn't until well after school and a few years in the Navy that I actually began studying the instruments, its many demands and its many shortfalls.  I will most likely bounce around the timeline of my life on these posts. Some things are so clear in my mind it was as if they happened yesterday. Some are a bit cloudy and tend to ooze out of me when I least expect it. When that happens and I am at the computer I will cruise over and post.  So enjoy the ride and be sure of one thing. If I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't.

						    urlLink    Pat's girlfriend Blakely had a nasty spill on her bike while riding to the Lance Armstrong parade a couple days ago. Lots of road rash. Here Pat's keeping an eye on her while her medications are the only thing keeping her cheery. Glad she made it through the wreck with no serious injuries.

						   All the guys in the Instagators band know I am taking a powder and moving on to other things. No bad feelings. I guess they will find their way as I have to find mine. The gig at Mulligan's with them went fine and dandy. The place is a giant pool hall with lots of carpeting and lots of pool tables so the sound in the room is really nice. Easy to fill with the PA and very forgiving. Volume can easily be controlled there. Lots of nice folks there but as all Instagator gigs, pay is crap.  Rock n Roll people!

						   Another week passes into history. Lots happening in the world...Iraq being at the forefront, the Congo (thanks Belgium), The Sudan (thanks Christiana Alampur from CNN for her as usual stellar reporting - why was she taken out of Iraq? - she seemed the best reporter on the ground of the whole lot). Just so much happening and us Americans, essentially insulated from all the tumult (with the exception of the occasional bombing of our large buildings) happily going on with our lives. So much that it is unwise in my opinion to focus on too much negativity. Be aware of what is happening, do what you can do to make life better for friends and family and those we come in contact with daily. Think globally, act locally as they say.  The election rhetoric is wratcheting up. The Republicans are so negative compared to the democrats in their advertising and campaign commercials. I think this is creating a negative backlash and that in the long run will hurt them. I never relized the country could be so polarized. Most polls are showing Kerry ahead in the battle ground states. Pretty impressive when you consider that a sitting president during wartime has never lost a general election in the short history of our country. Bush could very well be the first.  The watershed for one side or the other will be the debates. In my humble opinion I believe Kerry will make Bush take the offensive and speak off the top of his head. Nothing can hurt Bush more. When he's not scripted he fails miserably. We shall see.  I called in sick last night to work so I cold play a gig with Casey Just. His CD is just about ready to go to print. The art cover, pics, liner notes look great. And the music is great as well...if you dig psychofunkabilly. Nice. I'm proud of this work.  Anyway, back to work tonight for one shift. Then 2 gigs this weekend with the Instagators. This is the near swan song with them as I have decided to drop this band so that I can spend more time with the Original Recipe Band (my brother Richard and my project). There are certain drawbacks to running your own band but the positives surely outweigh the negatives. So after quitting the Instagators I have the following bands:  Original Recipe (8 pce  band, 4 horns, 4 rhythm, lots of singers - variety band with 300+ tunes in the book)  Casey Just  urlLink www.caseyjust.com (Psychofunkabilly previously discussed)   Code Blue  urlLink www.codeblueband.com (classic rock 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, girl singer)   Corky Robinson (dance band playing mostly for the blue hairs -old folks - I sing lots of Sinatra tunes in this band)  And another project I may pick up...The Wendy Daniels Band    urlLink www.wendydaniels.com   Plus teaching Fridays now. Four students with more on the way.   Now I have something to look at in case I forget what the heck I am supposed to be doing.   Thanks blogger for the bandwidth.  JF

						   Friday I was off (the first Friday off in 9 weeks) and I thought that would prepare me for the rest of the wekend. No dice. Stayed up late playing poker (won 38 bucks) with friends and the quality of sleep was disturbed by dreams of drawing to an iside straight, betting too much and losing. Well I dodn't lose my shirt. I feel I'm getting better at the game as now I have to call people looking for a game instead of them calling me.  Saturday was The Instigators out on Lake Travis at Cabo Loco. This was one of those dates where I played in the same club two days in a row with 2 different bands. Rock at night and then Jazz for the Sunday brunch. Saturday was lighter than usual crowd wise. Dino Lee (if you know Austin you know Dino) showed up to check out the band. I also met  urlLink Wendy Daniels.   She is also looking for a drummer. Seems everyone is. We'll get together for dinner some night soon and discuss the band. Sorry guys, she's married to the guitar player/band director.  Rehersal with my brother and the new bass player went very well. I think we found a winner for the bass chair. Mor eon that later.  Busy weekend.

						   I'm playing a gig at the Austin Senior Center tonight with Corky Robinson. Corky was the band director at Austin High for over 30 years and retired a while back. He's in his 80's now but still swinging. He's a hell of a leader and sax player. Always fun.  No one has dropped dead at any of these I have played over the past 3 years but there's always a first time. My CPR card is out of date but I think I'll be ready if it happens.

						    urlLink    Moscow during the tour, December 2003. Here I am pictured with Lenin, Czar Nick and Tolstoy.  I got this gig because, well I can play half way decent and the fact that WC's regular drummer couldn't get a visa due to back child support and alimony from some years back. His son is grown now but that non-payment has no statute of limitations. It stays with you. I could never understand giving into the selfishness needed to totally cut yourself off from your own kid. In a way it's poetic justice that he missed out on what was an amazing trip through Russia, Turkey and a quick stop in Cyprus where I finally got a chance to wash clothes.  That event and others from the tour follow.

						   I'm also an independent contract courier, working the third shift monday through friday. I go in to work about 2 in the morning and work until about 8:30. The job leaves me out on my own, a lone wolf driving with the big rigs and the folks moving in to Texas from the north. I swear I see at least 4 U-Haul trucks with car trailers pulling in to town every night.  The job sucks in many ways.  I want to build my drum student count up to a dozen from its current 4. Then I can quit this damn job. I rack up about 120 miles/day. They are really piling up on my van. Maybe cutting back a little. I'll have to gnaw on that a day or two before I let the boss know. Then of course they will have to find someone willing to come in at 5 to pick up the frieght I want to get rid of.  Yes cutting back on this job is the key.

						   I should start all my posts with this:  "I know this was supposed to be about drumming but..."  This whole Bush thing is reall pissing me off. Primarily the war (but there are other things as well, mabe later). I hate talking politics but I do so enjoy writing about it.  My wife and I have over 26 years of combined service in the US Navy so when I opine on the military and its uses I know from where I speak (or write) most of the time. We were fortunate enough nevr to be ordered into live fire but as members of the military there always was that chance. We knew this, we were taught this and we constantly prepared for this. So I take nothing away from our troops all over the world, some facing the possibility of death at any minute. They are the best trained, best equipped fighting force in the world. Devoted, brave and worthy of our national pride and support.  As a nation 9/11 not only woke us all up to our own volnerability, it also presented us with some unique opportunities to exploit intelligence, amass information, react to it and wipe out the "bad guys". Instead we (Bush) invaded Iraq(?). Let me tell you straight up that there are groups of US soldiers ready and willing to do strategic strikes on a sole target up to groups of targets. We are expert at inserting these forces, having them do their jobs and getting them out with minimal lives lost on our side and a clear message sent to those who wold harm us that if they screw with us, we will fight back with all the might necessary to eliminate the threat. I believe we could hane and should used this tactic against Sadam and his group of thugs. This is just one example of what we could have done instead of invading. So what did we (Bush) do? He (we) shipped over 150,000 troops to Iraq. Now we watch as a dozen soldiers and many innocent civilians get blown up week after week. In case you hadn't checked lately there have been about 1000 American lives lost and the number gets larger every day.  As soon as the intelligence was found to be bad -no- worse than bad, we should have started pulling out of there.  The scripted often clueless President Bush, who couldn't extemporaneously speak himself out of a paper sack, keeps spewing the same crap over and over again. He must lose in November. Kerry will waste him in the debates. Hopefully he will send him back to Crawford Texas for good in November.  Rant over.

						   There's a club out in the boonies (lago Vista) right on Lake Travis that I play regularly with 3 different bands. It's called Cabo Loco.   urlLink See it here   Last night was with the rock cover band "The Instagators". The place was rockin pretty hard. We were winding down and about to end the night when a transplanted wedding reception came pouring in. We were extended another set with extra money (the prime motivator) and kept the place hopping for another hour. They love us there. I must say that our agent loves us too. This place has all the perks other clubs shoud have...free meal, cheap drinks and friendly staff.  It really was a terrific night.  My new ear plugs work really well in cutting the fatigue factor. At age 46 I am finally protecting my hearing.
