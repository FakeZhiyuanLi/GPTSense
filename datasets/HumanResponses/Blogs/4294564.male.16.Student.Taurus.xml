        Guess who's back, that's right folks it's me the C...O...Double N man.  A lot of people think I have went missing since I lost that unfortunate election last October but have no fear I'm hiding in a lair with the Baha Men and the other guys from 98 Degrees. I've got a lot of thoughts on my mind and I'm hear to share them with the rest of the free world. Let me tell you one thing, this is going to be no holds barred. None of that  restrained back crap. You won't see an edited Connor, you'll see in all of my PG13 GLORY! Remember that comment I made about Pat Guerrette's older brothers. I'm sure you don't, but people aren't really keen on dissing school "legends". Well I stand by those comments! And I'll proceed to insult every famous Deering alum,  Nik Caner Medley: Come on Nikki boy, there are so many cooler crimes to commit then Disorderly Conduct. Perhaps larceny or arson. Chicks dig larceny. Besides spell your name properly, only insanely famous celebrities deserve to have their names have messed up spellings.  Linda Lavin: Come on folks, she hasn't been in a movie since 1982. That speaks for itself.  Bob Marley (Not the reggae singer for all you folks outside of the 207): I seemingly have nothing against this guy. He is a pretty funny guy. Although his appearences on Super Secret Movie Rules sucked ass, but then again don't 9 out of 10 of the people on those VH1 specials?  Ok I'll run the gamut of other famous celebrities in the 207  The guy who played Greg Brady in the Brady Bunch movies: Umm.....I got nothing, besides the guy was on Captain Planet. You can't fuck with someone that was on Captain Planet. Believe me I've tried so many times. But he did guest star on 7th Heaven. Fucking pussy show (And suddenly Joe Tounge stops reading this blog)  The guys who created Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Come one TMNT III. What asshole is going to believe Mutant Turtles are gonna somehow  go back in time to Ancient Japan? Even when I was five I knew that movie was shitty. Which is saying something, I loved Moonwalker when I was five.  Stephen King: If he's so good, then why did he direct Maximum Overdrive? Although it did star the immortal Emilio Estevez.  Judd Nelson: See Linda Lavin, except replace 82 with 92.   Victoria Rowell: Apparently starred on Diagnosis Murder. If you're here to see me compliment Diagnosis Murder, I won't do it.  Liv Tyler: Two words: Jersey Girl.. Four more words: One Night at McCool's.  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: If he was so great then why is he dead?  Alright you like that? Uh? You like that? You see I won't get in trouble after someone's bitching. Why? Cause no one's reading this! Well that's it for now, come back tommorow maybe I'll have something. Hell come back in an hour. Maybe I'll have something then.
