       I find it interesting that life after Highschool should be like flipmode. I have all but lost contact with my former best friend of ten years, made an old nemesis a best friend, rebuilt friendships, and bridges for that matter, with old enemies, and dumped all who I held close. I also LOVE my work *sales associate at wal mart= cashier* which is something I never thought I'd say. Things are going well for me, and can only get better. Tomorrow I am buying a webcam which I will use to send my Alex bear pics of me while he is in Costa Rica, then I'm going to work on a digi cam so that I can easily make albums of my next few vacations/adventures.

       What is moving on? Is it finding someone new? Is it just being happy after the aftermath? Is it just being happy? Or is it finally putting a close to the discussion? Tommy spoke about moving on, but he never told me what it was. For all we know I did it months ago. Wrong. But I am doing it tonight. I am putting an end to the discussion, because I have moved on. I have fallen in love with another person, tried, tried and retried with someone else. Rebuilt friendships, built friendships, found honesty and trust in other humans. I've known pain, I've lost loved ones, I've acknowledged HIS moving on. So now I acknowledge my own. *waits for everyone to take a big sigh of relief* Why should I continue to lay awake at night in anguish thinking and rethinking all the ways I've gone wrong. Why should I constantly relive every happy moment only to know immense sorrow two seconds later because I can't get over the fact that its over. I can't say those feelings will go away, and I never, NEVER, want to lose those memories. What I do know is that now I can have a better more confident grip on things. Besides I didn't exactly completely fail, we still remain good friends and I enjoy our conversations. I know that one day he might pass out of my life forever, but I hope and pray that it is good terms. And with that said I am going to start fixing things immediately.    Mike out

       A few nights ago I had one of those dreams that you can't get out of your head because it either 1. Terrified you, or 2. filled you with immense joy. In the dream I was laying by an open window in a crystal tower. I was shedding tears for my beloved Alex, and looking down into a open city square. In the center of the square was a large fountain ejecting sapphire water. Then I looked up toward the horizon and saw two missiles fire toward the city. Quickly an immense force field erected itself around the city limits engulfing the two missiles. The dream was awesome. It was emotionally charged, the imagery was vivid, it was like watching a movie. The air was sweet and clean, the sky was remarkably blue, the fauna had an intense brillaincy and the entire city was made of crystal. It was lovely.
