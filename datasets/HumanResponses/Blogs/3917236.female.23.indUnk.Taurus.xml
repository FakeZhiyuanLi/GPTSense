       okay, so i had this crappy job calling BMW owners for customer satisfaction surveys, and it was lame, but i could color and do crosswords, so it was tolerable. i met some really nice peeps, and we started hanging out at my place from time to time.    so i met this girl, and i liked her alot. she wasn't a dumb chick like some of them are, and since all of my good friends are males around here, i was cool with the idea of becoming friends with this girl.   we hung out a few times; she came over to bbq, we went for beers another time. but she started calling me like 4 times a day, and always at a bad time. i have friends that i talk to 4 times a day, but not everyday, and i've known them a really long time.   she would always call and call, asking me to go do this or that with her. now, having a 2 year old i was not always avaliable, but even when i was, i always said no.   she hasn't called in a month, probably, and i really feel bad because she was a nice girl who i had things in common with, but i just didn't have the attention to spare. why i feel like i can't afford the energy it takes to become close friends with someone...i don't know, but i just feel like an asshole. it's not like my life is packed with exciting things to do or people to talk to....in fact, lately, the most stimulating conversations i've had were online, not even in real time....which sounds totally retarded to anyone who has frequent conversation in real life (and to me as well). i thought about calling her the other day, but i think it's too late, cause i have NEVER called HER anyways.....i'm a lame-o, i guess

      today is HOT. it is 101 degrees out. the breeze is blowing like a heater into my house. hazel got her first big girl panties yesterday, but she keeps peeing in them. she does fine in just clothes with no diaper, but for some reason, she still hasn't gotten the point. needless to say, i've had a pissy morning:P  i have real coffee again, and i am very thankful for it as i will never be drinking peppermint coffee again for the rest of my life. this post is coming out to be very uninteresting and dull, so i will quit while i'm ahead(i really am behind, i think, but 'quit while i'm behind' doesn't sound too good and i'm not feeling much more creative than that).

       ahhh, birth control. my favorite.&nbsp; Hazel turned 2 a couple weeks ago and the time just flies. it's very odd when you sit down and analyze your own childhood in relation to the fact that a whole new childhood is unfolding before you. there are alot of experiences that you want to sheild your kids from, but you can't. and i think back to alot of the things my mom never knew and realize that it all came out pretty well, and i'm not sure if it was dumb luck that nothing terrible ever happened to me considering some of the situations i put myself in, or if i was really as smart as i thought.   and that brings me back to birth control. it is the biggest challenge that anyone could face to bring up an intelligent, empathetic, responsible person. you can't control every aspect of their experience, so you resign yourself to that fact, but it's giving them the right tools that you must worry about.   the thought of having any more children in this world just doesn't appeal to me. especially considering that there are, in my opinion, just as many stupid and cruel people in the world, if not more, as good people.    a good example was this movie, 'the butterfly effect' that we viewed last weekend. it was very good and original, i thought, but the premise was that childhood experience leads ultimately to what you become in your adult life, and in the movie, one character had the ability to go back in time, already knowing the outcome of events that had already taken place, and change them. meaning well, he tries to repair the damaged lives of his friends, only to make things worse. which brings me to my point...meaning well is one thing, but you never know the true outcome until it's too late.    there are gaggles of stupid, cruel people out there procreating, not thinking once about cause and effect, raising children who will grow to be fucked up individuals who will in turn spawn more fucked up individuals who will cause pain and destruction in the lives of the ones i love.   and the really terrible part is, the same people who i would say are raising their babies all wrong would likely say the same about me. the world is a really fucked up and scary place, after you add people to the equation. i adore my daughter.   My Solemn Oath To The World:   i promise that i shall not bear any more children onto this planet, and i apologize in advance if hazel alice june grows to be a nuclear scientist or a theologist or any other evil practice.   as for me, i say IUD!!!!!!!!!

       Many people are at a loss for a response when someone says, “You  &nbsp;don’t know Jack Schitt!”&nbsp; Read on and you’ll be able to handle the situation intelligently.    &nbsp;   Jack is the only son of Awe Schitt and O. Schitt.&nbsp; Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O. Schitt, a partner of Kneeddeep &amp; Schitt, Inc..   &nbsp;   Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt, and the deeply religious couple begat 6 children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt and the twins, Deap Schitt and Dip Schiitt   &nbsp;   Against her parents’ wishes, Deap Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout.  After 15 years of marriage, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. Noe Schitt later married a Mr. Sherlock, and out of devotion to her children, decided to hyphenate her last name and became Noe Schitt-Sherlock.   &nbsp;   Dip Schitt married a woman named Loda Dung, who became Loda Schitt. The couple produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt.   &nbsp;   Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, inseparable throughout childhood, subsequently married the Happens brothers. The local newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding, which was quite an event. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Burd and Hoarse.   &nbsp;   Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He returned from his travels with his Italian bride, Piza Schitt.   &nbsp;   So now if someone says “You don’t know Jack Schitt”, you can beg to differ. You not only know Jack Schitt but everyone on the Schitt list!

      i think i will not have any peppermint coffee this morning. it just doesn't even appeal. i started a small fire in my toaster when i lit my ciggarette on it this morning. i forgot to pop it up when i was done and a big chunk of carmelized onion off of a previously roasted bagel caught fire. i started to smell some thing good in the air...i came back in and it was ablaze. my 2 year old daughter came in and pointed at it; 'hot' she says. well, yeah, that 's hot. now i need a new toaster. i don't know what it is , but i go thru alot of toasters. i have only actually been in a position to own my own toaster for about 8 years now, but if i have it straight, i must have gone thru at least 4, maybe 5 toasters. a couple of them did just spontaneously quit working, but i lost two of them to cat piss. yes, it is very foul, i know. there's nothing like the smell of roasted cat piss in the morning. it will clear out just about anyone from just about anywhere. my friends cat was living with me while he tried to get his shit together and he(the&nbsp;cat, named siggabob-boo)&nbsp;started this pissing war with with my cat and two of my toasters was the cost of that conflict. at this time i still had 8(eight) cats, yes, i know that's a ridiculous quantity of kitties, but the just kept coming???? anyhow, i now am down to one kittie cause when i moved here to the high desert from the valley they all got eaten by various desert creatures. the only one left is the one i don't like. his name is shitty kitty. he got that name because right around the time he showed up, there were litte kittie turds all over. but we have come to find out since then that he was framed- he does not need a litterbox even now and does all of his business out of doors. but the reason i can't stand himis because he never shuts up. i do not get a cat so that it can bitch and howl at me constantly but apparently that was his understanding of the deal...

      I do have to say that Swiffer is probably the single most ingenious invention of our time. It's time to mop the floor and I actually get a little giddy cause I get to play with my swiffer. It's the housewife's best friend, I tell you. And when I am finished, i get to rip off the oversized maxi pad full of dirt and other even grosser stuff, view it, wrinkle my face in disgust, and throw it in the trash. You see, to me, seeing the dirt on the pad is like my reward, and this is a kind of gratification that you never got with your old-fashioned mop and bucket. You would mop and wring, mop and wring, then mop and wring again, try not to throw your back out lifting the bucket to dump it, and then stand there and puzzle as you dump the yuck muck down the sink, 'how on god's green earth could this floor possibly be any cleaner that when i started now that i have diluted the dirt with pine-sol and spread it all over my floor?' Praise be to swiffer and any swiffer reps out there who want to send me some free pads(those bastards made them so spendy cause they KNEW we'd be junked out on them).

      I have been drinking peppermint coffee for a week now. Someone gave it to us and I know why they did, now. I am about to freak out. I enjoy foofie, flavored coffees once in a while, but come on...peppermint is a whole nother deal. After i brushed my teeth this morning, instead of the coffee washing the taste of toothpaste out of my mouth, the peppermint coffee just intensified the refreshing flavor, which you know, if i wanted my mouth to taste refreshing, i would quit smoking (hahaha). And being how today is rent day, you can bet that i don't have a dimeto go getanyother variety. I think that peppermint coffee should be avaliable ONLY during the holiday season so as not to ruin that silly little bit of excitement i would have had had i been drinking peppermint coffee in the snow, at Christmastime. And that's all i have to say about that....:P

      I am going to include here my pc first aid kit. When I was stuck in the mud, having had all sorts of viruses and spyware and trojans, these are the programs that healed me. Done with Kazaa? Learned your lesson the hard way? Click here for a  urlLink Kazaa remover  Also, this is a link for a free program called  urlLink Spybot: Search and Destroy . It removes most of the nasties, but not always all of them, so other programs are a good idea.  urlLink SpySweeper  is another one I use to back up Spybot. What one won't remove, the other generally will. When you do find a little bugger, this is a  urlLink library  of all of the known ones (I guess) but either way you can learn more about your problem. And to cut this short, this last one is an  urlLink online virus scan  that's free, I have more stuff to try if none of these fix it...let me know...

I will take a solemn oath today to try to be as clever as I am able, for the sake of entertaining all of you who will/will not be reading this. I will however, say right now that I can not be held responsible for: rolling of eyes so that they get stuck, choking on any material as a direct result of ha-ha-ing and/or guffaw-ing, general irritation, and instances of your pc suddenly commiting suicide by jumping (hmmm...) out the two story window.

       the whole weekend was an exercise in partying and realizing that i am not as old as i feel.   i stayed up till 5am, drank a gallon of beer, smoked 800 ciggarettes, scrounged up nickels and dimes for some late nite taco bell.   just like the old days.   i haven't been away from hazel in a long time. it's hard to remember the individual thats left somewhere inside after you have babies.   she's still there, she just doesn't get alot of time or attention she used to.   while i did enjoy having 72 whole hours to live life on my agenda, i also realized that i am far more comfortable at home with my baby than at the bar with everybody you slept with in high school(either directly or indirectly).      i'm glad to be home
