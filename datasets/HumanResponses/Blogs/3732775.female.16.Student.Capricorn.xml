      Haha, This shows how different I am! Ok, when I'm older I'd love to own a bar, Be the original coyote, like on Coyote Ugly. I want to have the girls dancing on the bad, the fire get lit on the bar counter, play the Devil Went Down To Georgia and some I wanna be a Cowwwwboy music and just it just be a crazy as hell bar!  Then...I want a very cozy small coffee/juice bar hosue and have open gig night and people come and put their artwork on display and poetry and it be always a lot of regulars. I'd like it to be like a nice place for people to just go and sort out their thoughts. I picture like big red comfy sofas, little wooden tables and lamps and it be set up like it's a nice town in Italy, like the walls be brick and just have the scenery of Italy, street lamps, flowers, alley look, etc. It will just be a very art influenced enviroment.   So yeah, a nice relazing cozy enviroment, art infuenced, and then a crazy as hell, fun, wild enviroment, infuenced by part'ay animals! haha

      Well tonight I've been called heartless, a bitch, full of shit, and so much more, also close minded and many more things. All because someone feels as if I play a game with their mind, so they go and TRY to play a game with me and try to hurt me to show me whatever. Well what the heck? If I even do, I don't try to. And I said I was done and we could just stop talking, well when I say that, he wants to keep talking. But if I want to talk, he is a ass. Oh yay, I just got a txt message, It says his feelings are, He's been stepped on, shook-up, nervous, let down, mournful, bitter, heartbroken, and when I feel all that I should let him know I am wrong. The he says ...Love you. I can't even believe he loves me with what he says.   Anyways, I think I'm seeing more clear about Thomas. At least I hope because I like what I see and it's not complicated it's just happy.  Next week I think I'm getting a job at Garfields, then I will get to work with Shara, that will be so much fun!   I'm about to give up on web design, it's fun but confusing sort of and I get frustrated with it all. haha   Gosh  Angelina Jolie is perfect . lol Well, goodnight everyone! Aloha

      I'm just sitting here watching The Fabulous Life of Prince William and Harry. And..wow. They are SO rich. And so powerful. They can do whatever they want. They are soooo lucky. I hope later in life I have a lot of money and stuff so I can have the best vacations with my family and husband whenever I want and just do huge fun things. I'd love to leave a lot to my children and family also. And be remembered also. I wish I was a princess. haha I wonder if living with a Monarch goverment is that bad, I think the United Kingdom is doing pretty good. Wow, Harry has more money than William, But William get's to be king so I guess that's fair. He get's soooo much when he is king. Anyways, I'm just amazed. Anyways, Angelina Jolie amazes me so much more. I'll write about her sometime, there is no way I can say everything I'd ever want to about her though. She's working on her pilot license right now, that's so cool. I'd love to learn to fly, I'm going to hopefully get my license just for fun someday. It isn't that expensive really. Oh, well Ashton Kutcher is on now, and I've already seen this, but gosh he is beautiful so I can't let this distract me! Aloha

      Hmmm, Just starting this baby off! I'm just going to talk about what I did last night. Well Lauren came over and stayed the night. We watched Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I don't think it was as scary as some people said it was. I mean, the only part that would scare me is right when the guys pops outta nowhere! But when he is out there and just like chasing them and stuff, I'm not really scared. lol Jessica Biel is a good actress, I wish she was in more movies. She was the only survivor and she had to like put 1 of her friends out of misery. That's horrible. I wouldn't know what to do, I could never kill a loved one or I don't know if I could ever kill anyone. But I think if someone killed a very close one like a loved one such as a parent or something and they did it for the heck of it, well that doesn't matter, if they did it. I'd give them the worst life ever if they didn't end up dead by me or someone else. That's just so sad. Anyways, we also watched Mystic River, about murders also. It was good. Both of them were, Texas Chainsaw didn't have much of a story line, I didn't expect it to. I looked up the "based on true story" story. It was based on a guy named Ed Gein and he did some cannablism but he didn't use a chainsaw, the guy writing the story came up with that, anyways, Long story, I'll tell you later if you want to know. But Mystic River was good, kinda sad because of one thing but I can't give it away, you'll have to watch it! Well, there are some movie reviews for you. What else can you expect from me? haha I'll get back on this later. Aloha
