      I first tried Dragon NaturallySpeaking years ago when it first came out.  PCs back then lacked the horsepower to do more than open screens, select menus and provide some rudimentary dictation.  Now I have spent most of the last 12 hours playing with the latest version, and in fact am writing this by dictation, not by typing.  It seems strange to spend hours teaching your computer how to recognize simple commands that an accomplished geek can mouse and type in a fraction of the time.  I have to admit though, that there is something oddly compelling about seeing your words appear on screen and watching the program learn the vagaries of your speech patterns.  I write a lot of essays on various web sites and part of me thinks that this will actually save typing time in the long run.  Frankly, the program is going to have to do more than that, because I type more than 100 words a minute.  The other thing that concerns me is that this will turn my writing style more conversational.  Perhaps it's appropriate for a blog, but the style is probably not appropriate for writing that pays for my bread-and-butter.  I can see the application for e-mail and other informal communications, but this is going to have to take some getting used to.  And, no, I never end sentences with prepositions unless I need to do so for effect, but I have been doing it ever since I started talking instead of typing.  The art of dictation and the mysteries of stenographers now seem less of a lost ritual.  Perhaps business people four decades ago developed their own style and rhythm that allowed their work to appear more business-like than this stream of consciousness that NaturallySpeaking creates.  For now, I feel like I'm doing all voice over on The Wonder Years or The Waltons.  Meanwhile, I feel  strange sense of exhilaration when the program recognizes the word Waltons without me having to spell it.  I get the same feeling when the program continues training, and I no longer have to spell words, but simply choose one of the proffered corrections.  I thought Zuma was a waste of time.

      I have no idea how they're going to monetize the traffic, but  urlLink Linked In  has legs.  How strange is this?  Tonight, for the second time in a month, I found someone who works in my department of 2 dozen who was linked to me by four degrees of separation and across the country.  I always found the Six Degrees experiments fascinating.  That someone who sits fifteen paces from my office door is linked to me via the COO of a soon-to-be-public company blows my mind.  I also wonder why he didn't do what I did and searched for people at our company, but that's a topic for another day.  I see two obstacles.  The first, and potentially biggest, is acceptance.  Businesspeople don't want more contact.  (Actually, smart businesspeople do, but they want it filtered.  That is supposedly how the site functions).  Meanwhile, I've sent about a hundred invitations and have a web of 32 strong.  Not bad, but not as big as it could be, and certainly not big enough to create what Malcolm Gladwell calls a  urlLink tipping point .  The other big challenge is how to monetize the traffic if people do visit.  If I knew how to pull off that trick, I wouldn't be here blogging on a Saturday night, but would be in my luxury suite, paid for by Linked In's investors.
