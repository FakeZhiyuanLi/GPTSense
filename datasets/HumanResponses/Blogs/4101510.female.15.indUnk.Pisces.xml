       I wonder if you ever wonder where you’ll go with this   I’m just as caught between the things you never seem to miss   You’ve silenced me to a position where I cannot even resist   And now hold me beyond limits I never knew to exist      You stole yourself away from me   Twisted into this thing I can’t see past   And I’m caught in the tornado you stirred across this barren plain   And I’m becoming the very thing you didn’t want to see, so fast   And we’re changing for better or worse, barely keeping sane      Please tell me if you can hear me breathe   It’s getting harder with every single beat, tearing at the seams   Cause the silence won’t give you the time of day, won’t wait   Nor will the stars shine down to keep you straight   My own life drowning me at a quickening rate   So, tell me then,   Tell me, when   When will you meet the beauty of fate?      You’re the only one who ever got me on the floor   Put me below all I thought I could control   So just let me go, you’ve got your fix   If you need me    [I’m sure you don’t]   Just reach out and touch my soul    [You’re stronger n’ I know you won’t]   Defiled and no longer dominatrix   I’ve been waiting for the return of all you stole   Only you can undo your deadly tricks      Please tell me if you can hear me breathe   It’s getting harder with every single beat, tearing at the seams   Cause the silence won’t give you the time of day, won’t wait   Nor will the stars shine down to keep you straight   My own life drowning me at a quickening rate   So, tell me then,   Tell me, when   When will you meet the beauty of fate?      Please tell me if you can hear me breathe   ‘Cause my hearts sinking with the weight   Crushing the breath right out of me   Just know it’s not too late   Just know it’s not too late   Cause fate always arrive too late

       My life is held by a thread in your hand   The kind of pain I know you understand   In the lingering doubt I can't leave behind   That you have still something more on your mind   Something more I have yet to find      I'm worn too thin to try and prove   Now it's your turn to make the move   I'm lost in checkmate, simply numb   Realizing it's to this I've succumb:   Hiding the truth would kill me more   Than your lying would be worth it for      Do you know how much I'd give for you?   Eternities I'd gladly suffer through   If I could contract your growing pain   In your joyfulness my misery'd be gain   My misery's my joy if you're happy again   But you can't hear if my spirit's slain,'Cause...      I'm worn too thin to try and prove   Now it's your turn to make the move   I'm lost in checkmate, simply numb   Realizing it's to this I've succumb:   Hiding the truth would kill me more   Than your lying would be worth it for

       So many words haunt me   But I can't let them go   I just can't let them go   For fear they might not return      I hate to admit its hard to see   And I don't know what my actions show   'Cause you just float above, I'm below   The words don't seem to be your concern   And how to speak 'em, I have yet to learn      And I'm finding it hard to believe   You could ever say these words to me   I'd never imagine as long as you breathe   Not that it's bad, quite the contrary   Last thing from you I thought I'd receive   This is just simply unexpected as could be   But it wouldn't surprise if my ears deceive   For in your truth, what's been honesty?   Just make sure this is honesty

       Break, break, bring me down   Shatter, shatter my very will   Thrash, thrash me to the ground   Go, go, go in for the kill      How many times have you watched me drown   In the essence of you, standing still   Hopessly hoping your silence might resound   Off this hollow heartyou ignored with such thrill   But when you hear the silence make it's rebound   The echo's waves will send a violent chill      The gravedigger's done and left the yard   Yet you still linger amongst the graves   (The living haunting the dead)   You're only as strong as the lies you must guard   The truth of me you didn't wish to save   (The bittersweet deceit you lead)   Listening to your heart becoming heavy and hard   The weight's crushing my own to be brave   (We're breaking as one with the dread)      Watch, watch through the red that flows   Tremble, tremble through your hands it's fleeting   Stare, stare in horror as it moves so slow   Yield, yield to the lies you're greeting      Here in the graveyard, six feet below   How can ignore my heart thats still beating   While silence should be the only echo   Off this truth you're numbly defeating      The gravedigger's done and left the yard   Yet you still linger amongst the graves   (The living haunting the dead)   You're only as strong as the lies you must guard   The truth of me you didn't wish to save   (The bittersweet deceit you lead)   Listening to your heart becoming heavy and hard   The weight's crushing my own to be brave   (We're breaking as one with the dread)

       How long did it take   You to find the single star   Your new love to make   My dreams seem so far   While you're in the wake   Of finding who you are      It softens your heart each night   And lightens your burden each day   Your joy is wonderful to my sight   And I'd do anything to let it stay      Don't think of this   My love for you will never leave   Just continuing finding your bliss   'Cause you know you're all I can see   Even if I silently miss, you'll know   My love doesn't mind sweet misery      In the silence, thoughts that are mine   When alls quiet before the fading eve   When you can see that with me, alls fine   It's softly slitting my heart to believe   Though I won't let you see me out of line   I won't let you know what I can't relieve   It hurts just a little each time   It only hurts when I breathe   It only hurts when I breathe      Don't think of this   My love for you will never leave   Just continuing finding your bliss   'Cause you know you're all I can see   Even if I silently miss, you'll know   My love doesn't mind sweet misery

       What if the darkness falls,   And no one cares to save?   What if death calls,   Who leads me to the grave?      What if the blood was mine,   would You know what to do?   What if I was running out of time,   Would my last words be to you?      And what if You're my all,   And I'll follow the way You pave?   What if this is the Greatest Love of All   Who's blood washes me like a wave?

       Leave behind my broken spirit   That you molded unknowingly   Find your way, climb out of the pit   That pulled you down with me      Looking up from six feet below   Let my grave be also to your pain   Looking up, let me watch your joy grow   And see your smiles through the rain   Don't look back as you joy meets me sorrow   For through my sorrow, your happiness is gain

       Your presence lingers all around me   Although you’re no where near   Longing for all that I can’t see   Pain feeding on my fear   Trying to push it far behind me   It’s my voice you can’t hear      The sun and moon disappear in the mist   Drowning you out of my sight   The mutilation is hard to resist   While my life’s in your hands tonight      Can you not see yourself?   That I’ve hidden in my heart   Reflected in the essence of myself   You are, clearly in every part   Of you, I’ve found in no one else   We’ve changed so much from the start   Of this bind, alive off each other’s health      And not you,   But you thought you were so smart   That you could just rip out my heart   And shove it back for a new start   But it doesn’t work that way,   It just doesn’t work      The sun and moon disappear in the mist   Drowning you out of my sight   The mutilation is hard to resist   While my life’s in your hands tonight

       I can see you falling   You're falling softly away   Falling into a love again   Side to side, up and down you'll sway   You climb out, only falling in again      In and out of love you'll fall   Remember, mine's not the same as what you call   "Falling in love"   This is constant, steady and the same   Only growing to cover what's needed for new   Since you can't fall into what you must tame   This love will always be there for you

       Ashes to ashes   Another Day   Another year   Older, older   The rips and slashes   From the love you say   You hold so dear      Shifting from the darkness you were in   So close to the edge it’s almost gone   You can feel your own blood run   Closer, closer   So beautifully broken   You watch the breaking dawn   Tossing your heart into the sun      Closer, closer, and closer   To where you lose all that you won   Just toss your heart into the Son      Smile to smile   Another lie    Another scar   Farther, farther   The hand that’s so vile   Breaking your blue sky   And who you are      Closer, closer, and closer   To where you lose all that you won   Just toss your heart into the Son      Sunshine to Moonlight   Another sigh   Another love   Soaring, soaring   Escaping from the night   Up so very high   Truth raining from above      Shifting from the darkness you were in   So close to the edge it’s almost gone   You can feel your own blood run   Closer, closer   So beautifully broken   You watch the breaking dawn   Tossing your heart into the sun      Closer, closer, and closer   To where you lose all that you won   Just toss your heart into the Son

       Enveloped in the cold, swirling flakes of white   Frozen in this stance, my heart fell numb   Frostbitten on that cold winter’s night   My feelings slipped away with the breathe in my lungs   Realizing I wasn’t meant to win this fight      Autumn’s fallen leaves covered my transfixion   That fell numb to the sting of winter’s frost   Shards of the shattered ice shone with the conviction   Of succumbing to the grips with all I’d lost   And spring’s first dawn will bare the benediction   For my first breath that’s free of a cost   Held in your light freed from past’s constriction   Drawn away from the lines I’d crossed   You showed me away from the rupture I crossed

       falling into the broken pieces of your mad estate,    losing your mind cause the logic can't equate,    with the ideals of grace that shattered your debate,    against the powers of something so amazing and great   Deduce any further,   and padded walls are all you'll see at this rate   Padded walls are all you will see

       Silence is golden   But it's blinding me now   The peace it brought's been stolen   From the words you burned with somehow      Silence is golden   But it's blinding you tonight   Remembering hopes and dreams stolen   Your watchin' the world through hindsight   Punches and stabs that just kept you rollin'   Have finally broken your roughened heart tonight

       Beyond words this beauty does lie   Reflected in the twilight of night's dark sky   Touched by our souls that live and die   Felt in the tears of sorrow's cries   The skin that's just true beauty's disguise   The truth I find in the beauty of your eyes   Is where His true beauty lies      I can't describe this flaring grace   That burns darkness from this secret place   Bringing light to your entrancing face   The simplicity it does interlace   With my broken strategies win life's race   In His creation, in you I see his grace

       This night shines brighter than heaven's light   As if we're searchin' the sky to find solid ground   Every discovery but our goal shines bright   In the stinging truths we've found      It's always this or that, never in between   As a whole, you're either wrong or right   Through tradegies, comedies, and romances I've seen   The fantasimal tales that drag life's truth from sight   To hide it with color's beauty, they're keen   But even technicolor comes down to black and white   The plain truth is there in black and white

       You were the one who turned   Without reason then,   Begging me to come back,   To come back again,   But you left me...      Broken and Branded   By the iron from your fire   Fueled by wooden spikes you abandoned   Drove into me by your selfish desire   Took my trust and left me stranded   Leaving the rest of the world as liars   Back to me my heart you handed   Bleeding, dragged through a briar   You've left me broken and Branded      Then you looked inside   Through the shield of my eyes   My numbed heart that lied   You saw the truth,   And found my heart...      Severed and Bleeding   You found my broken heart   Realized just what I'd been needing   Took my hand and held each part   And the fears they were feeding   Faded when I felt the pain depart   With the lies now receding   For you gave me a new start   My heart's no longer Severed and Bleeding   But this brand will still remain,   This brand shall remain

       You screamed you'd wash away the pain   And the haunting memories you'd lain   Upon the tired shoulders of my soul   Of which I fear I've lost control      I can longer trust you   When you said," I'll do the things you cannot do"   When I thought I'd finally found something true   Was when I lost my trust in you

       Everywhere is the face of the one I miss   I can't escape these reminders that keep my bliss   And the simple wish to taste a sweet, forbidden kiss   How long 'til I make a reality of this?      Your touch still lingers on my skin   Your presence entering every time I breathe   Penetrating my soul within   You're everything that I believe   Keeps my spirit from caving in   Only alive 'cause you still breathe      In your arms I found my pride   Hiding in your hold when I didn't need to hide   You held the key to find the way inside   Hopeful and awaiting, even when you're gone   In my heart you still abide

       People come and people go   One part of life we can't control   These are the lives you love and know   The lives that can make or break your soul   The love you give is the love they'll show   For all you reap is from what you sow      For with everything you know is true   Amongst the lies we twist and skew   It's more than your words, it's what you do   That shows yourself to those precious few   Cause one day they'll ask if they never knew,   Is this my life to you?      For whose lives you'd give up all that's dear   Trading your own to destroy their fears   For whose hearts you'd give up all your years   A loss that would cause unceasing silent tears   The love you've got to make crystal clear      For with everything you know is true   Amongst the lies we twist and skew   It's more than your words, it's what you do   That shows yourself to those precious few   'Cause one day they'll ask if they never knew,   Is this my life to you?      And with everything I know is true   It's more than your words, it's what you show   That let's me see the things you might do   And I'll ask 'cause I still don't know,   Is this my life to you?   Please tell me   Is this my life to you?

       When you broke my pride you broke my arms When you wouldn't let me protect you from harm You broke my arms from holding you From the times that were sweet but few My own idiocy caused these bruises, black and blue My prideful soul that you broke into With your truth you claimed but I knew wasn't true Still with everything you dragged me through I somehow still manage to say, " I love you"

       It's my heart you don't understand   There’s very few that do   But when you drove in the screws   You lost the key by your own hand      Again you're banging on the door   But this time you won't get in   I won't let you strip me like me before   When you broke me from so deep within      You'd marred and shoved me away   Blurring me out, burning every trace   And contempt's now taken its bind   You want back in you say   It's just this self-anger I can't face   You won't again control my mind      You want back in you say   I can't, not yet   Not yet, Not yet      Once melting from the taste   Of deceit's entrancing kiss   Though after knowing truth's gentler touch   'Tis not something I will miss      This time's without my promise   But maybe some possibilities   I won't settle for an ignorant bliss   When all I desire is for reality      You'd marred and shoved me away   Blurring me out, burning every trace   And contempt's now taken its bind   You want back in you say   It’s just this self-anger I can't face   You won't again control my mind      You want back in you say   I can't, not yet   Not yet, Not yet

       I lie here in the deafening silence   As tears threaten to leave my eyes;   Provoked by the thoughts of defiance   That smother all these lies.    These tears searing down my cheeks   Sharply sting as I come to realize;   My own mind and heart are so weak   From failing at all my tries   To attain all I did seek;   All so worthless in these eyes.    Broken and I think of You,   Silently crying out of fright   My heart and soul severed askew   'Cause everything's wrong and   You're all that's right,   And there's nothing I can do,   While fear still grips me tight.    But I simply fall speechless,   Touched by Your invisible light,   By Your peace no longer tense,   Now safely in Your sight,   Embracing me through the darkness,   I fall asleep in Your arms tonight.

       There's a darkness breaking through   Waiting to tear your heart in two   I can see it growing in your eyes   And yet you still don't realize   Your hiding in your own disguise    The simple lies that soothe your mind   You can't see through what you're behind   Trying to hide inside the light   Your only see what's in your sight   Blinded to it all by your own fright    You've got to seize the shining day   'Cause sometimes night can show the way   The truth is deep, the truth is wide   Their sight will show you not to hide   You know we're always on your side    You've turned away from the path   Come back and be saved from the wrath   I feel you've wandered off to far   Why can't you find your shining star   It breaks my heart seeing where you are    Come into this dawning sun   Where I know you won't need to run   'Cause only night can bring a new day   Where your own pain is not the pay   For this love that'll show the way    You've got to seize the shining day   'Cause sometimes night can show the way   The truth is deep, the truth is wide   Their sight will show you not to hide   You know we're always on your side

       My Wonderful, My Savior   How far did You go?   Can I truly fathom the    Great love You show?   Your blood from the nails;   How far does it flow?    How can I understand this?   This perfect mercy and grace   This new peace Ive found   That's presence won't cease    My brother, my Savior   Where else could I find   Trust such as Yours?   Such unfailing friendship   With the one I so adore?   Is their any other of whose   Confidence I'm sure?    How can I understand this?   This perfect mercy and grace   This new peace I've found   That's presence won't cease

       Your new world is still swirling   And there’re so many answers   But you haven’t even matched them   With the questions that are whirling, whirling   All around your dizzy mind    Your crushed, beaten heart   Once broken by promises that weren’t   Is now beginning that new start   Just remember that you can’t look back   Can’t look at what first tore you apart    So where to now?Where to now?   You can’t return   Only follow the questions into the new life   To learn, to learn to breathe again   Through redemption’s lungs   To teach, to teach your heart to beat again   With redemption’s blood   And you can’t look back    You can’t look back    Everything’s so surprising   And the blur’s still clearing   But you have yet to stand before   The tension of doubt that’s rising, rising   Around your growing soul    Your curious, wandering soul   Is now searching this open truth   To restore what the lies stole   Just remember that you can’t turn back   Can’t turn to what first dug the hole    So where to now?Where to now?   You can’t return   Only follow the questions into the new life    To learn, to learn to breathe again   Through redemption’s lungs   To teach, to teach your heart to beat again   With redemption’s blood   And you can’t look back    You can’t look back

       There’s something impatiently waiting   Burning deep within this spirit’s eyes   A fire ignited by life’s passion   With the desire to soar in the skies    To shatter the world’s useless knowledge   And learn beyond simple-minded sight   Looking for what it truly means   To show this earth the wrong from right   Flying in the thunderous storms   And breaking with you from the night    Flying with you to the new dawn   And seeing another day to live   Meeting the spirit’s passion   Finding what life’s gonna give   I can’t do this while alone within    Watching the new light leak over   This ever changing, twisted world   The freedom begins to form itself   As the trail with you becomes unfurled    I’ve been pushed to the very edge   And they’re waiting for me to stumble   They’ve watched me crash once   But I won’t fall and crumble   To their twisted, crooked path   I’m ready to be turned and humble    Flying with you to the new dawn   And seeing another day to live   Meeting the spirit’s passion   Finding what life’s gonna give   I can’t do this while alone within

       Twisted and torn by this ricochet   Too many times, and still I resist   Trying to stand on my own    With strength that doesn’t exist   Wounding myself even deeper    Show to me Your healing grace   I’m still lost, searching this place   Longing to see Your beautiful face    Ready me to be refreshed,   In Your shining essence,   Put me back together,   Draw me to Your presence,   Show me how to be free   I’ve reached the breaking point,   And it’s where I need to be    Stumbling into my own trap   Comfortable in my own pain   Shadows moving in my heart   Where Your light should reign   Where I know You need to be    Come now and break me   I’m still blind, unable to see   That I need You to set me free    Ready me to be refreshed,   In Your shining essence,   Put me back together,   Draw me to Your presence,   Show me how to be free   I’ve reached the breaking point,   And it’s where I need to be

       Everyday you worry how to live   By the standards of the world   Gel your hair straight?   Or Maybe perfectly curled?   Like the media tells us   As the trends come unfurled    Is my size one too large?   Or I just can't run as fast?   Are these the right brand?   Just a few of so many we ask   So second nature it tends to    Be such a part of the past    What will they think of this?   Is it okay to say that?   Negative conclusions reign   In our minds from the world   It seems nothing's sane   In this twisted vortex   of depression and pain   Yet still in this time   Your seething soul remains    Waiting for it's pointless approval   That you may never fully get   Worrying over the smallest niche   Making such a fuss and fret   Doing things you'll never need   If you have it all, your set    Don't let them steal you   Away from me, my friend   Your mind is your own   Not theirs to wickedly bend   Yours to grow and build   Yours beyond the end    What will they think of this?   Is it okay to say that?   Negative conclusions reign   In our minds from the world   It seems nothing's sane   In this twisted vortex   of depression and pain   Yet still in this time   Your seething soul remains

       No one ever cared   To reach out and ask   Taunting was all they dared   To give you in the past    The twisted lies they told   You began to sorely believe   Slipping from hope's hold   Yet never able to leave    Searching for a trust   A hope to hold onto   A freedom of the mind   To find something true   Someone who truly cares   For you as only you.    I've been there too   Broken and shut out   Everything seemed blue   Pain's what it was about    Though you think you're lost   Soul torn on the cold floor   You showed such a trust   Like I'd never known before    We were searching for a trust   A hope to hold onto   A freedom of the mind   To find something true   Someone who truly cares   For you as only you    I'll try to show you trust   And a hope to hold onto   Give you freedom of the mind   Show you whats true   'Cause I truly care   For you as only you.

       Hanging in the darkened shadows   Where the twilight watches us fade   Where my soul, with others, grows   As night and day continue to trade    So many times I see   Others trying to leave this place   Crying out with a longing plea   To let the sunlight on their face    My voice cried out once with theirs   With the hope to find a new trail   To move away from fleeting stares   Sorely daring to think I would fail    You are the answer to my call   Helping to finally fix my wings   The arms that pull me in line   You let me bring out my all   The light unleashed that sings   You’re the one who let me shine    You’re courage encouraged me   Your wisdom let me understand   Your radiant spirit of beauty   Has shown me the grace of His hands    When you gave me your wings to fly   Finally feeling life’s amazing breeze   Up so high in the cloudless sky   A light I’ll never need to leave    You finally let me see the sun   And gave me a living chance   Though we’ve barely started to run   We can finally rejoice in dance    You are the answer to my call   Helping to finally fix my wings   The arms that pull me in line   You let me bring out my all   The light unleashed that sings   You’re the one who let me shine

      I've watched this world for so long So long around me, keeping it's own pace The same routine, the same old wrong Still running it's worthless race  I've always heard the world's ideals It's paths and roads twisting me away So many poor souls it's bait reels So many times it's lead us astray  Still Stumbling over our own pride Piling burdens to rot on shelves To give ourselves an easier ride Shoving every wrong under the rug Hopelessly hoping it will hide We're victims of ourselves  This place I'm apart of Where my soul once wandered Playing fool to it's twisted lies This place I've searched over Where my hope's been slaughtered Hopelessly, too many times  But I've breathed something new Bursting more sweetly with every taste Turning skies from black to blue It seems all else was a waste All a waste compared to this A sight of beauty in new eyes Exploding with sweet, wonderous bliss Truth smothering the world's lies  But life's still gonna go on With no promise of candyland The road will still be long But now I'm able to stand With support beyond strong Under His comforting hand  This love I'm apart of Where my soul is comforted In the arms of a love so strong This love I've searched over Where my hope's been lifted From shadows its been in so long  No longer victims of ourselves, No longer, no longer victims of Hell, No longer, no longer victims of impurity, No longer, no longer, no longer But rather, victims of eternity

       I've seen better days,   Looking in the face of insecurity.   It just seems so hard to praise,   'Cause I'm falling in uncertainty.    I'm spinning, lost in this crowd.   I can stil see you smile as I'm gone,   Just as I can say right now,   Today everything is just going wrong.    I'm pushed away for another day.   Tucked away until the next.   Losing, falling like the way,   Waiting at the bottom with the rest,   For the coming better days.    Waiting so quietly with the hope,   And wandering through these dreams.   Assuming its the only way to cope,   Until you can break the seams.    Daydreaming comes to an end,   As the sky fills with stars.   Falling to where dreams can bend   To the fantasy that seems so far.    I'm pushed away for another day,   Tucked away until the next.   Losing, falling like the way,   Waiting at the bottom with the rest,   For the better coming days.

       I’ve said it so many times now   In silent and uncertain ways   I’ll say it again aloud   As I have every other day   Every day I’ve wanted to scream   Scream so only you’d hear what I say    But I can’t scream over the thunder’s sound   As the rain falls through my soul   I fade away, to see you through the rain   Floating above my words that wash to the ground   I see, for the moment, it carries away your pain   For the moment, your sorrows have drowned   The day when you can say you’ve found…    You’ll find her a reason to breathe   Not me as you love her   You don’t love me as you will love her   I don’t think you do   And I don’t want you to   I’ll simply soar with your joy   Your joy when you find her   When you find your reason to breathe    Just soar with wings you said I gave you   And find the happiness you’re meant to receive   The one you’re waiting to find   She’ll make you happier, I believe   Give you more than I ever could   You’ll find her a reason to breathe    You’ll find her a reason to breathe   Not me as you love her   You don’t love me as you will love her   I don’t think you do   And I don’t want you to   I’ll simply soar with your joy   Your joy when you find her   When you find your reason to breathe    But slowly as she shows you   How two become one   Different yet the same   Joy that can’t be undone;   Just silently remember my name   As you find your reason to breathe

       What are these things you won't let me see? You've shown so much of yourself already Why stop now? Why stop now? If I've wronged you, please show me how  Your confidence in me now glistens with fear Your distance conveys your thoughts too clear: Would my careful touch kill if you came near? My soul screams to reach so only you'd hear Love, please, remember, dear, Thing's aren't always quite what they appear  I'm finding it hard to believe You'd ever say these words to me Lingering every time you breathe For in your truth, what's honesty?  What's behind your glowering eyes? You won't tell me truth, won't tell me lies Just know it's your integrity you compromise When your silence is the figure of my demise The choice of reputation is faith’s despise When you can’t see behind the shattered glass   Of my breaking blue eyes

       what is it about the rain always inspiring these foolish rhymes as if they could wash away my pain or dance my tears away sometimes there goes my sanity down the gutter drain the storm blowing the wind chimes  anger flashes in the lightning screams ringing in the thunder's sound rain's mist where the chorus of sighs sing rhythm in the fists of rain beat n' pound the storm seems to be the very thing like a cure raising up from the ground  it's the inspiration for all these foolish songs sometimes echoing with my silent lonelieness or the words that say, "you're the one I miss" dripping with the simplicity of lingering bliss but it always seems to boil right down to this  it's a never ending cycle I try to numb cause it's hard to use the thing you hate even when it's where love is from I don't leave such things to fate emotion isn't something to which I succumb I won't be controlled by what I hate  just confused again, laying wet on the floor why would you waste your time here I know you wouldn't, it'd just be queer I'm just behind your wheel and I can't steer even the rain can't hide me, it's clear  but I can't see you through the rain but I don't think you'd want me to again I'm not sure I'd want to be sane  it's the inspiration for all these foolish songs sometimes echoing with my silent lonelieness or the words that say, "you're the one I miss" dripping with the simplicity of lingering bliss but it always seems to boil right down to this  but I can't see you through the rain but I don't think you'd want me to again I'm not sure I'd want to be sane

       Out witting the shadows that conspire and writhe   Igniting fear in the heart of darkness   Flares raising the spirit of life to oxidize   The first breath of your elemental existence      Choking upon a new way to breathe   The air's so invigorating, fresh and clean   You never knew until now just what to believe   This is your life like you've never seen   Rapturing light, burning what you couldn't relieve   When they say to live, this is what they mean      You've come to awaken from your numb estate   Revealing secrets hidden within your thoughts    The soul unleashed from a burden so great   You're learning all you could never be taught   You've nearly severed these chains of fate   Freedom from all the broken idols you sought   Chasing the truth so you don't have to wait   The truth you don't have to wait for anymore      Fresh, hot blood pumping through a broken heart   Mending the wounds that death created worse   The fire's branded you before redemption's start   This hot iron rod to tell the story of your curse   'Cause if you forget every shattered piece and part   You'll only find yourself goin' again in reverse      Just let the spirit bind to the fire blazing bright   Listen to the hiss as it's strength defeats the night   Just listen and find...      You've come to awaken from your numb estate   Revealing secrets hidden within your thoughts   The soul unleashed from a burden so great   You're learning all you could never be taught   You've nearly severed these chains of fate   Freedom from all the broken idols you sought   Chasing the truth so you don't have to wait   The truth you don't have to wait for anymore   You don't have to wait anymore

       I can’t believe these thoughts These hidden dreams that I conjure Breaking my faith in what I sought Missing you, it’s myself I injure Forced to see I am entrancingly wrought By man’s lies I try to deter Missing you, it’s myself I injure More than you ever could  I’m falling as the rain to admit defeat I admit, I look in every wrong place I admit, you’re as weak as I am I admit, you can’t give this grace We love each more than we think we can It’s not a meaningless embrace But I admit, we are only human And by our strength can’t win this race Frail as breath, we can’t win this race  This simple wish I succumb Seeing your joy is my desire That one day to you it might come True joy, that will take you higher Higher than I could fall from What you were meant to become True joy, that will take you higher Higher than I ever could  The rain is falling so go take flight Spread the wings you’ve found Let it wash as you fly in spite In spite of it weighing you down Let it wash away this night  I’m falling as the rain to admit defeat I admit, I look in every wrong place I admit, you’re as weak as I am I admit, you can’t give this grace We love each more than we think we can It’s not a meaningless embrace But I admit, we are only human And by our strength can’t win this race Frail as breath, we can’t win this race  And I miss you by your face And the past you can’t erase By love held with hidden disgrace I admit to you, I miss you  We love each more than we think we can It’s not a meaningless embrace But I admit, we are only human And by our strength can’t win this race   Frail as breath, we can’t win this race

       I'm sorry I couldn't give you a fairy tale To make all your dreams come to true With pieces that couldn't even hold themselves up I tried to create a fairy tale for you  I've torn myself apart trying to put you together And I've become the shadow in the back of your dreams Bringing on your nightmare I'd not want to do a thing that could ruin your "forever" All I wanted was to be the wings to take you there  I'm sorry I couldn't give you a fairy tale I've torn myself apart trying to put you together Fighting the nightmares in your dreams, I fail It can hurt more to lose a fantasy, than returning to a world so pale I'm just sorry I couldn't give you a fairy tale  I feel I've become the nightmare in your dreams Just the shadow you mindlessly kill out of fright Something you wouldn't notice or realize The heart that should be bleeding red and bright Doesn't beat, but it's bleeding blue tonight  I'm sorry I couldn't give you a fairy tale I've torn myself apart trying to put you together Fighting the nightmares in your dreams, I fail It can hurt more to lose a fantasy, than returning to a world so pale I'm just sorry I couldn't give you a fairy tale  I'm sorry I couldn't give you a fairy tale I've become the shadow in the back of your dreams You'll see exactly what reality brings 'Cause all I can do is pray for your happieness And just become the shadow of your wings

       You've stumbled upon my poetry blog.  Here, you will find the largest collection of my poetry that I've put together yet, though it is probably still under some construction.  After awhile, this layout will most likely change, but put up with it for now.
