      I suppose I should just go ahead and explain what "Countdown to Mad Max" is really all about.  Just in case someone stumbles upon it...  I'd hate to have strangers thinking I'm some kind of Mel Gibson fan, or even worse, a die hard Mad Max / Thunderdome fanatic.  No, no, no.  See, me and a friend have a theory that eventually, possibly very soon, part of the US will turn into a scene wholly resembling the post-apocalyptic scenario laid out in the Mad Max movies.  Namely, we believe that Portland, Oregon will turn into a mirror of Mad Max, starting with a micro-Thunderdome in the South Park Blocks area, and eventually turning the entire downtown area of Portland into a gigantic tangled web of torn-leather, naked bodies, and such.  Anyone else notice the transformation already occurring?  I can't walk through the park blocks without encountering what I call a "Mad Max'r".  They seem to be multiplying.  I plan on taking covert digital pics soon... I'll post when I can, but I fear if "they" ever see this blog, they'll "terminate" me.

      it's true.  you can't please everyone at once.  in fact, i think i've found a general principle: you can't please more than 4 people at a time.  this principle has come to light recently on road trips, during numerous jam sessions (in the form of live shows and informal improv jams), and also through various other social interactions.  a funny but clear example from tonight...  6 men in a room trying to practice for the unpredictable: an improv, ambient musical experiment from behind a wall, all in support of an employee art show at an unnamed (but long-standing) cultural art institution.  1 left (read: went home) from being 'too unstructured' and because we "changed keys" in the middle of a song.  another left because we were playing "songs" and he thought it was going to be more 'unstructured' and more "noise".  the remaining 4 of us jammed for an hour+, although 1 of us had to take repeated cigarette breaks.  ha.    we'll see how the art show turns out.  i just want to make sure we stay low key and don't undermine the actual artwork, artists, and lookers-on.  my parents happen to be coming in from the southeast US the same day.  let's hope they like the project too.  now of course, there are always exceptions to the rule.  i must admit i've had a few 6 person jam sessions lately that kicked ass.  major ass.  3 guitars, 1 fender rhodes keyboard, 1 bass, and a drum kit.  kickin'.  got it all on mini-disc and now dat.  cd too.

       this photo from edward weston, ca. 1927, shows a beautiful nautilus.     the nautilus is a striking example of the golden ratio in nature:        urlLink http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF7/716.html          it is only coincidence that the above article mentioned greece (a timely coincidence, and fitting for the night, no doubt) in its discussion of the golden ratio in architecture!

       okay, so after the first bit of theatrics, the "procession of nations" was very cool.  frankly, i was surprised to see such a positive and warm (almost roaring) reaction from the mostly greek crowd when the US athletes made their entrance.  i had assumed almost everyone in the world hated us at this point.  the usually inane bob costas made a comment that most greeks make a clear distinction between US foreign policy and government (which they have many reasons to dislike, going back 50+ years) and US citizens.  good to know, bob.  seriously, it is good to see so many different people from all corners of the globe in one peaceful assembly.  very good.

       well, here we are.  as i write this first post, i'm watching the sappy opening ceremonies for the 2004 summer olympic games in athens, greece.  it will be nice to see the actual games back on their home turf.  let's all hope we don't see any violence.  i hope that 'the golden ratio' will serve mainly as an outlet for my never ending stream of thoughts.  i don't know if i will ever share this blog site with anyone, other than those who stumble upon it.  i will probably use this a place to record musical ideas (bits of lyrics and chords and melodies), philosophical thoughts (maybe *that's* why we're here!), and political frustrations (damn that W).  maybe i'll jot down some of my ideas for software and other technology too... who knows...
