      I smell liek coconut.. i am bleached blonde...i am getting peirced.. though the poking date keeps getting moved back further and further. in two weeks even if i have to go get a butcher at 'that which will not be named' peircing shop where i got my second tounge piercing done...i will have my hood ornamented...spelling on that last word?  Ive come to the breaking point...though its wavered a fraction of an inch on either side...i dont talk to anyone on the internet that lies or risrespects me or the human race as a whole...i buy one thing for myself thats frivilous each pay day(at least) im trying hard not to be so sensible and to go out and be y0oung and carefree once in a while...a perfect example of this is sunday where we will all going on the fintry queen for service industry night...the problem is that i work ALONE on monday so we'll see how 'hard' i go...ill be a pansy i can almost predict that.. but i would have sacrificed the sleep necessary to be young so it evens out.  Im also obstaining from any form of penial to vaginal penetration.. i would be able to say penetration of all kinds but i was fingerbanged last weekend..it was great. The guy never disapoints me. though i promise that i did nothing to spur it on.. except have an inviting arch to my back...and an occasional moan escaping my parted lips. its amazing what these tiny reactions will do to a man.

      I wrote this a while ago but i think its still valid ish...  im sick of not finding anyone that i make sense to. im sick of saying how lonely i feel.. and having someone say that im not. im sick of sleeping with people that i'll pretend or want to forget about in a few years. i think im the sadest ive ever been. and thats messed up..cause i dont feel all that bad its like ive just kind of accepted that i'll never find anyone that i conect well with on more then one level at a time...that i'll never be able to be my entire self in from of anyone that im 'with' and that on the nights when i am alone, talking to my cat about how much i love her and how happy she makes me wont seem as weird one day.  but even acceptance which once made me smile an inside smile.. just to know that i knew what was going on...just doesnt do it for me anymore. its a spill thats all. i would say the same things to the walls.

      Ok ok....   &nbsp;  So i was reading the 'cruel site of the day' and they were talking about how important smell is to everyone.. how people who lose their sence of smell can become quite depressed and all of that.. and it got me thinking... i realize that smell brings back memories...and the site made refference to perticular 'first gf/first bf'. With my first SERIOUS boyfriend (its been&nbsp;about a year ago since we broke up.), the only smell i can think of that i could ascosiate with him is his god damn armpits...he used to have this weird obsession with explaining how important it was that i enjoy the smell of his armpits...because people who belonged together liked how they smelled.   Im sorry....but if i ever have to smell that 'rotton sweet onion meets marajuana and has sex in bleach' smell again i PROMISE i will go balistic. another thing that pissed me off about him&nbsp;is his stupid phone voice....we lived together for a little while after we broke up and he talked on the phone like a god damn faggot. 'Aloh ha!' all smooth and musical sounding...i just kept thinking..&nbsp; man these poor girls or other faggots&nbsp;that he's mackin on&nbsp;REALLY dont know what the fuck they're getting into. Were so stupid...(girls and faggots), any one guy fakes an injury of their morality we run straight to them. Well...maybe not all girls.. and not me anymore...but anyone that has or will ever be with that loser sure will...the game gets old though, thank god. And god knows i learned alot for the whole experience....i better never smell another fucking armpit again. Im serious.

      I was thinking back today...the relationship that i had with my x jason.  it was bad from the start...but i just let everything slide.. cause it was so quick and so fast with EVERYTHING that happened. It started on a lie that his brother had died...then he told me he was in jail and stories slowly started seeping out about who he was and the kind of life that he missed...he lied to me about being with a hooker...it progressed into stealing money...keeping things about girls a secret...and the demeaning of my self worth..and finally ended in a quick hold of angrey violence...im not saying taht i didnt fight back.. or provolk any furthering of an argument...but i did know how to control my words...when to say the things he needed to hear to be encouraged and feel usefull...when in actuallity he really wasnt usefull untill we broke up.  A girl at my work is married to a guy that sounds like my x bf...the belittling...the name calling.. the degradding actions towards her...jelousy...telling her that your family is too close...violence in anger.  It makes me so scared for her...and so happy to know that i can recognize how to NEVER let myself just let things slide to that point again. I hope to god that she realizes that though shes married to the guy..and though she made a concious decision to love him it doesnt mean that she has to stop loving herself and putt9ing her well being in the highest priority. when your happy.. you make others in this unhappy world happy... right?

      I can feel winds of movment within me...change is calling for me to come find it and im not sure which direction to look to. What i do know is what i dont want and that, though i sometimes give in to the weak and worthless expressions of my inner being, I will not play dumb. I do what i do, knowing full well the impact upon my soul. This is not always desirable.  When winds move in me like this i do one of two things...I deny myself the urge to run....away or towards...and sit there ever so dormant waiting untill the next scent of home, or I talk myself through it and i take a leap and hope to GOD that there's one of those mats that you use in elementary school for high jump to catch me when i get over the pole. Blue and so giving supporting yet floppy under your flesh...populated and crawling with the friends that you've known since kindergarten (which seems like forever).  My water is quickening...i can feel my life taking off...my role of becomming a real adult with roots that nurture the rest of humanity with their ability to absorbe and produce is becomming the key to my own childish undoings.  The fire within me...is consuming all areas of wanting to live for someone else...to care for anyone else that i do not draw strength and possitivity from. It is making me understand acceptance and penetration of ones life into my own.  My own heart has become aware...and bleeds into the only reality of earth which is humanity and makes me understand the necessary evil of choice.  I choose....  I choose....  I choose to not yet have comprehension at my finger tips...to live at least one more day to say the things i need to live my life by to be accountable for what ive done or undone today. I take into myself the grace that God has given me to be a pathfinder to myself and a light to all of those who are behind me. I am gratefull i am humble enough to see the footsteps and lights of those who have gone ahead. Thank you.  Praise be to choice. and to love, to hope, to peace, to honesty, and most of all to the pursuit of truth. and ultimatly to God for his regulations of this dimension.  Share the texture of your life with everyone.

      Speaking of fries...J was one short less then a happy meal this morning. and i met a man today. J talked the whole time while she was wired up on caffiene and no sleep and he didnt even pimp hand her once!  what a sexy fucker.  ******  After further contemplation im annoyed that J talked the whole time...i was embarressed that she did that and didnt take any of my hints that maybe she should go to the mall.. and i hope to actually have a conversation in person with the interesting and sexy man one day soon. He really is a sexy fucker though!

      dead ant dead ant!  So i have ants. a RAGING amount.  Everytime i go through the kitchen.. and i see them i war dance....i roll their tiny crunchy bodies around, beneath my feet so that i know that their dead (if you only step on them they are strangley ok.. and still running around when i lift up my stompers)...so then i squat like a native tracking the great beast, and have a look to see which ones are still moving. if i see any that are... i squish them with my pointer finger. Dead Ants.   here is my theory.  If it so happens that i skip the final step of the 'sending them out to sea' burial(aka flushing them all down the toilet), and leave them on the ground for more then say...15 minutes. these DEAD ants...are carried to their lair by their rescue ranger ants, and brought back to life with an ant ZOMBIE potion called 'dulcis venator' (translated into english that means sweet hunter). and instead of brains that take away the pain of dying...they come out on a sugar bent sneak sneak sneak hunt attack.  So most of what im killing now are zombie ants.  But its good 'cause i think that all my war dancing has been paying off...were down to mini mini sized ones...except for the odd stray one that was out of the kitchen territory and searching for casualties of the sidd-a-nator in the bush (living room carpet area).  Maybe the Zombie ants have a maximum relife rate of 7 or something.  P.S. I have tried looking for those little tin cans of ant poison but i cant find them anywhere...they only have ant bombs.. and i cant do that cause i dont want to bomb sidda. my sweet sweet furry pussy comrade.

      So theres a mail man that comes to our office. he wears the little blue postman shorts, which his ass looks alright in.. but, BUT!!!!, he has a god damn mullet! its SOOOOOO 80's.  so anyways.. he comes in.. and asks for a cup for the water cooler and so i tell a coworker whom i'll refer to as 'mirnando' where they're hidden in the top drawer , she hands him a cup and and he goes onto take a drink...  ***** Today im wearing that top that i wore at my bbq like 3 months ago... for anyone that was there you probably didnt realize i was even WEARING a top, as my tits were on constant display...since then ive learned that if i cross the straps over my head my tits are decently(ish) contained..though i didnt do that today. (spank me im so naughty) *eyes rolling*  ***** it goes together, just hold on to yourself!  ***** So while the mailman was filling his little plastic cup, i decide to stretch...then i sit calmly at my desk and talk to a coworker we'll call him kevnando...and then he walks away and i catch this mullet sporting mail carrier looking in my general direction. and so i look around for what he's looking at...as i glance down... LOW AND BEHOLD there are my tits sitting there like a friggen baugette on a german bakery's counter.  I start laughing...SO EMBARRESSED! and i say to mirnando....'Mirnandao did you see that!?' (reffering of course to my breasts.) and she turns around and looks at me along with teh mail carrier...and she of course doesnt know what im reffering to since ive already hiked my shirt up! but HE!!!! HEEEEEEEE says..in the SLEEZIEST voice ever 'I did.' *gives me the one brow raise 'i know you want me'.'  smiles and walks out of the office with an extra little bounce in his step.  *TURNS BEAT RED* OI.

      Its nice to recognize yourself in a song...kind of borrow the songs alikeness into your own heart..so you dont feel so alone...its important to see simularites in the world around you... it keeps you grounded...and sane. however you do it...whatever you relate to.. i can see the value of it i can! You relate to the fact that things probably wont ever always be like 'this', where ever you happen to be... but its sad to form your life around a specific song strictly to belong to some kind of emotionally pathetic and deflated mindset. Just because you have never developed teh thought pattern to choose one of your own. Its like looking into a mirror and deciding your prettier then someone else, and you have a better personality then most of your friends...just because you repeat things you read on the internet and take credit for their sassyness...or you read it in cosmo...and claim you didnt know! Looking in a magazine to be two steps ahead of everyone else, this is teenagey behavior to me.. and its difficult for me to understand cause im not there anymore.. i was hardly there as a teenager for god sakes! Its pretending your all sweet and all pretty and then you let something like 'that' fly off your fingers....or off of your tongue. Who wants a presence like that? who wants a responsiblity to lift someone off the freakin ground just because they listened to a song that depicts a sorrow that made them fall, so that person just falls down to be there with it, keep it company.  stuff like that bugs the hell out of me.  I guess were all guilty of it...not being ourselfs sometimes....but when someone makes it their lifes value, to not ever be themselfs...thats just living as a false idol.. and you begin to not even exsist anymore. you dont deserve to exsist.
