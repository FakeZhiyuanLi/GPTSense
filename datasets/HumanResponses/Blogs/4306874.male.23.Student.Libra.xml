      An independent comission has released a statement saying that a terrorist attack with low-yeld nuclear weapons in the next decade is not only possible, it's innevitable.  Great... now I live better. Knowing that some crazy-ass Mohammed is "innevitably" going to nuke my hometown (maybe...).  As if people aren't scared enough with bio-terrorism and chemical warfare (and the ever-fashionable car-bombs and waist-bombs), now we're told that, like in a lottery, some of us will be nuked to oblivion within the next ten years. Maybe you. Maybe me. Maybe all of us.  Who cares? Que sera, sera. If a madman with a tourbant nukes my backyard, chances are I'll never even know what happened until S.Peter coughs in the gates of Heaven to get my attention away from the Gameboy Advance.  Still, it supports that which I believe in: The world is racing towards it's now-officially-confirmed inevitable doom, and surprise, religious extremism is behind it all. If there's a God somewhere, I'm sure She's really pleased with us.  That reminds me, I've read an interesting article where it says nuclear weaponry are probably "soul-killers". Let me explain: If souls exist, they must be a form of energy. Even people talk about positive and negative charges, or whatever.  But a nuclear detonation disrupts every form of energy within its blast radius.  So that's a nice thought. Unless God upgrades the Soul System to a non-disruptible form, when you die, you go to Heaven... provided you weren't nuked. Then it's just curtains and the eternal darkness of non-existence, I'm afraid (is non-existence black? Does black exist in non-existence?).  You know you've evolved as a race when you can kill people even after they're already dead.  Bless us, every one of us.

      Just heard this nice bloke I know from the web has had twins. These are his 4th and 5th kids. Man, oh man... That's a lot of input for a 30-something.  You know, that guy is really really lucky. That is my ultimate goal on life: To have at least ONE kid. I just want one, for starters. I'm not greedy.  I'd make a good dad. I've worked with kids before. I worked in a prep school and at Summer Camps, and I've done my baby-sitting stints. Kids just seem to like me from the start. I'm the kinda guy you see in supermarket lines making funny faces at kids.  There's just something that draws me to it, creating life, then refining it. Pointing out the good and wrong of life, playing God to an extent to something that is, for all intents and purposes, YOU, upgrade v.0.1 (or in this guy's case, v.0.4a and v.0.4b... HA! I kill me...).  It is, and should be, the ultimate goal in life. People waste time wondering "Why are we here", and the answer is in the eyes of the first child they come across.  Either that, or they've never had kids of themselves.

      Just finished watching "Cube" a few minutes ago, on this lazy Sunday night.  What an interesting little film. 7 people are thrown into a huge structure, a cube, made up of smaller cubicles, each the size of a small room. Some are booby-trapped, some are not. This group of complete strangers must pool their skills to try and find a way out.  You know, it's great to know that while shit like "King Arthur" and "Catwoman" is hurled from Hollywood, there's still inteligent people out there related to the movie industry. Except most of them are not in the U.S. anymore.  Case in point: horror. Hollywood has forgotten how to make horror. While stupid shit like "Scream 15" and "Freddy VS Jason" is being made, the brits give us jewels like "28 Days Later", "Dog Soldiers", "Deathwatch" and "The Bunker", the japanese give us more "The Ring" trilogy(forget the terrible american remake) and "The Eye", and even the spanish are in the loop.  And judging as to how there's only remakes coming out of Hollywood, I say let the US movie industry drown itslef on its own shit. The rest of the world has not forgotten how to make quality cinema.  And above all, not forgotten that horror films are about scares and tension, not about blood and naked teen chicks.

      So my mother comes to me and says what an outrage it is that the germans have unveiled a monument to their WWII soldiers who died in action.  Have they not suffered and died same as US or British soldiers? Were they not also fighting for an abstract notion that their leadership was told was the right one?  Things like this make me a bit confused. People tend to see "evil" soldiers as in an Indiana Jones flick: faceless, evil automatons.  Well, guess what? They were young men like myself and so many others, who wanted to be there as much as the brits or the yanks. I say this homage was long overdue. And enough with Schroeder's apologies over WWII. You don't apologise for history. You only live through it.  By the way, that idea about blowing up the Siegried Line fortifications to make room for housing projects?  BAD IDEA, ASSHOLES!! Because just as you don't apologise for history, you sure as hell don't destroy it. Do it, and you're no better than those Taliban who blew up the Budhas in Afghanistan.  This might be a good time to say something somewhat controversial here: I'm a nacional-socialist.  That's right.  A nazi. I'm a nazi.  Does that mean I have a shaved head, hate jews and burn crosses in my backyard?  No, and I'll tell you why. Because those people aren't nazis in the true sense of the word. They're racists. Simple as that. I'm not. I have friends from all races, creeds and colours, and the net was instrumental in turning a big world into a small one. Hardly room left for racism.  So I'll go a little deeper into this to try and make myself understood.  I believe in national strength, the protection of a country's economy and culture from foreign influences (such as the European Union), the establishment of tougher and simpler laws, investment on education and defense, exploitation of a country's resources with as little import business as possible.  That is the basis of national-socialism. A political party based on internal growth.  And a good basis it was, until Hitler decided to throw a few totally irrelevant issues into it. Namely, racism and anti-semitism. Those are the elements of hitlerites, not real nazis. All those people you see in the news buring crosses, spanking foreigners, listening to racist heavy metal wearing stupid uniforms and with names like "Arian Unity" or some crap...  Those aren't nazis. I feel ashamed of being confused for those people, but I see why that happens. That happens because people such as myself with real political beliefs are afraid to come out and say it, out of fear of being confused for some skinhead brainless piece of shit following a long dead idea of a Reich and racial superiority.  That is nonsense. Being a nazi is like being a Democrat or a Republican. Or, in theory, should be. It's not, because the moment you say you're a nazi, people think of "American Histoy X" or the KKK. I repeat: those aren't nazis. They know nothing of the political basis on which it was based. They just want an excuse to kick people they don't like. They're weak-minded fools who need to feel safety in numbers.  And us, the few real people who actually have half a brain to distinguish politics from idiotic racial discussions are forced into seclusion so those barbarians can go around throwing Sieg Heils into the air in a display that only makes me feel like crying.  The problem is, there are few people who understand the politics behind nazism, but there are millions who understand the racial "apendix" to it. It's like having a fan base of a book built only on its footnotes instead of on the book itself.  Nazism has a valid motive for existing, for those of us who are tired of seeing "the big guys" running our country instead of us. We are losing our right to determine our own fate, instead becoming dependant on regional powers who care little for your nation. I DO hate seeing foreigners coming here and mocking the laws of the country where I was born, but I'm sure you don't have to be a nazi to feel that. These are normal feelings for those of us who love our country, as I do. It's not racism.  The word nazi became an insult, but it's used in a wrong context. We nazis have a word for what YOU call nazis, those bald guys with the tattoos: hitlerites. They follow Hitler and his racist views, they do NOT follow the political side of the party, merelly the racial. And believe me, we hate them as much, if not more than you do. Because of them, the "public" side of nazism, we are afraid to voice our views in public.  Needless to say, I've been in a fair share of problems in both highschool and college for my view, and I find it amazing. We preach free-speach, but when I exercize it, in school no less, to try and clear what I consider to be misconceptions on nazism, I get punished for it.  Never did I make a racist comment or an insulting remark, but the moment I affirm myself as a national-socialist, the game is over. Before I even get a chance to try and make my point that true nazism is NOT about racism, I am already being told to shut up and sit down.  But one teacher not only allowed, but encouraged me to talk. That restored my hope that maybe some people are willing to listen without preconceptions. That teacher was my mentor and my guide, as she saw my desperation at being unable to manifest myself. She was the one that told me I not only can, but should make my voice heard despite objections.  And that is why I'm here telling you this. At the risk of you reading this and thinking me a hitlerite. But it's a risk I'm willing to take. I know I'm not alone. There are other nazis out there who are mad at the people ruining our name, the "nazis" in the rallies and the concerts, and we just wait until they are worn out, when we can come out and say who we are, and explain to the world exactly what we're all about, it's not about racism, it's not about anti-semitism... it's about politics. Simple as that. Every nation on Earth has gone through a protectionist period in its financial history. All we advocate is a longer, more strictly enforced period.  We are tired of haegemonia. We want to achieve the balance between deciding your own fate and not getting delusions of grandeur in the process.  All there is to it. No racial bullshit, no men with small moustaches, no concentration camps, no uniforms, no banners, no nothing.   Just politics.  I'm a good man. I am well-liked. I do my good deeds, I help at home with the family, and I don't annoy anyone. I don't enforce my views like others do, I don't spit on other people's flags like some do on mine, yet I get strange looks on the subway for carrying the memoirs of Erwin Rommel, my personnal idol, beneath my arm. Yet people running around with Malcolm X and Che Guevara books are intelectuals.  Is that fair? I think not, and I'd like to be able to enter a discussion a say what I am without getting inslted for it before I even get a chance to try and clear misconceptions. I speak for nazism. Not racism.  And this is the important bit: And they're NOT the same thing, nor are they attached in any way. Nazism is not racism, racism is not nazism. You can be a nazi and not be racist, just like you can be a democrat and hate black people.  Of course, there's something more. We do have a cross to bear. Unlike Hitlerite zombies, we are ashamed of what Hitler made of Nazism. He had the opportunity to focus the world's economy in Europe, and like these blind fools today, he let racial attitude get in the way. Thus, he did unspeakable things, and brought shame to nazis all around the world.  You want to know when you face a true nazi? Ask him what he feels about Hitler. If he expresses regret about what happened, and a sense of lost opportunity to prove to the world that National-Socialism works, then there's a nazi in front of you. If he rants on about "Der Fuhrer", then he's just another hitlerite mongoloid.  Hitler could have built Germany into an industrial power rivaling the U.S., and all from a broken and defeated nation. He picked up a devastated country and turned it into the biggest war machine of the century. Now imagine if that power had been used for internal development only. THAT is nazism's testimony towards history. It works, and this was an extreme case.  Of course, then Hitler got delusions of grandeur, and decided to use said power to bring others to heel, instead of just defeating them in the trade arena. That was his mistake. A mistake we want to dispel.  It's not an easy job, but me and a few others will keep striving for it.  I remember an old Star Trek episode, in which the Enterprise comes across a planet that is a copy of WWII germany. Turns out a Federation scientist had studied all forms of government in Earth history, and he'd found that germany was the most efficient.  So what he set out to do was to copy it, only without the evil that surrounded it the first time around.  That is EXACTLY our goal, and that is our vision for the future.

      What do you talk about on your first blog post?  A short introduction? The story of your life? What your goal is, and what the blog is about? Or do you talk instead of how you don't intend it to be a diary, but instead a place to phisically drop your brain into?  I guess I should start with this: I'm not english, I'm not american, nor am I an aussie, canuck or from any other english-speaking country. So I'll surelly be excused for the ocasional flop in my typing.  See? A good first post. Practical, serving a purpose, in this case, a warning.  That should take care of that, but I guess I'll go with the cliché road and give a short intro to my personality. Not that you may CARE, but it should make reading the following thoughts a bit easier.  Right, I'm a 23-year old single heterosexual short blond guy from an undisclosed part of Europe. I'm a soon-to-be History student in college, already having gone through a different History course and a short stint at International Relations. My hobbies include movies, model-building and sea hunting, or whatever you call it. Big harpoon gun, wet suit, kill fishies. Harldy fair, but there you have it.  There you go. That's me in a nutshell.  Why, oh why did I choose to do this? Why create a blog? Quite frankly, because I find the idea of putting thought to word in a an accessible place quite appealing. people can even read and comment on it. Amazing what we can do nowadays...  So... the basics having been deal with, this looks like the perfect place to pause for a breath before moving on to the little bits inside my brain that may annoy and amuse people. hopefully, myself included.  When will I post here next? How should I know? Maybe I get hit by a car when I leave home tomorrow morning, and this'll never get updated.  Of course, then people reading this would simply think I'm negligent. So I'm here to tell you otherwise.  To conclude, if I don't post tomorrow, look under your hood. You just might be surprised.
