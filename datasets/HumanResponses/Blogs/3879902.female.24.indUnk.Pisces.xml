       This has got to be the longest day of my life. Still 2 hours from 6:00 and I can't wait to get out. I'm so restless.       Split Screen Sadness         And I don't know where you went when you left me but   Says here in the water you must be gone by now, I can tell somehow   One hand on the trigger of a telephone   Wondering when the call comes   Where you say it's alright, you got your heart right Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and wait on the porch 'til you come back home   Oh, right, I can't find a flight We share the sadness, split screen sadness Two wrongs make it all alright tonight      ALl you need is love is a lie cause we had love but we still said goodbye   Now we're tired, battered fighters And it stings when it's nobody's fault   Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name   It's only the air you took and the breath you left Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and wait on the porch 'til you come back home   Oh, right, I can't find a flight   So I'll check the weather wherever you are cause I wanna know if you can see the stars tonight   It might be my only right We share the sadness, split screen sadness      I called because I just need to feel you on the line    Don't hang up this time   And I know it was me who called it over but I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day   Don't let me get away Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me   So I can say this is the way that I used to be   There's no substitute for time or for the sadness   Split screen sadness   We share the sadness      Depression has hit an all-time low.

       I don't know where to start. This has been such a terrible rollercoaster ride. One day I was in Cloud 9 and the very next day I got slumped to the lowest of lows. Best friends? No commitment?! What does he think this is, a high schoolish thing? For goodness' sake he's about to turn 30! I guess I was stumped that I just managed a cool "yeah sure no problem at least it's clear now" but that night I wasn't able to sleep. And the following morning I suddenly broke down and cried. And everytime my friends tell me I should just forget about the whole thing, that I'm a better catch than him, tears well up my eyes again. Napagbuhusan ko pa ng sama ng loob yung dental assistant. I just couldn't hold it any longer. I had to speak up, otherwise my heart would probably burst.   So this is how it feels like pala, to finally fall in love. I was really willing to work it out with him, to help him in whatever way I can. But I guess his plans had changed that he doesn't include me in his future plans anymore. I used to hear from him that we'd last long because he knows I'd understand him and I'd help him out. And why does he keep talking about me wanting to get married by 27 and he has 3 years to prepare for it. Whoever said that was a sure deal?! A lot can happen in 3 years. By then we probably won't know where each other is.   But the weird thing is I really felt his sincerity with the things he has done for me. He wouldn't bother coming over my house, spend for me, show himself to my parents, but why has this happened?! I'd like to think he's so confused now. As much as I would like to understand him it's pretty difficult at this point. I don't want to see him nor his friends and wouldn't want to be in places where we'd  gone.    He asked me yesterday if I was mad. I said I don't know. He even joked about it. What does he want? He said he'll go back to my house to finish fixing my PC. I told him it was no rush and he should take his time. I guess he could come back after a month. I saw him pass by our office and our eyes locked for a brief second and that's it. It's so frustrating that he seems like he's being dense about the whole thing.    I feel sick.

       I feel so restless it's like I want to go home. I&nbsp;never thought things can be as complicated like this at this stage! And playing on my weakness - my being non-confrontational. I have to learn to be totally honest with him about everything. The learning curve is steep at this point.   Why does he have to mention this ex and that ex all the time?! Is that all there is to know about him? I can't believe I'm sort of in a jealous streak right now. And it's all because he didn't tell me where he was going last night, he only told me this morning! And all the while I thought he'd meet up with a different friend, because he used the term "kabarkada" and "friend" and not the usual "ex ko" like he always says. Now I'm so bothered I couldn't think straight. And now he's playing counterstrike when I felt like talking to him. Could it be that he's just waiting for me to open up? But I can't! I don't understand why I'm still embarrassed to talk things over with him when that's the first thing that I should do in any case. It's too hard... :(   It sucks when I'm stuck in a rut like this and I can't help it because of this stupid feeling I can't get rid myself of. It sucks even more when you realize that my feelings could be deeper than what he has for me. What if in the long run he gets tired of me and suddenly leaves me for another. At this point I can't bear even the thought what more in the future?   I'm secretly hoping I could talk things over with him if he asks what I'll be doing after work. If he doesn't say anything and he just bids me take care and goes home right away, it just shows there are more things waiting to be revealed.

       I'd like to think that everything is alright between us. It has been a week since "the end of me" but I'm still alive, and I guess happier than I could ever be. There had been times during this week that things seemed weird and I got so confused about the whole setup, but we cleared out things eventually. I initially thought that after last weekend things would have changed but it didn't. Eventually I realized I'm not ready after all to be seen with him here at work since word gets around so fast, even more so that almost everyone knows him. He said he wanted to protect me from rumors and the such, and that's fine with me. After all, he makes up for it when we're together outside anyway.    I just got more confused last Thursday when he started dropping terms like "being best friends", "taking it slow", "started getting to know each other", and the such, that I thought he is not my boyfriend as far as he's concerned. Felt duped when I knew he became my boyfriend the moment we kissed. But he assured me that everything is fine between us, and I was really indeed his girlfriend, and there are no pretensions whatsoever. He admitted he might have used the wrong&nbsp;words when what he really meant was we're just starting to get to know each other in this relationship. He knew I'm bothered that we're not official yet, and he admitted that he wanted it to be such in August, so people would not think that it was too fast. And it being the 8th month, the number "8" being forever. Now I'm wondering if he will propose on August 8 hehehe...

       Is this for real? Is this the one I've been waiting for?   Saturday was unforgettable. It wasn't just the three-hour videoke that made it such, but what happened after. I just have to say it was so amazing.    &nbsp;   This Kiss    I don’t want another heartbreak   I don’t need another turn to cry   I don’t want to learn the hard way   Baby, hello, oh, no, goodbye   But you got me like a rocket shooting straight across the sky     It’s the way you love me   It’s a feeling like this   It’s centrifugal motion   It’s perpetual bliss  It’s that pivotal moment   It’s impossible   This kiss, this kiss (Unstoppable)   This kiss, this kiss     Cinderella said to Snow White "How does love get so off course?" All I wanted was a white knight  With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse Ride me off into the sunsetBaby, I’m forever yours   It’s that pivotal moment It’s unthinkable This kiss, this kiss (Unsinkable) This kiss, this kiss   You can kiss me in the moonlight On the rooftop under the sky You can kiss me with the windows open While the rain comes pouring inside Kiss me in sweet slow motion Let’s let every thing slide You got me floating, you got me flying  &nbsp; uh oh... :)  I Love You  The sun is shining every day, clouds never get in the way for you and me I've known you just a week or two, but baby I'm so into you, can hardly breath  And I'm in, so totally wrapped up, emotionally attracted, so physically actin' So wrecklessly I need you, so desperately sure as the sky is blue Baby, I love you, I love you   I never knew that I could feel like this, can hardly wait till our next kiss, you're so cool If I'm dreamin' please don't wake me up, cause baby I can't get enough of what you do  And I'm in, so electrically charged up, connectically actin', erratically need you Fanatically you get to me, magically sure as the sky is blue, baby, I love you   I can't believe that this is real, the way I feel, baby I've gone head over heels  And I'm in, so totally wrapped up, emotionally attracted, so physically actin', so wrecklessly I need you And I'm in, so electrically charged up, connectically actin', erratically need you Fanatically you get to me, magically sure as the sky is blue, baby, I love you  Baby I love you, do you love me too? Baby I love you      &nbsp;

       What's that about? Napaamin na nga ba nya ako? I really suck at lying. I wasn't really supposed to tell him that, at this point, but oh well, it just came out. He wanted the truth. So there. And of course what's next? It would make me a hypocrite if I say I don't want him to become affectionate with me. So when he held my hand I squeezed his and held his arm. He knew I'm sweet and affectionate but I just don't show it. And so I did, for the first time that night. In the cab we held hands the entire time and he was kissing my hands, my cheek, my nose, my forehead, my hair. I&nbsp;just melted! *sigh* His face was so dangerously close to mine.&nbsp;I almost let him kiss me! I said no. If I did allow him, that will be the end of me :(&nbsp;He asked if I felt awkward about the whole thing, and I mustered a weak "No." I couldn't speak, I just smiled. He knew I was happy with what is happening.   Oh no. This is really serious. I do hope he's not joking around.

      I could say yesterday was a milestone. He asked me to go to novena with him and he took me home and I introduced him to my parents. And my mom was behaving the way I wanted her to! It was a pretty funny scenario. The moment we got to the gate the helper got out and chained the dogs. And everyone was there at home including my brother. And my grandmother even blurted out "Was he the one who took you home on a taxi at 3am?" And my mom shushed her for that :) My mom said he looks young enough to be mistaken for a friend of my brother's, and he looks nice naman daw. She hopes it's true. Quite positive feedback huh? I hope he comes over often and eventually have a chance to chat with everyone at home. We were in a taxi on the way home and he brought up the time I told him that it's hard to get used to these things when there's a looming fear that things will not last. He held my hand and said "Masanay ka na, kasi hindi ako mawawala." And then he stares as if his eyes are glued to my face. I gave him a playful slap on the cheek for him to stop staring. He just kissed my hand several times. *sigh* And what is this I hear that my boss knows about this?! I can't believe it that the big bosses would actually talk about this trivial matter. Now I'm embarrassed :P I wanted to text him the lyrics of a song that more or less expresses what I'm feeling now. It was too long to be a text message so I just sent it through Friendster. It's "When I'm Thinking About You" by The Sundays. He has yet to read it.   When I'm Thinking About You    Over the rooftops, a plane in the sky, beat of a bass drum, cars passing me by.  Under a bridge dark then back into light, a river of raincoats and a forest of faces.  Still for a moment then red into green, slow shuffling shoes whisper sight unseen.  Row upon row of houses return an empty stare, let me daydream for a little while longer.  Ah, hope I’ll never wake when I’m thinking about you. Yeah, hope I’ll never wake cause now I’m thinking about you.  Two-minute hailstorm then melts into rain, oh, sing me a rainbow, it’s sunny again. Swallows overhead while the traffic snarls below, could I, could I, keep dreaming for a little while longer? Ah, hope I’ll never wake when I’m thinking about you. So that you know, I never want to wake cause now I’m thinking about you.  When you’re searching your soul, when you’re searching for pleasure, how often, pain is all you find. But when you’re coasting along and nobody’s trying too hard, you can turn around and like where you are.   Yeah, and I hope I never wake when I’m thinking about you. And I close my eyes, dear, now I’ll never, never wake, why should I stop thinking about you?

      Legolas texted yesterday and I told him his officemates were here. Inis daw sya why he wasn't asked to come over here too, he should've seen me daw. I joked that I thought he was coming and I'm about to show him my boyfriend. "Bf mo na si kilay boy?!" I just replied with a smile and he didn't answer back. I wonder how he feels. He didn't joke about it. Does he regret not making any moves during those 2 months that we spent chatting online? I've got the eyebags to prove it. Well I can't wait much longer. He doesn't even express what he really wants from me so I just assumed all he wanted was friendship, someone to joke around with in Yahoo. Well too bad for him. Serves him right for making everything a joke.

      He has asked me to go with him to mass after work tonight. I haven't told my mom yet but I hope it's okay with her. Will we be praying for the same thing? I suddenly remembered the time he took me to this waterfall along Roxas Blvd and gave me a coin for me to wish. He took another coin and wished himself. I wonder if we wished for the same thing. Last night I asked him to stop because I'll be having a hard time if I started getting used to it and he'll eventually leave. He asked why. I told him I'm not used to these things at all. He just said I better get used to it, and he called me "baby". He even said "Bat naman ako mawawala, ngayon pa." I wonder what he meant by that, he wouldn't say. *sigh* Before he left I went to his workstation and he showed me pictures. He was really overweight back then! But still cute. I was kind of embarrassed to be seen in a room with just him, considering it was a bit late and it might seem I was making the moves. I think only a handful knows that anything is going on between us. Yesterday morning I gave him a copy of my Inquirer essay and I even joked that he could throw the paper after reading it. He said he'd frame it. What he remembered most was me wanting to get married between 25 and 27. I was a little embarrassed sharing it with him but it was a way for him to get to know me better. He'll show it daw to someone else. Gosh I wonder who. It was very sweet of him to actually wrap my books in plastic. And he almost gave me the stuffed toy he got from his friend. He even gave me food yesterday. He said he'll be giving me something today. I wonder what it is. He asked me if I feel something for him, but I could choose not to answer. I just told him it was too early for me to say anything at this point, but I told him that I feel happy everytime we're together because he takes care of me, he makes me laugh and he makes me feel special all the time. He replied by saying that he's very happy with everything that's happening and we'll talk daw later. He kids around that he can't wait to kiss me. Told him I wouldn't allow it. Gosh if he only knew how much I wanted it! But of course I have to control for now. That's the only thing I could do. I hope I could stop myself from admitting to him that I had been noticing him since last year.

      Hands down this is the best feeling ever... I think I'm falling... hard. Fara says I should just make sure that somebody is ready to catch me when I do. Is he ready? I got home around 3am again last Saturday, my head up in the clouds as always. Is this for real? Seems too good to be true, too good to last. I do hope it does. It's alarming that I think I'm getting used to him texting, him taking me to the gym and picking me up afterwards and bringing me home. What if he stops altogether? :( He hasn't even managed to meet my parents, much more my friends who are all looking forward to meeting him. It's weird now that he has exposed his feelings for me, the fear of it changing overnight bothers me so much. Is this how it really is? I hope that before it's too late I wake up from this dream.

      What do you say when someone stares at you for long periods of time and tells you he's just memorizing every line, every contour of your face just so he can conjure a mental picture of you everytime he feels sad or everytime he doesn't see you? Nothing. You could only stare back and perhaps smile a little, and pray to all the saints that moment may never end. It's just overwhelming when a person that you really like tells you that he's very happy being with you and how much control he has to muster to keep himself from hugging and kissing you.

      "You've already won me over in spite of me, now don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet..." I just had to add that to the growing list of songs to put on this CD. It's been barely a month and I'm already planning how to go about the time when the question pops up. I know I'm getting so ahead of myself here but I can't help it! I swear I have never felt anything like this before and it takes a lot of control on my part not to give in this easy. The question is, how can you not?! He's a heartthrob to begin with, and the more I get to know him, the more I find that he's unbelievably a good catch. He was close to his grandma, he's close to his family, he likes kids, he took me to Italianni's even if he was on a limited budget, he's planning to sign up at the gym with me (again on a limited budget), he took me home in a trike, he wants to meet my parents, he wants me to meet his family... what more can you ask for?!

       For the past few weeks I have been walking around with dark circles under my eyes. Even if I don't go online as often as I used to like in the last 2 months, I look like I have been stressing myself out at work or with something else. It's more of something else :P It's not actually stress because admittedly it is self-induced and I do get a kick out of it everytime hahaha!  It's pretty amazing that things have finally taken a sudden positive turn as I reached my 24th year. It used to be having countless heart-to-heart talks with girlfriends about the same old topic be it through text, chat or over coffee or dinner. It used to be that I easily get tired of doing the same thing over and over. Like the mother-daughter tandem in Chocolat, the "northern wind" seems to take me someplace else after I feel that my time is up. I think it helped when I started thinking positively, but of course I never knew that it would turn out to be this good.  Work could only get better even if there are times I'm still at a loss over several things since it looks like I have to start learning anew. Friends I've made a lot, and it's nice knowing that some of the old ones actually see me as the trustworthy kind, someone for keeps. This is where I find that intergender relationships can actually be purely platonic. It's fun when you spend time with them and actually learn from their experiences in this department where I'm still a rookie.  Then there's him. Like Selena once said "and I still can't believe that you came up to me and said 'I love you'." There has been no mention of that YET, though, but of course anyone in my place could feel it coming. It's just amazing that I have noticed him way back in December (or even before I came here) but didn't actually think about it since I knew he had to be attached, for that kind of face could never be available for the taking. I never knew his name until a few months ago when I would see him regularly, but again didn't think much about it since my mind was preoccupied by someone else.  And then I completely forgot about him when I was introduced to Legolas. It was a chance meeting that ended up in late night yahoo messaging that lasted for more than 2 months. Now I only get online at home once a week but we still text. Or he still texts. Does he miss me? The one question that still lingers in my mind is if he regrets not making a move during that time. Now he knows that there's someone else.  And then there's Edmund Dantes. Sorry can't think of any code name for now. But he is currently turning my life around. No one has ever been more thoughtful and caring and patient with me. This has got to be it.

      It's the first time we met in the corridor after what happened. I was talking to someone and when I looked up he was looking at me, and I nodded in acknowledgement. Or did I smile at him? I don't remember. I think he just managed a quick smile or just nodded in acknowledgment. It's a good thing he doesn't seem embarrassed now. Well he shouldn't be. After all, I don't. I went in and out of their room several times yesterday and I felt he was trying to avoid me. He couldn't even look at my friends straight in the eye. Is he guilty of something? Haha. Doesn't matter now. It's over and we should get on with each other's lives.

       I'd like to think what I did last Sunday would bring me peace of mind. I don't harbor resentment no longer but I guess it would take me a while to get back to normal. Things like this aren't easy.   I texted him to say I got upset with him but I finally realized that this has to happen. I respect his decision and I don't want to prevent him from fulfilling his dreams. I also told him that I knew he has always been sincere and I'm ok with the setup of us being just friends. He thanked me for understanding and it was good that he apologized for even starting, and it's good that we have ironed out things now before this relationship reached a deeper level. I told him I shouldn't have had any expectations but I thanked him for what has been. He said it wasn't because he didn't like it but it just wasn't the right time. He'll still be here if I need him and I found it to be a comforting thought.   Deep in my heart this is not just a fling even if it looked like one. It felt so real for me and I'm pretty sure he feels the same way. I think I'm the only one who could say how special July 2004 was to me because I met someone who made me feel really special and this is the first time I ever felt strongly towards anyone. It's just sad that things didn't turn out the way I had hoped, but nevertheless it is an experience I would never ever forget.    It's good that it has happened this early, because if it went on longer, it will be harder for us to part ways, and this is knowing that sooner or later he will have to leave and work elsewhere. He might even blame me for preventing him from doing what he wants and I might blame him that he can't keep up with my expectations. I guess this is a blessing in disguise. It might be hard at first but I'll get over it eventually.
