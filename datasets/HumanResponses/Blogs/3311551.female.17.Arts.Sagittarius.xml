      I dedicate this update to a dear friend of mine whom I last seen his smile on 8th February, 2003. His name is Chong Csen Dik... and are known to us as Aki Riku.  	The eldest son in the whole family, he was a perfect senior to fool with everyday after school. Basically, you won't find him in class most of the time. He's another one of those naughty and black-listed students that most teachers won't want to handle. I knew him through his sister, Aki Reiko. Reiko was my best friend since the first day I entered junior high. She was the one who introduced me to the Chinese society in this new environment of mine in which, I thought would suck. Ah, well... for a NAO girl like me, it doesn't matter.   	I still remember that every afternoon after school, Reiko and I will walk home, discussing and sharing what had happened on that day since I'm in a different class. And there goes Riku-sempai riding his BMX, snatching my books or my bag away from me with a bunch of his friends.  	 	He's a playful chap from day one. For several times since the first time I have been introduced to him, he had been playfully serious, saying "be my girlfriend,". And I would throw him the rolling eyes frown and says that he's crazy. Reiko would often say, he's mad and he's a total pain in the ass... and truthfully, I missed those days. I missed his loud mouth, his spirit and his smile. I missed him.  	The last time I seen him was on a Friday afternoon, 8th February, 2003. He was driving his red Kancil and passed us with a cute smile, waving. He had already graduated that time. He left his hair to grow long and dyed it in shades of brown and blonde. He looks totally cute that time and that was one smile in which will be remembered forever. Ryujin, Hyuzu and me was in my otousan's car. Ryusuke was driving.  	Two days after, a Sunday... on 10th February, Ryusuke had just came home from his girlfriends' house. His face was pretty pale. But, he came home with a 'tadaima' and still manage to check wether I had known about the news or not. I was totally clueless, ironing my school uniform, getting all ready for the big, hectic Monday. He walked towards the PC and stopped the songs that I listed to play. Ryusuke walked into the dry kitchen and confronted me.   	"Did you hear about it yet...? Riku... had passed away... in an accident," he slowly told me.  	I stared at him, strange. "Life and death is not a joke, you moron..." I snapped at him, still thinking he was joking. "I'm not... joking. There was 6 person in the car. Two passed away this evening, in the hospital... one of them, was Riku...," he pulled out a chair and sat on the mozaic dining table. I remained in silence. Halted. To me, all that were plain lies. Some absurd joke. "They're still in critical condition," he just stared the kitchen floor. I stopped doing what I was doing earlier and headed to call Hyuzu... in hopes, she might have known more than what I had heard from my brother.   	I told Hyuzu everything and she too thought I was out of my mind. Hyuzu was very sceptical. She chose to wait for a bigger announcement. I then called Niji. Niji filled me in about the accident and said she had also heard that Riku-sempai had passed away. And all of a sudden, Yakumo appeared in my mind. Niji said that the number of confirmed people involved in that accident was 6 but, has yet to know who the other 5 were. Dead concerned, I soon found out that Yakumo had rejected the bunch's offer to go to Genting Highlands that night.   	It was a gloomy Monday morning. Yumi was the first I met and she had already received the news on Sunday, first thing in the morning. She was all quiet. All the Chinese girls and guys were silent. All, waiting for the moment of truth, for news to be announced by the headmistress. I was alright. In fact, I did not shed a tear since I heard the news. I couldn't cry... but, I remember, I couldn't bear to keep it anymore when the whole school gasped in a grave surprise upon the announcement.  	"I believe in what I could do. Now, if you just let me do it, one last time..." Riku's words of rang in my head brings me back...  	The training sessions of 2002's Sports Day has begun and that was when we got a news that Riku-sempai has a motorcycle accident and he sprained his ankles so badly, he could not walk for almost a week. When he has done resting, he quickly came back for track and field trainings. He was one of the best Chinese sprinters in our school and one of the best in Green House, in which, I too was a committee. I became his personal 'manager' and Yumi was the 'nurse'... we would tag along with him in any event. I remembered there was once... on a training day in which Yumi and I were both not needed to attend... I still make it an effort to go to the school field to check Riku-sempai's condition. After that day, the guys actually spread rumours about me being his girlfriend since I'm attending every one of his training(which is a must since I am one of the Green House's sprinters and one of the First Aid Team members) and took care of him.  	"He isn't doing very good. He should stop," one of the lady teachers told me. "Doctors said if he goes on doing it, he'll not be able to run for his whole life," Yumi looked at me, pale. Riku-sempai was still adjusting the bandages and all on the starting line where the other track runners and coach gets ready. Yumi pulled me to go advise him to stop. He didn't listen and told us that he's alright. It isn't our league to stop him. Both me and Yumi are just his normal juniors that he meets once in a while...  	During the final trainings, I met him in the canteen and he was sitting on the bench, changing his shoes and getting ready to go... I approached him. Surprisingly, my heart was not in storm. I sat beside him and asked him not to run. He smiled at me and asked why was I so worried. "You're our hope for Green House to win this year... don't go on. You might hurt yourself today," with a light tug on his sleeves(I never done something this daring before, really!). He left with an 'I'll be alright,'.  	 	As what I had feared, he made the wrong move and stumbled. I quickly ran to his aid as he crawled to the side of the track, without wanting to be in other runners' way. He moaned in pain but, I couldn't do anything but to call for the teachers and senior medics to help me aid him. He was carried in, to where he could rest and go see the doctor after that.   	On the big day, even though the Green House's coach had warned him not to enter the tracks, he approached. There wasn't enough runners to cover the list. Riku-sempai sent himself to the track. "It was my dream... my dream to be Malaysia's proud sprinter... but, I know, I can't. This is my final year here. If I don't get selected this time, I'll never get in..." he looked far out to the finishing line. "I want to run for my dreams... I want to run for my country... I want to run for this school," he left.   	I was being called in to get ready for the 4X100meters run and as I walked towards the Green House's camp, I heard friends screaming 'don't go on!' and look backwards. Riku-sempai was fumbling in his steps and struggled to stay on his feets but, crashed instead. He was the leading one out of the 6 runners but, his fall has failed him. However, he did not lost in that race... he was the winner in everyone of the Green House's committees and coach's heart.   	Til today... I have never been able to summon the courage to ask Reiko about the location of Riku-sempai's altar in the temple... Reiko and I had grown apart since year 2000 because we both have seperate lives then. We did remained good friends though. And I had never ask about how she was since the day I had heard about the accident...  	"What the heck are you doing to your lab reports! What are these sea horses and clown fishes doin here?!" Kouri, Reiko's best friend asked her at the assembly one day. "This two clown fishes... my dearest Miyazaki-kun and myself... the other one here is my brother...!" she continued with a big smile and the sweet grin on her fair and rosy complexion. I, who was listening by the side was so touched by her courage and will power to leave the past frames and move on.  	It's true that no one cold turn back time and no one could bring back the dead. It's just comforting enough to know that, even though he's not visible anymore,  Riku-sempai's spirit forever lingers in the hearts of every single person who had knew him. And he thought me some of the most important lessons in life... and now, he's still teaching me. Teaching me how to appreciate life. Teaching me that even though his light has been dimmed, the others must still shine and go on living. Teaching me to tell how important someone is to me.   	If only I had learnt to tell you how important you are to me; If only... I had learnt to appreciate you before this.  -----------------------------------------------------Das Ende----------  Well... heh... I guess this is the first time I'm writing a Heart Chapter for my journal. I'm not very good as expressing what I think and feel through words but, I think I could write better than I speak. So, this is just the brief experience of life's most bitter moments so far.   I just remembered about him so... =3 Thanks for reading.   The Cerulean Sky, ~Ciel~

XD It was great kicking butt with you all~! XD  Eto... oI still don't understand why Dynasty wanted to let go of SVanhilt... *sigh* and I miss 4pa` and The|Ant so much. X  And since Mummy Kyoka is going to the cyber cafe to play RO now, Daddy KenKen had been helping her to change password... but, in all that good-willed attempts, there was once he had changed and forgotten bout the password. LOL~!!! My God... I think he's getting old... XP All that and he calls me 'bakka'... *rofl~*!  Sigh... today still got so many things to do nia. I've been so lazy for too long already. Was supposed to rush my works for Team BEAN and I only know how lay around complaining about the weather. Really... the weather these days are killin me(I believe others as well, no?). Eto... and I realize that my bathroom... which normally is all drenched with moisture are so dry and nice these days. @_@ The bad thing is... I can't have enough sleep. >_  New items I bought lately(this month): >NewType May >Animage May >Chrno Crusade Vol. 2 by Daisuke Moriyama >Hagaren Vol. 7 by Hiromu Arakawa >Hagaren VCDs Ep. 5-8  >Basketball Graffiti by Aoyagi Takao(whole set!!! 7 Vols) >R2[Rise R to the Second Power] Vol. 2 by Maki Hakoda >Valkyrie Profile Vol. 2 by Yuu Hijikata >Firstking Adventure Vol. 1-4 by Moyamu Fujino >Desert Coral Vol. 1 by Wataru Moriyama *IMO, the artworks are... not up to my expectations, really!* >Brave Story Vol. 1 by Yoichirou Ono >TSUBASA RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE Vol. 6 by CLAMP >Ah! My Goddess Vol. 29 by Kohsuke Fujishima *for Rugal@White_Fox T_T* >Hikaru no Go Special Edition VCD  Now... if you could help me calculate how much they are worth... and do remind me I'm splashing too much money... @_@;; I've been really draining my family's resources since I'm still gobbling sour grapes(mengganggur/jobless). ^^;; Oh anyway, my class doesn't begin til next year... so, what the heck. But, I really should cut down my visits to Kinokuniya that often... I've been going back and forth to Kinokuniya for like 5-6 times within two weeks~! @_@   The list of people I wanna kill now: the HSBC accountants... *smacks, pokes, bash, push, slash, hack, thrust, kicks, punch, pinch, steps, chokes, whip, zap*... @@ I've been trying to get through with my Internet Registration for more than a month now and still, nothing has been done, instead, they like calling me to the HQ to get new tag number for the idenfication term. @_@ DAMMIT... maybe that's the reason why I have been going to Kinokuniya that often, no...? Blame them...  BTW, I saw RO Official Fanworks Collection retailing at around RM120+... Hmmph... if anyone had seen it already... and have bought it, I'd love to know the contents... coz, since they were fanworks... I'm pretty reluctant to purchase... Anyone who had seen Moriyama Daisuke's collection, PLEASE inform me~! XD And of yeah... Chrono Cross' A View of the World:A Missing Piece. PLEASE, PLEASE... inform me... please do~! XD  Had been stuck into drawing RO characters these days... and the doujin's I was supposed to complete(Bing-Bing RO!, Sai no Go and Hagaren Doujinshi) are still delayed at hand... @_@ Also planning to do one on Chrno Crusade since now, my team of doujinka/mangaka is having meetings weekly... Heh... meetings doesn't mean everything would be done. @_@ It's scary how we actually laugh the time away. When I sit down with Yumi-chan and Hyu-chan, sure we'd talk the strangest thing in the world and laugh the heck outta it.   Hmmph... That reminds me. Drawing RO characters... I've also been drawing lotsa RO persona's lately. ESP the guys... ^^; I was waiting for Hyu-chan and Satou-kun at KLSentral's McD's while drawing a group of 9 guys(the A4 paper only could fit 9 guys...@_@); consists of Croixe(Delacroixe), Love(4pa`), Shindai(~Lysander~), Haru(Nightblade), Az(-[+_-]-), Rezen/Adi-san(Corrupted Monk), Leo(Sloopy), Sena(RingBearer) and Bryan(Baby Vinz). In the process of concentrating on the sketch, an English man who was supposed to be a traveller/tourist was actually looking at me from the table next to me and I didn't even notice him looking. When he finally finished his breakfast and stood up to walk away, I paused a while to think of what else to add and he approached me. "Did you draw all that?" he looked at me with those sparkling eyes and I nodded with a yes. "That's amazing. They were really nice!" he went. =^^= That's one heck of a surprise... I did manage to thank him while I was busy blushing. LOL~! But... after he left... I just said 'yare'... and continued waiting for Hyu and Satou who's like 2 hours late! @@*   I know I'm pretty much a guy crazy girl... but, I remembered that DM-sama(DMJewelle) said that I'm actually a guy! @@ LOL~! Just yesterday night in #comicfiesta when I was chatting with Rugal-san(White_Fox or the Hentai-Otaku ^^;), DM-sama and JinJin, DM-sama actually told me that I sounded more like a guy coz I didn't like yaoi, I didn't like CLAMP, I didn't like bishies... @_@ Does that all fill up the terms and condition of becoming a guy? WOW~ But, heck... was a lil proud of being a lad. LOL~! Don't know why... but, if I do sound like a guy to anyone at all, I'd be perfectly comfortable if you had told me so. LOL~! I'm too addicted to being a guy after my RO experience. LOL~! Even though they said being a girl is way more easier in cheating the guys. XP  I remember reading back Aria-chan's letter and she told me that my Sin looks like the young Battousai Himura. XD WOO HOO~! Now, that's something to stuff into Hyu and Satou's face about. That's if I dyed my Sin's hair red! XP And yes... my Sin is a male. XP Anyone reading this... who's in Loki server, please contact CielElric every Wednesday and Saturday after 5PM. XP And if DM-sama is reading this... don't get me wrong, k? I AM a girl... I just have a male Sin in my male account I created using a friends' data... LOL~! I didn't know it'll effect the appearance at first... XP  OH.. 19th May, 2004.. Dynasty didn't go for War so, they went MVP hunting. LOL~! It caused a huge headache to most of them who participated. ^^;; So, I planned to back out. Since I've been dead for like a few times during that period of MVP hunting. The first was of course High Orc coz Dynasty was attacking Konoha Devilz(I think) in Geffen. Then, we moved to hunt Osiris... @_@ I died instantly. LOL~! And then we headed to kick Dopplegangers' ass. Another Guild's lvl 99 Hunter MVP'd it... since there was a Knight who was doing the tanking(Knight formerly Dynasty Guilds man). *sigh* That's when I planned to escape the huge torture. =_= Priests won't get exp, so why don't I go GH and train with Hyu and Satou instead...? Heh...  The quest was fun in Glast Heim's Abbey. XD I still remember Hyu-chan's new Priestess Wolfinus Valkyrie screaming 'Run!' when she saw a Joker spawning next to Satou's new Hunter, azuran. XD Heh... and me and JinJin's Chrno-Crusade- actually nailed it with an 'AMEN'. It was so fun that now there's nothing against us anymore. =P Before this, entering Glast Heim only meant death... not anymore now. XD And I've also drew a few pix that I'd be posting to CF forum. ^^ Hopefully, it'll be soon... @_@ Still have not got the will to walk out there to scan those piccies... LAZY~!(that's why I'm gaining weight!)  *sigh*... since I'm editing this piece to both LiveJournal.com and here... I might as well touch on the topic that... YES~! I'm being lazy again. And I can't wait to welcome my couzy, MATT, home again. I wish he was here but, heck he's more busy than I am. XP So, hope he'll be able to attend Bon Odori... ^^  Bon Odori... @_@ Now, I'm wondering how will this year's Bon Odori be. Since I remembered the last one(2003) was kinda tragic... XP I went there with 5 of my best pals back in school days(not that they aren't anymore my pals... but, since the guys have all left town for their own route, I consider them my school days' pals...heh!). Hyu-chan, Yumi-chan, Katsukawa-kun a.k.a. Kasut, Togemori-kun and the baka 'bubu chitchit' Ryujin-kun. XP The guys were all drunk at the end of the event... ^^; Coz they were drinking beer. They just can't resist the 'buy 3 free 1' poster at that specific stall that sells liqour. LOL~! They gulped down the cans of beer while we girls watch the cute Japanese chaps play the drums... ^^ And in the end, we noticed we were late to catch the train back to Rawang... @_@ And we spent almost 3 hours stranded in KLSentral... We were even playing and joking with the guards there(the guys were drunk!). Not to mention, the funniest part was in the KTM from Shah Alam to KLSentral... XD The guys actually almost performed a strip dance in the train with everyone watching! @_@   No more drunk chaps and strip dance in train anymore this year... all gone... T_T Kinda missed those days back in school. It's true now that most of my seniors tells me to cherish the days I have in school... Now that the time has passed, I couldn't meet the folks nemore... ='  Huh... I've been sitting on the same chair from 11PM and now it's already 8AM in the morning. @_@ My nocturnal syndrom is getting onto me again... BAD~! >_ _  I promise to have two different versions of updates for my LJ and blog... ^^; For now, I'd better go reply Aria-chan's mail and also xiongie-kun's e-mail that I had been delaying for more than a week already. T_T To end this blog/journal... I think fans of Digimon/D.N.Angel should really get Firstking Adventure... XP Hehehe... Nice works of monsters and cute cute kids... XD  TQ's and credits to you who's readin. XD TioZ(tiru MATT... hahaha!)  ~Ciel~ LJ>>www.livejournal.com/cielelric Friendster>>Ciel Elric

      My first step into the bloggin world. Haven't been active in the Net for so long... haven't even updated my Live Journal page yet and I'm jumping into this new bloggie already. *sigh*  Ara... anyway... RWC is so near. Haven't been training much at all. But heard news from Daddy KenKen that Dynasty is having an early pension. THe|Ant, 4pa`, THe|Kenishi4 will be quitting. And that reminds me, I've been missing my old buddies @nson, -Bell-, Nightblade, ~Lysander~ and Sloopy. It's such a lonely world out there when you play RO without your very best friends.  Couldn't wait for Bon Odori to come. XD It's about a month away from now...   Haven't finish my works for Comic Fiesta yet!!! XD And Wolfinus is getting so hyper about making plans to meet Sakura and Hide. She 'missed' them so much she shouted and squeeled at the phone while talking to me a few hours back.   Owh... it's startin to rain... *piff*  My first step into bloggin world ain't that bad after all. =P
