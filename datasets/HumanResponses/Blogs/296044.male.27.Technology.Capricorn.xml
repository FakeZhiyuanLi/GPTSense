      "I guess I must have messed it up, when I gave you the lady shave."  I saw this woman standing in our lobby just now.  Tall, long legs, wearing all black.  She had this older, mature look to her.  She was calling someone on her cell phone.  She had this look on her like it was the last thing she had to do before she got out of here.  Then she could call it a day...  Staring off into the distance past the front desk at some goal she could see on the horizon of her mind.  As I walked down the stairs toward her direction it occured to me that she deserves to call it a day.  She has this stature about her that makes you know she's worked hard for this company, and she knows it.  I don't get this just from looking at her, I've also worked with her.  But when I worked with her, she was sitting behind a desk, and I didn't get to see the confidence she inspires while standing, waiting to leave, making a phone call.  I don't think I payed that much attention to her looks until today, when I saw how she was stunningly different than the rest of the people in the lobby, doing thier end of day chores.

      "He taught her how to... run baby, run baby, run..."  How come when I think of that line I smile?  I stopped the other day while waiting in line in our Cafe, and thought of that and just smiled.  For some reason it brings me comfort.  Maybe cause I know if things get really bad, I'll always have somewhere to run to?  Maybe cause sometimes we all run from something?

      I wanted to make the shadows the common theme I thought the barbells would look like they were an invention from the future So I made them look warped and an odd color for barbells When I hear that sound I imagine the future.  Well, my future to be exact. I think about the dance floors all around the world. I think about all the young boys dancing, tripping to the dense beat of music. I think about the DJ’s and imagine them looking out onto the floor as they spin the music. All the kids moving in slow motion, the lights streaming back and forth across their faces. Faces lost in another world, eyes closed imagining the music… seeing it.  They can see it you know. I could see it when I danced. When that perfect song came on, I’d close my eyes, and I’d be there, with the music around me. I’d push harder and harder, I’d feel it, see it, and move to it. I was in love with the music. Drum & Bass, Trance, House, Jungle… I felt it all.  It pumped through my body like waves across the sand. I felt alive, I felt more real than I had ever before. I’d open my eyes and look around at all the beautiful people. What were they thinking? Did they feel the music like me? Yes they did.  I could see it in their face.   They were lost in the same land I was. I always went to a place that seemed religious. People on pedestals dancing to the music I heard. I could see myself walking through arch ways, and down, great halls. I’d finally reach a huge enclosed courtyard. There, I’d find all the people on the dance floor, moving, pumping, all in their own light. Beautiful light surrounded us, flashing, glowing, and dancing to the beat just like us. It seemed like a temple. And you knew they did this all the time, you’d come to dance, and leave to sleep. When you woke up, you’d just dance again. Every once in a while we’d take breaks, to talk to friends, gossip a bit, and discuss the song we liked most. Then back to the floor. Slowly the music would come back on, just like a hymn during church. They’d gather together on the floor, slowly coming back to life, waiting for the beat to break in. Then pounding the floor again, to make a commotion, to press them into another world. You can do that if you dance hard enough. You leave this world and go away on some trip floating along, with images and sound as your guide. It’s the most beautiful place I’ve ever been to. I’ll never stop dancing.

      Josh and I played Gran Tourismo 3 last night.  He played for about four hours straight... I got there later, so I only played for two and a half; straight.  Dman that's a fun game.  Make yo feet stank!  I cancelled my subscription to Majestic.  Just wasn't getting much out of it.  I thought it was beginning to get a little cheesy.  Mike, Kendra, Shintaro, I hope you're all found safe and sound, and someone figures out what maniacle shadow government destroyed your software company.  I made a CD of "Commercial Music" yesterday.  If you'd like a copy email me at work.  I plan on making a disc two sometime soon too.  Aaron, send me your damn resume.  Until tomorrow...

      I feel like I should be posting to this thing everyday, like it's my diary or something.  Maybe Freud would say this is a good way to improve your psychological well being.  Ahhh, I feel sooo much better.  Ahh...  That's onomatopoeia?  Went to Tuttle Mall yesterday with Sue, Josh, and Hanz.  I don't know how to spell Hanz.  Oh well, I'll ask Susan later.  Got some new clothes at the swank new, Express for Men, Incorporating Structure...  Ugh, poor Structure.  It's kind of like how DJ Rob Engel has to play at liberties now...  So sad.  But there did seem to be a lot more people in there than normal.  I bought a book on Worst Case Scenarios.  I like the way it's setup... kind of reminds me of my Boy Scout manual when I was a kid.  Except each book seems to be one of two extremes, either too benign or too amazingly daring.  The Worst Case book would be the latter.  I don't have much else to say about yesterday.  Eric is like 95% moved in now.  Jeremy is still missing his cell phone.  Tani doesn't have much left in our apt anymore.  Rocko still lives with us.  Danielle was partying at some drug infested rave at a house two doors down from me yesterday.  That bothered me a lot.  Later.

      Just set up this Blog thing... seems cool, but cheesy dumb at the same time.  I just got back from Dick's Den about an hour ago.  Very interesting night.  Listened to this group of guys from somewhere in Columbus called the "Bog".  I've heard of the "Bog" before, but I never knew exactly what it was or who lived there.  Apparently a group of spoken word types live there.  Hep cats.  Good jazz tonight.  Really something I needed and was into.  Now I'm sitting here in front of my computer listening to my loung and jazz mp3's gettin ready to go to bed.  Yeah, I meant to spell gettin that way.  No g for me.  Too cool for school.  Know what I mean, daddy-o?  Night.  Peace.  Out.  Yo.

      Issues.  I had issues yesterday with a video capture card I bought.  I don't feel like going into it.  I returned it and bought a capture card from a more reputable source.  I have a feeling it won't work either.  You get what you wish for?  Pay for...  Issues.  I need a boyfriend.  Issues.  What's this?  I have nothing planned for this weekend?  How did that happen?  No Coca-Cola.  Issues.  "Don't say you want me.  Don't say you need me.  Don't say you love me.  It's understood.  Don't say you're happy,  Out there without me,  I know you can't be."  -DM

      Ok, I taked to Tani yesterday, and she was concerned that I hadn't updated "Me" in a while.  Tani noticed over the weekend I seemed to be more "in the clouds" than usual.  I think she was right... it kind of botheremed me though, cause at the time she told me (yesterday around 7 pm) I was really tired after having been up since 6 am, and working a hard day of trying to fight off viruses and running around, and so I was concerened, but too tired to be concerned, which concerened me even more.  You know?  Yeah.  Anyway, I chalk it up to my two day abstinence from my daily vitamins and ginsing.  (I have no idea if that's how you spell ginsing)  I'm not all that worried about it today.  Although I did get up at 6 am again, and started plowing through computer problems as soon as I got here, so I'm already pretty tired.  Ok, phrase for today is om-mani-padme-hum.  --Buddhist mantra.  Means pearl of the lotus.  It has a deeper meaning than that actually, but it's involved and I don't have enough time or space to go into it.  Anyway, repeating that phrase during medidation helps you to concentrate, clear your mind, and become closer to nothingness.  Try it.  This is Kris Burns' last week here.  I'll miss him.  Last thought of the day:  Fair food.  Discuss.

      Boy do I have a headache today.  Not sure why.  I'm tired too.  Probably because someone I live with came home at 3 am.  Gee, I've never done anything like that to anyone before...  I've been in a somewhat melancholy mood lately.  I'm restless, and not sure what I need to get me out of it.  My roommate Eric and I saw some great paintings in a gallery on High St. the other night.  I wish I had enough money to buy them, that might satisfy something I'm looking for right now.  Is the Fair over yet?  I wanted to go again this year, but no one seemed to be interested, and I didn't really motivate myself...  I wanted to be with the commoners!  My computer has crashed at home.  No artistic creativity for a while.  Should I turn to pencil and paper?  Can I draw?  "This must be the place I've waited years to leave." - PSB  There's this guy I work with, and I hate his fucking laugh.  He laughs at the dumbest stuff.  Freak.  He's laughing right now.  I'm gonna burn down the building.

      Ahh.  Things are looking better.  My roommates made up.  Jeremy told Rich to get out last night.  By Wednesday.  If he doesn't, I'll poke his eyes out.  Rich's.  Possibly Jeremy's too.  I have a date tonight.  I'm going out with John and friends Saturday, and then GATECRASHER!  Susan is meeting me for lunch today.  I need to clean Tani's carpet!!!  Pick rollers cost $119 and a pad assembly costs $30.  Can the company spend the money?  Stay tuned...

      Post mortem desires to be withdrawn.

      Hopefully I can buy the parts for my new computer this weekend.  I received my Dell Certified Technician certificates today.  Woo hoo.  I have hung up my Link To Success plaq.  How do you spell plaq?  Bought the re-released version of Introspective.  It's nice to visit the old PSB stuff.  And oh, yes, we were able to afford Pick Rolles and an Assembly Pad.  Phew... I knew you were worried.  Going to go home in 15 mins.  Let the bike riding commence...

      Have you let them win?  Are you worried that the next time you walk out your door you might have to hold your breath for fear of Anthrax being in the air? Does the idea of a shadowy mushroom cloud on the horizon seem not so odd? That dark looking gentleman that passed you on the street, did you second guess his intentions? The plane that just flew by, do you wonder where EXACTLY it's going?  Don't.  Live life globally, but don't repress your freedoms.  Do what you can to understand what goes on outside the borders of this country.  The more we understand our world, the more we can keep this from becoming an end to the peace we cherish.  The whole world should enjoy what we STILL have.

      I used to tell people that I was part of Generation D.  Generation Digital.  I'm not a Gen Xer; I missed that classification by a year or two.  (Although, I can slack with the best of them.)  But from a chronological point of view, and because of my career path, I can be described as nothing but part of Generation D.  Or, at least, used to be.  As part of that phenominal generation, I had the luxury of being part of a class of young hipsters that were caught somewhere between yuppy and hippie.  We have the smarts to know what the difference between TCP/IP and Voice over IP is, the style to know that the seventies are in, and the nineties are out, and the foolishness to forget to balance our checkbook.  More importantly, these things were all we had to know.  My freedom, the integrity of my country; taken for granted in a world where peace was no longer dictated by a hand gesture, it was dictated by leaders and whole continents.  Our world was one in which we had little doubt that all was going well, and all would continue to go well.  Now, we weren't oblivious to the strains of world peace being felt in such places as Northern Ireland, or the Palestine, but those (so we thought) would eventual be ironed out by liberally minded leaders who were beginning to see the light.  Or so we thought.  My generation, not only of my fellow D'ers, but those of Generation X, and Y, and all of us who were lulled into thinking peace and freedom would be in everyone's backyard someday, have been relegated to anger, hatred, disgust, dismay, and trepidation.  We are Generation 9-11.  We have lost the blind (but needed) faith of a belief in freedom for all.  We have lost an innocence that no generation has seen in over half a century.  And our generation will give way to one that most likely will share the same sense of despair and frustration that we have suffered.  We are not so much afraid of what will happen in the future, but so saddended that all we had expected and hoped for has been obliterated by the idotic actions of a small group of barbarians.  How dare they dictate what we in the civilized world have worked so hard to build.  And how dare they dash our hopes so quickly.  You might ask, if we of this generation of hopefuls are so enlighted, then how is it that our optimism is so easily withdrawn.  I don't know.  I think, because this is not something that is easily rebuilt, just as the War Against Terrorism is not easily won.  Our faith is not easily restored, because we are human.  When your parents fail you; the ones you trust so much, do you easily forget?  To regain the peace and hopefulness we had for our world, we must see that these things can be controlled and put aside.  But how do you control terrorism?  How do you forget that somewhere along the line, we had left something out of the equation.  In the 1930's the major powers of the Earth were writing and signing peace treaties and creating delegations for the promotion of peaceful resolutions like it was going out of style.  (Go ahead, check your encyclopaedia)  But, alas, we all know what happend in the late 30's.  So here now, we have this conundrum.  And now our generation will be the ones to figure it out.  And our generation will have to learn to live with this new reality; that in a world so close to peace, there is always room for war.  We will have to find out how to better keep our distance from that possibility.  Or maybe the answer is to learn how to keep the faith, so next time, we're not caught off gaurd.  So someday there will be a Generation Peace.

      All good things...  Get your own enemies.  I have this recurring image in my head of walking down one of the hallways here at work. As I pass a corridor on my right a woman I know is talking to one of her co-workers about something work related.  She smiles at me as I pass and continues to talk to her co-worker.  She is wearing a yellow shirt.  Pale yellow.  It reminds me of Easter.  I keep walking.  After another ten feet the same woman appears again, standing in the same position, as if she's talking to her co-worker still.  But he's not there.  As I approach her I don't turn my head, I don't want to look at her... it doesn't make sense to me that she could be in the hallway twice at practically the same time.  Out of the corner of my head as I pass she turns and begins to smile, but her face distorts and becomes grey and grotesque.  She grins, but it turns devilish.  The image fades.  The Rain Falls and the Sky Shudders.

      Not in the best of moods today.  I constantly find myself pissed off at people who are unable to control thier mouths.  This project manager walks in here and starts spewing about what he thinks about the latest news on the sniper.  I don't care.  But apparently he thinks the three guys currently sitting here are thrilled to here his mindless banter.  Yeah, yeah, I'm doing the same thing right now.  But I didn't force it on you.  You clicked the link.  I get eough about the damn sniper everyday at lunch while CNN looms on the big screen tv in our cafe.  This guy is like a walking CNN.  So Jackass the Movie is coming out.  I find myself strangely wanting to see it.  Dear God, what's wrong with me?  It looks funny though.  Dangerously funny.  Why do we get a kick out of seeing other people do what we would never dream of?  That basic human need to know the truth?  What really happens when you throw a bowling ball at your crotch?  So what's the in thing for Halloween this year?  Last year it was cops and firemen.  This year?  Be your greatest fear.  Fear is in.  Fear is cool.  Later.

      Woah.  Been a while since I've written on this thing.  Tani got me interested in it again.  Good ol' Tani.  Shouts out to T.  So do you ever wonder, when it's time stop living up here, and start living down here?  Oh my God.  I want to smack whoever wrote that line.  Anyone know what I'm taking about?  8 Mile.  New movie with Eminem in it.  Yeah, today's topic is how people try to be cool and turn out being more cheesy than Cheesy Bread.  (Good stuff by the way)  So let's take a good current example.  8 Mile.  I have not seen this movie nor will I.  You know, I'd love to give Eminem a chance and see what kind of actor he can be, but when the preview for the movie starts with the line above, I lose all respect for it immediately.  I assume Eminem has some contacts in Hollywood, and said something like, "You know, I think you should make a movie about a guy on the streets who tries to do something with his life"  Oh, cause that's never been done before.  Especially by a music star.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  On the other hand, movies that I've seen lately that don't suck:  "The Ring" - A bit cheesy, but imagery is fantastic, if you like pyscho stuff that makes little sense.  How many surrealists does it take to change a light bulb?  Answer: A fish.  "Signs" - No one I know seems to understand that this is A MOVIE.  For Godsakes, stop taking it so damn seriously.  It's just about having faith.  It's good.  Now shut up.  "Austin Powers: Goldmember"  - Totally dumb funny.  That's it.  See ya in a few.

      Londinium  Ok.  So things are pretty damn slow today here at work.  I've been reading about "cool" fashions in Berlin, talking to a coworker who is out of the office (via instant messenger), and reading Bergdorf Goodman ads.  Oh, and I read a NASA article about life on other planets.  So my mind is mush right now, but I've decided I have one goal for next week:  I am getting a Hoxton Fin.  Yup.  See ya.  [stay tuned.  Monday I begin a research project.]

      Crazy English Summer  Well.  Everyone seems to think I'm being too pessimistic lately.  Well, not everyone, but you know what I mean.  So here goes.  This is what I have to look forward to this winter... things that make me happy, dammit.  1.  Snow  I hate snow.  But not this year!  Nope.  I am looking forward to it.  I must do at least three things to interact with the white stuff this year:  One, snow-boarding.  Guy I work with goes snow-boarding every year.  He asked me to go last year, but I said no.  Can't remember why... oh yeah, I hate snow.  But this year shall be different.  I want to volley myself over the hills and through the woods into speeding, reckless abandon.  Two, sledding.  I haven't been on a good sledding hill in years.  There's a huge hill near my apartment, however it's about ten feet from the interstate, which seems to me a little dangerous.  Either way, I will make some of my friends go find a good hill with me and go snow surfing on our asses.  (Yes, if you're reading this, you're probably going with me)  Three, build a snow man.  I want to reenact Calvin's spectacular display of winter madness.  2. Christmas  Yeah, I know we Jews don't celebrate the old Xmas, but I'm an open minded kind of guy.  For Pete's sake, people give you stuff on this holiday!  How much better can that get?  I might send some cards out this year too.  I saw some great ones at the Wexner Center Museum shop.  I think I get a discount there.  And, food.  Lots of it.  And family.  I'm getting closer to those people.  I can remember most of thier names now.  Might be nice to hang with them.  3.  Thanksgiving  Eh.  I've never had much of a problem with this aspect of the winter (Fall) but this year Amy Castaneda has decided to usher back in the age-old, Ed Castaneda tradition of having way-ward children over for a turkey dinner.  And pot.  Ted plants.  Potted Plants.  Yeah.  4.  New Years  Did you know caviar costs like $60-$200 a jar?  For Christ's sake.  But anway, I'm bringing caviar with me to whatever New Years party I'm going to.  And I'm looking forward to it.  5.  Possible war with Iraq  Oops, sorry, that's not a happy thing.  6.  Toldeo  I'll be making my way up to Toledo sometime during the winter.  Toledo is just cool as it is, but as an added incentive, my mom's side of the family all live up there.  They are too cool for words.  So there.  That's what will make me happy all winter.  Satisfied?  Sheesh...

      Sex and Everything  Anyone out there watch much CNN?  Seeing as most of the people that read this little Blog are my close friends, you probably don't.  No, no, don't take that the wrong way.  I'm not saying that none of you are interested in what's going on in the world... quite the contrary.  I'm saying, if you're like me, you think CNN is ridiculous.  I have the utmost (UTMOST) pleasure of being able to watch CNN up close and personal everyday in my company's cafe.  Yeah, we call it a cafe.  You wanna fight about it?  Anyway... I remember when I first realised CNN was going down hill:  There we were, my coworkers and I, eating our lunch, mindlessly watching the world pass us by on the big screen television.  When lo, it was annouced before the commercial break that when CNN came back, they'd have a must know story on the events of Brittany Spears' recent breakup.  We all stared at each other in stunned disbelief.  Brittany Spears had broken up?  How could this be?  And in God's name, WHY THE HELL WOULD ANYONE CARE?!  CNN promptly came back on, and as promised, told us how the young lass had decided to call it quits with young Mr. Timberlake.  What a sad, sad state of affairs, when the cable channel which caused me great pain when I was a child because it was "Sooo boring..." had arrived at the nadir of news reporting first made so popular by MTV News.  Now that I was no longer a child, it was catering to just that.  In the days and months since, CNN has continued to tumble down the cable news trash chute at an ever increasing rate.  Recently, during the melee of the sniper attacks, CNN reported that there may have been a connection between the location of the shootings and the Michael's craft stores.  However, in almost the same breath, the asinine reporter announced that the Virigina police had not found any such links and that this was speculation on the part of CNN.  Oh well, great.  That's the kind of right on, investigative reporting I expect from the once leader of cable news.  No, mere facts are not good enough for CNN anymore!  Let's presume to know what's going on before anyone else does.  That way we'll look like we really know that much more about the sniper attacks.  And, at the same time put a few Michael's out of business simply to boost ratings.  American news reporting at its finest.  Oh the days when CNN was boring and simply reported the facts.  How I long for when they were not in everyone's business... when I found out about a war, after it started, not a week before.  Do me a favour, if you need to go "Around the world in thirty minutes..." don't choose CNN as your travel guide.  Watch Fox News or MSNBC.  Peace; out.

      It smells bad.  If pale yellow had a scent, this is what I imagine it would smell like.  Kind of like pudding mixed with rubber and dust.  It does't usually bother me if I'm only there once in a great while; but three days in a row... that's enough.  So today I'm taking a break from the smell.  When I'm there I feel like it's all an act.  I feel surrounded by automatons.  Sometimes someone comes in that's human or has some feeling, but they're few and far between.  Even though there are so many other people there with you, it can be a very lonely place.  They try to make everything clean, but it feels unnatural.  I wonder, if my house doesn't smell like a hospital, does that mean it's not clean?

      Cognito Ergo Sum  Not much to write about latley.  Sorry to dissappoint my fans...  :)  Boy, oh boy was it fun cooking with Tani last week!!  We (well she, but I helped!) made lasagna.  All was going well until Tani and I determined that we had to do something with the noodles before we actually layed them together with the meet and cheese.  So we decided to place each stip of lasagna on to paper towels in order for them to... to...  I'm not sure why we did it.  But nontheless it was interesting.  The lasagna turned out great!!  Good job T!  Went on the Roving with Susan and Josh on Saturday.  For those of you who don't know, the "Roving" is this get together that the people in Josh & Sue's area have every three months.  J & S's area is up and coming, so many of the homes there have recently been bought, gutted, and remodeled... or in some cases, the gutting had already been done.  Anyway, three homes that have recently (or sometimes not at all) been remodeled are volunteered to be showcased during the night.  A group of people then go roving from one house to another to look at what's been done, talk to the owner's, get home ideas, and generally just mingle with the neighbors.  Each person that goes on the roving is required to bring some beverage for them to drink.  J & S and I brought wine (as usual).  And, again, as usual each home we looked at was old and gorgeously remodeled.  And huge.  It makes you both want to do something like this with a house of your own, and at the same time seems like such a daunting task that you never want to undertake it...  oh well, it's fun to see anyway.  We all then went back to J & S's where Kyle and Jody came over and we all sat around a small bonfire in J & S's back yard.  :)  Gotta go work now...

      Adventures in Babysitting  Too harsh?  Can we talk?  I have had it up to HERE with my cousins.  Boy oh boy can they be annoying sometimes.  They've been calling me lately to talk about thier issues up in Toledo.  I haven't even gone up there for the holidays yet, and already I'm sick of them.  My one cousin, Andrea, is all about this guy she broke up with.  She hasn't even been with him all that long... I think.  I can't remember exactly when they met.  But I didn't even think they were that serious.  She kinda stays in the dark when she's dating someone, and doesn't really talk about it.  But now... oh boy.  It's all coming out now.  I don't knwo what to tell her tho... and then sometimes I have to feign death to get her to shut up.  Then there's my other cousin Jenny.  She's doing just fine relationship-wise, however she wants to talk to me about it all constantly.  Emails, calls, pictures... good lord.  I don't know what it is with these two, but they're driving me to drink.  Ok, enough of that.  I'll be up there to see them soon enough.  I'll live... I think.  My friend Kyle got a job!  Was starting to worry about that boy.  So if you see him, send him congrats.  My mom got her Mini.  Sent me pictures the other day.  I'm so jealous.  Although, I'm not sure how I feel about the double stripes on the front hood.  Is it just me, or does it look... not so Minish that way?  Er something...  MINE would have had the Union Jack painted on top.  I finished Memoirs of a Geisha in seven days flat.  I think that's a record since my high school days.  Great book.  I highly recommend it.  New teahouse just opened in the Short North.  Tell all your friends.  Pretty nifty.  Deserts, tons of teas, serving sets...  Um... Thanksgiving is tomorrow, so thanks for giving me something.  Later.

                                 You know what I hate?&nbsp; I hate these damn apartment people.&nbsp; Specifically, the apartment people I&#8217;m trying to work with.&nbsp; As stated in a previous blog, I&#8217;ve applied for an apartment in Old Towne East; a rather lovely up and coming area, that I would very much like to live in.&nbsp; Not only is the apartment itself physically in great condition and aesthetically pleasing, but it is near a few of my good friends.        &nbsp;        But oh no, even though I applied for the apartment last FRIDAY, they STILL have not processed my application.&nbsp;         &nbsp;        Yes, yes, the woman (we&#8217;ll call her Tina Bo Bina for now), said as of yesterday, &#8220;I was out yesterday [Monday] so I haven&#8217;t gotten to your application yet.&nbsp; Just give me a little time.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll work something out.&#8221;&nbsp; But it&#8217;s been twenty-four hours since I spoke with her.&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that enough time to electronically process my application?!&nbsp; You can Google me for free and in less time!        &nbsp;        Tina Bo Bina seems like a very nice person to be honest, and yes, she did sound a bit under the weather yesterday so maybe she&#8217;s working slower.&nbsp; But for Pete&#8217;s sake lady, give my application to someone else to handle if you&#8217;re so backed up.&nbsp; I do know at least two other people work in that office: some woman who answers the phone as though she lived on a plantation in Jawjah, with the sense of urgency of a snail; and gentleman named Scott who originally showed me the apartment.&nbsp; Scott is quite an astute fellow too, and seemed eager to get the apartment rented.&nbsp; In fact, from comments they&#8217;ve all made, they ALL sound eager to get this thing rented ASAP.&nbsp; I believe when I first inquired about the apartment Ms. Jawjah stated, &#8220;Oh yes we have a 1 bedroom, and it&#8217;s got your name on it!&#8221;&nbsp; It was the fastest thing I&#8217;ve heard her say yet.        &nbsp;        Y&#8217;all stay tuned now, ya hear?

                     st1\:*{behavior:url(#default#ieooui) }                        Well, hello there girls and boys!           &nbsp;         Look at this, something new on my blog!&nbsp; Amazing, huh?&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, I can hear what you&#8217;re saying, &#8220;Yeah sure, one entry in his blog&#8230; we won&#8217;t see another one for another two years&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; Now, now be nice.&nbsp; But you&#8217;re probably right.&nbsp;     J               &nbsp;         What&#8217;s new with me you ask?&nbsp; Well looks like my stint with my roommate Jeremy is coming to an end.&nbsp; Long story short, he&#8217;s going back to school, just got laid off from his job, and has decided to take this opportunity to go full time and live on loans and unemployment.&nbsp; And thus, he wants to find his own place on campus.&nbsp; More power to him!&nbsp; I am quite ready to be on my own again as well, so hooray!&nbsp; It&#8217;s time to celebrate!&nbsp; Well, not just yet.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve put in an application for a place in Old Towne East, but have not heard back from them yet.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll see how that goes.&nbsp; In the meantime, cross your fingers.&nbsp; Move out date is June 26 th .           &nbsp;         It&#8217;s  11:47  pm  as I sit here and write this.&nbsp; I recently downloaded (ahem, I mean bought) &#8220;Room For Squares&#8221; by John Mayer.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve heard a few songs on here before, but never the whole album.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; Only thing is, it kind of makes me sad&#8230; It reminds me of last summer when I hung out with my upstairs neighbor Carrie a lot.&nbsp; She got me hooked on John when she let me borrow CD of hers that had him on it.&nbsp; In fact, I think I still have the CD somewhere&#8230; gotta get that back to her.&nbsp; Anyway, I&#8217;m sad &#8216;cause once I move, she won&#8217;t be 10 feet from me&#8230;&nbsp; No more of our impromptu wine nights on the porch, or our crazy attempts to break in to the pool at  1 am , and our obnoxiously drunk efforts to go through every high school and college picture she has.&nbsp;     J               &nbsp;         But of course, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll stay friends even after I&#8217;ve moved, so we can still have wine nights at my new place, wherever that may be.           &nbsp;         Congrats on your graduation Carrie!           &nbsp;         &#8220;She&#8217;s always buzzing, just like&#8230;&#8221;

                                 EXTRA!&nbsp; EXTRA!&nbsp; The dog has been taken away.&nbsp; Yup, my dumber than a box of rocks roommate has finally taken his dog to his new apartment.&nbsp; Sadly, I fear that even though the dog is now living in the same place as his owner, he&#8217;ll be no better off&#8230;&nbsp; this is not my concern now though.&nbsp; (At least, that&#8217;s what I try to tell myself)        &nbsp;        Three days and counting until I get my keys!

                                 So what do you want to know?&nbsp; Let&#8217;s see&#8230; I finally heard back from the rental office.&nbsp; I was approved and all is well.&nbsp; Moving day is the 15 th !&nbsp; Well, technically, I have a truck scheduled for the 20 th , but I get the keys on the 15 th .&nbsp; I can&#8217;t wait!&nbsp; And, what&#8217;s more, I bought a brand new 27&#8221; (Shut up, 27&#8221; is just fine for me) Panasonic flat tube television.&nbsp; It&#8217;s slick.&nbsp; And, it&#8217;s silver.        &nbsp;        Let&#8217;s see&#8230; I also bought a new couch and loveseat!&nbsp; They are a sort of moss green&#8230; nice color.&nbsp; I still need to get a coffee table, and two end tables, but I think I&#8217;m gonna go to Target for hat.&nbsp; And, thanks to my pal Susan, I&#8217;m going to get a bakers rack, and use that as my entertainment center.&nbsp; I think it will go quite well.&nbsp; Then in the future I will get my perfect television stand&#8230; which I don&#8217;t think exists.        &nbsp;        Other than that, not much else going on in JJ land.&nbsp; Oh, I was in an accident.&nbsp; I&#8217;m fine!&nbsp; My car is fine also, thanks to Josh.&nbsp; I rear-ended someone.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve told this story twenty times, so I&#8217;ll make this short.&nbsp; I was looking out my window, to the left to check for traffic in the next lane, so I could make a lane change, and was not paying attention to traffic in front of me.&nbsp; Bang, I hit a guy.&nbsp; My fault.&nbsp; I was bad.&nbsp; Not much damage to the other car, as far as I could tell, and the dude driving seemed to be fine.&nbsp; I have to pay a fine of $150.        &nbsp;        My idiot roommate has pretty much moved out and is now living with his nineteen year old friend&#8230; pretty dumb if you ask me.&nbsp; He took most of his furniture except for his bed and computer desk.&nbsp; Oh that&#8217;s right, HE LEFT HIS DOG TOO.&nbsp; Yeah, the dog spends all day locked up in my roommates old bedroom&#8230; doing nothing.&nbsp; I think my roommate comes home maybe once a day and lets him out.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know if he just expects me to take care of the dog or what, but I think it&#8217;s cruel and irresponsible.&nbsp; And yes, I do take care of the dog, and play with him, and all that jazz, but it&#8217;s still morally wrong, and pathetic.&nbsp; His reason for all this?&nbsp; He and his 19 year old moron in training do not yet have room for the dog at their place.&nbsp;         Gee, if I had a dog, room for the dog would be at the top of my list of need in an apartment, but no, not when you&#8217;re my incredibly stupid roommate!        &nbsp;        Aight.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve written mucho stuffo, so I&#8217;m gonna go-o.&nbsp; Y&#8217;all come back now, ya hear?

                               One more thing about my mildly retarded soon-to-be ex-roommate.&nbsp; Ya know how he wanted so badly to move back downtown to the Short North?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Well, he did.&nbsp; He just &#8220;hated&#8221; living so far out east because, in his words, &#8220;it&#8217;s too much of a hassle to drive to work in Reynoldsburg, then go to school at OSU, and then drive to the gym, and then drive all the way back to [Easton].&#8221;&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; I guess since he doesn&#8217;t have a freaking job anymore, 1/3 of that statement has no bearing anymore, huh?        &nbsp;        OK, so what does Mr. I-Hate-Living-So-Far-From-All-The-Other-Fags do?&nbsp; He moves in with his 19 year old friend in REYNOLDSBURG!&nbsp; I&#8217;ll say that again, R-E-Y-N-O-L-D-S-B-U-R-G.&nbsp; For those of you who do not know Columbus and environs, Reynoldsburg is an east side suburb that is about 4 miles FARTHER east than Easton (where we live now).        &nbsp;        I&#8217;m not even gonna get in to the fact that he moved in with a 19 year old, and he&#8217;s twenty-eight.&nbsp; Not even gonna mention it.        &nbsp;        Idiot.

                                 No, not really.&nbsp; I was just reading an article in  urlLink Slate magazine  online (a great liberal dispatch on the craziness of this modern world, I recommend you read) about how the  urlLink National Enquirer  is actually completely fact based; albeit obnoxious about what it considers to be news&#8230; when I saw a link to another, far less trustworthy  urlLink tabloid , claiming that indeed the Pontiff had been struck by a space rock.&nbsp; God forbid.        &nbsp;        But I digress.&nbsp; Today is technically the first day I can begin moving in to my new apartment.&nbsp; I receive the golden keys at 5 pm today.&nbsp; Well, OK, they&#8217;re not golden, but can you tell this day is like money to me?&nbsp;  urlLink (&#8220;You&#8217;re so money!&#8221;) &nbsp; I&#8217;m obsessed with my move in!&nbsp; I guess I&#8217;m just so excited to have a place I can call my own, where I can call all the shots, where no one else is invited unless I say so, where I can have silence when I please, no dog hair everywhere, nice new furniture, and loads of other fun-loving bachelor plans.&nbsp; And, I&#8217;m back downtown, in the  urlLink heart of it all !        &nbsp;        So wish me luck this week as I begin my moving adventure.&nbsp; And please, pray to the furniture gods that my  urlLink new couch and loveseat  fit through my front door&#8230;        &nbsp;        Cheers.

                     All is good.&nbsp; I've been living in my new place  officially for almost three weeks now.      &nbsp;    Everything went smooth with the old  apartment.&nbsp; I cleaned my part, and Jeremy, amazingly, cleaned his.&nbsp; He  even followed through on his promise to clean the carpets.&nbsp; Hmm... guess he  really wanted that deposit back?&nbsp; Enough that he took some  initiative.      &nbsp;    If you haven't already received my email, check out  my improved website,  http://home.columbus.rr.com/grandmasterj       &nbsp;    It's astounding.&nbsp; No, it's not, but I felt  like saying that.      &nbsp;    Let's see, what else is new... nothing.&nbsp; How  was my fourth you ask?&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to Ed &amp; Amy's for a graduation  party for Ed, and a sorta 4th of July party. That was a good time.&nbsp; Saw  some peeps I haven't seen in a while, and the best part of all:&nbsp; Josh blew  stuff up!&nbsp; But if anyone asks, no, he didn't.      &nbsp;    Aight.&nbsp; Time for me to go.&nbsp; One last  thing, remember:      &nbsp;    IT ALL GOES DOWN AT THE TEA HOUSE.      &nbsp;    Night kiddos.

                     I was looking at my Verizon bill.&nbsp; I couldn't  think of a title.      &nbsp;    I have my headphones on, and I'm listening to my  latest downloads.&nbsp; I can't stop playing Steppin' Out by Kaskade, over, and  over, and over, and over... you get it.      &nbsp;    Not much going on lately.&nbsp; Well, there is one  thing, but I'm NOT going in to that here.&nbsp; Let me just say one thing,  Foley's are NOT for the timid.      &nbsp;    I can't think of 10 new songs to place on my "What  I'm listening to" page on my website, so I'm not updating that this week.&nbsp;  But I will say, download "Da Hype" by Junior Jack when you get a chance.&nbsp;  Nifty little tune there.      &nbsp;    Went to Picnic With the Pops on Saturday evening  with "The Gang".&nbsp; Loads of fun.&nbsp; TBDBITL was the guest band, and they  rocked, as always.&nbsp; Then we went to... ah... um... a bar called... aaah...  I forget.&nbsp; But it's in an office building, and it kind of reminds me of the  Regal Beagle.&nbsp; I'd never been there, but had always been  curious.      &nbsp;    Then we went to the legendary Amicons.&nbsp; I hope  I spelled that right.&nbsp; Wasn't as bad as Ed and Susan had always  described.&nbsp; Amicons reminds me of&nbsp;the Lobo.&nbsp; We played some pool  and then pooped out around 1 or so.      &nbsp;    Unfortunately I sorta fell off my quit-smoking  wagon, so I'll have to work on that next time I go out.      &nbsp;    Fun times were had by all.      &nbsp;    Oh dude, I just checked my Soulseek, and I found an  Essential Mix with Junior Jack.&nbsp; What timing.      &nbsp;    I'm going to go listen to music now.&nbsp; I'm  tired of typing, and you bore me.
