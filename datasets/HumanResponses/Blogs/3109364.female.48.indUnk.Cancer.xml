						   Some days I feel like God has put me in limbo.  It feels like the whole world is revolving and I've gotten off.  I know people are bustling about all around me - at work, at play, at school, at home - bustling.  But I seem to have gotten off and find myself in this place of "in between".  There is plenty to do.  It's not that.  I find myself wandering from chore to chore around the house feeling disconnected.  What am I supposed to do? More laundry?  more sweeping?  more dusting?  more cleaning?  or soaking.  soaking in Him.  soaking in His creation.  soaking in His healing.  soaking up His love.  Excuse me while I go get pruny.

						   Life is so interesting.  Yesterday I decided to cut all my hair off.  It wasn't that long but long for me and it's a pretty drastic change.  I've gotten some interesting responses.  Max loves it.  I think it makes us look even more alike.  Geof loves it too.  He said it was me - I think he's right - it is.  It feels right.  Isn't that silly?  A simple thing like hair.  It's almost like I have uncovered myself as a result of talking Wednesday night at church.  At first I thought changing my hair would help me not be recognized on Sunday when I have to go back there.  But, you know what?  Now I think it is a freedom issue.  I think I was hiding in that hair.  I am released.  I may even let it go natural.  Now that would really be something.  I wonder sometimes what I really look like.  Who I really am.  I think God is revealing it to me in huge waves.  Hope I don't get sucked under by the undertow.  But if it's God's revelation, I know I won't.  I trust Him.  Surf's up.

						   An amazing thing happened last night.  I spoke truth to a rather large group at my church.  I opened myself up and let several hundred people in.  Scary thought if Jesus had not been there holding the door.  But He was.  That was evident.  It's time to share the healing and the joy of His strength and His love.  I've known for some time this day was coming and I fought it rather selfishly until the time came and it seemed so right.  It all boils down one more time to surrender and willingness.    I have no idea what comes next.  But I know when it is time, God will reveal my path.  For now, I bask in His goodness, His faithfulness and His promise to never leave me or forsake me.  Today I feel His Presence and I am at peace.

						   I've spent most of the day once again readying my house for a party on Saturday.  My old friend, Cindy, is coming home and bringing her new husband, Allen.  I'm excited for Cindy.  She deserves a break and I am praying Allen is part of it.  I pray he's nice and kind and loves her with his whole heart.  And I pray she is and does, too.  I've missed Cindy for quite some time now but it feels like a new person is coming back, not the old Cindy.  I'm nervous and this shows in my preparations for a family get together that reeks of wanting everything to be perfect.  Families should be able to go to one another's homes perfect or not.  I so badly wany my family of choice to know that I welcome them at any time - prepared or not - invited or not.  The door is always wide open.  I've lived so many years of my life in perfectionism that I think I have them trained to wait for an invitation.  Now that is sad.  I'm not a very good inviter either.  Wide open.  That's my new motto.  Now to get the word out.

						   I'm squeezing a little blog in before I take Max to school this morning.  Today I'm excited to spend time planting - this translates to "playing in the dirt".  I love dirt.  It makes me happy.  Sometimes I enjoy pulling things out of the dirt more than putting things in it.  I think this is representative of my life.  I may still be pulling weeds - but soon, very soon, I will be planting seeds.  Interesting that weeds and seeds rhyme.  I wonder what that's all about.  Could it be that we confuse them?  Sometimes we may be pulling weeds that were really planted seeds....hmmm.  There's something to think about.  I think I will - while I play in the dirt.

						   This is my first blog.  It's an interesting concept.  I've been keeping a journal now for 4 years, one I have no intention of anyone ever reading and if so, only after I am long gone.  I occasionally have thoughts of someday writing something the world will read, or maybe a small portion of the world.  Then I think, what would I have to say that would intrigue a small portion of the world.  So, I continue to keep a journal and know those words will be my son Max's heritage one day (at which point I freak out and hope someone burns them first).  Now I find myself writing in a small white rectangle on my computer screen knowing if I tell anyone about it, they can read these words.  Wow, talk about pressure.

						   It's Memorial Day weekend.  A time for memories.  A time for memorializing those who have gone before and served.  I have a lot of men in my family's history who have done just that - served this country.  They fought for our freedom and, though none died in combat, at least one died from the results of his service.  My Uncle Jake Cobb was a prisoner of war in Japan.  He has a tremendously interesting story.  He the lived through the Bataan Death March to spend the next 3 years in a prison camp.  The story goes that one of his guards was an American of Japanese descent who had been visiting his grandparents in Japan when the war broke out and he was detained.  He ended up guarding his own fellow citizens.  He is the only reason they lived.  He served them.  He put his own life on the line to save theirs.  And when the war was over and our military came to set the captives free this servant was one of those they killed.  What a tragedy.  What a story.  My uncle came home from this experience a changed man.  They say his hair was white and that he was skin and bone.  He died several years later of the effects of this experience.  I'm sure he never forgot this Japanese American who saved his life.  Today I remember them both.  And I am very grateful.  If not for men like these I would not be free.  Thank you God for men and women who are willing to go beyond this day to day life here in the U.S. in order to fight for our freedom to live this day to day life here in the U.S.  Keep them safe.  Bless them today.

						   I just love watching God work.  It's more fun to watch it in someone else than to experience it in myself.  One of my dearest friends, scratch that - my dearest friend got up in front of our church tonight and told her story.  She has such strength and hope and is filled with God's pure light.  Her face told the story behind her story.  The tears and pain of a lifetime filtered through but so did the pride and joy of a new baby boy born to her youngest daughter just 48 hours earlier.  amazing.  God is so good.  Imagine Him planning that knowing she was going to talk about the generations.  I pray that someone, if not many, who were in the room tonight will want what Lynette has.  I pray that they will come to that place of brokenness that sends them to their knees in surrender, crying out to God, their Rock and their Redeemer and restoration will be begin.  Thank you Father.

						   It's been awhile since I last blogged.  I guess I got busy reading everyone else's.  This whole world of blogging fascinates me.  I love reading what people write about their lives and their insights into life and I love reading the comments others leave.  In some ways I feel like I know these people better than people I see and "know" in my daily life.  It's funny.  We'll write things on a white computer screen we normally wouldn't maybe say to someone we see every other day.  I kinda love that.  And it makes me sad, too.  Are we just too busy to sit down and talk to each other - is the tv on - are there other distractions that lead us to superficial conversations instead of what we really think or feel?  Or is it just me?  You know, I think it's just me.  Now that I write this I imagine the rest of the world having meaningful conversations beyond the mundane.  I know I do too, it just doesn't happen all that often.  I feel the need, the desire for a four hour conversation over dinner with friends and family.  No tv.  No sports talk.  No distractions.  Just a table, food, good wine, and men and women conversing together - not women at one table and men at the other.  What are we all thinking?  What do we really want to say?  I think it would be interesting to find out.  Can we do this with both sexes and no sports talk?  I don't know.  Maybe I'll have someone over and find out.

						   Last night marked the end of my first stint teaching the 6th grade girls class on Wednesday nights at our church.  We had 15 girls who came fairly regularly.  These 15 girls stole my heart.  I never dreamed that could be possible to this extent.  I figured I'd become fond of them but it goes way beyond that.  I will really miss them.  I'd never taught this age group before last summer when I was recruited to help with Learning to Lead camp at ACU during one week in the summer. And then I signed on more or less as crowd control to backup a friend and her daughter with a group of 20 kids going into 6th grade.  My ulterior motive was to get my own son to go.  The morning of day 4 I got a call from said friend who informed me that her daughter had kidney stones and they'd been at the hospital all night.  I was on my own.  I nearly panicked and then I remembered God was in control.  I decided to trust Him.  It was such a blessing.  I learned alot about listening and hearing God, trusting and obeying and the incredible sense of relief and comaraderie and no-longer-aloneness one can feel when you do listen, hear, trust and obey.  It gave me the confidence to walk up to Diane Cope's car one day at soccer practice and say without thinking, "Hey Diane, if you ever need help in the 6th grade girls class, I'd be willing."  (Willingness is another huge lesson I'm learning and have come a long way developing.)  I walked away and 20 minutes later my whole life changed.  It seems she was sitting in the car praying that God would show her who He wanted to be in there helping her teach.  One of her teachers had decided to move on and the other was pregnant and would need some time off.  So she was pretty much blown away by my offhanded suggestion.  She came up to me sitting in my lawn chair and asked if I really meant it.  I said, "sure I guess so."  And the rest is, as they say, is History.  Diane has told me several times throughout this past year that this is where I am supposed to be.  It has been fun.  It has been insightful.  It has been challenging.  It has been moving.  I'll have a hard time letting these 15 girls go.  I'll miss each one of them.  God has used them to change my life and the way I think of myself and of Him.  I will never be the same.  I hope they won't either.

						    I've been challenged by   urlLink  bobbie    to think about what flower I'd be if I could be a flower.&nbsp; I keep going back and forth from a wildflower - any wildflower - to a gerbera daisy.&nbsp; I like to think of myself as a wildflower because, well, they're wild and I've always wanted to be wild.&nbsp; There were a few years back in my twenties where I probably was a wildflower, though in ways that were very unhealthy.&nbsp; I rather wanted to have the nerve to have purple hair and pierce things people at that time weren't piercing (but never my tongue! ouch!).&nbsp; I wanted to make wild art that noone understood but that I never could figure out how to make either.&nbsp; I wanted to dance and shout at inappropriate times like in the grocery store or sitting at my desk at work.&nbsp; My best friend could do this and I so loved and admired her for it, but I never could bring myself to do it.&nbsp; I guess I'm really more like a gerbera daisy these days.&nbsp; More controlled, yet brilliantly colorful and reaching toward the son.&nbsp; I want to stand out as a searcher and it seems that's what gerbera daisies do.&nbsp; They stand out and they search for the way up.&nbsp; So, I choose the gerbera daisy.&nbsp; They're delightful and fun and strong and tall.&nbsp; They look like they're laughing.&nbsp; I like that.&nbsp; But deep down inside I'm still a wildflower wannabe.&nbsp; What flower are you?

						    On Sunday I   celebrated my  48th birthday.&nbsp; It was a pretty low key day.&nbsp; The only thing that really stands out - okay there are two things - one was that I woke up in a beautiful place with my family and two of my dearest friends and the other is the one I want to write about.&nbsp; I can't seem to get it out of my mind.&nbsp; Maybe because it's been awhile since I felt His presence and even though it was very subtle and sweet, it has stayed with me as if it were a grand miracle.&nbsp; I found myself on the deck of my friend Squeaky's house in the Texas hill country all alone with a cup of coffee, binoculars and God.&nbsp; It was overcast and very mild with the sound of thunder echoing in the background (or was that God whispering in my ear?).&nbsp; I was looking out over a pond, birds were singing, a gentle rain began to fall, squirrels scampered in the huge beautiful trees and a titmouse (which was one of my great discoveries over the weekend - not a mouse at all but a precious little pointy headed bird) was eating from the birdfeeder 3 feet away.&nbsp;&nbsp;A doe wandered by stopping to eat and listen to the thunder.&nbsp; I wonder, was it her birthday too and was God also singing to her?&nbsp; It was one of those moments in time where all is still and the world and life seem perfect.&nbsp; Thank you Father for the perfect birthday gift.&nbsp; You.&nbsp; Thank you Squeaky for making it possible.&nbsp; I love you both very much.&nbsp;

						   I just made a phone call that was alot harder than I even thought it would be.  Eight months ago our friends and part of our family of choice asked us to go on vacation with them to Florida where we would get a condo on the beach and hang out for a week with our 3 kids ages 22, 18 and 12.  The 22 and 18 year olds are their girls and the 12 year old is our son.  They are his only sisters.  He is their little brother. We made plans and wrestled with the travel agent over getting them just right.  They left yesterday and we're still here.  My son, Max, was selected as an All-Star by his little league and it has changed everything.  I am torn.  I love to watch him play.  He really is so good and he LOVES this game.  So does his dad.  It's a kick to see them together even though I am an outsider in this world of testosterone.  To me, the vacation was a big deal.  To them the game is.  They wanted to go to Florida but they want to stay and play more.  It's a team and you don't walk out on your team.  To me, it's family and you don't walk out on family.  (Did I mention it's Erin's graduation trip?) It's all so very interesting.  Quite a quagmire of feelings and thoughts reside here on this plane of one week in the summer of 2004.  I'm happy for Max that he made the team - two years ago when he should have but didn't I thought my heart would break from the look on his face when he read the list of players.  I'm excited to be in the stands filming his every move and cheering him on.  But another part of my heart longs to spend 5 days on the beach with our family.  These girls will be gone soon.  We all know that reality lurks in the not-so-distant future.  I want so badly for Max to have this connection with them - which he does - but doesn't time spent together secure that bond?  Someday they may be the only family he has.  And that makes my heart hurt more.  I wish for them memories like a week on the beach together.  I've fooled myself into thinking it's the money we've spent that was bothering me - but it's not.  It's the absence of memories that's left a hole in my heart.  So, I just called and left a message on their cell phone and told them it's turned into a family vacation for them and that we wouldn't be joining them.  My voice was cracking and heart was crying out.  But tonight I will be in the bleachers cheering on Max and his team with my whole heart - making a memory.

						    I'm sitting here staring at a blank white space with the daunting task before me of filling it with words.  It's funny, though I am an active participant in the blogging world as far as reading and commenting I've come to find that this practice of writing is eluding me.  I spend the day with thoughts rampantly rolling around in my head, I even wake up with thoughts of things to write and then I come in here and instead of pulling up my blank white space I go to all of your incredibly creative blog sights and become entranced.  I never seem to get back here.  So, today I decided to start here and see what rolls out onto the screen.  How honest will I be.  How honest can I be.  I know one thing.  There is alot to learn about this blogging business.  Like how do you people get pictures in your blog.  I need to take the time to figure that one out.  I got a digital camera for my birthday and I have been on a rampage with it.  I've gotten some great garden shots.  So, I really need to learn how to do that.  But that would mean taking time away from reading all the wisdom out there.  Man oh man, so little time and so much to be done.  Which brings to mind one thing I've been wanting to blog about.  I've twice experienced a new phenomenon for me - soaking prayer.  A friend of mine has turned her home into a Soaking Center on Monday nights.  People from the Body of Christ walk in her front door (no need to knock) at 7pm and for the next 3 hours their home is dedicated to the Spirit.  No other program.  Just soaking in Him.  At first I was wary.  I wasn't sure what soaking in the Spirit would look or sound like and I'm still pretty much a control freak when it comes to how I look or sound in any given situation.  (I really am trying to let that go.)  But for now it looks like a whole bunch of people laying on the floor with pillows - resting.  And it sounds like music.  And it feels like peace - heavy peace - glorious peace.  It amazes me that in this busy, bustling existence one can find such peace in the living room of a friend, lying on the floor in a room full of acquaintances and strangers.  And all it takes is taking the time and inviting the Spirit to come.  A simple affair.  Giant results.  I cannot wait until Monday.
