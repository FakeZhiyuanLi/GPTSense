      Now, it's time to put more effort on my dissertation. I really really want to finish it as soon as possible. Just because I've never go anywhere for holidays.  I decide to start typing some report but since we have to use Latex format. so, I have to learn how to use these tools (life is full of learning .. ha ha)  Cause i'm still windows user. I have to do it in the windows way.  1. install cygwin 2. install xemacs  this link is very useful for learning how to install and make it work!  urlLink http://home.imf.au.dk/hellmund/xemacs.html   Now, i'm trying to use latex.

      I'm so happy that my mom called me from on my birthday (in thailand time). But at that time in Edinburgh, It's 22 May. So, I'm still working. I call her back after i'm at home and we have a little chat:)  Thanks for the card and the gift :) Also I really enjoy the dinner at the McKelly Steak House with your family.  xxx

      I got a problem with loading text file into program to classify. I just finished figure out what happen to the data !!! There are 6 lines errors of all 61 files..I have to fix manually But it's not so bad. It give me an inspiration to work on with my project.  Anyway, I need more consistent content! The biological data needs some standard of database

      Just finish watching the last samurai movie last night. It's quite a good movie although it's really hollywood movie. But at least, there is no real love scene in the movie which is good :)  I give this movie about 7/10.  Now, i want to see other movies (in DVD) such as  - cheaper by dozen - payback - lord of the ring - etc.  i think i should wait to watch them only 1 movie a week.. ha ha

      Now, I just realize the meaning of the word 'research' It's really mean 're' + 'search'  Because one paper refers to many papers. So, i have to  re search those papers to understand what i have to do.  so so so many papers to read Y_Y'  i'll try to summarize and then do the ppt file to present  my project on this 7 June,2004.

      ---------------------------------------------------------  Can the language u speak change your identity ?  ---------------------------------------------------------  This question is from my friends when we talk together in the little party with some drinks;)  If you are Thai and speak Thai .. that's definitely your identity. But if you speak other languages which are not your mother language,  is that can change you identity ?  What do you think about it?  For me, it's quite hard to express yourself in other language. But you are the way you are. So, the way you act is still yourself. It's not that hard to make everybody understand the real you ;)

       RuanThai , Thai restaurant in  urlLink Edinburgh , Scotland      "People of a certain age may remember Mr Ben, a children's cartoon where a gentleman entered a shop that led to exotic other worlds. I got a similar feeling when I went to the  RuanThai .  RuanThai sits down a cobbled lane in Cockburn Street and on entering the establishment, you are immediately transported somewhere far away, like Shangri-La.   This is simply one of the most imaginative and beautiful interiors you'll see in the Capital; a spacious restaurant in an alley split into three intimate rooms bedecked in traditional Thai carving and panelling,with blossoms hanging in lattices from the roof. The enhanted atmosphere is perfected by the scent of flowers and traditional Thai background music.   RuanThai literally means 'Thai house', and owner has literally built one with his family. His skills in design are matched by his skills as a restaurateur, which has led to RuanThai becoming a popular destination over the past two years for the young, fashionable set who lounge around Cockburn Street and its environs. The decor may be traditional Thai, however the menu is contemporary, with one clever twist being the Pad Thai Loog Thoong, which translates as 'the cowboy noodle', and is a clever twist on the classic Pad Thai noodle.   There is a sister restaurant,  the Ruanmai , located in Rose Street, which is like one small, intimate room of the RuanThai, and caters more for business clientele. RuanThai really is something special, perfect for taking someone special to.

      You have a great product, many customers, and are delivering your product to hordes of happy customers online. Serving large files creates problems of scaling, flash crowds, and reliability.  As you grow, they become more central to your business, but your bandwidth costs go up as well. It's a vicious cycle.  There is a solution.  BitTorrent  is a simple software product which addresses all of these problems.  The key to cheap file distribution is to tap the unutilized upload capacity of your customers.    It's free.   Their contribution grows at the same rate as their demand, creating limitless scalability for a fixed cost.

         We went to T in the Park on Sunday using honda car. It took 45 minutes to drive to the Balado Airfield and the 40 minutes to walk to the camp site.  Gary set up the tent for us since yesterday.. we are so lucky ;) When we walk in to the concert arena, first thing i saw is The Red Bull stage for x-game. Wow!! red bull, you are so good at marketing. And I see 2 big outdoor stages and many concert tents and lot of people all over the area.    And also see lots of shops and a big fun park which make me think about temple festival in Thailand.. I really miss that and feel want to go to see it again. Actually, every things that they provide in T in the Park is similar to temple festival. Except we can't set the camp in Thailand.   We start with the main stage,Franz Ferdinand concert. We are quite close to the front of stage. I enjoy to see they dance. Take me out, mathinee, etc.  Then we went to see lot of thing, fun park, drinking Tennent, eating pizza. I try to play the maching in fun park, just one. The result is I got headache after that.. ha ha ha .. stupid me ;p But I still enjoy staying there all day and all night:) We went to see the chemical brother and the last few songs of the snow patrol. Then play the bump car.. very fun but i got headache again!  I really hate myself about this kind symptom:(  In the cold windy night, we have just one sleeping bag which we though might be fine for wee people like us. But we ended up using one sleeping sheet to cover us and have to find some cloth to be underneath us.. MAN!! it's really cold!!! But hey, i'm ok.. it's a good experience for us ;) Next time, there will be 2 sleeping bag and a pillow for us ..  and i won't play that things anymore .. ha ha  We came back on Monday morning..  Get what .. while we were going home, the beat 106 DJ said that the ticket for next year will be available tomorrow!! and this year it was sold out in 10 weeks. Come on Man!, we don't even have any idea which band will be in the next year !!  We arrive home sweet home and sleep very comfy in wee bed..  Oh bed! i miss u!  xxx

      Today I went to see my supervisor. We discussed about the rankgene software because I counldn't make it work. We leaved it and then go to the GA phase. The meeting took about 1 hour which many interesting points.  I went back to my house and try to figure out the problem (again)  cause I don't want to leave it behind. Then suddenly, I can figure out with no reason .. It's just a format of the files. I should've notice that ..  unix software needs unix file format  Now, I can move on to the next phase with happy feeling ;D  In conclusion, 1. transform original file into the defined format 2. normalized data 3. use rankgene software with data  Next phase, 1. writing 2. GA , KNN  Go Go Go !!!!   Thank you man for the girl style Nike hat :) It looks CooL on Me .. ha ha ha  xxx

      I haven't followed this two technologies for a while.. since i came to study here... They have been changing a lot!!  PHP releases PHP 5.0 MySQL releases so many products: database server, MaxDB, Cluster, etc.. They also release the commercial version of their product. The weakness point of their technology in my point of view is there is no support team in every country. If they have a strong support team, they definitely can take the share market of the same kind of product from the Big company.  for more information, please take a look at  urlLink  http://www.php.net   ,  urlLink  http://www.mysql.com
