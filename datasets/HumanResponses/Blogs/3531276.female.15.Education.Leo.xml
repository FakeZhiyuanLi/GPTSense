       this is my first post thing im still not even sure what this is..  messin with your friends are fun and funny!  they ride theyre skateboards down the road while they have a can  of grape soda in BOTH hands (cause you know grapes make wine)  dont you hate it when you think of something really good or funny to say after you already said something else or when the sitiation doesnt have anything to do with you.

      crinkle crinkle crinkle! hahahhaha  playing with tape&nbsp;could only be fun with Denise!  &nbsp;ima make mistakes every day!!!    THE BEST GAME EVER!   ::you must go through the spinning vortex and drop to the ground crawl towards the sun room turn the sun on and off find the baby turn the big bang wood and go past the smoke house be careful not to hit the walls and get past the moving plant and home to safety once again ! ::   denise&nbsp;was pleasantly walkin to&nbsp;my room when&nbsp;she saw a lil shadow on the floor. when&nbsp;she took a 2nd look it WAS NOT a lil shadow! it was a  GIANT HUMONGOUS CENTIPEDE  going towards&nbsp;her sleeping bag! so as any normal person would do&nbsp;she turned around jumped OVER the table and the centipede onto the sleeping bag and slid to safety!she thought she was gonna die! so normal people like we are flushed it down the toilet but before we did that we looked at it to see if it would swim to the surface! when he did not come to the top we flushed him! it was awesome!    my birthday is in 5 days!  I think were gonna go to  SIx Flags Thurday ! I got my retainer last Thursday ! its got stars on it!    Me and Denise went to Texas from Friday to Sunday for my cousins wedding! it was really fun! We hung out with Lenny and Josh and watched the kids of course! afterwards we went to JuJu's house !So we&nbsp;went swimming and then we were jumpin on the trampoline!&nbsp; Lets see what else happened?... oh yeah Denise licked her hand and wiped it on Lenny bc he dunked her in the pool! then he got her back by spitting in his hand and wiping it on her face! EWW! i know! Then we were talkin about it and Josh spit in his hand and wiped it on me so i jumped off the trampoline and chased him back and forth.. and no i didnt catch him! after i got dressed i was walkin out the bathroom and Josh was talkin to another Josh so i spit in my hand and got him back by wiping it on his face..&nbsp; and he got Denise when she walked out the bathroom! then we were outside and Lenny and Josh were playing basketball and Josh got me back and so yes i chased him down the driveway but as i was running the spit was fallin in my eyeballs it was freakin gross! And no i didnt catch him again!! i walked in the house to wash the spit off of me and Josh got Denise&nbsp;again! and then the next day she got him back at the hotel&nbsp;while&nbsp;he was sleepin! so yea it was pretty gross but our team wins! wait no Josh got Denise&nbsp;back in the pool at&nbsp;the hotel.. our team loses but Josh is gonna be down here for a week so &nbsp;we'll get him back! WE WILL CONQUER! haha and that was my weekend! im forgettin something so ill put the rest later im tired of typing!
