						   heya. bit board atm so i thought i'd write a blog! truth be told im feeling a bit lost as to what to do, lil bit of a weird feeling at the moment. think i'm gonna get a night, need to be up earlish for church neways cause of the limerick connection. stil it was a gd day, lots of fun was had @ the scheme, though i wanted to throttle alex and daire by the end of it. had aoifé today though to help me which was such a relief! me, her and ben have i thin earnt a gd group down south...but i think we got 6-8 year olds again. meh streamvale farm will b good havnt been in years! &nbsp; i must just say how bad tv is at the moment...like i dont watch as much as i used to neway but its always nce to think that if u are so bored there mite even b a ggd movie, or comedy repeat to unwind in front of, but its rubbish these days! AHHHH! there is a post on the focus board at the moment about perfect destination and it got me thinking about where mine is. i love home cause well its home and i no it and its a gd familiarty to me. always fancied the wilds of new zealand or canada myself but then again i dunno if i could stick it too much...u noi think i could though. to be&nbsp;completely&nbsp;alone wif nature in its beatuy...lol well mayb a few friends or family too! but u no wot&nbsp; i mean somewhere to escape to! i dunno i guess it does depend on the ppl there. "its no use every prospect pleasing if man is vile!" ah the wonders of PG Wodehouse...read him! im amazed that so many ppl have never heard of him...specially i dont think that my english teacher had! meh im sure ill post more about him later. thats a anofer prob wif livin away from somewhere familiar, the creature comforts. im pretty sure i could learn to live without them...a hermit...well not wuite but u no wifout worries in this day and age...gd luk! i always wonder though if i wanna live like that caus ei want less attention...or mroe lol. i dont think im attention seeking though, at elast i hope im not. lol i actually dont not even wif the drama. i think i jsut want everyfing to be from a movie...grand and amazing! living in belfast mite i spose mite dull that a bit lol but i still love it! thats y i love to act so that everything can b from a movie...big and *shivers* u no wot i mean? mayb since things like playboy and scarecrow i have got a lil bit more...but i think i just want bigger challanges and i wanna pull them off! i dont think thats attenion seeking...its jsut natural u wanna b succesful in ur job (lol job!?!? ok wot u do i dunno i i wanna act as a job...well hehe) this wont b the last time u hear bout it lol. specially if i get into middle school drama again. o and if ur interested...well the scarecrow mite just b reborn!!!! *watch this space* dunno if its a gd idea though but we shall c! &nbsp; flip i didnt eman to write this much guess it just pours out a bit when i get started :P. meh a well (btw if ur wondering and im sure u rnt i awlays think of a title after i finish the blog...its the budding author in me...wanna make it gd!) &nbsp; ttyl! keep on dreaming &nbsp; Duff

						    why hello there, do you come here often? no? a well it was worth a try. neway had a very gd day today wif the summerscheme at church. the kids are all gd...well saving of course the group that im landed wif. 5 eight year old boys who cartainly have been eating there weetabix for breakfast...can't wait until streamvale farm and tryin to keep an eye on them. a well as i said the rest are a good bunch though i have been given nicknames such as ugly bugly...sarah (explaniation later) and piggy bak girl. yeah id better explain now i spose. i have to play a woman in the dramas again (am i being typecast?) and i keep on gettin asked if i&nbsp;have pierced ears cause i wear earings. EVER HEARD OF CLIPONS! opk thats gonna draw ppls attention more than i want...a well its good fun though i got soaked today thanx to steve...shoulda seen it coming i spose.    &nbsp;  well feeling much better since last blog due to the luverly dr steele...no comment. hehe. got anofer text from hte mysterious h today...how hard is it to write ur name once in a while so i can work out who u r!! though i must admit im pretty sure its the butler formerly known as hannah. lol for some reason that reminded me that i wanna write my story...or at least start it this summer. Luckily from my last post anofer of my projects has taken off a bit. I can play 3 chords now! be proud! violin and piano are plodding along...but i need to get that violin piece and some rosin grrrrr i must go into town. though im booked up for next few days wif first the summer scheme, then hp wif peter on mon (lol cant wait hes such a gd laugh!!) and hopefully footie on tuesday.  &nbsp; ur luki i havnt given out many of my philosophies on life yet bvtw, but ive been too happy for a while to philosophise i spose. does that say sumfin bout the art? meh dunno! though i must admit i seem to have had god on my side more than ever recently...literally! rite im gonna go off now...ill write a post on montys baord (aka phil btw) cause hes gettin a lil touchy bout it...check it out btw for some good outlooks on life. ill start to do that on my blog soon but im tryin to work out wether this is a diary or not...mayb ill keep some philosophy for montys blog...utterpointlessness.blogspot.com go c! &nbsp; ttly and keep dreaming &nbsp; Duff

						   G'day. Good to be here again.  I'm wondering whether or not its a good idea to publish these posts? hmmm maybe i just won't wirte everything in them then! starting to look forward to Limerick a lot after the meeting last night. lol very studpidly though i have to try and learn guiter after saying "O i can learn guitar by Friday," making a complete ass of myself in the process and seemingly inflating my head by a notch or two...grrrrrrr. still doing drama down there so it can't b a bad thing!! cept that im a woman again in one of the mini playlets...i think im starting to be typecast.  What else is happening? well i wont see rach, rach, aaron and han again until i come back which is a bit annoying...but hopefully im going to c HP at last with peter sometime. good guy is peter. looking forward to london next year with the chapel choir, should b a blast...lol. and talking about the choir my sis finally confirmed that she had payed her way there! thank goodness, shes not even in the country and yet she manages to keep life interestin at home! still i think mum was a lil OTT. meh and im finally going to the doctors...wont reveal much to anyone who doesnt know wot for...suffice to say i need to get better. oooo andrea bocelli just came on media player...i c wot mum means about him. I'd better remind her to phone the odyssey to get tickets for november.  thought: wot does she actualy think of me? its very annoying when u try to work out wot ppl really think of ya...hmmmmmm.  dream: im getting guitar started at last thats mine for the day! and i still have the script close beside me! hehe  ill sign off for now...cya round and ill write later  Duff

						   heck ill do it now! London was fab but very hot i couldn't get to sleep at nights. all the heat rose up to our room in the hotel grrrrrrr. lol a well day times was much easier. im not gonna do this in any order just how i remember it. blood brothers as i said was fab, it was just so energetic and powerful. its one of the best stories ever written. on the table rox "devils got your number..." the music works so well and every1 just gave it their all. every time i come out of a show i just wanna do more and more acting! shoes  i dunno wot to think its so annoyin, its so hard to take up as a profession and would i enjoy it? i dunno but for now i still love it. meh neway that was when we met up wif kt for a very belated 19th as she has been travelling around Europe for 3 weeks...luki for some, eh:P?  thats a point i went over to see the choir lol! they did rock immensly, i cant wait to do it next tear. unfortunatly by the time both serivices came round i was too tired to appreciate them fully. though it was brill when the words "and the lord spoke out of heaven" (or sumfin to that effect) and there was a loud clap of thunder...lol mother nature has a good sense of timing. still the singing was defnitely as good as i've heard them before, lol the standard might well drop next year when all the sixth years leave and we join up. a well i just hope i get to go to westminster at least. o and i mite get to go and sing wif the vienna boys choir in june! i feel so bad cause i didnt win any of the competitions but i get to reep the rewards...a well im not gonna turn it down!  Also went to Kew and Osterly while i was there. Really nice gardens and got swamped by Canada gesse in the later during lunch...lol then i tried to b artistic in my photo takin...well ill c soon enuff if it worked:P. but kew was gorg and i loved just sittin by the lake watchin the world go past...until from nowhere a cockney voice boomed out. lol i realised they have the most annoyin accent in the world. ever. meh they went away soon enuff. urm think thats pretty much it for london. apart from shrek 2 of course...jsut as good the second time. it sjust soo good! i think im goin wif peter and few ofer people to c it again on sat, then bak to his for donny darko. lol it sounds really good, but reeeeeally weird. jessica loves it a lot, actually thats how i heard mad world first, she sent me it form the soundtrack so it must b good!  ooo how could i forget Chappells! best music shop in london accordin to dad and it was pretty darn good! got myself the music from recovering the satellites, i giorni and farewell to stromness. all piano but then again violin was either tutorials or wayyyyy to hard, but admittidly i looked in piano more. though i would wait to my bday to play them, but dad let me take them now if i wanted so i did lol i have no patience. i giorni is so amazin lol and i can play it! its werid it just sorta worked like no ofer piece has worked for me b4...havin said that ill prob go down now and not paly a note but i dont care its music from the heavens! lol Einaudi rocks beyond belief.  that moves me quite well onwards actually lol. isle of wight and rocks hehe-its a geology thing. spent a lot of the time movin from beach to beach lookin a the geology and searchin for any fossils. but the rock there is so weird cause it so soft. you could just lift a clump of rock from the face of a cliff wif ease, and then have the cliff fall on top of you lol but still. managed to find a few thigns of interest neways and the last beach, Whale Chine, was the devil to get down to but the most beautiful place i saw on the island. lol took lots of pics neways.  urm part from beaches etc went to a dinosaur farm which was really good cause it was shoesting bidget but really interestin, urrm spent lots of time wif lyndsey (mums old skool friend) hubbie rupert and marcus who came bak from an "interetsin" trip to serbia. got on really well wif them all but rupert was so funny and brillant. hes a cartoonist and i was brought up on his joke book lol, so now u know who to blame. must be tough for him though cause works har dto come by. a well he seems to manage. neways we spent a few eveinings at their house and got tea and cake!!!! YAY! lol how many times thave u had it recently, be honest:P.  aaaaaaaa and then there was mike the hotellier. lolno sooner were we in the door, and he was up in our rooms askin us what we wanted for brekkers the next mornin. but then he might nopt be there to serve it to us cause he did his back in liftin up a case, but never fear carol (his sister in law) will b there if he isnt. and he got pill sfrom the doctor. great guy. lol and he rung a gong to bring us down to breakfast. as rupet said, "he runs a tight ship does mike". hehe he rocked too! best thing bout the hotel was i i got my own room...and double bed...heaven lol. plently of time to read and listen to music which sometimes managed to keep  me sane. o and i have reaquainted myself wif PG Wodehouse...simply the best comic author to grace the earth, stabtastic! lol weirdly enuff i had very weird dreams each nite, lol only weird cause i havnt remembered any dreams recently lol. just a point. lol and plently of time to think about stuff too. lol holidays let u think about stuff which u find too hard or confusin at home cause your in a strange surroundin. trouble is i need to stop thinkin sumtime and start doin. hmmm lol there are some ppl i think i wanna tlk to lol but i need to get some things sorted first. meh. lol All my sons also became re-re-reaquainted wif...again. lol its such a good play. but i dont think i would care even if it wasnt cause ive got the itch back. i have been deprived of drama for too long! i reeeeeeally wanna get Chris but as long as i get in i dont mind...too  much:P. i do have a 5 in 6 chance though so im kinda thinkin i have a chance neways.  wel there you go the whole scandal written in full...yes...o that a point i need to write a novel...hm mayb i should start now lol...meh got a party to go to and i need to get mark a pressie...crap i have a hour...id betetr go lol!  well at least i cant say my life is borin!
