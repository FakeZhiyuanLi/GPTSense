      hey to everyone out there who has managed to find this blogspot. I will be posting any news of my student exchange to America here so keep looking for news as I wont be able to send messages to everyone except if i keep them really short.  Let me give you a run down on whats happening.  I'm leaving on the 7th of August, 2004 to Nashville, Tenessee(in the mid south of the USA) for a 5 month exchange program. I'm staying with 'The Pitts', Ginny and Greg Pitt and I'll be going to East Literature Magnet High School. I'll be getting back on about the 7th of January unless I get to stay in Chicargo for a week or so.  I made the first phone call to the Pitts today. Has anyone heard the way that someone from deep south America talks? well it was so hard to understand them at first and they found it hard to understand me. Both of us ended up talking really slowly and loudly and by the end of the 5 min conversation we had basically said hi, how excited we were, what the weather was like and goodbye. Still it was good to put a voice to a name.  I will keep you updated on the exchange more regularly once it actually begins.

      Guns are everywhere over here!  I went to the mall the other day and there was this shop called the outdoor shop which i went into and they have an entire counter for guns! This counter is split up into sections for pistols, single round rifles, automatic rifles, single shot spread, pump action, alternative weapons, pepper spray, ect.   Its kinda scary though when they have a video that is on a continuous loop that has things on it like the proper way to enter a room with certain types of weapons, the best weapon for defending your home, which weapon is suitable around children for defence, what to do if your partner (wife) is scared of having a gun in the house, and that pepper spray is only to be used as a deterant on dogs ro as a distraction as you pull out a bigger gun than your attacker has got pointed at you .  It seems silly to me to sell guns to people and then sell more guns to people to protect themselfs from the people who just bought guns but thats America for you.

      i am write this blog after having been confused with a 36 hour Saturday and suffering from jetlag and a cold fron the new polins on a 30 degree day.  i am finally in Nashville TN and its a really pretty place. Everything is green and fresh unlike the brown stuff in Aus at the moment.  the water really does go down the toilet in the opposite direction!  Everyone here is very nice and welcoming and i am able to understand at least half of the things that they say. i never knew i could speak american.  If anyone ever goes to LA airport then i suggest that they ask someone who knows what they are talking about for directions. (this excludes other passengers, police, customs officers, flight attendents, check-in and check-out staff, cab drivers, bus drivers, information desk staff and buskers. about the only thing that knows how to get from terminal 4 to terminal 1 is a map and even then it takes about half an hour.  im going to bed.
