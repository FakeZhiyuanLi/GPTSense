      sup yo.  saturday night was funny/fun/cool. (i had a part-ay.) and i'm pretty sure it rocked... i hope everyone else thinks that...  ok so my night:  first, vanessa came over at like 7, and she played with bob. (bob is my puppet thing... he's cool.) so that took place for like 5 minutes, and then we went downstairs to wait for all the guys to come. when mike, mark and evan finally got here, i took them on a tour of my house.. it was funny. cuz i kept trying to show them different things, and they'd get distracted by something else... yeah. it was funny. moving on... then tim got here, and then ray came and we went for a walk in the forest behind my house, cuz they wanted to see the tree house that was there... so then we got to the tree house, and hung out there a bit... and when i say hung, i mean ray got stuck and was kind of hanging there.. it was funny. yeah they got bored of that after about 5 minutes, and after we got ray down we went to the rope swing... and that is where all the fun began!  we were taking turns swinging on the rope swing, and we saw this guy in the bushes, like watching us. so mike, ray, and evan started making bird noises, and then guy in the bushes did it back... only his bird noises were pro. seriously, i was scared. but then he eventually came out of the bushes, and he hung out with us... he's a cool guy. his name's donovan... and i think he kind of likes mike.  so after our little trip to the rope swing, we went to the park, and ray again got stuck. after rescuing him  yet again , we walked back to my house, and waited for erin to arrive, and started to watch gothika... then erin came like just after i put the movie in, so we all watched it together... minus the fact that evan, ray and mike kept going into the kitchen and trying to scare us.  at one of the scary parts of the movie, ray and mike snuck outside, went to the back of my house (where the window of the living room is), and knocked on the window. of course, you can predict what happened next... people screamed and ran, there was mass confusion, and then we realized that it was them... and all the other guys were like "oh man i knew it was them! i wasn't scared at all."...liars.  so yeah. when the movie was done, we just chilled yo. it was coo. and then people started to leave... and then came the best part ever... i got to clean up. yeah, i know. amazing.  quotes from last night:  "wouldn't that be funny if we all turned into praying mantises?"-mike (so random.)  *Donovan makes loon sound.* "sorry, i don't speak loon."-evan  "hey ray you have to see the huge basement!"-evan, as he runs into the study. "...wrong way..."-me   *bollywood music*-evan, mike, ray... every 5 seconds.  wow they were so funny ahaha i laughed... here's how:  1. evan put a basket on his head, and an umbrella in his hand, and ran around my house. 2. mike, evan and ray poked their heads around a corner and made random noises. 3. evan tried to convince us that there was a little girl sitting in my background... he kind of failed miserably. 4. there's a that runs along the stairs, but he like goes straight across and it's really high up... and the three of them tried to go across it... again, they failed.  yes, that was saturday night... i'm so gonna do that again... and ray had an idea to watch a scary movie, and then go play manhunt at like 11 in the dark forest. sounds like a plan, stan.  ok so today was kind of cool... minus the fact that it rained, and i kind of had a seizure... but that's a story for another time, kids.  *during art class, when mr. olsen was trying to get people to evaluate a painting... it was of a woman and a chicken.* "so tell me guys, what are the shapes in this painting?"-mr. olsen "... chicken "-adam (grade 11 gangster guy... he's coo.) "no, adam, what are they types of shapes?"-mr. olsen "... chicken "-adam "no what types of shapes are they!? organic or geometric?"-mr. olsen "... chicken... "-adam wow it was hilarious.. cuz adam wouldn't stop saying chicken. so eventually mr. olsen wrote chicken on the board to make him happy. yeah, it=good times.

      hey duuuudes.  last night rocked my pants off. why? because erin slept over, of course. it was so much fun... seriously. she's such a cool cat... she's uber funny too. she came over at like 6:30, and while we were waiting for my mum to finish making dinner my brother's band played for us... it was pretty rawesome. they took 747503 years to set up their equipment though... it was funny to watch. and then we ate dinner (pasta and tomato sauce, avec garlic bread. sweet.), and then we went for a walk through the woods behind my house... it was frikin funny. we walked to this tree house (which sucked penis, by the way), and i tried to climb the tree to get to it... but the steps sucked ass too. [so really it was a pretty shitty tree house... i'm so gonna make a better one in the summer. who's with me? yes? yes? no.] so yeah, there was this tree near the tree house, and it was perfect for writing on... so erin wrote "fort susk my penis". i think she meant to put "fort sucks my penis", minus the c... yeah, erin's challenged. aha while erin was carving that in the tree, we heard thing falling in the forest... like rocks or something. so we got kind of freaked out, and i thought someone was throwing stuff at us, but erin said there was no one there. but then i saw this person in the distance, and he looked like he/she was like 10 years old. so i started watching him/her (turned out to be a him), and yeah he was throwing rocks at us. i have no idea why... it's wierd. so we like started following him, but he got away on a bike (sneaky bastard...). so then we sat on these rocks and waited for them to come back, but they didn't... so erin walked like 10 steps, and she saw him. and she was like yelling insults at him... it was kind of funny, cuz like i said... he was like 10 years old. but he was kind of a potty mouth...  "hey, nice shot buddy!"-erin, as the guy was throwing rocks at us. "suck my ass, bitch!"-10 year old...asshole.  ahaha. funny kid.  so yeah... after our encounter with the kiddy-wink, we went back to my house and listened to music and talked and went on MSN until my parents went to bed at like 10.. then we watched thirteen and the texas chainsaw massacre... ahaha funny stuff... times 57385. here is just a taste of our awesome sleepover.  "you pushed me to the edge... you pushed me to the edge"- erin, like 47827 times trying to sing along with my brother's band.    "Do it"-guy in texas chainsaw massacre "I CANT!"-girl in texas chainsaw massacre "just do it.. get the knife..."-guy "oh alright"-girl  "want some POOTANG PIE?"- erin, so randomly.  *erin having a siezure while reanacting bloody romance by senses fail*   "If you're havin' girl problems i feel bad for ya son, i got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one.. hit me!"-me, like 538437 times while we were walking through the forest.  "the texas chainsaw massacre"-me and erin in a funny accent, after watching the previews. you definetely had to be there for that one, because obviously i can't do the accent on here.  wow i had a great time... we went to bed at like 2. (i know what you're thinking: "you rebels, you.") it was awesome. and i'm having a part-ay tonight... should be sweet. minus the fact that i'm scared...  k well i'm gonna go get prepared for the shin-dig. ciao. (wow, that's so gino.)  make the same mistake twice. burst of red and green all over me brings the things that she'll love- i should let it form over.  kayte.   p.s. liz, i love you.

      hey dudes.  today was alright... some exciting/fun stuff happened. we had what i like to call a fair at lunch today. it was coo. they were selling hotdogs, giving people free cake, playing music (shitty rap/r&b stuff, may i add), and they had one of those things, like the bouncy castle things but it was an obstacle course, and you had to race your friend or whatever. yeah i dunno what i'm trying to say. ahaha tim fell off it! ahaha... he was running at the beginning, and he tried to jump on to these step-like things, but he kind of missed and fell off the whole bouncy thing. and landed with a thump. ahaha everyone was watching too... poor guy.  *erin buying a hotdog.* "beef or pork?"-hotdog guy "beef... or pork..."-erin  "..."-hotdog guy  "hey look, an electric eraser!"-tim "yeah, it's pretty cool."-me "now i'm going to erase you!"-tim, as he turns on the eraser and tries to erase himself.  "tap. thrust. tap tap. thrust."-vanessa, sylvia and i in gym class.(we did some actions to it too. t'was fun.)  "see, this is how grade 7's dance!"-em, as she stands like 2845937 feet away from me, and puts her fingertips on my shoulders, as i put my fingertips on her hips. "and this is how grade 9's dance."-em, as she practically rapes me. i enjoyed it...  "my heart bleeds no more!"-erin, trying to be screamo.  "have you ever heard of alexisonfire?"-me "no, but have you heard of poursomewateronhimthen?"-joby  "i hate laundry... it scares me."-ray  wow. i saw "you know who" today... he was looking pretty fine. but i'm kind of confused, cuz he was wearing a different shirt this afternoon than he was this morning... no, i'm not stalking him. ok yes i am. erin thinks he's tiny and he walks funny... even though the first part isn't really true. neither is the second part though, come to think of it. buuuut... she sucks.  aaah this weekend is still gonna be semi-awesome... minus the fact that i'm not going to the effing concert anymore... *cough*i hate you alex*cough*. buuut erin's coming over on friday night for a sleepover, and i'm getting SO psyched about saturday night! (my part-ay.) it will be coo.  k well i'm gonna go now... paice.  that mistake was gold- i know that without you, it's something that i could never do. kayte.

      i f-cking HATE alex. HATE.  HATE!  ugh. yeah me=not going to that amazing concert anymore. why? oh because alex decided to f-cking SELL his tickets to someone on e-bay...loser.  well, now that i've got that out of my system...today was suck-y. a perfect end to the weekend/start to the week. or not.  found out some more bad news... not gonna share it cuz i'm not supposed to know. and the person(s) might read this. so you'll never know. muahahaha...ha... and i'm done.  we had a pep rally today... barely anyone went. it sucked ass, no offence to those people who were in it. it was like half an hour long, and had really NO point. at all.  k... so no quotes from today... except these:  *as erin eats her sandwich... during geography class.* "hey, mrs. sandwich! put that away!"-mr. eccles *laughs hysterically for 2 minutes.*-erin "why are you like this?"-mr. eccles and then they argued about the fact that erin's apparently always eating in class. plus the not...  "hey, wouldn't it be funny if i threw this really hard ball at your face? and then you'd have to get plastic surgery on your nose."-chelsea "...she already does."-me then vanessa beat me... minus the beating. she actually yelled at me... and yes. it was coo.  "so... about those mets..."-me "what's a met?"-evan ahaha that JUST happened. i laughed out loud. *all you people out there who are reading this are probably thinking "hey, what IS a met?!" props to you guys...p.s. it's a baseball team.*  k so i didn't take the bus this morning... cuz my mum gave me a ride, so i didn't see "you know who"...it's funny cuz most of you don't actually know who. he goes to ross... and he has a lip ring... and he's hot. enough said. wow i'm bored times 274937. i should be doing my homework... buuuuut i'm not. i'll do it later... or not. hey i just thought of something exciting that happened today. we had a firedrill! i know. pretty awesome, eh? [not.] i was standing outside with mike g, listening to his MD. it was coo.  *after standing outside for about 10 minutes after the fire alarm rang.* "hey, was that the fire alarm?!"-mike. ahaha then i made fun of him... he's a good guy.  weeeeeell i'm kind of tired of blogging now... and i have nothing else to say.  from throat and eyes came winter and reasons- i'm told to carry on.  kayte.

      k so it really couldn't get any worse. actually, it could... and it probably will, but will it make a difference? no. i'm kind of hating my life right now... not that anyone really cares. but i am. i really have nothing else to say on this subject.  k the rest of this blog will be dedicated to liz. she's so cool, and she always has the right thing to say. i.e.: "i will slit her throat, cut her open and play with her ovaries." "she looks like a llama." "i tell her that she's not funny everyday... and she still thinks i'm kidding?"  liz. i [heart] you. thanks for always trying to make me feel better about... stuff... please forgive me if i got any of those quotes slightly wrong (i probably did...). you're always there for me to talk to in math class, and you always have good advice. thanks times 37568942.  ...i'm outtie now.  when love reached beneath her plaid jumper, pulled out a switch blade and drove it... directly through the heart of st angeles.  kayte.

      whaddup gangstas. k so i'm really tired... so this blog prolly won't make sense.  tonight was cool-ish. and when i say cool-ish, i mean i loved the part where me, vanessa and sylvia chilled- but hated the part where everything started to go wrong... obviously: k so i went to vanessa's house at like 7... and then we walked to sylvia's, and she showed us her room. it was hot. then we walked for like 2749475 hours. first, we went to tim horton's, and i got 3 donuts (woooooot), and then we sat there for like 10 minutes, while these insane guys looked at us. i felt uncomfortable. but then we left... and it had started to rain. but we kept walking for another 38394 hours. we went to call on people, but sadly... no one was home. so there we were, walking around in the rain... walking up to peoples' houses, and being let down each time by the fact that people have lives. and then we like ran to vanessa's house... and when i say ran, i mean walked. duh. and then we stayed there for like... 10 minutes. and she got changed. and me and sylvia watched. then we went outside again... where it was raining- again. we went to mac's, bought like 3 pieces of candy, and then walked back to vanessa's. (by that time, it was f-cking pouring.) and we were soaked... and that's when things started going downhill... [bruce] most likely likes [ethel], so i hate my life. yeah. not kidding. so that was my night... and then my brother picked me up. and his friends were in the car... and he was being an asshole cuz he was trying to be cool in front of them. he pulled the car over (on the effing hanlon), and pretended to be serious when he told me to walk the rest of the way home. but i didn't. and then he made me cry... i was pissed. aand theeeeen when i got home, i went on msn. and he went out again briefly, and then when he came home he hugged me and apologized. everything's coo now. minus the fact that my life is ruined.  funny quotes that happened tonight:  "i hate you. and then there was this one time..."-vanessa, imitating mike g. (long story.)  *random cat noises*-sylvia  k really there were so many more... really. but i'm tired/can't think.   wow i=suck big time at blogging.  ...and i'm spent.  just think of this and me as just a few of the many things to lay around and clutter up your shelves. kayte.

      sup guys.  i'm bored. and i have no life. hence the blog... it will be about nothing in particular. k so i just wanted to say: ERIN YOU'RE A COPIER. s'right. haha i'm semi-kidding. cuz you said "over and out" in your blog... liz says that. and you made a blog... after liz did. and you say "ooh heeeeey duuuuude", which jeff made up. and you said "me=suckage", which everyone knows i made up. (am i starting to sound like evan yet? haha). and i'm done. i still [heart] you.  k so obviously my descreteness is bad. you remember my story about [bruce] and [ethel] at the dance? ray figured out who they are. and it didn't even take him a long time...frik.  wahoo. 5 days. i'm getting so psyched. and erin had better be too. p.s. erin, you didn't mention me in your blog yet. but you mentioned cody like 274927494 times. i hurt.  guys... i woke up at 12:01 today- that's frikin crazy talk. i surprised myself. haha like 2 minutes after i woke up, my dad said we were going out for lunch. so i got ready in like... 20 minutes. props.  ugh i hate llamas. really. they're so stupid and UGLY. but IF someone happened to buy me one, or i inherited one or something... i'd name it ethel. that kinda relates back to my [bruce] and [ethel] story. liz knows what i'm talking about.  k since i'm such a loser, i have no plans tonight... anyone? anyone at all? no? ok.  peace out homies.  but sometimes its just about feeling good- like John Kusac and pop punk. kayte.

      sup.  so tonight was cool. went to vanessa's house at 7:30, and then em came over at like 7:45... and we chilled yo. em straightened my hair for me... it looked so good! wow i love her/her straightener. and then i kind of straightened vanessa's hair... but i'm not pro enough. the part i did sucked... but then em fixed it. so it was all good in tha hood. props. so yeah, after our "straightening party", timmy came over. he was our pimp for the night;). and we watched like not even half of Jurassic Park... cuz it was the only thing that was on TV... and em was getting scared so we turned it off. and then we walked to tim horton's... and on the way, em and tim left us. to have sex. [i made that part up. but they really did leave us.] so me and ness went to tim horton's by ourselves... and when we got there, my brother and his friends were there. including the hot one. he was hot. so then my brother drove vanessa home, and [the hot one] came with us. and then i pissed my brother off and he almost made me walk... but hey, it provided some entertainment for vanessa. she laughed for like a minute, but tried not to cuz she wanted [the hot one] to think she was sexy. (i think it worked.) and yes. that was my night... and then my brother and [the hot one] drove me home. it was fun.  k so no plans for tomorrow/tomorrow night. i wanna hang out with "delenda" cuz they're cool cats. but they prolly don't want to/are busy.  and i'm done... cuz vanessa is getting impatient. (she wants to read this. she has no life...don't worry vanessa. i still love you.  k. i'm outtie. paice out home dogs.  you had the best damn sunday dress at the end of the world. kayte.

[note: they suck at writing songs. sorry guys.]  so. i have plans for tonight. i'm so happy. with my lovers: vanessa and em. they rock. we're going to tim horton's... but no one else is gonna be out cuz chelsey's having a party... and everyone else is invited.  ok so next weekend is gonna be sweet.

      wow guys, since i'm so cool, i thought i'd create a blog. it's what everyone's doing now... so here it is. you must be excited to read it.  well, since people usually write about their day in these things, and considering it's pretty early in the morning and nothing has happened so far... i think i'll just put some quotes from yesterday. woot.  -while the class was playing pictionary- "why are you drawing that?"-Hannah, to Mr. Eccles "because...*says something under his breath*-Mr. Eccles "did you just say you have gum on your panda?"-Hannah *Erin laughs for literally 5 minutes. and gets the whole class laughing with her laugh. but then people started to get annoyed with her, especially Mr. Eccles. but not me. i love Erin.*  ahaha everyone in geography knows what i'm talking about. for all of you other people out there, you suck for not being there.  -in gym class, playing 4-corner soccer- "hey guys, who's our goalie?!"-Anna "no one's allowed to be a goalie"-Katrina "no guys where's our goalie?!"-Anna *Anna runs toward the net, some how manages to trip over her own feet, falls head first into it. laughs for 2 minutes.*  "oh but it would be so romantic if me and him were going out when we go to Quebec... we would walk through the museums together..."-Jessica "oh yeah, you know... those museums are so romantic..."-me "no but imagine this! we'd be walking through one of the museums together, and we'd stop behind the rock display. and we'd kiss."-Jessica "the rock display? i'm sorry, i just got a mental picture of you two being behind a huge boulder kissing. how romantic...?-me "Kate, it would be romantic! can't you imagine it?"-Jessica "yeah, and i hope your mental image is more romantic than the one i have."-me i thought that was funny... i guess you  had to be there though. yeah my quote-making skills suck ass. but hey, what can you do?  "ooooh heeeey duuuude"-Erin, 3479472947 times everyday.  hey guys, frikin 6 days!!!!! aaah. i'm SO psyched. for those of you who don't know what i'm talking 'bout, me and Erin are going to the blink-182/the used/taking back sunday concert in the t dot on Friday. yeah, s'right. my parents are so awesome... they're going to go out for dinner in Toronto that night just so they can drive us there and back. i love.  "dad... someone i know is selling 2 tickets for a concert... $200 for both. but the thing is, i asked Erin if her parents would buy one, and she said probably not. so could you buy both?" "no. i'm going to have to put my foot down on this one. i'm not going to pay $100 for one of your friends to go to a concert... if it was me or your mum going with you, then i would buy both."-dad "but neither you or mum would want to go! it's screamo, and the singer of the used throws up when he's on stage."-me "i don't mind you going to a concert where people throw up. it's not that, i just think Erin should pay for her own ticket."-dad eventually, the guy selling the tickets lowered the price, Erin's mum said she could go, and my parents said i could go if she goes. sweet. my dad is so awesome.  ok so nothing else to tell.  oh wait... there was a dance on Thursday night. yeah i=didn't go. cuz i have no life and i did homework all night. but at 7:30, Vanessa called me from the dance. and she said i had to come because [bruce](not his real name, obviously) was there. and [ethel] (not her real name, obviously) was there too. [ethel] likes [bruce]. and so do i. so i cried... not really. so yeah i suck for not going... i totally regret it. not that [bruce] would have danced with me anyway.  k well i'm outtie yo. catch you on the flipside.  you had the best damn sunday dress at the end of the world. the wall of flames that consumed you and everything that was good, 'not with a band but a whimper'. kayte.

      hello.  yet another boring day to jump start the summer holiday...wow.  so, today, did nothing. the highlight of my day was writing a poem thing...and it's so cool. i'm so proud of it. so proud, in fact, that i shall write it out on hurr for all you people to see. p.s. please don't steal any lines/steal the whole thing without consulting me. as you will notice, at the bottom it is copyrighted. suckas. (not that you'll actually want to steal it...)   you called me from the deserted payphone, and told me about the gun in your hand. you expected me to feel sorry for you- even after everything you had done to me. the words ‘i’m so fucking sorry’ slipped from your lips with such ease- with such sincerity. why do i always give into you? maybe it’s the sound of your voice; maybe it’s the way my veins run dry when i’m not with you. i thought that maybe if we were together, then nothing could ever hurt me. but it was being with you that hurt me most- the cuts and bruises on my heart show that. but no matter how many times you batter and destroy me, I still manage to find my way back to you. ‘pull the fucking trigger’ are the only words i can find to say. and as i hear the gunshot on the other end of the receiver, the bullet goes through your heart and out through mine- ending this love forever.    -copyright, kate mckenna.  and there you have it. i hope you like it...cuz i sure do. and so do sofija and lana... so eff you if you don't.  ack tomorrow's canada day! sweet. i haven't been out of the house with my friends for  days . it shall be sweet...note to self: take money and camera. woot.  oh wow. waterwings is the best video ever...it's so sweet. and, if i haven't already mentioned this before, alexisonfire is my all time favourite band. (i've come a long way from despising them a couple of months ago.)  well, i'm out. paice.  embrace the emptiness. so let it enfold you.  kayte.  p.s. i'm sorry for my blogs sucking/being short just recently. they will get better, i promise. i just need to get some friends.

      hello.  yesterday was a cool day...but kindof boring. i went to the orthodontist at 11:50, then my mum took me to tim horton's for lunch, then we went to cambridge.  "thank you!"-me, after my mum bought me lunch. "no no, thank  you ."-mum. "for what? the pleasure of my company?"-me. "uh...no."-mum.  then after all that jazz in cambridge, i went on msn and watched tv for like the whole afternoon...then i had dinner avec ma famille. it was sweet, because they're cool.   oh my god.  i hate my brother. k, here's the story. my dad has a friend in australia (in canberra, to be exact), and he works at the business school. my brother, who's going back to high school for one semester in september, got an offer from my dad's friend to go work at the business school in canberra for the second semester next year.  IN AUSTRALIA. FOR A SEMESTER.  fuck. what a lucky guy.  "do they have, you know, electricity down there?"-my brother.  "so uh... how much money would i be earning?"-my brother. "i think about $16-20 an hour."-my dad. "are you joking? screw my job. i'm going down there to work for a semester with him."-my mum.

      hello.  today was a cool day...but kindof boring. i went to the orthodontist at 11:50, then my mum took me to tim horton's for lunch, then we went to cambridge.  "thank you!"-me, after my mum bought me lunch. "no no, thank  you ."-mum. "for what? the pleasure of my company?"-me. "uh...no."-mum.  then after all that jazz in cambridge, i went on msn and watched tv for like the whole afternoon...then i had dinner avec ma famille. it was sweet, because they're cool.   oh my god.  i hate my brother. k, here's the story. my dad has a friend in australia (in canberra, to be exact), and he works at the business school. my brother, who's going back to high school for one semester in september, got an offer from my dad's friend to go work at the business school in canberra for the second semester next year,

      hello ladies and gents.  here i am, alone again. that happens a lot...and i'm scared again. cuz i keep hearing noises...even though i know nothing's gonna happen. wow it's funny cuz i'm 14 years old, and i'm scared of being home alone.  so erin came over tonight... we watched  scary movie 3  on pay per view, and erin was entertaining my brother's friends (who were over, obviously) with her laugh. it was sweet. then my brother and his friends went out, erin went on my computer in my room and i went on the one in the study, and we talked to eachother on msn. it was sweet. then i got hungry, so i went to look for money that i could use to order pizza or something... i found $70, but it was in my mum's purse so i didn't want to take it. so then i decided to make sandwiches... they rocked, if you ask me. (this was at like 10:00... it was sweet). then we watched  blind date , and we waited for erin's sister to come pick her up. and here i am.  so plans for tomorrow=going to lana's house. (hopefully.) she got her pictures from her party developed already.. i can't wait to see them.  ack so july 1: me, lana, erin, and bunch of other people are going to the canada day celebrations... i hope it will be sweet...and if it isn't? who cares.  wheew ok so i'm bored. no one's on msn... cuz you guys suck.  for the record: mike chaulk and erin tusa rock at writing poems... i wish i had as much talent as them. seriously... you guys should do it for a living.  k, so i need a new hair cut/style. suggestions?   it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:  what is up my home dog?  And we'll take a ride, in my car filled with knives, into the red sunset we'll go... with no seatbelts on says:  nothing my home iguana   sofija says:  NOW I GET IT!!!!! DQ=Dairy Queen= the queen of dairy.. like... milk stuff, and ice cream  sofija says:  OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  sofija says:  i thought it was just a random name someone thought of.  wow. i really  do  suck at this blogging thing... so i'm out.  i know you well enough to know, you never loved me.  kayte.  p.s. since i'm so cool/my blog was short, i shall write out the lyrics to a song. and go.   you kiss your life goodbye, like lovers in the night. returning home alone, as if you suffered a heart attack. and under the weight of the world that nearly broke your back- it was written on your face... i could see it in your face. congratulations. today is another day. it's coming crashing down to break you again. congratulations. you can change. sometimes, when lying on your back, you learn to breathe again. black out your bitterness- forget your jaded bliss. your shadow falls on me... you blame it all on a mutiny. when everybody around you always seem so free- i can see it in your eyes... it's burning in your eyes. congratulations. today is another day. it's coming crashing down to break you again. congratulations. you can change. sometimes, when lying on your back, you learn to breathe again. nothing left to lose- there's nothing left to lose. congratulations. today is another day. it's coming crashing down to break you again. congratulations. you can change. sometimes, when lying on your back, you learn to breathe again. there's nothing left to lose.    congratulations , the juliana theory.

      oh hello. fancy meeting you here.  i haven't blogged since...well, yesterday. but it wasn't really about my day... so hurr we go.  yesterday, was boring. woke up at like 10:30, (the usual time), went on msn, and then...i had the best idea. i thought "hey kate, since you're so awesome and your friends are the coolest people in the world, you could make a collage on your wall out of all the pictures of friends you have!". so i did just that. it looks so awesome... it's sweet. it's kindof almost done. i'm excited.  so after making my collage thingy, i asked some people to come over... but, because i suck and live a 15 minute drive away from everybody, no one could come. so i was home alone till 12:30 last night. (my mum was working, my dad's in australia, and my brother has a social life.) i kept hearing voices/noises...erin says they were all in my head. great, so now i'm crazy. woot. oh, here is ray's way of comforting me:   Ray says:   what was that noise?  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   aha!  Ray says:   it came from upstairs  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   aha oh that would be the rapist hiding in your closet.  Ray says:   no i heard it come from your house  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   RAY SHUT UP!  Ray says:   uh oh  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   ray i'm gonna start crying.  Ray says:   i think he's coming down  it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying- it's funny how clean your life gets from dying. says:   SHUT UP!  Ray says:   dun dun  Ray says:   dun   aha he's cool though... even though i was scared and he was being a meany. oh, and right before he logged off, he said: "have fun. and look out behind you."  i bet you can imagine how comforted that made me feel! thanks bud.  so that was yesterday. today, i woke up at 12:30! it was crazy talk. so i went on msn till my brother woke up and kicked me off, then i worked on my collage again till like 3:30. then i had a bath, erin called, i invited her over... and now i'm waiting for her to get hurr. sweet.  well i'm outtie yo. paice playa.   these words they choke me-  they resonate in my heart.

        we lit the match, dropped it, and waited- just to see how beautiful,  and painful it could be. it's funny how clear your eyes get from crying; it's funny how clear your life gets from dying. you know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. all we want is shelter, from the times that bring us down. you know you sleeves are long,  waiting on an answer- just to be protected, from the doubt that's in our heart. been at the bottom, soared to the sun. just to see how beautiful, and painful it could be. wings that were ours, broken from trying; wings that were ours, melted from flying. you know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. all we want is shelter, from the times that bring us down. you know you sleeves are long,  waiting on an answer- just to be protected, from the doubt that's in our heart. you know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. all we want is shelter, from the times that bring us down. you know you sleeves are long,  waiting on an answer- just to be protected, from the doubt that's in our heart.    - walking wounded , the beautiful mistake.  kayte.

      hellooooooo.  aaaah tonight was AMAZING. frik. seriously,  best night of my life. (i love how i say that about lots of my fun nights... but this time, i mean it!)  so it was lana banana's birthday... and delenda played! it was SO sweet. they played in her garage, and everyone was packed in there... we were standing like right next to the band members... and wow. it was amazing. they played some of their songs, but then they played  war all the time  by thursday,  you're so last summer  by taking back sunday,  187  and  bloody romance  by senses fail... they were all amazing! it was so good. [awesome job, guys! you rocked.]  so after delenda played, we ate pizza, had cake, and watched happy gilmore. it was so sweet... then lana gave the girls some pictures that she had taken at school. (i must admit, there were some pretty good ones of me! sweet.)  "anson, i love you!"-erin, like 27947 times tonight. most of which were while they were playing.  "goosefraba"-erin to evan. (he has anger problems.) "goose problems!?"-vanessa.  "evan, you have major anger problems..."-me *5 minutes later.* "calm down."-evan "don't tell me to f-cking calm down."-mark "aha and you say  i  have anger problems!"-evan.   confusion bleeds to vulture stares- conviction bleeds the silence here. says:  you will never guess who else was thurr.  and the value of destiny comes to nothing. says:  mmm..your right i wont! give me a clue.  confusion bleeds to vulture stares- conviction bleeds the silence here. says:  starts with "r" and ends with "ob".  and the value of destiny comes to nothing. says:  oh wow.  bad clue kate! i didnt even have to guess...it was rlkjlkjlkjlkjkob wasnt it?  "anson has swedish hair."-evan  aaah and while they were playing a song, mike dropped his pic... and me, being the awesome person i am, picked it up for him. (wow i touched a band member of delenda's guitar pic. wow. never washing my hand again...btw, i'm joking.)  so there were lots of people thurr tonight: lana. (obviously) sofija. erin. vanessa. emily. evan. mike. ray. mark. anson. marina. person i don't know #1. person i don't know #2.  it was coo. one of lana's friends that i don't know was all like ghetto...and he spoke spanish (as well as yugoslavian... cuz lana's yugoslavian) and he was speaking to erin in spanish... and she was laughing so hard. it was sweet.  ack there are quotes that i can't remember... cuz it was such a cool night.  but it's 20 to 1, so i'm gonna go now. paice.  i stay wrecked and jelous for this- for this simple reason.  kayte.

      why hello there.  today was sweet...kindof.  ok well first, i got woken up by sarah (my brother's friend) when she called at  9:30 . yeah. that's right. then, after having an hour of on-and-off sleep, my brother woke me up to tell me he was going out...which he really didn't need to do. cuz, you know, i was doing a little thing that we normal people like to call  sleeping . he and his friends should try it sometime.  so after my brother woke me up, i couldn't get back to sleep. so i went on msn for a bit, had breakfast, watched tv, did laundry, and cleaned my bathroom. (it was sweet.) then i took the bus to erin's house. when i got off my bus downtown, i saw monika and cassie, (oh, and then i saw you-know-who. he was hot). and then steph was on the bus to erin's house. so we talked and stuff...it was coo.  then i got to erin's house, and vanessa was thurr. and we went for a "dip" in erin's pool... then vanessa left, and me and erin talked/listened to music/went on msn/ate. then erin did my make-up, and i went home. via the bus. god i  hate  taking the bus! all the people on it are so evil... this girl was looking at me like the whole time... and she thought i didn't notice. she was judging me, and i didn't like it. and then, my frikin batteries died in my cd player... so i had to travel  without  music the rest of the way home. it sucked.  then my brother left again like 10 minutes after i got home, i ate dinner, and then i watched tv with my mummy when she got home from work (at like 8). so all in all, you're just another brick in the wall. sorry, that wasn't what i meant to say... i started to say "so all in all, it was a good day", but the song took over. sorry.  eeek. lana's party tomorrow! it's gonna be kick-ass. (cuz lana's hot.) me and erin are giong downtown tomorrow to get her a present... but where to go? are there any cool places [that don't sell drug paraphernalia] downtown that i could shop for a gift for anal? please tell.  well, it's 12:00...and i'm not gonna go to bed, but i'm gonna stop blogging.  which would you prefer? my finger on the trigger- or me face down across your floor?  kayte.

      hi-low.  what is up? wow last night and today=best days of my LIFE. woor.  went to the movies last night, with sofija, lana, ray, mike c, and evan. it was SWEET. saw dodgeball... best movie ever. so funny. (AAAAACK. the love of my life went to see the movie too. aah i was like FREAKING. but he doesn't know me/want to know me. frik.)  after the movie, lana went home, and me, sofija and the guys went to A&W, and the guys were making sofija almost piss herself... it was amazing. and since we're all SO cool, we hung (loitered) outside A&W till my brother picked me and sofo up. it was sweet.  today, i went to sofija's at like 8 (yeah that's right. in the  morning. ), lana came over, and we went to taylor evans to see the talent show! and i must admit, i was blown away. truly, madly, deeply. so after seeing dozens of people i've never seen in my life performing at t.e., lana went home, and me and sofija went to gateway! wow. it was so cool. we went when it was lunch time, so we got to see all the cool grade 8's. so since sofija had never been to/seen gateway (EVER), i gave her a tour. and we saw mr. creighton and he gave us chocolate... and it rocked. then we went to erin's house, but she wasn't home, and then we walked to tim horton's. i bought a sandwich, and sofija's friends from t.e. who we had seen that very morning were thurr. and we kindof chilled with them... but i felt out of place, cuz you know, i don't know them.  so after the tim horton's thing, we went back to gateway because sofija had a brilliant idea to give the jacket i was carrying to chelsea. then i wouldn't have to carry it anymore. so we did, but then she gave it back to me...frik. so then we talked to chelsea i swear for like half an hour. it was CRAZY. she's so cool... wow, i wish  i  was as cool as her when i was in grade 8. wow. and then i saw josh and matty and robert and austin for the first time in like 2 years (not really,  but it has been a long time).  so after being at gateway for 279472 hours, we went to ray's house, but he wasn't home, and then we went to mike's house. and me and mike sat and watched his dog lick sofija to death...and she liked it. a lot. it was kindof "sick". and then, after sofija went into mike's room and sprayed his bed with gross-smelling-stuff, we walked him to his band practise at anson's. awww.  and then, came a cool part of the adventure. WE GOT TO WATCH THEM PRACTISE. yeah. i know. it was amazing. we only got in after we begged evan and mike, and obviously after we asked anson. (p.s. anson=my new best friend. he rocks). but then, came the sad part. it took them like 10 minutes to set up, and 5 minutes to play one song, and since they had originally said we could only stay for 15 minutes, we were kicked out onto the street. and, in case you were wondering, i finally got rid of my jacket that was being a loser and that i had to carry. how? i left it at anson's house. *grins.*  so after being disowned by the guys, we walked  all the way back to sofija's house . and i met her mom. she's sweet.  oh, and then sofija walked me to the bus stop... but i missed it. twice. frik.  "hey there's the bus!"-me "aaaah run!"-sofija "no, i'll miss it!"-me "no you won't. he'll stop if he sees you running."-sofija *bus drives by as we run towards it. thanks.*  so i bought nerds to pass the time, and we ate them off the ground and waited (in the shade, thank god) until my bus came. it was sweet.  quotes from last night/today:  "what kindof burger do you want?"-sofija "i dunno, i'll share one with you."-me "ok. i want a grandpa."-sofija "ahah! just a grandpa, not a burger."-me "ahahaha! YES! omg i'm gonna go up there and ask for a grandpa!"-sofija  "my patience is like a pie.. its eaten quickly.. well .. at least in my family. well, no.. patience isn't eaten, it kind of.. disappears, like water evaporating, so it's not like a pie, at all."-sofija  "can we come to your band practise?"-sofija "no."-evan "fine. i'm never wearing my delenda shirt  again ."-sofija "fine! you're not our biggest fan anymore then. kate is!"-evan/mike "sweet!"-me *5 seconds later, after sofija cried in her corner.* "ok, you're our biggest fan again. sorry kate."-evan  "penis is such a funny word."-chelsea. oh man. you have much to learn... aha but you're awesome.  "omg if noah was here, i'd melt!"-me "omg so would i! i would melt into a puddle, and then everyone would slip on me."-sofija *demonstrates what people would look like if they were to slip on her, ends up kicking me instead.*-sofija  "wow. one of your friends said i had pretty eyes... woot. what a sweet day."-sofija  frik. there were so many other quotes... like from when we were sitting at galaxy waiting for the guys to come. it was amazing.  well, i'm off now. cuz i seriously suck at blogging, and need to keep a tape recorder on me or something to record all the things that people say. frik. why didn't i think of that before?  why?  because you suck, kate. you suck.  my life is not my own- it was bought for me.  kayte.

      hello.  today was the most boring day EVER.   woke up at 10. went on msn. ate lunch. had a shower. got dressed. went on msn. went grocery shopping with my mum. watched tv. went on msn. ate dinner. watched tv. went on msn.   wow. i bet you wish you had an exciting life like me. yeah. s'right.  "KATE HAS A PENIS NAMED NOAH!"-chloe. wow, best quote ever.  "what colour do you want your conversation box to be?"-me "black. no. orang. e. orang with an e."-chloe "ok. as apposed to the orange without an e..."-me  sofija drew me a picture today. it has a pair of pants (my pants) and it has a little boy sitting in the middle of them (around the crotch area, in case you were wondering). it represents noah being in my pants. but chloe came up with another interpretation for it: he is my penis. but you know, whichever works.  i made my mum buy fortune cookies today... wow they're the best things ever! but the fortunes sucked.  *opens fortune cookie* "'you will have a very good life in your old age.' sweet."-james *opens another one.* "'you will have a very good life in your old age.' what the hell? didn't i just get that one... ok. so it means that i either will have a VERY very good life in my old age, or they cancel out eachother. frik."-james  ack. i would have more quotes, but i'm on my computer upstairs (i was using the one downstairs today, and ALL of the good quotes are on it). so we'll save those for another day.  ok so. worst blog ever.  eeeeek. movies tomorrow. apparently it's cheap night ($8), so it shall be fun.  well, i'm outtie now. paice. (i love how i ALWAYS say paice. cuz, you know, i'm gangsta.)  i will play until the sky is black.  kayte.

(this was when she was talking to her brother, branko, on the phone after shopping.)* "what did you buy?"-branko "pink converse!"-sofija "CONSTANT FAILURE."*hangs up.*-branko   in a hail of sparks, and a tangle of wires- everything went wrong. says:  are you reading my blog now? i love how my blogs always rock.  i seek to cure what's deep inside.frightened of this thing that i've become. says:  YES  i seek to cure what's deep inside.frightened of this thing that i've become. says:  are you done yet?!?!?!  i seek to cure what's deep inside.frightened of this thing that i've become. says:  *repeats 813247 times, just like when kids say "are we there yet"...*   so this is continuous happiness- you know, i always imagined it something more. says:  aww! you're so cute.  i seek to cure what's deep inside.frightened of this thing that i've become. says:  no..

      (k, before i say anything...  MYSTIC RIVER IS A GOOD MOVIE. WATCH IT NOW. )  hey thurr.  i went to nikole's house today... wow nicest house ever. EVER. seriously. wow.   so i had to take the bus to her house... and it's funny cuz i had no idea what to do. cuz i a)didn't know what bus to take, and b)didn't know what bus stop to get off at... and nikole said she'd be waiting when i got off the bus, buuuut she wasn't. eff.  so it 45 minutes to take the bus there. seriously, why do buses take so f-cking long? if my brother were to drive me, then it would have taken 15 minutes to get to nikole's house from my house... that's a half an hour difference, for those of you who are mathemetically challenged.  so anyways... me and nikole chilled at her crib for like half an hour, then we went to "big bear", which is a convenience store... and the guy behind the counter was smiling at us the whole time. i kindof felt uncomfortable.  then we walked back through the ghetto to nikole's house... and we played yahtzee. (i think that's how you spell it.) but i sucked at it cuz i've never played it before, so we watched billy madison. wow it's THE randomest movie ever! i love it though.  aaand then... we had soup. it was so cool... and then i went home. (p.s. nikole, you're not boring. you ROCK.)  i've decided that i'm way too bitter towards the world (due to my list of things i hate about people, and the thing about friends). i was sitting on the bus, and i thought to myself "hey kate, maybe you should write something nice about people for once." so i shall put that on my list of things to do before school starts again. (i think i'll write it soon, so stay tuned.)  aaah i'm pretty sure i've decided that sofija is my favourite person in the world.  k so my brother's having a party in the basement right now... it's kindof funny, because people just started arriving at like 10. i wonder how long they'll be here for...  aaah i'm so booked for this week i think... ok, so not really.   tomorrow - hanging out with jess... she just came back from her grade 8 trip to quebec. and apparently she has  a lot  to tell me. woot.  monday - nothing.  tuesday - movies avec lana and co.  wednesday - going to the taylor evans talent show avec sofija. but it's in the morning, so i have to be dropped off at her house at frikin 8. eff.  and that's it.   in a hail of sparks, and a tangle of wires- everything went wrong. says:  i [heart] you.  [there are just some things that time cannot erase] says:  i [fart] on you.  *phone rings* "hello?"-me "hey, what's up?"-james (brother) "uhh nothing..."-me, not knowing why my brother is calling me/being nice to me. "cool. me and mum are going out for a while. are you coming home in the next half hour?"-james "no, i'll be home at like 6."-me "oh ok. sweet. ttyl."-james "...aha. paice."-me  "hey james, would you hate me if i got my eyebrow pierced?"-me "no more than usual."-james  "ugh i hate this music... why do you like it?"-me "because. it's better than alexisonfire."-james "uhh... no."-me "is this not  screamo  enough for you?"-james  *this is from a long time ago... like monday.* "mariam, please put that piece of paper away. it's not the time for oragami."-mr veats "oh, but it's  always  time for oragami."-liz   .Lana. says:  Kate Is The Hotness, Kate Is The Bestest I love Kate with my heart and soul and evertime i see her face i want a soup of bowl!!!!   i seek to cure what's deep inside.frightened of this thing that i've become.         ME AND ALEKS LOVE FRANK SINATRA!!! says:  i would love you  i seek to cure what's deep inside.frightened of this thing that i've become.

      hello.  kindof a boring day yesterday...  got woken up by the f-cking garbage truck at 8:00 yesterday. i'm going to kill the garbage man...  so i studied kindof yesterday morning, and had lunch, then took the bus to my math exam. it was cool...only not. then i cleaned out my locker, and my mum picked me up, and then she had to do some grocery shopping. while she was in zehr's, i sneakily put my alexisonfire cd on. and made her listen to it on the way home...she didn't say anything about it. so i think she hates it.  my dad's in australia right now...he's gonna be away for father's day.*tear*.  aaah i kindof had have plans last night... only kindof. cuz erin asked me to go over to her house and keep her company cuz she's babysitting her sister... but i said i couldn't cuz my mum wanted to watch a movie with me... and then my mum asked if i had plans and i said erin asked me to do something but i said no, and then she said it was fine if i wanted to. sooo then i called erin... but she was at simon's? what the hell.  so then i ended up going to her house... and we took her sister to the park, and played grounder. and hopscotch. and then we climbed ontop of this big cement building thing and pretended to be manikins. and then we went back to her house, her sister went to bed, and we watched a monty python marathon... it was SO funny. my ears hurt from erin laughing so much.  "now, michaelangelo, about this "last supper" painting..."-priest "what's wrong with it? don't you like the kangaroo?"-michaelangelo "kangaroo?! there was no kangaroo at the last supper!"-priest "oh, no problem. i'll just make him into a deciple."-michaelangelo "ah. now that's the problem..."-priest "what's the matter with the deciples?"-michaelangelo "...there's 28 of them."-priest "...too many?"-michaelangelo "of course it's too many! there were 12 deciples at the last supper, no kangaroos and  one  christ!"-priest " one ?!"-michaelangelo "yes! one! not three!"-priest "what? but i like it the way it is... the fat one kindof evens out the two skinny ones."-michaelangelo  ahahahaha. wow that's funny.  "hi, i'd like to have an argument, please."-man "ok, please go to room 12."-woman at desk "ok, thank you."-man *opens wrong door.*"hello."-man "what the hell do you want, you bastard?! get out of my face you tight git."-man at desk "...uh... is this where i have the argument?"-man "oh, sorry. this is abuse! you want room 12A, next door."-man at desk  ahahaha. woot. there are so many other quotes... but i can't remember them.  well, i'm outtie now. paice.  your dead fad is a disaster- your fashion is my fucking cancer.  kayte.

      k so i'm back... but only to ramble on about how much i hate people. here's a list of all the things i hate about what people do...   i hate how people...    1.  say "lolz".  2.  add random "z"'s on the end of words. (please see above.)  3.  say "yep", "yup", "yepper", or anything else that sounds overly perky.  4.  judge people they don't even know.  5.  move on from friend to friend so quickly.  6.  think they know what's best for you.  7.  think they know everything about your life.  8.  try to be something they're quite obviously  not .  9.  talk about themselves all the time, and when they do ask about you, the conversation is quickly overted back to them.  10.  say "you seemed like you were in a bad mood today."   11.  think their music is superior to others.  12.  don't bother to involve you in things.  13.  think they're "all that and a bag of potato chips".  14.  say "no, it's a waste of film" when you ask to have your picture taken.  15.  say they're joking, when obviously they're not.  16.  look at the food you're eating in digust and say "ewww what the hell is that?". god, grow up.  17.  strongly object to something you're excited about. (i.e. getting your eyebrow pierced.)  18.  talk loudly on the bus about something no one cares about, but they think they do.  19.  talk/hang out/ flirt  with the guy(s) you like, when they know you like them.  20.  and finally... i hate how people look at you like you shouldn't be somewhere.    well, there you have it. quite a long list, i must say. that's all i have to say about that... someday, i'll make a list of things i like about people. someday.  i'd scream this song right in your face- if you were here.  kayte.

      good evenin'.  had an awesome day on tuesday... really. took my digital camera to school, and got a shitload of pics of everyone...if you want to see some, ask me on msn or leave a comment! they are pretty awesome, so you don't want to miss out. woop woop.  ok so here was my day (wednesday).   math - did review...as in the teacher was teaching us review, and i was writing notes to erin.  art - wrote a f-cking essay in an hour. my hand hurt  so  much once i was done... man oh man.  lunch - took a bunch of pictures of people... saw tara again. she brought teo with her, and i got a pic of them. they're both so effing pretty... damn you all. i made a video with my camera... it starred ray, mike g, travis, and mark, it was narrated by erin, and vanessa made a guest-appearance. it was sweet/funny as hell.  gym - did a health culminating thingy. kindof sucked.  geography - went to lana's dram presentation! wow it rocked my pants off... everyone's thing was so effing funny... wow. how? keep reading to find out.  "we used to do everything together... we used to spend our saturdays together, and wash our hair together..."-lora, trying to be serious in her drama presentation. it was funny cuz of the randomness.. me and erin laughed for 27348563 minutes.  "hhhhhiiiii."- danny, but you had to be there to hear the voice.  there was other funny stuff too, but i forget.  wednesday was alright... it was the last day of school  forever ...well, until september at least.  k so today:   math - did review... f-cking sucked, considering it was the last day and we didn't have a party. effing mr. veats.  art - got to eat timbits! (mr. olsen rocks.) and we had to fill out an evaluation thing of the teacher and the class... it was cool. plus the fact that it wasn't, but you know.  lunch - hung out with the usual crowd... went to richardson's twice. and stalked  r  to the  o  to the  b  with chloe... that part rocked.  geography - did another review test... i didn't talk to anyone/no one talked to me the whole period... cuz erin wasn't thurr. eff you all.  gym - did another part of our culminating assignment thing... then we did a warm-up, and played games and stuff...t'was cool.  ok so quote time.  *as i was quizzing ray for geography.* "ok soo... next question. what is a push factor? give examples."-me "easy...factors that make you want to leave your country such as high taxes, weather....and...uncool people..."-ray  "hey kate, is that your backpack? or anson's?"-mr olsen, pointing to my pink backpack. "it's anson's."-me "oh yes... i love the pink."-anson "that's sexy."-leif, anson's brother. "dude, that's your brother you're talking about..."-me "i know. but hey, i'm in love with myself, and anson looks like me, so basically... i'm in love with him too."-leif  "my daughter used to like raisins... but then she went to her friend's house who had a rabbit... she thought its crap was raisins, and she ate them."-mr. olsen  and last but not least, today:  1. exam this morning . (geography. so easy! frik i was done by like 10 (started at 9), and i had to sit there doing nothing for a half hour until we were let out. but yeah, i think i aced it... aha yeah right.) 2. took bus downtown with erin.  3.  went to wimpy's for lunch with erin . (actually, it was more like a brunch thing...had pancakes and some sausages. woot woot.) 4.  went to dino's . (for like 5 minutes.) 5.  took the bus to the mall . 6.  bought the new alexisonfire cd . (most amazing cd i've heard in my  life . wow definetely go buy it... even erin liked some songs.) 7.  went to the photo booth . (twice. t'was awesome, but the pictures sucked.) 8.  took the bus downtown . 9.  went to gateway . (the grade 8's weren't there, so frik.) 10.  took the bus downtown AGAIN . (erin didn't come, and went home.) 11.  took the bus home . (i swear i was falling asleep on it... it was kindof funny.) 12.  got home . (i realized i didn't have my key and no one was home, so i had to sit on my front porch for half an hour until my mum and brother came home. all i wanted to do was sleep...) 13.  slept . 14.  and here i am .  woot. so that was my day! it was awesome, but  really  tiring...  i have barely any quotes, cuz i suck and i'm tired. but here's what i can remember.  "kate! stop   farting !"- erin. on the bus. infront of everyone.. even though i really wasn't.  aaah ok i'm leaving now.  paice.  in a hail of sparks, and a tangle of wires-  everything went wrong.  kayte.

      hello my loverlies...  how is everyone? sorry about the semi-mean blog before... i'm kindof over all that now.  so today was cool! saw erin (she went to montreal... *tear*). we hung out most of the lunch period, which is unusual for us, cuz you know... she usually goes home with cody... so it was awesome. (p.s. erin, i wasn't trying to be bitter by saying that.) ok so my day:   math - did a diagnostic test... gay.  art - worked on my final assignment (an essay about a freaky-ass painting) and mr olsen tried to help me with it... except now i have to change everything i already had, cuz all his ideas were different to mine... and obviously, he's right.  lunch - hung out with erin... we caught up. saw tara! she=SO effing pretty. god. bought pizza (even though i had a lunch). t'was alright.  gym - played handball - kindof a long game. and we got time to work on our notes for our in-class culminating thinger...but did i? psht. no.  geography - wow. best class of my LIFE. only cuz erin's in it...and she makes me laugh. but we had an exam review test thing, so that part kindof sucked... and i think i'm ready for my exam. yeah, that's right. ready.  "oh so we do have a test today? aaah i told you, mike! aha stick that in your pipe and  smoke it !"-ray. ahaha it's funny cuz that saying is the older than old cheese. (woot.)  "hello lula!"-me and erin about 37972 times today... in a chinese accent. guess you had to be there.  "hey do you want to be in the 'i heart erin t' club?!"-erin, as she writes 'i heart erin t. heart, heart.' on my hand...wow so random.  "aaah should i go to summer school? i don't know if i should... should i? maybe i will. what do you think, kate? do you think i should? i don't know... will you come with me to hand in my summer school form to the guidance office? but i don't know if i should go..."-sylvia. continues like this for 5 minutes.  "wow. doesn't he look special."-vanessa, after seeing you-know-who (guy on my bus who makes me have seizures when i see him). she probably meant retarded.  "sarcasm is like my life..."-me "ahaha that was sarcasm!"-vanessa "...uh no it wasn't...?"-me "yes it was!"-vanessa "no, i was exaggerating. not being sarcastic."-me "same fucking thing."-vanessa --yeah that really  was  funny...another one of those things that you had to be there for.--  k that's all for now, folks.  these eyes they're strongly covered in disguise- they're waiting on the real time again.  kayte.

      ok so me=kindof pissed off... (this blog is about no one in particular, so maybe all of you reading this should take something from it.)  what is a friend? really. someone who makes an effort to do something with you when they're free, who calls you every now and then to see how you are, and takes an interest in your life, someone who doesn't talk about themselves all of the time and asks you questions about you... am i getting warmer? why is it so hard for people to do those things? and for the record, i'm not saying i'm a perfect friend. that's not it at all... i'm just saying some of the things i've noticed recently. could someone PLEASE tell me why, as soon as a "new love-interest" person/thing enters your life, you completely discard your friends? just think about it... and when you get the answer to it, please get back to me. this is a question that keeps me up at night, and knowing why would answer some other questions i have...  well, now that i've probably pissed off some/most of my friends off, i bid you farewell. (for now.)  for all of this, i'm better off without you.  kayte.

      hello.  wow me=tired cuz it's not even 9:30 and i just woke up. yeah i'm pro.  so last night was fun... i went to vanessa's (again) and nikole was there, and we met evan, ray, and mike c at taylor evans, and then we walked to tim horton's (cuz i said i'd buy them donuts...), and i did. so after they complained about only getting 2 donuts each, we all walked back to vanessa's house, where we played karaoke. t'was fun.  evan, mike, and ray were all up at the karaoke machine, trying to read the words and follow along with the song...they failed miserably. (but good try guys... it was amusing.)  aha then the highlight of the night came... evan picked up a framed picture of vanessa's sister from the mantlepiece, and then he was putting it back, but it slipped from his hands and fell  face first  onto the floor... and the glass kindof broke. so he tried to get a vacuum to clean it up, but i wouldn't let him back in the room unless he told vanessa's dad... but he didn't, and just beat me down to get into the room.  so then we went upstairs cuz the guys wanted to see vanessa's pimp phone that has buttons the size of her hands, and her dad was upstairs... so we were like yelling at evan to tell her dad what he did.  "evan! go tell vanessa's dad what you  broke !"-nikole "no...why are you doing this?"-evan "just go tell her dad what you broke, evan in the  orange shirt ."-nikole "...mike, wanna switch shirts?"-evan  ahahaha wow. this went on for like 10 minutes... then eventually evan turned it on me? and was doing the same thing nikole was doing, but to me... yeah i dunno why. and then he kept saying he was never gonna hang out with us/me ever again...thanks...minus the fact that i didn't say anything.  aaand enough of that story.  ok so remember in my last blog, when i said my mum kindof said maybe to me getting my eyebrow pierced? look at this:  "i told your dad about the eyebrow piercing thing"-mum "oh really? what did he say?"-me "he was shocked..."-mum "oh... so does that mean i can't have it done?"-me "no, i don't think he minds."-mum "really?! so i can?!"-me "...well, it would hurt..."-mum "i know..."-me "well, i don't see why not."-mum "oh my god, are you serious?! i love you! you're so awesome!"-mum "well, you only live once. and you might as well just get it done when you're at this age."-mum  wow. i love my parents SOOOOO much...but i kindof might think about it for longer...cuz i dunno if i want to have it done...cuz of the pain. but hey, i will be hot times 2... haha yeah no, i'm kidding about the hot-ness.  "so ray, my mum said i can get my eyebrow pierced!"-me "oh my god. don't!"-evan "...uh... why not?"-me "because...just... no. don't."evan "what the hell? why not?"-me "cuz... i dunno. it's not right for girls to get facial piercings... i'd say this to any girl."-evan "yeah, it's true."-mike "uh mike, you said you think an eyebrow ring would suit me... and you're getting your lip pierced, so what the hell?"-me (kindof getting mad at this point... cuz they were being serious.) "no, i said an eyebrow ring would suit you more than a lip ring."-mike "ugh! guys... stop...you suck."-me  ugh they were kindof being a-holes last night...and if you guys are taking the time to read this (which i kindof doubt you are), then apologize. NOW.  so yeah...other quotes:  *singing/rapping to superman by eminem on the karaoke machine* "yeah, you want me to tell you something?"-evan (not knowing what's going on) *moans* "yeah"-girl in karaoke machine. "what the f-ck?!"-evan  *later on in the song* "girl, you make me earl. what the f-ck? 'you make me earl?' ahahahahaha!"-evan, and then he laughed for like 5 minutes.  "wow guys. this area is so ghetto."-evan, every 5 minutes.  frik, all these quotes are things that evan said...  anyway. aaah i forgot to say the biggest thing that happened on friday night in my previous blog!   MY BROTHER WENT TO FORMAL/PROM!   aaah exciting stuff! wow. his date looked SO pretty! and he bought her a rose! aaah. he rocks.  k so that's that.  and i'm done for now... i have to f-cking study for exams today.  i stay wrecked and jealous for this,  for this simple reason.  kayte.

      good afternoon.  wow i  haven't blogged since...wednesday. wow... i'm getting bad at this.  ok so thursday... nothing happened of significance... so fuck thursday.  friday... ah yes. friday. well nothing happened during the day, minus the fact that ray and mike c (who sit behind me in geography) were throwing pieces of eraser at the back of my head. mature, eh? yes. and apparently a piece of one was in my hair for the whole period, and then it was in my hair when i was on the bus, and it fell out while i was getting ready to go to vanessa's house at like... 6:45. thanks guys. love you too.  aah my mum drove me to vanessa's, and on the way there, we were talking about piercings.  "hey mum, i kindof want to get either my lip or my eyebrow pierced."-me "...NO.-mum "urgh."-me *20 seconds and a long silence later.* "...i think i'd rather you got your eyebrow pierced."-mum "omg really?! yeah i was semi-kidding about the lip thing."-me "yeah, i thought so. but kate, i don't think you could stand the pain. it would hurt  a lot ."-mum "yeah, but it would be so cool!"-me "yeah, it would."-mum --ok so for you people who don't understand why this has any significance... that's a maybe for getting my eyebrow pierced! aaah.--  so that was the awesome part of my evening... aha minus the part when i got to vanessa's house. we (actually, she) was singing along to  her karoaoke machine for like an hour.. while i straightened my hair with em's straightener. woot woot.  so we were at her house till like 9, and then we went to st. francis, and no one was there, so we sat and talked and slid down the banisters. t'was fun.  ok so tonight=semi-plans.  maybe  hanging out with vanessa, mike c, and ray and maybe other people... but since both of the guys said "sure maybe" when i asked them, i dunno yet.  k so i have several new loves... they= from first to last, keepsake, and the early november.   i never like the way you danced  by keepsake:    you told me not to put you up on a pedestal, fine then. i'll just sit here and die. it's all right. i'll drink another to you, i'll get in a fight or two, it doesn't matter with who. it's all right. a twenty one year old dream, now you'll corrupt the whole scene. i think it's gone far enough, it's all right. i think you know what i mean, i think you know what to do, i think i'm coming with you. looking back i never was so right. a night of fun would do us good night. so here's to losing you- a toast, my love, from me to you. drink up now, don't be a fool while you're still on my pedestal. so we should go out and dance, we'll have a night on the town, turn up the radio loud, it's all right. you'll drink another to me, you'll get in a fight or three, it doesn't matter to me. it's alright. a seventeen year old dream, now we've corrupted the whole scene, i think we've gone far enough, it's all right i think you know what i mean, i think you know what to do, i think i'm coming with you.    aaah no effing quotes... i suck at blogging now. i have no time/patience/life.  paice.  note to self: i miss you terribly.  kayte.

      frik i feel so shitty.  k so today and yesterday=hot as f-cking hell... and that's pretty hot! yeah.  aaah i haven't blogged for a while! so here it is.  aaah monday=best night of my life! i went to the gaelic gig thing, and delenda (mark, mike, ray, evan, anson) played, and so did my brother's band! wow they sure rocked my socks right off! except everyone in delenda didn't think they were good... but they were.  trust me.  yeah, i took jessica (keating) with me, and she kind of didn't like it haha. but me and sofija had a grand ol' time! my brother's band played  summer holiday  by cliff richards, and we clapped and sang along... no one else knew the words... suckas. yeah my brother rocked... i'm so proud! *tear.*  aaah tuesday was kind of sad... in the morning, went to a memorial service for my mum's friend who died of breast cancer. i cried kind of cried... but we didn't stay for the whole thing. good things that came out of it (we were told to think of the good things at the service) were the cucumber sandwiches (they were awesome... and i ate like 47384923), i got a new dress and got to get dressed up for it, which i don't usually do by the way, and i got the morning off. but when i got to school, i had to do gym, and it was  really  hot. and i had to do the beep test... and vanessa almost died. no joke. it was kind of scary. and then in geography i had to listen to boring presentations for the whole period. (no offence guys... i loved it, really. i just wasn't feeling great/was tired/kind of...upset.) yeah that was tuesday...  then today was boring/hot too! frik i need to sleep more at night... yeah nothing really happened today, except i had 2 freezies. yeah, that's how boring it was.  aaah best song ever= demolitian lovers  by my chemical romance. here are the lyrics... because i love them.    Hand in mine, into your icy blues  And then I'd say to you we could take to the highway  With this trunk of ammunition too  I'd end my days with you in a hail of bullets   I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know just how much you mean to me  And after all the the things we put each other through and   I would drive on to the end with you  A liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full  And I feel like there's nothing left to do  But prove myself to you and we'll keep it running   But this time, I mean it  I'll let you know just how much you mean to me  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of everything  I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow  And we go cold   Until the end, until this blood  Until this, I mean this, I mean this  Until the end of...   I'm trying, I'm trying  To let you know how much you mean  As days fade, and nights grow  And we go cold   But this time, we'll show them  We'll show them all how much we mean  As snow falls on desert sky  Until the end of every...   All we are, all we are  Is bullets I mean this   As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms  Forever, forever  Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning  Forever, and ever  Know how much I want to show you you're the only one  Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun   And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood  And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down  And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down  I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood  I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever    well i have to go now... cuz my brother needs the computer. paice.  kayte.

      good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen...sup.  aaah haven't blogged for a while... that's cuz i've been busy. yeah, that's right. kate mckenna, the loser-est of all losers, has been busy! woor.  k so yesterday afternoon at like 2, went to sylvia's house (commonly known as slovukachuk), and then we went to vanessa's house, and then to zehr's to get sylvia's pictures from the photo place thurr. after she'd got her pics, and vanessa her burger buns, we went to the cafe/sitting area...thing and sylvia bought us milkshakes! woot. (sylvia=awesome.)  aaah after the milkshakes, came the BEST part of my life! (apart from my run-in with scott fischer.) we caught tadpoles! yes. actually, vanessa caught them and me and sylvia watched...we named the smaller one ethuce and the bigger one brucel. (ethel and bruce combined...cuz those names rock times 2.) it was kind of fun.  so we walked back from zehr's, and went to sylvia's house where we ate chips/read magazines/went on her roof/went on msn/straightened our hair/went on her webcam with ray and evan a... ahaha they think i'm ugly.. it was pretty awesome... and then we went to vanessa's house (we left the tadpoles there, in case you were wondering what happened to them), and then sylvia went to the mall with steph. she left us... and we cried.   but then we met up with em at st. francis, talked for a bit there, then walked through the woods behind taylor evans (got bitten to f-cking death by mosquitos, and saw a dead squirrel), and we ran into mark, mike g, nick anapolsky, ben matsimoto and some other guys i don't know, and we chilled at the park and at st. francis and stuff... and then emily left us. *tear*.  when we were at the park, the guys started to get bored, so they said they were going to get pizza... and they walked a couple metres away, and stopped and just started talking and stuff. and me and vanessa were kind of confused as to what they were doing... but yeah, then we decided to leave too. and then mike came running after us and walked with us. then we got to st. francis and we started sliding down the banisters at the front of the school, and kind of had races on them. it was fun... and apparently i don't know how to do it? eff you mike. i  so  do.  yeah after that, ben came to the school... and we star-gazed. and tried to figure out which one was the big dipper, and which one was the little dipper.  "which one's the big dipper?"-me "...the big one...?-vanessa  *after seeing mike lying on his back with his hands crossed on his chest.* "you look like you're in a sarcophagus."-me "hey, isn't that the thing in your throat?"-vanessa  "i think ben likes kate!"-nick "no! she's ugly."-ben (thanks buddy.)  *as mark was talking with a lisp.* "you're not gonna be able to stop talking like that."-me "yeth i will! oh frik."-mark  *after sylvia answered the door.* "hi!"-sylvia "hi"-me "...awww you're so cute!!!"-sylvia  aha ok those are all the quotes that i can remember/that are funny.  aaand i'm spent. aaah i've done NO homework today. wow. and i'm not going to do any, either! muahahahaha...ha...  you've got the map- come get to me.  these knuckles break, before they bleed.  kayte.

      aaah tonight=best night of my life. why? scott fischer effing hit on me. wow. me=SO happy. i mean wow.  so i went to vanessa's house tonight... with erblina and jenelle, and we watched eurotrip. it was a gooooood movie. times 2! wow kind of kinky though... yeah after the movie, we went walking around. we almost called on ray, but it looked like no one was home, and then we called on mike c but he wasn't home. we talked to his mom again... she's a cool mom.  "hi, is mike home?"-jenelle "no, sorry he went to gavin's house. a whole bunch of them went and took their guitars."-mike's mom. "oh ok. thank you."-everyone at the same time. "can i tell him who was calling?"-mike's mom. "uh...kate."-jenelle "haha sure, you girls always pick on kate."-mike's mom.  she's awesome. yeah.  so after we went to mike's, we walked to gavin's house... and on the way, we stopped at jenelle's cuz i had to pee. and then she stayed at home, and we continued our journey to gavin's house. t'was fun. and then when we got to gavin's house, we couldn't work up the courage to go to his door. haha cuz you know... he's so intimidating. haha not. and yeah, we were standing outside his house for like 10 minutes, and then we didn't go to his door aha. "woor".  so after deciding not to call on gavin after all of that, we started walking back to vanessa's house. and we were walking along her street, and these 2 cars pulled up. (a van and a sedan.) and this guy in the van was like "hey ladies... what's up?" (hitting on us. yeah, fun.) and the guy in the sedan was like "oh hey ladies..." and then they drove away. but i looked at the guy in the sedan, and who was it?!  scott effing fischer.  i was like crying cuz i was so  happy. i mean wow... so hot. (scott fischer=grade 12 guy. my dream.)  so after crying tears of joy, we finally got to vanessa's house. then erblina went home, and then i went home shortly after. t'was some good times right thurr.   in the depths of shadows, lingers my love for you.  says: what do guys talk about? aha tell me truthfully.  in the depths of shadows, lingers my love for you.  says: it's a secret no girls know.  Ray  says: actually we didn't talk about anything we made fun of geoff played some ping pong ate hot dogs and petted his dogs fro  *ray=coolest guy ever...not to mention the  funniest. *  "scotty doesn't know!"-erblina. 173974 times tonight.  "hey, this isn't where i parked my car..."-guy in eurotrip, everytime someone was gonna beat him up.  frik... i really suck at remembering quotes...  wellll i'm outtie now... me=tired to the max. paice.   don't treat me like i never accused you. kayte.

      good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.  sup.  today was ok. and when i say ok, i mean mediocre... apart from lunch. me+sofija=hung out. we chilled. she read a poem i wrote... and she actually  liked  it! aaaah. amazing.  amazing.  yeah, it semi-rocks.  k so danielle=crazy. why? because she doesn't think you-know-who (guy on bus) is hot! at all! god.  wow today i was apparently really funny. (according to sofija.) cuz she kept laughing like every 5 seconds, even when i didn't say anything funny... ahaha she makes me feel so awesome aha. i love sofija... so part of my blog will be dedicated to her, and only her. (the other part, sadly, won't.)  10 things i love about sofija vrbaski.  10. she is amazingly pretty. times 2. 9. she makes me laugh. 8. she laughs about just about everything. 7. she is one of the nicest people i know. 6. everyone loves her. (and everyone who doesn't must  die .) 5. she has a nice laugh. 4. she makes amazing nicknames for people. 3. she has an amazing personality. 2. she doesn't put people down. 1. she invented "woor." enough said.  k so that was my list... p.s. i didn't spell her last name wrong. woor. (ahahahahaha.)  "now i'm gonna call you every second, every day."-nikole. "uhh... please don't..."-me. "oh i will."-nikole. "haha. yay. (note the sarcasm.)-me "haha you're funny. (note the  not !"-nikole.  ahaha i laughed.  ok so no quotes from today... minus the ones that happened avec sofija. but there are just  way  too many. so you don't get to see them. nananabooboo. k i'm done now.  normally, i would write my poem thing that i wrote in here... but since i'm too lazy/it's upstairs, i'm not going to. that shall be for another time, kids.  so my plans for this weekend=going to vanessa's house tomorrow night to watch europtrip, prolly with lana and erblina, if everything goes as planned. and theeeeen on saturday i want to go shopping (still waiting for someone to come with me... any takers?), and then i'll prolly go to vanessa's house  yet again  on saturday. me+vanessa=lovers... times 2.  k well i'm outtie now.  paice.  kayte.

       hey there.   whaddup.   haven't blogged since...wednesday. so i suck. but whatever.   so yeah i got my retainer...it's so sweet. but it feels wierd, and i have a lisp (or a lithp, whichever you prefer). anyhow.   so my day yesterday. my dad dropped me off downtown, and when the buses came sofija wasn't there. so i cried...aha not really, but yes. then i waited for an hour, and she didn't come, so i took the bus home. when i got home, my mum's friends (who are staying at our house) told me that sofija called like 4 times...so i called her back, and it turns out she missed the bus. so then i went downtown again, and this time she came! aha. then we walked to the library, where she returned her book, and then we walked back to the fountain downtown, and sat there until the buses came.   then we took the bus, and got off near pergola. then we got a milkshake from there, and walked back to my house. that is when sofija bought some kool-aid from a little kid on my street...and it took her like 283254829 hours to drink it. (and the kid spilled it everywhere when he was pouring it...poor guy.) then we went to my house, and i showed her around. it took so long, cuz she had to absorb everything in each room before she could move on...aha it was funny. then i made spaghetti...just for the fun of it.&nbsp;aha.&nbsp;then we hung out in my crib yo, and i showed her pictures of me when i was little (and fat). then, for the first time in my life, we went on my roof. (cuz no one was home...i'm not allowed to go on my roof, but whateva.) then we went back inside, cuz it was hot/sofija thought my dad was going to come home and hate her for being on the roof.   anywho. then we went on the ledge above the hall (which is hard to get on/high/scary, for those of you who haven't seen it) and just sat there and talked...then my brother came home, and told us to get down. so then we just hung out in my room and stuff...then we sat on the stairs for like an hour, talking and stuff. then my dad came home, and my mum's friends made pizzas...so we ate them, obviously. then my mum came home from work at like 8, and drove sofija home.   then i went on msn for like half an hour, played the sims, and talked with my parents and their friends and stuff...then i went to bed at like 10...cuz i was tired.   so yes. it was a sweet day.   *awkward silence between my brother, sofija and i.*  "...so...whaddup."-me  "ahaha you're so mean."-sofija  "..."-me  "oh you said whaddup. i thought you said shut up."-sofija   *after my necklace fell off...*  "ahahahahahahahaha!"-sofija. laughs for like 10 minutes.  "..."-me  "ahahaha oh man. that was the best part of my life."-sofija   "i'm going to go get some spaghetti. and put it all over your ledge, and call it art."-sofija    &nbsp;  "will your dad hate me if i go on the roof?"-sofija   *ten minutes later.*   "will your dad hate me if i go on the ledge?"-sofija   *continues like this for like the whole time she's at my house.    &nbsp;  "hey kate. how you smellin'? i am oficially [scratches out oficially, writes cool] the awesomest person ever parceque i'm the first person to write here. THAT'S RIGHT! [heart] sofija."-something sofija wrote on my wall...it's so cool.    &nbsp;  anywho. that's all, folks.    &nbsp;  2 days! aaah i can't believe i leave on monday...wow. this weekend=packing for kate.&nbsp; i'll miss blogging...and of course, my friends. and my dad and brother. but anywho.    &nbsp;  here&nbsp;i am watching clouds from your bedroom window,   as we’re laying here.    &nbsp;  kayte.

       hello.    &nbsp;  last night was sweet...went to vanessa's house, for her birthday part-ay. it was sweet, as expected. i was the first person to get there (yay) and while we waited for everyone else to arrive, vanessa blew up balloons and put them on her tree and on a light. it was funny cuz everytime she blew one up and attached it to something, it would pop. and she was like crying...and eventually all the pink ones were gone. yes. fun stuff.    &nbsp;  then erblina arrived, and we went into the basement and chilled yo. then erin came, and we went on vanessa's webam, and then tim came. i haven't seen tim since exams...so i gave him like 2490578 hugs. he liked it.    &nbsp;  so after webcaming it, we went outside on vanessa's deck, and we listened to music and talked and stuff. then we had dinner (hamburgers and fries, in case you were wondering...which i know you were.), and then we semi-danced. and when i say semi, i mean me and erin did the tango. and everyone else watched...it was sweet. and whenever erin tried to dip me, i fell...it was sweet. i was laughing so hard. then vanessa brought out her video camera, and we made a video! it was basically just of us being...well, us. and we kept passing the camera around so everyone could use it.    &nbsp;  then eventually, we went inside, watched the video we made and some video from grade 8...and vanessa had glasses in it. it was wierd. (aha i'm kidding. it was wierd. it was cute.) then we went into the basement and watched pearl harbour. and since tim's a guy, he had to comment on the fact that it was a love story...and when i say comment, i don't mean in a good way.    &nbsp;  so since we didn't have enough time to watch the movie, i just told them the ending...and ruined it for them. then we went outside, erblina's dad picked her up, and me, tim, erin and vanessa just waited outside for the rest of the parents to come. ahaha then the best part of the evening came...k, it was like 10:45, and you know how you're not supposed to be loud after 11:00? yeah. well there was this woman on vanessa's street, like 2 houses down from her, and she came out at 10:45, and told us to be quiet or she'd call the police. when really, we weren't being that loud. (minus tim throwing rocks and this big metal thing on vanessa's lawn. and it made a loud noise...but whatever.) and if we were being loud, then vanessa's mom would have told us. so this woman needs to relax. but it was funny...then she went inside, and we made fun of her. (kindof mean, yes. but again...whatever.) then we talked and stuff, and then my brother came to pick me up. and drove me home, obviously.    &nbsp;  then i went to bed...cuz i had to wake up early today. because i have an orthodontist appointment at 9:50. and i have to take the bus...but i could have woken up later then 6:30, but i thought it was at 9 and my dad was driving me.&nbsp; but no. i have to take the bus...erin wants me to visit her at bunsmaster (where she works) after my appointment...i would...but i don't know where it is. fruk.    &nbsp;  "were janet and david home when you went out?"-me   "no. but we had dinner."-my brother...so random. and so pointless.    &nbsp;  "go to sleep."-woman telling us to be quiet...yes. i'm going to go to sleep at 11. or you know,&nbsp;not.    &nbsp;  "is that nice 'n' easy?"-vanessa's mom, talking about the dye erblina got vanessa.   "no. it's hard 'n' fast."-erin.    &nbsp;  frik. i suck.    &nbsp;  so i shall be leaving to catch the bus soon...it should be fun. (only not.)    &nbsp;  aaah so excited for tomorrow. cuz sofija's coming over! wow. i'm seriously so psyched...minus the fact that she wants me to meet her downtown at 8:15. then we're catching the bus back to my house, and probably going on adventures. so yes. should be so sweet.    &nbsp;  the brightness left your eyes,    as i held your face.    &nbsp;  kayte.

       ok so my previous blog had a little bit of&nbsp;a lie on it...although it made my day better, vanessa's humourous comment(s) were not the highlight of my life. (i still have love for you, nessa baby. always.) ok so i forgot to tell my  biggest  news of my life.    &nbsp;    I GOT MY BRACES OFF!      &nbsp;  don't adjust your monitors folks, because you did indeed read that correctly. i am now brace-free, and (minus the metal wires running along the back of my teeth) metal-free. wednesday=getting my kickass retainer. it's pink and yellow (plaid pattern thing). yes. sweetness.    &nbsp;  so nessa's birthday party on tuesday (tomorrow). it's going to be sa-weet.     &nbsp;  and i'm going now...    &nbsp;  i'll kiss your lips again.    &nbsp;  kayte.

[love.]    &nbsp;  well, i'm off now...to do nothing. word.    &nbsp;  lata skata.

       time for a bitching/complaining/pathetic blog...then again, when are my blogs  not  all of those things?  &nbsp;  so...i kindof hate my life right now, for those of you who care. well, i guess "hate" is a strong word to describe my  whole  life...but i'm pretty sure i hate the social aspect of it. why, you may ask? well...to put it in lamence terms:  i don't have a social life.  now, i guess it's not fair to blame it on all my friends, because i know what you guys are thinking: "well do you really make an effort to plan things with them?" no. i guess i don't, but does that mean they shouldn't include me in things? my summer has probably been the worst summer so far. however, on the nights when i have left my hole in the ground and ventured out into the world, i've had an awesome time...i guess i should blame it on the area that i live in, and i'm sure that's what all of you (who know where i live in regards to where my friends live) are expecting/wanting me to say. so there. i said it. it's my fault, or more specifically, it's the area in which i live. it wasn't my choice to live out here, even though i loved the idea of it before i moved. but that was before i knew/thought that my friends would completely lose touch with me. whatever. i'm sick of this whole thing...fuck it all.  &nbsp;   she's finally seen she's a beautiful girl with a smile so grand she could stop the world.

      whaddup. (wow, i'm really running out of ideas for greetings.)  today was sweet...got up at 9:30 (not so sweet), went on msn, had a shower, packed my bag, and took the bus to emily's house! then we walked to erin's house, vanessa came over, and then we all went svimming in erin's awesome pool.  then we all dried off, i took some pictures with my camera, and then we did hair/make-up. then vanessa went home, and me, erin and em walked to the school, em went to track, and me and erin picked up her little sister from camp. then we went back to her house, and my dad picked me up.  *as emily was doing my make-up* "you look like your brother."-emily. "...thanks."-me  "i'm drowning!"-vanessa "then stand up!"-me  "i was sitting in the hospital, and all the nurses were talking. and i was listening, and they said 'havent u seen those? they're huge! they're like long and big, and black, and 1 inch in diameter'...and i waslike thinking to myself 'hmm...lemme guess..a penis?'...and the other nurse said "oh yeah, ive seen those slugs!"...haha, perverted nurses."-vanessa   Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:  apparently your supposed to put toothpaste on misquitoe bites.  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   my gramma told me. because ihave 36 of them   Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   fuck, my legs look so yukki  a bitter ending to a slow decay- so take your tears and go away, and i'll sit here with a smile and a match.[13 days. woor.] says:  eww 36?  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   yes  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   and the wierd thing is, i was wearing pants.  Vanessa  *birthday in 8days!* says:   FUCKING PERVERTED MISQUITOES WENT DOWN MY PANTS! god!  ...i can't remember anything else. fruk.  so no plans for this week...well, i have my mum's friends' visit to look forward to (not). it's not my mum's friend that's the problem...it's her son. he's my brother's age, and my brother's going to be away at summer school. so that means i might have to entertain the guy for the day...won't that be fun/awkward.  i got a major burn on my shoulders/back today. it was sweet...kindof. it hurts right now...and i don't know how i'll be able to sleep. woor.  13 days till england. 6 days till i get my braces off. so much to look forward to.  well, i'm out. paice. (running out of goodbye things as well.)  butterflies and zebras, and moonbeams and fairy tales- that's all she ever thinks about.  kayte.  p.s. jimi hendrix is sweet.

      "heyy". (props to vanessa.)  wow i've had a cool last couple of days...yes, i must admit, i haven't sat around at home! yes. i know. shocking.  so last night, me and erin went out for chinese! yes. it was sweet... her mom drove us there after i got dropped off at her house, and we ate...a lot. cuz it was the buffet. we had like 2 plates full, then desert...and erin had to take like every kind of desert there was. but it turned out that she didn't really like anything but the jello...aha yeah.  then after dinner, we walked back to her house. yes. walked. we walked all the way from china park, down willow, down paisley, down stephanie, then up rochelle, cuz i had this amazing idea to go call on ray...cuz he has no friends and would most likely be home.  so we went to ray's house, then we walked to st. francis...ray was being a bit quieter than he usually is cuz he was "tired"...psht. then we stayed at st. francis for like half an hour(?) and we asked ray loads of questions like what he looks for in a girl and stuff...and he was kindof uncomfortable with it...ahaha you should have seen his face. baha.  then after giving ray the spanish inquisition, we walked to beckers/mac's and me and erin bought drinks...and while we were standing in line, we all contemplated whether or not to believe the tabloids when they said that mary-kate is, in fact, on cocaine...and not anorexic. but whatever.  so after that, we walked back to st. francis...where i threw coins at ray. t'was fun. then we started walking towards the forest and stephanie park, and we saw these lights coming from the forest...and all of a sudden this jeep drove out...it was wierd/scary. then we walked through the forest in the dark, while i thought (out loud) about how the bushes were big enough to hide a grown man (preferably a rapist/murderer). it was pleasant. then we got to taylor evan's, and ray chased this little bunny around for like 5 minutes...it was so cute...and so scared. poor guy.  then we semi-walked ray home, and me and erin walked through the field at springdale park back to her house...then we sat in her kitchen for like 10 minutes until my mum picked me up. it was, overall, a sweet night.  so today...woke up at like 11:30, had a shower, got dressed, and watched tv with my dad...then erin called me and asked me to go to the mall, then we did...at like 3. so before i went, i played the sims for like 2 hours. (wow time flies  really  fast when you're playing that game...no joke.)  then i met erin at the mall, and we shopped...she bought sandals and serum (ahaha) and i bought 2 shirts and 2 necklaces...with money to spare. then we had fries...then my brother picked us up. then i had dinner, watched girl with the pearl earring...kindof a good movie...just kindof.  oh wow. ok so my dad's turning 50 this year (in september) so we're going to new orleans...yeah. for his birthday. sweet eh? i'm excited.  so. 15 days till england/wales. and 7 days till i get my braces off. wow, the time goes by really quickly.  so anyways. quotes.  "would you like a fork?"-chinese lady at china park. "yes please."-me, erin. *brings back a knife.*-chinese lady.  "haha i dare you to throw your jello at that woman."-me, talking about a lady who just walked into the restaurant. "haha i'd do it for money."-erin...aha it was funny cuz she kindof emphasized "it"...but yeah.  "you'd think they would have realized that there's no road by now."-ray, talking about the jeep coming out of the forest.  "it could've had a heart attack!"-me, talking about the bunny. "...oh well."-erin  anyways. i'm going to bed now...paice.  this is a love song... deal with it.  kayte.

      time for a serious blog.  well, i just read [anonymous]'s blog...and it got me thinking. maybe i should try working on some friendships...i know i should work on all of them, but there are some in particular. i really try to treat people the same way, and with respect...and i like to think of myself as a nice person. but after reading this person's blog, i realized that i'm not as nice as i thought i was. this person, who i have been friends with (well, sometimes enemies) since kindergarten, is an amazing person, and, despite her faults (which we all have), she's been there for me for as long as i can remember.  i remember, i think it was in grade 7 or 6, we got in a fight. and she, being the sweet person she is, got down on her knees and sang me a song to get me to be her friend again. i remember that so vividly, like it was yesterday...and i'll never forget it.  there are also other people's friendships i need to work on...my best friend, for example. i love you with all my heart, and i guess i'll have to accept the fact that you have a man in your life...and i know he must mean a lot to you. i'm sorry for getting angry when i felt that you were ditching me, and i'm sorry for getting upset sometimes when you're doing something with him, instead of me. i've been so selfish recently, and i regret the way i made you feel sometimes.  i know i've been spending quite a bit of time with i guess my new friends, but that's what high school does to you, right? i've been introduced to so many amazing new friends, and i think that's a good thing. some of them have changed me, for the better i think, and i have so much fun with them. don't get me wrong though, i still have so much fun with my old friends.  i guess what i'm trying to say is, i'm sorry to everyone i've hurt over the years, or months. everyday i try to be a better person, and i guess you could say that's my goal in life. i would never be where i am right now without you guys, and i couldn't ask for better friends. you all "rock my face off", in the words of staci, and i hope you will remember me when we're all old and frail.  ok. so it feels good to get all that out of me... and now, on to a comedic moment. brought to you by, sofija.   sofija                    HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNA AND KATRINA!!!!!!   says:  we are going on vacation on the same day.. that is a sign.. it means that in our future, a lot of angry monks await us in tibet.  if that didn't make you piss yourself, then you deserve to die. (actually, that's kindof harsh...so just laugh now to save yourself the trouble.)  and now, i shall copy erin and post some alexisonfire lyrics. however, they're not the "nicest" ones that i could find. they are, however, the best.   this is really only all we have:  day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. you had the coldest eyes and the softest touch: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. these typed letters, beneath me. fuck with these buttons and knobs long enough, and maybe things will turn out fine. hide behind your crystal screen and blow kisses at me. remember what we said wouldn’t happen? write your name on my chest in kerosene. spark a match and you will never be cold again. this is really only all we have: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. you had the coldest eyes and the softest touch: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. gag and destroy me, gag-me. i have a large collection of thunder, that i stole from your window sill.   kayte.

      aloha.  how are things? good? good.  today, like all my other days, was cool. woke up at 10:30... went on msn, watched tv, then got dressed at like 1:30. then i played the sims...wow erin, you inspired me yesterday and i can't stop playing it. eff you.  then i had dinner, and i went to home depot with my parents...yeah, that's how bored i was. (but hey, my mum promised me a treat.)  then we went home, and my mum took me out for an ice cream. then we sat in the parking lot for like half an hour just talking...it was really sweet.  then, on the way home, we drove past you-know-who (guy who takes my bus)...wow i like had a heart attack...but secretly, so my mum wouldn't know. then we got home, and now i'm on msn. exciting, eh? yes. very.  so tomorrow, my mum's taking me shopping for stuff for england...i.e. a raincoat, socks...yeah. should be sweet...?  "oh my god. avril lavigne is going out with the lead singer of sum 41."-me "...is that a bad thing?"-my mum "uh yes. he's too good for her."-me "are you saying that it would be better if  you  were going out with him?"-my mum "...uh yes. i mean...no..."-me  "let's just sit here and watch the world go by."-my mum  well, that's all folks.  i think that the truth is, i'm everything i hate.  kayte.  p.s. 18 days!

      bonjour, mes amis.  yeah, that's right. french.  so today was mediocre...woke up at 10:30, talked to lana on msn...had a shower, made plans with lana to go to the movies.  but tonight was so sweet. took the bus to sofija's house, then her dad drove me, lana, and sofija to galaxy.  after we bought our tickets, we went to A&W, cuz i was dying of hunger. (seriously.) then we went to see the notebook...we got in the theatre and there were like  no  seats left. so we had to sit right at the front...and it was really close. and we had to look up to see the movie...and my neck hurts. it was sweet though.  ok so the movie was one of the best movies i've ever seen...really. wow i cried at the end...actually, no. cried is an understatement. i  balled . yeah that's right...me, lana, and sofija cried SO hard... it was so cool. then after the movie, we went to tim horton's to get me a bottle of water (because now i was dying of a headache), then they left me and i took the bus home.  "lana, shut up."-me and sofija, every time lana talked during the movie. which was like...3742 times.  "why is it taking her so long?"-sofija. you really have to see the movie/had to be there.  "lana, stop eating her food! she's starving! lana, stop! i'm being serious...lana!"-sofija.  it's funny cuz i had to call my dad before i got on the bus that takes me downtown, then i had to call him when i got downtown, then i had to call him when i got off the bus and was walking to our house. only cuz it was like 10:30 at night...anywho.  and now here i am...tonight was sweet. but, i shall miss you lana, my love. i do hope you have a smashing time in yugoslavia...i'm sure you will.   don't try to be cute with me,  cuz i know you hate yourself.  kayte.

      welcome.  today/tonight was cool. did nothing all day, like i predicted...but then me and chelsea decided to plan a trip to the movies...so me, her, and chloe went together. and while my brother was driving me thurr, erin called me on ma cell, and asked me to pick her up. alas, i couldn't cuz we were running late and i had to meet chloe and chelsea at 7...i'm sorry erin. i wanted you there. i did.  then i got to galaxy, and met up with chloe and chelsea. we bought food, then went to watch spiderman 2. it kindof...well, sucked. it was confusing/corny/...just not very good. but whatever...don't let me put you off seeing it! and all through the movie chloe was making random/funny comments...and i tried not to laugh/disrupt the audience around us. i would put some quotes on hurr, but it would spoil the movie for you all (who haven't seen it, that is).  so after the movie, we abandoned chelsea (she was waiting for her mom to pick her up), and me and chloe walked to the bus stop. after realizing that we had to wait another half hour for the bus, we went to tim horton's. me, being the pig i am, bought 3 donuts. *grins* and chloe bought...a coffee. i felt fat. (thanks chloe. *tear*)  so then we went back to the bus stop, and waited for...5 minutes. then my dad called me, and said he would pick us up cuz it was kindof too late to catch the bus. so we walked back to galaxy and waited for him...then he drove chloe home, and we went home. it was a good night.  "i really suck at giving directions."-chloe, after trying to explain to my dad where she lives. "yes. you do."-my dad.  "would you shoot me if i started singing?"-me. "no...but i'd throw these nibs at you."-chloe.  "could i have some cotton candy?"-me "oh yeah sure! here, you can choose your own. if you don't like the ones close to you, then this thing spins...oh no. no it doesn't."-girl behind counter, trying to sping the...spinny thing...  "i think we should hitch a ride with  those  thugs."-chloe, everytime a car playing loud music drove by when we were at the bus stop.  "that would be in-tents."-vanessa.  so i think i'm going to the movies tomorrow night, too. cuz it's lana's semi-last day here before she goes to yugoslavia for like...a month. (thanks for leaving me, lana. frik...but have a good time! i love you.)  and that is all.  i want you to ruin me.  kayte.

      one of the many reasons i love sofija:   bleached and blinded by these nights.where im tossing and tortured till dawn.. says:  i could easily live without my pancreas.. what does it do?!  bleached and blinded by these nights.where im tossing and tortured till dawn.. says:  nothing... the liver is much more important.. you never hear anyone talking about the pancreas.  you know i am your worst nightmare- oh, how you love my bloody kiss.[20 days. woor.] says:  that's very true, young sofo. i think you may have had a scientific break through.  bleached and blinded by these nights.where im tossing and tortured till dawn.. says:  ahaha definately. i always have them.  bleached and blinded by these nights.where im tossing and tortured till dawn.. says:  like that time i discovered that celluloid was flammable.. from then on, no more dentures were made from celluloid, parceque smoking could ignite them!!! crazy, but i saved lives.. that was one of my earlier breakthroughs. 1650-ish.  ...enough said.  with the right drapes, the right paints, the right frames... this could really work.  kayte.

      good morning.  last night was kindof boring... i watched  shakespeare in love  with my parents, then i went on msn till like 1. it's funny cuz i'm kindof afraid of the dark and being alone in the dark, and i thought everyone else in my house was asleep so i was kindof scared...so i went into the kitchen to get a drink, and i heard voices coming from the basement, so i walked over to the basement door, and apparently my brother had friends over? so i was like laughing at myself...then i went back on msn, then i heard someone in the kitchen, so i went to see who it was, and it was austin (my brother's friend)...  "why are you still here?"-me. "...uh...cuz i live here...?"-austin, talking to me like i'm retarded.  oh i also watched some monty python with my dad yesterday...wow best joke/quote ever:  "american beer is like making love in a canoe."-man #1 "how?"-man #2 "they're both fucking close to water."-man #1  ahahaha. woooooot.  got woken up at 10:30 today... there are these guys with big trucks outside my house and they're making as much noise as possible. fucking losers/assholes.  not doing anything today...my brother's at summer school. sucka. i think i'll just stay on msn the whole day, minus bathroom/food breaks.  well i'm out.  you sing the words, but still don't know what they mean.  kayte.

      good evening.  how are we all? smashing, i presume...and that's enough of that.  so today, like all my other days so far this summer, was boring. wow, i really hate living out here (away from my friends)...it results in a boring summer. frik. i also hate how my brother has unlimited use of the car, but i have to take the bus almost everywhere. wow. does that sound unfair to you? it's so unfair, i sometimes cry.  anyway. did nothing today...had a bath...that was the highlight of my day.  whenever i think of how bored/lonely i am, i just think "hey, soon you'll be on your way to england." and that always gets a smile on my face... just 21 days. although, i have to put up with a 2 week visit from my mum's friend, her husband, and their son before i go. their son's kindof wierd...only eats hotdogs and baked beans. yeah. not kidding.  so. hey, if anyone ever wants to do something...don't hesitate to call/ask. really...i'm going to die.  so i'm going to go and do nothing now. bye.   and all i ever wanted, was someone to love me back to the bliss of ignorance- cause i feel like running head first into traffic.  kayte.

(i always do that nowadays), and i made a list of things to pack for england... i'm so gay. then i kindof hung out with my mum, went on msn again... omgsh i watched air bud spikes back.  worst movie ever.  there is not  one  decent actor in that movie. god.  anyway. after doing all that jazz, i had dinner, then i went to the movies with jess. we saw stepford wives... it's a sweet movie! it was kindof scary at times though. aha during the movie, i dropped my phone...and the battery fell out, and i couldn't find it. so i waited till the movie was done and some lights came on, and me and jess tried to look for it...but we couldn't find it. so we had to get one of the guys that works thurr to get a flashlight...but instead, he turned on all of the lights in the theatre...but we still couldn't find it. then he left again to get a flashlight this time, and we found it before he got back. ahahahah. t'was funny.  anyway. i FINALLY got those bracelets that some people like to call  sex bracelets  at the dollar store...but they only had black. assholes. so i bought 2 packets.*grins*  ack i saw morgan again yesterday... at the movies. it was sweet.  so after the movie, we walked around in the deserted mall and went outside and waited for jess's dad to pick us up. then i went home, and went on msn again. woor.  anyway. no plans for today.  sifting through weathered photo albums, looking for gloriously aged polaroids of places you have never been.  kayte.  p.s. 22 days. p.p.s. mike (chaulk), you suck more.

      whaddup playa-pimp.  last night was amazing...kindof. went to riverside. my evening/night was as follows:  my mum drove me to lana's house...but she wasn't thurr. so she took me to canadian tire, where i was supposed to meet everyone. but when i got there, there was no one waiting. so i waited in the car until people came...but only mike c, ray, evan, mark and this randy guy that i don't know came. so i decided to wait for more people with them... then, half an hour after everyone was supposed to meet, vanessa and erblina showed up. so then we waited for another like 5 minutes, then we walked to riverside.  aha it was funny cuz no one knew we had to pay...it was $2 a person, or $5 for a family. so all 8 of us got in as a family... it was so sweet.  "how much is it?"-guys "$2 a person, or $5 for a family."-man "oh frik."-everyone "i suggest you all get together right now and decide what your last name is gonna be."-man  ahaha it was so sweet. so mark paid...i think we're supposed to pay him back. (psht.)  then when we got to the carnival thingy, and sylvia and anna and her friend came. i got excited by the ferris wheel. it looked like so much fun. so i bought coupons...but no one else did. aha. then we walked all the way to the other side of the park, and went to the petting zoo. and saw llamas. everyone loved the llamas. then we walked to the lake/pong/thing and watched little kids playing in the dirty water...then ray threw a golf ball into this waterfall thing to watch it go down and into the lake/pond/thing. it was amusing.  then we started walking to get some food, but the guys got distracted by a tree, so they climbed it and us girls kindof watched. then we were gonna leave them, but they came down, and we again started walking to get some food. and then sofija and kate and brian and vanessa and robyn and i think that's it arrived. so the guys and them went to the petting zoo, and erblina, vanessa, sylvia, and i went to the hotdog stand.  while we were at the hotdog stand, we saw christian. so he talked to us, then he just left. without saying goodbye. thanks.  then after we ate, we walked again. then me and sylvia got in line for the ferris wheel, and vanessa and erblina walked around. me and sylvia were waiting in line for like...half an hour. it sucked. but then when we got on, i was like freaking out cuz i was so excited. (i hadn't been on one for like...ever.) it was so funny...cuz sylvia kept rocking the seat, and i thought i was gonna fall off. then we were looking for the guys (they were all wearing black t-shirts, so we thought it would be easy to find them), but when we got to the top there was like a sea of black-shirt-wearing people...so obviously we couldn't find them. then vanessa and erblina came and watched us on the ferris wheel, and they were like laughing at me. cuz i was laughing so hard...wow i'm such a loser.  so after the ferris wheel, we walked to try and find everyone. then we bumped into sofija, kate, etc, and we started walking to where sofija said the rest of the people were. but then we saw lisa and hannah, so we (i) stopped to talk to them. then we found the rest of the group, and sat down and talked and stuff, and i made mike go buy me some pizza. then erblina and vanessa left to find erin, then they came back (without erin), then they left again to find em and tim. but no such luck.  then they came back, and we all sat down together. and then we saw  morgan . it was my first time seeing her in like...3 years? yeah. it was so awesome... (she hasn't changed since grade 6. at all. it's sweet.)  then i took some pictures (some unsuspecting ones of mike, which are pretty funny), and then the fireworks started. i was like killing vanessa cuz i was lying on her... it was coo. then i realized that mike, evan, and that randy kid weren't with us anymore. and then we all saw mike running around, and apparently he was lost. i was laughing at him.  then the fireworks ended, and i walked with vanessa and erblina to meet vanessa's mom. then my cellphone wasn't working (to call my brother to pick me up), so i had to use vanessa's wayne's phone, and it took forever to arrange a pick-up place with my brother.  then i walked to true value hardware, and my brother drove me home. he was pissed off cuz he had to drive me, and he wanted to hang out with his friends more...i'm a bad sister.  and that was my night. it was so much fun... i wish canada day was EVERY DAY!  "i really like your shoes, kate."-randy "...thanks."-me "can i have them?"-randy "uh..no.."-me "no kate. i  really  like your shoes. CAN I HAVE THEM PLEASE."-randy  *as my mum dropped me off with all the guys...who were making noises and being "rebellious".* "...are you sure you're going to be ok with them?"-mum  "hey i love your LV purse!"-some girl talking to sylvia as we walked by. "...it's not real."-sofija "fine. don't fucking talk to me, bitch."-girl. ahaha  "i haven't had a hug from you for like...3 years!"-me "..oh, that's too bad."-morgan  *pulls out a flashlight that looks like a tampon.* "isn't this awesome?!"-sofija "what is that?!"-vanessa young "a flashlight!"-sofija "omg i thought it was a tampon!"-vanessa "yeah me too! hey, maybe it is. it's for those dark nights when you can't see anything. the light can help you in those situations."-brian  so anyways. that was my night! sweet, eh? woot.  so no plans for today... but 23 days till england. woot.  you always had the blondest hair.  kayte.

      erin erin erin...what can i say about erin?  with an infectious laugh, stunning good looks, and a singing voice to die for, she truly is an inspiration to us all. she always sees the good in people, and never judges people she doesn't even know.  we've been best friends since grade 7 (yes, i know what you're thinking. holy crap.), and have barely got in any fights. there are so many things that she has taught me about life, and has really changed me for the better. here is how:  i used to take everything seriously (shut up guys *cough*evan, i don't take things as seriously as i used to...ask erin.) i used to have lower self esteem...but now i [sometimes...] actually feel good about myself. i used to be so effing shy...but erin gave me the gift of confidence. haha. i used to be a loser...oh wait. i still am.  and there are many other ways that erin has changed me...  "you're so much more confident than you used to be."-my mum "yeah. i've been more confident since i've been friends with erin."-me "yeah. erin's been good for you."-my mum  aww. how cute. even my mum has noticed a change in me since erin. wow.  so i guess what i'm trying to say, is that i don't even want to think about what i'd be like without erin. she's always thurr to give me advice, and always knows what to do in a situation. [i love you, erin.]   say you won't care.   kayte.

       oh wow. my dad rocks.      i've been talking to my parents about getting a laptop, and my dad just gave me his. (it's a really good one too...a new-ish dell.)      "do you want my laptop?"-dad   "...umm...are you sure?"-me   "yeah. do you want it?"-dad   "umm yes...but what are you gonna have?"-me   "oh, i'll figure something out."-dad      wow. that was wierd...sweet.      well that's all.      and your heels look so beautiful against the carpet...   so graceful, yet so insecure.      kayte.

       hey dudes.      i am back. wow. what a holiday. so here we go.       monday  (26th):woke up at 4:30 am-ish. redcar picked me and my mum up at 5:30. got to toronto at 6:30-ish. wow my mum's so funny...we were just about to check in for our flight, and she was reading all the signs that said where to go and stuff, and she followed the sign that said "flights in canada"...as apposed to "flights leaving canada"...which was us. yeah. so anywho. we went through security (i didn't beep! i was so frikin happy...my mum beeped though. sucka), then we went to the gate and bought some food...then we waited for about half an hour, then we boarded the plane. flew. (to pass the time, i listened to my cd player, played 'word seeks', ate food...yeah that's about it. oh, and watched a movie. by the way, has anyone ever heard of the movie 'the station agent'? because seriously...what the hell. worst movie ever. and why would they show that on the plane? i'm sure no one's heard of it...ok so this is me stopping blabbing.) got to london-heathrow airport (that's in london, england) at around 9:30 (their time...so around 4:30 our time). took us about half an hour to get through customs and shiznit, then we got picked up by my aunt. she took us to her house, where we had snacks (yes. at around 10:30...we were having snacks. sweet.), then i went to bed.    tuesday : woke up semi-early. actually, got woken up. by my one year old cousin, matthew. (i love him.) showered, got dressed, then we went to the butterfly house thing...which, aside from having (yes, you guessed it)  butterflies , it had amphibians and reptiles and birds and monkeys and elephants. (well...not elephants. but i wish.) then we had lunch in a little cafe (prepared sandwiches...gonna miss those), and then had an ice cream. then we went to my aunt's house. (i think...it happened so long ago. frik i'm gonna forget half of the stuff i did.) then the usual thing. (i.e. supper, chatting, sleeping.)    wednesday : best day of my  life . minus the part when it kindof sucked...but i shall get to that later. my aunt (who i am now going to refer to as sue) took us to   legoland  ! aaaah. i was so excited...but then, since i was still kindof jet-lagged/tired, i didn't have much fun...and i must admit, i was a grumpykins. (note to self: never use that word again.) but legoland itself was pretty sweet...there were rides and food and...lego...there was a huge display of things made of lego, like buckingham palace, and cities from around the world. it was awesome. i went on a mini rollar coaster, a spinny thing, a spinny water thing...and lots more...i went with my 7 year old cousin. (kindof annoying, but whatev.) so yeah. we had a picnic lunch, then we went back to my aunt's house. (it was massively hot that day...i thought i was going to shoot myself or die before i could acquire a gun. one of the not fun parts.) then i got to go on msn! wow. i was excited...cuz i hadn't been on it for 3 days. ouch. kate with no msn for 3 days...total torture.    thursday : went to a place called kingston to shop! it was sweet...my mum had let me take all of my money out of my bank (about $410) to spend over in england/wales, so i was excited. i got a pair of beige cropped cords...they're sweet. i'm in love with them. and wear them everyday. (yeah...shut up.) i got some earrings too, and 2 belts. t'was coo. then we went to tgi friday's for lunch, where i fell in love (i fell in love a lot over my holiday) with marguiritas (spelling?). i had 2. (non-alcoholic of course. duh.) then we went back to sue's house, and sat around in the garden and i played with matthew.:). i enjoyed it...cuz he's small and cute and...loud.    friday : had a bit of a lie-in. (not really though...due to the fact that matthew is loud/talkative/rowdy when he wakes up.) then my aunt took us to windsor (home of windsor castle...the queen lives there most of the time). i got loads of souvenirs for people, took some pictures, then we went back to sue's house. shortly after arriving at sue's house (at around lunchtime), my other aunt (annie) arrived. she brought seafood with her, which her husband had caught. (he's a fisherman...named ashley. not kidding. he's a cool guy.) but anywho. the whole time that annie was thurr, she barely talked to me. i hadn't seen her for at least 5 years, and she didn't have anything to say to me. (we used to be really close when i was younger.) but whatever. then she stayed over night, and i got introduced to my new favourite show/the latest love of my life. big brother is the show, stuart wilson is the gorgeous man that i fell in love with. (he's only 20...is that rape?) but he was going out with another girl on big brother...but she got voted off the night i watched it. bahahaha. i laughed, while he cried. but don't worry stu, i love you. (p.s. she's a bitch anyway...and she's like 6 years older than him.)    saturday : my uncle and my cousin, sam [14] came to pick me and my mum up, and they drove us to wales. they also brought sam's stepbrother, jed (no relation to me). he's a cool/wierd guy...he talked for like an hour about 'a little mill that wasn't actually little at all'. so me and sam tried to listen to music while jed talked to anyone who would listen. we saw a few car accidents on the way up to wales, including 2 (seperate) cars thathad been completely flipped over and were roof-down. didn't look pretty. so eventually (after about 4 or 5 hours) we got to llanidloes (home of my other cousins...cat(herine) [14] and iain [18]. after about half an hour of being at their house, iain drove me and cat into town (they live in the middle of nowhere) to meet some of cat's friends...who are my friends too. cuz i talk to them on msn a lot...word. anywho. so i saw lucy and joby, and then i met two other guys (i forget their names...sorry), and a guy called martin who, apparently, wanted to 'shag' me. (i.e. have sex with me.) i was kindof scurred...no one wants to 'shag' me over hurr. (maybe that's not such a bad thing...seeing as i wouldn't do it anyway.) so yeah.after hanging out in llani, iain picked us up and took us home. then i semi-ate dinner, and cat's friends arrived for a sleepover/camp out thing in her field. yeah this is who came: lucy, joby, jess, matthew, ben, and josh. t'was sweet...we just sat outside by the fire (they were drinking...but i wasn't) and joby asked me questions about canada and stuff...then at like 12:30, i went inside and slept in a bed. muahaha. but yeah, it was really fun, and they were really nice people so it was sweet.    sunday : we all (two uncles, my aunt, 3 cousins, jed, my mum, and i) went to a lake/dam thing to have a picnic/swim...it was so much fun. jed was in a wet suit, and he was all wet from going in the [freezing] water, and he was sitting on this huge rock, and the way he was sitting on it made him look like gollum. it was awesome. so yeah, iain and sam were jumping from this cliff-type thing into the water...it was fun watching. and i made a movie thing of them jumping...but my mum lost the chip it was on (from the digital camera). anywho. after the lake/dam thing, we drove through borth and got an ice cream/popsicle, then drove home. then we just had like a lazy evening, and my aunt made an amazing dinner...she's awesome.    monday : left llani. :( . iain drove me and cat to aberystwyth so my grandparents' house, and picked up two of his friends on the way. (my mum and sam and jed went in another car with sam's dad)...so we got to my grandparents' house iain and his friends left, we had lunch, and went to the beach in borth. me, sam and cat attempted to go swimming...cuz it was cold and we kindof didn't want to. but when i say kindof didn't want to, i mean sam ran and dived in, while me and cat put our toes in it. then we went back up to where the parentals were sitting, and had a drink...then we went swimming again. and i made the mistake of pissing sam off by kicking water at him, so naturally he had to throw sand in my face. then me and cat ganged up on him, and we had a huge sand fight (in the water)...it was awesome. me and sam really bonded...considering i barely ever see him or talk to him. so then we got an ice cream, and went back to my grandparents' house. then i introduced sam to alexisonfire (he had never heard of them...wow. deprived child) and now he's gonna go buy the cd! wow i rock. so after making him listen to some of my music, he had to go back to llani...so he, jed and his dad left. then we had dinner, and me and cat watched coronation street, east enders, and [heart] big brother.    tuesday : woke up early-ish, and went into downtown aberystwyth with cat and shopped. it was sweet...i'm gonna miss her. i bought a paul frank shirt, a pair of earrings, a pin, and a watch. very successful. then we met up with my mum, and my grandma came to pick us up. then me and cat hung out in the room she was sleeping in and read magazines and talked and were 'sifting through weathered photo albums'. i.e. looking at pictures of when my mum and cat's dad were younger. (they're brother and sister.) it was cute. then i had a shower, and got dressed up to go to the theatre! so much fun. *cough*. we saw 'singin in the rain', and boy, was it entertaining. but there was one good thing about it...i saw a really 'fit' guy (fit=hot). and we made eye-contact. too bad it was actually cat he was making eye contact with. frik. then we went back to my grandparents' house after the show, and me and cat watched big brother. *grins*    wednesday : got up early and packed. then my grandparents drove us down to london, and on the way we dropped cat off in a town near llani where her dad was picking her up. and her dad came with sam, jed and sam's dad, so we got to say goodbye to them again...it was kindof sad. i sortof cried when we were driving away...but i hope i'll see them soon. anywho. then we continued our drive back to london, and it was pretty uneventful apart from the pit stops every now-and-then. yes. then we got to sue's house again, and waited like 5 minutes for her to get home from work. then we just relaxed for the rest of the day, and i played with matthew. *smiles*. then i watched big brother with sue and stuart (her husband/my uncle), and stu (the one i'm in love with on big brother) got voted off! aaah. i almost cried...cuz he's so frikin hot. and there would be no point in me watching it the next night. and wow...just wow.    thursday : tried to have a lie-in, but it was interrupted by matthew waking up and being noisey. we just had a lazy morning, and then sue drove me, my mum, matthew and william to the river thames for a walk. and we looked at boats and stuff, and took pictures. then it started to thunder and rain, so we kindof speed walked back to the car. then we got ice creams, and went to the grocery store where me and my mum bought 'picnic-y things' for the plane ride...like cocktail sausages and stuff. word. then we had a semi-big dinner since it was our last day/night there, and we went to sleep pretty early.    friday : woke up at 5:20 am, and packed and had a shower, etc. then sue drove us to the airport, and we said our goodbyes. then we did a bit of shopping in the airport, and got on our plane. and then we flew, obviously. the in-flight movie was better than the one on the way thurr...it was 'hidalgo', and if i'd have been able to see the screen, then i'm sure i would have enjoyed it more than 'the station agent'. we landed in toronto at around 11:30 am, and went through customs and passport checking and stuff. and originally, we were supposed to be picked up by a redcar (for those of you who don't know what a redcar is, it's kindof like a taxi, but it only takes you to and from the airport and your house or whatever). but as we were walking out of the arrivals thingy, my dad and brother were there to pick us up...so it was a pleasant surprise. and james actually hugged me...you know, like in front of people. wow. then they drove us home, and we gave them their presents and stuff.      "hey kate, how's that popsicle?"-iain   "haha i got it like all over my pants."-me   *looks at my pants*"wow. you really fucked up your trousers, didn't you?"-sam      *as we were meeting one of my grandparents' friends*   "wow, you've grown a lot since i last saw you."-friend, to sam. *whispers to me* "...what? i've never met him before...what is going on..."-sam      frik i suck so bad at these quotes...i should seriously think about writing them down as soon as they happen.    wow. that was my holiday...sweet, eh? i miss it though. it went by so quickly...i hope i go again soon. (i do apologize if any parts of my description of it don't make sense...because i am still slightly jet-lagged.      man, i was so frikin tired yesterday when i got home...went to bed at like 10. woor.      so i don't think i have many more plans for the rest of the summer...minus me and chloe maybe going to toronto for a day, to see the muchmusic vj's and go to the eatons centre and stuff...i hope it works out.      well, i'm out now. (you guys have no idea how long that took me to write.)      i'm scared of cracking up again-   i just want it to be like it was before.      kayte.      p.s. download 'thunderbirds are go' or '3 am' by busted...wow they're cool. despite the fact that they're pop-punk, they have some catchy songs.   ...shut up.      p.p.s. i love stuart from big brother, and i am going to marry him.
