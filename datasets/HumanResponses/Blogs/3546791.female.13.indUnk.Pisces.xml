      Heres what happened 2day... I changed The blog name Back to Just Another day...I think it sounds cooler that Jess Days.... At 1 in the Afternoon I had Soccer practice! I had a good time. And 2night The ppl that run the soccer in my town are gonna make the teams...Theres gonna be 2 teams and there gonna tell me wut team im on! The 1st Game Is this Monday!...This thing is so disogonised..its unbelieveble!..They only started making teams 2day cuz there was no coachs to take any teams,that and they wanted to make it "fare" so they had to see us play cuz some are better than others! (im not Bragging but Im 1 of the better ones)But its true some of these girls can do anything but its ok..i live with it! I have 4 7 years now! SO all is going well and I cant Wait to play on Monday. Monday is gonna be busy 4 me cuz i gotta study 4 2 exsams, And tahn play soccer and study some more. BUt I only Have about 4 exsams left so it'll be over soon and than i can go back to sleeping in till 11am! Dont know what else to put...Well Im listening to "Sweet Child O' Mine" By Guns N' Roses..Gun N' Roses are a great Band and their my Friend Mark fav band! Its a great Song too!:) Thats all 4 now! l8ter, Jess
