       Well I just had a lil taste of summer, but now I got let it sink in that I'm gone to summer school. Some times I think it wont be that bad... But then again it could royal suck. I'm going camping this Thursday too, so I'm gonna have to come back on Friday cuz summer school starts then.. How retarded is that!? You know what else is retarded? School, more then half the stuff we learn is never gone do us any good... So why take the effort in strangling to pay attention in class so we can know what to do for the agonizing hours of homework? To me.. It just makes no sence at all. O well, im almost done, next year is gr 12.. But im kinda scared.. I kinda know what I wanna do.. But I just don't know how to get there. Like colledge is fore sure I think... It would be so much easier if I could jus be a rock star lol... Oh that would be the life!  Yeah Kelsey and I are gonna start a band with some guys and were gonna be so awesome, and oh don't u worry, backstage passes will be promised to those who are loved lol... I rely do think its possible. You watch lol

       Holly man! I'm so angry! The main reason why I bought warped tour tickets was to see Billy talent and sugarcult and there not coming to Calgary! How messed up is that! So the only thing left to do is go to warped in Toronto... But I gotta get the money for that, and convince matt to come. I know this can so work! lol I have family there so its all good. How hard can it be to save up 500 dollars by august 14? Not hard? I hope not lol. It sux though I sorta have to take a vacation from work because I'm going camping YAY!! But that means 5 days of not working. Man I used to work almost every day with my old job, now sport checks got me working the shittiest hours, it rely bites, but o well, that's life, ill figure something out.. Always do lol C YA!

      Alright, so this is my first ...Post? Is that what this is called? lol anyways... So how many times have you herd some one say, "she's such a poser" "she doesn't even play guitar" "she thinks she's punk".. Yeah let me say this "bullshit" and yes, I'm talking about avril lavigne. And I would also like to say, what the hell are you people talking about? Your not up there singing to thousands of people, doing what she loves the most in life as her career! You don't know what its like to be in her shoes, she's who she is! And same goes to all the other so called "poser" artists out there. They worked hard to be where they are now and the last thing we should do is cut them down for making their dreams come true. How about take a look at yourself, and she where you have gone in life? Have you made any of your dreams come true? Or are u too busy analyzing those who have?   P.S. And about the hole, not playing guitars... Id like to inform u that AC/DC's lead singer.. Doesn't play guitar  OMG POSER RIGHT!?!?! Yeah, I don't think so.

Half way through and im like GET ME OUTA HERE! i hate the teacher so much, and that gurl stef.... oh howd id like to kick her prepy lil ass! id chop off that lil shilock nose of hers and shove it up her ass! shes just so retarted. And the teacher pisses me off to, she like yells her leassons lol i swear to god lol but first shell start off quiet, and then at the end of each sentence she is basicly yelling. so loud that it hurts my ears, and that is not an exaduration. I cant wait till this bullshits over. I oneslty think math is such a joke. like when in life wil i need to solve a gawdamn triangle? or liear equations? .. yeah.. hows about never? lol so why am i wasting&nbsp;4 years of my life in highschool, studying my ass off to get a diploma.. when what i did to get there... isent gonna benifit me... the only thing that will.. is getting the hell out of there, getting my diploma.. so when i go get a career i can say, ow look here! I just spent 4 years of my life studying bull shit, and they gave me this pica paper! ... now u can higher me cuz acording to this pice of paper.. im smart! lol little do they know that most of us in hight school bullshit our way trhough anyways, cheating on test, handing in home work that we didnt do.. our frinds in the grade higher then us did it last year..it took 10 min to copy.... but what ever.. no matter how much i say, i still find myself working towards graduation. 1 more year of it and thats it. I just wonder if colledge.. which ill hopfully be attending ... is going to be the same crap....

Everyones so cought up in stupid politics and pritty much all that matters is what the fucken leaders say... Id like to ask you, how many americans agree with Bush? last i herd 70% of em voted against&nbsp;his desisions! no lie. That is so pathetic, Bush doesent know what the hell hes doing. War doesnt solve shit! ... but what the hell, we all know this. so why am i talking about it.? screw that. lol.&nbsp;The funny thing is i used to hate america, and the americans, but i guess i canged my view.. sorta... the U.S. might be the stronget country in the world, but they cant stay like that forever, i think all this war is gonna tear them apart, eaither that or they need to get bush they fuck out of there. .. yeah.. i thought i said i would stop tlaking about this! lol y dont i just stop talking all together lol
