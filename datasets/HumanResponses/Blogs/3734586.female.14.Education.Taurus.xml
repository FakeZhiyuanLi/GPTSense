Got a chance to chat wif him on phone. Haha... How i wish i can tok to him face to face, den can his shy shy look!! So cute lei... Tml school reopen liao can see him liao dun nid to miss him like siao. :) Really jus a chat wif him is enough for mi to be happy for one whole day. He really can brighten up my life. Jus really wish that we can be together lor. Wat i am sad of is that we both like each other but we cannot be together. Sob sob. I really like him.

      I really dun noe wat am i thinking of, is so confusing and sad. Really very sad. Now jus feel like giving up everything tat i haf rite now. Sob sob... May be i really lost confidence on him and may be is true tat we r impossible to be together. I really very tired of living liao. Who can tell mi wat should i do now?! Rite now, my heart already break and is very pain, jus feel like crying out. Everyday i am very sad but i have to act in front of my friends as if i am very happy but i am not. Every second every minute inside my heart is crying. No one on the earth understand how i feel. Now i really very confusing. I ask before myself tat i treat him as a friend or the one i love but i cant even answer it. I really dun wish to hurt anyone around mi. He is very innocent, this is the first time he falls in love with a gal, i really really very scare one day i will hurt him. I really dun noe wat should i do. He is quite a nice guy but i cant bare to hurt him. Should i give up or should i not?! Why guys alway like that treat a gal? When they happy then reply, not happy then dun reply. HAve they thought of our feelings?! Everytime is the gal who sacrify for them, but dun seem that they sacrify for us!! Why cant they jus settle down for one minute and think of our feelings?! Why must they treat us like tat?! Now i have fear by last time relationship, i dun dare or try to in love. Cos is really very hurt. When the gal's heart is break, it will never ever glue back cos there will sure got memories inside our mind. No matter how hard i try, i cant erase away the memories. Although is sweet, it is hurt!! I really hope tat he is the one i can rely on but i think my wish will nv ever come true. I really cant believe i will cry cos of him. Very stress arghhh... Why do people dun noe how to treasure things when it is still present, why must they start to treasure them after the things have gone?!! Now i dun even dare to message him liao. Reaaly dun noe wat to do?! Can anyone tell mi?! Sob Sob...

      Haiz... I jus dun noe why i feel so moody this few days. Erm, i also dun noe wat am i thinking about. I jus wanna to have a simple life that all... Jus take or break anything u all wanna to break. i really cant take the life liao. I dun wanna to hurt anyone around mi especially him. Jus dun have the feeling to hang in there and jus wanna to give up. i am the one who cause everything bad in the world to happen... I am jinx to everyone. I cant get into a relationship and i will not let myself hurt anyone.  I really dun have anything to raise my confidence up, i jus feel that everything is all my fault. If i nv be in the world, those thing will not happen. So wat he like mi, i cant give him any happiness. I think i should jus keep quiet and leave myself to settle my emotion. Why mus everyone say i like him, i dun like him. I DUN LIKE HIM. Tat is enough i dun LIke him. I DUN LIKE MEAN I DUN LIKE. Everyone is teasing him, i noe the stress. Summore he still have to concentrate on his studies... I dun wanna to be wif him... happy liao.... I DUN LIKE CHEN YU HENG!!! Sob sob...
