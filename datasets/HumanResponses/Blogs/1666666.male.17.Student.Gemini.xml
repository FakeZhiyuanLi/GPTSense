						   After leaving my main venting place,  urlLink DeviantART.com , due to conflicting interests, I knew I'd need to set up something similar to provide the same effect for me, and for those without the advantage of being able to avoid me. I can't say much has changed in the past couple of months. I'm still going for my GED, though, somehow or another, I may be able to get my diploma simply for passing the GED test. You won't hear me complaining at all, but I'm not certain it's the best thing for me. I'm not certain if I'm academically deserving of a high school diploma. Will future jobs begin to expect out of me, things that I can't give them because of this? Speaking of jobs, I applied at Walgreens and Hollywood Video in the past week. If I'm not mistaken, they're holding tests at the Career Center next week, so I don't believe there will be any laps in schedule, should I be hired to work any either of the aforementioned locations. It's going on midnight now, thought, so I guess I'll be going to bed now. Goodnight everybody!

						   My stepdad was drinking, not surprisingly, the day Vacation Bible School started at my church. I hadn't planned on going up there and helping out but I didn't feel safe here alone with my stepdad after what he did (and it was his own fault, too).   For a long time now, my stepdad used his truck purely to get to work and back. Any time he, him and my mom, or anybody at all went anywhere, it was in my mom's car. When he referred to the car, he would call it "our car," as in "my car too." However, anytime he'd refer to the truck, he'd call it "my truck," as in " only  my truck." This is what he called them, and this is how they were used for years. (Truth be told, my mom's car was actually purchased for her by my real dad! I know he would have kept it for himself if he knew divorce lingered around the corner. Even so, my stepdad has the nerve to call it "our car." It amazes me.) My mom  finally  (as usual) got tired of the vehicles usage patterns, and took away the copy of the car key that he had, apparently without his knowledge. So one day, for reasons unknown, his truck (a '99 model Ford F-250 Super Duty) is parked  in  our  one-car  carport. It fits, sure; but barely. I'm not sure who was using the car that day, (a family at our church, and close friends of our family, was in a car accident, so my mom may have been letting them use it at the time, I don't really remember anymore) but the car was in the driveway behind the truck. If the truck is ever in the driveway, (which is rare) it's always behind the car, and precisely to prevent exactly what occurs on this day. There is ample room in the driveway outside of the car port, but for some reason, on this day, he wanted to make it fit inside the car port. He succeeded at this, only to realize (all too late)  what goes in must come out , and by this time, the car is parked behind the truck. As I mentioned before, his copy of the car key was apparently taken without him knowing. Because of this guy's laziness (his own fault), drunkenness (his own fault), and pure outright stupidity ("birth defect" is no excuse!), the car remained parked directly behind the truck in the driveway as he began his attempt at backing out of the car port while avoiding the side of the house, and 3 solid brick columns (2 on the left, 1 on the right) that support the car port hanging over the driveway, extending off of the house. Don't forget: the car is still behind him. I hear the sound of something falling and breaking as the house vibrates. I was in the living room, which is what's on the other side of the wall he was trying to avoid. I heard the truck crank up and I heard the breaking sound maybe 15 seconds afterwards, and I think to myself, "I couldn't get this lucky...!" I looked outside to find that I had gotten just that lucky. With   his   truck (and probably single-handedly), he had taken out the left column supporting the car port, along with probably something like five to ten thousand dollars in property value. My mom ran out from the bedroom franticly to see what had happened. Without thinking, I inadvertently allowed my amusement to enter my voice and said, "Dude! Larry just hit the house with his truck!" The door was open as my mom went outside to assess the damage, and I could hear him cursing and crying.  As I said before, I wasn't about to stay home alone with this guy, so I went with my mom to the church to help with Vacation Bible School. It actually turned out to be fun. Monday was slow, Tuesday I helped count pennies, which was more fun than it probably sounds. Wednesday through Friday, I helped my mom with the class she was teaching, which, if I remember correctly, was 5th through 6th grade girls. They were great kids; very well-mannered and obedient (for the most part). I really look forward to seeing (hopefully) most of them again next year.

						   I went to Houston, Texas, with a couple of my cousins last week. We went to Six Flags Astroworld something like three times. Overall, it was rainy the whole time, but it kept the crowds away so the lines were all but gone. All in all, I had fun. The church even sent me a post card while I was gone, letting me know that I was missed. I've been taking the California achievement Test this week. I think I'm finished with it at this point, but it took me two days just to get through the math portion, so I'm really not sure. Two days of math was really hard to survive, considering my skills and usefulness in that subject. My teacher, however, seems has found a way to possibly get me some kind of certification with Cisco Systems. I had never imagined this to be possible, especially at this age, but you'll never hear me arguing! The process won't start at least until August, so I have some time to read up on more stuff, and better prepare myself; but I'm completely excited about this.

						   I remember when they first brought Midnight home. She was only about the length of my fore-arm. I can't believe how much that dog has grown! I was against the idea of having any animals in the first place. I knew how the situation would end up. My mom would decide it'd be better off somewhere else, but Larry, my stepdad, wouldn't agree. He'd want to keep the dog, while not actually taking care of it... kind of like Seth (my BROTHER!). As I predicted, the situation is exactly that. The original idea was to get Seth used to being around dogs so he wouldn't grow up the way I did: petrified of dogs (the cause of which I'm still unaware of to this day). Anyways, it's a lost cause at this point, because if she were to send up on her two hind legs, she'd be taller than I am! This obviously doesn't help the situation with Seth. It actually makes everything in the back yard worse. I went out to our "library" in the storage building to get as many of my old books as I could. With my waterbed out and a long twin-sized bed in my room, I have more room with nothing to fill it with, so I plan on building a shelf to hold everything from DVD's, to CD's, to all my books and whatever else I can get to fit. I had forgotten how many books had accumulated over just the past couple of years. I had to make four trips from the storage building to the house. Of course, the storage building is in the back yard... with the dog. That's what brings up this whole subject. I really can't wait 'till we're able to get rid of her. Don't get me wrong, though. It's not that I totally dislike her, and I'm definitely not abusive or anything like that. The thing is, the only person who ever really goes in the back yard is Larry, and that's only to do his smoking and drinking, so I know she's not getting any love from him, especially during those times (note plural) in his days. She would just have a better life elsewhere, not to mention it would also take away quite a few responsibilities away from us, and with my mom starting her new job, she could use a reduction in responsibilities.  Oh yeah, if I haven't mentioned it yet, my mom got a new job! She's a teacher (so to speak) at Shreveport Christian Academy. I happen to have a few friends there so the thought of it sometimes borders awkwardness, but I'm just glad she'll be getting paid! Now if I could just find a job for myself, I might actually consider myself flat out happy.
