      Ok... Shelly and I were listening to live prayer a few days ago. It comes on UPN at 1am out of Tampa, Florida. Anywho, I tried calling in then and called in tonight. Anywho, this pretty much explains it.  "Oh my god. so, in florida here we have this show that airs on UPN at 1 AM called "Live Prayer" Its where people call in with their problems, complaining to a bullshit pastor, and he prays for them, to the lord. Hes basically homophobic, and he thinks being gay will lead to a very destructive road. So, anyway. My online buddy/friend George, lives in Virginia. I usually talk through voice chat with him, and put the mike up next to the tv too. So, I was letting him listen to live prayer, and he decided next time it was on, hed call in, and say he was gay.  So, anyway, i had the mike right next to the TV, and my computer sound recorder ready, and was watching him on cam. So, he had his phone ready, they said he would be through soon, talking to the pastor. And then all of a sudden i heard on TV "Ok, we have George with us. George, what is your problem?"   George:" Hi, yeah, im gay" (Or something like that)  And the pastor talked about how to help him stop being gay. But there were some seriously funny moments. The priest dude asked george to turn down his tv (he wasnt watching it on the tv, just listening to it through voice chat), so george was like "ok" And then I swear, there was the longest pause ever. The priest dude was waiting for George to say something, and George was waiting for the priest dude to say something. George was like just sitting there, and the pastor had the most confused look on his face, and was staring at the camera. Finally he went "George, are you there?"   And George said "yeah"  And then he went on, preaching about gays, and it was the funniest thing. I was trying to muffle my laughter because i was afraid theyd hear me through the mike. And I kept seeing George giving huge "silent" laughs. And he even typed "lmao" while talking to him.   Then at the very end of the conversation, he prayed for George. George hung up by the time he was praying for him through :-P  Then like two callers later I think, some dude called in talking about himself and... GEORGE! LMFAO! omg.  So, anyway. I recorded the whole thing. Feel free to IM me on aim if ya want to listen to it :-P :-D  God that was some funny shit."  Taken from Fedora Black Widow. Shelly's blog.     urlLink   urlLink

      I went to the concert and didn't get home until 1 in the morning. Firt up was nelson  urlLink   who played a few acoustic songs (well... they're pretty much folk musicians) that went to the top ten charts in the US and in other countries of the world. Peter Frampton... god... I mean... that guy is getting old, but he's lively as hell. I mean... just his attitude. Coupled with the fact that I actually met him right after. Styx was loud. I mean unbelievably loud... and Lawrence Gowan came out dressed in a Mountie's jacket (he's canadian)... oh, and during peter frampton's set, Tommy Shaw was the one handing him his guitars and everything. There were, as Peter said, a lot of hijinks going on, as it was the last show of the Frampton/Nelson/Styx tour. And I forgot to mention, for those of you who don't know, Gunnar and Matthew Nelson are the two sons of Rick Nelson... and their grandparents were also top 10 musicians. They hold the Guiness Book of World Records for the only three generations to hip #1 on the charts.  Other than the concert, post concert, I bought a tour shirt and my dad got a shirt and a hat and the Peter Frampton part of the concert was actually recorded there and he bought a copy of that. I'm actually listening to it right now.  We got lost a few times and spent about an hour trying to get back on interstate 64.  I want to see another concert there this year. I liked that amphitheatre (this was actually my first time at the virginia beach amphitheatre. Anywho, I swam for about an hour before the concert at the oceanfront on 17th street in VA Beach. To tell you the truth, it wasn't really crowded until it got later there. I think styx was a little overkill on the bass. They had 7 ampeg full bass stack amplifiers. 6 Marshall stacks for the guitars.... that was a bit under. They need more like 12 marshalls. The drums and the bass in unison were rattling my ears after the concert and everything that was trebly was rattling my ears. Peter Frampton has a guitar that's one serial number off of mine (a Gibson Les Paul 1960 RI... something I already knew)... but his had like... midi and roland synthesizer stuff on it and mine has pickup covers. Anywho... anough of my babbling.  Music - While My Guitar Gently Weeps - Peter Frampton Mood - (lmao, I actually typed food before when I meant mood) Hungry... I haven't eaten anything since two pm yesterday.... so I haven't eaten in almost 24 hours. Other than that, i'm tired and my hearing is still screwed up, but overall, i'm quite satisfied and happy.

      So, I was up last night until 4:00 am talking to Shelly as usual. This was funny as hell. Anyways, she was listening to a "liveprayer" thing on tv. She had the microphone on so I can hear it. Anywho, we were listening to it and there was a girl who was 16 on there saying she was a bisexual and he was saying (the pastor on the liveprayer thing) the bisexuality doesn't exist.. etc. etc. and you would pay the consequences (in a nutshell, he said change your ways or burn in hell) and rambled. Anyways, I had my webcam on and she said "George, you should call in".. so, i've done stuff like this before when we tried to get pedophile phone numbers and call them and screw with their heads. LMAO... anyway, she gave me the number and I kept hanging up and hitting redial till it was answered. The first two times, I was hung up on and at one point the person answering the phones said I was up next. Then it hung up on me. Then right at the end of the show, the pastor answered and went "the show is over, aight?" and then someone called back from there and I answered and they hung up on me. Weird. That was funny as shizzleeeeee. I want to try it again tonight (the show airs every night with all these screwed up people calling in wanting to pray"... but what was also funny was that the pastor was saying homosexuality led to drug and alcohol abuse and your life would be bad and you'd be confused. Then he told that 16 year old girl on the line that gays commit suicide and do drugs more. I mean... who cares. As long as they are happy with life.  By the way. Being a democrat, I am pro-gay rights because I believe people should have more options in life and they shouldn't follow a "you can't do that!" type of life. Do as you please unless you are hurting another... it should be your choice to have these freedoms. Anti-abortionists piss me off sometimes like that. I mean, yes, I feel, being a vegan, everything should have the chance to live, but if Jim Bob pulls you off the street and forces you to have sex with him and rapes you and you find out your pregnant with the baby of some fucked up loser who couldn't care less, what would you do? The baby didn't do anything wrong. But say you're 14,15,16,17.... around there.... would you want to give birth to it? I sure as hell wouldn't want to. The thought of having your own child is scary enough as it is.   The power went out last night at 4 while I was talking to shelly and I usually keep a red flashlight next to the pencil cup on my desk just in case it ever happens and my dad moved it into the kitchen. So I dug around in the dark... holding a $1,500 guitar... afraid i'm going to run into the wall with it or drop it. I stepped on a quill tipped pen (that felt great) and fell down the stairs waking everyone up when I went upstairs to get the emergancy lantarn and down to the basement, I tripped over my mom's sandals while getting candals and batteries..... then the lighters wouldn't work because they were outside in the rain. Then I found my dad's windless glow lighter thing outside on the floor of the porch... I stayed up till 4ish. Then I awoke to the power being on (yay). I'm going to see Styx, Peter Frampton, and Nelson in concert tomorrow night at the virginia beach verizon wireless amphitheatre. I have 6th row seats in the gold circle reserved area. So.. yay for me. My dad saw styx in 1976.

         I probably had a lot of time to post as I pretty much have too much time on my hands as it is. I stayed up for 37 hours.... shelly was on AIM until 6 am the day before yesterday and I wrote a song and she said she was going to bed so I said I was staying on to write a song so... I thought "15 more minutes, George" and I ended up finishing the song and going for a bike ride around 7. I was supposed to go to ride the trails down at the Beaverdam Resevoir/Lake, I was too tired (still am :P). My mom and I took my grandmother to the doctor to get her back checked out. Borrrrrrring... had to watch Dr.Phil. I don't care for that trashy stuff.... well, it's good for a laugh sometimes, but come on, I don't even think the dude even has a real doctorates... and Oprah was the one who got him a show.      I went to the guitar shop, played a few new guitars that came in and there was a guy who was playing loud and I couldn't play because it would get all jumbled up since I couldn't tell who was playing what sometimes. lmao. I fell asleep (finally) last night... and it had to be while talking to Shelly. (:P I laid on my bed to read a guitar magazine that I got and I fell asleep...)... I hate when that happens. Anywho, I don't have anything too interesting to post. Just letting you know i'm still alive.  ~ George Mood: Tired and Aching from being sleep deprived... Basically, I feel fine except for that. :P  Music: I think I listened to Moby on my bathroom stereo while in the shower yesterday, other than that, i'm listening to Jimmy Buffett right now.  TV: I'm watching The Today Show on NBC... Jimmy Buffett is performing on the today show at the moment. I went to a Jimmy Buffett concert by myself. To tell you the truth, it was pretty strange. These people next to me were friendly before the concert then they started taking ecstasy and they started freaking out and left during the intermission... I had a really good seat and were on the middle level in the front row and there was this girl who was maybe around 16 and it was funny because she took her shirt off and asked if she could have my seats because she thought someone else was with me... Funny how they say "sex sells"... she didn't have to do that. lmao.

      So... ya know. I went to the bike/skate shop place today. My dad brought his bike to get a new seat put on and he got some stuff adjusted on it... then I got myself a road bike with treadless tires... well, they have tread, but they're smooth. I also put a light on it for riding at night. It has a high beam and a low beam... all for a grand total of 414.00ish dollars. A little while ago I rode about a mile down to the post office off of main street and mailed a money order.. then I came home.  My pants fell down once or twice when I jumped off the bike a couple times... well.. I didn't jump off... I flew off when I locked up the brakes too quick when I was jumping this bump thing going over a hill. It was rather strange. I enjoyed it quite much. Anywho... there was this dude at the shop (he is the owner) and he said he weighed 350 pounds and he was showing us his gut and stuff... that was strange. Then I went to wendy's and got a side salad and fries. Dum de doo de dum. That's it. I'm going to find something to watch on TV.  Music - Moby - 18 album TV - It isn't on yet, but i'm going to turn it on. Mood - satisfied, happy.

      Good Morning... just a litle future non-fiction tale to brighten the day.  One sunny day in 2005, an old man approached the White House from across Pennsylvania Avenue. He spoke to the secret service agent standing guard and said, "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush." The secret service agent looked at the man and said, "Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here." The old man said, "Okay, thank you sir" and walked away. The following day, the same man approached the White House and said to the same secret service agent, "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush." The secret service agent again told the man, "Sir, as I said yesterday, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here." The man thanked him and, again, just walked away. The third day, the same man approached the White House and spoke to the very same secret service agent, saying "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush." The secret service agent, understandably agitated at this point, looked at the man and said, "Sir, this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to Mr. Bush!!! I've told you already that Mr. Bush is no longer the president and no longer resides here anymore. Don't you understand?!?!?!?" The old man looked at the secret service agent and said, "Oh, I understand. I just love hearing it." The secret service agent snapped to attention, saluted, and said, "See you tomorrow."  Well, i'm off to take a shower and get ready. I'm going to the bike shop in a bit and since i've been stealing my father's uncomfortable mountain/cruiser hybrid crossover bike, he's taking me to go get one... I haven't ridden a bike in like... two or three years until a couple days ago. I'm going to get a cruiser/road bike... since I ride on the backroads off of main street in the evening.. There's hardly any cars around and the temperature is always moderate and more comfortable in the evening/night... Well, i've spent enough time with with this post. I'm off.   Mood - Happy, hurried TV - TBS Music - That song wouldn't it be nice if we were older by the Beach Boys keeps playing over in my head, other than that, the last thing I listened to was someone's personal mp3s on soundclick.com  ~ George

      ::yawn::... feeling somewhat tired. My mom went off to Virginia Beach with her friend and her friend's daughter today. I don't really like Virginia Beach. The laws are too strict and it's kind of crazy there. I stayed up till about 4:15 am last night talking to Shelly and watching TV... Don't have any new news really. I haven't eaten since last night around... I guess 11:00 am. I had vegan chili. Today is a fairly beautiful day... but I really don't have anything to do outside. I might go for a bike ride or something tonight. I haven't ridden a bike in... 2 or 3 years. My dad bought a new one a few days ago so he could ride it. Nice temperature today and not a cloud in the sky. ::checks weather station:: 81.0 degrees... anywho, as soon as I get motivated enough, i'm going to pick some stuff up off of my desk, make my bed, and fix something to eat. I need to stretch. George  Mood: Still aching from Water Country, Tired, Lazy. Music: Last listened to "Grace" by Jeff Buckley about 30 minutes ago. TV: Watching American Chopper on the Discovery Channel.

      from the orlando sentinel:  Conservative for Kerry Vote For A Man, Not A Puppet  -Charley Reese   Americans should realize that if they vote for President Bush's re-election, they are really voting for the architects of war Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and the rest of that cabal of neoconservative ideologues and their corporate backers. I have sadly come to the conclusion that President Bush is merely a front man, an empty suit, who is manipulated by the people in his administration. Bush has the most dangerously simplistic view of the world of any president in my memory.   It's no wonder the president avoids press conferences like the plague. Take away his cue cards and he can barely talk. Americans should be embarrassed that an Arab king (Abdullah of Jordan) spoke more fluently and articulately in English than our own president at their joint press conference recently.  John Kerry is at least an educated man, well-read, who knows how to think and who knows that the world is a great deal more complex than Bush's comic-book world of American heroes and foreign evildoers. It's unfortunate that in our poorly educated country, Kerry's very intelligence and refusal to adopt simplistic slogans might doom his presidential election efforts.  But Thomas Jefferson said it well, as he did so often, when he observed that people who expect to be ignorant and free expect what never was and never will be.   People who think of themselves as conservatives will really display their stupidity, as I did in the last election, by voting for Bush. Bush is as far from being a conservative as you can get. Well, he fooled me once, but he won't fool me twice.  It is not at all conservative to balloon government spending, to vastly increase the power of government, to show contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law, or to tell people that foreign outsourcing of American jobs is good for them, that giant fiscal and trade deficits don't matter, and that people should not know what their government is doing.   Bush is the most prone-to-classify, the most secretive president in the 20th century. His administration leans dangerously toward the authoritarian. It's no wonder that the Justice Department has convicted a few Arab-Americans of supporting terrorism. What would you do if you found yourself arrested and a federal prosecutor whispers in your ear that either you can plea-bargain this or the president will designate you an enemy combatant and you'll be held incommunicado for the duration?   This election really is important, not only for domestic reasons, but because Bush's foreign policy has been a dangerous disaster. He's almost restarted the Cold War with Russia and the nuclear arms race. America is not only hated in the Middle East, but it has few friends anywhere in the world thanks to the arrogance and ineptness of the Bush administration.  Don't forget, a scientific poll of Europeans found us, Israel, North Korea and Iran as the greatest threats to world peace.   I will swallow a lot of petty policy differences with Kerry to get a man in the White House with brains enough not to blow up the world and us with it. Go to Kerry's Web site (www.johnkerry.com) and read some of the magazine profiles on him. You'll find that there is a great deal more to Kerry than the GOP attack dogs would have you believe.

         Hello all. Yesterday I went to Water Country with Josh and his older sister, her friends, their cousin Patrick... etc. We spent all day there and I made a side salad with soy chicken and italian dressing in it and a soy bologna sandwich... spent all day there and we were pretty tired. It was a fun day. Some of the strangest topics came up during the whole time with them... and we were having fun and as we were getting into a raft at the top of one of the rides, I started talking with a lisp and there was this dude there, Eric from Canada, as his name tag said on the whistle cord on his neck and I said "Well hello, super sexy man" and as we went down, I went, "have a fabulous day." Also... nearing the closing of the park, around 5:30... there were some people about our age and they were trying to run ahead of us and they knocked Amanda, Josh's sister, down, and I helped her up and we never caught up to the guys. But, anyway, about 15 minutes later, we went on the ride again, and the guys tried to do it again, now I like pacifism, but, this was actually funny. As the guys tried to do it again, Amanda was in front of me and I went "look behind us" and they were running up. And as they tried to elbow her, she went "awww, hell no!!!" and threw one of them into a big rubbermaidish type trash can on the edge of the trail going to the slide. Then the other dudes behind the guy in front tried to chase us and I told her to run and I grabbed the trash can and threw it in the path and yelled "Up yours" and ran. Funny as hell. After we changed and everything, I came back and picked the trash can up.... because nobody else would really care to.      After that, we left and drove on Interstate 64 looking for a place to eat, we drove and there was a really bad thunderstorm and we saw a few funnel clouds and we drove all the way up to Lightfoot, a small town on the outskirts of Williamsburg. We ate at a Wendy's there, came home, and Patrick dropped me off... that was pretty much it for the day. I talked to Shelly and I was so tired... she said "brb" and I laid down on my bed within viewing range of the monitor and fell asleep and woke up at 8:00 am. Unbelievable. Already 6:00 pm... June 19th... summer is going fast.     I could go for some popcorn right now. I mean movie theatre style. Yummy. I found that the margarine at the theatre here is non-dairy... vegan popcorn. Yay.. I just found my remotes. It was under my blankets. I need to finish boxing up one of my guitars I sold. I was thinking about buying a new strat, building my own (too much trouble but i'll have something special and what I like when i'm done... in a nitrocellulose finish), a Jackson soloist, or an Ibanez. Something strat style but with a kick to it. Maybe i'll just get another Gibson Les Paul. Anywho... i'm out.  Mood - Disgusted (I need to pick stuff up off of my desk, pick stuff up off of the bed, and make my bed), Aching (sunburn and leg cramps), a bit tired. A little Hungry.  What music I last listened to - Jimi Hendrix, Moby - Landing.  What i'm watching on TV - Spy Hard... I can use a little Leslie Nielson slapstick humor once in a while... not that it's really funny... i've seen this movie a bunch of times.

      It's almost 1 am and I have to be up around... 7:00 or 8:00 am... and it seems as if the tables have turned and I am now going to be going to Busch Gardens instead of Water Country tomorrow. Josh's cousin, Patrick, is supposedly taking his friend, Josh, his older sister Amanda, her friend heather, and I to water country... if we can all fit into his Ford Explorer. Then, I had to beg my mom to pick us up and she's going to around 5:00... but she wasn't too happy about it because she goes to the Riverside Wellness and Fitness center AKA "the gym" religiously... I think, Monday, Wendnesday, Friday, Saturday morning, and Sunday.... and if she goes to the gym on those days, she will not miss one class. I had to quit working and taking guitar lessons because she couldn't drive me on monday evenings because it was a pain for her and a pain for me because as soon as I got home from school at 3:00, I had just enough time to make a veggie burger, eat, check my e-mail, and go and be back with about 2 minutes left for her to change her clothes at the gym and get set up after dropping me off at home. My dad bought this bathroom cleaner chlorine bleach spray stuff because I had mold in my bathroom, and while I was doing something earlier, he came in and sprayed the corners of the wall where it was growing in the shower and he didn't wash it out and never told me he didn't. So after a few hours, I am coughing and choking and he came in asking me if allergies were bothering me and I said "It's the bleach" and I ask if he ever rinsed it and he said he didn't. So I wash the tub and all around it and it's still making me cough, sneeze, and choke. Don't get me wrong, I love the smell of an indoor swimming pool, But i'm not fond of choking on bleach or chlorine fumes. Anywho... it's 12:50... and I have a few to spare. The average person falls asleep in 7 minutes. Hmm... I was about to post and thought "average person"... that was worded wrong. Most people fall asleep in an average of 7 minutes is what I meant. Anywho, posting my moods. I'm out. Much love.   Mood - Agitated, sleepy, bored, anxious Music/Sound - The clickity click of my keyboard, my feet squeaking as I scratch my toe on the hardwood floor, the whirr of the wall unit air conditioner, the fan on my computer hard drive.

      I often say "carpe diem" instead of a cuss word... not because i'm afraid of saying one... but just because it's more interesting. Carpe Diem means seize the day, as you probably know, in latin... I don't often say it... (speak it) I mostly think it.. or say it while i'm talking on AIM. Crap... i'm getting off topic. Anywho, I forgot my ling. Ugh. Dum dum de doo dum. Anywho.. i'm going to Water Country in williamsburg, va tomorrow with my friend-ish person i've known since I was about two. His mom used to babysit me back then... Anywho.. i'm going with him, his older sister Amanda and her friend Heather who used to be their neighbor before they moved to maine and I used to live down the street from them before I moved to Downtown Gloucester as opposed to the old farm we lived on back then. And they live down in pretentious cocksucker land in the Powhatan Chimney area in Wicomoco on the waterfront. All of the people there seem to be stuck up and have too much money.... their neighbor is supposedly in the mafia and owns a restaurant or something. There's a big dude who drives a big old Cadillac elderado.. like a 70s-ish pimpmobile car that's red. He always parks down the street and walks to the house and comes in the back door at their neighbor's house. Anywho.. I keep getting off topic.  Mood - Somewhat busy... yet bored... yet, I feel like i'm doing something and don't feel like being around people. I feel odd. I always feel odd. I guess i'm... fine. :-p  Music - I'm listening to the sounds of my typing but if I was listening to music, i'd probably be listening to... erm... let's see.... something... soundscapish.... maybe moby's 18 album.   Oh crap crap crap. I suck at HTML. Anywho.. if you want to see my photo album. Copy and paste this link below, into your address bar.   urlLink ">

      Here's a link to my photo album... pictures of myself in there... artwork... editing i've done to people's photos... pictures of shelly... etc. etc. Anywho. Ugh... I can't get the picture Shelly sent me out of my head.

      A computer crash erased detailed records from Miami-Dade County's first widespread use of touchscreen voting machines, raising again the specter of elections troubles in Florida, where the new technology was supposed to put an end to such problems.  The crashes occurred in May and November of 2003, erasing information from the September 2002 gubernatorial primaries and other elections, elections officials said Tuesday. The malfunction was made public after the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition, a citizen's group, requested all data from the 2002 gubernatorial primary between Democratic candidates Janet Reno and Bill McBride. In December, officials began backing up the data daily, to help avoid similar data wipeouts in the future, said Seth Kaplan, spokesman for the county's elections supervisor, Constance Kaplan.  The loss of data underscores problems with the touchscreen voting machines, the citizen's group said. "This is a disaster waiting to happen," said Lida Rodriguez-Taseff, chairwoman of the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition. "Of course it's worrisome."  The group is concerned about the machines' effectiveness, following revelations about other problems with the system. Last month, state officials said the touchscreen systems used by 11 counties had a bug that would make a manual recount impossible. Earlier this month, a newspaper study indicated touchscreen machines did not perform as well as those that scanned paper ballots.  Also Tuesday, election reform groups asked a judge to strike down a state rule preventing counties that use the machines from conducting manual recounts from them.  State election officers say manual recounts are not needed since the machines tell each voter if they are skipping a race, known as an undervote, and will not let them vote twice for the same race, known as an overvote. The officials also maintain that the computer systems running the machines can be trusted to count the votes accurately as they're cast, and give the final numbers when needed.  But lawyers representing the ACLU and other groups said the state should require a paper trail in case a physical recount is needed, as it was in the 2000 presidential race in Florida. "I have concern about votes that are cast but not recorded," said Howard Simon, executive director for ACLU of Florida.  Election supervisors from some of the 15 counties using touchscreens had asked the state if they would need to go through the laborious process of printing screen images of each ballot during a recount. The Division of Elections then ruled that state law only requires a recount to determine voters' intent, and that it is impossible to question voter intent with touchscreen ballots.  Florida counties without the touchscreen machines use optiscan technology, in which computers read voters' pencil marks on paper ballots, and would be able to do physical recounts in tight races. Administrative Law Judge Susan B. Kirkland has 30 days to make her decision after receiving the hearing transcript, which is due back in 10 working days.  Florida's voting system has been under scrutiny since the 2000 debacle, when it took five weeks of legal maneuvering and some recounting before Republican George W. Bush was declared president.  &nbsp; So you heard it folks... yet another crash of the digital voting machines. And is there anything you can do about it?&nbsp;You could start here  urlLink http://www.moveon.org &nbsp;by signing to petition on their site to get rid of digital voting machines and get manual voting machines. There's good points to digital, but in my opinion, digital voting machines are a bit shady. You can't trust anybody. Heyyyyyyyy Mr. Clean, you're dirty now too.  ~ George Snow

      david lettermens top 10 on friday: george w bush's top 10 complaints about farenheit 9/11....   10. That actor who played the President was totally unconvincing  9. It oversimplified the way I stole the election  8. Too many of them fancy college-boy words  7. If Michael Moore had waited a few months, he could have included the part where I get him deported  6. Didn't have one of them hilarious monkeys who smoke cigarettes and gives people the finger  5. Of all Michael Moore's accusations, only 97% are true  4. Not sure - - I passed out after a piece of popcorn lodged in my windpipe  3. Where the hell was Spider-man?  2. Couldn't hear most of the movie over Cheney's foul mouth  1. I thought this movie was supposed to be about dodgeball   As we all know, this is the week of the democratic national convention in boston.and in watching the speakers speak and the delegates, well, delegate, it makes me think about the democratic platform vis-a-vis the republican platform.shouldn't the democratic platform be a pretty easy sell to most americans?the democratic platform is(if anyone bothered to articulate it clearly...)-   1-pro-education 2-pro-envrionment 3-pro-working families 4-pro strong and multilateral foreign policy 5-pro-economic growth(if you disagree with this i propose that you look at how the economy fared under 8 years of bill clinton...) 6-pro-health care 7-pro-diversity 8-pro-national security(the most effective national security leaders tend to be pragmatic democrats, or would you rather have paul wolfowitz and john ashcroft looking after the nations security?)   whereas the republicans tend to be:  1-pro-corporations 2-anti-environment(bush has cut billions from environmental protection)3-anti-education(bush has cut billions from education) 4-anti-health care 5-poor foreign policy(just look at the standing of the u.s overseas under bush as opposed to under clinton...)6-anti-diversity(or as bush puts it, his base is 'the have's, and the have more's..')  So why do so many americans think of themselves as republicans? And how do republicans support george bush, a draft dodging, inept politician who presided over the loss of 2 million jobs and created the largest federal deficit in the history of the u.s and lied to congress and the american people about reasons for starting a war that has resulted in thousands of unnecessary deaths?&nbsp;The democrats simply have the better platform, but the republicans win when it comes to lying and appealing to people's atavistic and base instinct.&nbsp;These are odd times.  &nbsp;

      Not much has been going on these past few days. I've done a few pedophile busts with Shelly and played guitar a little more than usual. Let's see.... ohhhhhhh... I almost forgot (how could I). I'm visiting&nbsp;Shelly in August/September down in Florida. Hmm.. nothing else has really happened as I haven't left the house since I got back from Josh's. He called me a few times begging me to come over.&nbsp;   Anyway, you can find a little bit about the pedophile busts at  urlLink http://fedorablackwidow.blogspot.com   Mood: satisfied... not really bored, but I'm getting there... as soon as I post this and do my usual internet stuff, check forums and blogs.. etc., I'll be bored.  TV: It's not on... but I fell asleep to that Bruce Willis movie "The Jackal", last night.  Sounds: Just finished listening to Neil Young's After The Goldrush album. Other than that, I hear my own typing and the air conditioning. I don't hear my computer fan as it has&nbsp;a silent one. Sometimes it's hard to tell if it's running if you don't look at the CPU.

      I've been sort of out of the house for the majority of the time since I got back. Josh went for about a month vacation a bit all over as I did for about 10 days in SC, GA, NC, and VA. I was wondering why he hadn't called... so I got a call from him one day and we've been going to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg... I spent the night at his house one night and I repainted his bedroom because of the half-assed job he did... so I had to touch everything up with a tiny artists brush meticulously because he didn't have the common knowledge to tape the walls around the trim. He didn't have the judgment to not go during heavy downpours of rain and he wanted my dad to drive us there, but he had to go to work, so I went home as it was kind of pissing me off. His dad took us today is it was only misting on and off. I also got to meet Josh's friend Hillary who was really nice. Josh seemed to be nice to her... at times... but there were also other times where he was an ass and was throwing water on us and it was freezing as hell (that makes no sense unless hell has frozen over... which means Shelly is now a stereotypical hippie... roflmao... anyway,&nbsp;Josh was being a bit of an ass at times, throwing water on both of us and we were freezing. My shirt is still drying... he also calls her a "bitch" behind her back and&nbsp;tries to take advantage of her and her mom to give him rides... and this is a direct quote "When is that bitch and her mom going to get here"... and not only that, but when I confronted him, he goes "Oh no, I don't talk like that to her if she's there"... the stuck up asshole. He is a *touch* ::rolls eyes:: spoiled... as well.   Hmm... what else was I going to say... I don't know. If I remember, I'll be back.  Mood - happy, tired...

      Yea, well, I'm home... yeppppp... what else can I say. I actually got home Tuesday night. I've just been busy since we got back because the day after I got back I had to go straight to work and help an old lady that I landscape for move stuff to her new house and trim some of the trees. Anyway, today I'm going to the guitar shop this morning so I won't get locked in like the last time I almost did because it was 45 minutes after they closed and I never even noticed the lights went out. lol. I might be mowing a larger place today (about 20-30 acres or so) but I'm not sure yet, if I don't do that, I'm going back over to that lady's house and I'm going to put up her blinds for her. It's about 8:00 am... I've just got to... wait around till my dad wakes up. Imagine how much time I'm wasting... what if I could get all of that time back before I die... The property of time conservation... tsk tsk... hmm. Yeah... well, I'll post this then I'm going to check the forums at Harmony-Central. com and hipforums...   TV - A show on the history channel about Galileo  Music - Last night I listened to REO Speedwagon, Crosby Stills and Nash, and Neil Young... oh, and Mississippi John Hurt.

      Ok... I had another weird dream but this made no damn sense. Ok... I dreampt that I was in Boston again... except this time carrot top didn't shoot shelly. Anyway... it happened like this. There were public showers there where homeless people could get cleaned up. I dreampt that I was going to take a shower there for some reason... but... I don't know how this happened. I took of my pants and for some reason I walked out of the public shower place and onto the sidewalk by the street and walked. Everybody started running away and I was like "why are you running away?!?!?" and I had no pants on and I kept walking around the city like that until this cop chases me so I run around the city trying to throw her off... then I take my shirt off and run into this restaurant and the whole time the cop is trying to find me. I take a shower and find this shirt in there and put it on (::thinks:: hopefully she won't recognize me) and when I open the door, she's in a cop's uniforn still but she goes "UPS" and she's holding a UPS package and i'm thinking "wtf"... anyway, she's like.... "I know you" and she throws down the package and she licks my cheek (for some odd reason) then she grabs my hand and handcuffs it and takes me to jail. Ok.. what in the hell was that all about.  ~ George... going home today.  TV: off Music: John Hurt's Big Leg Blues (what I listened to last) Mood: I dunno... normal-ish(?)

      I used to walk around with my eyes on fire My nerves real close to my skin Had a fist full of questions and a brand on my cheek And we would skate where the ice got thin  And the smoke blowin' down from a cabin on a hilltop Smoke blowin' down in the street Some kind of sweet smellin' mystical backdrop To the story unfolding at my feet  There's an edge to the twist of an acrobat in the air There's an edge to the twist of a knife There's a hard heart of darkness hovering there Just around the corner from life  And I, I have no answers I got no patented path to set you free Besides I wouldn't know where you wanted to go And it's probably not the same place as me  There's a thousand roads up this mountain You can get lost in a minute if you try And it's probably enough that I was just laughing today, yeah Lookin' this close in your eye  I said there was a thousand roads up this mountain You can get lost in a minute if you try It's probably enough that I was just laughing today, yeah Looking this close in your eye, in your eye In your eye...  ~ George  TV - Men In Black, TBS Music - None... last listened to Neil Young on the way back to Savannah.

      Here I am in the lovely Atlanta, Georgia... well, technically, I am in Conyers, Georgia... Outskirts of Atlanta. Anywho, today my parents visited Doug... my dad went to high school with him. Erm.... yeah. Doug is redneckish... well, not in the way he acts. It's sorta like me.... he's an anti-bush democrat with the most southern accent you would ever hear.  My mom and I went with Doug's wife Stephanie and her daughter Amber to the water park in Atlanta.... wait.. crap... is it in Atlanta or Marietta... anyway, it was Six Flags Whitewater Park... it was fairly ok... I mostly sat in the sun with a couple towels :P and went on a few rides. I fell asleep... let's see... oh... Stephanie knows this lifeguard dude there who is a gay stripper... we met him. Then we met her boss at the park... Anyway... Stephanie and Amber went to eat at her parents and Doug is here with my parents and i'm on their computer. I don't know wether i'm spending the night here or if we're going all the way back to Savannah tonight... brrr... cold cold cold. I kept thinking about the dream I had where Shelly was shot by that Carrot Top... ya... just dial down the center... 1-800-CALL-ATT. I hope Shelly is okay... damn, that dream was rather strange :P... picture Carrot Top with a gun trying to shoot someone... he was wearing a hoodie and these patchy hippy looking patchy jeans with red socks and black tennis shoes... he was sort of... frowning... and jogging... carrying a .38 special revolver... then he shot shelly... and ran... that evil little wanker. I'll get you Carrot Top!!!

      I have to type this as fast as I possibly can. I am in the library right now in Charleston, South Carolina... and it is closing soon and we have to be back in Savannah, Georgia tonight...and this is going to be rather long. Ok... commence the starting of the typances. (I wrote this last night)  Sitting on the 12th floor oceanfront balcony of room 1246 in the Dayton House Resort's suites highrise building, there aren't many places I would rather be than looking over the skyline. To the left, the Atlantic ocean, to the right, the hustle and bustle of the city. Yes, a single story beach house with a private beach on Hatteras Island is nice, but I enjoy change every once in a while... not to mention our beach house being sold after Hurricane Isabel's damage last year. But, you can see everything from up here!!! If I want, I could go up to the 13th floor roof and hang my feet over the top. This is the last night here in Myrtle Beach on our venture south down the lower East Coast and i'm sad to say we're probably not going to make it to Tallahassee or Jacksonville or to the Florida border at all as there is so much to do along the way down. But, we are probably making coming within 30 miles and it's been a lovely cruise so far. Like the license plate says, smiling faces, beautiful places (my chicken scratch writing makes it look almost like it says feces... but the wind is blowing pretty hard up here). South Carolina, Georgia, (and if we made it to Florida, i'm sure it would as well except for the mass quantities of senior citizens) beats Virginia by a wide margin. To tell you the truth (why would I lie about it), the old dominion seems more rednecked than S.C. and the people down here are a lot nices and can't compare to the average Virginian you come across.   Holy crap... there's three or four people parasailing within a few feet of each other and one of those banner planes almost hit them. I didn't mention the night life down here. There's of course, places like Ripley's which looks somewhat out of place as it's built to resemble a closed down factory. Laws are different from Hatteras Island, as I have come to find. Aah, here are the ladies with their produce truck again. They come by the highrises every day and cruise down the street selling their own tomatoes, potatoes, peaches, melons, and cantaloupes. I'm pretty much writhing this right now because I want to get out of the way of housekeeping.   Ok, I just took a couple hours of intermission (of writing this yesterday) and my parents have gone shopping and I'm out on the balcony listening to the radio and writing this again. This vacation has been fun overall so far, but a little creepy and shockeing at the same time.First of all, I was going to go parasailing in Savannah (today) but we bought fireworks (two days ago) and decided to shoot them off the beach instrad. We (my dad and I) went along the beach shooting firecrackers and a cop showed up following us in a truck. He yelled at me and said "You wanna stop running so I don't have to chase you" and he got out and said to my dad "Fireworks are illegal, did you know that?" and my dad said "No sir" and the cop accused us of hiding something and he had his mace out then he screamed at us "Would you like to go to jail or pay the $300 fine?" (we found out later it was really $200). The whole time he had his handcuffs out and he was pointing his mace at us and he had his gun holster unbuttoned and we were explaining (as he asked us to) then when he got a call on his radio he told us to "Shut the fuck up" and then he said something into the receiver for the radio and he got into the truch and as he drove off, said "Consider this your second chance." The whole time I was thinking "Holy shit... it's robocop"... over fireworks... lmfao.  After that, we went back to our hotel. The funny thing was that the people up in the highrises behind us were cheering and yelling "more fireworks" when we were shooting them and when the cop came they were booing and the cop got all pissed off. We went to Georgetown and stopped at Hampton Plantation and it gave us really bad vibes, especially around the slave's quarters. I mean, it was just really creepy and we wanted to get out of there. After that, we walked by Charleston harbor and took a walk around the historic Charlestown area and around the battery and the park. Afterwards, we went to a bigger plantation (Boone Hall Plantation) where a woman was crying and she walked up to me and hugged me and said that her husband inherited some money and said that he punches her and that he was about to drive off without her and she said she was scared.  You know, that is the worst feeling you can ever get. She told me that she had been married for 39 years. It just scares me knowing that it goes on and I can't do anything about it. It's the worst feeling you could ever get. Because she is so helpless herself. I walked around the plantation and the whole time she was leaning over a fence crying and nobody could help her. I can't really be sexist or discriminate being male myself. But some people just never learn. I mean, what could I have done. I've seen it all before when I used to to volunteer work at the laurel shelter. But... to have someone come up to you and say that really impacts you so much and even if you've thought that you've seen it all... Her lip was bleeding too. I still feel like i've done something wrong by not doing much... but I hope I helped make a difference by hugging her and talking to her.    - Ok... that's the end of that writing. We're spending the night here in Savannah at a bed and breakfast and I photographed a few plantations this morning here in Charleston. A few of the plantations (as I said) gave off feelings like you weren't supposed to be there.... and it really felt like that at a few of the cemetaries and graveyards we visited. We're driving to Atlanta the day after tomorrow and we're going on a few more historical tours. I'm going to visit the famous Maple Street Music and Guitar Shop in Atlanta. We're going to visit my dad's friend, Doug, in Conyers, Georgia, outside of Atlanta, and we're driving around the area a bit.   On the way back to Myrtle Beach from Georgetown yesterday, we saw an old black man get hit by the car in front of us. After he was hit, the car slanned on their breaks and we swerved off of the road and almost hit a palm tree and they caused about a 5 car pile up. We swerved just in time... :P... That was another sad time as well. Anywho, it's 7:00 ish and that's been my vacation so far, i'm going to go find my parents (they went shopping) and we're going to eat dinner and head to Savannah. Good bye and I may stop in for another update. By the way, that stomach flu and bronchitus is gone... I still have a little congestion, but i'm doing well.  Oh, I almost forgot a dream that I had... I had two dreams but I don't remember the other one. Ok, dream time...  I was somewhere... in a city or something. Anywho, (I haven't said this but Shelly is in Boston right now on vacation) I had a weird dream that she got shot...  Goodbye...  ~ George

      I thought I updated this before. Oh well. I saw fahrenheit 9/11 (Did I say that before? I don't know... anyway). I got bronchitus from my parents... And... that has been pretty much it. All i've been doing since my last post is sleeping and trying to get better before vacation comes... Once in a while I get up and check my posts on hipforums or look at ebay or something like that, but other than that, I feel like shit. This is probably the last post before I go on vacation because we're leaving early tomorrow morning... See you June 10th I guess..... 9th, 10th, 11th... I don't know when i'll be back. Maybe if I get to a library, i'll post an update or something.... but i'll probably just be moping around the hotel trying to get better.... ugh. Why on vacation.  ~ George  Music: Jimi Hendrix (I don't even know what the song is, but I know it's Jimi Hendrix... I think it's called Angel) TV: The last thing I watched was some soap opera on NBC (You know how it is when you feel so crappy you don't feel like changing the channel) Mood: How do you think I feel.

      I usually post more often, but I haven't really been motivated to do so - lol. Anywho... I called liveprayer again since the last time and said I had a friend addicted to porn... and nothing much happened really. Well, I am going on vacation starting June 4th, 5th, or 6th. We're planning on going to Myrtle beach for about three days then Savannah, Georgia for about two or three. We were going to go to florida. My dad wanted to go just travel around and stop at Orlando or Tampa and go down to the lower part of the state to the keys. But... we might do that in August... but our plans are being screwed up by my grandmother who keeps moving from NC to here and is trying to get situated up here. Plus we need to fix our bathroom upstairs and do some renovating..... sooooooooo.... anywho... I may be going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today at the Regal Kiln Creek 20 theatre in Newport News. I bought a new easel on ebay since my old one broke about 6 months ago. It's actually a vintage easel - new for me. I still need to get some canvasses and hopefully some Windsor and Newton paints (ugh... i'm spending too much money)... I think I still have some old brushes. I got 6th row tickets to Crosby, Stills, and Nash tickets for August 18th.... yay... I feel a bit more happy today than yesterday.... I went to bed earlier too. So... my top things on my list - fahrenheit 9/11 - vacation in south carolina - vacation in georgia - maybe florida in august - crosby, stills, and nash concert in august - dave matthews band concert in august.  yay yay yay.... I feel so fucking happy right now I could do a happy dance. happy happy happy. wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I love everything. I love everyone. HAPPY. HAPPY. HAPPY.  Yes... i'm either on drugs (i'm not) or I need them (who knows, who cares)... I'm happy.... yep, i'm sure it will go away later, but i'll sing for the moment. Earlier I listened to Crosby, Stills, Nash and some Neil Young and played my Gibson and the Martin for a bit.  Music - listening to shelly's music over voice chat (DJ Shadow) TV - It's not on, but the last thing I actually watched was The tonight show with Jay Leno and then this morning it was on and Mad TV was on and part of the Wimbledon men's finals were on... but I don't watch sports... I wasn't even watching mad TV... so I say the last thing I saw was The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (I almost typed Jay Wimbledon) Mood - HAPPY :)

      Civillian deaths alone in Iraq: 11,510 - 13, 483 people. Number of WMD Found: Zero. American Lives Saved From "Iraq Threat": Zero. Please bring our troops home. We have lost many more American lives by attacking and occupying Iraq rather than if we would have dealt with the Iraq "threat" diplomatically. Not to mention all the people dead who had nothing to do with this crap at all. Bring the troops home. I do not want to see any more lives lost in this senseless war.  Shelly has gone to seek shelter from Hurricane Charley... It's making landfall down there anytime now. I'm listening to internet radio and it's making landfall around Port Charlotte/Sarasota/Fort Meyers... supposedly. Doesn't mean they're off the hook. Pressure is dropping... 125 mph. Certainly not the worst I've ever seen. I think people are overreacting... I've seen them all before time and time again. I do have to say, better safe than sorry. I think it will go a little further south than the tampa area... I was originally thinking Naples, but it moved, so a touch north. Yes, it will be bad, but only in a range of a few miles around the eyewall. Pure luck... on Friday the thirteenth, at that.

      I've been fairly busy today. I was supposed to mow fields for someone but they weren't home... so we tried to get our tractor started but flooded it so we moved on... 1960 Ford 601 Workmaster... Was my great-grandfather's tractor... Anyway, we moved on and went to my grandmother's house. I mowed and trimmed her yard, moved and stored some boxes... and then I had a little incident with my dad while up in the attic storing some extra stuff in boxes that my grandmother didn't need. So, he walks up in front of me and I said "Just go on the rafters"... then he goes "Oh, I see plywood over there" so he walks over and "CRASH"... he falls through the ceiling and falls onto a coffee table and tries to hang onto cords that I was grabbing onto up there... I was holding onto a beam and didn't fall. We now have a gigantic hole through the ceiling of my grandmother's family room... I also was going to put a bookshelf together and get it all situated for her... Then I find part of the shelf cracked... so we have to take it back to Haverty's. Then, we come home and my mom's gigantic gas guzzling lincoln navigator is blocking the driveway... so I rad to run in, get the key, and move that on the street while my dad pulled the truck into the front yard, waited, then parked the truck. Then, when we got inside, my mom goes "The mower won't start"... and we find that she put in Gas and Oil mixture instead of regular gas... it ran but it sputtered the whole time. Anyway... not a very good day as far as that goes. I managed to bruise my hip and hurt my ankle when I was grabbing onto that beam when my dad fell through the ceiling.  Oh, by the way, found out today my uncle died of an enlarged heart... Shelly's webcam is on but she seems to have fallen asleep... what to do, what to do... oh well... I suppose I'll sit here and wait until I get really tired ::yawn::... anyway... I suppose I'll go put the salsa back in the fridge, watch TV, maybe check ebay out, and go to sleep in a bit. I'm feeling a bit chilly. I'm going to go and check my dad's weather station thing or w/e. bye....

      I really want to see that movie, The Notebook, again. That was such a good movie. I loved it. Ok... think of it this way... you've got the titanic. Syrupy stupid stuff combined with a doomed ship on it's path to death. Take away the ship, take away the syrupy stuff, and you have the best romance ever made. James Garner... I've loved pretty much every movie he's ever been in. He reminds me of Jack Nicholson now with less of a flemsy charachter. Great actor.  ~ George

      Hahaha... I just had the strangest thought. What if you were to call it Fop or Foop instead of F.O.P? Anywho, this guy representing the fop (I'll just call it that because it makes them sound ignorant) called saying "Good day to you sir... are you the man of the house? BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH would you like to donate $45, $35 or play it safe and pay $25"...  Anyway, he called three times and my dad was asleep but picked up the phone the first time and hung up when he said he was from the F.O.P, then the 2nd time I picked up and when he said he was from the fraternal order of police I went "bye" and slammed the phone down. He then called again... the third time. I was writing when the wanker called and anyway felt like speaking my mind so I said "I'll tell you what, I'm 14 and, of course, am not the man of the house, but I would like to speak my mind because I can't vote on state,  federal, or local issues, and you know that. Quit bothering the hell out of people who have lives, I'm sorry you don't have enough funding for the benifits of officers, but tough... everyone else is having a hard time too, maybe you should do something about it by talking to Jo Ann Davis, the first district congresswoman, or Harvey Morgan, your state delegate, or your senators" He goes "Well, have a nice day sir." ::slam::  Ok, just for the record, a different guy from the fop called twice while I was writing this post making that a total of five times.  I would just like to say in my nearly 15 years of life, I have never once been saved by the police. Never.  We've had things stolen, they did absolutely nothing about it. And the time we were down in Myrtle Beach shooting fireworks (we didn't know it was illegal since we saw fireworks being shot all up and down the beach) the guy had pepper spray in one hand and half a doughnut in the other and threatens to chase us. The most they've ever done is harass me. If I'm ever murdered and gone, once you're gone, you don't come back. Justice is a nice thing but I think prosecutors do more of a job than the police do in that case.  ~ George

      So I just got home about five minutes ago. I walked to the theater down the street from my house. And... I have to say, that is the best movie I've seen all year. I loved that movie. I got there a few minutes into it (5 minutes) but the story didn't get good till I had seated. I used one of the gift certificates that I had received from school for getting a six hundred on my SOL (joy...), anywho, I felt really connected to the movie. Mostly because I've seen it happen before. It's so sad... My mom is a nurse and I've volunteered at the nursing home and rehabilitation center she works it. It really takes a certain kind of person to do such a job... working with the elderly. Boy, do I have stories to tell about that place. You probably don't know what I'm talking about if you haven't seen the movie. It just made me so damn sad yet happy at the same time. It's well worth it to go see it. I mean... this movie was just so beautiful... it's sad, but it's beautiful. It's sad because I've had people in their 80s tell me their stories about things like that movie. Things that happened back then. I've seen them come and go. I've seen them pass on. A lot of nurses never seem to care...   Oh, and Shelly just refreshed my memory on accident. This movie majorly took place in Charleston, South Carolina. I recognized a lot of the area and recognized  urlLink http://www.boonehallplantation.com  That's a plantation I visited on my stay down there. Beautiful place. The sad thing in my mind were the slave cabins... 7 or 8 remaining brick slave cabins, if I recall. They're the only things left standing that are original. I saw that and those great big willow trees lining the drive to the front gate. I felt like I needed to shout "That's Boone Hall"!!! The house was rebuilt in 1935 as a colonial revival plantation... anywho, enough of history. I get too deep into details.  Now, I'm going to remember all of the people passed through my life... people who died of ages between 86 and 104... if I recall.  Mrs. Kemp + Mr. Kemp (how I loved this couple... I loved them so much.. his wife passed shortly him though... )  Mrs. Carter (I always remember you.. alzheimers had taken you, but I still did my best to converse when I could)  Mrs. Allaun (I remember sitting in your room and watching TV... I remember you falling asleep the night you had died... I remember your chair... that was my last memory... sitting in your recliner the night you died and my mom discovered and called me in the morning around 7 after my dad picked me up)  Mrs. Nicholas (I know you couldn't speak well... but I remember your stories about when you were a doctor and about your husband)  Mrs. Fletcher (Those last days were bad memories... you were the first resident I really got to know... I must have been six or seven then...)  Mrs. Brown (I remember you telling me about where you lived... not more than a half a mile from where I lived... I remember looking for your glasses... even though you were blind.)  These are a few people who I still remember today. A few people who left a memory in my life. They are a few people who I will never forget... I did all I could. Hoped I could make a difference. Rest in peace.   ~ George Snow

      I've been thinking about seeing that movie that movie The Notebook... it's from a book that was written by Nicholas Sparks... He wrote a book about a love story that took place where I used to hang out down in Cape Hatteras, Rodanthe (chicamacomaco), entitled  Nights in Rodanthe , if I recall correctly. He also wrote the book Message In A Bottle, which had a movie made after it. Anywho, it seems as if it's the only thing worth watching since the only other two things playing are The Princess Diaries 2 and Spiderman 2... what is it with all these superhero movies... Haven't they gone a bit overkill on those already. We need more sci-fi, suspense, comedy, and romance. The last thing I want to see is Tobey Maguire in a suit chasing green goblins because he was bitten by a spider, trying to save the love of his life. Anywho.. I feel like seeing the notebook but it's playing at 3:30, 6:00, 8:30... I'd like to take a walk or something. I don't like this town's atmosphere sometimes. It's too innocent looking...  ~ George

      NYTimes As he signed a $417 billion Pentagon spending bill, the president offered his own unique take on how the money would be used. "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Mr. Bush said. "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people - and neither do we."

         I read up on my religions a bit today since I didn't have much on mylist of things to do... I never have anything to do... probably shows in my guitar playing. Anywho, I read up on the bible, a few buddhist teachings, and I read up on judaism to refresh some of the known history of the supposed gods in existance. Though I do admit, Buddha... Siddhartha, whichever you wish to call the great teacher, was not a god as he spoke himself. As I read some things on Christianity I was struck with how stupid and weak the people that the Christian God chose for His work were. The Christian God said I'll do this for you or use you to do my work and they praised God for his power and greatness, a while later they are lying and cheating each other, scemeing, killing, drunk, complaining, worshiping gold cows...the list goes on and on.     They did have their moments of following Gods direction and some never faltered. I guess my point is that we are that way too. Contentment is something that America makes close to impossible. Today I realized that I am a bit more content than I ever have been. Nothing that I could buy could make me happier... well, a new guitar is always a plus in my life... Family, friends, places to use the talents I have, a nice place to live in a call home, my parents (I'll admit they're not the greatest thing since sliced bread, but they're my parents, I love them, even though they can be a bit pestering with their foolish money spending and meaningless debates and arguments), plus I have enough money to support my one and only hobby (GUITARS, GUITARS, AND MORE GUITARS...well, then comes organ/piano/keyboard and I never play keyboarded instruments much)...it's all beyond what I deserve. The promised land for the Isrealites... They complained for forty years before they finally got a place to hang their hats.     The human will always look out for his/her self until failing miserably and turning to someone else. How's the saying go? If at first you don't succeed, try try again. It seems to work with certain things; if you can't throw darts to save your life and you want to be better than practice and you'll get it eventually. The bigger picture, life, doesn't seem to mimick that. The harder we try on our own to be content, the more we fail miserably.  Once you're gone... I suppose there are no worries on politics, religion, money, life, death. It's a different concept... supposedly, but scientifically there is no evidence of knowing.  Some would think that I don't care about all those things, and truthfully, I really don't care if John Doe is Mormon or Jewish or worshipping a statue in is garage. As long as the man who becomes president can do the job and do it right while taking steps forward instead of tripping and falling backwards down a starecase, failing miserably, and turning to someone else (a new president...) for help to fix errors. If I had to eat ramen everyday for the next year I know would make it... I just don't want a greedy foolish president trying to front the entire corporate world... Anybody who is a republican or a conservative can understand me here can't you? Can't we comprimise? Four to Eight  years of a brighter future for your children... eight years of a brighter future for yourself... you got your wish... you got a republican... can't you just please give us a chance? Please... don't you know people are dying out there in Iraq. Every day. So you and your children's children are able to live. And they didn't want to go to Iraq. I, by no means, like the military's unnecessary use of force, but I, by no means, don't want anyone to die if they feel they are not ready to die... You're sending people with families to die in Iraq... and how do you feel about that? They don't want to do... deep down, I know they don't want to go. Just please... do us a favor and help us end it. Together we can do this. We're all in the same boat here aren't we? All we are saying is give peace a chance... come on... you got your war, if you aren't foolish, please don't make it any longer. OK? That's all I'm asking... just for one time consider to be a little more compassionate.  I'm a middle-of-the-road type of person as far as politics go... I try to consider all possible moves and options that are available to my advantage. In my case... I can't vote. And I know why too... there's no way I'm letting some of these idiots my age vote. I just wish politics weren't such a controversial issue... I wish schools were a bit more accepting and had open arms to people who wished to exercise your rights and freedom of speech to speak your mind on political issues. Your child could finally learn something... Most baby boomers grew up throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s and got to see some of the most important times in American history. Your child may never see anything of the sort, you know. We are seeing a bit of something now and this is going down in the books. But since... I guess, no, no, I couldn't. The French and Indian war... for some reason my mind tells be 1751... or 1763.. I know I'm a few years off... I'll look it up on google when I get a chance, anywho, since we've been known as a country, we've had war. This country was established apon war.  You may disagree with me here, but I say that this country was really founded apon religious tensions with the Church Of England, in 1621 if I recall, when the pilgrims crossed the Atlantic in the Mayflower.  Of course, beforehand there was Sir... aah.. I just had his name in mind... I can't remember... blanked out... AAH!!! ::lightbulb cuts on:: Sir Walter Raleigh... anyway, 1500s, founded the roanoke island colony on Roanoke island, the town is now known better today as Manteo, North Carolina and is a part of the outer banks and Cape Hatteras island chain. I spent about a weekend in Hatteras every month and one to two weeks a summer there up until last year when Hurricane Isabel washed everything away... I knew a lot of good people down there from my age and some up into their 60s and 70s... Rob, Russell, C.E., Nick, Bob... I don't know how they all faired... I haven't been down there since July of 2003... I sure miss those times. I considered Rodanthe, North Carolina and Cape Hatteras to be my true home. Much more than Gloucester, Virginia.  Anywho, getting back on topic... Sir Walter Raleigh was in charge of the colony down on Roanoke Island... highway 158 runs right to it off of I-95 and takes you right to it, if I recall. Of course nobody knows just what happened to Raleigh's colony that mysteriously vanished... I need to move along here since I'm in a hurry.. anywho, there was the whole Croatoan/Croatan and Virginia Dare issue and they thought that Natives killed everyone and destroyed everything and nobody knows what exactly happened on Roanoke Island to this day...  Ok, moving on... Jamestown Island is about 30-40 minutes from here in Gloucester.  That was founded in 1607 ....  This is getting way too long. Plus the news is on channel 10 and I've got to send someone something... I'll get back to this some other time.  Take care,                       George Snow  Music : Crosby, Stills, Nash, And Young TV: Channel 10 local news Mood: busy, happy...

      Last night John Kerry passed through Winslow, Arizona. The plan was to slow down the train so he could wave to supporters who had gathered near the tracks. On the way into town he saw a group of people carrying two bed sheets which read, “You give us 10 minutes, we’ll give you eight years.” He asked the engineer to stop the train and then gave an impromptu fifteen minute speech to the delight of the assembled crowd.  Starting to love this man more and more every day...   Not a whole lot has been going on lately.. soooooo... alas, not much posting.  ~ George

      I also heard that local Cuban theaters are showing it (from bootleg DVDs), and the lines are several blocks long to get in. Most Cubans said they were amazed that the U.S. government would allow someone to make and show a film like Fahrenheit 911 to the public, and live to see it. The Bush administration and a lot of other scumbag Republicans used every dirty trick in the book to stop it from being shown, a lot of theatre owners have been threatened and are too frightened to show it. Typical lowlife Republicans only believe in free speech when it comes to political donations.   urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/040730/325/ez7g0.html   I went to work yesterday. It was a big mess afterwards...lol. And during a hurricane as well....never landscape during a hurricane. Tsk, tsk, tsk, have I any judment at all? I really wonder sometimes. I really don't need the money anyway but I like to work. Afterwards, I went to my grandmother's house. Did random things as she is still moving things in and arranging. We've ran down to North Carolina already four times since April... moving it load by load. I think we got the last load of furniture last weekend. It's painful being stuck in the cab of a uhaul for 5 hours. And it doesn't help being in a traffic jam and seeing an overturned and totaled uhaul with an entire dual wheel laying in the median either. Anywho, I rearranged furniture, painted, put up shelves, hooked up her computer, tv, stereos.... etc. Random little things like that. I had to program her telephones. I don't see a point in having four or five telephones as three of them are portable anyway. But... whatever she wants.  I stopped at Winter Sound and got a new guitar as well. I bought a new... (well, it was a 2003, but it was still brand new and unsold) 2003 Fender Standard Series Stratocaster. I kind of miss my old Fender '57 Reissue strat, so I played a few new guitars they had in stock and finally found a metallic jade green colored strat. The guitar changes colors in certain light. Sometimes it looks metallic silver or pewter, but it's really a metallic jade color. Alder body... maple neck and fretboard... etc. etc. Sounds more bright and crispier than my old one... my old one was more Stevie Ray Vaughan-esque sounding... as in his guitar "Number one"... I'd say this one is more like his other guitar Lenny. I like the tremolo on it... I've dive-bombed it and tried my best but I just can't get the thing to go out of tune. Beats me. Maybe I should stray away from 50s and 60s vintage strats in the future and just buy cheap old mexican Fenders. (Oh, good geal on it, $319.00... with tax it was $337.xx)... if I ordered it from  urlLink http://www.musiciansfriend.com , it would have been $349.00... though I could probably get any color I want (the color doesn't really matter) and they'd throw in free shipping... but I like the color. If I was to buy one off of musician's friend, It would probably be in Tabbaco sunburst, brown sunburst, two tone, or three tone if I didn't get the metallic jade color. Yes, I'm a big sunburst finish fan. I wish they would go back to nitrocellulose finishes... these sure won't age like the ones from the 1950s. It would take a nuclear bomb for it to age and get the sound to change. Oh well... good deal anyways. I'm not sure if I like it better than my Gibson Les Paul.... way different animal though. I don't get my 1960 reissue les paul... the ceramic humbuckers (at least the neck) are always giving feedback and doing all this weird shit. The only reason I became such a Neil Young fan is because someone told me (I can't remember who) that when I played that thing it sounded like Neil Young's 1953 Les Paul, Old Black. So, I bought Rust Never Sleeps and Harvest.. lo and behold... OMG... is that my les paul? Since then, I have bought a dozen or so Neil Young albums and I also managed to stumble across a vintage Martin of David Crosby's on ebay and bought it. I'm going to see Crosby, Stills, and Nash August 13th.... anywho, enough of that. My amplifier is still on... I've been playing on and off since I woke up this morning around 8:00. I fell asleep last night while Shelly was busting a pedophile... :p... eh... ta ta for now.  Mood: cold isn't a mood... but it's 91 degrees outside, I cut the A/C off and i'm still freezing.  TV: It's off... but I am going to turn it on as soon as I'm done with this post.  Music:... The last thing I listened to was Neil Young's unplugged album in the shower this morning.  ~ George
