I chatted wif him last nite and we were arguing abt some stuffs. hahha, juz teasing each other arnd... u may find it weird though, but its us! frm day one we knew each other, its tis way. its was only till dunno when, we stopped behaving like tat. mayb bcos we've grown up or sumting, hmmmm meaning we'r back to childish nw?!?! *winkz  let them say! i dun care! so long i'm happy and he's happy, i wun giv it a damn. opps! i shouldn't say such words... sorry!   juz a few hrs ago, chat wif him for a little while, he's busy wif sum stuffs... i went on to hav dinner, slept awhile, watch tv and aft bath, went back to comp... he actually msg me to tell me he's going off to sleep and nite!! hmmm weird him.... but i'm happy...

      I had a dream last nite... I dreamt i was gonna marry a prince! Everybody's very happy for the occasion and my frens were helping me to dress up when my shoes went missing. Aft much search, i rem tat i place in under my chair.... then my phone rang, time to wake up for work. Wat a day to start! Sunday, and i'm on duty... U tink i saw my prince charming??? No i din. I tink heaven's telling me that i can only dream to marry a prince. or worse, i can only dream if i wanna marry someone i like....  Life's so complicated! he wrote in his blog that it might be his retribution tat the 2 women he loved most step outta his life, cos he've hurt some gals in the past. i was tinking tat he deserve it, but awhile later, i felt real sad. I plead with heaven, if its bcos tat he hurt me tat he got his retribution, i'll rather not. Pls let him be happy. treat it as i'm never hurt, pls let him hav happiness. i'll be happy.... i will.....

      I'm feeling much better. went sakae sushi with some frens aft work last nite. brings back memory man... my 1st time to sakae was with him. I like being with him. doing anything with him. I always felt anxious when going to meet him but when i'm with him, everything's else doesn't matter. the feeling of being with him, walking with him, eating with him, strolling with him.... i can't describe the feelings, its so incredible. i dunno how he feels when he's with me. probably nothing at all!   yesterday's nite dinner really brings back memories to me. i dun seems to be upset anymore. like wat i've said "it doesn't matter tat if i'll be together with him or not, it would be thw whole's most happiest thing if it is. But, wat i hav is the unforgettable memories he gav me, sweet ones.... it doesn't matter if we'll last forever, will only keep the present & the past."  i love taking walks nw. use to take short cuts going home, nw i wld take my time. cos when i'm alone, i wld tink of him. i hope he's happy nw, he's gonna start his last semester in au. will be coming back soon.... he's gonna eat all the goodies tat he miss here! will he ask me along? i doubt so... well, not even once??? ......   Seasons will flow but nothing changes my love How rich my life has been Its all bcos of you You're the meaning of my entire life The shelter & the comfort the moments & all the memories  Feelings have shown but why don't you acknowledge  For our life we have missed due to misunderstandings You're the sunshine & all the warmth that i need The destiny & purpose most of all that i know well, I love you

      I tink i'm not very well these days... Juz came back frm au few days ago, down with a bad flu, work dread & a heart break. Dunno how to discribe my feelings but i hav tis feel for someone. I din dare to say for fear i'll lose the frenship. wat am i to say tat i love him? i'm juz a nobody... i want him to be happy, he's perfect to me, so he deserve to be with someone better, much much better.  kinna hav a small misunderstanding recently, feel so bad tat i've made him upset. but he seems to forget abt tat matter. well, as i've said, i'm nothing to him... juz a fren...   i hate myself, hate myself for not saying out. does he knows? only he himself knows... i din dare and i'm afraid. wat a coward...   i wish the best for him, pls let him hav the best things in life and everlasting happiness. pains my heart to see him upset. i tink he's happy, at least till he's back... he will be happy....   Wondering how are you now  If i know things gonna turn out this way  I wouldn't have made you mine  I wanan have you as a friend  A friend forever,  Now, you drifted far..  So far away..  I couldn't see, i couldn't feel  Never had i told you 'I Love You'  Cause i always thought you knew  And though you're with someone new  There's something i need to say to you  I really love you...   He wrote tis in his blog, but i feel its more suitable for me.... who is he feeling it for? how lucky is tat someone...

      today went for KTV session. tats aft a long long time, n i strongly believe my vocals have change... hmm tink gotta get them back! shit job i have, need to tok most of the time, tink tats where all my vocals went man! better change job real soon!  didn't go online yesterday, then sae his blog juz nw. he's sad. he asked a qns abt if anyone would befriend your ex-bf/gf. tink he's quite sad abt his ex. well, i'm of no position to tell him my ans. but i tink there's frenship betwn the both parties. I'm a good example! I'm still frens with my 2 ex-bfs. Well, alot of things takes 2 hands to clap. To me, its juz tat we couldn't click, n we leave each other for the other good. So y not? Y hate? unless one party's at fault or watever. haiz who cares anyway?  For my theory is, watever u do, juz don't hurt anyone. Be nice, and I believe ppl will be nice to u too! sumtimes things might turn out the other way, but still I feel my consience's clear mah.  Though i feel sad for him, but the feeling is not so strong. Probably i'm trying very hard, but it might be tat my feel for him is not so much anymore??? I still dunno, but i know i'm trying my very best. I wanna a future. I need one. I gotta let go I know. And I'm trying real hard......  When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look ahead, you can look beside you  and your best friend will be there.

      I saw True Love today the love of 2 lovelorn people miles miles apart  Though they were far apart but their hearts were never seperated  Their love touch my heart the love they had for each other is so strong and self-less that tears flow down my cheeks  I see happiness in them I feel the love they shared Thru the days they motivate & encourage each other to walk thru the burdens of life  The encouragement she gave him the promise he gave her to ask who on earth can love each other so deeply  Though can't see each other she took a pic of herself with encouraging pharse for him post it in her blog for him to see  He in return wrote a poem for her to express his happiness & tell her how much he love her wrote yet another poem...                I may not be your best,             but I will give you my best.                 Please wait, baby.                I will be home soon.   He's miles away from home away from her but never are their hearts away from each other  Thats wat I've found in them How much I envy them For I'm not as fortunate to have someone like that   Never Doubt Eternal Trust Forever Give Infinity Love

He's like there, with me.... I wonder did he hav the same dream. Probably not, well, its juz a dream.     You'r too much into me I felt like I'm living in your shadows Juz like wat you've told me  I've put you aside thrown you to the back of my mind and get rite out of ur life  I've tried so hard and come tis far but still, u r here in my mind  Call it heaven's fate or human's will I still gonna care, cos I'll feel  I've come to this stage where time really goes with age when things do have to change  I might meet someone new and I wanna to make it true to start a whole new me  who doesn't lives in you    PS: To you my love, though you will never see... but if fate do prove us true. Oneday, you will know my love for you...

      I had a dream of you & me I was waiting for u at a crowded market there were lots of things but I didn't look at them I was waiting for you  At last, I saw you at the other end You waved to me You shoved thru the crowd towards me and u finally reach me  You asked me if I've waited long I answered no You held on my hand gently and led me thru the crowd  to a cafe by the seaside  The cafe was romantic with candles lit and soft sea breeze outside was crowded too and you led me to the other end where there were lesser ppl  We sat down at a table near to the sea had a view of sunset and the calming sea with you still holding on to my hands The ppl were watching us with envy might be tinking how compatible the couple is  You were smoothing my hands and I felt the romance when I woke up from my sleep again and tout it will never end  How I wish all is true How I wish tat it will be you I tout I've felt you and the feeling is so true  If I have the choice I'll choose not to wake cos in dreams I can live with you and I wanna so much to say I Love You ......
