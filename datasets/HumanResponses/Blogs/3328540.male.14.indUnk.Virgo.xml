      Well, last nite was the inevitable succes that was "Ramen Party Nite" as I have now decided to name it. It was craaaaazy. Multiple people, who for their sakes will remain un-named ended up dressing as members of the opposite sex, and the scary thing was that they actually looked sort of hot which really freaks me out when I think about it. We finally got lil Jon to eat his first packet of Ramen, but unfortunately his GF couldn't come, so he had to put up with being groped my various men. I finally got to give lil Miss Linda her gifts from the Kwyer Tripp, so know Andrew and Kes will stop pestering me about it. GOD that got irritating...Um...oh yah! Jocelyn and Kait showed up and there was much rejoicing (cue dance music). I ended up in a jacuzi with Linda, Aly, and Jon Boy which was crazy/weird/sweaty. We played around for a while, I ended up wearing only a pair of wet bozers, a towel, a belt, and a snow jacket. Don't ask. Ohh yah and a pair or boxers on my head. Jon spent the nite, and then this morning I had auditions for Anything Goes with Stephanie, but of course the gods felt like making my day a pain in the ass and having Stephanie's mother conveniently not at the house when Stephanie needed a ride to the audition, so my dear mother, always one to go the extra mile, postponed a few auditions and hopped in the car with me to go get Stephanie and bring her back for our audition. Luckily it all ended well, though in my audition I had some serious trouble finding my starting note. After that I ended up at Costco with my parental units, which was pretty dull, but whatever. After that, I got home and got a call from Joce asking me to hang out with her, Greg, Veronica, and Kait. What did you expect me to say? No? Of course I said yes! After dinner of yummy/spicy chinese food, I headed over there and the party began. In a single night, I: 1. Got into Veronica's pants, 2. Got into Joce's pants, 3. Got into Kait's bra, 4. Got Veronica into my boxers and pants, and 5. Slept with Joce. Damn am I good! *wink* So anyways, after all that I got home, looked at the pics from friday, sent one to Dan, and now I'm blogging away. Hopefully, Ramen Party Nite will become a permanent occurence, or at least a frequent one. And hopefull next time we can all use my hot tub instead of the Jacuzi in my parents room...

      Now that I've had my fill of Tater Tots and Ketchup comes the real fun...you have to listen to what I have to say...oh you poor souls! Anyways, come Friday there should be the beginnings of a roaring good time in my pool. Jon Boy and his new Woman (name forgotten) should have control of the hot tub, the pool should be infested by a Hairy Nazi, a short and sweet swimmer/baseball fan, the one person who knows everything about me and loves me all the same (I have no idea why..it could be my freakishly large cack but you never know...), and last but not least the not so slim but quite so sexy ME. The riotous sounds of laughter and full frontal snogging (just kidding mum) should be eminating around 4 P.M., so if you hear us just turn back to you Sports Illustrated and contuinue reading. So, I just finished my AP Test for Biology, and as soon as we have our last concert, I'm going to have my 2nd and 3rd period classes empty, which means plenty of time to do homework I was too lazy to do at home. Speaking of the devil, I actually need to get back to work, so until next time feel free to insult everything I have just said. I need an excuse to knock someones head off with a Nine Iron.   Moo and Goodbye

      Wow, I finally have my own blog...this could be really cool! I can now communicate with the world, and therefore I'd better have something cool to say...but unfortunately the attractive scents of freshly cooked Tater Tots are wafting their wai into my nostrils, so I'm gonna go have some dinner.
