      How humorous.  I've deleted my post on anti-BSB stuff...you know, it was funny...I kept my gloves on as it relates to those chumps while I had Sathya for a friend (This is ignoring the fact that a sixteen year-old female could still be in love with a bunch of Viagra-homies in their 20s and 30s...). Well, my gloves are in yesterday's garbage bin. It should be fun. The thing is, detach oneself. It would certainly make things easier. Be your own guy. Simple, eh? Yeah, sure. Break your paranoia towards the opposite gender? Easier said than done.  And then, the Disclosure. More than a day later, all the stuff I forgot to mention is coming back to me. But so is the apathy. You know, I think I was a little too forgiving when it comes to my wording. I was just far too soft. And I've blown my only shot to alter things. I gave her far too much room to work with in my terms. But then, knowing the new her, it probably won't matter a damn bit. If this doesn't draw her out,  nothing  will. But then again...Come Monday, I'll assume she read the Damned Disclosure and doesn't care...or she saw who it was from and deleted it before reading it, wasting 1600 words of effort...say, people...I'm not into raving on and on about this little ColdWar. But the one thing I do worry about is her dissecting the email for the world to see. And for that I would make my words of 11-13 seem like the  Muppet Babies . I'd regret it later, but...  Here's my policy: she can do as she pleases; I don't care anymore. There.   Well, since, as I said a week ago, I have no life, I'm out on FrontPage working on modding a site for TCS. What I need is a 778 by 92 banner to go at the top of the site.

      Ugh...what a disaster.  51-7. 51-7.  Ugh.  As a fan of both UGA and GTech, I wanted to see a good game. I had no real preference. That is, if you exclude the fact that UGA has BCS hopes riding on this game. But gosh, I thought Tech would at least make it look respectable.  UGA all the way. They did all they had to do (beat (awful) Tennessee, defeat (crappy) Alabama, defeat Auburn, defeat Tech) except Florida, and with me, that's okay. I respect Florida. Not Tennessee or Alabama (basketball reasons).  I've come across a new message board system that may be implemented soon if Tag Board continues to give problems. I've also come across a nice design for uh, TCS....it's under wraps now, so long as no concrete No. 1 contender has been crowned yet. The forums for TCS....ugh...not happening with LycosUK.  Enough for now.

       urlLink Bush Anything But Moronic, According to Author   Dark Overtones in His Malapropisms   by Murray Whyte     When Mark Crispin Miller first set out to write Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder, about the ever-growing catalogue of President George W. Bush's verbal gaffes, he meant it for a laugh. But what he came to realize wasn't entirely amusing.    Since the 2000 presidential campaign, Miller has been compiling his own collection of Bush-isms, which have revealed, he says, a disquieting truth about what lurks behind the cock-eyed leer of the leader of the free world. He's not a moron at all — on that point, Miller and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien agree.   But according to Miller, he's no friend.     There's more...

      Not much more left in the weeekend.  I've concluded my latest round of site enhancements. Let's see, shall we? One, added numerous links to DreamWorld enhanced, Two, added the moving announcements to Site One and the Portal, Three, modified the blog logo so its not just a TMK show. Using  Photoshop , Kalin, no less. Thus far, I'm impressed.  Finally joined the rest of the world and got  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon . Haven't watched it as of yet.  Moments ago, I was just browsing the ESPN BottomLine when I came across several unbelievable scores in women's basketball. #4 UConn 85, Denver 26. #5 Tennessee 126, some other college 36. Yikes. Talk about running up the scores. You'll never see this in men's b-ball...but seriously, Geno and Pat, give your opponents a rest, even if your backups are far better than their primaries. That's humiliating. And that is why I prefer Notre Dame and UGA.  Speaking of UGA, the GAME is on today. UGA vs GTech. It's on, baby. UGA should take this and their BCS check to the bank today, but look out for Tech. They don't want another trip to the Seattle Bowl.  And the Sathya oddities continue. Last night I had the following dream: Sitting at my locker, Emily finds me and hands me an unobtrusive white poster (full size) tied up with a rubber band. It reminded me of a large scroll. Anyway, I opened it up and saw that it was a giant-size note from...you guessed it. Written in sky-blue pen. It was her response to my disclosure e-mail, as I would read. Emily had disappeared by now, leaving me as the only one involved. In the response she would quote that I got what I deserved for what I said and did. It all sounded believable until the end, in which she said she'd rather kill me than forgive me (or is that actually believable? Possibly..). Anyway, the bizaare stuff continues...

      Well...if only we could get eight inches of anything nature-related down here....  golly, am I bored....looking up some mp3 players...  Trying to do a forum based on TCS has been hell in front of my eyes thus far. First I can't log in to my own database, and then I can't do squat with another one because LycosUK is so defective. At first I hoped to move DreamWorld over, and then maybe to set up a TCS supersite, but now I'm just toweling it. Far too much of a hassle. Left to me, I'd just merge the new DreamWorld site with TCS, but it's not my call, now is it?

      Hey kids, how ya doin, long time no see.  I engaged in migrainity all day yesterday so naturally I've been up all night, leaning on the windowsill. Boredom, as always, reigns supreme, and as the newspaper has not yet come and I finished my book I'm here at the blog of El Uzo.   Sadly, there's nothing to add except the (possibly apocryphal) story of the Michigan news anchor who said to her weatherman, "Hey Steve, what happened to those eight inches you promised me last night?"

      Well...it happened again.  Another Thanksgiving. Another terrorist attack. This one, I believe, we should have seen coming. I didn't see it, but the paper trail left by al Qaeda makes it seem clear if they were in fact behind this. At least the cable networks are giving this the coverage it deserves. Who'd have thought...attack the rest of the world on an American holiday? Some statement.  It took almost three hours to get it right, but the Final Disclosure e-mail is done and waiting to send. It's almost 1600 words in length. Yeah, 2.5 pages. Almost like an essay. I won't say I want it to affect her, but I hope she at least reads it and soaks it in.  Happy Thanksgiving, all.

      (riminy!!!  What a slow day...no work done, no DreamWorld...600 came and went....aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!  Sorry. Just extremely bored.  I've settled on the iRiver 128MB, Kalin, in case you've heard of it. Of course, I think I'll still keep an eye out on the Pod.  I guess it would be nice if more than just two guys posted here. Was browsing blogs through blogger.com and came across a group blog, which I don't see many of. It sure would be nice if this could grow. Speaking of growth,  TCS  vs. DreamWorld is up next.  Here are the options I've established for now: 1.  urlLink Temp site for TCS  2.  urlLink  TCS via DreamWorld  3. Kalin's independent, separate hosting (of which I'm in the dark to) 4. The least workable but most favorable solution, via LycosUK,  urlLink this  piece of unresponsive crap.  Ambrose Bierce? Yes. Gonna do some research on him.

      I did it again.  I woke up and promptly pulled a muscle in my thigh...no stretching, just getting out of bed...(riminy for $5000....  But the real story of the overnight was the dream. There's not much to write about it, but I think I will add it to the DW site...the bizaare part about this one is that Sathya had the same essential dream during the summer.  The same one . It struck a chord in me when I woke up. She wanted me to post hers during the summer, and I said it was too personal and not substantial enough to merit me spending an hour fixing hers up for it. I think I'll show her some courtesy and do likewise.   And then, the night before, I dreamt about collecting fish, much like stamps. This one I'll have to add to the database. All of a sudden, I'm having dreams again. Good.  On my docket for today: Orthodontist appt. at 10 Several NR2002 races to simulate math hw to do

      Hello. Found a really cool new site. It's called Alexa(www.alexa.com). You search for sites and people rate them. I got some reviews from four years ago for a very old version of my site that were good, but I didn't see any for DreamWorld(one of the old ones). It uses Google's search engine, so that's why ours are on there. Of course after I explained that the link was dead and my new site hadn't been recognized by Google yet, they erased the comments. This seems to be a good way to find out what others think about your website though. I still have to ask JC about the TCS thing. Blog definetely looks better. Good choice of templates. Just had problems with the tag board, but it is a free service so you know...

      Lame Duck Day II is complete.  I checked out CNET, and I'm leering at the iRiver or something like that. Of course, I'll go after the iPod first (not that I really want it, but it  does  hold a lot of stuff).  I consider it pointless to have two  TCS  sites. Far more work than necessary. Ideally, I could redo the new DreamWorld and merge it with any new  TCS  site. Yes, that's greedy, but I consider it business.  While wishing Sathya a nice holiday, her response generated a heated internal discussion. Of course, as one would hope, it was "You too." But then I began to wish she hadn't said that. All of a sudden it seems as though I can't have a good  anything  anymore. It's been all downhill, it seems. Bad luck, terrible choices, inattentiveness, emptiness, frustration, flustration, you name it, I got it. And, speaking of her, it's time I prepared the full disclosure message. It's going to be up to her to decide whether or not she reads it.  And for now, I rest.

      I'll reiterate this for all newcomers... I'm not overly sentimental, nor am I a rage machine, nor am I spiteful.  I am  me , a faceless, secretly dangerous character.   Whoa, enough with the spooks. What I'm trying to say is, take it easy on this guy. And try to keep my content on the Internet  only .Thanks.   Uh...sure, I suppose, Kalin.  I'll need to go back to alter your link, true. I know the world wants to see your talent.  And about  TCS ...I did offer to do the site, but you can do it if you prefer. Just find a way to link to me while you're at it, lol. I'm hearing that the first edition of the rerelease was postponed...oh well...I wiish people would join the DWClub for all of this...speaking of which, I've posted a new dream. Head on over there (link is underneath archives on left, DW Enhanced) to read it.  Emily brought something rather thought-provoking to my mind earlier in the day. She observed that I can never seem to have a good day. And she has a darn good point. It was indeed before November 14, or August 12, for that matter, that this started. Maybe I'm depressed and hate life to no end. It's possible, I suppose. I'm lacking optimism in a hard way. Defensive pessimism can only get me so far. Boy, defensive pessimism beats the blue crap out of optimism for me, anyway...burst bubbles of optimism can get very messy.  I'm done with the rivalries. Life will come as it will, will it not? One can't hate people for what they do (or don't do) in relation to you. Enough wisdom drivel...so...  DreamWorld may be moving to lycos UK....established account, working on implementing PHP stuff.  Lame Duck Day One is complete. Another half left.

      Hey Uzo. My site is up and running as you probably already know, so you can link to the comics section again with the new URL. Hooray for tommorow! A half day, finally! Good luck with the mp3 player. Remember, CNET knows best...  Oh BTW. Speaking of the "Thought Crime Syndicate"...I might be able to publish that officially on my site and give everyone who likes to read it the link. Just a thought. I'll talk to Jick about it.

      Okay, it's time for the Lame Duck Days of school, tomorrow and Tuesday.  I'm watching   Broadcast News  (1987), starring William Hurt and Holly Hunter. It is a  classic . Yeah, that explains why it's on AMC....was just channelsurfing for Alias (not airing tonight) when I came across it...it's awesome...I wish I could have taped it. It vaults right away into my TMK's Lifetime Top Five Movies....insiders call it unrealistic and stereotyped, I call it moving and dramatic, regardless of how realistic it is or is not.  While channelsurfing, I came across the Slums of Beverly Hills (1998). What kept my attention was a schocking scene in which the female lead stimulated herself to uh...yes, the pinnacle of pleasure...but for nearly a minute I could not tell what it was. For thirty seconds the camera close-shot her face, which morphed from an almost pained expression to a dim smile. A dull whirring sound ran in the background. The camera then cut to, get this, her legs, with her underwear at her feet. No nudity, of course, but everything else was highly suggestive in nature. In any case, she had "finished" and pulled her hands to her chest. In her hands, surprisingly, was something that looked distinctly like a banana. Only it wasn't a banana.  I thought this kind of stuff was for premium TV, not WE (yeah, go figure, that was where I stopped channelsurfing minutarily)...interesting night nonetheless...550 hits, eh? Not bad considering that a week ago we were still sniffing 490.

      About those Falcons...it certainly can't be a good day for Panthers fans...it's 41-0 as I type this and we just picked off another pass...this reminds me of 1998, only this team has more excitement. The Panthers have five turnovers! Yikes.  I've completed the Harry Potter rip. On review, though, I may as well just buy the DVD as one legally should.   Today's been quiet thus far, just doing physics homework now.  I actually had a dream of note last night....ah, the dangers of underage, inexperienced driving...that's all I can say as of now. I'll post it on DreamWorld when I can, hopefully today.  After yesterday's big post, I went back and had a look. It  was  Sathya. Her visits are unmistakeable when they do occur. I'm surprised. I nearly deleted her from the site a little while ago. Just kidding. Even I wouldn't do that. But anyway...  it's back to the laugh again.

Who are we kidding? 25 turnovers? Unacceptable. Maybe the Big Dog and JT should put a little glue on their hands. Silverbacks: They don't really suck, but imagine the things they could do if they had any money...  Ah, well...

      Round Two. Encore.  Fifty page views today, seven actual unique views. Uh-uh. Yeah. The Update. I hope people like it. I gave it the Christmas feel.  Anyway, temperamental as I am, my sources are telling me that the feature player paid us a visit this evening. It adds up, but I would be shocked if this was true. And of course, any acknowledgement of such a hope punches a vulnerability in me which can be exploited by those who know how.  For crying out loud, I don't hate the woman.I still love her like crazy (not in a physical manner) and miss her like a guy misses his lady.  She just pushed me off my limit without her knowing it. And I lashed out at her. From what I've heard, I scared the crap out of her, considering she thought I still loved her like I used to. I then allegedly made her mad because it appeared as though I gave her no warning and then called her a...well... I gave her enough warning and she didn't put the puzzle together, or I didn't do my job as a displeased friend. The thing that gets me is that it could have been avoided. But it's almost too late. I doubt she and I will ever be anything near what we were.  That  is why I seem so nonchalant about the whole thing. The impression I could have made on her tonight was well wasted. As usual.  Anyway, I could go on about her for ages, and I did basically all this week.  Have you ever sat down to just peruse blogs? It's cool. I'd say that every other blog has something memorable in them. I wish mine had something like that. But no, I'm just out here doing boring stuff, raving like a hopeless romantic and whatnot.  Hearing Robby finished 10th overall in the BAJA 1000. That's unacceptable. I mean, good that he finished, but he expected to WIN. Not encounter wheel problems while leading. Typical Robby Gordon luck. Hey, until February 16, 2003.  I miss my pizza. Back when I was younger, I could wolf down at least six slices (80% of a large pizza) by myself. But slowly, I've had to curb my enthusiasm. Five, then four. And tonight, three. Four made me sick in early October. Three and out. Ugh.

      Okay, quizzes aside. Let's duel.  I do recall saying that today had been a quiet day online. That was until six PM. Since I have no life at all, I've been on the PC just long enough to run into Julia on AIM.  Some people I know, and I don't plan on naming names here, seem to think my attachment to her is dangerous for my own being, considering the fact I've never met her in person. It's like they think I've no restraint at all or something. Hey, yo! I get it, people. I mean, it would be incredibly stupid on my part to get too attached to her since any old schmo (or schmo-ette) could change an SN and be on his/her merry, TMK-less way. Or hey, what if I made another misstep akin to the one I made on Sathya? Easy answer. No contact. Period. Come on. Maybe they're jealous? They'd better not be. Go figure, though, that this is the same medium in which we met.   This pain, this pleasure. Five hundred hits worth of fun. Four hundred hits of intrigue.  Last weekend I was fraying at the edges over Sathya. Not this go-round. I've concluded that what I did merely closed the book on our relationship, albeit with a bookmark on page 451 (significant number). It was swinging shut before I let the world in on our little problem. There is where I gather my solace. Next week, I will send out the last e-mail to her as a friend and the first as a DreamWorld Correspondent only.  I've been added to the Thought Crime Syndicate. My alias: Kazoo Four. When stuff starts to come together, I'll begin work on a website. I should probably start researching my first article, though.  Golly, mates...no one of real note online today...I need a life so for once  I  won't notice this so often! Any ideas?  Next week, however, I don't believe I'll be working on a brand butt-smackin' new blog like this one. Just blogging.

      An interesting incident from the morning...  I'm in the 10th grade restrooms taking a leak (hey, isn't that what one's supposed to do in a restroom?), when Cody (our broadcasting humormachine) walks into the stall adjacent to mine.  I'm thinking subconsicously about a joke Ms. Weksler (8th grade French...she gave me the now regrettable idea of taking French, teaching it so well she did) told us... When you go in the bathroom you're French, when you come out you're German. What are you when you're in the bathroom? Eur-a-peein.... .Anyway...while I was thinking that during my twenty seconds of self-relief...  Cody opens, "You go in the bathroom and you're French, and when you come out you're German. What are you when you're in the bathroom?" You bet. I was shocked.  The same joke enters the minds of two people while both are in the urinal at the same time. Is it the toilets?

      Almost done downloading the Harry Potter movie (the first one) off Kazaa...Soon I'll have the second. But first things first, The Sum of All Fears...   "Bridgestone Presents the  ChampCar World Series  Powered by Ford."  THAT is a handful. From CART FedEx Championship series to that? Yikes. I say that Champcar fans should just call the new CART "CWS"...or at least single out the part about Champcars. All's we need now is for Papyrus to make us all a nice new CART sim.  I like it, nonetheless. It beats the blue hell out of my idea, the American Grand Prix Series...but I'm not a factor. They (CART marketing) did what they could, and boy is ChampCar World Series nice. It reminds me of 1995, when CWS was still the PPG Indycar World Series...(see the similarities?)...there was no Indy (Evil) Racing League...just the Indycars and NASCAR.  The CWS awards banquet is taking place today and Friday in Miami...MORE announcements are expected...oh la la...

       urlLink NPR : Do You Know Where Afghanistan Is?   It's really disappointing, how stupid some of kids are. The article basically speaks for itself...I kind of got really mad and all when I heard all of this from NPR, so...  Adult America, please, take your pills. You may not like your retirement-era world when you get to living in it. Take GW Bush, multiply him by 3000 and spread him throughout our government. Yes. Or worse, even. When we rank so poorly in what should have been a routine Geography check, there's a problem.   Look no further than our school system.

      Again, another embarrassing post...sorry, all newcomers, I'm usually in a better state of mind than I was yesterday.  I'm usually not: excessively sentimental excessively sorrowful excessively angry, nor am I  an optimistic thinker.  What I can say is that I had a half-bad day, a marked improvement over the last week. It has been one hell ride of a week, seeing the future inevitable become the past and present...falling apart to a different me than even I'm familiar with...  500 hits is on the horizon, but I may soon be looking for a new hit counter....that green is an eyesore, (riminy for $699.   Aced my second straight math quiz, but it's bittersweet. I should have been doing this all along. I suck at math (and physics) but when I actually resolved to try, I did fine. Optimism? No, just pointed realism.  Bought a Jay-Z double CD set today, spent several minutes on the bus listening to it. Quite good. It's got a flavor for almost every style of rap, and in case you didn't already know, Jay-Z can rock the mic.   NHR e-mailed me...how strange...they're delaying shipment of the book a full month...at least they told me first, and at least they confirmed my order.

      It's become impossible to get into the Blogger interface, so I'll just use the short method for now.  Hope, what is that? My sense of it died with any hope of seeing a meteor this morning. We're through, but it's an awkward silence for me. The one time I did pause to look at her, I nearly fell apart again. This childish fall in love stuff must end. Soon. Or else I'll be putting the finishing touches on my life for all of you to see.  Anyway...I had another crap day. No good days since I turned 16, and this is no surprise. It'll take a miracle for something good to happen to me.

      Today was encouraging and depressing all at once.  Depressing in that I had facial surgery at the dermatologist's office, so now my face is consequently red and sore. "But it's for the better," they tell me," but don't go to the Prom looking like this!" Yeah, if I even make it to the Prom, much less have a date.  Let's see...encouraging in that it seemed that the feature player in this blog who doesn't post here (read: she's female) seemed to almost say "Let's forget about it" to me on my second apology run. Whether or not she said that because she meant it or if she wanted me to get off her about it is unclear. I will say that it lifted my spirits to see her smile again. Okay, enough mushy crap. But still, what she's still doing will affect me, just not as much because I understand now.  I made the deal for Kalin's CD player. It's damned good looking. And playing. It'll have to be up to the task on the bus tomorrow, the first day I have to spend extended time in the same space as our feature player in the last 5 days. Uh-oh.  I misspelled awesome in yesterday's entry. Embarrassing.  I like the tune of the ChampCar World Series, (CART's presumptive new name)...Awards banquet on the 21st and 22nd.    RIP rpm2night . Sweet dreams, Totally NASCAR. I need Speed Channel, dammit!  Anyway, I'm being hurried for dinner. And I'm famished.

      Uh...just coming off another REDOUBTABLE Alias...let's go.  I would wish Tony Stewart congrats on his first Winston Cup title (which I remember predicting correctly before the season and holding to after the Daytona 500), but I won't because Tony is a big racer but a little man. Perhaps the comments on Robby last week did it, but still...he shoved a photographer at Indy after getting mad because he sucked in the race...come on...And so I don't get accused of spur-of-the-moment stuff a year from now, my 2003 pick for Cup champ is Ryan Newman of the Alltel #12 Dodge. I would also hope Robby Gordon can make a real impact next year along with the rest of RCR and have a really solid season.  Football fans are so obnoxious at their worst. Like the Cleveland fans. But I believe I know the most annoying fan, and it's a shame that I've got to say it, but I live with him. He's my dad. So hard to deal with when watching football, especially GTech and Falcons games. Sometimes I wish he would just stop running his mouth and watch the game like I do. Quietly (for the most part). But this is football. Who (unless you're at the track) whoops and hollers about racing on TV? Yeah.  I've spent enough time thinking about my mistake this weekend and I've decided that this could all have been avoided if we had been truthful to each other from the start. I do not absolve myself of the blame for what I said, but the two people who told her of my comments took them out of context. I said, even then, that the only thing I would dislike her for would be "not telling me the truth" and sidestepping it when I broached the topic. Yeah, guys, tell her that if you want. You misread the bitch comment, read this one correctly. Anyway, I guess it's my turn to avoid her. She's powerful when she's against me, and I'd rather not contend with that power. For now, I'll be content with a role reversal.

      WHY are we so worried about Iraq?  So he's allegedly gassing Kurds (I'm not saying that's a condonable thing). So he's working on WMDs. Iraq is also one of the poorest countries in the world, thanks to US-led sanctions. Burn me if I'm wrong, but there is simply no way Saddam and his gov't will develop anti-US weapons without us knowing about it. Especially since weapons inspectors are returning.   Saddam is only a threat to his own country and  maybe  Israel and a few other countries in the middle east. The country the US should be more worried about is North Korea. I've nothing against the people of  the DPRK, but they are more of a threat.  The nuclear programme being developed is quite a threat. To China (although they're still socialist brothers), to South Korea, to Japan, maybe even to Russia. Three of the world's top ten powers, two of which are major trading partners with the United States. Japan has no capability to retaliate with nuclear force, nor does South Korea. China's force is antiquated, but most effective in short-range wars ( Taiwan, India, Pakistan, Japan, Russia, and so forth). Russia...well...they need to work some issues out.  We should be more worried about North Korea than harmless little Iraq.  That's just my op.

      Okay...let's see...one nightmare about her is quite enough for me to want to get the point. I'm going to back off completely...if she wants to play the avoid-and-ignore, I'll make it a co-ed game. No prob. Note: there is no sense of underlying hostility anymore, I'm just accepting it like a cocky SOB like me should. The nightmare? Take the dangerous look in her eyes, her tone from yesterday, and attach them to a driver in a car. Concisely speaking, I was hit by a car. Repeatedly. It wasn't fun.  Some would like to say that I'm characterized by mind games. That is simply not true. TMK? TMK is my confidence, my power. Without him, I'm either a dead teen or an emotionless shell. I don't like mind games, since I usually lose at them (this case being an example. I do not like engaging in them to win. However, they happen because I exist. One of us (insert name here) at CHS seems to think that I enjoy them, and that I look for ways to win, and that I ponder that a certain person is always trying to screw me over. Not true. I simply wondered what she was thinking. Period. And since I knew what was going on, I took umbrage in the fact that she could not bring herself to tell me the truth. The result: what happened over the last three weeks.  In any case, though, Sathya and Phil make an interesting duo. No, I'm not laughing as I type this. Be serious. It should be interesting to observe this one to see where I embarked on the relationship-killing tangent. If anyone is offended that I said that, too bad. It is what it is. I wish them the best.  Since I was practically raked over the coals for insulting Sathya (and I knew I would be from the start) and then Kalin, and insinuated Alan (although he was an innocent bystander), I'm adding a disclaimer to the site. If you people can't handle what I have to say, go away and don't come back. What is here will remain here. I will no longer discuss what I say here in public. Neither shall you,  no matter what I said .

      And before I run off...I'm not a lyrics guy, and had better not be confused with one, but I thought this was touchingly appropriate. I'm off to go drown my (mostly initiated) sorrows. How I cannot say. If I don't turn up on Monday...well, I hope I turn up on Monday. I should move my locker away from her, but where do I run to?  WHY?   I Will Remember You   (by Sarah McLachlan, Seamus Egan, and Dave Merenda)   I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  Remember the good times that we had? I let them slip away from us when things got bad How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one  I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so tired but I can't sleep Standin' on the edge of something much too deep It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard   But I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to loose Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light  And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories  And I will remember you Will you remember me? Don't let your life pass you by Weep not for the memories Weep not for the memories

      Tangible positives aside, today ranked in the top three for worst in my life.  Why couldn't she have told me? Why couldn't she have told me sooner?  As I suspected all along, she has gotten sick of me. I had a strange feeling that this was the case, and it took a triple dose of Kalin, Phil, and Ben to get the point across. My recent actions only pushed this thing out of my control.  Apparently, I loved her  too  much. She didn't like the undivided attention I concentrated on her. I mean damn, she's the best female friend I'd ever had. Ever. She commanded my attention. Alas, she never wanted it. And that is why I wish she had told me sooner (at all, really). I think that she thinks that I'm too clingy. Clingy?! Yes.  She could have informed me she that hated me. But no! Rather than not tell me to avoid hurting my feelings, she resorted to being freaked-out about everything and began avoiding and ignoring me. As though that worked. By still not having told me, I will hold it against her (not seriously, as I've been misread previously,*cough*).  Not telling me at all hurt me even more than actually doing so would have  (things would have been made much easier because then I could accept it readily). (Read: I don't hate her and never have, I just become infuriated from time to time, looking for a scapegoat. However, the fact that she didn't trust me enough to tell me and that she just left me to my own deductive reasoning is devastating.)  The part of me that wanted, for once, to get someone back, has succeeded. But at what cost? Sathya? Just because of TMK?  I thought I knew the definition of a broken heart. Until I went face to face with her. I looked at her and saw mine vaporized. She looked hurt, and she didn't at the same time. The saying goes that you can find a lot by looking in a woman's eyes. I saw something that I'd never want to see again. Ever.  We're brushing off the fact that she walked by me as though I was invisible and the fact that she said nothing of importance after my apology.  As far as she goes, she and I are done. It's gone, not broken. I feel empty without her, but I'd better start filling the hole, and fast.  Or I'll die trying.

      Well.  Now I'm spooked.  And now I have about a half-dozen apologies to make.  I admit being quite a fiery person, especially when my ire is raised. That, however, does not excuse my actions and words as of late.  I will say, though that yesterday's blog was a RANT. I probably should have put a disclaimer saying, "I probably don't mean all of this and I'm just mad" on it at the start.  1. Alan doesn't have anything to do with it; you dragged him into it. 2.Kalin: I did not say I hated you. I just said I felt betrayed. Period. You're still my top guy friend. 3. Sathya. I'm at a loss now. I can't say I don't care anymore. But this is pushing my patience. And my sanity. The last two months have been a living hell for me.  4. HAVE YOU NOTICED LATELY?...that I've not been the same person I used to be? Yes. I answered that question already. And Sathya had little to do with that.  4.5. When I find my heart, I'll be back. Right now it's in a million pieces.  5. Am I suicidal? Maybe. Is that why I'm suddenly alienating everyone I know? Yes.  6. I've had it. Enough. You guys will see a different me sometime down the line. But not now.  7. I've made the world as I like it HATE me. You're all losing patience with me. I understand. But please, I'm losing patience and contact with you all.

      Hmm...some kind of day.  As I suspected the minute I posted the big entry from yesterday, someone had something to say about it. I  was  mad, but I also set a trap in the process. And it should be no surprise that someone fell into it, dragging at least two others in as well.  I snookered you. As planned.  After a power nap during French, I felt revitalized and had a new outlook on things. Focus. Sharp. Intense. Humorless. Businesslike. That's the way I wish I was. Only things never materialize like so in actuality. That turned me into desperation incarnate. But no longer. Power-spree.  Ha. Ha. Ha.  The TMK Offensive is picking up steam.

      Uhh...someone I know could probably take a hint.   urlLink MenWeb - Men's Issues: The Ten Things Women Do That Drive Men Away   8. BEING HARD AND COLD  "I work the graveyard shift so I don't have to be at home with my wife." --Derek, police officer  That response was from a man who had been married less than one year and was already engaged in a cold war with his wife. Most of the time she was openly disrespectful to him as a human being, not just as a man. Other times she was cold and aloof, barely acknowledging that he was in the room. Believe it or not, men have feelings too. Hard and cold behavior is enough to drive anyone away. Again, we aren't asking to be cradled like babies. But every man wants home to be a safe refuge from the cold-hearted world. However, when the world at home is colder than the work world, there is no solace.

      Another day, another meaningless post. About those lyrics...I thought they were...meaningful...in my eyes.  Updates: Created the suicide blog, which has nothing to do with suicide at all. Just me without the hindrances of Blogger. Recarpeted basement today...looking at a party in the next week. Got kind of freaked when this page went down this afternoon. Really surprised.   A few choice words:     Johnny Brown's  money-gobbling tactics have already gotten him into deep mush. He's already overspent the county budget by some $30,000 in less than four months. He's also reduced the fine arts funding by 65% to about $750 worth of funding, according to CHS teachers.  We had an  intruder alert  a couple of days ago during the 9:30-10:20 class, physics. Just as a casual show of disobedience, Ms. Johnson, our teacher strides outside right after the announcement came to close all doors. Just a five-second show, but quite amusing. She said something about the actual code for a real intruder...something about "get your roll books" and a library meeting...hmm...  About  substitute teachers ...we had one today in French (and a long-as-hell packet w/ instructions written in French, and since we can hardly speak or decipher sentences...long work...c'est pas terrible, oui.). Anyway, the usual suspects were out to make life a living hell for our 60+ year old substitute. WHY?!? Why do we act even worse than usual for substitute teachers? They're trying to make a living, for chrissakes! Why should we do all we can to hinder them? I mean, they (most of them) just do as the teachers tell them to. It's just disheartening.  Some girl walks up to me, asking for a pencil.  Dialogue : Person: Hey, do you have a pencil I can use? Me: Yeah, but I don't want to let you use it. Person: Why? Me: Because you're ugly. (PAUSE) Just kidding. Here. Person: What the hell? Where'd your heart go? Me: Ask ------ over there. She might know. Person: Aww...that's sad. Thanks anyway.  And while I'm at it...the intensity of the  forcefield between us  continues to grow. She thought she could isolate me from her, eh? Eh-eh. TMK ain't havin' it. Not happening. If she's going to do that, then I'm going to reciprocate. I've already begun, actually. I think, though, that if she would ever speak to me again (more than a passing "Hey" or a brief "Happy Birthday"),  I would ask the question that's been terrorizing me for the last 2.6 months.    "Why?"   If I knew that, perhaps I would stop the  mindgames  and try something different. But no, she keeps singling me out from everything she does. When she's talking, I'm not. When I'm talking, she's not. When we both are, it's in two separate conversations. Fine. This is ruining my mind, but the only thing that keeps me going is...hope. Hope and I are not friends, but I'm willing to work with it. And revenge. Revenge is a good friend of mine, but I don't call upon him much.  Anyway...it's Physics Weekend at the TMK domus.

      (riminy for $10,000.  Progess reports today. No surprises, really.  php Postnuke is nice, but mobyNuke isn't givin me many options.  End of a friendship update: Gosh, what I would pay to get my hands on her! But no, I wouldn't dare. She's strangling me. And there's no way to talk to her. At all. In conversations with more than just us, she finds the easy-out to exclude me. Now I can do the same.  I liken it all to "throwing in the towel." I threw it two weeks ago, and every little positive microburst sees me run over to pick it up and wipe down. But when I'm stooping to pick it up, the towel suddenly showers me in urine, making me remember why I threw it in the first place.  Cannot f'n believe I called her special on Saturday!! I'm too temperamental. I have other words I could use for her, but they aren't exactly nice. Looks like the days of the online conversations are at an end. At least with me, anyway. There's someone else in the equation. Won't divulge his name. His AIM profile says enough.  The Last Two weeks: Given up, gotten mad, tried to get her back by apologizing, nearly succeeded, gotten mad, given up, gotten mad, tried to get her back, and gotten extremely mad this time.  I end by formally wishing the worst possible luck to her for the time being. Maybe when I consult my "source" I'll feel differently about her. But not now. For now, as much as I wished I could have her back, I'd rather see her stranded in the middle of Nowhere, Alaska.

       urlLink TheSpark.com's Famous Personality Test  MASTERMIND (Submissive Introvert Abstract Thinker )   Like just 8% of the population you are a MASTERMIND (SIAT). You can be silent and withdrawn, but behind your reserved exterior lies an active mind that allows you to analyze situations and come up with creative, unexpected solutions. Normal people call this "scheming." Don't learn German.   Anyway, your sense of style and originality are your strengths, and people will respect your judgment once they get to know you. If you learn to be a little more personable, you could be a great leader--you've definitely got the "vision" thing down. Just make sure all the plotting you do behind those eyes of yours is healthy.   Famous masterminds in television: Dr. Claw, The Scarecrow and Mrs. King, Montgomery Burns.

      It's been a while since my last entry, and I see a correlation between that and the dearth in hits lately. 4 hits in the last two days, one of them an outside hit.  Yesterday morning, I got onto a different bus to head to school, and boy was I dismayed to experience what I did. First of all, an auto accident had just occurred near the shuttle. One guy, I suppose (I was sitting in front of all that went down), sitting with someone who appeared to be his GF, was noticeably gawking at the scene. Three cars were involved, and an ambulance had arrived. Thus far, I could understand. But then...  "Let's wait a little longer! I wanna see someone get taken off in a stretcher!" he said enthusiastically. His seatmate went quiet. I struggled to remain calm. What in the blue hell? You (understood "you")  want  to see someone taken away in that state? I'll admit it, I'm not very sensitive, but (riminy! Would you still want to if that was your dad? Or your mother? Or your sister?  And then, not long after, this other girl, whom I suspect is in my French class, gives a loud belch. Of course, no "excuse me." And then another guy turns to face her, obviously disgusted. She responds to it by saying, "Don't like it? Get off my bus!" I can't imagine what that guy was thinking.  What happened to manners and sensitivity in the 00s youth?  And then...why aren't we students learning enough? Has anyone considered the laziness of our teachers? My example: while waiting to start class in French, our teacher spent five full minutes talking to some other teachers outside the room. Five minutes that could have been used to teach were used to discuss dinner plans (Okay, maybe not). Regardless, we need the teachers to start doing their part. Completely. We get detentions and suspensions for dilly-dallying like that, why shouldn't teachers?  I need to pick one place to go in the hallways. I find it odd that every time I decide to go one way in traffic, the other person is thinking the same thing. And then we both change our minds at the same time, to the same new place. And then I have to stop and let the other guy go. (riminy for $6000, please.  I've started up the new DreamWorld. It's taken a long while, but it's coming along. Postnuke is the name of this game.

      Birthday to me.  Not much in the cards for today...maybe do a little gloating, now that I've finally caught up with most of the rest of the juniors...maybe talk to Jules a little...  Speaking of cards...where's mine? Just kidding. Actually, a very special person sent me one. Today I'm willing to make nice. She sent me a card, but it took me a moment to realize she'd sent it back when things were good, in the summer. I just hope it's not one of those mirages in the desert.  I received a leather jacket, although I never asked for one...it's one thing I've always had an eye for, leather jackets, but when I actually get it it's not as great as it once seemed. No offense to the parents. It's great! Just not what I "expected."

       urlLink Friendship Profiles based on Sun Signs   The mysterious Scorpion may turn out to be the best friend you've ever had -- or your worst enemy. The first rule of friendship with a Scorpio is that you never, ever cross them. Their sting is strong, and they never forget a wrong done to them. That said, it's fairly easy to keep your Scorpio friendship intact, and, as soon as you prove that you are worthy of their devotion, they will be a loyal comrade. You will never know what is on their mind, and you may not have any idea where you stand with them, but their secrets will always fascinate you. Kissing up is a major turnoff for your Scorpion pal, so let them know how great they are without fawning all over them. Scorpio does not have too many friends, but they hold on tight to the ones they do. Friendship is not the most important thing in their lives, but they will stay true to a long-term companion. A Scorpio will gladly give you the shirt off their back if you need it, but you may get the slightest inkling that they have an ulterior motive for doing so. Friendship with the Scorpion will always be full of surprises.  All too true.

      Oh, looky, looky. It's November 1. November 2 if you're Jippy (see bottom of the page). The almost in "Almost 16" will be gone in six hours, much to my infinite dismay. That's right, 16 is the newest milestone in my lifetime.  Being fifteen was a defining year in my all-too-short life, now that I reflect on it. Lots of positives, equally as many negatives.  - Positives  --Maintaining my outward  sang froid , as I've learned to do for the last five years. -- New friends , namely Emily and Sathya. Although one of them removed herself from the Deal, they were probably the two best new friends I've come to know in the past year. Both of them I would trust with my life, although one of them much less so than the other. --- The emergence of TMK , a different me, as I came to know him. I'd say he was responsible for the above positive, and he's become the Uber-me I wish I was.   -Negatives  -- Paying the price of Ms. Knapp's opinions... cost me a B in Lit damned near ruined me. She strikes something akin to fear and loathing into my heart whenever she passes within my line of sight. -- The emergence of TMK.  While positive, he's been the one pushing me to the dark side. I've left my sense of humor behind me, nine tenths of my contentedness, if there is such a word, and replaced it with a cold fury only a select few will ever know about. -- The loss of a trusted friend.  The previous negative is crucial to what happened between Sathya and myself. All of a sudden there were two players in my mind, and there's not enough room for the three of us to coexist. TMK's power over me has showed lately, in the past month, and in particularly here, in the past week, and for confidential reasons I will not elaborate.  That's pretty much it, for Nov. 2, 2001 through Nov. 1, 2002. I will HATE being sixteen.  Anyways, another update to the End of A Friendship storyline...this is killing me inside, but it's making me a much more powerful guy on the outside. I nearly picked a fight early in the morning with a guy on crutches after he poked me with them. It's emptying my emotions, and leaving me as more of a shell than I already am. That's what happens when you pull your heart from the top of your bookshelf, give it to someone who claimed to care, only to find out later that she's cut it into pieces and served it for dinner. Or worse, played pinball with it. And yes, that's a pretty direct message. I felt a bit of remorse for saying what I said earlier in the week, but it took less than ten seconds of her silence to remind me of why we're not friends in the first place and why I'm doing it.   Taking cheapshots at her? I wish it didn't have to be this way. But she's killed my will to even talk things out. There's an invisible forcefield standing there, and I can't even figure out how I got locked out in the first place!  I recall telling myself in mid-Sept. that if I gave up trying, this would slipslide into a slow, torturous death. I haven't been wrong thus far.

      I honestly can't believe it. Another day, another party, (no) thanks to my dad and his socialitic tendencies.  Hoping that my lunatic enhancement works as planned...also hoping the new TCS board materializes as hoped. Yeah, I gave up on the current forum and decided for remotely hosted. Xsorbit, as recommended by Kalin, is awful in terms of its customizability. Thusly, I opted for something better, which incorporates the Yabb forum code....it's better. Period. And I hope to have a prelim down soon.  Happy New Year.

      Ah, the sight of love is in the air...choke, choke. Where's the barfbag when you need one?  Was going to add a blogAmp to this thing, but blogspot doesn't give FTP access (of course). And I really don't want to add it to DreamWorld...the next time I go to DreamWorld in Trellix, the first thing I'll do is delete Sathya's page. And then Kalin's. And finally, mine. And simply replace all three of them with a master site. Of course, with links everywhere, to this place, and to the Master list for dreams. This is step two in moving on.  An oddly busy day here...Blogger.com's hit me five times today. And, not to mention, the search engines. The search for "major turnoff in sex hairy women" comes to mind right there.  One place where it's also busy: Unwillingsuburbanite.com...Shalin's put down an excellent (different) redesign on the site.

      It's almost the end of 2002...thank heavens. What a dreadful year. Halfway into it, I thought it was one of the best I'd ever had...by the end, well...I was crazy enough to write my own year in review thingy...Before I start, I'll bet anyone $500 that I'll find myself equivocating by the time this is over.  Jan-Mar. 2002- Could have been worse. The Crime and Punishment essay was probably one of the toughest things from there. It was pretty smooth sailing in Q1 2002. Of course, I was in the process of adding another friend who just happened to be by my locker and I'd never noticed her until Q4 2001.  Apr-Jun. 2002- Music project practically ruined things for me. Otherwise, I was decent on the finals. Paul Tracy really won the Indy 500, but Helio Castroneves will be the official winner. That was a stupid incident, when Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials allowed an appeal of the finish to go on, only to find out appeals weren't even allowed. There's $250,000 out of Team Green's (Tracy's team) bank account. The school year did end, by the way. What began was, now that I look back at it, the beginning of the nightmares.   May 27-30, 2002: Submission of several dreams I'd had, intertwined with a couple of lively discussions with Sathya and Kalin about a web site. By the end of May, plans were finalized for DreamWorld. During June 2002, I posted some damned interesting dreams from Sathya, Kalin, and myself. So fun, really...Sathya used to ask me for little "tickers"...who had posted more dreams...she was always on the point, and by several, too. She usually had more than Kalin and I did combined. Enough of her, really. DW was not a Sathya thing, although it sure did seem that way at times. DreamWorld was my June.  Jul-Sep. 2002: Early in July, I initiated plans for DreamWorld: Site One, the supersite for DW. While I built the site (week 1, Jul) I went to Greensboro. A wrinkle did fall into my plans when Sathya had a little thing to go to...so in the meantime I tried other stuff to keep busy. The month went by quickly, and school loomed on the horizon. August approached, and with that the ultimate end to DreamWorld. I hate to say it, but I'm glad DW is not what it used to be. Why? Because (as school started), in late August I came up with my own little blog. Once titled  The Lunatic Speaks... , I was really grasping at straws during the first week. Of course, I changed the title to the current one and so forth. Personal-wise, Aug-Sep was a blur for me. I wish it wasn't, since it seems that I began to care about one person too much...so much that I wound up pushing her away from me without my even realizing it. Well, I did, but I couldn't believe it until much later. Homecoming came and went, and surprisingly someone asked me to go. I turned her down. Why? I wish I knew. I shouldn't have, foolish me.  Oct-Dec. 2002- The flu, early October. Met Julia online, late October. The mini-explosions about some person (late October, early November). The "end" (well, not officially since she won't even acknowledge my existence anymore) of that friendship (Nov. 12-15). The Letter (Nov. 27). Nothing. Q4 2002 altered my life, this time for the worse. And now I'm stuck living a life I never really imagined I would. I never  thought I would have a blog with a thousand visits (not hits). I didn't think I would have become a contributor to the school's most popular (and only) underground newspaper. I didn't think I could have begun a brief flame war with someone over his iPod (and his motives about replacing it), only to get something that holds even more than his does. At years end, I did prove my 2003 horoscope partially right, at least in the love category.  Made a few friends, made a lot of enemies. Some of these enemies, though, were surprising by their identities. Take one of them (should be an easy guess) for example. She went from "Who in the blue hell is she?" to "She can do no wrong" to "What kind of...why would she do that?" to "Worst nightmare", all in 365 days. Very simple.  2002 Final Rating: C-, for being such a hothead during Qs 2-4. And also C, for (riminy.  2003 Outlook...well, I've begun to harness my dark side, which is good...so hopefully I can use it with better discretion next year. And I've one specific piece of advice (Now if I mentioned gender it would be all too easy) for someone I knew. Stay the hell out of my way. Or else things could get even more interesting than they already are.

      Oy, how funny...it is certainly fun to talk to people with more twigs up their asses than thought possible. But I don't like it when people put words in my mouth like so...or state the obvious by saying I have no life.  For the last three days, I've not been around here as much as I'm used to, and that I like. Today I spent watching  Grand Prix (a well-done movie from the deadly yet glamorous era of Formula 1 racing, the 60s), getting my face poked at during a dermatology appointment (some kind of minor surgery), and then being the not-so-special accompaniment to my mom's shopping. And here I am, again.   Sorry to rain on everyone's parade.

      You know, Jick, you're probably right...(smug grin)...  Well, I haven't been around here much lately, but that's partly to do with a party my parents put on yesterday...Nigerian parties are Crazy! (well, in terms of promptness)...Let's see...the party was supposed to begin at 5PM, but of course, like every Nigerian party I've ever known, it didn't really start until much later. The first person didn't show up until nearly 8PM, and then the next group didn't show up until almost 8PM...so things didn't really get going until about 10PM...Yes, five hours after the scheduled start time...Down in the basement we had a projector thing going with the Playstation...big screen multiplayer gaming is...fun, in a word. And, not surprisingly, more people continued to trickle in..the last person came in around  one in the morning . Yep. Soon after, I felt sick and lay down...until 11 in the morning. I'm told the thing ended around three, followed by a couple of hours of clean-up. Figures.  I'm looking at reviving one of the old TCS forums (  urlLink iB:: .: thoughtcrimesyndicate :. ) and re-adding it to the TCS 2.0 interface, as it's very capable and might do a better job than the current forum...I tried to create something similar on my own web account, but Lycos wasn't having it, so...that's how I wound up with this one, created almost two weeks ago. Only problem is, it seems a little slow.

      Wow.  It's been a bad day for professional sports coaches in the ATL. First, Fraser, then Kruger. AOL-TW's cleaning house again, it seems. I've got sympathy for Fraser, who coached a team of never-have-beens, also-rans, never-will-bes, and could bes for the last three years. He tried, but for how long could he have been allowed to beat a dead moose? Kruger, on the other hand...he has three all-stars to work with. Sure, they're doing okay (turnovers notwithstanding), but only when the team comes to play. His players even spoke of not having the heart to play...his own team! Despite Fraser's attempts, though, both needed to go, and at least AOL-TW waited until after Christmas to do it.  -Gee, it's quiet around here all of a sudden.  -Thus far, I've spent my afternoon: watching Episode II and downloading/copying music to my Jukebox...still got oh, 9.5 gig free, with about a hundred songs in there. At least it means I can store my "software" in it, rather than "just" music.

      I suppose I have issues. But that's obvious, isn't it?  Just got back from a Christmas party at Gabe's house...quite fun...there was an air-hockey table there, and a lot of good players, too...me, included, as I later found out...we were all outclassed by a nine-year old (so it seemed), and that was no good. We all cheated (he did too, but he wasn't as blunt about it...the wipe the rink kind of cheating), and our efforts still failed...did meet this cool girl, really cool, actually..she's from New Orleans...but...in my own best interests, I rested on my laurels...maybe I'll cross her path later on, hopefully...  I was actually funny! Didn't feel at all like myself...and yes, 'Zo is speaking, not TMK.  the 10GB jukebox is good, but in less than an hour of play, I ran down the battery...yes, an hour...but that was probably in part to making it load 45 songs every time I turned it on...so now it's charging again.  My CD drive is on the fritz...three times I tried to record songs to the PC, three times the system crashed. Two blue screens. So, to get the songs on the mp3 player, I had to Kazaa them...Can I get (yes, this is music based) a (riminy? Please?  Been meaning to update TMK+9, just haven't found time to...not in between TCS, redecorating the loft room, and NR2002, and certainly not blogging here.  Watching Episode II on the projector...or listening to it, since I'm here.

"We will not give in to blackmail," State Department spokesman Phil Reeker said Tuesday after North Korea began reopening more shuttered plants, casting aside pleas from the United States and Asian neighbors that it stop....Wait... who's blackmailing who?  I'm confused.. :rolleyes:   Spent about seven minutes generating traffic for TCS using an old traffic thing originally meant for DreamWorld...there were two; one of them I got working (worth, at best, 260 hits), the other...I need someone to manage that one...I'm out of credits and don't feel like load ing a start page every time to do so.

      Well, here's my  thoughts of a (boring) lunatic  @  1000  message...  It's been a long trip...August 26,2002 was when I started this little thing, thanks mostly in part to a Steven Levy Newsweek article. Before long, I would lament that this (blogging) should have been the basis for DreamWorld during the summer...(it would have made dream submissions easier...so basically I would wind up not having to proofread 500-word dreams from Sathya and myself...but her dreams were such a pleasure to analyze...I'm off topic, aren't I?)...Around the 1/4 mark in October, I wrote a pair of pieces for this thing, the first on our school superintendent, and the second on North Korea's nukes (long before the most recent squabble, but still relevant)...that marked the beginning of the super-hit days, and this place really hasn't been the same since.  November...well, in a brief phrase, I lost it, and I lost it for everyone to see. The troubles of losing my second-best friend for no apparent reason were wearing on me, and by mid-month I'd had enough. By the end of the month, any hopes I had for reviving that relationship were pretty much gone. My mindset has made a 180 since then, and so...I'm single and loving it...  December...two new members to this place and a little accidental publicity...the super-hits took on a "super" (how original) jump, and ...well, there hasn't been a day this month under ten hits. Three weeks ago, I would have laughed my rear off if someone said I'd have a thousand hits by Christmas, but strange things do happen, don't they?  January 2K3/Future in 2K3...hoping, as always, for some new members...Also plan on doing work on my short story blog, something I've been looking at for three months now.  That concludes my message...TCS 2.0 is complete...everything works well, except for the fact that I'll be the only one posting. Some damned glitch in the LycosUK system caused that, not my choice.

      A quick note... Congrats to Phil Olaleye on his selection to the 2003 edition of the National Honor Roll....wait? Why would I care? Well, I came across his name before I saw my own. So, in theory, congrats to me. But I don't care, really. Just an outdated mention of a guy who's completely different from the one he portrayed in the application. Just a $40 book with my name in it.  I've cooled off a bit and decided on my course of action when it comes to Lazy. I'll add those guys as members for the time being...admin access will come with time, since being an ordinary user grants them the access they need. And yes, I'm thinking aloud again. But these are my announcements within my entries, and screw the world if the world doesn't like it.   but about Lazy...don't know what happened, but there are suddenly links attached to all the articles! Like someone above was smiling and granted me that wish...now it's all good with webmate...so basically the interface is still the same, only with automated updates now part of the equation.

      Rant based on unsubstantiated evidence-  This I did not anticipate....so let me see...I explicitly say not to give the link to Lazy to anyone else, but someone either ignores my demand and gives it away, or someone else is very smart and figures out the link anyway...no idea how frustrated and disappointed I am right now...was it possible that one person thought I wouldn't find out? Well...thanks to my trusty hitbox, now I know.  So, thusly, I'm remaining the sole administrator on Lazy. Lazy is complete, but now I'm going to put off the relaunch until I figure out a better way to spread the power (now that my "authority" has been undermined)...until later...  TCS 2.0 is complete, but...

      wow...when I was born, Cyndi Lauper was number one on the US charts...makes me feel pretty old all of a sudden.  I'm actually bored...no one's online...of course, that's to be expected, but still...I can almost smell my 10GB jukebox...and that, I guess, puts me in a quandry of sorts...  Not three weeks ago, I caused a stir about people and big mp3 players (ie 10GB iPods)...and then, lo and behold, I'm a contender in the same thing. Granted, I'm not looking for 20 gigs or an iPod either, but now I'm on the darkside as well...  Rule number one in dealing with online flamers/trolls/idiots....never flame them back...that symbolizes a psychological concession, and we couldn't have that, could we?

      Well then...pretty stupid, huh? Yeah, well...I'd probably take that as a compliment, since our little (and we all mean little) friend here is merely stating the obvious. The very obvious, I might add. Ho hum. Who cares? Who cares about callow toddlers like he?  Especially when the title of this thing includes the word "lunatic."  In any case, Project Lazy is pretty much restored to its previous state. It was done yesterday, and touched up today, although with a very ineffective flash banner which was far too small to begin with (ie. it's quite pixelated).  Over the last week, this has become an update blog for a little news pub...looks good to me, considering I've managed to avoid alienating friends and pissing people off for quite a while. And, oh, 1K for this place...of course Bravenet's been dumb as magma lately (while trying to upgrade their systems, something went awry and caused everything to hiccup, and since then nothing's been the same).  It just kind of hit me...Christmas is almost here. I guess it's that cave I've been living under...need to leave it...  And a random thought, as I came across a story about a woman who was fired by her boss after being identified on a porn site...who's more guilty, the woman in the business, or the old, fat guy who actually looks at it?

      Well...in the meantime between my last post and now, I've:  decorated and cleaned the house,  revived the second Project Lazy(thus rendering the third one unnecessary),  moved all of the future TMK posts to a new site for better tracking...the link to that is  urlLink here . It's taken about 1-2 hours to get that up and running, but the design similarities between that site and this one are remarkable. Same designer, different colors, really...maybe one day I'll start alternating the designs in here...maybe...  and last and least, responded to a hotheaded post on the forum...sounded like someone thought his feelings were about to be hurt...(snicker...)  and why, oh why, is my blogging style  so  different from the norm?

      Project Lazy is nearing completion. I could probably debut it in the *.tk, but I'll hold it up until Christmas while I add in extra features. Unlike Project Lazy v1.0, this version will fully incorporate the current banners, which make the new Web-size ones optional, but still useful. It basically looks like the current site, just with a few...unfortunate..omissions...otherwise it's pretty much the same and I'll be redoind the entire site the way this one is now...  Hey, if I'm impressed with it, it must be somewhat good.  I might add a little to TMK+9 later on...we'll see.

      Well...kind of an interesting little thingy I had going there yesterday...  anyways, 'Zo and I put our heads together and we decided to scrap Project Lazy in the end...it's been replaced with, well, Project Lazy. Same codename, new project. I think this one should do much better than the most recent one, in terms of "modifiability", if such a word exists...I was all but ready to scrap Kalin's banners in favor of some web banners, and I still might, but both are now a workable feature in Project Lazy.  Since things are progressing so well, I'm going to work on it some more this afternoon.  The thing is...admins for the other guys...no. Not unless I'm given a good reason. Yes, it does sound like I'm power-hungry, and quite frankly, I don't really care. When there's problems, I need to be the boss of things...that's why I'm not doing anything with the site for now....no one goes to the site (except one Renee, who happened to be very put off by the Syndicate), so no harm, no foul.

      I had this urge to start acting like Uzo earlier in the evening. Yes, strange, isn't it? Yeah, I tried that. It was an odd feeling...similar to that sensation one gets when he learns how to ride a bike, stops for five years (as Uzo has), and then gets back on again; the feeling never went away.  What being Uzo would entail for anyone who would want to examine me:  emotionally dead ...he's a shell of an older self, and people like me, people like Sathya, people like Kalin (although not necessarily in a bad way), and others have practically dismantled him...I remember, back when I was still an abbreviation and not an ego, Uzo was a nice guy. Pretty  boring  all around, but he was still a benevolent guy, most of the time...he's also pretty dull. I guess he was never very interesting to begin with, although some people do seem to see him as a quirky, humorous kind of guy. I think he's as dull as the oldest knife in my drawer...Uzo was never really a guy for the creative stuff...once upon a time (back in 1998), before I existed, he did attempt a collaboration story....Soonaria was the title, I believe. It failed, thankfully. It gave him a chance to step back and create a better platform for his writing...people say he's a good writer, for some reason. I disagree with them...quite frankly, Uzo's not too talented with that stuff, but then again, considering my identity....  I find it hard to believe that a guy such as he could have been captured by so many demons, and become so empty without them. I shudder to think of what would have happened had I not emerged...he'd probably have made good on his suicidal urges several years ago...but then again, maybe that would have been a good thing for the world...I look at him and I see just a carrier vehicle. Like a cadaver, I suppose.  It happens. Bad things happen to good people. A bad thing happened to the 'Zo, and he's still paying the price for it...eh?  It was I who initiated the war against everyone's favorite princess, not Uzo. It was the little of his heart that remained, combined with my personality, that caused the flame-out that was last month. I pushed him towards Sathya, and then I shoved him away before things could get ugly. Thank goodness that whole deal is over with now...(unless someone wants to rekindle a month-long argument)...every time he looks at her, though, I see a great deal of pain and fear in his eyes (the actual person, though, either looks angry, poisoned, or lifeless)...but I have no sympathy for him. She's not his problem anymore. Ten wasted months of friendship  are  his problem. Funny...she went from being best friend 1-A to being his worst enemy, and then his worst nightmare. Hmm...  Sometimes 'Zo complains about not getting enough respect. I understand that, since it's usually my thing to go out and do crazy stuff for attention. At the same time, though, I do sympathize with him; it's true. He doesn't care all that much about it, but I do. It rips me to shreds, the fact that he continues to hold me down...but it's for his own good that he does it.  When I began this, it never occurred to me that I knew as much about 'Zo as I did. But then again, PrimeTime TMK should have known better.

      Hmm...looks like our newest Lunatic is also a newbie in the Syndicate...that's good...we could do with more quality staff writers, or whatever role it is he wants to play..  Speaking of the Syndicate, Project Lazy is underway...hope to have it ready by either 12-25 or 1-1-2003...I tried to implement it on the current server, but Lycos gave me a bottle of hell and forced it down my throat. Needless to say, it didn't taste well. So, I'm stuck with my second-best option.

      It's 2:15 PM....computer science Final....as we can all tell, I'm not taking it right now. I was done with it oh, a half-hour ago, and since I've been out here trying to finish my old stuff and check in on my passions.  Let's see...TMK's big news of the day....screwed on the Physics final...failed it miserably...otherwise, not a bad day. Lit was (predictably) very facile, and computer science was even easier, considering that it was entirely old tests and quizzes.  In actual news, Trent Lott steps down as incoming majority leader. As though he would have made it more than two weeks as the ML, anyway...But my biggest concern was the Millwood trade. Yes, this is the third idiotic move the Braves have made in the last two weeks. This time, the return on an All-Star pitcher is an unproven minor-league (sometime major league) catcher in Estrada. (riminy for $200000, dammit.  I did buy the Tupac CD today, so that gives me one last CD gasp before I hopefully receive my mp3 player...speaking of that, my dad's been really open with me about that. He's not been able to get far, as it pertains to the specific mp3 player that I want...gah...well, there's five days left in the countdown, so there's time, I reckon.  TCS staffers released a special edition today...one thing I'd like to know is why I'm always the last to be clued in on things around the Syndicate....in any case, I plan on doing some extensive writing, both of the TMK+9 story I began here, and maybe a little thing for TCS Online. I'll probably do a little research on the results of a nuclear war in the US for Survivors, just in case I decide to do that.

      Oh yeah...it's late night, and PrimeTime TMK's about to conclude stuff for the time being.  The hit counter's down, so I don't know if the 10+visits streak is still alive.  On my docket for tomorrow are the Physics, Literature, and Computer Science exams. The major one, math, is over with. I'll tell you what's not over yet, and that's my lyric selection.

      And what is it with people who will not let things die!?  Must be the relationship/boy-girlfriend/couple-thing, I guess. Quite an Axis they've got going.  People misread me for months about my true intentions, and when my chameleon colors showed they jumped on the first thing they saw. And me, vanquished. So now I'm drawing enemies like dead horses draw flies??  And now, it looks like someone wants to pick up a two-week-old discussion. Here's my advice: Don't. The archives are invisible now for a reason.  Appended ten minutes later: Let's see...an iPod or a class ring? Well, a class ring has intrinsic value (to me), something an iPod does not. With an iPod, all you do is listen to music. If the iPod dies, you're pretty much isht out of luck. If the ring becomes defective, it gets repaired. Free. iPods? Yeah, right. And  (riminy for $2,500,000 , give it up. I have said things people don't like. And I found out one way or another. However, only one person (well, two if you count Sathya, but she's been on this side of the fence long before 11/13) has continually reminded me of it. Not calling anyone out, but...Please, if you don't like my ice, don't hate. Or turn this into some disgusting vendetta, for that matter.

      Looks like we've been hacked. It's not the first time, and probably won't be the last.  Pissed off at the parents. Goin to a Christmas party on  Friday . Friday!!! The one thing I could ask for would be rest! And I've been denied it, thanks to my socialite dad. (riminy for $16,000, please.  Maybe everyone else has different responses, but I drew a little disdain in my remarks over my PSAT and Georgia HS writing test scores...let's see...average (1280, 96th percentile) PSAT, not-so-average writing skills score (73, translates to 730 on actual SAT if applicable). Too bad the writing skills doesn't "count." I did pick up almost 200 points overall from last year, but I need to work on stuff. I'm disappointed with a 73, though. I probably missed some idiotic answers, and also because I had a 71 last year.   Writing test :  581/600 . Not too bad.  96 th Percentile. Not 97th percentile. I suppose I did the best I could with my topic. What was our topic? If you could go back in time with your history class, to what time period would you go and why? Well, I had to be different and chose the Age of the Dinosaurs. Now I'm not going to put people to sleep and explain what I did, but I can say that I pulled out all my stops. And it worked, although not as well as I liked.  And of course, TMK's gone  bling-bling , baby! Class rings are in, and mine is well done. $214 well spent, and I don't care about what some people have to say about overcharging. Quite frankly, when I want to be iced out, I'm going to  be  iced out, thank you very much. The only complaint I might have is that it's a tad bit loose when it's all the way back on my finger.  Lesson of the past 33 days. Never put so much faith in someone (in my case, a girl), that when it's pulled out from under you that you implode and then explode. That's my lesson. Too much trust, betrayal, lashing out, backlash, recoil, nothing. That's my last month in interpersonal politics in a nutshell.

      More ucking funbelievability...  Looks like this...back when I first created the TCS beta site, it had a phpbb forum. The other web staffers hated that, because it req'd too much work or was too complicated. Consequently, I added a simpler forum (although mostly because I couldn't get anything else to work efficiently). And what now? All of a sudden I'm being criticized for having a forum that's nearly too simple!  So my advice is, Kalin, talk to the Print Publisher of TCS about it; it was his idea to alter the forums, not mine. Or, get yer own website with php capability and  do it yourself.  I'm not adding any complicated php-based forums to TCS unless the installation is easy like Saturday morning and usage is flawless like Perfection, or unless the second stage of TCS has a built-in forum. And I'd prefer not to delete posts, but those suggesting infighting within the staff gave me no choice. That's the last time I'll cross the line like that.

Observations from Fri. diatribe on love: something is amiss within me...some new, odd feeling pervades my thoughts...kind of like a thirst for vengeance, and a green wound with a salt jug hanging over it mixed together. Hmm...  2. I'm on the bus tomorrow...wonder what kind of displays of emotion we'll see...hope I don't laugh too hard...It's funny...I predicted all of this months ago, but I'm surprised it all came together so fast...well...when I die you all shall have my proof.  3. TCS is moving to a more php-bent approach, hopefully a more communal thing....so is the Future TMK...that's good for him, the girl, Kalin, Sathya/Phillip, and anyone else I've mentioned in the early going...more time to speculate, I think.

      A brief continuation....  "Then why'd you smash the poor man's glasses? Huh?" The girl moves eye to eye with TMK again. "I don't know...maybe I was pissed off," TMK responded. "Why do you care?"  The girl pushed her death-black hair over to one side of her head and shrugged. "Maybe..." she trailed off. "Maybe what?" TMK asked impatiently. "Maybe because it's people like you that are part of what's wrong with the world," she replied.  Annoyed, TMK reiterated, "Why do you care?" "Who said I did?"  TMK paused. This girl had sobered him in a hurry, but now she was making him feel very irritated.  "Look, little  chick ," TMK said pointedly. "I don't know you, where you came from, or what your goal is. Quite frankly, I don't care. If you don't answer one of those three questions in the next five seconds I'm leaving." TMK folded his arms and stepped back.  TMK sized her up again. This time he noted that she was wearing a blue v-neck t-shirt with "Boy Bands Suck" emblazoned across the front and a pair of skintight sky-blue jeans.  Very fashionable , TMK noted to himself.  I like the way she thinks.

      Oh yeah...I'll go on about hapless lovers, or love in general and my ops toward that. I'm straight like Indian hair, and...  Love is a dark, spiraling abyss. Once you fall into it, there's no turning back. Once you have it, you are instantly addicted to it. Once you lose it...well...let's just say you probably wish you never had it in the first place.  Reflecting on the last ten months is a painful process for me. I held on tightly to the edge of the cliff, and even lost half of my grip. But I pulled myself back up, and now I'm waay over on the right side of the fence. The big-pimpin, neutral side of the fence. The way I once was.  As I've said before, overt displays of affection (including but not limited to holding hands in public, kissing in public, lying on one another, "touching" in public, and pornography) disgust me. And I'm straight like Indian hair. What is it with you lovers? Is it such a powerful emotion?  And the school systems foster this stuff...Homecoming, Prom, Winter dances, etc..  Love sucks for those who don't win. Or for those that never got a chance to play their hands.

      So much for Soporific Insanity...I went through  walrus noises  (a c/o 2003 CHS blog) and quickly realized why I should not do as planned (which was to share admin access with everyone). I don't want to sound like Mussolini, but maybe absolute power is the best case in a group blog, unless the co-admin is attached to you like your red tongue. Back to walrus noises...it sure looked like Armageddon in there at times...sure seemed pretty tense. It's back to the drawing board for SI. But while I'm at it, anyone interested in joining, whenever I get it goin'?  What is it with group blogs and CHS? Feelings put down everywhere, it seems. I'm guilty of it, all of the walrus bloggers appeared to be at one point or another...and it's all close-quarters, too...you just knew you would have to deal with it eventually. A month ago, I  knew  I was raising some serious hell when I went after Sathya, but I really didn't care. Things between us had fallen apart. I just brought in the gorilla shredder to end things...However, I did not expect other people to spill my frustration before I could...but anyways...lesson in school blogs: do not blog insultingly of others at school; word usually gets around.  Speaking of CHS blogs...a whole host of them are on xanga, the lazy man's blog. Austin's got one, Jin-Hee's got one, Zac (the senior "Mad" one) has one, Raj has one, and Priyanka has one.  Xanga = lazy. Blogger rocks it up.   Blogger requires actual work to do stuff, and the prizes reaped are far greater. Xanga, however, has something blogger does not, a community system.  Haven't heard from Mr. Plans in a while, but I did see ya in Hagan's class yesterday. (Wave).  TMK's gonna check out for now. Here, have a spare (riminy.

      The weekend has arrived, hasn't it? I haven't noticed yet.  So let me get things aligned...I'm off the bus for three days and a new couple emerges? Three days? Well...things have happened faster, haven't they? Good for them. Uh...anyway...I'm deleting/archiving all the stuff that reminded me of the last ten months (in personal terms), so I won't have to deal with it any further.  Again, crappy days are the norm for me. Big deal.   Listening to: Breathless (The Corrs, 2000) on Launch.  I didn't realize how much I was itching to write something without the mental restrictor plate that yesterday's thing had. It was a rusty thing, but I guess I'll improve, since I'm going to detail the TMK+10 life for a while...I wonder what it'll be like to mention actual people I know now ten years from now and what/who they could be doing...(but I still need ideas)...  Dan refers to me as The Rock. That's hard stuff, eh? Oui. Thought so.  My quest is complete. Any plans I had for next spring have been formally cancelled.  Well, my grandmother is coming to town tomorrow. That's good news and it's also bad news. I'm not going to explain, but I could say that I get irritated easily. Very easily.  Anyway, I'm going to do a little NR2002, and work on a new TCS homepage.

      I have come face to face with my own fatal flaw. It's scary...had a idea on how best to portray myself with it built in...  TMK is twenty-five years old. It's 2013. Lost in the University of Nowhere in Wherethehellami, OH. Computer science major, psychology minor. Six feet tall. Afro. Navy-blue colored contacts. TMK-esque fashion (black denim, turtlenecks, t-shirts, all-around corporate billboard, RCR/Cingular hat from early 2004). All nice, but where is TMK now?  It's noon, and TMK's at  Joey's  drinking a Budweiser. The bar is empty, unless you count the forlorn near-dropout chick (from his Psych Hist 313) sitting at the opposite end of the bar flipping through her wavy black hair.  TMK sits there, staring off into space. He wonders what became of his apprenticeship; the memories are blurred, too much alcohol and wine.  He thinks of his lost friends, all of them. His first thoughts are of Sathya. Not much had changed between them, really, in the last ten years, probably after the Sanity Incident in mid-2003, which effectively stopped things. He hasn't heard a word from her in the last three years, and the last he ever did hear of her was something jumbled, but involving some guy named Phillip in one way or another. The thoughts drift to Kalin. He's still in-state, working for the AJC. Every once in a while his articles appear in the paper, and when they do TMK usually makes sure to drop some congrats. At last recollection, Kalin had a fiancee, but her name resides in the cloudy memory.  So it seems...all of his friends had already found someone...except him. It had been more than three years since his last normal friendship with a female, over ten years since anyone resembling a loving friend, and almost twenty since his only "girlfriend." His confidence resides at zero, his looks resemble a dead man living, and his personality resembles a robotic jackass far more than it does a human.  His career...he pauses and takes another swig.   I don't have a career!  he thought to himself.  I'm just another goddamned 25-year old burnout with loaded .22!   The bartender returns, walks up to TMK, and hands him a lengthy slip of paper. The bill. TMK pores over it, and rolls his eyes.  "You're paying me for this amount, right?" TMK says drunkenly. The bartender nods sarcastically, laughing as he retreats to his office. TMK, infuriated by the response, smacks away the beer bottle, leaving a loud BANG and a million shards of glass on the floor. The chick looks up, twirling her hair, and stares at TMK.  He stares back. Not something he's used to doing. They eye each other uneasily for several seconds, and then the girl stands and saunters over to TMK.  TMK examines her figure.  (riminy, is she pretty,  TMK thought as he peered down at her thin 5'7 frame.  "You lookin' for a fight, stranger?" She opens in a soft, yet powerful voice.  "N-n-no, don't believe so," TMK responds uneasily. The girl moves closer to him, and gazes into his eyes, causing him to step backward.  Well...I'm bored. I don't want to continue, but portraying myself nine years in the future is pretty fun. Who knows...perhaps if I survive the next eleven I'll be able to compare with this thing.

      Hapless lovers disgust me. To no end. My stomach is churning like Io, turning my face blue to green and back to green. Each time I pass them I smirk angrily in semi-disbelief, wondering how much more crazy things could possibly get on this massive, unescapable rock.  Envy? Heavens, no. Not envious at all. Jealousy?  Possibly. Jealousy is a weak disease, a debilitating one. Dangerous. More than enough for my health. Jealousy breeds greed, paranoia, discontent. Beware the dangers of jealousy.  Okay, stepping back into character, I had a crappy day. When was the last time I had a good day? Probably sometime back in July, back when days ticked off like the seconds of my iced-out watch.  Say, have any of you seen Avril  without  her makeup? Don't, unless you want to see Medusa, edition 2002.   Listening to Launch now....can't seem to get hooked up with Sheryl yet...grrr...anyways...TMK's goin back to do a little homework and a lot of chillin, if ya smell....what TMK...is cookin. (Which is a little rice, and you better not be able to smell it)

      Another ordinary day...just another ordinary day. Math test with Hagan...ugh...again. Yeah...Is there another one tomorrow? Probably. Phys...crap. Censoring myself...  Not much to say about the rest of today (I felt more quiet and withdrawn than usual), except for the fact that I did get a simple TCS discussion board (like the one JC appeared to want up on the site...here's the  urlLink link .   Today's odd quote and dialogue:  "Can I slap you now?" - Floyd, sophomore with "undisclosed" sexual preference, in reference to Kevin, a freshman "friend", but one who can't stand Floyd's presence. Kevin, "Mr. No-Nonsense," was not pleased with being whacked (more like tapped) on the back, not that I would blame him.  Well, in Lit the class read  Rappucino's Daughter , by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was an unbelievable bore through the first seven pages, it was so wordy. Half of the class was asleep, and the other half was either nodding off or not really focusing in the prelim period. At the resumption (after B lunch), more of the same. However, at some point the story drew my interest, and I raced to finish it. I recommend it to anyone who's reading. Speaking of recommendations...  Part two of notables: Anyway, after all that, I found Sathya and suggested that she have a look at the story. Of course, I couldn't give her much info at that point, so a class period later I went back to work.  Me: Perhaps I should clarify myself a little more from earlier... Pause. Me: You know that story I was telling you about, right? The short story? Sathya: Yeah... Me: The author? Nathaniel Hawthorne. -Before I could continue....- Sathya (in raised voice): I hate him!  Her outburst was so loud that it caught the attention of two passersby.  Passer: He hates you, too! (Laughter.) You kind of had to be there. Pretty good stuff, if I should say so myself.  Anyway, I'm off for now. Say, are we a group blog now, since there's 4.5 of us (Shyaam's out of the loop; he forgot he was even a member of the Boring Axis)?

I've nothing meaningful to post today, except what I posted yesterday...except for one small tidbit.I'm working on adding a Frontpage forum...err...was working on it; it failed. Miserably.  I deleted my pointless post from Sunday, but not before it found its way into the Google monster and before someone searching for Jay-Z mp3s came looking. Ooglely.   Hey, go to Shalin's website (the link is at the top left under blogs)...you won't be disappointed. If a guy's got "Plans" with a capital, I'd likely believe him.  800-ist-hier.

      Now this is interesting...seems as though I'm the only one who can't see the blog today...or was that a false statement? No tag-board, just extremely slow stuff on the site...boy am I looking at canning that malevolent SOB and replacing it with a z-board....  The BOE's decision on High Hopes was delayed today, thank heavens. My beef with the system, though, lies primarily in Dress for Success, since having four years of certain subjects would be a plus in the long run.  I was just thinking...not to sound like a real punk, but it's been quite a while since the last CHS suicide. If I recall correctly, the last one was Daniel Page (graduate), during the 2000-2001 year. And before that, Azra. That one I remember clearly, given her method. That one was very disturbing. It's always the people you never suspected that wind up committing suicide, not so much the ones that look the type. This trend in no-deaths (over the past two years) is encouraging, but I can only wonder how much longer it will hold up. I'm not saying I know someone who's at the boiling point or anything, just voicing an opinion. Liz (2002) once told us (Shyaam, Chris, Conor, me, etc.) a story on the bus during the 00-01 year about the suicide-a-year idea, which is rather self-explanatory. I guess we had a burst and now a hiatus. Good.  And the idiots around CHS should take notice. John (I know his last name, but will not disclose here), a resident sophomore, (allegedly supposed to be a junior or senior) was caught with weed during French class last week. As I was not present for the bust, much of my information is inconclusive. The story runs that he had a large stash of it in his desk at the back of the room, and had foolishly hidden it there for sometime. During class (I suppose) one day last week, he had the materials out and was (unsubstatiated rumor) smoking it during class. At this point, Ms. Peavy, the French teacher, discovers something is awry and goes to him. Of course, our stoner friend is caught blood-red handed while trying to roll up the blunt. Even today, some fragments of the weed remain in the desk. Not surprisingly, he is expected to receive his expulsion notice soon.  That's about all for today...if worst comes to worst, I'll have to replace the tag-board. I still cannot see the TCS site, even with the new content. Very, very frustrating.   And the rap artist of the year is....Nelly!  Yeah!

Browsing blogs is fun, except when they're not written in English. Or layman's German or French. There's always at least one that gets my attention. But for now, my attention resides with my Analysis book.

      I find it funny...after last week's near disaster (after all, all I said was something that had already been said before), I have a new outlook on this thing we people call blogging. Ah, but I can't say it, now can I?  It's funny, though, watching certain people throw hissies at the slightest mention of their name in anything but a meritorious sense. Who knows, maybe I'll find my way into another minefield again this week.  "You're very daring in cyberspace, Uzo." There's my line of the week. What a joke. I nearly imploded trying to keep the laughter in, it was so amusing. And then the following day, when several other people managed to be drawn into the rest of it.  That  was tres annoying.  Daring? You're kidding, right? If I'm daring, then I suppose elephants can fly. Daring is not to be confused with being out to make a point, mind you. I mean (riminy, if you think that's daring, get behind the wheel of a 750HP champcar and try and make laps at speed.  Boy, who's up next?  The WNBA. They had next (marketing slogan was "We've got next"), but now it seems as though they are next. The Starzz moved to San Antonio from Utah, the Miracle are departing Orlando, and the Miami Sol (ugh, how depressing) have folded. What else will it take for the NBA (WNBA's operators) to realize that women's basketball will never be near as popular as men's basketball? I mean no ill will towards the league at all (the Sol is tops, IMO), but it can never go mainstream if the mainstream continues to hold it down.  Anyway...I'm off for more odd tasks.

Performing TCS site updates periodically..looking for some other web tools...good to see that TCS II is on track...  On another note, the recent turn of the last month is reaching ridiculous proportions. I thought things were crazy then, now I don't even know what crazy is anymore.

      Yeah, oops. Informative  feature , not article.  I think it would be cool if there was a CHS blogring out there, so we all know who does the blog. So far I only know of about a handful of blogs, only three juniors and the rest being seniors. I was thinking, though, that maybe a group blog (this, unfortunately, is not a true group blog, yet) might be a cool idea, but it could/would only be done if at least five people wanted in and would post on a regular basis.  While on that subject, there's officially four of us here. Yeah, four? I see three. Shyaam, our nominal member, eh? Yeah, just in case we'd all forgotten about him, he's the "other guy." I'd love to say there's room for another lunatic to join us, but then again I can't exactly  say  it, can I?  Advertising pitch over.

      (riminy. I should be relieved that the weekend has begun, but I'm actually anything but. The start of the weekend also entails the load of homework, the chores, and the other unplanned things which I am not aware of yet.   However, I figured I'd stir up the pot a little before I retreat back to solitude.  Well, it looks like my quote concerning my glasses and my usefulness made it to Maya's site (see links, second down). Didn't mean to offend anyone by that, BTW. Speaking of seniors, I finally spotted Shalin. That's nice. I was kind of looking for the familiar blue hair, so I was just missing the point entirely.  There was a pep rally today, apparently, and I didn't know about it until the morning. It was relatively uneventful, unless you count Ms. Fegely's not-so-stunning defeat in our lame variation of musical chairs as something newsworthy. I feel sympathy for the seniors, having Ms. Fegely as their rep in these games. No offense against her, she's cool. However, I did notice something else, during the announcement of the teacher of the year. Ms. Macon-Gee was a popular choice, and congrats to her, although I personally do not know her. Many clapped. A certain Literature teacher, however, did not. She just kind of smiled, arms folded like paper.  With that, I'll just continue to the bus. I can say, just for starters, that it was really boring. No Kalin. No Shyaam. No Priya. And of course, per late 2002 policy, no Sathya, although she was present. That left me to ponder and scheme at the back of the bus, just watching the sophomores and our junior traitor having a blast. One odd and disturbing moment, though, when Nicole apparently tied another '05's head with a sweatshirt, nearly suffocating him. Of course, the people around him (Sathya, Michael, Nicole, Thomas, and so forth) could have done something before it got to be a problem. But no...they just kind of sat there, ogling at the man with a cloth head. (riminy. That's unfortunate, because on the next bus, it became a flame war.  Still no word on Disclosure.  I listened to a highly informative feature on suicide on  The Infinite Mind . It really gave me some pause, offered some insights I'd never considered before. My policy on that just kind of ran away to the Moon. I see it, but it's way, way, out of my grasp. In fact, I have a link to it. Ein moment, bitte, while I go looking for it...ah... urlLink here it is.   And, as I said earlier, I return now to solitude. Perhaps later I'll get to work on the TCS comics section. Perhaps.

       urlLink ajc.com | Opinion | Reader opinions    Wish I could have seen Lincoln slain  A recent letter expressed the thinking of a carpetbagger ("Don't give emblem a foothold," Nov. 28). The Union troops were not heroes; they were barbarian, conquering invaders who destroyed much of the South. All true Southerners glory in the deaths of every last one of them.  Many Americans have been brainwashed by the "great American lie" about the righteousness of the Union cause. In the same way that the American states seceded from Britain, the South wanted to freely leave the Union it freely joined. It intended no harm to the other, Northern states.  Unfortunately, a tyrant by the name of Abraham Lincoln resolved to destroy the South to keep it under his boot. Fortunately, Lincoln got what he so richly deserved. I just wish I could have been there when Lincoln got his, so I could have reached down, stuck my finger in his wound and see if I could have made him twitch.  KEITH WATKINS Atlanta   First of all, how could this even have made it to print? What a crock. No, Lincoln was not in favor of racial equality, but golly, he was  not  what this jackass has him made out to be.  This, by the way, was yesterday's paper. Today saw a conga line of people inveighing against this article and its publication in the AJC.  I'm more at a loss for words, and I'd rather not start spewing my venom around this place.

Now I have *two* open-wheel converts to root for in Winston Cup again. That counteracts the Rahal and Mo Nunn announcements of new teams in the CrapWagon (also known as IRL) League.  My day was ruined by the fact that Mother Nature wouldn't work with us students so we could have a day off. Physics test. Ugh. Math homework I hadn't done. Ugh. Possibly having a repeat day of answering doofus questions (not Abeeda-related, mind you all) about the blog. Whew.  It looks like battle lines are forming. I hate this stuff...history is repeating itself, only this time the supposed reality I considered it before is now a reality in the present. (riminy, please, for $5000.  Magnet programs only recently (today) introduced 57 new students to its super-challenging madness. This occurred at the root of it all, Kittredge, where nearly two entire classes had to be added. Why? Test results encountered delays....Allegedly many of the new students were admitted based on a second-chance lottery, of which I was once a benefactor. Yes, back in the day (1996), when I was a callow fifth-grader, I left my elem. school on...gasp...September 11...for Kittredge.   The decline of what was once one of the most prestigious programs in the Southeast continues.  Major updates to the site are about complete.  Now, I return to the depths of insanity.

      How was my day? C'etait pas mal. Oui. Really! For once.  Haven't had much to think about lately.  What is wrong with Atlanta meteorologists? I mean, it's usually like this: "A ten on the Melhuish meter today (Melhuish is our top radio guy in the ATL), sunny skies and moderate temperatures." By 3:25, however, it's a freaking monsoon outside! That was late last October.  IceJam 2002  was predicted to begin last night, but as of now, it hasn't really begun. The temps are down, but the precipitation is not. Yet.  I couldn't resist noting this little incident that took place following third period...so, Abeeda (wavey, first mention of her) and Sathya (uh...) are on the way back to Sathya's locker, engaged in some conversation. I'm on my way to my locker, but Abeeda was inadvertently blocking my way. I momentarily pause behind her, only to hear the most surprising snippet of the month:   "Hey," Abeeda said, "Have you read Uzo's blog lately?"   Surprised, I tried to back away, but no, there stood Sathya. And she'd already noticed my presence.   "Uh, he's right there," Sathya responded, half-giggling.   Abeeda turns and nearly jumps. Laughter permeates the area. I smirk in my usual manner (people say I've got a strange smirk ability), and she proceeds to ask me about something I'd said concerning Phil...(that in itself was an oddity, but I can ignore/forget that)... That was my smile of the day.   I've been told that I have this knack for just  appearing  out of nowhere...disappearing, too, but that's mostly...nevermind...  I was also called The Rock today...I wonder what happened to him...last I heard he was rumored to be Venom in Spiderman III or something...he was phased out, so I hear, of the latest WWE wrestling game. ??? I, unfortunately, do not smell....what The Rock....(lifts eyebrow, listens to the millions and millions of Rock's fans shouting his name)...is cooking. Sorry.

      Boy...I've lost a lot of time to  thoughts...  tonight...  This is not even remotely funny. This is awful. I can't go a month without pissing someone off here(even by accident)...It would truly suck if this squabble is pointlessy perpetuated throughout the week.  So, right after Nov. 14, someone monitored me to see that I got back in line. Who? My guess is as good as the next person. It's like being treated like a toddler, say something naughty and get spanked for it later.  Consequently, I've decided to  consider  altering what I post. Rather than post about school and people and run the risk of allowing Sathya/Phil/CHS vs. TMK, Round II (or something like that) to begin, I might just do the Shalin style or something. Who knows?  You know, I didn't even have anything to be mad about. I wasn't angry or anything, just making a layman's observation. I wish  I  had an iPod, but I don't need one and my parents agree with me. So to go from a 5 to a 20 simply because you filled it up kind of sticks with a lot of people. I wish people would understand that. Not angry, just a little surprised. And if I was mad, it would be crystal-clear. Regular readers of me know that.  Misinterpretations really do suck. And once again, TMK has become a victim to them.

      This I find interesting, and with it I'll have a (riminy to go for $10,000, please.  Even the disclaimer and preceding compliment had no effect, apparently.  It's funny...I did indeed learn my lesson from last month's disaster, and what did I do? I placed a disclaimer/warning on the site. Eh? Yes. and before yesterday's comments, a nice comment to hopefully offset it. But still, it seems as though whenever I say one thing about someone, whether or not it's just not very nice or just plain vitriolic, someone else has to react.  Well...I'll be happy to hammer out details here...but certainly not now.  And I'm daring, eh? I bellowed when I read that. I say what I'm thinking. Why do I keep it here? That's an obvious answer. Don't like it? Tough. The "back" button is right there, in front of you.  Of course, of all the six CHS bloggers I'm aware of (Priyanka being the newest one), I must run the hardest line when it comes to other people. Let's see, I've cost myself a redoubtable girl and then inadvertently irked another person...That's two...uh-oh...the price that comes with speaking one's mind in this medium. Even private blogs (this is not) are subject to invasion. But hey...you do what you will...  in other TMK-related news...I've edited the TCS page, totally restructured the site on the server so the *.tk thing would work properly. Also submitted to my first webring...hope all goes well...link's in the sidebar, in case anyone cares to know...

      Before I rest my eyes and cure my headaches (and sudden heartaches), I figured I'd sound off on one person who happens to ride my bus. And I'll precede it by saying that I do like the guy, but I'm still gonna pick some bones.  Let's see...he's become an Ultimate benefactor in the last month (sorry, only I would understand)...he recently declared his intentions to replace his 5 GB iPod with a bigger, far more expensive 20 GB version. I don't care a rat's candy-ass if he reads this or not...I said this before...Why replace it?  Because I've filled up my 5GB iPod,  he responds.  And besides, I'm getting a bunch of Hannukah (sp?) money and I've nothing better to spend it on...  (to that effect).  Huh?  Hey, it's called learning to erase stuff. In five weeks, he has eclipsed, in terms of music file sizes, all of my mp3 downloads (back to 1999) by a factor of five. Grateful Dead epics? So? Erase. Deal with it. I'm sure there are some songs he could deal without.  Kalin put it nicely earlier: "By the time you're 25, you're gonna be out on the street." (to that effect)...Zut, if one tosses money around like that ($400 on an iPod) because he/she has nothing better to spend it on, one will be in a lot of trouble.  Apparently money must grow on trees.  Too bad I don't have one to cultivate.

      Ugh...beware of what you don't wish for..it may come true anyway.  Nearly blown to bits over a *beta* release today...(riminy, did it feel awful. Of course I got the usual, "pretty good" for my efforts. Of course it was plain!! What, would I be able to complete a masterpiece in four hours of frantic Sunday action? Eh-eh. Rumor had it that I was seriously considering quitting as Admin. That would be a little odd, a guy who just received his first meaningful web task just quits after less than 24 hours on the job.  Well, anyway, I did as told and removed the personal plugs for now. I suspect they'll be back in some capacity later. And Phil....I did chump him a little for meddling about something he wasn't familiar with and screwing with the story to those not involved...but seriously...he's a columnist, ain't he? We're all supposed to be on the same side. Maybe I should adhere to that principle.  Uh...props to Emily, Andrew, Payal, Sathya, and anyone else I forgot on their GHP noms.

He/she cannot be deleted entirely, just fake alias after fake alias.  Speaking of Alias...Operation Peacekeeper is on tonight. Oh yeah.  And the ring of CHS bloggers grows in my mind. The problem: all the new CHS bloggers I know of are seniors. Thanks to Shalin of unwillingsuburbanite.com, I'm now quite aware of the CHS online presence. Yeah! Maybe we should all start a ring or something...

      I'll probably be home in a couple of hours so I can resave it. So you haven't been able to open either the htm file or the pub file? How evil.  I think I do remember the option of saving it as a Pub 2000 thingy. I'm not sure what exact version I have.   Anyway, when you finally get it up and running, use one of Kalin's banners and try and make it non-templated so you don't have to reformat it every issue to deal with the templation (which isn't a word.)

      Tonight's not going to count as one of my better Fridays...the comp has crashed hard twice, the second time gave me a heartstopping pause, when the initial boot checksum came up bad...considering I'd never even  seen  that screen in Windows ME before...I hit the auto-panic button in my head. I knew something was up mostly because after exiting a NR 2002 race, the system rebooted and showed busy for almost five minutes...frightened, I rebooted the system, and in one of those Alias/24-like stories, we arrive at the very beginning again.  I've been working on some Syndicate enhancements thus far and I'm really impressed with them as of now...and the Project may be done in 24 hours, depending on how much homework I do tomorrow.  Kalin and I had a nice little American foreign policy discussion on the bus earlier...a sampling from what I remember:   Kalin:"Who's the bigger threat: North Korea or Iraq?" Me:"Neither of them. The Bush Administration is."   The State of the Union was, I'm afraid, merely a passionately delivered rehashing of old facts and suspicions. There were, however, some facts I'd not heard about until then. Bush did make a pretty good case, better than what I've heard as of late.   I thought the approach on AIDS was very bold (but still not nearly enough), but it also raises one of those double-takes in US policy as the rest of the world sees it. On one hand, we (the US gov't) are everywhere in the world trying to dictate what the rest of the world should do, and many foreign powers raise the objective finger. On the other hand, we pledge billions in aid to nations, and they still want more, but offer the beckoning finger instead. If I didn't know better, I'd say we prop up (in some way) at least thirty nations in one way or another.   But we're the policemen of the world (not just the Western Hemisphere anymore), are we not?   Tsk, tsk, tsk, LeBron...  (eek)...Sun Wen's leaving the Beat....uh-oh...to concentrate on World Cup preparation with the Chinese national team.

      Oy, looks like Blogger doesn't take too kindly to sarcasm meters...  Today marks the end of the three most depressing days so far in 2003 for me. It was  marginally  better than yesterday, but only marginally so. Just really timid and tired the entire day (maybe because I got up at 4:30 to study physics and math for two hours), like I was some little ant caught in a baking oven or something.  The week is over...or is it? Considering that I'm grounded once more, it may just be a continuation...it's extremely frustrating, but this time I have to learn how to care again...that's my problem, and the parents will never understand it....  Speaking of them, they're trying to kill my newfound career aspirations. Only three days ago did I decide I wanted to try psychology, and yesterday came the warning that "I'm not going to study psychology," according to both of them...as though I'd be out of a job or something when I'm 23 and forced to sit at home reading the classifieds. (riminy...it's not like I want to be a porn star or something...  February, up next. You know what that means....Speedweeks.

High Low (Sarcasm)  I never thought the student-powered underground newsletter known as the Thought Crime Syndicate could be so fun...it's killed DreamWorld...yep. DW is no more, and the announcement will go on the site ASAP. TCS needs a Freshman bureau chief (for all the Fresh freaks out there) and a whole lot more forum members, but once it has those, TCS will challenge the sanctioned school paper for dominance. I like it. I have a surprise for the website in mind, is the point I'm making.

      Well, it's all hitting the fan, and there goes my left ear.  Today, in fact, was worse than yesterday. Far worse. As I sit here, blowing my nose and wiping my bloody lip, I wondered if there could be a day worse than the one I had last semester, and I quickly realized that it was quite possible. A poor man's chronology... 6:30 AM...wake-up...missed alarm by 25 minutes.  7 AM...leave house, miss bus.  7-8AM...drive to school, feeling miserable, completely miserable.  8AM...start of school. Return of full-fledged sickly me.  1:29 PM...the death notice...I'm toast, really, in math...don't know what to say about it.  3:28-4:38 PM...spent a second consecutive day on the bus thinking about what I was doing with my life, and whether or not I had a real interest in continuing it. (At this point, I lean towards the wrong answer, but there's always the spirited lie known as  hope).  Well, in other news...(broad CHS policy statement)  Contrary to popular belief, I have no "master plan" in place to use for Sathya, now that she's become available again. In fact, there never has been one (and people find that impossible to believe)...and it's almost funny...the end of The Couple was yesterday, in some odd (yet unsurprising) circumstances... (originally, I had no plan to say anything about it, and this will be the only mention of it)  it was somewhat liberating for me, so now we'll see what kind of colors show in the next month. Jiggaman Alan made use of my lack of a reaction (when he told me of it yesterday morning, I just kind of glossed over it, didn't believe it, really, until much later...so I had no real opinion and substituted surprise and apparently a grin, and that, I know, wasn't true...but jiggaman Alan thinks it is, and he said as much this morning. Of course, I have a feeling the other person in question now knows about this, and of course she will be furious. Well, if that's the case, so be it...no master plan, no plans at all...it's a shame...they made a nice couple, too.  Another awful day...this trend has to stop...

      Oy, what a day...sickness bites big ones, *sniff, sniff*. It didn't hit me until this morning, but by then I couldn't sit up in bed without my head bitching about it...well, it's not the flu, so I guess I'll be suffering some more at school...it was crap on the bus, though...couldn't do a thing with a level head.  TCS was unusually weak today...looks like the best thing to do would be to let jiggaman Donny come back and have us do a double-distribution tomorrow...far fewer people seemed to know about today's edition.  Someone actually called my Cingular today...too bad I never knew about it...  feeling oddly detached from my own breed today...or is it just my head again?

Spongebob Squarepants  DVD offers.  Soonaria's gone nuts...from nearly a week under a Corrupt Dictatorship to two new governments in three days. Today, I'm a NY Times Democracy. Oy, NationStates.  Not nearly as much to report on today as yesterday...had a dumbfounding quote from fellow Lunatic Shyaam about my Saturns, but I've forgotten it...sinus season is up, and I'm back to being nature's primary target. Dammit. On second thought, I defined my future (should I make it that far)...So I told myself that I'm going to try Psych as a career, crazy as I am. That means the end of computer science and architecture as contenders. So...maybe DreamWorld will come back around this summer after all...

      Oy, the Budweiser commercial (where the guy has one eye on his girl and another eye on a football game...he's not listening to the girl, but she can't tell and says he's such a good listener...and he comes out looking like the Man when he should have been the Chump...) and the MasterCard commercial (where the guy charges everything on his debit and comes home to see the Presidents (money faces) all grumpy about their state of disuse) both impressed me.  And yeah, in French...got very annoyed with Aileen over her preoccupation with being P1 in the class. I mean, she's disappointed over a 98, only because someone else has a 99. And stepped over half the class to figure out who it is with the double-nines. I remember having the same problem, albeit much less obvious and important to me, last year in French I. Except I knew who my rival was. And, seven months later, she's now a good friend of mine. (except for when she slugs me in the gut)  Why do I get the feeling I'm being monitored? ..sigh...wish it was impossible...you know, on a similar topic, I get the feeling they couldn't stand the fact that I was right and used it against me (no more predictions for me). Like I smoked em with their hands in a cookie jar. I can see it now, the red faces when TMK gets on the case. But (riminy, what was with the extra bitchy reactions? It's just a blog...but hey, couples do strange (and occasionally treacherous) things, eh? On the bright side, my continued policy of (something) will keep me from having a GF for a long, long time.  Well, once again, I've said enough for now, all pipe-dreams about Formal/Snowball dates aside.

      Xanga's not working with me now, so I'll come here.  Yeah, so much for predictions. I predicted the Raiders to win in every scenario, and in every scenario I was dead wrong. Except for the blowout one, and even then I wasn't on the right side of things.  Commercials were decent. AOL Broadband's commercial was crap (sorry, recurring story from Guys' Room). Okay, it's AOL. Exactly. The Bud Light ones (esp. the aerobics one) were good, but the Pepsi-Ozzy left me high and thirsty. Okay, maybe not high, but certainly thirsty.  IMO, though, the big story of yesterday was the   Alias   episode. Absolutely huge. Redefined the series storyline. I'm so glad I stayed up until midnight to catch the end...awesome....if you didn't watch Alias before and didn't watch last night, you missed a golden opportunity to get into the storyline. Period.  TCS had an excellent distribution today. Didn't see many people who turned down a copy today, as there were so many to go around.  I really had a lot to go on today..but I've forgotten so much of it. Layout mods later.

They're my pick for today's Super Bowl. The high-powered offense led by MVP Rich Gannon and the future Hall of Fame receivers in Rice and Brown will...overpower (ooh, big surprise there) the Tampa defense.  Final Scores (among these three) will probably be separated by a field goal...either that or it's a blowout.  Raiders 30, Bucs 21 OR  Raiders 24, Bucs 21 OR  Raiders 20, Bucs 17 OR  Raiders 30, Bucs 27....  Either way, I believe the Raiders will get it done today.

      In the next week, I'll be making some minor-major changes to this site. Things will be coming, and things will certainly be going. The first thing to go may well be the activetopic, or at least it may change its location. The right-side bar below it will have to be redone. Something else is in the works for the right side of the site...probably moving my rings over there to supplement it.  The Frozen Guy posted his Friday Five under the comments, but unfortunately the comments are no more. They're being replaced with something I remember the password to...HaloScan doesn't have that "email forgotten password" thing and signups are closed. So enetation is my new option.  Math hw is actually complete, so now I can work on the College project for Lit.  Oy, right...thing I've had sitting idling in my mind for the last two days... I'm a poor storyteller, but I'll set it up the best I can for everyone else.  The previous night, Wednesday, several schools in surrounding counties closed for today, Thursday, causing much of the student body to wonder why our county wasn't closed for school as well. We simply blamed it on JoBrown (our Superintendent of schools) and continued with business.  It's 7:40 AM when I walk into the building, last Thursday morning. All seems fine with the school, except for passing the staircase, where a strange whirring noise could be heard. Surprised, I pay it little attention and proceed down the media hall and head out looking for David (I owed him money for a CD I was purchasing) on my alternate locker hall (the other half of the Junior Hall). To my great surprise, all but a couple of the lights on the hallway are out. It would have been pitch-black had it not been for that sporadic lighting. Undeterred (if such a word exists), I go to my actual locker (where the hallway is fully lit), unload my stuff,  and then head to the media center. From there, word escapes that we're all on temporary power, which explained why merely a third of the school was lit (or the other way around)...so, on the way to class, around 8:24, the whole school caves.  Darkness. For what we hoped was long enough to have us sent home.  Fate prevailed over hope, as it usually seems to in the real world, and power was restored twenty minutes later.  Oy, and that's the Thursday power outage.

      Hmm...a wasted (for the most part) day off. Figures.  That schmuck named Schmyler continues to get in the thick of things, disrupting the flow of good feelings. I get the feeling he's on permanent PMS or something. And then, probably the same person (since the IPs were identical) went to Guys' Room and accused me of being fat, after my rant on discrimination. Loser. At least he can make himself look funny and like an idiot at the same time.  I finally did a piece for TCS, on NationStates...took up the latter half of my afternoon...it's 497 words, so...I hope it's 497  good  words, but then again, journalism is a concept I'm very green with.

      Thus far, on TMK's Unplanned Day Off, I've:  Finished (a hard-earned) 4th in a Daytona sprint session in NR 2002 season Taken about 20 photos of in-race action (one of them is about to become my new Xanga wallpaper) Resolved to try an article on TCS Not begun my math homework yet... Some accomplishments... *sarcasm*  Anyways...been doing some thinking about that Winter Formal aka Snowball...it's Feb. 8. That in itself is a problem, my willingness to go being disregarded. That's the Bud Shootout night. At Daytona. I couldn't miss it. So that leaves me with three options: One, opt for the date and tape the Shootout. Two, turn down the date and spend the 8th wondering what could have been. Or three, hope things never materialize, don't go, and watch the Shootout on the 50-incher. Right now, my heart is with option three, but my mind is at option one. That's not even saying I'll have any help; I don't know of  anyone  else that's going (and if the two people I suspect are going actually are, I'd rather not go at all), and that's what separates HC '02 from SB '03. Had I decided to go, it would  not  have been with a date (contrary to popular belief...includes the one I wound up turning down, but that is another story), certainly not the obvious female, either. In a sense, I'm glad I didn't go then, but that's going to haunt me if I go in two weeks.  And the girl's identity is...a guarded secret. I find it funny, as I said in Guys' Room, that if I refuse to divulge the identity of someone (in yesterday's case the Cingular phone, and back at HC when I killed one deal), the person apparently doesn't exist.   Similar to what happened before HC and yesterday: Privacy Intruder 1: So, who is she? Me: Can't tell you. PI One: Why? Me: Do I need a reason? PI One: Like I'd care!  (That alone is a bullshit notion teenagers give and receive, security. I've been burned several times, putting on that cloak of security, only to realize it was completely transparent)  Me: I bet you would. PI One: Why won't you tell me? I'm not going to spill the secret! Me: You would. PI One: She doesn't exist, does she? Me: She does! PI One (completely ignoring me, disappearing to go tell other people that TMK has an imaginary date): She's fake! (Laughing) Five minutes later, I'm at odds with myself for even mentioning I had something going.  Some teens don't have a damned clue about privacy. You want to handle things yourself, but the moment a peep comes out, it becomes  everyone's  business. I mean, look at the blog, in November. Uh-oh. I'm not going there, not here, anyway. Darn, if only I could password other sites. Well, I'm off to continue this later.

       urlLink This is my new Xanga , but I'm still TMK and I'm still going to be here...Xanga is simply another countermission for me.  Think I'm gonna start my own blogring...maybe one for Champ Car fans, since I don't see any...or the CHaSers ring...for CHS bloggers...who knows...  -Champ Car Roundup- Jimmy Vasser and Ryan Hunter-Reay signed on as American Team Spirit drivers today...had been rumored for an eternity, but now official...however, the team didn't announce sponsorship, like so many new Champ Car teams...that, to me, is worrisome. But Stefan Johansson (team principal and owner) claims that there is enough funding for the two car team to last the season. And now rumors of Formula One's Eddie Irvine coming to CART are resurfacing, as today he "quit" the world's premier racing series. All the better, really...

      How bout that!!! No school!!!  Yes, found out from Fleming's Xanga...I joined the dark side yesterday and hooked up with the Xanga service. It's easy to use, as Fleming said, and also pretty easy to customize. I actually like it, except for the lousy, and downright so, blogging interface. I'll get the link up soon.  So Alex was caught dealing counterfeit $20s...made with his scanner and printer, using what else but computer paper...what a loseriffic idiot. He's giving Magnets (at least former magnet students) like us a bad name...  A short entry for today...ostensibly to keep Google from anal-raping this site again. It's like a cookie monster that keeps reaching into my jar, egregiously ignoring the alarms I set.

      Today must have been the longest day of the year for me. Woke up at 4AM to study math and finish the lit project...and then actually went to school. My goodness was it dark this morning...as though time warped twelve hours ahead or something...  I think the Winter Formal invitation I got may remain just that...an invitation. I really didn't even care about it until yesterday, but...the girl claims it's a "group" thing, not a "you-and-me" thing, so...that's kind of encouraging...as a novice to such matters, I'm quite uncomfortable in this position, like a rabid porker with fleas or something. But hey, I have nearly two weeks to decide whether or not I can take another chance on the opposite sex. At least, if I do move forward, I'll do it right, so that there won't be any uncertainty or confusion afterwards...(HC02 is that painful memory...)  Blogging is putting me in a very compromising position, at least personally. So, rather than blog for twenty minutes a day, daily, I'll probably cut back to a short-form entry system here, breaking-news rants reserved for the guys' room. But this is the best spike I've had in this run, so I may not make true on that...it's just killing my time like 10-megaton ICBMs.  In the meantime, though, I  joined the BlogBoard . It's cool. Like home, almost. I love the interface, especially since it's the same as the Thought Crime Syndicate interface (TCS, btw, is due out tomorrow).  Damn, you know, someone came here from a porn site yesterday...I thought that was...odd. *as if there was a better word for it*

      Uh...some day...to-day...  That story about the freshman girl giving head to a baseball player took another turn today, when I found out that I actually know the girl. In her interests (and really to keep those of you who don't already know from finding out), I can't say her name. "Won't" is probably the better word. But here's the story...girl is caught giving head to guy, caught by his girlfriend (isn't that a shame? GF walks in on a freshman giving you pleasure)...anyway, the girl has braces and panics, biting the guy's...pleasure instrument...also, the braces, according to Flemz, got stuck on the skin, causing the guy's pleasure instrument to bleed.  Ouch.  That  is what I call a no-win situation.  Flemz is right...I'm sooo behind on online lingo, even though I shouldn't be. Oops.  Yeah...thinking I need a new name for this blog...the thought popped up at new year's, maybe for a relaunch, but I don't have a good name, other than "soporific insanity," which I've been sitting on for a long, long time now.   Is no blog safe if it's linked to mine? (riminy for...(asking price too high, inside joke)  I almost feel special. Someone asked me to the Snow Ball (our winter formal, how corny is that?! Awful...)...I was used to making fun of the name, Snow Ball, but now I may actually wind up being a part of the damn thing. And no, I'm not inventing names here. I know some of us would have to resort to that, though...:D  Jennifer Government is out today...wish I could go out and pop it.  Damn, I get the strangest search engine results... Here's my recent searches log (which, I bet, will generate even more hits)...the numbers off to the side are a result of the hitcounter's percentages and the boldfaces are the interesting ones (there were 55 of them up to now, so...do the math, schmos.)  13.   chs hot or not     22.   female news anchor weatherman 8 inches   24.   floppy not working    25.   hal bot brain download aim    26.   her sneezes  29.   im a guy who doesnt set out to scare women but ends up doing so   30.   jc boyle, blue & gold  32.   military size and russia and china and north korea   35.   priya mother board drivers download    36.   psychotic thoughts and quotes  42.   tmk's blog    oh, within the hour... nokia 6340i field test  Long night ahead...lit project and math quiz on my horizon (which is looking rather bleak at this point)...  The politics of my saying "(riminy" are now being scrutinized and questioned. What is this blog coming to? People coming here to pick sweet tidbits to use against me...people here to monitor me...people here because of boredom...?  Maybe that's just me.

      Another bored, bored day. Surfing, n2003 pre-demo demo (yeah, d-led it earlier)...three new site rings...  I should do some homework tonight (inferring that I didn't do any during the day)...and I will..   urlLink tangents  (I screwed the colons this time) is one of those supremely compelling sites the Internet continually ignores. Great design, great content (albeit a bit hard to follow at times). *stops the mindless brain slobbering and slaps self*. Yes, anyway, if you're here at this blog (and there've been quite a few of you recently), you really need to go ^^ there. And no, Tim, the author of this blog, Steph, is not boring like all the other bloggers you know. Sorry.  I finished Disclosure and posted it elsewhere, and darn, is that thing long! Maybe two pages, or more, even. It was a niceguy post, and will even get that unfair treatment so many other niceguy posts of mine get...but at least there's no message board where this thing is posted...it could be TCS...DreamWorld...GRoom..an edited archive post...who knows?

      This is me: one hand on the keyboard, another hand on the CompSci book. And maybe, if I had one, a third hand on a Newsweek looking for happy pictures.  Quoted from  urlLink .:tangents:.  (oy, those title colons can drive people nuts, although I use them as well): "I’m trying to get onto the “Blogs of Note” thing on the Blogger main page. Just to say I got on the damn thing. Lately, the blogs of note have been rather dry (well, except for ph8- whom I linked… I don’t think he knows yet, but okay)… and I’m waiting for another more journal-ish blog to pop up. It seems, though, that I have to be a Blog*Spot Pro or Plus or Premium (it starts with a p… that’s all I know) member to get on that damn list. Well, I’m cheap as hell, and I don’t think I’ll be spending money on something that already works just fine for free. So maybe I have to do some html back flips… at least I’m getting better. "  Yeah, it just seems to work that way...I did know of one site (the Homeless Guy) before it hit that Noteworthy status. They're probably all Blogger pro sites and or paid insane amounts of money to get listed.  I think I'm going to add a few more rings to the site. I never really considered Wanderlust as a ring, but I see the light now. *ow, my eyes, my eyes!*  Some schmuck got the Nr2003 pre-demo demo and posted the link to it. Unfortunately, about 2000 people are trying to download it off a college server at once instead of waiting for one person to get it and post elsewhere. Yeah. Lunacy, isn't it?

      I originally didn't plan on blogging today, and I'm still in wonder as to how I got here.  Well, someone I don't know is actually linking to me. Hope I'm good enough for her (I believe), *smirks with a pleased expression*. Yeah. Right. A reciprocal link will do, I suppose.  I had the night to cool off about doing the rant-on-someone thing of yesterday and realized how stupid that would have been. Really, really, really stupid. She's on that super-popular high (which I can say did not really exist before I met her, not saying I had anything to do with it), and anything she says may as well be holy writ compared to anything I say, which may as well be heresy.   You know you're a marked teen when you have to resort to not ever referring to a girl in question by name to avoid drawing mass derision. Yep. Thaz' me. I hope she's happy. I'm not.  The phone's real nice, I must say, except for the fact that my dad didn't ask for voicemail. That, however, is no problem. I have a phone, and a very easy to remember number.  Tomorrow...homework. I've had enough fun for this weekend.  And why in the world are we celebrating the MLK Jr. birthday nearly a week after his  actual  birthday? That makes no sense to me at all. However, it's not Trent Lott illogical, if you catch my drift...  Soonaria's getting in the middle of things as the Sea of Cecil makes rounds to depose our current UN delegate, the Commonwealth of United Sheep (Sleep) Herders. The CoUSH has been out of it, completely so, for the last 11 days, a NationStates eternity. So we're naturally electing a replacement. A permanent replacement. Jicktopia's in it, but I've already sided with the Commonwealth of Great Bight.   How's that for odd nation names? Soonaria? Jicktopia? Commonwealth of Great Bight? I love NationStates.

      I feel like chumping someone out, and I think I've got the right candidate. She meets all of my requirements and then some. She's even gotten back at me (and succeeded in telling the most believable lie I've ever heard of) for previous comments on her, long after I thought things had cooled off. (checks clock on system tray) Well, not tonight. But I'll be back for blood later. But not here, as that would be most impudent, and impudence is for the Guys Room. So, thus far, I've succeeded in getting one person out from under me. A very important person, I might add.  A pointless war on a pointless blog of pointless significance continues, and this time I happen to be the culprit of its continuation. (riminy, I love this.

      Today, my life changed. In what direction, I'll not know for a while. Today, I got a cellular phone.  Of course, it's  Cingular -sponsored....I really wouldn't have it any other way... it's a Nokia 6340i, and it's so freekin awesome!!! (it's also very difficult to use without the manual, which sits wrapped in plastic at this time)  I wanted a phone for my b-day. Didn't get it. Wanted one for X-mas. Same result. Now that I'd forgotten about wanting one, I get it...Whooeee....  It was part of a general plot by my parents to replace my mom's [deceased] cell phone. It just happened that my dad got a special deal on mine, a Nokia, and hooked me up. The parents got hooked up with some super-bling-bling phones, Motorolas (Hooray to Motorola for not sponsoring Michael Andretti in IRL IndyCar and sticking with CART as official two-way sponsor), and saved about $200 on the pair.  Weekend: Redefined.

      It's surprising to me that nobody has noticed (or cared) that ESPN's "super" cams for its football contests are actually rip-offs of the old XFL stuff. You know, the field level cameras, the swingline things. XFL had a ton of that stuff, but it was the XFL, and so it naturally wasn't done right. Two years later, ESPN copies it and makes it look like they were grand innovators in TV production. Smashing (riminy, please.  Things are starting to heat up in NationStates. Our region is preparing to depose our UN delegate (On a related note, I joined the UN yesterday) and insert a replacement. And the server! It's fast! Like the rest of the Internet!  School consolidations? (Kalin, this includes Livsey, if that means anything to you or your sister)  I wish we could have the Clayton Co. board of education...remember how they suddenly canned their Super? And even when they had to rescind the order, they suspended him. Now if we could do that for ol' JoBrown...in a word, "Sweet."

      This is actually the second time I've blogged today, and I'm still not home yet. The first was a wasted effort at Henderson, when I panicked and inadvertently closed the window, killing a page's worth of text. Yeah, (riminy...  But I've got it hooked up for round two. I did a little thingy on interpersonal politics, also known as i-p-c to me, around the school, but it was so longwinded that I don't feel like doing it over.  For all the IndyCar Series' banter about having more cars than the CART Champ Cars, it appears CART's CCWS will even have more, despite the rampant rumors of the offseason pointing otherwise. If it wasn't about CCWS teams moving to IndyCar, it was CCWS teams shutting down. Drivers out of rides, drivers pricing themselves out of competition, or drivers not able to bring sponsor dollars. All of this, a result of the let's-screw-CART media view, has taken it's toll. But CCWS is here, in just over a month.  Speaking of motorsports, the January tests at Daytona are over. Which means...less than three weeks until Speedweeks! This offseason seemed so short this year, but I'm not complaining. The longer Tony Stewart isn't the Winston Cup champ, the better. The Champ Car season begins a week after Daytona, in St. Pete.  It's the weekend?  Oh yeah, AP Psych is in for next year. So far, I'm assembling my list of people who I know have signed up for it, and that stands at seven or so. Including my DreamWorld teammate. Okay,  former  DW teammate, Sathya. And who knows, this may facilitate my closing down of Site Two. Selfish, yes, necessary, yes. Well, maybe. Or maybe it'll just be her stuff. Nah. As much mutual hostility as there is at this point, involving the DW site would be like adding...well...no further comment.  I finally came up with the inspiration for redoing TMK+9, and from the strangest of places: The guys room. It came when I heard this girl torch another, while I was washing my hands. The girl said something to the tune of, "Oh, so I'm not cool enough for you to say 'hi' to me anymore?" and stomed off, apparently. The other girl, the one listening, was confused. "I didn't hear you," she apologized, apparently running off after the first girl.   They were probably sophomores.  In any case, I'll be at work today and tomorrow, hopefully, redoing TMK+9 with a new title and theme. It should be good, I hope. It may be like the Unwilling Suburbanite blog, it may not be.  But first, I'd like to enjoy my Frigid Friday Night, if you don't mind.

      Tired.  So...another day, another supposed ice storm...people like Julia up north must be laughing their bottoms off, watching us Georgians (sounds wrong, but is actually correct, the "us") freeze and then hope for snow like crazy.  So...AP forms due tomorrow...I've filled out the form with five, effectively signing my death notice/ suicide note for later in 2003. Or so it seems. I couldn't imagine what Sathya would be thinking, although it certainly wouldn't be what I might be.  From academic "unknown" to Two-time NHR guy? Yep. Twice. Consecutive. This time, I don't think I'll order the book. My problem and chronic sore spot is the lack of community service. It's not that I don't like serving the community, just that I'm never up to the task.  French club t-shirts are reaching production. In-house production, that is. I really don't care much for the design, which is just a little WordArt superimposed over an Eiffel Tower. It's not bad, but it really could be better. Don't get me wrong; Dan's a great guy, but that shirt design could use some work.  I just installed the AwayBox, which generates away messages on the fly and has a built-in alarm clock, all coded as an AIM expression. It's great, except it seems to have a mind of its own at times (rapidly changing away messages, person-specific announcements going off at odd times, etc.). Or was I just hearing things? Hopefully the former.  Single-handedly defeated the rest of French class in a sprint-sentence contest. Thirteen to twelve, me over Aileen. Some show, considering it was five minutes long. That was my lone highlight of the day.  Why it's important to not trust fire-drill innuendo...upon hearing a rumor from a teacher that there would be a fire drill today, I made rounds to go tell the one person I cared enough about to tell. I was kind of surprised she thanked me for the warning, which later turned out to be a false one. It was rather embarassing, having to apologize for false insider info, but that's a  triviality  in my day.  Got a letter yesterday from my new #1 contender on the college list, UGA...some presentation on the 21st (Feb), but I doubt I'll be able to go.  CART announced that two races, the Cleveland "airport" race and the Milwaukee Mile oval, will be at night this year. Sweet.

      Today is CART Day, the way I see it. CART unveiled the new logo for the Champ Car World Series (which is underneath the shoutbox and slightly compressed) and announced Craig Pollock's new team, PK Racing (don't think that has anything to do with Priya :D). Accordingly, I've altered my screen name to (see profile below my MediaList, whenever I post it).  In other words, I've made some minor changes to the site (namely removing the bulky AIM remote and adding the CCWS link in its place).  Today is also Aileen's birthday. Someone else jumps ahead of me in the age bracket. gah...  AP forms due Friday...Right now I'm looking at five: Psych, Government, Lit, ESci, and Calc...completed by Economics/Sociology (if possible), French III, and Creative Writing (probably the Big Mistake in the eight). Four/five seems like I'd be stretching myself thin, but don't tell that to Sathya. She's beaten the AP sheet to shreds, she's got so many. Seven.  Seven, dammit. Isn't that a bit of a back-breaker? I know she's a strong gal, but is anyone that strong? Maybe she still deserves the "Super" title once revoked.  I loathe cars, unless they're 3400 lb. Winston Cup cars or nimble, dynamic Champ Cars, or even the ones I drive on the PC. Now I have a problem. Before I can get a driver's license now, I must pass a live-action test. Great. Knowing me, I'll probably total the test car and then be sued by the other car driver for Lunatic driving. But first things (learner's permit) first...  Kittredge (former alum I am) is even stooping to kiss JoBrown's derrier. The offer? Kids can get out of their uniforms for one day if they pay a dollar to the Red Cross. Hats and sunglasses I can understand, but getting out of the uniforms? Such a measure simply guarantees that the kids will hate the unis at least as much as they already do. Surely some parent will complain, right? Source: Yahoo! NoUniforms group.  Mercifully, TMK+9 is being repurposed. I really think this (online blogging) is the wrong medium in which to conduct my writings (although it is much easier to use), and I'll probably be better off that way. So, as soon as I clean house, TMK+9 becomes the satellite blog to this one, for the stuff lesser in meaning.  Fleming was right. Youbetcha there's a bit of tension. I think this thing, although blown over for now, is still a smoking gun as long as I have fingers to type with. JC was also right...the thing about looking at playing the most obvious card to get back at me is certainly logical. And also unforgivable. The circles of life have strange ways of reversing themselves, it seems.   Wal-Mart needs to be boycotted.  Why?  urlLink This  is why. It cannot be tolerated. Period. Read an alarming article on Chinese illegals in New York contributing to Wal-Mart sales indirectly, through the sweatshops. That was Time, (my b-day, November 2) 1998. Even now, the problem rages on.  I hate Trig. Hate it, hate it, hate it.

      Oy, what a day. It sucked.  Yesterday's entry kind of affected me. Instead of seeing things in 16 million colors, things quickly dimmed to gray and then to black and white. That's kind of how the mind is, perpetually changing (unless you're dead). One minute you're ecstatic, the next, suicidal. Or maybe that's just me. It's an interesting phenomenon, the human (or almost-human) mind.  Advanced Placement apps are out today, catching me by surprise. Thus far, the only things set in stone for me as plans are AP Psychology, AP Government and Creative Writing. That, of course, leaves me with five classes to work with. Can anyone say "Fernbank Independent Study?" I'm about to.  Again, as was the case with Friday, business as usual...  Someone's remark in an AIM profile prompted me to counter with an equally as insulting remark: Girlfriends are like garbage; you have to take them out twice a week. (Unless you have a housecleaner, of course, which is the equivalent of a cellular phone) I'll remain single, thank you.  Before the start of last week, I had nothing against the Philadelphia Eagles or their fans. That was, until I began to hear about those damned fans. The football fans in Philly look like idiots caught in a radiation storm. So short, odd facial features. Go up their with a jersey other than an Eagles one and stir it up. You'll come home in a blue bag, assuming they (the fans, probably in the upper decks) didn't castrate you beforehand or something like that. Well, I know who I'm not rooting for next year (for this weekend's NFC Title game I can make an exception)...  Suicide-bombed a math quiz today. It hurt all the more considering that I knew it was coming, and simply forgot to study a crucial page. At least there's tomorrow.

      I nearly swallowed a bullet today, while eating some chicken. How the bullet found its way into my meal is beyond me, but at least I didn't crack a tooth or anything. Funny, how so much of the strange stuff happens to me...  Woke up this morning. Really didn't want to go out, but of course I had to. As I sat at my bed, I began to realize what a hellish, meaningless life I was living.   I mean, let's see...(in address to myself)...You have a blog, which seems to mean more to you than your social and academic life at times. You have used this blog to ultimately destroy the best relationship you ever had. You claim that a couple you know is somewhat out to punish you for past comments you made on this "blog." You post quizzes on the site that are absolutely meaningless to anyone, including yourself, as though it's some social thing. Your own tests prove that (1/1/2003 or so) you are in serious danger of losing what little sanity you have left. Your life is based around one thing, the computer. Anything else is really a hassle. You complain that your computer understands you more than your human counterparts, and you spend time spilling personal thoughts that otherwise have no business being outside of your head on a blog in which anyone that can think and read can misinterpret you and consequently mock you. You claimed (this is waay in the past) that you still love some girl as a friend, when all outside evidence claims that you either: love her as more than a friend, or you hate her because you're on the other side of love. However, we all know the answer (or at least I do), that you loved her as a friend, and then when the meet-you-halfway friendship started to fall apart, you fell apart as well. Not only did you fall apart, you imploded, resulting in a very hostile end to that same friendship. And now that your former friend has done well to nearly vanquish you, your hatred of the concept of love and affection is starting to poison all of your other thoughts. Lastly, you claim that you're in the process of reevaluating your life and your priorities.  Well, what do you have to say for yourself?

       Thonk!  The upright sounded as the football bounced off it, and fell harmlessly to the ground. That's from the Falcons-Eagles game. So far, I'm glad I didn't mention it or make any picks for the game.  There's a funny funk going through this blog. I smell the dirty air of love, a badly corrupted vendetta, and a few extra faces that don't need to be part of this. Then again, I've been under the weather for the past day. It appears that in this latest matchup of passions, I have all the drafting help. For once, something I said did not pit me against ALL of my closest friends.  You know, speaking of ol' Phil...I never claimed to dislike the guy, not when I criticized his iPod decisions. My stance didn't waver when he came in here with the snide comment about my C/o 2K4 ring. And even now, it doesn't waver in the face of his girlfriend's (misunderstood and mostly false) accusations that were tantamount to calling me a stalker...however, it seems that whenever he visits (the only way I can tell is through inferential thinking, phrase of the week, and a capable referrer listing), there always seems to be a rattled (and usually unimpressed) TMK left in his wake. Some blogs are built for certain people.  This blog is not built for him, nor is it for his girlfriend. Of course, I mean that in a non-insulting manner, but people will inevitably misunderstand that and turn it on me, even though I'm being as honest as I should be.  I tried to start up a Slashdot style site to at least compliment this place (ie lists, lyrics, and quizzes), but the approval process is taking forever. It it goes on any longer, I may just run it up with TCS and see what gives.  Still missing my speccies, so it seems that I'm always a little sleepy. At least I'm thinking straight.  I was thinking about Disclosure again, and reopened myself to the concept. I realize there's still a ton of business still left to finish. (And for me it will only get worse, as my Syndicate Online crew members/allies are out of town, leaving me completely defenseless to  the  couple). The best I can do is to avoid them at all costs, and hope they will reciprocate.   Round two of The Couple versus TMK versus this blog appears to be slowing down, but the damage has already been done.

       , Saturday edition.  January 10, 2003  1. Where are you right now? Hey, yo. That's a tough one. I'm at the computer.  2. What time is it? 1 PM  3. What are you wearing? An Allentown, PA sweatshirt and adidas joggers.  4. Any people or animals around you? Describe them. None, except me, myself, and I.  5. What are your plans for the weekend? Hopefully: to fix my specs, memorize stuff for math, study phys, and get Soporific Insanity up and running.

      w00t. It's Friday.  Again, my specs finally came undone. And so, once again, I'm more useless than a pair of tits on a nun. Except this time, I may be able to get it all fixed in the next week...may be heading up to Northlake "tomorrah" to see what can be done for the glasses that have come to define me over the last 1.2 years.  Finally figured out what the crap l337 means. Unfortunately, I'm not. Yet. After this, though, I don't plan on speaking under the x0r suffix ever again. It's ghey as buttcrack.  No time for the ghey concept known as Disclosure. Earlier, I saidx0r I'd postponed it, but now, my response is  Stfu and go away.  Which leaves me with Plan B. I'm something of a trendwhore when it comes to blogs, so...I'm going to playx0r my part. To the point, I'm going to do one of those about-me things everyone else seems to have. And, sooner or later, I'll restart the lyrics blog I had.  I remember one point in time (maybe two months ago) when I went on a lyric frenzy. The thing with people posting lyrics, I thinkx0r, is the idea that the lyrics say what that blogger cannot.

      Gosh.  I thought this was over five hours ago. But my hunch about the shooting war was right. Again. This is the third time I've provoked her boyfriend. The third time!  Quite frankly, he's not correct. In only the most needle-thin circumstances can I really deduce someone's identity as he /she visits the site. I wouldn't know if the guy in question visited, although tonight it's obvious.  It's cute, the stand up and defend your girlfriend line, but one must draw a line where the crazy logic is. Anyone with a website (as I said below) that has even a modicum of popularity probably would want to know where his visitors are coming from. Couple that with  inferential thinking  and you've got the mess I'm in. I didn't insult her personally, but the vitriolic response the rant inevitably generated sure made me double-check my words.  Tomorrow...business as usual. That was my policy until some gloves were tossed in my direction earlier today. That's my policy for tomorrow. The only people who bring it up will be...them (the couple). Or anyone else who heard the tall tale.  Business as usual, got it? Damn good.   Tomorrow...Disclosure. Final. All questions answered, once and for all.  (RIMINY FOR $25,000,000,000. This a demand.

      Personally, I don't think there's anything odd about looking at the IPs of people that visit you. If you learn to recognize them, no harm, no foul. I had a HitBox counter thing when I had a website in 7th grade and all the trackings  are  addictive to follow. With a site as popular as yours (1200 visitors?) it's probably more interesting. I think people are trying to criticize you as to other things you've said about that situation (with above unmentioned people) and IP recognition suits their needs.  Oh, and apparently Ms Finke likes the paper. So that's sufficiently freaky.

       Re: previous post.  Good. If the Administrators don't see it as a threat, great. Glad to hear about the progress on TCS VI.  I probably should be happy. I probably should be furious. Instead, I'm simply disgusted.  Why I should be happy: -Got to feast my eyes on the writing test score again -Salvaged a B from math exams, gaining three points in the final week of class -Salvaged an A from CSci, after being down 2.5 points just to get within range coming into Finals.  Why I should be furious: -It can never help to be accused of being an Internet stalker by a former friend, heard through the word-of-mouth vehicle. So, (identities and times protected), it's the middle of the afternoon...and one girl and this guy are talking in class. The guy kind of rouses my attention with, "Isn't that right, (me)?"  Surprised by the interruption (I was reading), I turn around to ask about what it was. And then I hear it from the girl, that I allegedly was tracking the IP address of one individual whose identity I've sidestepped mentioning directly for a while. A brusque "No" was my response to whether or not it was true, followed by a brief discussion about it. Surprised by the allegations, I asked her just who said that. The answer stopped me cold.   The answer is obvious (if you read this thing regularly).    The logic behind hers is anything but. Of course, I made it a point to stay as far away from her the rest of the day, completely disgusted with her idea...and at least she wasn't on the bus, either (that could have been interesting). She wasn't, but her boyfriend was. How exactly I let this cat out of the bag is vague to me, but I let it out.  And of course, no one sided with me, since she has all the power around there. I never fully got a chance to answer the question, "Do I track IPs (specifically hers) on any of my websites?"  No. Hell no. Only stalkers do that. She's the last person I'd want to stalk.  However, as anyone who runs a website for visitors knows, it is certainly important to know where one's visitors come from. I'm no different. Time has helped me deduce the codes that are my visitors. ISP...referrer (where you came from)...entry page, exit page, how long you stayed at the site...and of course, the IPs. Some, like Kalin's, are really quite obvious. Others (my regular customers) are much harder to distinguish...and then, hers.   Well, considering that the person in question uses the AOhelL service...anyone who does the hit tracking knows AOL visitors are nearly impossible to track. IPs change at every turn (not talking static IPs), making it damn near impossible for anyone to do any kind of tracking. So, (in the business of trying to discern how one's visitors get to the site) the second step is to track the referrers. After that, the rest is  inferential thinking . Not hacking, especially not stalking. Interpersonal politics also has a hand in that, but there's no need to elaborate there. My knack for being right about such things is the chief factor in this hush-hush problem.  Now, about the afternoon. Her boyfriend, in the "She can do no wrong" state of mind, cut me off before I could counter. A key point Kalin made (which related directly to inferential thinking) pretty much nailed my coffin shut, effectively ending the discussion with the egg in my spectacles. Well, that's his (not Kalin) damned problem. No,  their  damned problem. No, it's my problem, too. How would you like to be accused of being a stalker?  And the biggest problem is, it all boils down to my words versus hers. (riminy, it seems like the tables are turning again. Once more, on me. And that's...the end of my rant. The more things change, the more others stay unchanged. Like the concept that I'll wind up starting another verbal war for this.  Now, for a lighter mention of things, I'm going to do something more informative for the weekend.   Soonaria  update...Corporate Police State, from Iron Fist Consumerists. I like it, but the economy's got too much power over the Soonarian government. I need to change it. No, Soonar (Soonarian premier) needs to change it.

      I got some of the same reactions for TCS. It's a little hard to get righteously indignant about the school's administration while you're on holiday, which is why Issue III was probably our most popular, being that that was the week I got in trouble for wearing a t-shirt. Personally, I think we're steadily improving in the technical and visual aspects of the paper. We've rounded up people to do art (Kalin did a political cartoon that unfortunately couldn't run due to news developments that rendered it obsolete, Shyaam has a cartoon for Issue VI, Sasha's volunteered to do artwork...) so we won't look as bland. More people on the staff of the Blue and Gold are signing up, meaning more training in newswriting, and so on. Layout was better this issue, if only because of the extra time.  If you (meaning Uzo, or, in fact, anyone else reading) want to write something, it may not run until Issue VII, as, surprisingly, VI is already full. So time'll be on your side as well. Fortunately for the unkempt masses, there are some strong comedic pieces in this issue (by Chaplain Limp Showing and Mad Darius) as well as "policy tracts bloated with the weight of statistics" to keep us properly respectable. Ms Finke is reading it now, thanks to some teachers who approve of it, but that hasn't proved evil yet, and I won't let it affect what goes in the paper.  And the such. The new layout of the site is great. Vote in the poll. Remember what the dormouse said.

      Good. We're back on the air. Actually,  I'm  back on the screen, if we're going to be sticklers for protocol.  Finally getting a chance to catch my breath...let's see...TCS 5 is out...judging by a few reactions, it's not as "good" as some are used to. Well, I see it as being a more polished edition than in the past. Funny, that the editions with almost two weeks for prep are less popular than the ones done in six hours. The lead article had to be among the best I've ever seen, but then again, it's not as bad as I make it out to be. The key is to go old-school, if there is such a concept. Return to what works. Comedy. That was a complaint from this edition. But hey, I don't make the decisions. I execute them.  (In that little blurb about doing what we all do best, I see parallels to this thing, as well.)  TMK+9 is coming along. To think that it wasn't even my idea. It was Julia's. Julia, who I've not spoken to at all in a very, very long time, suggested the idea the first time our paths crossed. At first, I half-took the suggestion. But then, as other things started to press down on me, I realized she had an awesome idea going. And here I am...creating a fictional self, fictional characters, and mixing them with existing people...lunacy, that's what I call it...but hey,  lunacy works!   It didn't occur to me that, when I had the flu, I nearly killed myself, going the stomach way. Let's see...early October, Saturday night...Papa John's pizza. Four slices for me. Morning. Highly acidic mix, first thing. By 3PM, it's on...can't do math homework, barf during the Talladega race ( I remember that because Robby led twenty laps, only to have NBC completely ignore him)...and so began the onset of the flu, and two days out of school. Of course, since I'm either like a shadow or I'm unworthy of notice, barely anyone noticed I was gone. That kind of thing didn't surprise me one bit.  What did surprise me, though, was my discovery of a caterpillar (a small one) crawling on my French book during class. I was half asleep (as usual) when I felt something disturb my hand. Rattled, I glanced at my finger and noticed this white thing on it. I shook it off the book and my person, leaving it to determine its own fate. (It's probably dead)  I feel sorry for Mrs. Hagan's kid. I didn't know that he was the kid until the twins told me in the media center. Most of them didn't even notice his presence yesterday...must be an interesting life, being Mrs. Hagan's kid.  I didn't even notice until earlier (a sidenote kind of thing), but I got my 1K+200th visitor (not hit; in that category, I'm way above 2K)...nice...  I just blogrolled Kalin's new site, the Mac Shac. I despise the content, being the hardline PC guy that I am, but he deserves a hand for the site design. (heers...  The TCS forums are pissing me off. The posts just disappeared from the front page! So now we have to go back and post new stuff again...(riminy for $697.  I can now officially declare the personal relations of Jan-Aug. 2002 a write-off. There's no point, really, in trying to salvage anything. TMK would like a war, but I'm not having one. At the same time, there cannot be a truce. Never. Someone asked me, "How are things going {with YKW]?" I responded brusquely, "They aren't." She got the point.

When you're here, lunatic is a good thing. When you're in her class, lunatic is "What the hell is she thinking?"  Oy, the homework...(riminy...

I'm calling it the People's Republic of Soonaria, so I need to make a flag to displace the one I've got now...Although I fit a Green profile, I may as well have done a 120 and picked the hard line I've got.

      Anyhow, I don't think teens should be worried about that (the previous two entries) just yet.  I feel rather deflated about my effort now, since I'm starting to discover the holes in it (some of them were placed on purpose, some were accidental), and I'd rather give it up now. Funny, once someone gives this guy the notion he's a decent writer, someone/something else comes along and neutralizes things. It's a perpetual cycle, dammit.  I'm looking into the  urlLink NationStates  thing, but the link seems down, only two hours after my first visit. Oh well. I think, though, that the only way I'd do it is if I had others doing it with me (like Diplomacy)...but anything is possible....  As evidenced by the Falcons' stunning win over the Packers.

      Well, I do have one amendment to make on that...there's actually about four million Chinese troops, not the .37 billion number I tossed out. In theory, there are .37 billion available for the army, but of course they're not in regular duty, much like the draft over here (70 million by the same token)...so there, another concession.

      Not much business conducted on the web today, save for a good bit of research on North Korea and China. Did a small post on the TCS forum (I'll wind up blogrolling it soon)...Still no response on either of the web directories, so basically I'm carrying sponsorship without any real back up (in motorsport terms).  OState took care of business, didn't they? Well, so are the Falcons. They're leading big right now, but of course, this is Green Bay. Look for the Falcons to win a close one or lose an even closer one in the next two hours. Vick is doing his thing, but you have to wonder about the Kryptonite lurking near that majestic No. 7 jersey. I find myself pausing just to make sure our star QB gets up quickly, but it's cool up to now.  I got an email this morning from someone who had stumbled across the "opinion piece" I did on North Korea (10/02, no longer linked to from here but still in the archives). He (probably) thought enough of the thing to send me a lengthy e-mail correcting my rant. While I did appreciate the contact, I prepared a counter. I'm hoping I can tune it up a little for TCS VI (if possible), but for now it remains a counterpiece.   Here's the original e-mail sent to me:  Okay let me first say that you should list your sources on where you come up  with numbers and military capabilities.  Korea does not have 200 - 300  aircraft.  They have 1,139 aircraft and 283 Helicopters.  Furthermore, they  have 3,400 heavy tanks and 2,200 light armored vehicles.  Now this does not begin to compare to the 11,189 Airplanes, and 7,925  Helicopters that the United States has.  Not to mention our 10,900 Heavy Tanks  and 32,545 light armored vehicles.  Oh and...let us not leave out the Navy.  We  have 239 Warships to North Koreas.  Now...you want to talk about who has the largest military in the world...that  depends on what you classify as largest.  If you go in terms of spending...  then the USA has it hands down.  North Korea is expected to spend only 1.3  Billion USD in FY2003 compared to China's 42.0 Billion USD.  How about the USA?  We are expected to top 396.1 Billion USD in FY2003...nearly more than the rest  of the world combined, including Russia who is spending 60.0 Billion.  Hand to hand combat is a thing of the past my friend, and so I can only assume  you refer to China as the largest Military because of their population.   Numbers are not NEARLY as important as they used to be.  A company of US  Marines could easily take out Chinese troups with a kill ratio of 30:1.  In  addition, China has only 4.2 Million "trained" soldiers compared to USA 3.5  Million.  Now that may be more, but let us look at actual Military capabilities.  China: Heavy Tanks = 8,250 (USA = 10,900) LAVs = 4,500 (USA = 32,545) Aircraft = 6,100 (USA = 11,189) Helicopters = 513 (USA = 7,925) Warships = 117(USA = 239) Budget = 42 Billion (USA = 396.1 Billion) Troops = 4,130,000 (USA = 3,592,000)  So please explain to me why you think North Korea is not a threat (their budget  may be small, and their soldiers poorly trained, but there are 3,000,000 of  them, and they have anti-personnel nuclear weapons even if only 3 or 4 of them)  and why you think China has the worlds largest military (when clearly the USA  is by all accounts the largest.)  Sources: IISS, DOD, CIA (check out their websites)   And here is my counterpiece, in somewhat edited form.   North Korea-                According to a recent ABCNEWS article, North Korea does not possess either number we have come up with in terms of aircraft. I will concede that my numbers may be off somewhat, but yours are as well. According to a Federation of American Scientists article, North Korea has 760 jets and about 82 bombers. The ABCNEWS article claims North Korea has 600 jets.               This may seem like pocket change compared to the United States, but that’s only the beginning, as you pointed out earlier. The lion’s share of these jets are antiquated, consisting of Korean War-era aircraft. However, they do possess roughly sixty modern combat jets (MiG 23 and 29, but I wouldn’t quite consider the MiG 23s as modern). North Korea, as you may know, does not produce its own aircraft, and instead relies on Russia and China for its supply. (On a related note, China also depends on Russia, but is modernizing quickly to close the gap.)              As it relates to military size, North Korea is in the top five, according to my sources (ABCNEWS and the US Army-Korea website). ABCNEWS lists Korea as having the third largest military in the world, with 317,000 tanks and 10,000 artillery pieces along with the 600 jets. The US Army website lists Korea as the fifth largest. Although the exact total is unimportant, one should also consider the actual equipment used by the Korean ground forces. Much of the equipment, despite modernization efforts in each of the last three decades, is still based on 1940s and 1950s Soviet designs. That doesn’t strike me as being a threat.              Your total for Korea’s army is unusual. Three million? Is that the eligible amount? Or is that the actual amount of soldiers? I’ve read that Korea’s totals are around 996,000 (1999 reference), down from 1.1 million in 1992.               North Korea is a threat to two main groups at this point, South Korea, and the US troops stationed at the DMZ. The small warheads North Korea does have may be a threat to the DMZ, but Korea is certainly not a threat to the mainland USA. Yet. What few nuclear warheads they have are not capable of reaching the US via ICBMs, although a longer-range missile is in development. What’s more, the North Korean people are starving. The government is more and more dependent on external support, and I think because of that the possibility of Korean aggression is minimal.               Furthermore, I believe that North Korea has little to lose by restarting its nuclear program; the government is already a pariah in the international community. Regardless of how long the fuel shipments and such are withheld, North Koreans will still starve. Since the government wants to play hardball, so be it. We’ll see what gives. The American media machine has, in six months, turned North Korea (as a country) into a group of bad, bad people in need of a spanking without saying that North Korea is nearly harmless against most countries except South Korea.   China-              My apologies. I’ve forgotten my source on China’s military size, but I believe China’s military is still the world’s largest. The policy of China’s military appears, however, to be quantity over quality. There are 370,087,489 (CIA factbook) eligible troops, not necessarily battle-trained. I believe your stats on China’s army are correct, but the Chinese military is modernizing its forces, proven by its recent purchase of Su-27 aircraft and SA-10 missiles from Russia. As for the American military, it is still unquestionably the world’s most expensive and best, despite the downsizing of the past decade. In terms of soldiers, no, it isn’t the largest. According to an April total from the DoD almanac, the US has only 1.3 million soldiers. Foot soldiers are already obsolete, as evidenced by the new wave in American technology, but that is where my point lay. That said, I’d concede your point on China.

Do you have any piercings? If so, where? Nope.  4. Do you have any tattoos? If so, where? Fake tattoos, yes. They're long departed to oblivion, courtesy of H2O.  5. What are your plans for the weekend? Probably to study for back-to-school and to chill some more...do some sim racing and some writing...and of course, update this blog.

      I figured I'd do a little reworking of the layout and sign up with a couple more cool sites and so forth.   That was an odd thing to say, considering I've said it before.  Is it an upset (wow, I first typed update!) in the works? I'm "watching" the Fiesta Bowl, and OState's doing surprisingly well against Miami. This is one of those rare games in which I don't give a living (riminy about the outcome. Really don't have a problem with either team being there (UGA's probably better than OState, but then again UGA couldn't beat Floridacrapola.). At least Florida, Tennessee, and Florida State aren't there instead.  I actually fired off an e-mail at Sathya, even though I really have no business doing so...in a paranoid person's world, it could possibly be seen as "interfering" in someone else's relationship...but hey, what better thing to get in the middle of than this one? That couple has to be  the  joke of late last year and this year. The undercurrent they don't know about continues to swirl, but (luckily for them) it's not picking up steam. And considering my hand in accelerating things...the picture becomes clear to me.

Someone came through here asking for "her sneezes". That's a good thing. Why? My odd reference to Daniella's nose is in the archives. That's the first time I've seen someone in the archives before...(usually google would just link to the mainpage)...

      How bout' them Dawgs!  It was a surprisingly good game. FSU actually kept it close for a while, but Smith and Edwards really put it away. Greene and Shockley also deserve credit.  I watched The Barbershop yesterday. Surprisingly good, but it was lacking in the emotional appeal area. I think there was a bit left to be desired, but still good nonetheless.  And I'm done setting up the TCS forum. All that remains now is to change the links on the mainpage. And now I'm adding the "2003 Counter" to the counter thingy, fyi.

      I'm not one to make resolutions, much less keep them, but I'll see what gives.  1. Be a more affable character. 2. Be the TMK guy at the right times (and the right places). 3. Find my purpose in life. 4. Get into a good college. 5. Make it to 2004 in one piece. 6. Stay away from long-term relationships. 7. Make progress on any fictional stories I may cook up. 8. To cut back on my addiction to motorsport. (well, this will likely be the first one I break) 9. Keep my head on straight. 10. Promise not to insult people I see daily on a blogsite.  I figured I'd try something a little different. It's my first time on the comp all day, since my dad captured it to make a website. How he made the website pissed me off to no end. He ventured into my documents, and basically scoured the TCS directory. Pillaged my design for his website, laughing at me in the process (as he said he would do that, and I didn't think to cover my tracks). Thank goodness TCS 2.0 is php-based (he can't steal that unless he knows the web url).  I broke my silence yesterday and actually found the courage to talk to Sathya online. Of course, it was just the exchange of pleasantries, but hey...really...that was last year.  I've done a little modification to the site in the last 28 hours, and maybe a little more is coming. We'll see. The new TCS forum is coming along nicely. All I have to do now is alter the links to point to the new forum.

       urlLink   , "No special editions this time" Edition  1. What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)? Fiction novels. I'm easily bored by nonfiction and newspapers (although they keep me up to date). The one I despise (okay, so it wasn't asked) is poetry. Hate it, hate it.  2. What is your favorite novel?  The Sum of All Fears , by Tom Clancy.  3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!) As I've said earlier, I despise poetry. However, I did write one for publication in seventh grade (with the Poetry.com group). The stroy behind it is somewhat amusing. It was an assigned deal, and I waited until we arrived in the computer lab to start on it. So, I typed it on the fly, so it would at least rhyme.  4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read? Probably a romance novel or two, but the sight of half-nude guys and women tied up to bedposts on the covers kind of scares me away. Seriously, mystery novels are just that (a mystery) to me. I used to read them as a little kid, but I moved away from that later on.  5. What are you currently reading?  Ten to Midnight , by Toby Murray. It centers around a catastrophic 2008 nuclear war between Russia and America (with a little China mixed in). I recall buying it...scouted it three years on Murray's website, then decided to order it from Amazon/Borders. It was well worth the princely sum (in book terms, $30) I paid for it. This is my second go-round with TTM.

      Once I had time to back away from the first post, I realized I had not one, two, but three things to continue with. (only the post-it I scribbled the second one on is lost, so we're back to two at the TMK blog)  I saw a little kid hit by a car on the way to school. No, I didn't see it occur, but I did see the little kid, who was slumped over in a sleeplike posture on the ground. I suppose, seeing it as he was trying to cross the street (only 25 feet or so from the school), a 7-Series BMW came barreling into his/her path with no chance to stop. It sure looked bad, but all I could see was some adults, an ambulance, and a fire truck converging around an unconscious kid.   "Crap."  If your name is Phillip, you probably won't want to see that word again. Written up, along with fellow CHS website developer  urlLink Dan  for publishing the phrase "filler crap" on the CHS site in plain view of the Principal. Sounds stupid, huh? Well, not really. It was a test run, from what I'm told.   An absurd blunder, an even more absurd punishment. I guess it has to fit the "crime," though, doesn't it?!  Dude! (No, I'm not getting a Dell)  urlLink AudioBlogger ? Sounds neat. I think I'll try it for everyone on Monday.  Arrgghhh....I've been told by a certain eighth grade Science teacher that her girl students think I'm  Mr. Big Stuff.  (yeeerrk) That would be the last thing I could tolerate, being followed around by midget 8th grade girls a foot shorter than me.  Well, Friday. I look forward to something different, and a Fandom addition is in the works, as soon as I find a good link.

      Well, I "forgot" to mention the massage/pant-grabbing episode yesterday, and the ever-annoying (just kidding, I think he knows that) Fleming insisted on me mentioning it.  The details are sketchy, but the story proceeds like so: first, Nicole (sophomore) steals Thomas's (freshman) hat and holds it hostage, seeing it as she wants a massage from him before her soccer game. Thomas gets mad, gets his hat back. Nicole, however, was not to be denied. She brushes (I guess) against Fleming's pants and liked the corduroy sensation. She then demanded to touch his pants (ostensibly to feel the fabric). Fleming retreated away, and she gave pursuit. I guess she cornered him, and then he escaped again.  There, Flemz, happy?  Priya's tennis analogies to her relationship with (identity protected and largely unknown) are quite interesting, so long as you understand the rules of the game. Yesterday it was something like 15-15. Today, she calls it 40-30 in her favor, having followed Sathya's advice and consequently reaped the rewards. Good for her.  Today was actually decent, for once.   Portland Champ Car Town Conference (snippet, couldn't resist poking a little fun at Crapwagons)  Q. I'm Mike from Aloha, Oregon. My wife Sandra, we actually met at the race a few years back before we got married. Two-part question. Has there been any more discussions with Tony George about reuniting? What about the teams that have defected to IRL? How long do you think it's going to be because those guys get tired of going around in circles?   SCOTT PRUETT (former Champ Car driver, currently on Speed telecasts): I know Franchitti is not happy about it.    JIMMY VASSER(1996 Champ Car Champion, current driver) : Some of those guys are already tired of it.   CHRIS POOK (CEO of CART): I'm on record on numerous occasions. My office door is open. My phone is available to be answered. I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for that phone to ring. I'm going to get on and do what I've got to do in this series to get on with what we've got because it's too good to wait around for somebody to pick up the phone and talk to us. It's going to be very difficult. It's going to be a very difficult situation for us if those teams decide they do want to come back because we have got new teams that have come in in good faith, put themselves on the line to join our series and invest in our series. We have got guys that are guaranteeing loans. One guy's got his house on the line. He's really committed to building a team.

      ChampCars at Road Atlanta? ...hmm...fix the last corner, build a fanbase, and we'll see...  More later, aside from this post.  "My balls are in your court?!" -Ben  Well, not really. That came from the bus, where we had to sit through Priya and Sathya debating this guy. Story: guy from another school presumably likes Priya, she likes him. They'd gone out (ostensibly as friends). Guy stopped talking to her online all of a sudden, she's wondering what he's thinking. Now, the ball is in which court? (I'm probably not being as reserved as usual when it comes to the names, but oh well...)  And so goes her argument that his constantly IM-ming her puts the ball in her court, and now his silence takes the ball out of the game entirely. My counter to that was that it was always under his control.  He  did not have to IM her, meaning it was his decision and his ball to serve, right? Continuing, the ball goes into her court if the consensus (if you count Sathya and myself as the majority) is that he stopped talking to her proactively to see if she would try talking to him. Following? Good. (not that I seriously care if you are or not) The uncomfortable moment came when I inadvertently painted a bad picture of guys in the courtship sense. I hinted that guys aren't usually good-natured unless there was something else to gain. Yeah. Right. I said that to fill in the conversation, only to realize I'd screwed myself again. Why? I was the same good-natured kind of guy (in reference to one female whose name I've already mentioned in this post) I said didn't really exist. At least in the summer I was. I had nothing to gain, just fostering an interest in a friend, but I think the sentiment...hey...that's a good point, TMK...I was bitten by my own sentiment! Whoa. I allowed myself to fall victim to the 'guys-have-an-ulterior-motive-when-it-comes-to-girls' concept. I  didn't  have one, but everyone  thought  I had one, and I...the rest is history.   Now, of course, I had experience with a variation of the online interpersonal politics deal, with Julia. Of course, I never went anywhere with her, but I remember letting her do the IM thing first. That kind of annoyed her, it seemed. She thought she was annoying me, so it was a bad deal all around. So, later on, I would serve the ball myself. No response. A week later. No response. I sat back and realized something disintegrated, and haven't spoken to her since. My point? There isn't one.

      I guess that Popdex link got too popular. Once again, it's disappeared.  In any case, the archives were hastily repackaged yesterday and it shows. In a few days I might do an overline thing with the links...just to try something new.  eXtreme is out, Site Meter is in. If I have time (5 min. at school), I'll do it here.  I really don't have much to offer for today as of yet, except a tale or two...  End of second period: Sathya's looking for Emily. I hint away at Emily's locker, and she heads off over there. Less than ten seconds later, Emily approached from the opposite direction looking for Sathya. And, as luck wouldn't have it, they missed each other. It was...interesting. I suppose one had to be part of that to get the humor.  End of third period/ Reads: I fell asleep, I guess. It was planned, but I didn't anticipate not hearing the bell. So, almost a minute after the bell, Priya walks in and wakes me up. It wouldn't have been funny, but there were three others also asleep.  Another one, per Fleming's request, on massages and pant-grabbing, to come later.

      It will truly be a bad day for Hagan when the world runs out of paper resources. Fwahahahaha...then she couldn't assign unbelievable homework assignments due at 8:15AM  before  school! (well, actually, she might force us all to memorize the homework for in-class recitals...)   Sorry, I think I'm on some Robin Williams champagne. He's got the new quote, and I've added about 60 megs of him through Kazaa.  Kudos to Toni Smith, the Division III basketball player protesting the national anthem over America's foreign policy (read: Iraq)...I was listening to a radio show yesterday on 680 The Fan, and I was dismayed to hear the host and a guest (both males) going on about how she shouldn't be doing that or shouldn't be allowed to do that. Last time I checked, it was a free country. Last time I checked, not placing a hand on one's chest or turning 90 degrees away (as Smith did) is  not  illegal. Some call it disrespectful, I call it wearing your feelings on your jersey. For crying aloud, she's done it all season up in Manhattanville. The only time she was called on it was when some Vietnam wipeout ran on court with a flag and waved it in her face during some free throws. To the radio guys: She's not your daughter, why should you care?  Oh yeah, and Chris Reeve's on Smallville tonight.

      Well...it certainly looks like this site is in the midst of a hellstorm of technical difficulties. First the archives went screwy, then the Sunday post has the blog being set several days back in time. Yesterday it was the 20th, today the 18th.  Good news (for Sathya and pep rally skippers, at least)...No referrals handed out. I figured that once a week or so passed, they (the Faculty) either had more referrals than they could deal with or they were never going to assess a serious penalty on her or the crew.  Our prom now has a title: "A Rose Left Uncaptured"....yeah. What a joke! I need to find the committee that coined the name and personally give them all a piece of my mind. Or, rather, a piece of my fists. What a sissy title. I mean, not that I could come up with a substantially superior title than that off the top of my head, but this one flat out sucks.  "Ms. Knapp lost weight?" -MG, during a conversation about people (namely Shaq) who've been bigger, lost weight, and still look huge. "It would be fabulous if we shoot Antarctica" -Marbury, student-teacher for History....from a rather stupid discussion about ICBMs (of which half the class probably has no idea of the translation)...  More later, I suppose. Computer science stuff was done in advance, leaving me to do this. But  why  can't we be out of school due to weather? Okay, TMK, it's sunny and dry outside. What more could you ask for?

      You know, something went screwy with this blog after yesterday's disastrous entries. It suddenly reverted back to February 20th and its entries. I was pretty concerned, considering I had no idea anything like this was going on...so I removed the normal blog description and...  Today was busy. Unlike some people I know who simply spent the day off mallhopping, I was cajoled into going to school to help out my mom for five hours. I planned to put in the entry there, but never got enough daylight to do so. Following that I headed to Northlake for lunch, and then on to my dermatologist, and then to get some more rubber bands, and then home to wash the G20. In three lines, I've retraced my day.  I suppose there comes a time in every life when there is a full disclosure with family. Mine was last night, and consequently appointments are being made. I suppose I shouldn't have been so hard on them, completely demoralized them twice each in the two-hour discussion, but it seems like things are different now. I rather like the new era around here, just not the way I accomplished the change. Consequently, my parents no longer know what to think of me. They never knew (and, to a large degree, still don't know) what the true nature of my mind is. Well, neither do I, but who's counting here?

      Well, damn. It looks like I just lost the rest of my entries over a simple case of trying to alter some fonts. I can't edit or delete the post, which means we're all stuck with it for now. It also means this site is dangerously out of shape, given the right side in comparison to the lounge's last two entries.  So, we're going to kill some time and some space, until this deal is resolved (or hidden).   urlLink Blog Ideas  random topic number one: Why do dogs sniff each other in the ass?

If you do, make sure I'm not within a mile of you when you say so.   urlLink Blog Ideas  random topic number two: When was the last time you said 'I Love You'? Never. I'm not lying, either. I've gone to the brink of saying it, only to fall back to the ranks of reality.   urlLink Blog Ideas  random topic number three: What should we do with stupid people? Shoot them. Seriously, this is a horrible question. It would be most unfair to lump the lazy with the unable in such a question. One can't do much for the lazy, except to shoot them or something. The unable, on the other hand...hmm...now for the actual question, I guess...Patience, I guess. We'll see just how unable they are if we give them time. (And we (meaning society) have, but in some unfortunate cases not nearly enough)   urlLink Blog Ideas  random topic number four: Seriously... Where does the other sock end up? Up your ass. Seriously.   urlLink Blog Ideas  random topic number five: Behind the scenes of 'Your Blog', the movie. Dude...here's one I might be able to expound upon...  For starters, it wouldn't be called "Your Blog"...it would be something like..."TMK vs. The World" or some crazy mess like that.  After that, I'd of course be the director and the main star. For the players I'd cast Kalin, Sathya, Phillip, JC, Shyaam, and maybe Priya in lead roles, among many others...maybe some guest linkers disguised as celebrities or something...there would certainly be a female lead...maybe I'll cast an Alicia Keys lookalike as that. Of course, TMKvsWorld would have scores of fictional characters, some based on actual people, some purely from imagination.  The story would center around some guy (namely  me ) and his quest for self-satisfaction. He's chronically depressed, sometimes suicidal, and a loose cannon. I'd probably script the main star to have a rival who transforms into a romantic interest, with the lead guy fighting himself to determine if he wants to go after her. The story would probably climax with some major emotional conflict, like maybe the death of the new female lead at the end, murdered by one of the real-world cast members...who knows?  There would be a club, not a lunatic lounge...more like the Deux Garcons (French for Two Guys) and a nightclub or something.   There would probably be a revolving door of affairs and rivalries...I'd never cast myself in them, though...there would probably a nuclear war in the middle.  I don't know...it would be interesting...Wait...you mean I just blew the doors off TMK+9? Damn!   urlLink Blog Ideas  random topic number six: What is something scientists need to invent? A machine to make me invisible and then to consequently clone me. Why? So I could have one version of myself to behave as I would  (in a perfect world, he'd be smarter and have the personality of more than a used moth ball) , enabling me to wreak havoc on the rest of the world.

      Note: ARRGH...repeat posts? For the love of....send me a criminy,  please!  Now, for the actual entry:  I’ve been rather quiet the last couple of days, and it feels…liberating.  **Guaranteed $150 or free PlayStation 2 for anyone who can successfully make it to the end of this and leave a message.   First off, SciOly was bad until I realized CHS was there. After that, it got worse. I didn’t anticipate being in the gym, on my feet from 10:15 to about 2:30, nor did I feel comfortable in the crowd. I’m not querulous about this stuff most of the time, but yesterday was an extraordinary aberration. I mean, 2.5 hot volunteer partners is great and all, but it wasn’t enough. And our outcome? Second overall in the regional, which means the team is solidly in the field for the State competition. So much for under-preparation.  Second, I just felt like chilling from the site for a while as I look for ways to improve this thing. Obviously, the comments aren’t going as they should be (perhaps I’m scaring people away, or maybe people are too…not sure), so I’ll probably bring back the somewhat more interesting shoutbox and throw it in on the side somewhere. That was a pretty long sentence, I say.   urlLink Aznsccrgy’s (aka Fleming)  xanga is starting to look like this place did last November. It’s a most unwise path for him to take (I would know, since I took it), but TMK is simply going to go there periodically for entertainment purposes.  Wait a damn minute! You mean to tell me that   duct tape   holds this country together? Did I miss something? *smirks gloomily* Hey, one more! You mean to tell me that these guys exhorting the American public to stock up an essentials and upping the terrorist alert meter are the  same  people who declared that we will never give in to terrorists? Or am I just missing something?  The new site trackers are doing horribly thus far, in comparison to the ones already there. Extreme was down this morning, and Re_inv in the early afternoon.  urlLink Re_invigorate  is still tops, though, among the two.  Nothing can be worse than boring racing, and today featured a double-dose of it in the Champ Car and Winston Cup sessions. Champ Car in St. Pete was a parade, Winston Cup at The Rock was a poor experience for RCR fans like myself. I don’t know why, but I figured the Fords would be good there, and I was dead right on that.  Speaking of boring…never mind.  Random tidbit from an article on the projected casualties resulting from an attack on CONUS by Russian nuclear forces:   “George W. Bush has called for major reductions in the US and Russian arsenals. Reportedly, after his first briefing as President on US nuclear forces Bush was stunned. “I had no idea we had so many weapons,” he said. “What do we need them for?”    urlLink Kalin  seems to have his site in order, once more, especially the news/weblog design. Weblog, not blog. He’s blatantly crossed the line this time.  **Prizes or prize money may not exist in reality.

      I get the feeling I should be out and about like everyone else I know, but I'm going to follow my own lead and say a little something about today.  I've deleted two starts to today's entry, so here goes Round Three.  I added a pair of hit counters, one popular and the other not-so-pop... urlLink Re_invigorate's  invisible, but it's there. And that's cool. eXtreme...well, I'm tired of HitBox. Re_invig's tight, seeing it as it has an instant site visitor update thing that beeps every time someone visits...  I hate to say it, but it's almost cute, the Priya-Phillip relationship. Here you go, the cynical-but-likeable guy, and the likeable-but-slap-happy girl. I guess today was one of those anti-guy days for her, although I wouldn't blame her. We (the guys) cornered her on the bus, and then stuck Phil next to her to annoy her. It was so funny to watch, waiting for her to explode. When she did, well...she lost her nail paint. Ouch, and as a ferocious little sophomore, you have no choice but to snort with laughter at the pair of them. And TMK just missed the point he was trying to make. gah...  Speaking of laughter, there was some kind of cultural arts presentation during B lunch. It was absolute garbage. I don't know who selected these wankstas as performers, but they sucked. It's not a diss on the cultural aspect of it, but I swear, my grandmother could outperform those people. It's a wonder that no one laughed aloud, but hey, that's the way it's supposed to be, isn't it?  Speaking of not laughing, not many people were after another pop quiz in (Hounds of) Hagan math. I was chugging along until the one speedbump turned into three, sinking my chances to improve my grade in there. Damn, it's not the teacher, it's the assessments.  As I mentioned earlier, SciOly tomorrow morning, so if nothing else, I'll credit myself with a free tee shirt.  TCS has been awful quiet as of late, and it's still of no surprise to me. Central braintrust goes down, goodbye newspaper. Not a single hit today on the site. Forum's been quiet the last ten days. TCS may soon disappear into the ranks of the forgotten...  ChampCar/Winston Cup  season/race predictions : Sebastien Bourdais, rookie, is on the provisional pole in St. Pete. Basically all the ChampCar guys are handing him Rookie of the Year honors, but I'm going to step over them by predicting Sebastien as the champ for this year. He's got the speed, the team, and the opportunity. On the Cup side, my pick for champ is Ryan Newman, despite his end-over-end tumble last week in the 500. Tony Stewart did it last year, coming from dead-last in points to win the title, I don't think Newman's case is any different. Rookie of the Year? Biffle. You'd be an idiot to pick against him. Fords will rule on Sunday...look for at least two Roush cars in the top ten by the drop of the checkers. So concludes my motorsport prediction section for this year. Hope I'm not wrong on all counts.

       , "Didn't miss it this time" edition  1. What is your most prized material possession? Hmm...I don't believe I have a super-prized one...quite possibly my scribblenotebook for any ideas I get on the go, maybe my Cingular or my mp3 player, but I guess it might be my computer. I'd say it's a tech thing for me. There's a letter from someone I used to be friends with that means a ton to me, but not all that much anymore, really, since it's like a time warp.  2. What item, that you currently own, have you had the longest? My eyes, j/k...my furniture? Eight years or so, almost everything else in my room has had a bowel movement in that time.  3. Are you a packrat? Hell yeah. I've got homework assignments from second grade stashed. Second grade being nine years ago, by the way. Meaningless newspapers from 1996 and up. A worthless Atari. Several-sizes too small LA Gears from about 1992. Yeah. Classic (for me, anyway) stuff.  4. Do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? Or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum? A mix of the two. At times I prefer the clean approach, at others I need to express the state of my internal being. In other words, it depends on whenever I feel like cleaning.  5. Do the rooms in your house have a theme? Or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there? Well, my room bucks the trend. Otherwise, we've got artwork in about every room. Most of the rooms on the upper two levels of the house are covered in purple carpet, the rest being in white. I guess my parents are working the snazzy thing, not sure. Me? I've got a pullout on the F-22 Raptor, the 2003 Infiniti FX45, Bugs Bunny and Taz on motorcycles, a blurb on Robby Gordon, a pullout on Beyonce Knowles holding a Pepsi, and I've got a MJ poster too pissy to straighten out (I'm torturing it on the floor for now). Not much, but I'm working on it.

      Morbid retrospection?   Sorry about NewsisFree (or Newsisn'tfree, I suppose), Kalin. I'm sure there's other feeds out there.  I guess something about that last post is making me uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Nothing against the gender, just a bit unwilling to side with them this time. Perhaps it's the thing when you behave in reference to them with total goodwill, only to get scorn in return...I don't know. I shouldn't be blogging this early in the morning.  I think I'll hook up a sitemeter here before too long, as it seems the rest of the world already has one.  The ChampCar season begins this weekend in St. Petersburg. Finally. Sigh. And now I can watch it all on Speed...Sigh. And the Cup cars are at The Rock...sigh...and no crapwagons yet...even bigger sigh.  I guess I'll be at SciOly tomorrow, after all, just in a different capacity than expected.

      An entertaining conversation ensued following B lunch in the lit class. Some of the girls in our class (I would name names, but I won't today...the reference that three of the four are in either Nia Umoja or Drama will suffice) had been carrying on about the role of women in our society, and more specifically, the exploitation of women.  They did raise a couple of good points (I'm not a woman, so I can't comment on those), but a snide (although true) comment from Tres set them off, just as the conversation was about to simmer. Tres commented on the reason why women are always on the covers of magazines in certain positions and the like, mostly because women draw more attention. The girls jumped him for that, although their claim that it was "guys only" was somewhat correct. Sure, guys react to it, simply because of our inherent think-with-your-dick-then-your-brain-later nature. Hell, why do you think pornography is so popular? (Porno brings me to the next point they raised, the "sexploitation" (okay, I coined this one, not them) of women).   One of them, the drama member, "complained" that it's always women in the starring roles of porno movies, unless it's gay porn or something. (At the time, it was hilarious to the guys). Well, duh, ladies. Do you think guys (the same think-with-dick people I mentioned earlier) would prefer to watch two  gay  guys do it (no matter how good-looking they are)? Hell no. Would we rather watch two gay women do it? Depends on how good-looking they are (but the answer is yes), and the reason for that is simple. Guys want to be  the  picture, not  in  the picture. If we have to see another guy in our place, we'd rather not see it at all if we don't have to. Straight-up couples? Well, not really for guys (for obvious reasons), unless they're doing an inordinate amount of pretending while watching. Jealousy...some women/girls think we're incapable of it, not quite. We experience it daily, just in the smallest of ways. So yes, women are sexploited, and it's partly their own fault, too. I think men deserve the onus of the blame, but certainly not the whole of it.  And the reason why I just blabbered on about the kinds of porno movies guys would watch is...? To demonstrate the basic relationship with less vague sexual references than I'm used to. ActualIy, I don't know. Maybe someone can tell me...  Freshman...uh....no. Get a little taller, grow up some more, and maybe then you'll get off the Ultimate Wanksta status. Sophomores...you'll get there. Not much has been made of the classic CHS Senior-Junior deal this year, and even less (I think) has been made of next year's clash. Not that I care much, but some of them draw ire.

      Well, it's not as though this (below post topic) hasn't happened before. It probably happens before every World War...  I was walking home from the bus today and I came across something on the ground. It looked a little like a piece of meat that fell out of some car, and a lot like a piece of newspaper plastic. When I came within good visual range, I realized I really should have known. It was a squirrel, or, rather, what was left of one. The head had been detonated, it seemed, and blood was everywhere. The newspaper plastic? That was the tail. A little disgusting, yeah. Sorry.  That plan I concocted yesterday hasn't failed, but there's a classic hole in it, so...maybe it can wait until after the Choices, not chances college fair scheduled for tonight.

      Well, here's a story from lunch.  Three girls have something a guy wants back. Apparently they had stolen this thing from him while he was eating. The guy claimed to have many of them, but specifically wanted this one back. The girls exploited the argument in the previous sentence to keep the object away. He grabbed a purse, but the girl to whom it belonged smacked him and took it back.  Ring, ring , the lunch bell tolled. I packed my stuff away and shadowed behind the "crisis".  Random chatter: "Come on girl, give it back!" "No! Why you have one of them, anyway?" "Cuz I need it!" "You got others!" "But I like this one! I got a whole shelf for em in my room!" (something to the tune of "I need this one back to complete the collection")  What was it? Tune in tomorrow.   Today was what, on the outset, could have been one of my top ten worst days ever. Luckily for me, progress reports notwithstanding, it wasn't. I've concocted a devilishly dangerous plan to stay afloat from them, and six hours into Mission You-don't-know-impossible, I'm alive. The bus was calm...I tried, for the first time in a while, to include a certain someone in my conversations, and I guess she didn't mind this time. Another one of those good little discussions, I say.  There was a scheduled tornado drill, but if there actually was a tornado, we all would have perished. None of us took it seriously on the History hall (I was in French upstairs, but the Administration insisted on having all of us on the ground floor). We all pissed into the wind, really.  I had more to say, but I'll save it for later.  However, the comments box has returned. Long overdue, though. I nearly bailed back to enetation, which I relegated back to Guys' Room. About damned time.

      I had a couple of other things to get to first, but breaking news changed that. You call out one Lunatic, you're gonna get em all (in the abbreviated words of the St. Lunatics).  Say, that Schmyler e-mail...what a riot. Unbelievable. What the hell did I/we do to him? Maybe he needs his teddy bear. I'd love to piece up that e-mail (which was actually directed at TCS) and then tear it down for everyone else to see.  On second thought, no. But I will cover some basic points, as he seems obsessed with the Lunatics, and me in particular. Operating under apparently two assumed names, our favorite lounge troll made these key points:  1: The TCS  urlLink poll  doesn't have his answer choice (typed as none of the above), which is actually:  More coloring books.  2: He thinks the articles are "boring and lacking in scope"... I certainly challenge the little prick to outdo us. 3: He thinks  I (TMK)  am TCS, which basically means he's missing the point entirely, which continues to... 4: He thinks this place's sole purpose is to be...boring. Understandable point, but also understandably shallow. 5: He thinks I'm a jackass. I'm  human , sorry. 6: He gets annoyed by the style points I'm getting for the use of (riminy, or at least the ( in place of C. Trolls... 7: And he concluded with the following: "Quit sniffing glue and start doing something worthwhile that doesn't poison the entire Internet community with your drivel." Well, quit poisoning  us  with your idiocy. Please do us a favor and quit trolling, whenever you return. Thank you.    And to the tune of Kazoo Four... Dear Kazoo, I'm a moronic imbecile with a funny name. I can't tell the difference between its and it's. Anyway, my problem is, I, uh, found this web blog written by this, uh, pothead who talks to plants and thinks I'm on PMS whenever I call him on it. Then I found the newspaper, which he helps produce. The articles were better than anything I could ever have done, but all I can say is that the website design sucks [sic]. He's hurting my self-esteem, and I'm becoming obsessed with him. I want to show him how I truly feel, but I don't know how. Do you have any advice, Kazoo? -Schmyler  Schmyler: (snore, snore...) Uh, what was your question? I'm sorry. You must be one of those moody crossdressers I see every week. Except you, my "friend" have the plant-conversing pot head reference confused, unlike the thinking idiots I come across daily at work. Here's my advice to you, in multiple choice format. A: Go away and never return. B: Stop trolling. C: Jump off the Grand Canyon D: Kiss my ass. E: All of the above.  It's your choice. Loser.

       , "Oops, I missed it again" edition  1. Explain why you started to journal/blog. That's a pretty easy one, I suppose. I read a Newsweek article from Steven Levy (I think) back in August, and I thought it was a pretty cool concept. So, I came up with this little thing, in a much different incarnation than it is now.  2. Do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? Why or why not? Well, some people know about this, but certainly not the parents. I try to keep it clean, but that's not the point. Why? The people that know about it simply know because of word of mouth. I didn't drag anyone into devoted blogging. I guess Kalin/MrK540 got his own blog started up at the  urlLink Mac Shac  solely from my urging, but that's about it. I probably have about 14 fulltime viewers (maybe more, but still sad, eh?), and there are some people I'd rather have not read this thing.  3. Do you have a theme for your journal/blog? It's boring.  4. What direction would you like to have your journal/blog go in over the next year? Well, I'd love to have a comments box that actually gets used. In other words, feedback from people. So, most likely, I'll try a little bit in the next month to get an affiliate section up so people can leave links and stuff (I do that now, but I want a devoted section). Otherwise, I'd like to get some more posters here and make this more "dicey", so long as no more feathers are removed (not ruffled).  5. Pimp five of your favorite journals/blogs. Uh-oh. So they can't include any of mine?  Damn.

      Kalin, drop the lunacy. Please.   Well, all I can say is “Race, Interrupted.” I will deal with Daytona, however, later on.  I had one of those maddeningly bizarre debates with myself, wondering what makes a good blog entry. Is it the humor? The subject matter? The person behind the letters? The language used in the entries, no matter how colorful? Well, I wish I knew, as it seems I can do nothing else but talk about myself as of late. In the early months of the blog, I was pretty wild, commenting about North Korea, complaining about Sathya, railing on Hagan, and other stuff. And it worked for a while for me, it ruffled feathers…then I took it too far in November, and so the throttle on the stuff lifted. What resulted is the boring, verbose lunatic typing right now. Hell, there are five registered members on this thing, but only two of them have posted recently. The other three have a combined handful of posts, the last of which was during the hit tracker blowup. And here we go again, complaining about people. That’s me for me.  Funny, how quickly Columbia disappeared from the front page, most likely replaced by something about some war in some country very few of us really care about. Oh, so we get a ton of our oil from them? Hmm…didn’t know that. You mean to tell me that this country actually dared to defy the world? Wow. How come the US hasn’t done anything about it? You tell me. Maybe it’s the fact that the rest of the world, save the American pet bitch, Great Britain, and that other country supporting America, Spain, wants little to do with a war. A war the Americans cannot justify, unless it’s with hackneyed evidence of past offenses. I don’t know why I just said all that, but I did.  I find it almost funny, TCS. The brain trust of the newspaper goes down with a grounding and the whole newspaper grinds to a halt. Everywhere I hear people griping about having cartoons and articles being put on (indefinite?) hold. I myself am bored with not having anything to do with the website. It’s really no surprise to me, seeing it that all TCS e-mail goes to one email address, controlled by one person, with a layout coordinated by one person. (Yes, there’s an emphasis on the number one) So, when that one person is pulled from the equation, TCS becomes a headless ogre in search of eyes.  On a similar note, I planned to do some advice stuff for TCS, but the uncertain status of the newspaper has placed those plans on Line Fourteen. I’m waiting…Of course, there’s always the rejects from last week. I know some of us weren’t exactly impressed, but (riminy if I didn’t tag a “test” on them.  Only a couple of times in my memory can I recall having a big event cut so drastically short by rain, and this one is by far the easier to remember. Just 272.5 miles (yes, I did the math) into the 500, the race was permanently halted.  I think we fans, as a collective whole, were pretty shortchanged by the decision, although it was the only thing NASCAR could have done, according to the rulebook. But damn, this is Daytona…Lots of teams and drivers were screwed by the decision, my RCR guys included. Most of the teams were out there biding their time in the draft, waiting for the end before making a move.  I was impressed with the drive of the RCR guys. Kevin and Robby worked together in the draft on numerous occasions, although never always to ultimate success. Jeff was hung out to dry on the first lap and never really was a factor, unfortunately. But hey, Robby and Kevin start the season in the top ten in points. Mikey really didn't deserve that win, and there he was, celebrating like he'd earned it or something. I still think he's kind of cool, but that was really uncalled for, as half the field was still gunning for him. And Newman's flip was nothing short of spectacular. The whole back end of the car flew out, thanks to the opening on one of the walls, and the car just  flew .

      Random quote: “No, there aren’t stupid questions. Just stupid people asking questions.” Speaking of stupid, it may be stupid of me to preface this post, but I’ll just say that if you don’t fall asleep by the end of this one, I will personally pay you two thousand dollars*.  Well, I’m really little more than furious right now. Only 22 hours ago did I think I was headed out of town, only to find out that my grounding included the Birmingham trip, although it was merely an academic sightseeing trip in my eyes. Hearing it from the parents about not going didn’t set me off as it probably would have months ago. This time, it was like throwing gasoline on my fire. I didn’t take it out on anything, just held it in. I was beyond mad, but my built-in frown didn’t show anything extraordinary. Besides, I had Daytona hanging in the balance and I didn’t want to jeopardize that. It threw a carton of eggs on my face, since I’d already proclaimed I’d be going, and that really made my ears red.  I had an odd dream last night…If one’s kept up with me for the last month or so, it would be easy to tell that I’m single and not looking, regardless of which couples form and disintegrate (ahem…). That really wasn’t the case in the dream, when a new friend of mine suddenly grabbed me and pecked me (something went down on Friday seemed to make this logical), prompting a surprising response from me. The response was obvious, and left me wondering why I dreamt about that when I woke up. But hey, it’s not like I was making out with someone on the wrong side of pretty…Unfortunately, it was somewhat realistic for me, so I’ll remind myself to be careful around this one next week.  TCS Online added a new member to the forum, and he promptly came in and gave me something to think about: criticism. Somerandomguy was the first guy (I guess) to come to the TCS forum and criticize something about the site…Better to have constructive criticism than vitriol, I suppose.  I may be re-adding the shoutbox here, since it’s become a one-guy show, surprise posts from Kalin notwithstanding. I visit other blogs and there’s always a plethora of posts with comments under them…my last one was about a month ago…which is indirectly why I canceled the board.  Of course, the official racing season began today, with Junior winning a snoozer. Kevin led the first 53 laps, a boring 53 at that, but at least Kevin was the leader. I (and at least 70% of the racing fan community) am extremely pissed at that “cue-ball headed fool”, Todd Bodine, as he speared Jimmy Vasser (a CART guy making his first Busch start) going into turn three, causing Vasser to wreck and take out three other cars. A novice’s lesson in Physics will tell you two things: one, never ram a car turning on a banked surface, and two, never ram a car going into a turn. Bodine violated the second rule, and knowingly so. The fool’s already been put on probation before for stupid driving and should never have gotten off it. That’s all I have to say about that.  As far as tomorrow goes…I may as well pick Earnhardt Jr. or Waltrip. A DEI car, I suppose, will win. Yes, yes, I know, RCR’s been strong all week, and has the first and third starting spots, but DEI is too strong when the aforementioned two are in line. On a tangential path, though, it would be most unwise to overlook the other 37 (non-DEI/RCR cars) drivers in the field. Take last year, for example. Winner: Dale Jr. Dark horse: Of course, Robby. He’s been the surprise of the week, and he’s got a stout car. He skipped the final practice, the car was so good. The Big One: I foresee between twelve and seventeen cars involved in the wreck, if it does happen. (And I don’t, since I’m not a bloodthirsty racing fan)…Bodine will probably set it off, probably doing something stupid.  * Prize amount may not necessarily exist.

      I just finished my third and final site makeover. The Mac Shac is looking rather slick. I got the base code from the Gameranger site(www.gameranger.com) and filled it in with new images and stuff to make it look Maclike. Hope ya like.  NewsIsFree is back. They promptly fixed the problem. Apparently, the guy forgot to update the "old" layout and that's why it wouldn't let me post. Daily Mac News is back in business!  Wow...this blog got a makeover also. Looks very good. Can't get over the boring-lunatic lounge image. It fits the blog very well. Good work.  TCS needs to come out. I've got a cartoon and an article in it and I am very eager to respond to the PC article by Jim. I suspect I'll have much to say.

      I began one post, only to have the PC freeze in mid-sentence, so here goes again.  The weekend...early start, too...Going to Birmingham tomorrow for an all-day trip, and then watching the 500 on Sunday. The hype is starting to come together...RCR vs. DEI. Rows One and Two going at it. My apologies if I can't be too pleased with RCR's performance. Hell, Robby's got two articles to himself today.  urlLink R. Gordon 'brakes' through in first 125 - February 14, 2003 ...this would be awesome, simply put, if Robby can get RCR that second 500 win, but it's 500 long miles on Sunday...  I didn't think juniors still gave out valentines (I stopped giving and receiving seven years ago, that streak being broken last year), but I guess I was wrong. I got one today, and a ton of others got the balloon/flower/chocolate/singing carnation combinations, more than I'd ever noticed.  Looks like Joe Schmo (the guy duplicating my counter) still hasn't figured out (or doesn't care) that he's still using my counter...been screwing around with my stats, and promoting his site all the while. If this keeps up, I think I'll leave a not-so-nice message at his site...  And TMK+9 has gone out of my control...It teaches an important lesson about blogger: if you have a site you're not using, don't delete it. Or else.

NewsIsFree, which I couldn't stop praising last week, has taken a sharp turn and headed down buggy-oh-my-god-please-fix-or-i-will-shoot-you lane. Not only will it not let me change the format back to "original", but it won't even let me post my Daily Mac News to The Mac Shac Blog. This is not a good thing at all. At a point where my site needs publicity the most, I have no news feeds. It turns out that when I select the articles to blog and click on "blog it" it sends me to a blank page with a template around it that looks very much like the other pages on NewsIsFree. I posted a message on their stone age forum and I might just get an answer. Who knows...  I fixed my site. I really don't know why I put the right frame in there. It was pointless so I moved the links to the main page. Thanks for pointing it out. DK3 seems to work great. The blog is going ok besides NewsIsFree and the layout issue. If I could just figure out how to center stuff according to the window. It hurts when you don't have an instruction manual for DW MX and the Macromedia help online is cumbersome.  That girl's blog....pathetic...  ...and scary...  Nice Lounge graphx. I give my applause for your efforts. TCS is screwed until JC does math homework. That will be awhile...and I don't blame him...yuck!  TCS site looks better than ever. Splendid. Tomorrow is a wonderful half day. Let us hope for the best my friend. :)

      Tomorrow is a half-day, so I'll be looking forward to that.  Among the plans tomorrow are to at least begin math homework, set up the new TCS site without a redesign, and to redesign this place. Saturday I'll be in Birmingham for a historical trip for church.    Just one more question and answer, since my first batch apparently didn't go over well. This one's pointless, but I figured, what the hell, let's throw it in the mix. Dear Mr. Four, I sometimes have fantasies about my math teacher. She's 45 years old and divorced. Well, Mr. Four, the point is, I want to approach her, but I don't know how because I keep popping up whenever I'm near her! Help!    -male, 15 years old   Little boy:  Don't.    I'm really pleased right now...and it's not school related... RCR driver Robby Gordon will start third at Daytona, having won a Twin 125 qualifying race. It was exactly as I envisioned it, the veterans getting in line and not mixing it up much...of course, Dumb(Ass)Ears Kurt Busch (a blue-oval driver) blew the tires in the second race, cut in front of Kevin and cost Kevin a good car...that makes me mad, since he seems to have this thing with being a total moron on pit road, especially in proximity to my RCR cars... Chevy  all the way...predictions later.

      Today wasn't bad, (example, we played pictionary in Hagan's math, don't know what the sub, a senile retirement-age woman, thought of it), but I'm not going into detail...I was bored, so I did a test-fire of the TCS advice column.  Ask Mr. Four, Round One:   Dear Mr. Four,   I started seeing this girl a month ago, and last week we kissed. It got to be a lot more than just that later, but then she told me that she has a boyfriend and stuff. My question is this: Should I pathetically call her daily and bug her online until she can't take it anymore, forget her, kill her, or kill myself ?  -Unsure   Unsure : All of the above, since you obviously are too stupid to figure out the most logical answer.    Mr. Four,  I'm seventeen and I'm a Power Rangers fan. Unfortunately, there isn't any fan apparel left for me to buy. What should I do? -P.R. (for life!) Fan   Power Ranger fan , Grow up. Now.     Mr. Four:  I have three major tests next week...I also have to show up for a Counterstrike match for my UltraPowerfulManiacs clan, all day Saturday and Sunday. Should I study or blow up my friends online? -Puzzled (Message has been edited from l337 language to something more legible)   Puzzled:  CounterStrike, you idiot.    Mr. Four,  I need your help. In the afternoons in 5th and 6th period, I get the uncontrollable urge to rip one. All the time, too. But I always worry about what people would think if I did. If you were me, what would you do? -Lonny Bergerman, sophomore   Lonny:  At least you didn't give the rest of us a face to go with the name.    Dear Mr. Four,  I'm a freshman girl with a senior boyfriend. Well, He's a senior with three girlfriends, and I'm the only one who knows he's 3-timin them. I think he needs to be castrated. What do you think? -Very angry freshman   Little freshman girl,  Who cares?     Kazoo Four, commonly known as Mr. Four, is a nationally syndicated columnist.   Well, that's all the questions I have time to answer now...be sure to come back later for next week's edition of...Ask Mr. Four! Or, if you're so eager to get some advice, leave a message.

       urlLink Ouch . A colossal ouch...and I thought the majority of us have it bad. Interesting idea, but I'd never, ever, submit to that. You never know what you'll find with Blogger.com...  I think TCS is going to get a new host sometime soon. The freshman guy that wants to help with the site recommended an awesome link to T35, which is unlimited and free, with php...so..we'll see...and WTH is goin' on with TCS IX?? JC?

      I'm pretty bored right now...(and I'm here saying that, which seems to mean that I'm not as grounded as I thought I was)...  Here I am, screwed again. But certainly not like the Dell  urlLink dude , Steven (aka Ben Curtis).  I woke up at 4:40 to study some math, and at 4:41 (this is in the morning, mind you), I said, "Fuck it! I need some sleep." And sleep I did. And fail I did. (or so I suspect)  Well, since I'm so bored, I'm going to post a snippet of an online convo from earlier...not like Nicole, who printed an encyclopedia of IMs...sophomores (what can I say?)...topic is  Smallville's  Lex and Lex's dad... ChampCarFan2931: well, I thought he was an annoying bald guy back then...not to suck up, but he is cool ChampCarFan2931: I heard his bro was going to be on tonight's episode kornchick1787: yup. kornchick1787: his brother is hot too. kornchick1787: he is hot, his brother is hot.. even his dad is kind of cute. ChampCarFan2931: so you'd go for a 50-year old guy? kornchick1787: what, he's cute! kornchick1787: not my first choice, but for a fifty year old, he's in lookin' pretty good.

      Today had all the elements of a TMK television special. You had the rare silence-breaking, you had the stressful chases after calculators, you had the 200-yard cross-school 25-second sprint, you had the desperate rush to beat a pre-school homework deadline imposed by a maniacal precal teacher...  Okay, so it won't make it to production anytime soon, but it was pretty tense. I actually broke a sweat this morning.  As my previous entry suggests (or doesn't), I've been up since 3:30 EST, doing one thing after another. The blatant loss of sleep didn't become apparent until 2:25, five minutes from the end of math, while prestudying for a major test. A test which I soon will put down another study marathon (not like I've not been at it for the last week, but...) for tonight and tomorrow. And I still expect to fail it miserably, even though my problems are well-isolated.  So...Robby shocked me again and qualified third for the 500. Too bad third doesn't count. At least he picked up 3 mph over his practice times, which is really surprising. RCR's in the top six, with Green on the pole. So...  It's never a good idea to fear being boring, really. If it comes, as it did for me, roll with it. Who knows, maybe the boring aspect of yourself can be found to be interesting by others. It isn't working well for me, but hey...I don't get paid to preach optimistic thinking, especially when I don't follow it.  And it seems that the hit counter sharing continues...my Blogpatrol's all funked up thanks to it, but I can live with it. The password is mine, and the styling is mine as well. Control.  Looks like my would-be WinterHC date didn't even go...so much for feeling bad...It was a Freshman romp, so I heard. What lameness. Valentine went, and according to her it was fun...was she the only junior there or something? *shrugs nonchalantly*  Posts have been edited. Changes impossible to find. Care? Of course not.  Looks like the pep rally crew made it through day one of the Dark Cloud era...

      I may have to get used to posting at 4:40 in the morning...  Once again, I've screwed up and gotten myself grounded. Whether or not my parents are superbluffing remains to be seen, but it looks bad for now... I've been banned from all forms of entertainment (the computer counts to them, but not to me) indefinitely. TCS is...for the moment, out the window. Once I get this sorted out I'll get back to it...this blog...well, I won't let being grounded stop me (although it would be obvious if it did), reasons stated in earlier entries.  It was emotionally draining, that's for sure. My dad wonders why I stopped talking to him...he never seems to consider that it's because there's nothing positive to say in talking to him...Why say something if you'll be yelled at for it? I wouldn't dare, since I've always got something else in my sleeve, so the cycle of father vs. son perpetuates itself. Cat and mouse.  At one point, I wanted to cry. I felt...I don't know how I felt. Empty, I guess. Pretty hopeless. As if my emotions, all of them, were pulled from me and then blown away before my eyes. I wanted to cry, but I realized I knew neither how nor why. It was puzzling.  It seems I've burned every bridge I've had. Most recently, I leaned a little too hard on this one girl (who can remain unnamed), cared a bit too much, and what did she do? Turn on me, and I verbally lashed out at her, effectively ending things. And the parents. I've dropped endless clues of something else in the works, but they aren't buying. There are others, but this is too early in my week to reopen wounds.

      Oy...I just sat down and had a look at my last entry.  I wondered what I was smoking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a racing addict...but that looked like it had me by the collar and was squeezing for my life. So, I'm not going to stop prating on and on about my favorite sport, but I won't do it nearly as much.  Kalin's  urlLink site  looks decent enough, but only on higher resolutions. It looks, quite frankly, horrible, on my 800x600...everything is out of whack...as an indirect hint, Kalin, you may want to resize your site and open your forum in a new window. Just a hint. Not everyone is hooked up with 1024x768...  I wonder how the Snow Ball was...but who could I ask? Yes...  I'm not doing the advice column for this week's edition, but I definitely plan to do some presearch for next week...wait, there won't be one next week, will there? At least not on Monday.

      yeah, missed the first 35 laps, since my dad dragged me out at 1920 hours for a haircut, which took an hour longer than I wanted. But the stuff I did see raised the bar for me. It was damn good.  Six posts ago I predicted DEI would be on top at the end of the Budweiser Shootout. Six posts ago I didn't know half of the DEI freight train wasn't racing tonight. Six posts later, my first racing prediction of 2003 was proven correct.  And it seems I've figured out the thing with the counter. The Blogpatrol one. Well, when BP imploded earlier this week, this dude apparently had my new number, 88 (my first one was 16, and then 92 for Guys' Room)...my counter on his site. Ouch...a little due for a retake, eh? While it lasts, the  urlLink link .  At least the race and the NBA All-star festivities are compensating for what may be another personal gaffe on my part.

      Looks like someone's duplicated my new counter....not the linkage I would have been looking for.  Well, one person does know the identity of the person who asked me to tonight's winter homecoming...but this person's trustworthy, probably in my top three female friends list...but to get that identity, our unnamed friend put me through some unbelievable guesses (mostly because of my equivocation, though)...Guess #1: Sathya...You're kidding, right? She'd probably just as soon castrate or kill me before doing that. Abeeda? No. Plain and simple...nice try, but wrong. Well, it's obvious it wasn't either of those two, and that person will go on, with friends, to the Snow Ball. I hope she enjoys herself. I know I will, if last night's Bud Shootout practice is any indication of the race.  Well, I had the night to sleep on that pep rally incident and I've changed my opinion. They damn well knew what they were facing, and the consequences fit the bill appropriately. Sympathy? Nope, not anymore. And I guess I'd have to call back on Zach...just a case of mistaken gestures there.  I wanted to do an "advice" column for TCS, as I can't understand why our current "advice" writer hasn't done anything of note since the second edition in December...maybe it's the girlfriend thing...I swear, I might actually be on to doing something funny for once...but we'll see. Might not be good to have two "advice" columnists on the same newspaper. I'd have to work with the  Hounds of Hagan  in my rear-view mirror if I could do that tonight.  Speed Channel is the sheetz...I love it, the racing addict's cure for the common cold. ARCA in just a few, and then the free-for-all around the Bud Shootout this evening.  Added a little promo buzz for TCS on the webmate (the TCS Online backbone) forums...so that may be good.  This is one of those work-heavy weekends I'd like to not encounter again, but I won't for a week since we've got the 4.5 day weekend next time by.  Added a new Lunatic image off to the side of the posts...so there goes the name change. I was hoping to add a new layout this weekend, a simpler one, but that's going on the bunsen burner for a week while I add some other stuff to take with it.  And wth does  O.o.   mean? I'm so out of touch with online lingo...so 1997 with it, (riminy.

       , compensation-for-last-week edition  1. What did you have for breakfast this morning? If you didn't have breakfast, why not? Two waffles...(hey, I was freekin rushed!)  2. What's your favorite cereal? I despise cereal...  3. How often do you eat out? Do you want that to change? Sunny side up, once or twice a month. Sure, but only under microscope-specific circumstances.  4. What do you plan on having for dinner tonight? Got a recipe for that? Not sure yet on both counts.  5. What's your favorite restaurant? Why?  That's a good one...it would have to be the Chinese place by Northlake, as the food there is...gasp...good.

      Poor Sathya...and Andrew, Valentine, and so forth. Caught skipping the pep rally...A referral is imminent. Tsk, tsk.  Especially Sathya, though...it wasn't fun watching Zach "laugh" at her, as I have reason to believe he was skipping as well... A posse of fifteen was out there...but it's not like the pep rally was anything to write to Kansas about, it never is. Kalin and Aileen were there with me this time, and once more the cheerleaders had several close calls in their formations.  Crackhead Zombies = our epiphany squad....no offense, but that's just how it seemed. Looking at them in big picture view, they're not very well coordinated.  Pep Rally edition ends.

      Just when I thought Jacko couldn't be any more Wacko...*rolls eyes in utter consternation*  I couldn't help but enjoy this tidbit from the TCS forums...   urlLink VII: Hacking   My theory is that everything is motivated by fear. We eat because we fear starvation. We breathe because we fear asphyxiation. We don't randomly break glass bottles on the floors of our homes and then walk around with no shoes because we fear slicing our feet into cheese steak meat. Our lives are a balance of fear. You don't steal because you fear punishment, but if you were in fear of starvation, you would probably steal that cheese steak I mentioned earlier (mmmmmmm...). If we lived in a world where it was kill or be killed, those of us alive would have no problem killing. They'd put us in the school gym with a bunch of sharp instruments and those who walked out after half an hour would pass the class. At the deepest core level, everything is motivated by fear.

      Today's been one of those days Mother Nature shat on...just all around grey...not that I'm complaining about the rain, but the cold is what I despise...  Kalin: the link to the DK3 stuff is  urlLink here ...  Watched George Lopez for the second time yesterday...and learned another thing about life...love is based on lies...if you haven't already lied about something to your significant other, you will.   Speed is great...and 50 hours of Daytona TV coverage is, too. Old timer Geoffrey Bodine is on the pole for the Bud Shootout...good for him...well, I'm not going out on a limb to make the prediction, but DEI will be number one (and two, maybe) when the checkered flag drops. I'd like to see Kevin up front, but I don't know...  My 2003 hit counter's been out of it for the last couple of days, so there goes the accuracy visits, but at least there's two in backup...(riminy...

       Only in America ...will you see both a box of Cheez-its (sp?) and a gutted chicken wing in a school water fountain in the same day...only in America...  I was talking to Tommy earlier on AIM about JayJay...he's a friend of a friend, so to speak, about eighteen in age...JayJay has a GF, and neither of them are virgins...The odd part about this, Tommy tells me, is their encounter. Kinky, disgusting, and involves the human excretory organs...You fill in the blanks. No, don't. I'll fill in a little, too. Let's just say that JayJay's girl has her tongue in an odd, dark place... Now  fill in the blanks.  Think of that the next/first time you try French kissing.  *cough*, *cough,*  swump . That was me, this morning, swallowing some Orbit...someone caught me by surprise, and the next thing I know my stomach feels like Winter in the Belly.  SeventhGear reports that the Mayor of Chicago is pushing for a Champ Car race this year, so as to compete with the Indy weekend (Memorial Day)...this is good news, since CART is not banging any doors...and word is that the Champ Cars will return to the streets of  Houston  in 2004...new layout...or even the Houston oval in development (on track for 2005 debut, pardon the pun), which would be even better...  eyes sleepy...nite-nite...

And so goes the fight between CHS and Dunwoody...losers at DW couldn't take a defeat, and we had to go gloating over it...must have been...well...temp link: urlLink ajc.com | High Schools | CHAMBLEE 52, DUNWOODY 51   Looks like my promotion of Blogger may be starting to pay off...Kalin's been converted...well, at least his site has...so Google can start having fun with his update blog...lots of "..."s, I see...

      And so has Comcast, apparently...I've been empowered with a new favorite TV station, Speed...so now I may not be blogging as much as usual... That alone made my day decent, considering how much I've lusted after having Speed...it was stress-free, it seemed, and that leaves me at a slight loss for words...   TCS "What-number-are-we-on-now?"  came out today...I had it yesterday, but the compy was giving me hell, so I couldn't even open the damned document, let alone upload it to the site.

I made some minor changes to the site yesterday, and it took well over an hour for the changes to be noticed...even now they're hard to see...Can I get a (riminy up in here?!

      Single and loving it. Some people, though, go back for more when they retreat back to the heights of singularity, if such a word exists. I honestly don't understand it and won't until the same thing blindsides me. My horoscope is screaming at me, that I should go to the SnowBall...too bad I never made preliminary plans...but hey, c'est la vie.  What could be better than a day without Hagan? Yup. Nice and all, but the flip side shows us a 6.5 page review packet.  Ol' Phil wants Priya to hang around alive so she can trip (ostensibly in high heels) and amuse him...Kristan wants to pimp Priya (not seriously, it's Ryan's idea)...that's too bad for her...but when you're Priya and you hit guys like you blink eyes...that kind of stuff will be said.  I'm out of bloglines, and damn...forgot the Friday Five...oh well..maybe later.

       Alias  Night...Ethan Hawke guest-stars in the episode originally slated to air during the Super Bowl...betta be good, always has been. Tonight, I think I'll tape it.   So, how 'bout Dany Heatley in that All-Star game? Impressive, eh? Five goals (well, four, but NHL scoring counted the shootout) in the most competitive All-Star game I've ever seen...  One thing people should never bet against: The UConn women's team. Not since that NCAA loss to my Fighting Irish in April 2001 have they lost a game, and they made a real mockery of yesterday's Duke game...(finally, at least one Duke team gets theirs!)  A very quiet three days over here...kind of nice, but an odd anomaly as well.

      Time has put me two laps down, but I can work with ten minutes, so here goes.  I woke up at about 9:30, flipped on the telly, tuned to ESPN first, and sat there for a minute, since it was more (tsk, tsk) LeBron stuff...so I turned to CNN...and it's pretty much on from there...I watched for about a minute before running off to go tell my parents, and by then I knew something was wrong...it was like seeing a comet or a meteor on tv...Have you ever seen a 184-foot long, 48-foot wide comet/meteor make to the ground intact? From 40 miles up? Of course not.  Sad, sad.  Yesterday, I watched the 20/20 documentary on Jason Priestley's recovery...it was good to see ol' JP back to the old JP, almost, anyway. I remember that August morning, too, when I heard about his crash on ESPN...I was shocked. And as soon as you could blink, people would say that he was going goofing around, or that JP had no business being in a racecar. The thing people forget is that JP could easily have been anyone else who got in some oil dry. They also forget JP was racing long before his fateful stint in the IRL Infiniti Pro Series, the IndyCar minor leagues, if you will. It was a shame, too. JP had a good ride, with Kelley Racing...I thought he might have won a race this year...I guess not.  Well, all this talk of couples and their breakups leaves me sitting pretty, really. If there's a way I could have made myself safer from such defeats, I found it. One thing people don't realize about me when they're around me is that I stay quiet for a reason. I'm far more calculating than people assume me to be, and that acts as a three-edged sword at times.  In November, it wounded me. In December, it vilified me. In January, it vindicated me.  One thing I said a while back is that close-quarters relationships (ie. school and related areas) are usually among the most uncomfortable after completion of the term. That was painfully obvious on Wednesday, and I couldn't help but frown at those events. I got out of that emotional void known as love before someone else could swallow me (or before I could be firmly entrenched in it). I swear, it was like a cliff, and I bit the hand trying to save/kill me. The point is...as a guy with emotions in  neutral, I snicker at former couples, desperately hoping I don't join the ranks of them in time....  which brings me to Formal. This week, I'll have to inform my would-be date that I have something else on Saturday, namely the Bud Shootout. (yeah, please don't say anything, I know...*rolls eyes*). Seriously, there had never been plans on my desk to go, and there aren't any...the chief factor in this is that I know of  no one  among the '04s who's going to the Snow Ball. Not one soul, let alone some allies to keep me occupied. So, it's not like the girl's ugly, soporific, boring, or  too  anything, it's the lack of a supporting cast and an appealing (to me) alternative that will keep me from snowBallin.  Now, if I remember, I'll pull out a little something on the next-gen spacecraft possibly in line to succeed Columbia...of course, these are all concept designs and are likely at least a decade or so away from deployment. What the effect is on the Space Station remains to be determined.

      "Guy," the studio anchor said, "An unprecedented event is about to occur at the Lounge, so say our inside sources. What's the latest?" "Well, Sonia," Guy Leavell, the Third Rock News media correspondent, responded, "it appears that the executive-in-charge here, TMK, has prepared a statement in advance, something that has never been done before. Apparently, it discusses his termination as Web Editor of the Thought Crime Syndicate."  "And we've got live coverage of this waiting for you. Down to the Lounge, where the Lounge CEO is standing by." The camera cut to a live feed of the large Lounge podium (which looks oddly like a couch).  TMK, already at the podium, cleared his throat and began. "I'm sure there are some questions as to the nature of my last petulant announcement concerning the TCS, and there will be a quick answer. 'Not being appreciated' equates to this: the site, for all of the traffic it gets remains, at best, in the obscure sections of the Syndicate. It has always been that way. I believe, however, that the site link should have more attention, preferably more than the "one-line special" on the last page it has now. If it was "more appreciated," the least that could be done would be to enhance its position within the print editions, in order to exploit the best medium for TCS, the Internet. My point is proven in that, even on a distribution day, TCS has managed all of one hit to the site.      "In summation, the site needs more attention. That's all I meant by "not appreciated", no matter how warped it may have sounded. Also, as it relates to my decision on holding off on actually posting the ninth edition, I can say that it was done because of my mercurial nature. I haven't forgotten about last week, and the thought of that gave me sufficient pause not to upload anything with TCS. Pair that with an overall lack of time and server downtime, and what you get is TMK conveniently not able to do anything.        "And now that I can, my status as former editor has me in limbo. Post or not? I'm aware that my replacement has already been selected, and I think a little peace offering can be made. I'll release the password to the WebMate system, so the newbie can go on posting as is. The username: TCSOnline. The password: lovesucks. The URL to log in? Well, whoever that wants it will have to find me online to get it.     "So, if I'm fired-I'm not sure if everything is in place-then fine. Only I'd quit, because the problem with this is people reading too little into what I say. People are bound to feel insulted if they take things here from merely face value. On a similar note, I'd like to remind persons offended by the Lounge CEO to consult the readme at the top right.     "Thank you and I look forward to further concentrating on my duties as Lounge CEO."      The camera returned to a close shot of Guy, caught unawares. "And there you have it, Sonia and people. TMK has confirmed his termination as Internet Editor. I'm headed down for a few questions with the CEO, and we'll be back after this message. You're watching the 'Third Rock News'."  I watched the sun come up in Portland I waved goodbye to all my friends I packed my car and headed to LA I gave away all my loose ends  Somebody said you gotta get away To wanna go back home again I left my universe standing there Holding the hand of my best friend  And it's laughter that I feel when I think of you It's one more dusty rose about to turn I'll see you when I reach New Mexico If I'm in the mood to crash and burn  I wrote a letter that I never mailed I rehearsed a dialogue in my head In case you ever wanted to track me down I'll take my cell phone to bed  And it's laughter that I hear when I close my eyes And it's one more punchline I forgot to learn I call you up when my bottle's dry I'm on my way to crash and burn  Antigone laid across the road And let a mack truck leave her there for dead Just because her lover split the scene Well love might be great but why lose your head  Well, it's laughter that comes up when I cry for you And my heart may break again before it learns And I might be stupid enough to want to fall again Cause I've gotten use to the crash and burn I say I've gotten use to the crash and burn  "Welcome back to the Third Rock News. I'm standing by with Mr. TMK, who apparently wants to have the mic to himself. Take it away." Guy handed TMK the mic.  "Yeah, today was one of the maddeningly undescribable days I've not grown accustomed to. I'm not accustomed to waking up two hours later than usual. I'm not accustomed to arriving at school a half-hour later than usual. I'm not accustomed to being 'fired' from over some comments I made. I'm not accustomed to waiting in chilly 3-31 weather, but then that's okay. I'm not accustomed to having five brackets broken off from my mouth, nor am I accustomed to having orange rubber in there now. That's a Cingular thing, and it's beginning to tell me what my real favorite colors are, the Lounge colors, orange and black. From having been threatened with castration by a girl with five-inch heels to being warned to avoid people I haven't spoken to in weeks, to having three boob-brushes during lunch, I may have seen it all. Those are all things I'm not accustomed to. Nor was I accustomed to a down day in Operation Splat. I'm actually at the point where I'm leaning towards simply calling off A-Week after today. Oh yeah, and as for being fired...yes, this is the point where Sathya's invaluable advice comes into play again. Please, no further questions."  Yeah, that's about it. And, as a show of goodwill...I'm not terminating anyone's blogging rights or altering someone's status here, although if I was three months younger I would have opened the TMK bag of tricks.  Kalin, I edited your last post for a spelling error. Hope you don't mind.  Braves lost. Pooies.

      What's going on with this place?  So spikey with traffic...must be the Abeeda factor from a couple of weeks ago...maybe not.  There was this one blog I've been looking at for the last 26 hours or so. I've seen it not one, two, but three times now from Blogger.com.  And, so I don't have to go into the Lounge to answer your question, El Roacho aka Joe... Well, I just added a new member, and my goal for this blog was to have some semblance of a collaborative thing going. I'm always open to having new members. You, though, continue to troll around here. If you would stop trolling for a set time period, say a week or two, then sure, the Board of Execs would consider you for the Lounge. Until then, the answer is no.  (on a similar front, though)...if any other CHS people want in, leave a message and one of us execs will get back to you within the next day.  TCS is done and ready for distribution. Just not on the website. I'll do it when I feel it's appreciated and all that nice stuff. TCS has, if you're not in on it by now, shed the anagrams. We are all recognizable people in the school's baddest and second-biggest publication, including yours truly. And T35? They're back, but they don't offer MySQL databases. Meaning? No move of TCS Online, unless a miracle content management system presents itself soon.  Kalin: J-Yeh, aka Jimmy, has you dead stomped on the point-counterpoint. I reckon you should give up trying to promote Macs around CHS people, unless one of them happens to be a Board exec here.   And I just typed the word "reckon." I think I'm a NASCAR fan now. Or worse, I'm starting to learn how to speak Southern. Why, wouldn't that be a riot if I, TMK, showed up tomorrow at CHS talking like a redneck...  And...as a tribute to the sorry existence of this blog, I'll periodically break out the  "100 Posts Ago..."  section.   Here goes, Round One. Dear Kazoo,  I'm a moronic imbecile with a funny name. I can't tell the difference between its and it's. Anyway, my problem is, I, uh, found this web blog written by this, uh, pothead who talks to plants and thinks I'm on PMS whenever I call him on it. Then I found the newspaper, which he helps produce. The articles were better than anything I could ever have done, but all I can say is that the website design sucks [sic]. He's hurting my self-esteem, and I'm becoming obsessed with him. I want to show him how I truly feel, but I don't know how. Do you have any advice, Kazoo?  -Schmyler  (edited to be legible)  Schmyler:  (snore, snore...) Uh, what was your question? I'm sorry. You must be one of those moody crossdressers I see every week. Except you, my "friend" have the plant-conversing pot head reference confused, unlike the thinking idiots I come across daily at work. Here's my advice to you, in multiple choice format.  A: Go away and never return.  B: Stop trolling.  C: Jump into the Grand Canyon  D: Kiss my ass.  E: All of the above.   It's your choice. Loser.

      As I said in a comment below the last post, everything is loading. Just a little squished if you're on anything bigger than 800x600 res.   Click, Kalin, on the  [+]  things on the sidebars and you'll see where everything has gone. Remix of Lounge almost complete. We're going to add a new member and stretch out the layout for our big-resolution viewers, and that's it.  Almost compromised Operation Splat yesterday talking with Sathya. She nearly got "her" name out of me, but came up just short. Today begins A-Week, what may wind up being the biggest five days of the campaign. I mean, just to plan for everything else probably requires a couple of weeks. It's not as though no one knows who she is...   urlLink rants of a highschool outcast   A complete sentimentalist, if such a person exists. It's pretty cool, since I can understand and relate to some/most of his issues. This has to be the first blog I've combed the archives for, despite all the linkage I've thrown around the last five months or so.

      Your images don't load because when the page loads they are hidden under those plus thingies.  TCS up n' rollin' for next week! Should be a good one...  AMUG(Atlanta Macintosh Users Group) Maclanta Expo was cool. Went to short 45 minute classes on web design, wireless networking, and 2D Flash. They seemed to know quite a bit plus I got to play around with the new Sony Ericson Bluetooth enabled cellphone. That was awesome. Got a bag full of Mac stuff. It's too bad I already had both the MacWorld and MacAddict for March...  Still having major difficulties with my host trying to get them to tell me my host IP...Idiots...

      I'm stunned. And rather pleased with the recent developments concerning the Prom. It means there is no longer time to waste. (what, were you expecting me to be mad? Even if I was, I wouldn't say so anymore, now would I? They make another odd couple, about as odd as my target in Operation Splat and I do. But hey, I'm not going to name names. You CHS people will have to do some snooping.) It also means I'm dangerously close to retreating to my January self (which isn't entirely a bad thing, unless you're a girlie)  It does, however, raise the all-important issue of what to do about the guy involved here. Gee, he's a member of the Lounge, which, since mid-November, has touted single (and somewhat not looking) guys only for membership. I said, privately, that I would exclude or fire any member who falls into the couple-ish category. We're about to put that pledge to the test. There's an extra wrinkle to the deal, and that's because both of them claim to visit this place. Chess match. At speed.  I find it hard to understand why some people derive pleasure from heckling  on a blog , for crying aloud. I don't care how much you love or hate TMK and the Lounge, but this is just plain stupid. I leave the lines open for comments and criticisms, not for people to derive inane masturbatory pleasure from hanging out. Oh, I know! He wants to be the Lounge drunk. Figures.  If this was the TMK of last November/December/January, I would have said something I'd regret by now. And if it was, I would have said it already, about one of three people, and probably in this post. Fortunately, this is not. I won't be posting here tomorrow while I work on the layout (and avoid my trolls). Those of you in the loop know where my entries will be.  To the newest Lounge drunk: Check where you last left a comment, the below post.

      (entry below)  urlLink    1. What was your most memorable moment from the last week? Oy, don't have one. Nothing is memorable in this mind. 2. What one person touched your life this week? The target of Operation Splat, and maybe someone who thinks I read too much into what she says. 3. How have you helped someone this week? How? Uh, being nice, I suppose. 4. What one thing do you need to get done by this time next week? Lot's of stuff. Restoring my sanity may be one of them. 5. What one thing will you do over the next seven days to make your world a better place? Rework the blog layout sans a message board, since two trolls is one too many. Maybe make some advance prep in anticipation of success in Operation Splat. Oh, you asked for one thing...oops.    RateMyTeachers- urlLink CHS   is on another spike. I surrendered my tote ad to a locker, and I'm going to try to become a trusted admin for some other schools...  I'd like to do the TMK interview thing again, but those things are way too time consuming.  The Men's Warehouse is sending me stuff about Prom outfits...(duh, what else might they mention? Hamburgers?)...I don't even know how they got my address, but I'll have a look at it anyway. Why? Operation Splat continues to move. Not much forward progress today, but I think she's still a conceivable goal.  Saw a sophomore guy looking through a Teen-ish mag in French. Odd? Well, when you consider that he was filling out the "Is He Using You?" questionnaire, I think so. I seriously don't like the guy, one of a select few people, and it's pretty sad if even I can manage to hate you. He  is  gay, but I don't dislike him because of that (that would be shallow, but the thing is the rest of his behavior, which is entirely femalelike). He admitted to it, to a close friend, when he thought no one else was listening. And then when someone asks him if he bats from the other side of the plate, he gives the transsexual-sounding "No" that we're used to. I wish he would admit it and be done with it.  Today had lots of odd moments and quotes, and I'll only be able to recapitulate a few....such as...  "Yeah, that's about the long and short of it!" - Me, after Brandon had just finished talking about guys leaving their crap in toilets. (That in itself is rantworthy, but there's no time to rant).  The cutest couple award went to Lyndsay and Phillip. How sweet, no matter how premeditated it was. (Ha, just kidding. I wonder what her BF was thinking...)  Sathya redefined the term "basketcase" today. Nice headgear, by the way. Might never make it to fashion trend status, but still cool-looking.  Oh, and I removed the message board, for almost obvious reasons. Get ready for another retrofitted layout. It's going to combine the best and worst of TMKvs.World (version 1.0) and this place. It'll be a busy weekend, but we'll see. If it works as it should, this place should be a lot simpler-looking.  I spent a year in the mouth of a whale With a flame and a book of signs You'll never know how hard I've failed Trying to make up for lost time  Once I believed in things unseen I was blinded by the dark Out of the multitude to me He came and broke my heart  When the dust in the field has flown And the youngest of hearts has grown And you doubt you will ever be free Don't bail on me

      (If this doesn't sound conceited, then I don't know what does. Here's an unconventional recap.)  "Let's go down to our man Guy Leavell at the Lunatic Lounge, once again standing by with TMK," the studio anchor said. "Hey, guys!" Guy shouted over the fans crowded at the entrance, waiting for the Lounge's owner to show. "Guy, there's a rumor that something big is about to take place, just in time to interrupt our prime time schedule! What's the latest on that?" the anchorman asked.  "Well, we're not sure, but..." Guy trailed off. "Oh, look! He's here!" The fans quickly went silent as the trademark black Monte Carlo SS pulled up to the silver carpeting protruding from the entrance to the Lounge. The right side door opened and out stepped TMK, to the delight of his (seven) awestruck fans. TMK strolled over to the door, ignoring his fans, where he was stopped by the Third Rock News media correspondent.  "Mr. TMK, do you mind if we have a word or two?" Leavell asked, nodding to the television camera behind him. TMK sneered. "Whatever. Just make it snappy." "Well, TMK, there are rumors you have something big in the works for the Lounge. Care to elaborate on this?" "No." "Uh, okay...the world wants to know. How is TMK?" TMK smirked, somewhat nonplussed by the question. "Restate your question, please." "Your day?" "Ho-hum. It sucked." "Why?" "Do I fuckin' need to tell you?" "Uh, n-n-o-"  "No, I don't, but I'll tell you anyway. We had the Grad tests for social studies today, and I feel bad about that because it was the end of my week of sleeping half an hour. Today, I didn't sleep. I spent it looking over some old car magazines. The old F-1 race coverage had my attention for a while. Before I realized it, I only had twenty minutes to work on 'Schoolhouse Rocked,' so I was pretty mad after that. No more than ten minutes later, I was to discover a serious threat to Operation Splat. I guess some--"   "Wait," Leavell interrupted. "You changed the title of your prom mission?"  TMK's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Yes, I did. I guess I'm starting to see the dark side to my scheme. Once again, I read too much into what was going on, a collaboration between two girlies, and I suddenly stopped. I remember someone saying something about my alter ego suddenly 'flipping a switch' and instantly disliking someone. Well, it didn't happen then, but it seemed like it earlier today. I was mistaken, though, as it wasn't about what I thought it was  at all . So, Splat continues, with no real changes. We fast forward to math, where TMK has about had it with the Hounds of Hagan. I'm about ready to give in, but that can't be done, can it? There's a test tomorrow, and, as predicted, she's assigned a review guide completely different than the ones we've done for homework."   TMK paused to catch his breath. "So, I take it that means you have some studying to do?" Leavell asked, reproaching himself for again asking the obvious question.  "You can answer that one yourself, eh?" TMK knew what Leavell was thinking. "No, it gets worse. Jackson has become God of Computer Science Computers. He's put a remote tracking software program on all of our computers, so he can now see everything we do with the click of a mouse. You know what that means?" TMK moved eye-to-eye with Leavell, causing the young reporter to step back.  "That you won't be able to do entries or surf the net from school?" Leavell squeaked. The fans, who had been silent, roared in laughter. "Yes, Guy. You're right. And if any one of us tries to obstruct his newfound omnipotence, he'll have us written up." "Whoa," Leavell said, not meaning it. "Anything of note on the bus?" "Nope, not really. Everyone's favorite mirage was there..." "Who might he be?" "He? Wrong gender. No further questions with that."  TMK opened the door to the Lounge and put one foot inside. "Wait, Mr. TMK! One more question!" Leavell grabbed the door, preventing TMK from closing it. " What?  What the hell else could you possibly want? I have a business to run, dammit!" TMK snapped. "You hinted yesterday that the Lounge had another hit on it, and that it had been thwarted. Are you still planning on implementing your 'renovations'?"  TMK stepped back out into view of the camera, so he could be seen. "I'll say it again, Guy. Last week stung me, but I realized that there will be more than one bump in the road. I still have plans for TMK vs. the World, but they are on hold for now. This blog answers to exactly  two  people, and one of them is me. The other person...well, let's put it this way. The other person might not be too pleased if I acted unilaterally to close this place." TMK stepped back into the Lounge and shut the door.   It's time for Thunder...not now, of course.  But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell I know right now you can't tell But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see A different side of me I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired I know right now you don't care But soon enough you're gonna think of me And how I used to be...me  I'm talking to myself in public Dodging glances on the train And I know, I know they've all been talking about me I can hear them whisper And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me Out of all the hours thinking Somehow I've lost my mind

      And so The Mac Shac begins the tedious move to PostNuke.  Well, technically it hasn't begun, but I did upload the files and try to set it up. Turns out the IP of my server plus the port number won't cut it for the database host. Keeps timing out during installation...  Everything is down at the moment until I get the email from Doteasy hopefully giving me the right information in order to complete my Postnuke installation. My guess is they will take their time like they do for everything else.  If Hagan gives us homework today...Let's not get gruesome...  Um. Forum? For the Lounge? What for?

      Hmm...long day...not a long entry, and this is just part of it...new links at the bottom..  And right by the comments section, I've added room for a forum. Yes, I know more about forums than this, but this one is simple enough for a blog. Props to CNN's Kevin Sites for the idea.  Science test was easier than I suspected, but certainly not as hard as it was hyped. Bio was supposed to be between 36% and 44% of the test, and we all know it really wasn't. Watch out for SS tomorrow...if you haven't been paying attention (Mr. Atack doesn't count) in HS, get ready for some educated guessing. About the Science test...it was "You know it or you don't" for the residents. I feel sorry for them, really. They've been behind the ball. Many of them have no clue about work and force, although the equations were there. I think some may not even have had a physics course yet, but I'm not sure...Magnets, baby. That's why we are... the creme de la creme, no?  I really don't have much to blog about, except for the annoying little old woman driving an Excursion on 285 today. You know, there are some vehicles women really shouldn't be driving, as are there for men. Guys shouldn't be out driving purple Insights or beige ES300s...accordingly, I don't think frail little women should be out there in Escalades and Excusions because they want to feel "secure". Gimme a break. Sure, they would feel safe, but what about the rest of us?

      Gentlemen, as far as I'm aware, there has  not  been an explosion within the mind. Nice try, though.  Great, two chat box trolls. Most people would be lucky if they had any, and I get twice the irritation. Zonkboard wiped one of the posts, the other is what prompted the first line.  Another stab at shuttering this blog has been deflected.  Hey, look out for the Notre Dame teams. The guys are already in the Sweet 16 and the girlies are within seven minutes of doing the same, this time from an Eleven seed. Not like 2001, where they had Riley and could really challenge, but 2003's looking better than last year, at least.

      Rather uneventful, unless there happens to be a certain coined phrase in your midst. I'll get to that later. There will be no "inevitable reprisals" this time. I'm actually too mellow for that now.  Sidenote: Saddam: despot or...sexpot? You  urlLink decide .  Operation Splat2931 continues to move forward, one day after formally receiving a title. Something's bound to happen soon, but I'm not sure what. (Not that I'd fill you in on it if it does...) Just under a month to go.  The math Grad Test has basically lulled me into disrespecting the entire concept of testing to exit high school. Thus far, the Tests have been  little more than an excuse for a catnap paired with a graded questionnaire . However, the dreaded science Test looms on the horizon.  !Hounds of Hagan! strike back. Sometime last week, I had a "bet" that she'd either pile on the homework or give a test (Sorry, I'm not interested in retreating into some of my lengthier and "mean but not intentionally" entries just to give myself some much-needed self-satisfaction). Waayelll...right on both counts, aren't we, TMK?  I don't feel like elaborating on coined phrases, but whatever it was, it was a joint thing between JC and Phillip, starting after my choice not to explain it and their subsequent surprise at its absence in the dictionaries. It would have been averted if A) the former had paid close attention to the context in which it was used, or B) if I'd bothered to clarify.   As I would like to say about the Lounge, there are two sides to every story. Always. On one hand, I might have explained it had I not been swamped with IMs when I had just ducked out of away status, which made me very irritated. I suppose it's a "me" thing. First I get called on using a word JC's never heard of, where Phillip gets the notion I'm insulting him (see Zonkboard, and then yesterday's Someonelikesyou blurb) or something because he's never heard the word. It was all nice and well until I realized this was a coordinated deal, and at that point...I surrendered with an explanation.  "Palava" (appr. spelling) is a cultural term from Nigeria, meaning "trouble", or in Phillip's case, problem. Yes, this is new information, and yes, I've not been entirely truthful in the last day about it.  So...I had just about cooled off until Phillip's sense of "humor" set in...right after I finished explaining that it was a "family" deal...* ChampCarFan2931: Got it? ChampCarFan2931: Now, fit that into what ever JC fed to you and react accordingly. ipip86: what is your family? the lion king? ...and then...a reference to hakuna matata, which seemed inappropriate at the time.  Yes, so I was then insulted and cooled it before saying something I would later regret (yes, Sathya's invaluable advice is working miracles with this mind of mine).  So, I figured it was over with. (you know, end of the night means end of the debate, right?) It seemed fine, until after lunch, when I decided to approach Sathya about it. Turns out, she already knew. So did much of the magnet lunch.  Someone  went shooting off his mouth. (And attempted to call my error on misusing a word that isn't even in a dictionary.) I wasn't mad; just very bemused. That, however, was before I could figure out how widespread it was, which was on the bus.   I suppose it was like, "Let's put TMK under the microscope and let him explode for our personal entertainment."  Response? Simple. Now that TCS is bound for a rerelease...I figured the  urlLink forum  could do with some "work". That means...Hibernation Mode.  I don't care anymore, really, I'm just stating the facts. I thought it was over with, but it is now in my eyes.  --- *I'm not an IM detective, Dead AIM does auto-logging.

      Well, I'll call this a simulpost since things at the lounge and at TMKvsWorld are pretty much one and the same.  Oh, and did I mention today's English Grad test? I think this is a common sentiment among us juniors, but it was an affront to our intelligence. Sample question:  Which of the following is an opinion? A. The world's most powerful nuclear weapon ever tested was one of a 100-megaton yield, enough to set fire to the entire state of Texas.  B. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber has a radar signature of a bee. C. I think you're a total jackass and you need to die. D. The Earth is 93 million miles from the sun.  Really, if this is all we had to know to exit HS, it's pretty sad.  My GM stuff arrived today...so now I can oogle at my favorite makes, the Chevy and the Saturn. I couldn't get them to send me stuff on the Saturn SC series, but I did hit the SS series from Chevy's Monte Carlo. They're all nice. (speaking of hitting it, Danica Patrick finished third, on the podium, in yesterday's Toyota Atlantic race. Wait, that didn't make sense, did it?)  Whoever it was that sent me the SomeoneLikesYou e-mails from last summer has run out of time. I suspect it was done with a fake e-mail, but I do recall having not one, two, but three leads. The first finger I pointed was at Sathya, and that was a joke. She's way above that. And then at Phillip. And then Dan, who sent me an anonymous e-mail. Of the three, the one in the middle seems most likely to have done it. Even if he didn't do it, I still have it on him for hacking one of my screennames.  My stomach was killing me, from about 8:28 AM to about an hour ago. Lunacy, really. Lunch wouldn't help me. Nothing would, really...  You know what Avril Lavigne looks like when she's screaming/singing?   An angry rat .  I guess it was only a matter of time before [tangents] returned from its inactivity, eh? It's hard to get away from blogging, once you've settled into a groove. Wait, that was a lounge-only reference, wasn't it?  J-Prom update: Operation Splat3129 continues to progress. More movement today, suspecting a possible decision by the end of next week. Or sooner. Or not at all, but things continue to move forward, as stated earlier.  I did a vanity search on Google for "the TMK blog", and I couldn't believe my eyes. One, two, three, four. All of them being my sites. And then links to stuff I posted to in seven, eight, and nine.  I own Google.  I think it's because of all of my links, though...perhaps.  Just as I thought it was going alright I find out I'm wrong, when I thought I was right s'always the same, it's just a shame, that's all I could say day, and you'd say night tell it's black when I know that it's white always the same, it's just a shame, that's all  I could leave but I won't go though my heart might tell me so I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes but why does it always seem to be me looking at you, you looking at me it's always the same, it's just a shame, that's all

      Uh-oh! Someone sound the intruder alarm? There's a new guy in town!   Let's go down to Guy Leavell, standing by with the recently returned TMK. "TMK, it's certainly nice to have you back at the lounge. Where have you been?" Leavell opened. "Well, Guy, I've been on a depression-plagued stint away from the lounge. I moved, for all of nineteen hours, to another place," TMK responded, running his fingers through his hair. "Why did you leave?"  "TMK doesn't need to tell you, but I will say that it was a decision directly stemming from last week's incident." "Are you here to stay?" TMK paused. "Well..." TMK snatched the microphone from Leavell's hands and held it up, a la The Rock. "If you smell what TMK is cooking, yes. If you don't, I'll continue to insult your intelligence." "So you're going to post regularly, TMK?" "That's  Mister  TMK to you, chump." Leavell blushed. "Okay, Mr. TMK, you're going to post regularly?" "Maybe..." "Where does this put your newest project?" "It means TMKvsWorld will still be a primary factor in how I conduct my business here. Things are bound to be simulposted, copied, and the like. I fully intend to make TMKvsWorld every bit as good as The Lounge. " "What is your take on the latest happenings in Iraq?" "How do you guys like your bodybags? Blue or white? Or just the ashes?" "I take it this has something to do with your new Iraq body counter, beneath your logo?" "No further questions." "Are you going to comment on the war this week?" TMK, growing more annoyed, replied, "No further questions." "How about your position on school preparedness for terrorism?" "No further questions, you imbecilic jackass!" "In that case, I guess we'll see your answers soon enough, Mr. TMK." "Damn right."  TMK strolled away, looking for fans to meet and greet. Leavell turned to the camera. "And there you have it, folks. TMK is back, and he is in charge. Back to you in the studio."   You didn't think TMK would disappear, did you?  It took a surprise e-mail to Sathya to change my mind (which is like making George Bush learn something; it's almost impossible to do), and in that message I basically contradicted my weekend self. I'm not going away from the Lounge.    There will be changes, however.  I will make sure to distiguish rumor and innuendo from assumed truth. I will make sure to be 31% mean to everyone, which, on the flip side means 69% nice. All the girlies fit into the 69% category. Equal-op, eh? I will try to be less cynical.  No one would have missed me, and I guess it has been a while since I ruffled someone's "fethers." (yes, intended spelling)  Good luck to all (although we may not need it) on the  Grad tests .  I thought all the Iraqis  urlLink wanted  our help! (*sarcasm drools from mouth*)  Never, over the course of human history, has there been a "humane war." Humane and war in the same sentence is an oxymoron if I ever saw one.

      Well, since it's just me I will go ahead and tell you the site updates I have made today.  The Mac Shac front page got some things moved around to fit tighter and formatting issue were solved. I altered thw two images that link to the merch cafe shop and my personal page, and then I created two more for the "Editor's Weekly Mac Application Picks". I also added a self updating link to "Joy of Tech", a super cool and funny technology and Macintosh related comic.  I also added a future page for "The Ancient Mac Gallery" and created some new sections for the website. Today marks the first "Editor's Weekly Mac App Pick". I chose Fruit Menu 3.0.1 because it rocks as a haxie. I also stuck some screenshots in there.  I typed up a profile for myself and Shyaam is going to send me his. I still need a pic for both of us for the profiles.  Tomorrow the forum moves to Mac Shac server land. Hope it's not a pain to transfer. I will also probably do what I can to get rid of the old forum links on Google... Should be a rough time.  That's all for The Mac Shac Report. TBLL looks much better with it's three column layout. Me and Uzo are true "web junkies"...and good ones at that...

      (Entry posted at  urlLink TMK vs. the World . This is my notification system for entries posted elsewhere. Get used to it.)  I had a lengthy chat with Kalin about it, where he asked me if I was closing this place. I paused, not really sure how to answer. I said, "No, I don't think so." And I still don't plan on closing the lounge. The third paragraph of the entry linked below covers a main reason for this.  If I had a three-strikes rule on this place, I've struck out. I don't want to name who I've gone after, intentionally or not, in the last seven months, and I don't have to. This week's incident is the primary reason for the shutdown of the lounge, although it was planned for a different reason before..  Until next time...

      Sad...I got a card yesterday from Elise, who happened to be on iMood. It stunned me, but at least someone took the time out to say something about it.   Now  am I on vacation.  You are still a whisper on my lips  A feeling at my fingertips  That's pulling at my skin   You leave me when I'm at my worst  Feeling as if I've been cursed  Bitter cold within   Days go by and still I think of you  Days when I couldn't live my life without you  Without you Without you

      I thought giving myself the night to sleep on whatever happened yesterday might have restored my confidence in blogging. Nope. If anything, I came up with more ideas to shutter this lounge in the short term.  I have new, final disclaimer, for all of you to have a look at. I concur completely with every point presented there, as it's right down the middle, on the money. The link is the image. urlLink     Kalin will be the only posting lunatic this weekend, if he does post at all. As you all know, or should know by now (I've only linked to it a half-dozen times now, not counting the link in the title bar).  Apologies issued yesterday, and this time I've finally overstepped my bounds with the power I didn't know I had...It was, as I told JC, poor diction on my part, and on the other count...I don't know. Maybe it was a Friday night mistake trying to talk to her.  So... if you're still interested... urlLink TMKvWorld  is my weekend resort. I'm still making structural modifications (read: template edits) to it, but it is quite functional.  Before I left, I did have a couple of neat photos/images I found online that I wanted to share.  urlLink President Bush and President Hussein having a little fun   urlLink What's  really  happened in Iraq   ...see my new signature above the post...

      Conciliatory statements aren't enough anymore, are they?  No longer.  As I'd said, I did go online to complete part one of my apology. Things went...I don't know. It seemed like there was a misunderstanding from the beginning which seemed resolved, but it (the apology) ended so poorly that I'm not sure what to think anymore. My ears are steaming, a telltale sign of humiliation in my book. I'm rather speechless, and very deflated, and I won't be the same for a good long while. I hope she's happy.  I should have seen this coming. In the last two hours, I've had site visits of 28 minutes, 34 minutes, and 23 minutes, all in consecutive order. And yesterday, a visit with not one, two, three, but twelve pageviews crammed into four minutes, not to mention others of 17 and 24 minutes in duration. I should have seen it coming.  I want to stop blogging. It's taken enough of a toll on me tonight to make me feel an extra thirty years older. I'm depressed. There exists no hope for any of this to be resolved before at least Monday. All over a stupid rumor. However, I'm not going to stop. It just means the TMK we're all used to seeing will wind up looking very, very different when he comes back from renovations.  Imagine that. The mighty TMK. Fallen. And no longer capable of pulling himself out of his hole. This is not December 2002. This is not January 2003. This is the first day of spring, March 21, 2003, and in between the three previous dates, I've gone from defiance to more defiance to surrender. I don't like how I'm feeling, but I can live with it. F-1 Quals beckon.  Not the best of ways to start a blog vacation, is it?   So I'm watching the weather channel And waiting for the storm It's just sugar Just a pill to make me happy I know it may not fix the hinges But at least the door has stopped it's creaking I got friends They're waiting for me to comb out my hair Come outside and join the human race But I don't feel so human Can you make it better for me Can you make me see the light of day Because I got lab coats Who will bring me a panacea While I'm watching the weather channel Waiting for the storm You won't want me Hanging around the birthday pony Even though it's just a game You know we are the same But you're the better faker.

       Girls, Motorbikes, and the End of the Lounge?  (I've never titled a Blogger entry before, so...)  I have not one, but two people to answer to concerning yesterday's entry, which turned out to be one of my recent best. If I told you they were both girls, would you be surprised?   You shouldn't be. Really.  Blindsided earlier this morning by Sathya, blindsided again in the afternoon by Abeeda, by way of Phillip. Let the clarifications begin, first with the latter, and then the former. 1. I would feel like a real moron, addressing someone whose return I can't even guarantee, but I'll do it anyway.  I'm sorry . It was regarded as gossip and I should have explained as much. Well, best of luck to you, whoever you make it to the prom with.  2. Sathya scared the sleep out of me this morning, demanding an explanation for my comments from the same paragraph. She seemed a cross between curious and angry, and that baffled me. Baffled so much that I couldn't even remember what I said in yesterday's post. I don't think I'm going to clarify here, maybe online or something.   I was really shocked to hear it from Fleming, in the afternoon, that I'm a cynic. I find that to be a surprise of...huge...proportions. I have a dry sense of humor? Apparently, I've still been, despite concerted attempts to restrain myself, wearing my emotions on my sleeves. It's like being told you're the polar opposite of what you mean to be. In a sick sense, though, I kind of like it.  Otherwise, today was rather uneventful, in the tangible sense. 1. Progress continues to be made in the Waiting Game. 2. Grad tests loom on Monday. 3. Hounds of Hagan strike back in the form of a test. 4. Long day, new Motorbike game, which I'll be playing shortly.  RMT is losing steam, but so many people already know about it... I guess we're running out of teachers. Or something.  As I've alluded to repeatedly in the last week, I'm  leaving the (boring) lunatic lounge . It's undergoing some minor...renovations. So, as you may or may not know, my entries for tomorrow and Sunday (and beyond, depending on how comfy I am with MT) will be at  urlLink TMK vs. the World . I wish people would leave a comment, but I guess I'm not worthy enough.

       urlLink   , "This is  still  not a special edition" Edition  1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be? Robby Gordon. (maybe, but I'd have to venture down to Hampton in the fall race at AMS to do it)  2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be? What kind of a Friday Five is this? I'd rather live in the 22nd century, providing there haven't been any catastrophic nuclear wars or profligate wastes of our natural resources.  3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be? London.  4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be? I guess Jack Ryan (from Tom Clancy's books) is cool. However, he (the character) might be one of those guys I've even come up with...  5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be? Hmm... J-Lo has a nice face but a huge ass...I wouldn't want to be George Bush, which would mean I'd be the Keebler Elf. If I was Bill Clinton, I'd be entitled to free head from ugly, fat chicks in my office, and I don't really care for that. Well, I think I'll take Mr. Dunlap, our Kittredge principal.

      (insert uninteresting interjection here)  56 teachers now, for RateMyTeachers- urlLink CHS . Not bad. "Octupled" our number of teachers since Sunday. And new  linkage  in the almost-random section and the bottom of the superlinkage...fyi. One more, though. I've shuttered  musings from the guys room  in favor of TMK vs the World, which will be the temporary lunatic lounge for the weekend as I learn MT 2.63.  I had a look back at my other entries from September and January and said, "Wow. What was I thinking?" I guess I've mellowed out considerably, as if I hit a virtual joint or something. Or not. Maybe I just learned to chill.  BBC is tight. I used to tune to Fox News, but the second they start reporting innuendo, it gets annoying. BBC manages to keep it neutral, and we Americans get to see a different viewpoint on  Gulf War II .  Wait...I'm starting to hope that President Hussein does have the NBCs and tries to use them (of course, ineffectively) on us. It would really suck for us if we go in, dominate the war, and discover he didn't have them or had them and never used them. I was reading a discussion about this whole deal earlier...think about it. It would be rather difficult to argue that Hussein planned to attack us with any NBC weapons if he wouldn't use them in self-defense, wouldn't it? Liberate a country, discover it was really defenseless all along. Oy.  And, again, on the CHS Prom, a gender-war argument between the girls (Sathya, Priya, Tabby) and the guys (Kalin, myself) on the bus. I guess Sathya's rather disappointed with our gender for being so apathetic about the prom.  We should go,  she says. And I told her why many of us are hesitating (or at least  my  reason for hesitating). It's called the Waiting Game. What's in it for us? Free "pie"? Of course not. The answer: being dragged around by Gossipy girls in tight outfits for four hours, not including after-party time.   I'm playing it (the Waiting Game) with someone new, and I'd like to think I'm going to wait her into asking me. Yes, cowardly, but for a guy with no concrete plans and an increasing ticket price tag, I see it as my only option (you weren't expecting that, were you?). Guys like Shyaam and Kalin could probably get dates if they tried. Me, if it wasn't for the one lead I had...I'd be completely hapless. Hell, JC could relent and go with Abeeda, although he's got a "counterprom" going. As for the girlies...I have no idea what Sathya's talking about, what with not having a date. I think (and this is a drastic change from the me of late '02) she could have anyone she wants, just at the right price. Except me. She's not hard on the eyes, and she has a befuddlingly bubbly personality. But hey, enough with the compliments.   In the end, I think fencesitting guys like me may wind up going, just with an increased hole in our pockets and maybe without dates. And the girls will continue to Gossip, like they always do. Anyone agreeing to disagree?  I've lost my BlogPatrol stuff. Again. All of it. BP's closing down, all of a sudden, and I'm sad to see it go, but there are other counters out there. Just none with all of my 2003 visitors.  Newsy bits  urlLink Yahoo! News - Negative Views of U.S. Are Increasing in Europe, Poll Finds    urlLink Anti-War Activist Sheryl Crow Entertained Troops in Bosnia  It's a month old, but I figured a little snooping might help clarify a few things for me. This is like the Newsweek article in this week's edition. Bosnia was a demonstrated and obvious threat, and I don't remember opposing that. "Half-measures", on the other hand, have been used to justify Iraq. Like France, I don't think Iraq and the inspections were given enough time, and don't give me the 12-year bullshit line. Anyway, about Sheryl, the Clinton Administration may have been assertive, but it didn't scare, did it? The Bush Administration has been just the opposite. Enough on that.

      It 's rather depressing, being deliberately kept in the dark about today's events in  Gulf War II: The Revenge . How? The administration has asked the teachers to not have any televisions on tuned to the news, effectively keeping us in the dark as I said. Talk of  GW:II  has been muted up to now, and it really doesn't surprise me. I suppose it's a good sign. So, from what I gather, Iraq's oil fields are ablaze. Well, some of them. Saddam is...alive? Minor offensives continue as a prelude to the major campaign. If I wasn't kept so deep in the dark, I might know a little more.  How depressing. Another year, another war. Now that it's begun, I hope this turns into Afghanistan 2001 and not the Afghanistan of the 1980s, if you catch my drift.  I'm going to try to keep my war-related posts to a minimum for now.

       urlLink President Bush Announces Military Strikes (washingtonpost.com)   Transcript.  Well, reading between the lines, we're going to be in for a more costly conflict than anticipated, so probably more than the $80 billion tag being floated. What's worse, he   didn't mention any specifics  in terms of costs. Of the 35 countries mentioned, only four or so will provide actual military aid on the battlefields (or in the cities).  I had a hunch something would go down tonight (see Monday's main entry) as soon as the Useless Deadline passed, and President Bush proved me right. (Sorry if that sounded pretentious, but it's true.) Unfortunately, not to sound like Miss Cleo, I don't think it's over yet. Terrorists, and the public in general, have yet to touch on youth in the crosshairs. Watch out, schools. We may be next. It would make perfect sense, would it not? Strike America where it hurts most, eh? Hopefully not. That's just my suspicion. Don't try me for Stupid Spoken Offense 31X if I'm wrong, though.  At least at CHS, it would be easy. Disable the two or so gun-carrying officials, capture the administrative offices, seal off the exits, and the school is yours.   So, welcome to the War Wagon, America. What meal would you like first? We're well stocked in Freedom fries and decapitated heads, which have been gaining in popularity as of late.

      Hmm.  When people you know have a waistline as large as your upper torso are making special notes to buy Prom tickets, you know there's a problem. Speaking of Prom problems, blame them on Phillip. Luckily for Dan, Valentine, and Cherian, it didn't get as bad as it once thought, I suppose.  Yes, my CHS peeps. When we had the little protest a couple of weeks ago, I said that the people that count don't care about what you have to say. And they don't. The war has already begun, people. According this  urlLink this  article, Alliance of Four planes are already preemptively removing potential threats. I hope you enjoyed wasting thirty minutes and TV time with your pathetic (and useless) protests.   urlLink CNN.com - Wartime paint job for Opera House - Mar. 18, 2003   Just wait. While ads with her voice advising Iraqi civilians to avoid military targets play in Iraq, people aross the Ponds are starting to hand it to Sheryl Crow just like they did the Dixie Chicks. Rather sad, isn't it? All of a sudden, there are  wrong  opinions. Sure, I'm stating the obvious, but it wasn't this way a mere year ago, was it? I was listening to the Royal Treatment on Monday, and there was this one lady who called in, saying that "anyone who doesn't support President Bush should get out of the country." How ignorant is that? Well, just because I: don't like the man, think his ears are funny-looking, and think he's stomping over an international body his (our) country spent so long building up doesn't really mean I should leave. But if I do, look out London.  I closed DreamWorld.  Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof In the paper today tales of war and of waste But you turn right over to the T.V. page  Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief  Hey now, hey now Don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now When the world comes in They come, they come To build a wall between us Don't ever let them win

And please don't come back here looking for the links to DP's FHM layout. It's  urlLink here .  Next event is only Five days away...five days to the debuts of AJ Allmendinger and CART's newest bad girl, Danica Patrick,  in Toyota Atlantics ...why Toyota still sponsors a AAA Champ Car division Pook doesn't even care about is beyond me, but I guess that's cool. They'll be back in 2005, I bet. CART should let them back in, but not Honda. Honda can rot in TG's Brickyard for an extra year before coming back.   And of course, there's the rumors of Alex Yoong, F-1's number one backmarker, being on "standby" for the weekend's race.

      I guess I do have a little to speak of, from yesterday's broken recess and today. It's a long entry by my recent standards, and I've done nothing to alleviate the boring part of my style. Sorry. Now, if you'll get me a Pepsi, I'll begin.  "No, I won't go to the circus with you, Barney!" - Me, after waking up from a catnap in French (I woke up at 330 hours this morning and have been awake ever since). At least I'm told that's what I said.  Lots of new teachers on the CHS  urlLink RateMyTeachers  site. We're now up to 45 teachers, and a boatload of ratings. Hell, we've even got a pair substitute teachers in the ratings. (IF you know the first names of that old knitting lady and Mr. Burns, flag the message so the admin can fix it.) I have to give a lot of credit to the Lounge patrons for at least getting the site off the ground.  I was going over a scenario that came up in French (Sathya had a  real  hard time believing that this wasn't fabricated by me after I asked her about it). For all the ladies out there (inevitably, I'll get no response, but I'll ask anyway):   If I was a guy (and I am, but I'm not "the guy" for the sake of the theoretical situation) and I had an eye for this one girl, would I be wrong to pursue one of the girl's best friends as a means of getting the girl's attention? As in...pardon my unbelievably bad example...someone like Phillip *  wanted Ashley Olsen, for example, but decided to go after Mary-Kate just to make sure Ashley noticed him...are we on a comparable wavelength? (I would hope so.)  Would it be just bad macking **  if some guy were to follow the example?  Priya thinks so, and so does Sathya. But hey, people will disagree on anything these days, be it over French wine or French kissing. Or whose ball is in whose court (somewhat inside joke)  And Phillip would be quite wrong about me in that case, since I'm still reeling over the last few months and a pair of careless mistakes I've made. In fact, I've only been able to note that the quest for reconciliation in any relationship takes  at least  twice as long as the building stage.  And, on a similar note, I've backed off my stance on the prom. TMK still doesn't plan to go, regardless of whether or not he has a date (for some reason, he's rather optimistic one may show up in the next month..*eyebrows arched with suspicion, smirks*). TMK gets the feeling that he's simply built a powerful shield against being put in another compromising situation of sorts, and that may be why he's been like this all of a sudden.  I guess haircuts come in multiples, when they come. After I resigned my position as head of the TMK Big Hair Commission, I was rather baffled to see yesterday that Aileen had cut her hair short, too. Different, I suppose.  Oh, and what ever happened to our little friend Toni Smith??  * (I would have picked someone other than Phillip if he had quit hounding me about possibly being "the guy" while I tried to ask Priya the same question on the bus...)  ** (Damn if I've ever heard such an odd phrase, props to Andrew for teaching me that in context, around Homecoming 2K2)   And I'm running from my problems I got my funny face painted on And then I'll think of what you said to me And then I'll think of what you did to me I'll think of you and probably laugh And then I'll think of you and probably laugh And then I'll think of you and probably laugh You're the one I'm running from  Damn if I thought that you would change  And my life would stay the same When you don't even care about me Ah no, you don't give a damn  Well things will come and things will go And one thing I know for sure is that You don't give a shit about me And so I'm walking out the door.

Here's my call on when the war begins (and I'll likely be wrong, but who cares?): Wednesday. Forces are in place, and I'll bet it's now costing America money to keep the troops inactive like this.  President Bush(league) is addressing the nation tonight, calling for war to establish peace, as war is, according to him, the only way to establish peace. I did just repeat myself, I know. I had to repeat myself on the basis of questioning American foreign policy, which I have detested for the second full year (wait, that coincides with USA-China 2001, doesn't it?).

      This is certainly Odd..odd with a capital "O"! CHS now has  16  teacher ratings with RMT, and still no knowledge I have of the admin. The only supposition I have there is that the admin must be a reader of this site...and beyond that, I really have no idea.  Want to go into rating CHS teachers? Click  urlLink here .  Just here to announce that I really hate math and that I'll be...doing homework for the rest of today.  New linkage, below the "linkage" section...not blogrolled, this time.  No, seriously...I'm closing the Lunatic Lounge for renovations. Not like tangents (see link in almost-random section), but for the new things idea. I'll be moving in with TMK vs. the World so I can learn and digest Movable Type. Rest assured, my three (okay, four) readers. This move won't occur for at least the next week.  I had no idea SAT registration online could be so tedious!  4:50PM...I've tried really hard for the last couple of weeks to keep my racing-related writing to a minimum, but I'm speechless (but not handless) over the Darlington race. Busch and Craven, toe-to-toe for the last five laps. A grinding, door-banging collision at the checkers. The margin of victory: .002 seconds. Two thousandths. In Champ Cars, that may be a foot-long nose, but in Cup, that's the equivalent of Craven's Pontiac kick-out, all of three inches.   For all of you that think racing is just a bunch of old guys going around in circles, please catch this in the highlight reels and try to tell me that again.

      "Maybe you should get you hand out of your crotch" -Me  I've had a meaningless day. Didn't bother to see the wonderful Wizard of Oz, as if I cared. Not seeing much of the Mobil 1 Sebring endurance race. Formally resigned as head of the TMK Big Hair commission, so now I'm going after something different.  I  did , however, strike up  two  new websites. Bookmarkers, get ready to add and replace.   urlLink TMK One , my first personal website. I took a BlogSkins template, overhauled it, added several new images to it, and repackaged it with my new domain. DreamWorld files from the summer are going to be added there, with a summary-like look to them. I'm working on uploading my manuscripts there, as the MS page exists but links to no manuscripts.   urlLink TMK vs. the World , edition two. Yes, the TMKone blog that once sat above, on the title bar, is no longer that blog. This blog is powered not by Blogger, but by...gasp... Movable Type 2.63 . I'm supremely pleased with it, considering I didn't have to set it up. I've got good log stats, a forum if I want one, several CGI enhancements if I want them, and a whole lot of fun to live in for a while. The one quibble I have with it is, after the MT install, I have 2.4 megs left of the advertised 10 meg. I'll work with it, though.

Check it out; Click on "Ingenuity" under "Liquid Pencils"...  urlLink Liquid Mechanical Pencil   Also, in TMS(or MS, haha) News: I updated the links.

Yes, since it usually gives me a good excuse to babble along on my Cingular. No, in that when I do talk on the phone, I sound like a guy in dire need of Viagra.  2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone? Kalin, and that was on my Cingular.  3. About how many telephones do you have at home? Three and three Cingulars.  4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened? Well, I don't use the phone much, as there was this one telemarketer dude who farted while making a sales pitch to someone he thought was my dad, but was actually me. I laughed at him, hung up, and laughed some more.  5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not? E-mail. It's a place where you can think out what you have to say and not worry as much about saying the wrong thing by accident.

      Gee, thanks for the publicity, Zane.  Cluster-posting is, once again, the preferred style.  When I began today, I could have sworn there was a lightning cloud hanging over me. Math test, progress reports, and any other sudden things. Less than an hour into the day, I'd adopted the Murphy's Law mindset. I'd left my history hw at home, "not" studied for math, as my planned wakeup time of 4:30 was undercut by two entire hours.  And then things got interesting. Or funny. Phys: Johnson's out of the room, next door. Thomas (standing on a chair) and Valentine (hiding behind a closet) hide behind the door on both sides, ostensibly to scare our lovable teacher. Thomas leans over into view, getting Johnson's attention. Meanwhile, behind her, Valentine steps out and wails, "Boo!"  It was pretty sad-sounding, but it  was  funny.  After lunch, I was scurrying on down to math, when I was frozen with disbelief. Someone had just called my name out. I turn, and so it's Aileen. She was hyper, she said. That was obvious. Awesome girl, but I wish she wouldn't scare the crap out of me when I'm headed for a suicide test, issued from a member of the Axis of Evil (see yesterday's post).  Yesterday, on the bus, I went around shutting all the windows. Sure, sounds normal, right? Not when you're in Atlanta, where it happened to be 75 degrees outside. Brandon was the first to reopen the windows, calling me crazy. I shut them again. And then came Sathya. She hadn't seen what happened just before, and opened them again. I pleaded my case to her, being cold and all, right, and she listened. She shut the window. That is, until Siri showed up. After that, it stayed open. Adding insult to that was guy-chaser/guy-killer Priya.  Sathya: "Why do you want the window down?" Me: "Because I'm cold!" Priya: "You weirdo!"  Yes. Only not.

       urlLink SETI@home: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence at home   You know, I didn't think Channel One was useful, except for two reasons:  1. Alexandra Panther. 2.

It's easy to use, the SETI client, so long as you have a dedicated connection to the Net.

      Well, it's time to do a daily recap. Man, is this becoming a chore!  Today certainly wasn't as bad as yesterday, but tomorrow will certainly be worse and more stressful than today or yesterday.  Cluster bombs of text will follow. I'm not into the thought-stream, but you'll see a lot of "..."s and badly attached segments. Sorry.  The real Axis of Evil: Hagan and Hunt.  Rather odd moments from the afternoon...live bumblebee falls into bus, scares crap out of everyone. I was glad Priya wasn't there for it, else she might have had her response laugh (from what I heard, she flipped when a wasp flew in one morning)...hmm...I thought there was more to it than just that...oh, yes...there was the sinusoidal/ Song of Solomon  deal with Phillip, where he thought I had said the former when I actually mentioned the latter, and sounded like he knew exactly what I was referring to. That was yesterday's news...in a sense, though, it was all rather nostalgic...  People can't seem to believe my quest for more hair has failed so miserably thus far. I've been at it since December, with only some minor revisions around the head. December, as in four months ago, December. All I've gotten for it is a very annoying head of hair and a growing loss of hair. Not the Rogaine type, but the kind where you've got so much that stuff simply falls out.   I can't believe I've forgotten the rest of my post. (Censors self). Peace.  Maybe I'm not your perfect kind Maybe I'm not what you had in mind Maybe we're just killing time  You with your silky words And your eyes of green and blue You with your steel beliefs That don't match anything you do It was so much easier before you became you

      "You know what a platonic friend is to a woman?  [It's] Like a dick in a glass case! In case of emergency, break open glass!"  -Chris Rock  Kalin...if you see me on AIM, IM me for the link to the cam blog from the other day...I went back there in CSci and saw that the address disappeared from the site. Big deal. Childish children these days.  More later, is quite right. 7. Strap on Sathya's evil twin backpack (mine) is coming loose, and now I'll have to relearn how to stitch. 8. One little sarcastic remark dumps a load of hot water on me on the bus. "She hates you, too. She just keeps it secret," Kalin said. "No, you can't be serious," I replied, half-joking. "We all know she can't resist me!" "Did you just say that she likes you?" And then the story spills, and if I remembered how to blush, I would have. So now it's an inside joke that Priya thinks I'm sexy. Well, that's too bad for her. And, seriously, if she were to come across this one, I mean no offense when I say if I was out pursuing, sophomores would be out of contention early on. Well, that rattled me badly, and taught me not to make magniloquent remarks about being hot.  Until the day Until the world falls away Until you say there will no more good-byes I see it in your eyes Tomorrow never dies   Darling you won It's no fun Martinis, girls, and guns It's murder on our love affair You bet your life  Every night While you chase every morning die You're not the only spy out there It's so deadly my dear The power of wanting you near

Wednesdays are...(can't find a good insult) wanker-iffic, Thursdays terrible, and Fridays Freekin Unbearable.  Today's been a nightmare from the second I woke up, and could have been substantially worse.  1. Woke up, slammed entire hand in door again (like last week). 2. Nearly missed the bus 3. Got to school, only to realize I didn't really do the math homework, as I did the wrong series of three (1,4,7, etc when it was mults. of 3) and lopped off a little at the end. 4.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - U.S. Says Iran Is Pursuing Nuclear Arms   I've got it (again, since my first attempt at an entry was stupidly erased by Blogger).   Why have one enemy when you can hit up three for the price of one?  I wonder why the Iraqis are still disabling some missiles. This is only serving to make them more defenseless targets for our B-1s, B-2s, and B-52s, not to mention our more conventional air attack capabilities. I get the idea that the Iraqis know this (which might mean they have even more undeclared missiles) and really don't want to do this, or there's something else in the bank waiting for Coalition...wait, that was 1991...American/British/Spanish forces when they storm Baghdad in a few weeks.   urlLink Motherjones.com | News   Hey, let's all oogle and boogle at our President's illustrious military career!

Another international body will disarm Saddam Hussein. So this will remain an international action, it's just the United Nations will have chosen to put itself on the sidelines."   Ouch. So much for sugar-coating.   urlLink CNN.com - Blogging goes mainstream - Mar. 10, 2003

      Man, today's become depressing.  1. UGA suspends Coach Harrick, two other players amidst investigation of academic fraud. No, worse, UGA forfeits Three seed in SEC tournament, and then a virtually guaranteed spot in the NCAAs...Harrick will be fired at the conclusion of the investigation. 2. Champ Car cancels Road America after RA couldn't pay up. Emphasis on the fault landing on RA. Not that Champ Car did something bad, other than disappoint fans. RA and Champ Car had a deal, and RA didn't pay. What's next? IRL in 2004. Uber-gay, but these things happen.  Oy.  The other day I was blog browsing through BlogSnob. Guess what? Saw a blog by a 12 year-old girl. How do I know she's 12? She said so. Hell, she gave her "address." What's worse? The little bitch has a  webcam ! Since when were seventh-graders entitled to webcams?  Anything else, TMK?  Yessir, one more (and a Jak Splat to go, please.). She submitted that webcam thing in a revealing pose (Seventh-grade pornstar wannabes!?! Aarrrggghhh...), no less, to  urlLink Hot Or Not !  You know, the service where you can rate people based on looks, certainly not unlike the newest reality show from ABC.  Are You Hot? Married by America? Joe Millionaire? Who wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?  It really is no wonder why America is the most hated country in the world.  Online diaries are for nerds. Geeks, tramps, hookers, vagrants, retards, blonde boobies, call them what you will. If you have a diary, please get a blog.  I was just about to lighten up on that concept people like to call love, only to realize why I found myself hating it in the first place. I'd like to say to the people who live for that, my apologies. Rather, my sympathies. It's pathetic, really. Or is it, perhaps, that I'm not seeing it as I should? And then...a contradiction.  And if you carry me tonight  I would be strong enough to fight  And when you're weak and can't go on  I'd be the bed you lay upon  And blue is blue  And so am I  Cause I want to be with you tonight  You're not the only one in need

      Hmm...this I can see, but here's my reasoning: 1. Knowledge of the existence of an archive 2. A mass desire of people to see the new stuff 3. Unable to actually find time to actually say so 4. I wish you knew that I wouldn't dare print an issue on my own. Not only do I not have enough support (paper, funds, etc) to do so, I wouldn't even be able  to without enough stuff. It would only have been a suggestive layout in nature...maybe even to make things a little easier for our editor, right?  Well, considering he had been absent from the Lounge for over a month and then returns with a vengeance and a mouthful of venom (regardless of the circumstances), I'm still on leave as Web Editor. Since I'm not needed now, as there's no TCS, forget it. I have other things to do. Besides, it may seem outlandish, but I get the impression I've been fired. Or at least I'm working with a vote of no-confidence.   The forum? You know that no one except the editor, you and myself actually use it...  Translation: Unless I see something new in the way of a change, I'm not working on TCS at all. Plain and simple. I know this site accounts for a significant portion of the hits to TCS, which is why I'm slowly making TCS Online irrelevant for now. JC's diction really put me off this time, and I'm not having it.  Oh, and by the way...I figured out how to do the news sharing thing for TCS Online. All the  relevant  people know the password to access the news.

      Um. Don't get all mad cause I am saying this, but when you think about it you should have asked him first before you asked people to send stuff and then print an issue with it. I understand the site posts. That makes perfect since. The thing about printing an issue on your own without consent is a bit different though. He is just saying that you should have asked him first. After all, he is the founder and editor in chief...  I understand your boredom. Hey, I want to read some new issues too. That doesn't mean I would print an issue without asking the chief editor first, though...  Why are you restricting the forum? Don't we all want to progress and get closer to a new issue?  Look. Please don't fire back at me. I just think it was a strange mix up and that you went just a tad too far. Just inform Solemn Joey next time. I think you had the right idea. It's just you didn't go about it in the right way.

      Well...again, a victim of my own interests and of someone else's paranoia. Being roundly insulted by an editor of a school newspaper wasn't supposed to be part of today's deal.  What was part of the deal was a college fair, which I did go to. What wasn't part of the deal was seeing a wreck that took someone's life in a devastating rollover (in what else but a SUV?). What was part of the deal was listening to the Cup race on radio in the C240. What wasn't part of the deal was coming back here to dispel the notion that I was organizing a coup against a newspaper. What is part of the deal is that now I'm very, very irritated.  What is, what isn't, what difference does it make? Apparently, not much.  TMK to TCS: Big deal. I'm on vacation. Links to it are going off my sites, forum is going into a restrictive mode. In the words of Depeche Mode, Enjoy the Silence.  RCR struggles again at Atlanta. Robby loses three spots in points, but gains two personal points from me because, as a Cingular driver, he's using the same kind of phone I am, that oh-so-nice 6340 i.  Schumi, the world's best paid athlete (at $50 mil from Ferrari), doesn't even make the podium in the first F-1 race of the season Down Under. I was hoping Raikkonen would do it, but he wound up getting a speeding penalty later on. And then Montoya (another former Champ Car Champion) spun while leading, leaving it to DC in his McLaren Mercedes.

      Hey... Chill. Out. Now. It's very simple.  If I wanted to be interim editor, I'd let you know. I obviously just want a little more new content for TCS, and I figured I'd do something about it in the short while. Maybe to keep the fencesitters from forgetting about it, maybe...You don't like that? Fine. If someone told you I wanted more power than what I already have (ie editorial), you've been lied to. Blatantly.   I know you're grounded. That's the...nevermind.  And the one reason for my "insurgency", as you may like to call it: boredom. It's been a month since I've had anything happen of note with it.It's called protecting an investment, as I see it.  Seeing it as the site is not relevant, according to you, once TCS returns, I'll simply put a bookmark on the site and close the book for a little while.  sheesh.

      Uzo, you slimy putz. Don't be such a fiendish cretin. If I wanted you to be interim editor, I'd let you know. All the relevant people know the password to tcs@yahoo anyway, and we've got some copy in there.   At least ask before you try to usurp things you have nothing to do with. Quit being fiendish. I'm grounded; this is not a result of laziness. The only way I'm able to use the computer now is because I'm elsewhere. When my parental units come to their senses the Thought Crime Syndicate will be strong once more. The first issue back will be massive.  Don't do things like this again. Next time I'll have to break your kneecaps.

      Bluetooth is a great technology that I have been following for quite some time now. I remember last year when I first read about it in MacWorld. The back page columnist, who does less formal comments on the Mac universe, was very excited about this new technology.  Bluetooth takes wireless to a new extreme. Wireless is now more than simply calling someone on a cell phone from your car. It is much more than that. As the wired article says, Bluetooth allows Mac users with Sony Ericson phones to actually control their computer with the phone.  The Sony Ericson phones have been the only phones to date(besides the expensive $600 Pocket PC phones) that have been an adequate solution to the business world. Businessmen want more than just cell phones now. They want addressbook contacts, calendars, games, wireless web browsers, mail readers, etc.  Bluetooth has been connecting these phones with Apple's Address Book, iCal, and Mail using iSync for a couple of months now. But even I could not predict this new use for a cell phone. What a great innovation. I would never have dreamed of using a cell phone as a stereo remote or a computer lock.  Bluetooth opens up the world of high tech wireless to networking also. I have seen an ethernet wireless adapter in MacWorld before that allows individual Mac wireless networking. This elliminates the need for costly Airport cards and bus stations. In my case we have one laptop(the iBook) and it is the only computer that needs a wireless connection. If we wanted we could hook it up wirelessly with a D-Link Bluetooth adapter and we wouldn't have to waste money on an Airport Bus Station that we only needed for one computer.  I found a link to a similar article from MacMinute the other day revealing the new Bluetooth features. I was truly amazed to hear of all of this.  Bluetooth IS the future of wireless. All cellphones must adapt to harness this technology or they will be left in the dust. Personally, if I buy a cell phone it will probably be a Sony Ericson(unless other phones get Bluetooth). Now we will see how long it takes for Microsoft to get their hands on this technology and code their own XP app for interacting with Bluetooth phones.  For now, though, the wireless world belongs to Macs. And it feels good...

The old TMK+9 posts will come to this new address:  urlLink tmk vs. the world . New title, I might add, for TMK+9. So, that's my Saturday. Tomorrow, the college fair. Tonight...probably going to hook up with someone for a little tete a tete or something. Maybe.  In the meantime...Kalin, you interested in this?   urlLink Mating a Mac With a Cell Phone   Oh...and another two things. One, the new shoutbox at TMKvsWorld required me to translate German, as the site's German-based. I guess I'm not as rusty as I thought I was.  Two, I was browsing blogger.com and came across a  urlLink page  by someone with the exact same name as Priya. And the similarities don't even end there...I thought that was rather cool.

      And  this  begins the day in review entry.  I've already detailed what went on during the day..now for the afterschool stuff and the meditations. 1. Getting home was hell in an Altoids box. How impressive (sarcasm drools from mouth), when the American motorsport community converges on the atl, that we're stuck with the traffic tie-up of the year.  2. She still hates me? Figures. I see no purpose in losing what few shreds of sanity I have left over it anymore...it's just demoralizing to realize all the progress I thought was being made turned out to be, at best, superficial. And that's the thing. I recall the Frozen Guy, from January, posting about not getting what you want from that gender, and even when you do get it you never notice. It's rather true, too. And I think I'm starting to make myself sick. I know it worked on Kalin.  3. Shameless  urlLink RateMyTeachers  plug...still hate that admin dude or dudette....  4.

Uh, hear me out now Now your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex It could be money, fame, or straight intellect It don't MATTER!

      Today's been...interesting, and started inauspiciously.  I woke up at 515 hours, an hour early, to study math for today's test. I tried to close my room door, so as to not give my parents an impression I was awake so early, but I wound up slamming the door on my hand. That hurt.  On the bus to school, our driver stopped the bus at Chick-Fil-A to take a leak. Not long after, a guy on the bus gets out, with orders to buy something from inside the bovine fast-food joint. What happens? Just as our guy walks in, out walks the bus driver. Result: Referral.  No more than ten minutes later, I get to my locker. What do I find in my locker? My books? Sure, but not just that. I also find a little butterfly in my locker. How in the blue hell it got there is beyond my comprehension, but it was there. So, naturally (although it seemed not so simple to Emily and Sathya), I had to dispose of my little stowaway, and quickly.  And then, a vocab final exam, which was of course very easy. And then a math test, which was of course very hard. I reckon it wasn't impossibly hard, but hard nonetheless. Of the eight, I think I got 5-6 right. Oh, well.  This concludes the computer science entry.

      (nods over at Shalin)...Long time no see, eh? You owe me money. Where is it?*  Hello to the 2003rd patron of the lunatic lounge or whatever you'd like to call this place (yes, we're overlooking 2K, that's planned).  *money may not exist  In between hits 1001 and 1999, I suppose a lot's changed here. Two (I believe) new layouts and a new title, not to mention some new linkage on the sides. I've destroyed, revived, and reinvented myself, although the external aspect of that is hard to see. I found myself under some scrutiny over some of the minor things that tick around here (namely the hit tracker, which I've insisted on dumbing down ever since then, paired with a little less inferential thinking). It doesn't faze me, and I'm even making half an attempt to resolve the problems I've had with people as of late.   Not long ago I decided to go back and revisit some of my recent posts to compare them with my first posts. Seems like I had a mental-emotional reset or something last month, because something seems rather fishy about my recent entries.  Address concludes.  Today had an up, and three major downs. I don't care to elaborate on any of them.  It took me until today to realize I was going to miss the Cup race at Atlanta MS (home of Cingular) if I went to Sunday's college fair. Oh well. At least there's the Speed Channel.  And another thing: black people hate the website alluded to in the previous post. I remember commenting on it a while back, that post being full of derision. Stupid, stupid site. It's like saying "I'm not racist because I've had four (insert ethnicity here) people at my house in the last week." No offense, people, just a tip.   I wrote a letter that I never mailed I rehearsed a dialogue in my head In case you ever wanted to track me down I'll take my cell phone to bed  And it's laughter that I hear when I close my eyes And it's one more punchline I forgot to learn I call you up when my bottle's dry I'm on my way to crash and burn

      So then I, Shalin, say to myself, 'hey, it's been a while since I've posted on Uzo's site!"    And then I get to thinking, just who is this man?  What will come of the Sathya drama, the racing of the cars, the urge to destroy the rules of mathematics, and the veritable smorgasboard of unresolved conflicts that wage veritable bloody genocide within the anterior and posterior soul of this strapping young  urlLink black  man?  I then wrote out a conversation I would like to be on both ends of, which is unrelated to nearly everything.  "Hey!  Long time no see! How are things?" There is a pause. "There is orange and pink and green on my walls.  The limpid branches outside my window are soaked with rain, and there is a small itch on my leg which is driving me crazy with lust to extinguish this desire, to touch my body on a seemingly random spot between my earlobe and my collarbone.  My toenails need clipping, as do my nostril hairs." "Um." "And it's been four hours and twenty-seven minutes since I last used the restroom, which is a good fourty-nine minutes longer than the normal interval, which is very slightly distressing.  This is what constitutes my current 'I,' man.  There is nothing else except that and, more recently, my awareness of you, and my formulation of the words with which to have this conversation." "Oh." "So, how are you, anyway?" "Good." "Very good?" "Indeed."  A site chock-full of such dramatic interludes can be found at  urlLink Unwillingsuburbanite.com

It's a beta beta, it seems, and looks like XP 2003 or something, but hey, when Longhorn (or whatever MS decides to call it at release time) launches, it'll make OS X look like Windows 3.11 for Workgroups.

I did come across one disturbing search query the other day, by the text, "I hate Toni Smith"...It's a shame, learning to hate a woman you had never heard of until two weeks ago and will probably never meet, simply because she isn't as supportive of America as others. Here we go again, people trampling over the basic principles upon which this country was founded simply because of...I don't know why, actually. It's really not fair to her, but since she suddenly  stands out  now, she's an outcast. Sure she has people heading off to the Persian Gulf. Do we think she cares? Of course not, but she has to.

      He's going the distance He's going for speed She's all alone In her time of need Because he's racing and pacing and plotting the course He's fighting and biting and riding on his horse He's going the distance.   Arr...so swamped. For that reason, I'll keep this short.  I had an odd dream the other night. Picture the Junior hall (basically a long path with an exit at one end and a slight turn heading to the gym at the other end with lockers and classrooms along the sides...upstairs area.), and then (if you know) my locker and then Sathya's locker (the lockers are more on the exit side). Got it? Excellent (again, not that I care if you do or not). Now, for the actual dream: It's sometime before school, probably after the 5-minute warning bell. The halls are (surprisingly) mostly empty, except for a few random juniors and sophomores. I'm about to head off to class, but then I pause for a moment to ask Sathya something (I don't remember what). She responds, shuts her locker door, and heads away to class (in the gym direction). Before she goes away completely, the odd part begins. Know the commercial featuring a snack bar but features a guy being asked how his day was? And how he's being chased by a herd of animals? Well, add the herd of animals in, entering from the exit side (which I'm facing). I see the stampede, and turn to run (what else would I do?). Within moments, the stampede reaches me (everyone else has picked up the pace or been trampled) and a rhinoceros picks me up and deposits me on his back. Shocked, I turn around to get my bearings, while trying to settle down.  You would expect me to see little more than zebras, tigers, and a good deal of dust behind me, right?    Wrong. (Not more than ten feet behind me but five feet above me)...Sitting on a queen's royal seat (a la Camelot), which sits atop a huge grey elephant, is, of course, Sathya. Not adorned in anything queenlike or anything, just normal attire.       In any case, she points ahead, and I'm slow to respond. If I wasn't so slow, I  might  have been able to avoid a huge, sharp sword sticking out from the middle of nowhere, just conveniently pointing at my chest.  The result? Instant death...so...Sathya: wonderful person, just not in this particular dream.    You know al Qaeda's having problems when its Number Three shows up looking like a deranged porn star.

      But I would walk 500 miles And I would walk 500 more Just to be the man who walked a 1000 miles To fall down at your door   Point-by-point  coverage for today...  1. I'm a depressing writer? So goes the story from a few months ago. Zonnie came in here asking for the "depressing stuff," turning me beet-red with rage. I had no idea, but I guess I can accept it. Also, FYI, I'm not into morbid retrospection. (you'd know that if you've ever heard of someone named Chopin). Not as much as in the past, anyway.  2. Two months ago, TCS was the more popular of the two school newspapers. Fast forward to 3/2/2003:  TC-What?  Never heard of it. It would figure that if TCS ever gets another edition off the computer, it won't be half as popular, since things are so quickly forgotten by people our age (HS age). In a sense, I feel like I wasted so much time getting a forum and setting up the site. Matter of fact, I'm only still doing the advice column for freewriting (in other words, yes, I'm still composing it, but not posting it)...last I checked, I was on something about a guy who crapped on his tuba and needs to figure out how to confess that he did it.  3.  urlLink RMT  has a little more activity, and someone took over admin powers. As CHS students, I think we should all head over there to make our points heard. Heck, registration isn't even req'd to participate. Seriously, who's the new Admin?  4. Kalin, laugh it up. I'm  losing  hair. It's been going on a couple of weeks now, but that's the deal, I guess. It's not growing out, but regrowing inwards.  5. I'm still laughing at "A Rose Left Uncaptured." Sounds like some crackhead poets got together one night and decided upon that (no personal offense to anyone who actually coined it). This Junior-Senior prom may well have already shot itself in the foot. At least it'll be at the Fox...(not like I'd be going with anyone, unless some miracle presents itself in the next two months)  6. Finally, something that trumps even the mighty iPod. Seen in today's CompUSA ad, the  urlLink Neuros . If only I'd waited to get this...no...perhaps not.  7. I'm missing  Alias  to do this. This week, something about Vaughn's allegiances in question...

      "Mac Shac News" has officially replaced "The Mac Shac Blog". Thanks for the hint about what "blogs" are. haha. : )  I spent 2 hours coding the damn log and just now it seems like it is looking like I want it to. It's a good thing that I had the convo with you about creating your own blog templates. This new layout I made puts those blogskin ones to shame I must say(well, in my opinion). It goes very well with the site's design. I used the basic layout and edited a bunch of code to make blog posts show up. Th archives still don't load images, but at least the log is working correctly.  I decided to use RE_INVIGORATE for my log stats. Thanks for that lead also. It has a very comprehensive and competent stats collector and it doesn't require a link. Very cool service.  I have a TagBoard on the right bar now as well as a HTMLGear Poll. The TagBoard seems to suite what I need best. I altered the code a bit to wrap the text in the box and I changed the button to say "post to board". Neat stuff!  NetNewsWire seems to be happy with it and so am I. Check it out  urlLink here .  Now if I could just get some publicity. I will try posting on random Mac forums and maybe you can suggest some Blogger search tools.   BTW - Used NetNewsWire to post this message

      I had no idea "If you will" was supposed to be a magniloquent term in the 2000s, according to Fleming. I think it was during a discussion about how easy auto racing urlLink  is/isn't  where I pulled out the phrase a couple of times, surprising him, I guess. Well...that's 2000s culture for me.  I restarted TMK+9 yesterday with  urlLink Easyjournal . EJ isn't bad, really. I won't have to worry about customizing the template, since they're all the same. I can actually refer to it as the Xanga replacement, which basically spells the end of the Soporific Insanity experiment.  Say, our Black History show yesterday was pretty good. It was certainly better balanced than in previous years (Shyaam, that means more than just stepping). You had the excellent lipsynching (sp?), you had the jazzy dancing, the stepping that people love. A pretty good show, except for the AV parts, as there was an annoying hum throughout the segments.  LAUNCH seems to suck now.  And it looks like someone opened the books on Ms. Knapp (predictably) and Ms. Landers in the  urlLink RateMyTeachers  page...wasn't me, but the middle-schoolers are listing the CMS teachers (also listed on the RMT network) as well...  You said you a gangsta But you neva pop nuttin You said you a wanksta And you need to stop frontin' You go to the dealership But you neva cop nuttin' You been hustlin a long tyme And you ain't got nuttin

      Links, explanations, and really, really,  really  inside jokes...    urlLink BBC NEWS | Health | Boy 'pregnant' with twin brother  No, no (fights down laughter). This is too much. The title interferes with the article content, which is actually pretty sad. Not what it seems. Really.   urlLink Revealed: How the road to war was paved with lies Intelligence agencies accuse Bush and Blair of distorting and fabricating evidence in rush to war  Again, more of the same. I guess I keep linking to such odd stuff.   urlLink Putin taunts Blair: Is Saddam sitting in a bunker ready to blow the whole place up with WMD?  You have  got  to see the body language between Putin and Blair. The expressions on their faces are really priceless.   urlLink  Yahoo! News - Restaurant Serves Millionth Strangled Duck   Hmm. Well, don't let me tell you about it...   I've been mostly away at my new blog, powered by Dano, the new Google/Pyra (Blogger) app. I've even gotten myself a new e-mail for that blog. When I get done with the logo and some more unique content, I'll post the link. In the meantime, I'll continue copying stuff from there over here (there's not too much difference, other than the positioning of stuff in the posts).   Which is more comforting for you...  1. Lying down on the couch, or stretching out on a recliner? Lying on the couch, or on the carpet, same thing to me. 2. Going barefoot or wearing soft slippers? Socks. 3. Eating ice cream, or pizza? Pizza. 4. Watching on TV...a classic movie or a reality show? I can't stand most reality shows, but I watch them anyway. So... 5. Wearing: blue jeans or sweat pants? Black jeans, blue's fine but not in the same range. 6. A long, soothing bubble bath or a quick, invigorating shower? No shower or bath can drag me out of my eternal stupor, so I'll take the shorter shower. 7. Furniture: leather, or something more on the fuzzy side? Leather. Not like the...nevermind. 8. Soft, classical music, or upbeat rock & roll? Hit me up some rap and rock, but not R&R. Classical used to be my thing, way back in '99, though. 9. Darkness or light? Darkness. 10. Thought-provoking question of the week: You get married, or otherwise begin cohabitating with a significant other. She moves into your place, but brings with them the UGLIEST chair you have ever seen! You really don't want this thing in your home, but SO says it is the most comfy chair she has ever sat in, and no way will they part with it. Do you: grin and bear it, or scheme to get rid of the monstrosity somehow? I'd definitely want to get rid of it if it's as ugly as it seems. However, I'll be in it for the long haul, so I'll try to convince her to hide it someplace one has to make an effort to see it...   "There are no secrets better kept than the secrets that everybody guesses." George Bernard Shaw  That said, guys, don't tell Sathya about the secret! *wink, wink.   Silly juniors. (me included)

      What  was  breaking news (below) and this piece.  urlLink Reuters: Iraqi Prostitutes Back on the Streets After Saddam  Pulled:  Um Jenan used to wear gold jewelry, tight jeans and see-through blouses to attract VIP clients to her apartment in Baghdad -- until the masked men in black packed her into a minibus and drove her away.  When they laid out her body in front of her home the next day, she was dressed in loose-fitting sweat pants and a T-shirt. A banner on the wall above said "God is greatest!."  Beside her lay her severed head.   Hmm. More is coming out about the regime. Sure, prostitution is illegal almost everywhere, but a sudden change in the late 90s makes it a death sentence? I wonder if we Americans started doing that...   Somewhat breaking news out of Atlanta-  Earthquake Strikes City and Surrounding Areas  Yellow journalism at its worst.  Reports are, and we'll be hearing this for a bit, that at 5:00 AM, a  4.9  magnitude earthquake rumbled through Atlanta. No damage has been reported everywhere, but there has been more shaking than a dance club at 2 in the morning.  I was already awake when it happened, as I was hoping to do some math homework. The rumbling came all of a sudden, and I guessed it was an earthquake right away, but I couldn't believe myself. I remained on my bed, seeing it that if the shaking got any worse, I might be thrown off my feet. I thought the sensation was kind of cool, like being in a bumper car rodeo or something.  Scared? No, as I was in bed. Judging by a cursory glance from my window, my house was the only one to get active, although others have chandelier lights on.  Early reports had that the epicenter was somewhere in Missouri, but that simply doesn't seem to be the case, as the USGS is now reporting that it began in northern Alabama.

       4-27-2003  Highlights of The Lounge vs. the California Trolls (and Phillip...I'd almost forgotten about that one), among the most pointless disputes in the history of man, are available in most of the comment boxes below most of the posts on this page, including this one. Ha. Ha. Ha. I think we're winning. Ha.    urlLink    1. What was the last TV show you watched? Winston Cup Bud Pole Qualifying for Fontana, CA on Speed Channel  2. What was the last thing you complained about? How the weather (we'd just had a massive hailstorm and a tornado warning) suddenly went from a cutscene of Twister to a surreal scene from any afternoon day, with the sun shining brighter than usual after the storm.  3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say? Wow. You know, it's been nearly a week. I think it was the prom. Something about Aileen's dress.  4. What was the last thing you threw away? A stack of college letters from places I'd never heard of.  5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited?  urlLink RateMyTeachers.com - CHAMBLEE HIGH SCHOOL Teacher Ratings      news  urlLink That's Racin' | 04/25/2003 | R. Gordon to sub for Franchitti in Indy-Charlotte double  Rubs finally has that Indy ride we've been speculating about! Goodness knows I hate the IRL, but I want Robby to win Indy, if nothing else. He's going to have a really good team behind him this year, so I think he'll do better than last year's 8th place. Party! On a related note, Rubs steps into a new car, since old man Mario Andretti   urlLink demolished   the old one in testing a couple of days ago. It was a sick-looking crash, but Mario walked away, thank goodness. Mr. Harvick is on the Busch series pole at Fontana, but his Cup effort isn't so lucky. He'll be in provisional-land.   urlLink Nick Carter and GP of Americas Kick Off Race Week  You know, Champ Car had it all going and stuff. This race was recently announced as being on CBS, and then they proceed to put this fag/chumpstain/loser/you name it from the BSB, a group of old married guys who still seem to be in the hearts of all the little American girlies. I can't understand those people. They're killing the chick market! We (the rest of us young guys) can't get any because those chumps are stealing our chicks from beneath us. Worse, these chicks are brainwashed when they slip out of our grasp...wait. This was a champ car article, not an excuse to rip the  Backdoor Boys .   More news  urlLink Mercury News | 02/24/2003 | Many see Bush as villain, U.S. embassies report  As you can tell, noting the poll we've set up on the left side here, people agree. Bush Admin. policy: "We're assholes, but we don't particularly care. Wait, are you inferring that you think we're the bad guys? Hmm, let's authorize a spec-ops team to invade your territory to see who the  real  terrorists are. How do you like that?"   urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Officials: 9/11 Was Main Reason for War  This is an infuriating article. So Gulf War II was actually a show of power, not a justified war. September 11, 2001 was actually the perfect excuse to justify (and even then, they couldn't do that well) the Bush Administration's meddling in Middle Eastern affairs.  One of the more telling pullquotes: " The Bush administration wanted to make a statement about its determination to fight terrorism. And officials acknowledge that Saddam had all the requirements to make him, from their standpoint, the perfect target.  Other countries have such weapons, yet the United States did not go to war with them. And though Saddam oppressed and tortured his own people, other tyrants have done the same without incurring U.S. military action. Finally, Saddam had ties to terrorists &#8212; but so have several countries that the United States did not fight.  But Saddam was guilty of all these things and he met another requirement as well &#8212; a prime location, in the heart of the Middle East, between Syria and Iran, two countries the United States wanted to send a message to.  That message: If you collaborate with terrorists, you do so at your own peril.  "  Enough said.   I should have known it would take something like this (another case of trolling and then a sort of "complaint" about my non-bloggage, and then a pair of comments on my two post-prom posts) to get me back blogging again. In the meantime, I've shelved one post and been asked about this blog twice in the last four days in public.  So. I did ask Sathya about how she knew. My outside response to it was a silent, surprised "whooo", but internally, it was "Son of a bitch. Here we go again. Time to think." Think, I did, until I got off the bus. And now I have a solution. She did what she needed to do, now I'm going to do what I  need  to do.  Channel One was pretty good. Of course, Jeff Gordon (no relation to Robby) was the special guest-host, with the ever-appealing  urlLink Alex Panther  (who, I'm afraid, is stuck in a dead end job until she leaves Channel One). We need to see more of this. Who knows, maybe a revolving door of Winston Cup drivers....   Someone commented on this way back in the "day." Not a request, just thought I'd pull this post from memory. (I still agree with my response to it. Ha.)  Originally posted 11/11/2002 (by who else but me?):  You know the saying that kind of goes, "Better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all?"  Whoever came up with that didn't know a damn thing about love.  --- That, my friends, was from Alfred Tennyson's poem 'In Memoriam:21', 1850.  I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most; 'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.     Still clueless, though, that Tennyson.    TMK and crew vs. the California Trolls Update Okay, this is kind of for real: the vx nerve gas missiles are aimed at the vicinity Simi City and LA, California.  If I were you, trolls, I think I'd have to consider not coming here. You just might get bored. Losers. What kind of a moron (or in this case, what kind of morons) would spend time trolling at a  blog ? It's not even a forum! It's me, the supporting cast, and then...the idiot trolls. I don't think I'd be able to lose sleep over you pathetic imbeciles if I tried. Hell, I'd fall asleep wondering about your respective IQs, they're so low. That is, if they know what "IQ" stands for.  I've given you my vitals. I've told you that I'm skinny. If you people are too blind to believe that (which is understandable, as no one from CHS has stepped forward to corroborate -  do you even know what that means?  - my claims. Of course, only little kiddies like you would waste unfathomable amounts of time at a blog which had been quiet for most of the week. If I told you Fleming was smaller than me, you would be too thickheaded to believe me. So believe what you want.  You schmos are an embarrassment to Californians everywhere. Boy, if Robby Gordon (Orange, CA) knew what you were up to, he'd get out of his Cingular Chevy and come down and personally take care of things. (I hope)  And another thing, Schmyler (if that is your real name): If you liked my muffled voice then, get ready to hear more of it. I'm going to be doing some more audio posts in the future.  Fleming and Uzo, meet Gustav and Schmyler. Damn if this wasn't a  World's Weirdest Name  contest. Let me warn you, though. If you mention  anyone  else I speak of here, and I mean  anyone , male or female, I will simply begin deleting posts. And then I'll remove the commenting. I have another blog now and HaloScan still isn't offering new signups, meaning I'd be more than happy to do a little swapwork.

      So much for high-quality posts. News reviews this time. And no, this is  not  by request. It's just the last one I'll be doing for a while (hopefully).  Fleming, you are still missing the point. Still! Don't you think I might have snapped by now if I feared/loathed her? Wrath? Ha. Good one. I'll believe it when I experience it. Prom: Wrong again, my friend. Ask her (well, don't, really), and she could tell you I'd had designs on asking someone else. When no one else knew who the girl was, she knew, Fleming. She knew and said nothing, mostly because I asked her to. Why she didn't say anything about that girl is still beyond me, as is the way she figured out how. (I'll have to ask her about that one day) I have more to say, but I'm pressed for time and could tell you on the bus.  So, not everything in this mind is as it seems. Sure, you have one good point, but there are a good many things you said that  aren't  good points. I think what you're seeing is me almost in a time warp. I've long since moved on from this debate, and I suggest you do the same. This is already becoming painful.    It took all of three nights to have a post-prom nightmare. The ballroom we were at featured a pair of lobby areas, a large dancefloor on the lower level, and  a balcony up above with plenty of viewing room below. During the prom I decided to have one of my many moments of solitude standing at the edge of the balcony, just watching what went on. (booty-dancing, booty-dancing, and more of it, people dancing to one thing when the music encourages something else, king and queen, etc.) In any case, the dream saw an argument, stemming from something Kim had said earlier.   Don't ask me why I'm jumping ahead now, but I'm where I had been, but now my back is to the floor below. There's a heated argument going on between Sathya and me, over what I can't say. Suddenly, there's a massive gust of wind and I tumble off the edge. Time slows down, and I have time to straighten my tux and tie. I look all around me and notice that not one person has noticed I'm falling to my death. And then time returns to normal. I smash my head on a table edge where it actually was (I remember) and die.  As usual. I have a way of dying in the oddest ways in my dreams.    5:30 AM Opinions  (as in, written at 5:30)    urlLink Bush Aides plan late campaign sprint in '04   It sure looks like an audacious gamble, if it pans out. By playing to the collective heart of America by beginning the campaign around September 11, 2004, the Prez is hoping something magical will fall out of the hat and turn into a decisive election victory. The Republican party is also planning to spend an enormous amount of money on a final blitz, totalling nearly $200 million, nearly twice the 2000 election costs.  Seems nice on paper, guys, but watch and wait. While Bush will roll through the primaries, the Dems are being given lots of time to work something out.     urlLink Israeli nukes!   Hello, everyone, wake up and smell the rotting fish! They have been around since the 1960s (I'm telling you this from memory, not from the site), and even the  how  of its (Israel's nuclear weapons program) beginning isn't sure. Rumor has it that the US helped get the program off the ground back then, maybe even supplying a couple of warheads to Israel to learn from.  It's should be no secret that Israel is a Nuclear Nation. If you didn't know that, I'm sorry. It's true.    urlLink Telegraph | News | Rumsfeld calls for regime change in North Korea   No surprise here. Note that President Bush was quiet compared to SecDef Rumsfeld throughout most of the war. Rumsfeld brought up Syria, kept North Korea in the news, and of course smoked Iraq. North Korea...  For one thing, I don't think the Chinese have forgotten the spy plane incident of April-ish 2001, when we  demanded  they let go of our servicemen. We treated them like crap, I expect China to reciprocate in such a case now.  A pull-quote:"An unnamed senior administration official told the New York Times: 'The last thing the Chinese want is a collapse of North Korea that will create a flood of refugees into China and put Western allies on the Chinese border.'"  Yes, and why would communist China assist capitalist America in overthrowing another communist government in North Korea?  It really doesn't add up.  Rumsfeld is the hawk, man. I dislike him more than Bush now.    Back to the grind.

      This post was accidentally deleted. Repost by me, originally from Fleming.  Uzo.  The reason i say you   are   so incessantly panting after her still is because any conversation i have with you includes her in it, in some way, no matter how small. And as to the fact that she hates you, ya ok, we both agree, besides, you can't have everyone like you. About prom, to me, the reason you didn't ask her is because of fear of rejection, and also her rebuking you. You want to keep the fragile relationship that you possess now, so therefore skirt her wrath. Your little "logistical excuse" is just a poor cover.  No it's not the same you, but parts of the you that existed 3 or 8 months ago still are part of you. Emotions and feelings aren't like a Big Mac Burger: You can't throw them away any time you feel like. It takes time to get over them. I have asked, recieved, and answered.  Haha, and one last bit. speaking of black and white, the ninth grade saw "project impact theatre" on day, and one of the scenes had a joke where they were in an alternate universe, and the aliens go, " See the white people?" and the other aliens all say, "No, i can't! They all blend into the wall!" Haha i thought that was humourous.

       "Courage is fear that has said its prayers."  -Dorothy Bernard   Blogging by special request  only .  So. Fleming. I'm surprised to hear that you so deeply believe I'm obsessed with her. I never have been and never intend to be. Period. That really is all I need to say, so if you don't believe me, tough nuts. (They're mine. Ha.) I concur with your statement that she still hates me. She's done a great job over the last couple of months of hiding that, it seems, but only  very  recently did it (the feeling) seem to resurface so I could see it. It hasn't stopped me in my latest mission to "restore things", if you will, but it has given me pause.  And besides, Fleming, if I was obsessed with her or something, wouldn't it be logical to have asked her to the prom? I didn't and explicitly declared I would not, deciding to instead  continue (read: already doing) focusing on someone else. Duh.    Times have changed , schmo. Get with it. This isn't the same "me" as the one from three or eight months ago. *Sorry about being so harsh, but this is a harsh reality in my world. "Ask and ye shall receive."  You know, speaking of black and white... On the topic of being fired (and I'll pull every stereotype in the book): White people: "I'm quitting in exactly two weeks. I hope you can find a replacement for me." Black people: "Hey yo, let me holler at ya'll. Fuck each and every last one of you."   -Question: "New job?"   -Answer: "Damn right I got a new job."

      That (the audio post below) was the prom for me. Boredom/fun percentage: 88. Fun %: 12." Certainty that I needed a date" %:  100 .  I remember mentioning  urlLink Audioblogger  when the service came online and I wondered how best to use it. Well, that was my one strike.  So. I brought me but left TMK behind. I realized that at 5:40. And it really wasn't anything I could do something about. The rest of the night basically followed an expected course, now that I think about it.  Some funny moments. But first, a  self-reminder  about blogging: "you had to be there" moments do not make for good material. 1. I was headed down from the balcony. I pass JC and Sathya, who I think were headed up to the balcony. JC nags me about asking Hagan to dance, and that was kind of funny. For him. For me, that was just one of a dozen bad puns I will never forget. Anyway, I pass a small window on my way down, and to my surprise, two people are having a passionate tryst on a bench. I found it funny, so I called the two of them over.   JC looks, pauses, and then yells in agony, "Oh  shit ! It's Donald!" I lean in for a closer look. It was true. Kristina had returned, and here they were, going at it on a bench. All three of us groaned and moved away from the window.  2. At dinner, JC remarks that none of us said grace or anything. He does it, to the tune of "....(blah, blah, blah)...if you're listening, I want my soup!" (or something like that) A second later, the soup appears. JC looks to the heavens with an enlightened expression on his face.  3. Scott jumping up and down on the dancefloor.  4. Hmm. I'm sure there were more. Forgive me. My dead sense of humor is preventing me from pushing all the mundane, boring tidbits out of my mind. 4.5. I signed on to Trillian at 1:30 AM, and I had  four  people asking me how it went. Yeah.  After a couple of minutes alone this morning, I guess I'm still the villain around here. You know what? Despite the pain that causes me, I can live with it. In a little while, I'll even get to like it. But then again...  So long, suckers.    I dreamt of something last night in my sleep; I saw you sitting in a room without me; You were smiling and you had a tattoo; I'm me, in a room without you.  I aim my kettle at you ready or not; You're gonna feel my pain, like it or not; You've got your debts to pay and you wanna alot You're down and out of time.  And there is something I wanted to say: I bent the rhythm I forgot how to play; I wanna tell you that I've called off the dogs, 'cuz your mystery is not worth any soul.

U TRY WAY TO HARD AND U HAVE A HUNCH BACK " "hubert u need to take it easy on the uniform,and chains are style not weapons!!! " Yikes.  Sure, Kalin. That's why I have that other blog, but TMKvWorld is a role blog, although I might change that. My new blog, the URL to which I'll release soon, is having some technical glitches. Guess what? It's a Blogspot blog, not MT.   Now, to business. A second post from the guy that hates his blog today doesn't mean he'll be back; he's just clearing the air after a dump truck drove by it. Below, a chat and then a snippet. Further below, a  prom preview .  RacingFan2931: ooze RacingFan2931: dude. who lives on your old sn? ChampCarFan2931: like who? RacingFan2931: some Kuli Namen dude RacingFan2931: german translation? ChampCarFan2931: yeah RacingFan2931: sucks ChampCarFan2931: lol ChampCarFan2931: JJ, maybe you should get offline RacingFan2931: yeah. damn, ooze. RacingFan2931: ur buddy list looks like a bunch of fuckin weidos RacingFan2931: *old ChampCarFan2931: old what RacingFan2931: buddy list RacingFan2931: heartheapplause? Sssalien3? lol RacingFan2931: bioorion829? RacingFan2931: shit another one. mrk540s talkin to m ChampCarFan2931: lol  Kalin: suck on that google...funny stuff ChampCarFan2931: yeah. I'll be getting robotic sex queries by monday   "A Rose Left Uncaptured" (2003) Preview  Well, I just got through perusing the  urlLink Houlihan's  menu, and it's...long. I guess the prices will be somewhere up there, but Sathya seems to disagree in that area. Oh well.  I'm actually going to blog during the prom, using my Cingular. It may be good. It may suck colossal ass. We'll see. (and that's not the last time I'll use the word "colossal" in this preview)  I'm  not looking forward to going , let me make that clear. It was a mistake I made at the start of this month. Fuck proms, fuck dancing, fuck courtship and wooing. That said, I'm not backing out. Saturday's prom likely won't be all that much of an experience, unless I can find someone to tag along with. Hopefully it proceeds quickly and ends just as fast.  I have about 7 dream scenarios worked out in my head and about 75 nightmare scenarios in my head, ranging from meeting someone new to connecting with someone I've known a few months and probably should have asked out but didn't, to getting zonked and doing an unprofessional striptease on the limo roof. I've also pictured a tornado at the Fox, in addition to a sudden snowstorm.   Not everything in my head is logical or rational in nature. Not everything in  your  head is logical. The difference between us? I'm the only lunatic crazy enough to say it, bitch.  TMK+ rolls on. As a precursor to the prom, I'm going to predict that it'll suck colossal ass with a robotic dildo. Suck on that, Google.

      If you are planning on creating a new blog may I suggest Movable Type. The best blogs on the net use it. Your TMK vs. World looks the best in my opinion and it looks good in every browser I have tried. I hear MT has good posting options and an easy-to-use in-browser posting system. MT looks professional...  You might also try pMachine (www.pmachine.com). This also looks flexible and useful.  Finally got my server back on track and my mom's office moved into the new office. I love the wood floors. Its good for the rolly chair. Weeeeee!  Over and out.

      Back by popular demand, starring the guy currently typing in computer science while everyone else is playing Quake III.  I decided it would be a good idea not to blog here until my new blog is ready. It isn't, but I figured I'd at least update here.  Things are progressing very poorly for me. -$65 for limo -$50 for ticket -$115 for tuxedo (which, and I'm not one to compliment myself, looks pretty good) -possibly $15-35 for dinner, not sure yet -of course, no date. I guess Pimpius Maximus will just fall back into oblivion.  Had this been April 2, 2003, I would have resolved not to go to the prom and reproached myself for the crazy thought of going. But it isn't, is it? I can't blame Sathya, since I was crazy enough to believe her idea that proms and dances are actually fun. I can only sit here and blame myself.  Crazy materialistic desires.  Now. About blogging. I was asked yesterday, "Why haven't you blogged in so long?" And I responded, "I don't really care much for it."  And I wasn't lying. I don't care much for blogging. I blogged to have fun. Somewhere in the last six months, blogging stopped becoming fun and became a chore. I realized I was ripping apart friendships I barely had my fingers on. I'm not giving up blogs, but when I realized I can't look at the DreamWorld project or my Lounge archives without a pang of pain I said, "Maybe it's time for a new blog." And maybe it's time to cut back on...  Quality, not quantity.  As for  urlLink blogshares ...I've been bought out and bought into. The Lounge had 0 shares available after the first hostile takeover, yesterday. Then that guy sold off his stock, and someone else bought up 3000 shares in the Lounge.  No memes this week. Both of my usuals were extraordinarily sad-looking, so I ignored them. I wouldn't have posted them, anyway, though.

      Unwillingsuburbanite.com is fucked for at least a week, so I will move my day to day posting here until further notice.  Don't you ever wonder how people would react if you just started breaking all their rules?  What if you were going to the CVS to drop off a roll of film or to purchase deoderant, and you took off all your clothing and tried to pay wearing nothing except said deoderant?  How would the man behind the counter react?  Precisely would he be so shocked, especially if it was hot out and he had an equivalent set of equipment under his CVS polo shirt and khakis?  Even something so simple as asking a stranger for their seat when there are more acceptable seats on the Marta bus can really lead to a screaming match, I've learned.  Why do people get so attached to their concept of what is real and what is frightening?  Maybe it's a weird way to live with the lines always blurring in to fuzzy nothing, but I don't see the problem with it as long as one doesn't take on much in the way of stupid duties.  I feel too vague, and this idea that's echoing around in my head feels just too hard to spread.  For a meme to propogate, it must be easy to paraphrase.  But there's so much out there that's absurd by all rational standards, and popular simply because it's popular.  The mortgage, a ball and chain.  Marriage, an arrangement in which a woman leagally can own everything the man does.  Fatherhood, in which you make a smaller and more obnoxious version of yourself who you then have to feed, clothe, house, bathe, educate, and drive around for about seventeen years, putting your life on hold.  Rod Stewart.  Nascar.  Reflexively attending college after highschool, like a damn robot.  I don't think people make their choices based on logic.  I think people follow their hearts and their genitals and their herd of peers and the logical authority figures, regardless of any self-image to the contrary.  Stupid humans.  "humanity i love you because you are always putting the secret of life in your pants and forgetting its there and sitting down on it and because you are always writing poetry in the lap of death humanity i hate you." -e.e. cummings  I don't know how to solve this, but I do know how to exploit it for my own fun.  The problem with such thinking it the way it makes everything look stale as poorly written situation comedy, and I don't know whether such a worldview should be seen as sad or funny or beautiful.  I find that the more I learn about something, the less I know how to feel.  The way I feel nowadays is like when it's summer and the sky is hot and shiny and the grass it hot and wet and the asphalt is boiling and sticky and you don't want to move, you just want to find a pool and swim until the sun sets behind the cool pines and thinking while inside the pool, the suburban meeting place of the barren desert and the oasis, just seems unbearable.  I remember a day once when I was running around with a  girl I liked and we were in a Questionable Neighborhood. A Cadillac with only one remaining window and no windshield drove by and then a hearse drove by all shiny for somebody who wasn't even alive to enjoy it.  And sometimes you just don't know whether the tomb or that one useless window is sadder, a platypus or a dodo more arcane, a train or a poem more useful for moving people.

      Hi there.  I'm in Florida, I'm in South Georgia.  This country is so big, it sometimes seems to go on forever, and then I think of you.  No, not you specifically Uzo, but the royal you.  Y'all.  I remember driving for hours on spring break, the car smelling of bacon and mayonaise from the sandwiches, going down the beach, smelling the salt air which eventually won over the bacon.  I had a happy spring break.  Of course, I come back, and everything I touch either turns in to gold or it explodes and leaves this bloody patina on the furniture. My car clicks instead of starting, my mother's car loses its power steering, then the check engine light comes on my car five minutes after getting it from the garage, and I call the same tow service twice in twelve hours.  My computer demands I reinstall windows, unwillingsuburbanite.com evaporates, Blogger looks funny, my guitar is somehow missing a nut, my shoe lost its sole, the sand scratched five of my favorite CD's to the point of being really bitchy.  But on the bright side, I might be going to college in September.  Bright shiny freedom, like a rustedshiny silver spoon attached to a fishing hook.  Highschool isn't so bad as its made out to be, the overly dramatic are everywhere.  "(riminy", as Uzo so quaintly puts it.  I dunno, guys.  Write.  Read the non-required books.  Make art and love people who are good for you.  Make music, sing, dance, get over yourself, don't fail classes or get in trouble for an unworthy cause.  Beyond that, you'll probably figure it out yourself, go to institutions reflecting something close to your merit unless you're bad at paperwork, and end up battered and bruised by sheer, dumb luck, laying all your carefully-layed plans to waste.  I like to think that such unpredictable tradewinds tend to lead people to interesting places, but I'm not most people, in any sense of the word.  Wish me luck.

You'll cause me no end of nightmares of fat women smothering me in a seat.   Oh, and Kalin, the blog you accessed is mine. Helen just told me to call you a stalker.

      In between getting my head caught in my refrigerator door and picking out a tuxedo for the prom, I think I've had an interesting day.  Using w.bloggar, I actually can do effective simulposting. so here goes.  new layout in construction. it's going to look XP-ish.  Funny dream I had when I woke up. I guess it was a bus thing. Fleming/Ryan was out there on the bus, flirting with the girlies (more of them than usual). He had this note out, addressed to Helen (never seen her before), one of his...friends...for some reason it looked like a CD flipbook. But no, there was another chick, kind of husky, I guess. She said something like "She can read it when she's ready. But you're ready for me," and jumped on him. She smothered the guy with lipstick and aythang. And here he was, writhing in pain and surprise, trying to get her off him. When she finally let go of him, after about 30 hot seconds, he flipped. It was funny. *note: spelling error corrected.  Yeah, so I picked out a tux. It's definitely down the lines of something I'd pick. Massively overpaid for it, though. Thank goodness my dad's checkbook is very flexible. It took me a day to figure out what  corsage  was (not that I'll be giving it to anyone) or how to pronounce it. I still don't know what the hell a  cummerbund  is, either.  Shintzius, though. Talked to Sathya about the limo brigade. "Pimpius Maximus," as the  new  stupid saying goes, is gonna be out at least $65 to be part of it. Why? Because not enough people, like Mr. Ambrose (who apparently opted for a concert and also irked me with his "Deliberately disobeyed me" bullshit) and my target, balked at joining us. And now however many of us going in the Brigade are being forced to pay more.  Yeah, so basically I made a mistake by going after someone for the prom. I discovered that the little game I was playing was exactly that. A game. I had basically turned the opposite sex in my mind into a little code. I nearly cracked it once, and then here I am again, doing it deliberately. I woke up this morning and realized, "(riminy, man, if girls were a video game, you'd still be on Level 1!"  sad.  So I'm amping down the bloggage here. Just another lesson in blogging for me.

      Blogbrowsing.  urlLink Osama's Offerings  Two of the world's most hated men in one of the world's funniest representations. I liked it so much I gave it a one-spot on the superlinkage (as though that counts for much here). Good read.   urlLink Independent   Whoa.

       urlLink So .  I'm mad. What else is new?  Blogging has me by the neck. Isn't it sad when you can say that a hundred blog entries have been entered in a month and a half? That's too many blog entries. Too many blogs. Too much TMK+. That's too much boredom for the  eight  three readers I have.  It's something that happens to me every single morning. I wake up, feeling completely empty. I wonder what I've done with my life. It's devoid of optimism, really. I can't look at things positively, so I look at them with a dash of salt. To make matters worse, I have a blog. My reasons for having a blog are continually called into question, by me, by friends, and by trolls, almost daily. And I throw a smokescreen.  I do it because it's a release , I might say.  It helps me relax.   Wrong, please reenter reason.  I said a week ago that I'd try to reinvent my blogging style. It worked for all of three days, and here I go again, talking nonsense. And I'll probably break off another senseless paragraph if I didn't stop now. So...no, this isn't the end of the Lounge, not after I just put two more hours yesterday into the "new" layout, nor is this the beginning of a slowdown. I finally figured out how to effectively "close" a blog, like  urlLink ph8  did.  And for some odd reason the phrase "Bitch, no." has become one of my favorite phrases. I don't even know where it came from!  As the only (?) dateless guy in the Limo brigade, I nominate myself  "Pimpius Maximus"  for the time being.  So.  I'm mad. What else is new?    Nothing.   a new pair of shoes.

      random dialogue... JayJay: Today's Thursday, right? Me: Yeah. Why you askin'? JayJay: Damn! Me: What? Something I said? JayJay: Naw, man. Spring break's almost over. Me: Bitch, no. (Pause) Me: You aren't joking, are you? (I pause to look at calendar) Me: Shiznit. You're right. I think it's time I started me math and me story. JayJay: ...the fuck are you saying? Me: Uh-oh. I'm talking baby again. Ttyl.  Round Two of  "100 Posts Ago..."  "My balls are in your court?!" -Ben   Well, not really. That came from the bus, where we had to sit through Priya and Sathya debating this guy. Story: guy from another school presumably likes Priya, she likes him. They'd gone out (ostensibly as friends). Guy stopped talking to her online all of a sudden, she's wondering what he's thinking. Now, the ball is in which court? (I'm probably not being as reserved as usual when it comes to the names, but oh well...)   And so goes her argument that his constantly IM-ming her puts the ball in her court, and now his silence takes the ball out of the game entirely. My counter to that was that it was always under his control. He did not have to IM her, meaning it was his decision and his ball to serve, right? Continuing, the ball goes into her court if the consensus (if you count Sathya and myself as the majority) is that he stopped talking to her proactively to see if she would try talking to him. Following? Good. (not that I seriously care if you are or not) The uncomfortable moment came when I inadvertently painted a bad picture of guys in the courtship sense. I hinted that guys aren't usually good-natured unless there was something else to gain. Yeah. Right. I said that to fill in the conversation, only to realize I'd screwed myself again. Why? I was the same good-natured kind of guy (in reference to one female whose name I've already mentioned in this post) I said didn't really exist. At least in the summer I was. I had nothing to gain, just fostering an interest in a friend, but I think the sentiment...hey...that's a good point, TMK...I was bitten by my own sentiment! Whoa. I allowed myself to fall victim to the 'guys-have-an-ulterior-motive-when-it-comes-to-girls' concept. I didn't have one, but everyone thought I had one, and I...the rest is history.

      It's a "return to normalcy", in the words of a certain deceased President.  The old Lounge layout is back, with a few more adjustments. The new nuke-targeting system in the middle column is one of the additions.They might be aimed at Leeds, England next. Or Houston, Texas. Or AOL, AOL. I have a new GeoURL, which shows the closest blogs to where I live and an XML feed, which the Veep alluded to yesterday. Both of those links are in the  powered by  section. So now, in a week, a full-circle tilt in layout. Mine to Blogger to mine again.  America and Britain threw a war, and, thankfully, the Iraqis left their invitations at home.  -looks like a  urlLink possible  smoking gun... - Patriot Act to become  urlLink permanent ? Save us, dems...   "But often they run into our machine guns and we shoot them down like the morons they are."  -Brigadier-General John Kelly - urlLink Source   George Bush's brain has more uses (okay, one more use) than my glasses now. They're rebroken. This time for good, I think. It'll be up to me to finagle a new pair out of my dad's checkbook by the time Prom rolls around. It's what happens when you fumble your glasses down a 16-ft high staircase onto a hardwood floor.    Speaking of throwing a war,  someone  has more on his hands than he bargained for. TMK+ didn't expect the trolls to go to such great lengths on a first strike attempt, but that's not to say that they scare me. I'm surprised they weren't fazed when I deciphered their relative location, although they think they have mine.  Subnote : interesting, isn't it, the measures a troll will go to? Well, as long as I don't have a serious attempt on my privacy, TMK+ rolls on. It's going to be a long campaign, unless they try something stupid or give up first.  And there's more of the trolls than I suspected. The Californians can have Phillip. I'm (for the time being) promoting El Roacho/Joe out of trolldom and back to normal status. We'll see what goes there.

      Stupid trolls. I called a war and they actually had the  guts  stupidity to come, albeit to the wrong house. And they think I'm  fat ! Sounds like a retarded snippet from Phillip's jokebook.  Yeah, long day. Out sightseeing, poppin tags, too. Not like me to do that, but then again, this is a vacation.  I think my  urlLink nation  in NationStates finally has settled down. I kind of like the government I'm running now. Too bad the game's so boring now.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Braves currently suck. ...the Yankees will suck. ...Britney Spears will always suck.  I was singing the praises of the w.Bloggar drafting system yesterday, now I despise it. I lost a page-long prom draft earlier. No matter. Here's the one thing I remember entering in to it. Of course, it was about the limo. ChampCarFan2931: no...probably made too much of it and I let that get me...I guess I'll be the only dateless guy in the brigade, but that can't surprise me Sssalien3: yeah, unless you convince zach to come Sssalien3: then you two can join the 4 dateless girls ChampCarFan2931: Ooh, we'd be  major  pimps! ChampCarFan2931: Who are they?     How interesting (almost): (couldn't snag a permalink, but  urlLink this  is the root page)  Why the best guys are nerds  10.  Stay at home type  Some girls may not see why this is a benefit. They will wonder why anyone could ever want a guy to give them less space. Girls with this mentality have obviously been nerd deprived, and need to continue reading.  9.  Career options  Perhaps the richest nerd in the world said it best, "Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one." Or you could date the cute boy that takes your order at McD's...  8.  Can actually fix things  It's a rule for the average male, when an electronic device stops working, you hit it. Doesn't matter if it's a television, a VCR, a computer, or a radio, you smack it and show that inanimate object who's boss. If this method, doesn't work, you whack it again. Harder, until the parts eventually begin to come off. That'll teach it a lesson! Nerds, on the other hand, generally have some experience with these machines, especially computers, at least enough to check the connection and consider restarting the thing before beating the shit out of it.  7.  Makes other people look stupid  You don't need to worry about your parents making fun of this guy when he's not around. In fact, if your nerd's got a wicked sense of humor, you two will probably making fun of the oblivious things your parents say.  6.  Conversation  He's smart! He knows things! He can comprehend what you say, you can debate with him, and he can give you back clever, funny, or stimulating responses that aren't always limited to, "Huh?," "Whoa, tight...," or "Hey, whatever."  5.  Less likely to insist on the fifties mentality  The nerd is less likely to insist you stay at home all day in an apron, cleaning, playing the perfect mother to all your children, and having dinner ready for him when he gets home from work. Not to say you can't do that, but the nerd is more likely to be willing to lend a hand at whatever job around the house he's ept at, and...get this...be okay with you having your own job!  4.  Sensitive  It takes a strong type of guy to be willing to show tears in front of you, and this guy is more likely to have that strength. Also willing to accept the fact that you have emotions to, and willing to talk either side's over.  3.  Loyal  This can also be attributed to his sensitivity. The nerd is less likely to go out and be a party animal, drink, and then cheat on you. Or just cheat on you, period. Any "pr0n" collections he may have filed on his computer do not count.  2.  No Stanleys  This guy tends not to be the type to go into a violent rage, hit his girl, then run outside in a passionate fit crying "STELLA!!!!" at the top of his lungs and wake the neighbors. The nerd tends to be more of a pacifist, and even if he does have angry fits, you'd probably be able to hold him back with one hand, and finish powdering your nose with the other.  1. They're absolutely ADORKABLE!!!! These guys are smart, sexy, and as cute as anything. Every girl should have one.

       urlLink    1. Sexier (female)...Pamela Anderson or Jennifer Garner? Since I'm a big   urlLink Alias   fan, that has to go to J.G., aka Sydney Bristow.   2. Sexier (male)...Ben Affleck or Matt Damon? Oy, not applicable.  3. The better piano player...Billy Joel or Elton John? They're both sissies.  4. Funnier...David Letterman or Craig Kilborn? Letterman.  5. The dumber cartoon cat...Stimpy (of *Ren & Stimpy*) or Tom (of *Tom & Jerry*)? Stimpy. Nickelodeon is tops, people.  6. A better news anchor...Tom Brokaw or Dan Rather? Rudi Bakhtiar, really. Those two guys need to hurry up and retire.  7. A better TV chef...Emeril Lagasse or Jacques Pepin? TV chefs? Only humans could be so stupid. Emeril. I wish I got $4 mil a year to make food.  8. The trashier talk show host...Maury Povich or Jerry Springer? I really don't watch either of them, but older stuff tells me to go the way of "Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!"  9. The worse fast food burger joint...McDonald's or Burger King? McDonalds. I remember Sathya telling me something about them and being in a hospital. Talk about a way to really kill people. So unhealthy. Not that I mind that, but damn, in a  hospital ?  10. Thought-provoking question of the week: Only a handful of U.S. Presidents have been considered to be *great* Of the following two, which one do you consider to be greater...Franklin D. Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln? Why? Whoa, another good one. I'm going to slot with Honest Abe here. I think he did more in the way of civil rights than FDR, as Roosevelt opted to cover his backside by not stiffing his voters, the ones not in favor of civil rights and the ones who still thought of lynching as a Saturday night special. Lincoln wasn't perfect, though. I mean, he was still somewhat racist, but still "freed" the slaves. FDR wasn't, I think, but he could have done more to help out the minorities, and not just the black people. Remember the internment camps and the Japanese in WWII?  Good questions here.  There's downtime, I see, at the Lounge. The cams are off, the employees are on break, and now it's just the Prez and the Veep hanging out at the Lounge. Actually, it's just the Prez, since he's sitting down here for a quick, relaxed Q&A.  "Ah, poppin tags are we, TMK?" Guy Leavell, the  3RN  reporter embedded in the Lounge asked. "Yeah," I responded. "Three days into spring break 2k3, I think I've gotten some real work done, Guy. Just added a RSS feed, as the Veep mentioned earlier today, but it doesn't seem to be quite up to snuff yet. Now we're going to have a look at some external syndication again, maybe for the MT building I have. Maybe for the Mac Shac. We'll see." "Anything new on Splat?" "Yes, in fact. I've come to the judgement that asking her really wasn't in my best interests. They're a dangerous gender, and I think coughing up an extra $100 for a night on the town is a little steep when I could spare half of it for some new games, where the people aren't going to smack you over the head for saying the wrong thing." Guy laughed. "Yeah, I know the feeling." "You would know the feeling wouldn't you, ya big-chested, thick-lipped chump!" TMK had his turn to laugh. Guy blushed. "Hey!" "Naw, naw, it's all good, Guy. It's perfectly okay if you 'can't get none'. We all have our days. In your case, we all have our  months ." "So, no go for the date?" "No go. Until next week, at least.

      Ignorance is actually  not  bliss. Nightmare comes to mind right now...  Why, I might ask? w.Bloggar. It's an amazing tool, far more capable and easier to use than the Blogger interface. I can edit templates, other posts, and apply MS Word style to posts. For months I'd ignored it, thinking it was too much of a hassle to set up. Not true, I learned.  Go  urlLink here  to get a free  staining of your pants ! It didn't work on me, since I'd already heard about it, but it is  scary ! My heart's just getting back to normal.  And I did exactly as I said I would, a week late. I  updated  the  urlLink TCS site , complete with the non-stories and formatting I usually don't do for average editions. It's likely a case of "too little, far, far too late," though. So there.  Anyone know what happened to Keroppi? Just curious.  It's about time the old Lounge returned, I think. I've gotten to the point where I have a couple of solutions in mind. Oh, wait, that was yesterday, wasn't it? Yeah, I'm actually going to hold on to this layout for a while. It's a change for me, and those of you who've been here since December know that. From the Cingular black and orange to the...white, grey, and blue (with template-modified black)? Some changes, eh?  Spotted Chad at the library. Apparently he has a job there, lucky gun.  Hey, Saddam is lined up for a 2004 presidential  urlLink run . Of course we didn't just believe what I said, did we?

      Oy, this must be the first time a time change has detrimentally affected me. I really do feel like I lost an hour.  Something to consider in student vs. student(s) blogging episodes... Take this blog, from someone at CHS* called  urlLink Masterbasher . See how it behaves? Now, juxtapose that blog with  urlLink this  one. See a familiar cast there? Isn't that sad? Freshmen mudslinging? What's next,  cows pimping in Escalades?    * Not our CHS, by the way.  I've done some stuff with the  urlLink Mac Shac . One news submission and a little dialogue. Kalin's got the forum up and running and really has the site tricked out for members. As far as PostNuke goes, the Student has become the Master. Nice work, Kalin.   urlLink Death  is served for this Japanese fisherman.  If you didn't like the original PATRIOT Act, just wait until its  urlLink sequel .  The early  urlLink frontrunner  in  Gulf War II: Revenge of the Dumbo-Eared Freak ? Not a country.  Not very pleased to hear about a disappointing Science Olympiad result from CHS yesterday. If I read the chart right, we were 22nd best, and several teams we outperformed at Regional had it tuned up for State. We didn't. Too bad, really.  What happens when Ryan Newman has a bad day? This does.   And that was only the  beginning  of it all. After the Alltel 12 car was done crashing, 27 out of the 43 cars in the field for Talladega wound up damaged, but not Robby or Kevin, both of whom wound up in the top ten at the end. Robby may have had engine problems, but his 10th-place drive went to a good  urlLink cause . Kevin survived being hung with 15 laps to go and wound up second and challenging for the win. Surprisingly, after "The Big One," as motorsports enthusiasts like to call it, the racing really got better.   The winner, Earnhardt Jr., really earned the win and my respect, but people everywhere are disputing whether or not his pass with three to go was a legal one (rules stipulate that if you go below an "out-of-bounds" line to gain "position", you will be black-flagged (penalized) for it...Jr. was down below the line). Well, I think it was, and a wise move at that.

       urlLink Blog Ideas  Q: Seriously... Where does the other sock end up? Op: I wish I knew, or else I'd probably have about ten more pairs of socks. I think a bunch of them end up in the hidden part of the dryer and in other garments people wash. I guessed the second because that's happened to me. Wash some socks, wind up finding them when you try to change bedsheets.  Q:An ode to your couch. Op: Dear Couch, I really regret not knowing you very well, since I spend more time with my computer desk chair than you. I hope that doesn't make you jealous. Really, I love your emerald green and all, but you don't offer me as much as my desk chair. Really, Couch, it's not you; it's me.  Q: How good is your penmanship? Op: I've seen worse. I had to reinvent my handwriting three years ago, when I realized it was getting to the point where even I couldn't read it, much less anyone else. It was  print , too, not cursive! In any case, I went square. Everything I write with, as long as it's not scribbled (and it usually is), is line-to-line connected.  Q: How long can I go without a haircut? Op: I just went on the longest run of my life, which was about 12 weeks. You know, most people that grew their hair out that long probably look like cavemen or like a giant armpit. Me? I looked like myself with a small mass of hair. It grew in on itself, so I wound up losing hair daily. That wasn't fun at all.  Q: How long do you think you will live? For some odd reason, I can't see myself living past 2010. I guess I'll find a way to get myself killed before then. Of all the possible methods of death I can foresee, car crash and accidental suicide come to mind first...  Well, that's about it for now. TMK+ rolls on...

       urlLink Jim Moore's Weblog: Home Page  This has some good ops, or at least ops I agree with. His idea of a second superpower has generated some reaction in the blogging community, and his commentary on China's growing geopolitical role is logical and well-presented, I think.   urlLink blingmethod.com :: how a geek gets their bling bling  Ah, killer geek bling. I have no idea where I thought of this, but a search netted this. Geeky, but cool. A different direction from the earlier link.

      well...I've had enough of the Lounge concept...we'll soon be looking for a new theme. soon. yes, maybe a fresh start may add to my problems, but given the CHS vs me problems of late, it may be something to look at. it won't be a marvelous layout, maybe even a generic blogger thing.   urlLink    1. How many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life? Three houses.  2. Which was your favorite and why? The current one, since I can do so much around it. It's so big, really. I can go in the basement and chill, or I can do what I usually do, sit in the loft at the keyboard, or I can chill in the living room with my 50-incher.  3. Do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? Why? Well, I went through one in September '01, and it wasn't so bad. The process of searching for a house is fun, really. I guess I fell in love with almost every house my parents looked at. Hell, when we got this one in the Edge, I was still sure there were others in Southland we hadn't given a second look.  4. What's more important, location or price? Location, but price has to be factored in, too.  5. What features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)? Hos that come instantly at my call, a tennis court, a short track, fully wired surveillance and intercom systems, golf cart escorts  Oh, and the Twenty Minute Miracle worked out. I'm in, people. O.S. means little to me now, seeing it that I've decided on spending a small fortune on JP.  Listening to the Tomorrow Never Dies theme.  Yeah, Kalin....I was wondering who came up with that...someone's gone about misreading things I've said again, I've heard. I joined the  urlLink MS  in Computer Science, so I look forward to joining some interesting discussions. By the way, this is good news. There were guests on TMK...er...TMS...while I was there, three of them to be exact. One problem. I can't complete my registration; the email conf. hasn't arrived yet.   Have your say  -- The War in Iraq  - link courtesy of BlogPoll, from the  urlLink BlogBoard .  I've joined  urlLink BlogShares . It's cool, kind of like a stock market thing. So, naturally, I've invested in a few blogs. Here's one.  urlLink Toby's Political Diary   Adios. It's time for a practice in Blogging ethics.  I've wept for those who suffer long But how I weep for those who've gone Into rooms of grief and questioned wrong But keep on killing It's in the soul to feel such things But weak to watch without speaking Oh what mercy sadness brings If God be willing  There is a train that's heading straight To heaven's gate, to heaven's gate And on the way, child and man, And woman wait, watch and wait For redemption day  Fire rages in the streets And swallows everything it meets It's just an image often seen On television Come leaders, come you men of great Let us hear you pontificate Your many virtues laid to waste And we aren't listening

      Arrggh. Computer science post-  I deleted your (my recent) last post for a reason, JC. I don't like doing that, but it happens from time to time. There's a setting that simply limits what can be seen on the main page. The last X posts, the number of posts for the last X days, and so forth. All admins (I'm the only one here) can do that. I hid the posts as a means of trying to reinvent this place, as I said in the previous posts. I'm no longer interested in perpetuating a pointless debate over why I continue to blog, even though there are several people gunning for me here. If you don't like something I said, you should probably call me on it. If I don't like something you said, I'll either respond nicely or at least declare you unwelcome.  So, don't go rehashing posts that really aren't deleted, JC. Just as a show, I'm going to reenable the posts for a short while. Not. Well, maybe. Maybe over the weekend, but for now this place gets the lean treatment.   (After-lunch update)  This is so frustrating! The sign out by where the prom tickets said..."$50" from March 21 or so to April 5, right? Today is April 4, if I'm not mistaken. No signups accepted. According to Erica, the stuff really ended  yesterday . Do you know how frustrating that is? I had lots of green ready to throw away today, but it looks like I'll have even more to dispense, $25 more to be exact, if I don't find a way to turn this on in the next 20 minutes  Oh, and I've committed one of the biggest blunders in my recent memory by not telling anyone who she is. Only Sathya and Priya know, and people are going to bug them to high heaven trying to figure out who. So, exiting B lunch, I pass Sathya by in the hall.  "Why aren't you telling anybody?"  That was pretty much the sentiment of everyone in B lunch. Mallory, Scott, Chris, Kim, Cherian, you name 'em, they asked. I couldn't give in, although I wanted to. The timing to do it is still off.  Why? Because I'm not sure if this is going to work. I did ask, and I got a noncommittal answer from my vertically-challenged, spectacle-adorned target. It must have been something about the way I asked, as I tied the whole thing to the limo ride and the interaction deal. It was really unplanned, as I strolled with her back to her class. I mentioned it once, and before I knew it, I'd hinted that there was room for her. So, her response was basically "No, but it's not because of you." Next week, I think the real work begins, now that I've crossed the line.  So, the only hint I can give now is that her name begins with an "A."  And the Friday Five will be here in about 3 hours.

      This blog survives another day because of Blogshares.  This blog is also in a sorry state. The real me will be back soon. I'll play nice, as long as certain people refrain from...  You people still don't understand the problem I had with TCS. One, I never took it hostage. I haven't updated it because it's no longer my responsibility, and I have other things to do. Two, I'm blaming the dormancy of TCS for its lack of traffic, not JC. He's somehow caught in the crossfire between my desire and my TCS website. Again, I leave the offer of the archives password on the table.  And to you, Joe: You have absolutely  no  idea what drives me. This blog does not tell  half  the stories that I think I could say. The rest I leave unsaid, simply because I can. I'm surprised you think that what I write here is all that defines me as a person. Grow up? Who's the one who leaves childish comments strewn around my site? I, at least, have learned my lesson. A painful one, but a lesson learned nonetheless. Among other things, you need to check the title of the blog again and stop telling me things I already know and have known for months (4th section).  Simply because you are older than me does not give you the right to downtalk, and it will no longer be tolerated here. Strike three. And it's not because I'm disagreeing with you. Oh, and it is "to", not "too." Well, what goes on here remains here, got it? Good, because I'm no longer willing to debate semantics.   Bah. CHS people, what would you expect? I should have seen this coming, too.

      "The only difference between me and a madman is that I'm not mad."  - Salvador Dali  Just don't go calling me on it without getting the full story. A very special congratulations to two of you. You have set in motion the beginning of the end of the Lunatic Lounge, this time for good. Checking the date, it is not April Fools'. I'm really not sure about what to do next for once, and (for once), I'm speechless to respond.  ...now this is interesting. KaptinArab : Uzo's dissin on Kalin in his blog hear theapplause : that's not nice at all hear theapplause : what an idiot  I do have a selectively large memory, but when was this? (if it was the last entry...see below) Sure, I complain about people. I'm a petulant writer, and I don't need to be nice to everyone. Hell, sometimes when I am being nice/not trying to be mean, people like the other person in this jump me. Welcome to the real world, TMK. [21:04] Sathya: so why DO you publish your thoughts on the internet then? [21:05] ChampCarFan2931: You know, I asked myself that very question some time ago, in the midst of one blog dispute. Why? Because it keeps the thoughts flowing. Had I not started up a blog, I probably wouldn't be able to keep my what little of my sanity I have. [21:06] ChampCarFan2931: ...and... [21:06] Sathya: but on the internet?  You know, good question. Yeah, because it's so easy. Which brings me to the next thing. If I decide to pull something, I'll still blog online. Just in a place none of you know about. Not TMK vs the World, versions one or two, not Xanga, and probably not in another blog. In anticipation of something like this happening, I started up another journal over the weekend. Yeah, everyone, that means I'll get to journal. And hey, maybe I'll link some more CHS blogs around here. I'll start with LiveJournal.  The problem lies in a mass case of misreading what I said. If people like Abeeda or Joe actually paid attention to the interpersonal relationships I have (everything here is done for a reason, not because I feel like it) described here, they would note that Kalin is my best friend and I had no reason to be angry with him. Shallowness kills, a lot like a Lounge poison pill.  So...is this the end? For the third time in two weeks, the answer is not easily defined. If I retired this blog, it wouldn't be solely because of wounded feelings. It would be to get everyone else at CHS off my back.  In the meantime, I'm delinking the archives and readying this place for a new look. A more plain look, and probably a newer TMK. When I reemerge from this, I hope to sound more interesting. For the dwindling numbers of you who still want to stick with me, I request that you consult the disclaimer/readme at the top left. Otherwise, you're bound to be left dazed and wondering.  Again, congratulations. I should have seen this coming.   I had no idea something I said about platonic relationships would get at least (since I don't know how many CHS people gossip and rip this place online) two people into discussion with me. It was Sathya who said it originally, so that's okay. The other guy, whose name I've mentioned at least once in this post, must be a platonic friend to many. Sorry, people, I don't buy the concept of being a platonic friend from the male side. Don't like it? Good. I don't really care. Just don't go calling me on it without getting the full story.

      (a bit incomplete, maybe looking for a continuation at the "other" place later...) O.S. update, 1900 hours. Coulda, woulda, shoulda.  I really don't care much for the allure of going with a date anymore, moreso to go than anything else. Which is why Kalin's refusal to go (Pearl Jam concert) now strikes me as odd. You know, I was on his side a couple of weeks ago. Not going, not planning on going. And then something Sathya said changed my mind, putting me on course for a reality check. The way I see it, if I was in his shoes, is that there will be another concert. There will only be one Junior Prom, even if its title makes me dart to the bathroom. Fast-forwarding to today, she not only knows who it is I covet, there's some give-and-take going on, and I think without her advice I'd be pretty screwed now.  In any case, I have a half day to get the job done, and merely an opportunity or two, not including the actual purchase of tickets (cash, right? anyone?). That's if she hasn't already secured a spot elsewhere.  Me? I'll be lining up a limo ride. And trying to figure out how best to snooker someone in a conversation.    Oh, and would you believe it? The two Lounge trolls had to be together, at the same time. Of course, the idiot among the pair, Gustav (by the way, what kind of a name is that?), thinks I'm fat. And that in itself is worthy of a laugh. You want "fat"? I'll show you "fat!" Chris, where are you? And someone is  still  missing the point.    this week... Robby and the rest of RCR return to Talladega, the cavalcade of speed. I'll look for RG to qualify in at least the top ten, and all three RCR teams in the top fifteen. Kasey Kahne, fifth in Busch points, is on the outside pole for the Busch event, so we're already off to a good start. F-1 returns this weekend, for Brazil. Champ Car has the week off as it preps for its signature race, the Toyota (why they still sponsor it baffles me, as they don't produce engines for Champ Car anymore) Grand Prix of Long Beach. IndyCar is prepping for Twin Ring Motegi in Japan next week, but my bet is that half the teams in the field are really looking beyond this event to...Indy.

      modified the linkage a tad...  You know...O.S. was stupid. I think it's time I created the [somewhat capable] Macking Machine. All things are off the table for the next day, and we'll see what gives.  And someone tell me what it is with CHS girlies and LiveJournal! LJ blows like a F5 tornado... even DeadJournal is garbage. Yeah, I say that because I've always wondered what it would be like to do some lurking of my own on CHS bloggers...and LJ is my first target. Xanga up next, since that's where the Azns (and Zach) seem to be... REmix: Just my luck. Most of these blogs are dead. Tot. Kaput. Mort. Or at least on hiatus.  Wait...the  Macking Machine ? And I'm not mad at someone? I think it's getting rather cold in here. Yes, look at the ice dipping from the ceiling...  Yeah, and over the course of the day I heard a girl mention the phrase "platonic friend." I scoffed at that one, whenever it was that I heard it. Well, in the Rock sense of things, a platonic friend to a woman is "like a dick in a glass case." I happen to agree with him. Come on, guys, you  know  that most of the time when you wind up being a platonic friend you must have taken a wrong turn somewhere in the Macking Zone and wound up in FriendLand. Admit it, guys. We, unfortunately, have no platonic friends in the other gender (unless you happen to be a transsexual or something). There's people you tried to get, there's people that gave you the detour, and there's people that shut the door. Simple. Right? Maybe.

      this will look pretty ragged after the first couple of highlights...  Once you get through the day, you make it to the bus, and things get interesting.  Operation Splat is compromised, thanks to the ever-observant Sathya. Don't ask how she did it, because I haven't said anything that could give myself away. In any case, I'm comfortable with "her" name sitting with someone like her. (We'll put the theory that girlies can't keep secrets to the test, although...nevermind.) Priya, too, but she was hounding me like a cat on rabies or something. Harumph. Well, if I'm going to trigger it, it has to happen Friday or tomorrow, or else I'll be more than happy to go it alone, without a date.  I guess I'm a Ventures Scholar now, whatever that means.  The  urlLink Mac Shac  is back, Jack.  Whoa, only one more day with the Hounds of Hagan, and then...the break.  Ever heard of a November b-day party in April? You might, soon.  I wish my parents would understand that when I'm in the same car as them that when I have my MP3 player on, that means "Do not disturb" and not me saying, "What?" after every pause. So flustrating.  And someone missed the point again in the comments.  If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?

      I am not well known for my sense of humor, nor will I ever be.   April Fools.  It began early, my crapporific day. Early, as in 4AM early.  It continued in the morning, where I found myself extremely annoyed with our newest troll and a couple of other people, although I was probably wrong to get mad at them. Bystanders, I suppose. I must say, though...there's a huge difference between talking about my blogging practices online and talking about them in person. I guess there's been a real emptying of my aggression this year, and this wasn't even one of my New Year's resolutions. If this had happened in December, I would have exploded and gotten myself in trouble.  I mean, I'm not an inherently violent guy. I just have my moments. Doesn't everyone?  Well, thanks, Sathya.  As for our troll, that's his second strike. After three, I'll force him to think of other ways to annoy me. And once we reach that echelon, I don't think  stalking  is too inappropriate a word to use for him. Hell, if I get two people telling me I'm wanted in the real world, then there might be an issue. He's been angling for more stroke over here. Well, any chance he had vanished the second he opened his mouth.  Operation Splat is on hold, again. This time I decided I wasn't ready to throw my emotions all the way into it without a good security backup. I mean, as I told Sathya earlier, I don't think I'd have to worry about a rejection, but am I ready to enter the game of Pursuit? No, but things in my mind are continuously in motion.  Hey: all Hagan math people: do not, I repeat, do not tell her that she has a test scheduled for Friday.  And why must you (I think you know who you are) people hate on Erica? She's not a bad person, once you get to know her.  I've moved my SN back to Trillian. It's been a nice two days thus far, and I can at least modify my profile.  Before I was fired as TCS Internet Editor (remember, there's still an offer of the  WebMate news system password on the table for my successor), I was at work on a beta edition of TCS. It was a news  urlLink portal , courtesy of Blazeboard. What a mistake that was! Blaze has been silent for months and has more bugs than a whorehouse in the middle of Oklahoma. If, in the unlikely event my status is restored, I may still work on a Postnuke-styled thing, but we'll see.  Being TMK on screen is draining, you know that?  New scheds...right now I'm in AP Psych, AP Gov't, and AP ESci, since I'm lazy. As for Lit and Math, joint enrollment will fix those. There is no chance in the  bluest hell  that I'm going to sit in the same room as Knapp for 180 days. (rumor: in the newest round of budget cuts, the school year may be shortened. For more on the cuts, check below the lyrics snapshot.) And now that I wanted the block scheduling, I'm screwed. No French or Creative Writing. Psych and Gov't are my electives. Ouch.  Sometimes I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. I guess that's just me.  I remember wishing CHS people would read this...and a voice not far from my forehead told me, "Be careful what you wish for..." This is a prime-time Lounge now. That is, the majority of the visitors come here for a drink at night, Eastern of course. And that's starting to make me uneasy, given the amount of lurkers...and among them, I think a listing of who's welcome and who isn't may be in order come Spring Break (which I'm not looking forward to).

       Adios,  urlLink Mac Shac , hello Super EV Nova? Time will tell.   Looks like blogshares has already indexed  urlLink EoE . And  someone  bought into it. So did I. So...if EoE ever makes it into the Hot 100 ( urlLink tFS  did, hit 21, and then sunk out, thanks to all the damned PersianBlogs mucking up the system)    urlLink DreamWorld  is a year old. It's amazing how time flies. So, at the end of one year, the standings are as follows: 1. Sathya: 30 dreams 2. TMK: 10 dreams 3. Kalin: 2 dreams 4. Andrew L.: 2 dreams, never posted 5. Madison: 1 dream 6. JC: 1 dream    I really should be working on my AP Psych stuff, but oh well.   Sent in my thing to be an intern at this law firm. Here's to hoping I'll get in. (raises mug)

      Well, so much for a win at Indy. Must be something with Gordon and starting third. He did that in 2001, blew the engine with 20 laps to go. This time it was the gearbox, but with 31 laps left.  Well, my guessing luck was good otherwise. Helio did finish second, Dixon was fourth before some freak mishap bit him under caution, Kanaan finished third, and then de Ferran won the darn thing. That's three years in a row for Penske with a win. Well, good for Gil; he's the best of the Penske drivers.   Once again, that guy who wants to give me head stopped by (Schmyler). He never gets it. Never. He reminds me of that evil voice in my head, except that voice isn't ignoring the fact that I'm skinny. He thought I was furious with JC for doing something with EoE, when I wasn't really concerned. In fact, I think I'll invite him to join us later. And who knows, maybe we'll make it four after all. He went on to claim that my multiple blogs/sites are a cry for attention, and I laughed as I read it. Attention? Sure, I have several sites, but if I was really starved for spotlight I'd diss people I don't know or try to make TMK a household name on the Net. I'm fine with 15 visitors a day. Hell, I think he's the one in need of attention. He's been creating as much havoc as he knows how with a very warped sense of pleasure and drive for attention; why else would he come back?   Anyway, the post he made has been removed. I didn't mention that I won't tolerate his presence there, no matter how right he may seem at times. There's currently three on the no-comments-allowed list. Call me a Nazi if you want, Schmyler, but you're the one stinking up this place talking about people you don't know. I feel entertained by his commenting, so I'm allowing those that are here to stay on. I don't think he's aware that he's a rabbit's step away from the zone of cyberstalking. He's guilty of pretty much everything in the book (and  everything  in mine), and I've abetted his efforts. Anyone else who wants to talk to him can. I won't, so I can at least cover my derriere. It's the Ignore Game, and TMK leads, 1-0.  TMK to Trolls (individually): I'm the Boss and you are the bitch. Clear?   Blogger isn't cooperating much right now; the archives are still showing the self-destructing lunatic lounge, the archives won't publish, and the interface is nowhere near as nice-looking as Dano. Plus, I can't post to both normal Blogger and Dano at the same time. They need to get their shiznit straight.

      Go Ducks! A 4-0 sweep would be sweet, no? (okay, so Giggy's shutout streak is over...)   urlLink    1. What drinking water do you prefer -- tap, bottle, purifier, etc.? Tap's okay, but I wouldn't get used to it. Bottle's good but not all bottled water is good. I guess I'd have to side with filtered water.  2. What are your favorite flavor of chips? Lays - Classic  3. Of all the things you can cook, what dish do you like the most? Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. Anything else is an adventure and a disaster waiting to happen.  4. How do you have your eggs? I don't. Don't remember.  5. Who was the last person who cooked you a meal? How did it turn out? Hmm. My mom. As always, good.   Today's one-time edition of Do I remember you? Shinjinee...heard she went to Germany last year on a study trip. I bet she's off performing herculean tasks somewhere... Memory: Barely. Julia....today would be her birthday, wherever the hell she is. Memory: Ended with 2002. Well...had to point those two out. Next point.   DreamWorld Crew ( Sathya and Kalin ): You wouldn't believe it...I was just perusing the DWthree(at)hotmail e-mail, sifting through the spam, and guess what I found! Personal mail!!  From a guy named Mark who came across the site...he asked me some good questions, really. I sent a response yesterday. So someone actually mailed us...w00t. I wish I'd kept reading up on dreams and sleep so I could have better answered him, but oh well. You get what you ask for from a closed site.   It would be nice to remind our trolls of cyberstalking legislation already passed and legislation in the works. Under the grounds of some of these laws, I'd have serious loot on 'em. But hey, as long as I don't get any phone calls or anything, I'd say almost no holds barred is just fine with me.   It's certainly going to be a busy weekend.     urlLink DreamWorld  Countdown , Part III:  Dream 14 (Sathya) - Submitted: July 27, 2002    BreakAway:  This was the first of the second wave of dreams and a "new order," if you will. Beginning here-ish, I requested that all dreams be submitted with title and character profiles. (Of course, for Sathya, I let that slide, since she was/is the chief contributor) It was also the start of the humorless editing thing. I started taking it seriously...I declared myself Admin (no one objected) and then moved on with Site One. Anyway...  Title:  Cake Chasing, Boat Building   Characters  (graduation years in brackets): Everyone in school (to mention a few, Lyndsay [2004], Colleen [(2004], Cody [2003], Thomas [2004], Tabby [2005], Priya [2005], Jenny [2005], Bhavika  [NYLF person]   Setting : Humungous pool, with three big boats hung across it, a club of some sort, with a dancing room (outside the dancing room was a ballroom with a lot of tables set up for a dinner).   Situation : Four other people and I have to do this project for our big group (about 25 people), which was to make a buoyant ship out of paper. And then all of the other subgroups in our big group are going to put all of the little ships together to form a bigger ship, on the far right of the pool.          Our subgroup hadn't gotten much done. It was nighttime, and I hadn't gone to the dancing room last night, and I heard it was  "rockin". I decided to go this night to check it out. As I was walking through the ballroom I see Bhavika at a table. I stroll over and ask her if she would like to join me (apparent answer: yes). So we go into the dancing room and everyone is sitting in a circle, just chillin' (so to speak).        I see Thomas and there are two empty spotso next to him. I run over and sit next to him, but suddenly there's barely enough room for me to fit, let alone Bhavika. Consequently, I felt bad because Bhavika had no place to sit. I guess I got over that, though. She went somewhere, and I stayed there with Thomas. It was pretty good that no one was dancing because this atmosphere was a lot better for me [one who can't dance at all!].        We were talking and such, then someone from my subgroup comes in and gets three of us out of there to discuss how we're going to finish the project. We get that settled and return to the dance room, but there's now a security guard saying that the boats are leaving and we can't be there. We see the first boat leaving the "port", which is filled with little kids, as was the second boat. Then we tell him that we were in the third boat (the largest of the three). The dancing room had apparently turned into the third boat, and we were all magically wearing our bathing suits.        He lets us in and I find Thomas again. Then magically we are not in the boat anymore, but in the three-foot deep shallow end of the pool, watching the three boats (stretched across the pool). This is now the competition to see whether the boats would float or not. Now they are whatever yachts are made out of and look really nice. The first two boats are hanging above the water, and ours (the one that I helped create, but not really because our group didn't finish) was in the water showing off that it could float.        The first two boats at the competition messed up because they couldn't get it (the boat) into the water nicely. Ours, however, worked pretty well, paying off in a competition win. Then someone came with a HUGE cake and took it to the far end of the pool, on top of this construction tower kind of thing and everyone took off after it. Thomas swam like a bullet, leaving me alone. Then I found Tabby. Some people were running outside of the pool and others gave up, jumped into the pool and swam to the cake. I chose to run, but Tabby deserted me and jumped into the pool as well. It's weird because it's faster to run outside of water than to swim in it.        I started to walk and I came spotted Priya and Jenny. Priya was too far up for me to try to catch her, so I kept walking. Then I saw Lyndsay and Colleen, with Lyndsay wearing bright red pants and a jean jacket. She kind of stood out, as everyone else was wearing bathing suits. But they had both just gotten out of the pool. Lyndsay was dry (don't ask me how). Anyway, they were also too far up so I didn't try to catch them.        Suddenly Lyndsay appeared beside me. She had seen me and come to talk. She said she couldn't leave Colleen for that long, and breaks off running. Then I start running after her and say that I'll hang with them (just kind of invited myself; it was better than walking alone).        When we reached Colleen, she was talking with some guy and was like "Well, I'll be in Paris for a few days and you can meet me at the Cafe D Lach (or something like that)." She sounded really posh, though, and I started making fun of her, then broke off and said something to Lyndsay about not knowing that she went to Europe.        Meanwhile, as were walking we see Cody Chaffins with a huge piece of cake. We get to the platform where the cake is supposed to be and its not crowded at all, so we wonder if there's any left. But we go up and see anyway.  ---End of dream---  Other notes: The pool, by the way, had to be like a half mile to a mile long, if it took me that long to walk/run from one end to the other end.

      Even more when I figure out the next ideas to go after.  2. Is nuclear terrorism a realistic option for terrorists?  No, but yes. Think about it. The time, money, effort, and  luck  needed for a group of insurgents to acquire the device (which would probably have to be one of the myriad many low-defense Russian plants), transport it to a secret location, assemble the device (including the nuclear materials, which aren't exactly found at Big Lots), transport it to the target, detonate it,  and  escape capture are simply enormous, bordering on impossible. (In Tom Clancy's  The Sum of All Fears , however, Ishmael Qati and his collaborators were able to do it during a Super Bowl - the way a terrorist should do it, I think.)  I think the results of detonating a nuclear device at a certain site sure grab the headlines and the Collective Fear better than oh, "another car bombing." Terrorists, I'm sure, would rather incapacitate an area the size of a city for a lengthy amount of time, rather than to do it for a couple of days. All of this means...? Terrorists would probably snatch up the shot to do a nuclear thingy if they could do it easily.    BreakAway : Does anyone remember the rumors, in the 10-11 AM hour of September 11, 2001, of a carbombing at the State Dept. building? See, it didn't make much sense and was dismissed as what it was, a rumor.  3.  urlLink Bush's nuclear arms plan / Administration wants billions to update U.S. warheads   Sounds good to me, but is it really necessary nowadays? The only country, I think, that even resembles a nuclear target is China. Even then, the PRC only has about 20 ICBMS capable of hitting CONUS so far (more are in planning to project a long-range threat). Sure, 20 is enough to lay waste to the West Coast and then some, but do we need (insert far higher number here) ICBMS, located on subs and in silos, to lay waste to China? Nope. Russia has so many of its own nuclear problems to deal with, I don't think they'll be worrying out their longtime rivals (us) anytime soon, unless the ABM system gets back in the news.  So it's an  update , not an expansion. So far.  In case you haven't read last year's Nuclear Posture Review (I'll look for a link), you should...there's a small pullquote on it's nature in the article: "The policy paper, produced by the Pentagon, said the United States should not just maintain the capability to launch large nuclear counterstrikes as a deterrent to nuclear powers, but should consider possibly striking pre-emptively at those countries developing nuclear, chemical or biological weapons."  -> I smell North Korea, if this ever comes true, but I'm stating the obvious.  Among other things, we'll (US gov't) be working on some puny-yield nukes (we're talking 5 kilotons, which is oh, anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 the yield of the only other nuclear devices used in anger) and some bunker-buster nukes (I guess these bombs will be part of the B-2 missions).    Wednesday What-ifs  (link later)  1. What if you could choose to be the ruler of one country on Earth? Hmm...probably the good ole' USA. China would be a close second. I'd like to see who the second superpower will be in a decade, probably the PRC.  2. What if you could be one politically influential person who is alive today (like President Bush or even Oprah)?  Not  Tony Blair.  3. What if you could finalize one cause (such as end world hunger or stop animal cruelty)? I would end unrestricted rainforest destruction, and then probably force the US into the Kyoto deals.  4. What if you could entirely make-over your own country -- what would it be like? We'd be a country of democratic socialists...or a police state. Probably somewhere in between. I'd have my own Committee for State Security (aka KGB) and personal Republican Guard. Otherwise, the country remains as it is now.  5. What if you could start a new planet -- what it would be like?  It would be hot, 24x7x365 (meaning that it should be roughly the same distance from its sun as Earth). Hot breezies, free-flowing oceans, a lost continent with tyrannosaurs...and genetically enhanced monkeys.     -> Just downloaded Amphetadesk. It's good, and it's for the PC, unlike NetNewsWire.  -> Poor Aileen...looks like she'll be hobbling around for a long time. I almost feel her pain. Almost.  -> DreamWorld Recap will be back soon.  -> I'm replacing TMK One with...you could have guessed it. Another blog. Actually, I won't use it as a blog, but as an update posting deal. Everything else will be as it was, template mods aside. It has a title, but right now I won't bother linking to it...I guess I'm calling it "31 Ounces of Uzo"  (although the actual drink is called " urlLink Ouzo ", which I've quietly ignored).

      I guess I'll open the fallout shelter's nuclear discussion...it's kind of amusing, that when someone asks about nukes (warheads) or missiles, I almost always wind up being the person referred to for an answer. I guess its uncomfortable, but I enjoy it nevertheless.  1. Is nuclear war winnable? No. Military strategists will and have contended that it is, but in the sense of preserving a reasonable civilian population size, it really isn't. Military strategists are forced to employ a strategy of what I call "Strategic Genocide," the systematic elimination of civilian and military targets, in order to fulfill something like that. Millions would die in their theory that "if we get more of our nukes through then they do to us, we'll stop 'em cold before they can hit us again."  In a morbid sense, nuclear war is winnable, but at the cost of most of the populations of  both  nations (or more, even)? So, no. I don't think nuclear war is winnable. Besides, who would you celebrate with?  More later, when I figure out the next question to answer.    Someone  who reads this gave Priya the nice little idea that I said she was a bitch in yesterday's entry. Fortunately, the writing speaks for itself, and hopefully I was vindicated. Imagine  this  for an opener on your Trillian IM window: Session Start (AIM - champcarfan2931:Priya) Priya: hey, i am not a bitch! *** Auto-response sent to Priya: I was here... ChampCarFan2931: I didn't call you a bitch, Priya. What are you talking about?  You know, one of the things I never expected to see in this blog was the potential for things to be misread, or in this guy's particular case,  outright manipulated . I'm a straight-up writer, just with an unassuming twist. That's all I try to be. But nooo....here I go again, complaining about what people say about this blog. Sooner or later, I'm simply going to appoint Kalin the admin and leave this place for the Interstate.   I never did mention the Alias finale, did I? Well, it was...bizarre. The second season of the spy thriller ends two years in the future, a future in which a formerly lovestruck (with Syd) Vaughn is married. Sydney was feared dead. Other than that, we'll have to wait until September-ish 2003.  All this season finale talk reminds me of Smallville...for a while I stopped watching, only to realize the only things I'd been missing were the reruns. Tonight's finale (part one, anyway), was full of those "iced out" moments. I guess the sharpest one was a minute from the end, when Chloe caught Clark making out hard with Lana (she stalked off, tears flowing down her cheeks), but hey, Helen's dismissal of Lex was sharp, too. Next week, the red Kryptonite returns, and Clark will be set to ice everyone, including his own "family." I'm looking forward to it.    urlLink    1. Packrat or minimalist? Packrat 2. Computer: desktop or laptop? Laptops preferred cold, not shaken or stirred 3. Seashore or mountains? Mountains 4. Carpeting or bare floors? carpeting 5. Drinking water: bottled or tap? Bottled 6. Shopping websites: eBay or Amazon? Please. 7. Cute little kitties or big scary tigers? Kittens. 8. Front door or back door? Whichever one that gets me less attention 9. Lots of jewelry, or little/none? Ice, ice, and more ice. Power to those that have it. 10. Thought-provoking question of the week: At the last minute, you obtain tickets to an event you're dying to attend. However, you have to work that day! Do you ask the boss for the time off, or just call in sick? Call in sick and pray to high heavens that the boss won't be there/is a fan.

      I don't really have much to talk about today, so I'll KIS(S) for now.  The worst thing about today was the bus...the polarizing discussion over Fight Club between Ben and Priya/Jenny. Never have I heard such a ruthlessly pointless argument. Ben had said something about the author of FC not intending the book for little teen breezies, instead for fair-to-middlin' white guys with no purpose in life. PK and Jenny seemed to go off on this one, and it was on. IT could have ended five minutes before it did if the girls  heard  listened to what Ben said, but hey, they wanna be fans, lettem' be fans. At least they don't go stepping on my Champ Cars in my sight.  I'd never read Fight Club or given it the time of day before this argument (of which I found solace in taking potshots at the breezies), and now I  especially  don't plan to. That's another polarizing deal I'd rather avoid (not to mention the fact that I'm being blamed for everything negative said about Priya - on the flip side, some of it  is  true...).  This thing is the fallout shelter, isn't it? Well, in time, I'll be adding some 2000s nuclear war info so we can all be reminded that nuclear war is still a possibility these days. Hell, I'll start tomorrow.   And about that new blog...Joe, I'm considering your request. You'll find out sooner or later. I have two people to invite right away, but the thing that troubles me (sike, no it doesn't - it just got my attention) is that there's no breezies here. The last breezy that posted wanted to know about my old template, and before that we have to rewind back to the start of November 2002, to find Kim. That leaves plenty of room for a breezy to post around here...but no, looks like our breezies are  spineless whores * or something...come on. This place is finally getting the comments, but they're basically all from one gender.  I'm so mad at myself for BlogShares (the button on the left). the BlogShares stock I owned, all 50 of them, suddenly jumped from $.45 to $674 in fifteen hours yesterday. My personal value jumped from $1300-ish to $35,000-ish. What happened? My greedy ass waited too long, and the BS price plummeted to $.03 once some idiot bought all the shares. So I could have been rich, but now I'm no better off. Bitches...  Speaking of bitches...I did a recount and I think I'm missing one or two.    Day two of the  urlLink DreamWorld  countdown...this one was the second dream that launched DreamWorld (or at least forced my hand in starting the site)...one of my favorites.  June 3, 2002   Dream 2 (TMK)  General Notes: This is really simple, as the entire set is about five miles high and twenty feet across. Also, I might wind up fudging a couple of facts, but I doubt those will be important.   Characters  Me (TMK, several years older) Barney           Sathya Kalin People on the other side of the phone           Tour guide   Setting : severely distorted Grand Canyon&#8230;no water at the bottom, much taller (several miles so)&#8230;mid-afternoon, mid-90s (but when you're falling, things must be a tad bit cooler, I think.)   Here goes&#8230;the three of us (the DW Crew) , led by a tour guide, are hiking through a trail in the Grand [Supermodified] Canyon during the summer&#8230;Judging by my looks, this looks like three years in the future. The tour guide struggles to keep up, so we're almost always lost&#8230;I'm out there cracking jokes like an idiot and nearly slip off a path.   Personal commenting : The past snippet sounds believable, but the next doesn't&#8230;  So, all of a sudden, the ground starts to shake. An earthquake is in progress. The tour guide falls over like a balloon, and rolls away into oblivion. (Gray matter here, not completely sure of following statement) Somehow, the intentions of my friends change, and the next moment I find myself sliding down a slope, which unfortunately leads to&#8230;nothing&#8230;but seven miles of air. I'm gripping a little thing sticking out from the ground, hanging for dream life, like in a movie. Kalin scrambles over, ostensibly to grab my right hand. Instead, he steps on it, nearly breaking it&#8230;I yelp in pain and switch hands. He kicks my left hand away, and I fall.  So I'm seven miles up, falling rapidly. I hear the cackling laughter from above, and I instinctively grab my cell phone. I rip it out and dial my house (no idea why). Of course, no one's home. I change numbers and dial the phone booth closest to the trail we were walking on. Someone picks up, but can't hear me. And then I do the most unbelievable thing&#8230;I dial Barney's number.       Barney: &#8220;Hello, little boy, what can I do for you?&#8221;      Me: &#8220;#%##, Barney, I'm falling five miles to my death! Help!&#8221;      Barney: &#8220;Do you need a hug?&#8221;      Me: &#8220;#%#$###@1! Barney!&#8221;      Barney: &#8220;I love you, you love me&#8230;&#8221;      Me: &#8220;What the&#8230;(loud scream)&#8221;      Barney: &#8220;And a kiss from me to you&#8230;&#8221;      Me (fighting to regain calm): &#8220;Barney, listen. Get Baby Bop or whatever the hell her name is, or somebody, and have her bring me a big trampoline, on the double, dammit!&#8221;      Barney: &#8220;Yes, sir. You sound like you need a hug!&#8221;       Okay, so it may not have gone all like that, but it was close. So, as I reset here for the readers, I'm still falling, now 4 miles above the ground. Sathya and Kalin are on their way out and home, and Barney's &#8220;fleet&#8221; is on its way to rescue me.  It's just another calm moment for me as I fall; I'm combing my hair and fumbling for my water bottle. In the process I lose my cell phone. And out of nowhere comes this giant mass of purple to save me. It's Barney. So now I'm about ten seconds from hitting the ground&#8230;and then&#8230;nothing.

      Word on the street is that Google is about to remove blogs from its search engine. And with that, I bid adieu to half of my traffic, which usually means the star of Mr. Personality or the late-night anchor on Headline News, both of whom I've mentioned a whopping  one  time (and wound up with well over fifty hits between them to this mess).  Mad props to Robby and the AGR crew. Robby held the provisional pole for most of today (Pole Day was rained out yesterday), only to see Kanaan bump him to 2nd and then Castroneves, a Penske guy, who would get the  urlLink pole  at a 231.7 mph 4-lap average.   It's been almost a year since the beginning of the  urlLink DreamWorld  project.  Sathya, Kalin!  A year ago! Has it been that long? Apparently. I shuttered the project in March, after moving it to a new  urlLink site . You know what the worst thing about DW is? The  worst  thing?   The fact that DW was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. One summer, one summer only. This summer I have not one, but two jobs lined up, not to mention endless cross country practice, a trip to Seattle, and anything else I have up my mom's sleeve. Sathya's got GHP, and Kalin...well...he'll be busy, I suppose.  DreamWorld failed once school started. And then it was reborn briefly in November, only to completely collapse again in mid-month for [almost] obvious reasons. I should have seen it coming. Sathya was my  only  chief contributor and collaborator. When she stopped and turned, the entire project collapsed. I wasn't dreaming, Kalin wasn't from the get-go. Others, like JC and Phillip...I don't know...had some interesting criticisms of our dreams, and I wasn't pleased at all with that, which prevented me from trying to recruit them. Three members wasn't enough. Extensive advertising efforts failed. Miserably. After all that I went through, all I have to show for it is ONE guestbook signee. (Well, there's Alice, but she only e-mailed once. Sathya, remember her?)  DW, I bet, would have survived if it was a Blogger-powered site. You see, rather than piece together dreams from Sathya and Kalin into something coherent enough for the rest of the internet, I could have had them create Blogger IDs and let them post to a blog manually. We would have been a group blog, and people love group blogs. Instant commenting. But NO!! I was critical of blogs. I thought they weren't "true" websites. And they  still  aren't, but that's another story for another day. (But hey, if Blogger-powered blogs aren't really real, then what are Xanga sites? Those things are for babies who are either too lazy for HTML or for those who are afraid to be tossed off the community-driven, spoon-fed interface. Funny how I didn't mention Movable Type or Greymatter in this sentence.) DW would have survived if it was a CMS (content management system).   DW is over. Can't string together enough cooperation either of my collaborators to start something up again, not that I blame them.    In the meantime, I'll simply repost one of the first dreams from DW. And, since TMK is in the mood for nostalgia, I'll be doing this up to the 1-year anniversary of the start of DreamWorld. Dream 7  (Sathya)   From:  June 20, 2002   Setting: Varies (Including but not limited to CCHS facility, Priya's house)   Main Characters:      Sathya                                  Thomas                                       A doctor                                  Dr. Hunt    Editor's Note: Occasionally I'll drop in a few comments or clarifications, and most will be noted with parentheses.  It was during school, and my back started to hurt, as though I slept on it wrong or something. The pain was just to the left of my right shoulder blade. I was sent to this doctor who just happened to be at the school at the time, and I was diagnosed as having "screwed-up-bones" (Not sure if that's an ailment anybody's ever heard of).  The treatment was that they would have to cut open my back & rearrange the bones. Also, one of the bones was one in my spinal cord (Ouch, that's got to hurt). Anyway, now I had to go home and then call the doctor, and then everyone had to go to Priya's house (she's a neighbor), and the doctor had to perform the operation on Priya's coffee table.       That was what I was supposed to do, head over to Priya's house, but when we actually walked to her house "in reality", she was having company, so the operation couldn't be done there. Despite that, my dad was going to ask her mom (for permission) anyway! Imagine being asked if someone could perform an operation on your coffee table! Consequently, I never got the operation. However, on Monday (at school), my back still hurt, and Thomas offered to give me one of his famous back rubs (Readers, you're not alone&#8230;I've never heard about those either&#8230;)!       But we were in math, with Dr. Hunt, but class was taking place in Mrs. Smith-Hunt (eighth-grade math teacher, not well liked by many)'s room...Nonetheless, I eagerly accepted the offer, but I was set on taking the rub like a real massage and I wanted to get on the table (don't tell her that sounds perverted, she knows).  Just as I was about to hop on, Dr. Hunt wanted everyone to sit down (ostensibly for class) and I was like "NOOOO!" Then she handed out Backstreet Boys pictures & lyrics (There goes the logic)! I was complaining about not getting lyrics.    Post-Dream Quotes: "I have NO idea why I dreamed of back problems!"

       urlLink Wired News: Blogger: Catch Me If You Can  This is a pretty neat story.  I mean, look at the opening of the  urlLink blog : "On March 2, 2003 at 4:12 pm, I disappeared. My name is isabella v., but it's not. I'm twentysomething and I am an international fugitive."  Its a lengthy read, so I'm not going to say it's any good or not just yet.  I have to raise this question, though: If you were an "international fugitive," how did you find the time to craft such an elegant template (although at the heart of it all it looks like an original Eliza Wee template), complete with commenting, java scripts, and a hit counter?   I bet it's a hoax. A good one, but maybe all the right details aren't falling into place.

       urlLink That's Racin' | 05/09/2003 | Governor unhurt after wrecking race car at Charlotte track  Southern accent time. North Carolinah. Judgin by the crumpled front fender, the Gov'nor done got loose up off'a turn two and looped it around goin' down th'a backstretch at oh, 160 mph.   This is my kind of governor. You will  never  see Sonny Perdue trying to hotlap it around AMS (Atlanta Motor Speedway), and if he does, then cows can fly. edit: 20 feet wide...not long. You'll see, further down.    urlLink    Didn't like today's edition, so...March 1, 2002...  1. What's your favorite vacation spot? London. If the American standard of living wasn't as good as it is, I'd be begging to live over there once I get out of my house.  2. Where do you consider to be the biggest hell-hole on earth? Veteran's Stadium, in Philadelphia. I've never been there, but I sure don't like the Philly fans that frequent the place. Thank goodness it's going to be destroy-...wait. That won't get rid of the fans, though...bummer.  3. What would be your dream vacation? A trip around the world in 80 days, with an unlimited (or at least one with a very high ceiling) budget. I'd probably drag two of my best friends off with me...  4. If you could go on a road-trip with anyone, who would it be and why?  Road trip? (Perverted thought #1: Britney Spears. She could hang out the side and flash people, who in turn would give her money. She would then give  me  the money...)  Chris Rock; he's the funniest guy on the face of the earth. Or maybe some chick from CHS...  5. What are your plans for this weekend? To work on hw, do the math project (yes, a project in math?!), and try to get healthy again.   Yeah, looks like our trolls finally gave up. Set up the board next to the comments as a detour..we'll see if they're as lazy as I thought.  My front yard has a sinkhole, thanks partly to the storms of early this week. The main part of it is about 6x5 feet and about 5 feet deep. No, it gets worse. Not only is it in the front yard, it runs beneath the entire driveway, which is oh, 20 or so feet wide.  Principal blame can be placed on the constructors, and that was in 1998. (Yeah, a 5-year old house with a burgeoning sinkhole.)  GO DUCKS!!! - I'm so happy for the Mighty Ducks...I don't wanna outline a history of the team named after the Disney movies, but the bottom line is...they went for it (the postseason) with key offseason acquisitions, became the most improved team in the NHL this season, and now are FOUR wins away from the Stanley Cup finals...  And Robby's currently the fastest in pre-Indy practice. I think he, his Andretti-Green teammates Kanaan, Andretti, and Wheldon, in addition to the Penske guys, the Ganassi boys, and maybe Scott Sharp, will be the guys to watch for Pole Day.   Hey girls! Are you part of the IBTC? Hehe. No, don't let  me  judge that...    Andrew was on IM talking about how this blog isn't interesting enough.  Surprise response: I agree with him 300%. Anyone have any insights on how to make this place better, aside from shuttering it (which is an option)? Leave a message.

      Nice one. If it was to draw me out of hiding, it worked.   And for those of you declaring this thing as out of commission, check the dates on this weblog. My last entry was only  four  days ago! If you're (a collective "you") going to moan, groan, and mock about this thing, please, be my guest and stop reading. No, really. The fewer of you readers at CHS, the better. I don't "owe" anyone an entry, and something like the preceding comment will only serve to infuriate me. (Nothing personal, Kalin. Just watch the dates between posts next time.)  I'm really tired and I'm now getting very, very annoyed with people who keep referring to this thing outside of (or in, for that matter) my presence. I think it hit a boiling point yesterday with Priya (whom I cannot understand at all anymore, and certainly knows how to push the wrong buttons in my mind), and so I'm starting to draw some basic codes of conduct for the shelter. I'll continue to tolerate this (the "roundy-round don't tell me" idea), but there's a three-strike warning. Three more outside references at CHS and this place goes. The new blog would hopefully be ready by then. That means you,  couple  (they should know who they are). Watch it.  Also, I've said it in nearly every entry I've made, but apparently people aren't listening. There is another blog. I've been working on it and not this decrepit, memory-poisoning place for the last week. I've been copying entries to this place in some cases.   The new site policy  1. I guess I'll be offering new e-mail addresses at the new site. 2. For commenting, it's going to be my way or the highway. I don't like what's being said, I'll click the delete button at will. 3. 31-60-9 Blogging. Meaning? 31% of my entries will go here (okay, so that won't work- but at least I got the 31 in there)...60% of my entries will be at the new site...and 9% will be at TMKvstheWorld or an unknown contender to be named later. 4. Don't expect daily entries. I entertained you people on that here for a while, and once I stopped you all thought it was all over.  And I'm working on an interview, which I think will answer all of my doubts and maybe put me a little more at peace.

      Morning edit: Robby wound up 4th, after a rain delay called the race on lap 393. Great job.  And I guess I'm should note that today (or tomorrow, I'm not sure anymore) is Abeeda's birthday. It's a long story, going all the way back to last September. Auf Wiedersehen.    urlLink MTV.com - News -'Bling Bling' Added To Oxford English Dictionary   Oh, and Robby. This guy had a flat tire on lap 3 of 400, went three full laps (tail end of 4 laps) down, dropped all the way to last place. Robby kept digging the rest of the way, and presto, by lap 340, he'd made up all of the laps and...Took the Lead. I'm writing at 19 to go, and Rubs sits in 4th. His car doesn't seem as good as it was about 100 laps ago, but a top 5 considering what he's gone through tonight will be a great performance. More later.    Anyway, a bunch of guys in third period physics (and later, me) decided to have a draft. We're ranking the females in the school ala the NFL, so there's going to be first round picks, second round, undrafted free agents, and so on.  Ryan and I discussed the one who would have been my top pick (no, I haven't mentioned her at all on this blog, so don't go snooping).  saxguy917: CMON MAN!! ChampCarFan2931: hey, she's not that bad...she has a nice...lower package... ChampCarFan2931: umm. saxguy917: WAHT!!?! saxguy917: WHAT LOWER PACKAGE?!!

      Oh, we Americans and our luxuries. One power outage and we all start crawling up the walls. Or at least I did- (riminy, I couldn't even get "good" water, since it was the refrigerator that was KO'd. But hey, at least we're in America, where the power is almost certainly going to come back, as opposed to say...North Korea. Using the satellite thing I linked to earlier, it is obvious that the "Democratic" People's Republic of Korea is having serious energy woes at night. South Korea may be properly lit at night, but the DPRK looks like a conventional blast zone.  I took the SAT this morning.Chad and Matt were in my room. I found it surprisingly...deceptive. It could have been very easy, and I might have done well. On the flip side, it might have been pretty hard and I shortcircuited myself by not sleeping until 0045 hours this morning. We'll see.  For once, Schmyler raises a good point in his latest troll session/commentary, a couple of posts down. It is kind of sad to blog about blogging. So, I'll actually credit him with something good, but my response wasn't up to where it could be.  My  urlLink archives  are dying. Dano had better get here soon for this blog. Yeah, what?  In the meantime, I think I'll do some more news snaps and a Friday Five, Saturday edition.  urlLink    Again. Comp crashed during the first. 1. Name one song you hate to admit you like. If You're Not the One - Daniel Bedingfield Honorable mention: Desert Rose - Sting 2. Name two songs that always make you cry. As I Lay Me Down - Sophie Hawkins I Shall Believe - Sheryl Crow Honorable mention : Fields of Gold - Sting 3. Name three songs that turn you on. An Ode to Maybe - Third Eye Blind Short Skirt/Long Jacket - Cake Androgyny - Garbage Honorable mention : Losing a Whole Year - 3EB 4. Name four songs that always make you feel good. Wanksta - 50 Cent Machine Says Yes - FC Kahuna On the Grind - Nelly Steve McQueen - Sheryl Crow Honorable mention: Work it - Nelly feat. Justin Timberlake 5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without. Crush - Jennifer Paige Lifehouse - Quasimodo American Bad Ass - Kid Rock EI - Nelly Maybe That's Something - Sheryl Crow Honorable mention: Big Pimpin - Jay-Z

      Opera 7.1 = Nice. Blogging in Opera = Nightmarish The lifespan of this blog = Shortening My concern about what is thought of that = minimal My response to getting the 3000th visitor = Nothing but a small acknowledgement.  I was asked today, "How many blogs do you have?" Good one. Let's see. There's TMK vs the World, which I haven't posted to in a month. There's my Xanga, which I neither link to or post to, which means it doesn't really exist anymore to me. There's this blog, which I think I'll give up by Indy Pole Day. And then...there's the new one. Dano-powered, I might add. I can say this much: significantly fewer gimmicks (ie. no lounge or anything), just a TMK-esque title. The scheme is done, just awaiting a spike in traffic that this one got in October when I blogged about Johnny Brown and then the threats Iraq and North Korea are not...and then..presto. Almost-pop blog.   Where I was going with that one is...the new one needs members. New members would be cool, although fair play doesn't exist in my judgement calls. So...three spots open, Kalin will occupy one of them. I wonder who the other takers on the road to the new site will be...   Hey, satellite  urlLink views  of the Earth.    urlLink  Yahoo! News - Georgians Plan Whites-Only Prom Party    Hey, people, we're not there yet. Sure, this is GA, but that's down in "I've never heard of that county before unless it's about a prom"-ville. I remember hearing about this last year when it was integrated. I remarked, "Wow, how backwards. It's about damned time."  Wow, how backwards.

      Sweet. Everything's been moved over to Dano. Now I can actually post stuff without comparing it to the  urlLink EoE  interface now. I can finally republish my archives, though I haven't tried to yet.  I figured I owed this blog an entry or ten, so here goes:  1. Why is it that 7th-graders constantly use the  almost -word "noe" in place of "know" on AIM? It's only one letter short of the full thing....  2. My internship deal has become a job. It suddenly isn't fun anymore, but jobs aren't supposed to be, are they?  3. You mean it's been twelve days since the last entry here? Wow.  4. Blogshares: So far, up to about 6.1 million in worth and growing daily. I'm now a tester for the new features in the game, and I'm very impressed by what I see.  5. I've come up with a replacement to the audioblogger thing I had a couple of months ago, this time powered by Voicemonkey...maybe I'll make it into a show or something.  6. EoE's trolls aren't gone, either, but they've made it to my new forum.  7. ESPN's doing a profile on a 5-year old kid people think is really good at basketball. Hype for a kindergartner? When will it end? I guess the next thing we know unborn babies of famous baller wives will be scanned for Potential.  8. I'm getting bored. I'm moving on over to EoE to finish up today's entry.  Salut !

      Another day, another template. It's an end to the madness, I hope. It's been in the woodshed of teemmmkay one for a while, and I figured SI might do well with a better primary.  I have a job now. Sort of. I'll be an intern at a law firm, beginning Monday at 8AM. It means I'll have to go shopping for new slacks and dress stuff, since I'm going to be a Corporate Suit-in-training for the next month.  Glad I had nothing to do but watch Speed Channel today, or else I would have missed the Jeff Gordon / Juan Montoya special, where Gordo test-drives Montoya's F-1 car and JM tests Gordo's Winston Cup car at the Indy Road Course...awesome stuff.  So...having accidentally PO'd one member of the opposite sex based on the last F5, I'll shut up for now. Misogynist I am  not .  Ever seen the Eastwood Insurance commercial? Where the cowboy rescues the damsel in distress from outrageous insurance rates? Did you see the text in it? It says, "Open Weekends and Saturdays." Uh, oops?   And finally my e-mail inbox is beginning to feel loved. Okay, kind of...but at least it's a start.  Looking at repositioning the layouts again (this one may go to  urlLink EoE , the other may come here), but that may be later in the week or next week when I'm off work (ehm...I'll have to get used to saying that now.).

      I've taken up Microsoft's new  Freelancer  game. It's nothing like Ambrosia's Escape Velocity (EV Nova is the flagbearer) series. The game is played in 3D, unlike EV's overhead, boxcar-like interface. Going into a planetary bar is suddenly more than a detached mouseclick. Videos play interesting vignettes every time one talks to someone, and better yet, every time you talk to someone (like the bartender on Planet Pittsburgh), he/she remembers the last conversation. A smart game, but it should be expected to be when it takes up 1.3 gigs in hard drive space.  Speaking of hard drives, the problem with my computer was with the 80-gig thing. Turns out that the problem was physical, with a jumper cable  inside  the system, and not with software corruption. So I get to keep my 4 gigs of music and 3 gigs of illegal games for now. Did I mention the system got a new CD burner?   All's nice, but it throws a knuckleball into my quest for a new system or laptop since the system's healthy again.    You know what? Unless I'm proven wrong, I may well have one of the last non-Xanga/LiveJournal blogs at CHS now that the seniors (Shalin, Maya, Jin Hee, etc.) are gone...I feel isolated. A CHS blogring would be cool, but no one would be in it other than the many underclassmen Xangans and your deceased LiveJournals. And me.  Then again, I guarantee that there are about a dozen or two Bulldog blogs I don't know about, and with good reason. Privacy. Diaryland has a way of password-protecting diaries, as do uJournal, LiveJournal, and DeadJournal (all have the same source code). Good for them. Heaven knows I would have found that useful for Blogger.  A cursory look at my site logs can tell me that those wacky AOL users (or user?) manage to hit up EoE at one in the morning. Or two in the morning. Kind of hard to understand, but then again, I don't visit blogs when I could be sleeping soundly.

        urlLink  Friday Five , a day late   1. How many times have you truly been in love? The last  real  case must have been a bit over three years ago - damn, has it been that long? There are the close calls and the works-in-progress...the close friendships (the ones where the guy is stuck in platonica and the girl can say that he's the spare dick in a glass case - in case of emergency, break open! - without his realizing it ; sorry, me? no, not that extreme a case)...the meet-you-halfway without the girl meeting halfway...or the "oops, how did this happen?" crush syndrome...go on? No.  2. What was/is so great about the person you love(d) the most? It's a 50-50 deal, equal love from both sides. Even when she was obviously having a bad day, she always finds time to listen to my rants (since I don't do much of that with her)...and vice versa...We usually wave to each other or exchange arched eyebrows (like an unspoken "Hi, how are you?") every time we make eye contact. It helps to be told that you're a great listener, as I've been told I am - I supposedly have this calm demeanor that makes it easy for people to tell me things that trouble them.  3. What qualities should a significant other have? She should probably have my ballpark-area interests, and if she doesn't she shouldn't try to ignore mine.   I guess she should be pretty, not always "hot" and on the road to Siliconia, nor should she have to put on a pound of makeup in the morning to look good. She shouldn't have boobs the size of basketballs or golfballs. She shouldn't have Wolverine-like fingernails. Painted toenails and multicolored/mismatching socks are a minus. She should be in shape. Most importantly, her personality should be  bubbly , the kind of personality that can take the most mundane of conversations or conversation topics and make them into watercooler discussions.  Oh, and if she's got a problem with something I do or did, she should say something (be forthright) about it rather than try to hide it and give me the chance to discover it on my own. A clue, please? That's one of my chief pet peeves about women. They (most of them) try to be nice, you know, trying to avoid a direct conflict, and wind up only making things worse.   Summary:  Good looks Stunning personality Adequate upstairs where the hair is Forthrightness when it counts  4. Have you ever broken someone's heart? Me? No, but I'd like to.  5. If there was one thing you could teach people about love, what would it be? - Be vigilant! Be vigilant! Be vigilant! (to the tune of Nathaniel Hawthorne)  Honorable mentions: - Never confuse love with lust. (ie. don't get butterflies in your groin when you mean them for your stomach) - You'll know when falling in love happens. And you'll know when falling out of love happens. If the latter happens, think of the former for consolation. (That can backfire, so make sure you've got a  quality backup plan in place)  Wow. Looks like my 2003 MSN horoscope has proven itself right, with the exception of the "someone will express an eternal lust for you in the Spring" part.

      Moving. Please redirect links to  urlLink this  location. For more, continue.  Arrgh. The silence in here is deafening, really. I'm tired of checking the logs and finding odd stuff and visitors probably wondering where in the world Carmen Sandiego...err. I... went.  Well, here's the short end of the story. The archives are long since damaged, so of course they read with a template I used in April and haven't been able to vanquish. Err. Right. Anyway, I placed all hope of the archives being fixed on Dano aka Blogger New, and even that wouldn't work. So...that basically means the end of this blog. For now. I mean, it still has five members and all, one accidentally being deleted in the transition, but of the five only one posts here on a normal basis. And, when this entry posts, that number dwindles to zero unless someone proves me wrong.  I'm not out of blogging altogether, but I'm not posting as much as I used to. Where am I posting?  urlLink Here . What's different? Well, aliases, for one, although not applied to everyone. More memes. More racing analysis. No trolls anymore. More blogshares talk. Audio. Dream log.  Apologies, I'm not very gifted at promotion. In any case, that's where I've fled to.  Until the next time I get the urge to post here... -TMK.

      This thing still works?  Yes, the first post in months. This isn't a start of a trend; I'm don't plan on writing here again unless it's a powerful urge. I've spent the time since the last entry getting on with what I do in life and improving my writing style.  From April through mid-November, I blogged for the End of Euphoria. After that, I moved to WordPress from Blogger and set up my own site the way I wanted it. That site, which is known as either the End of Euphoria or tmk.blog, is  urlLink here .  It's numbing in a way. I've been at weblogging for a year and change now, bordering on two years. I've made a lot of mistakes. I've made a couple of enemies (stalkers, even - see late December entries of tmk.blog) and a few friends along the way. Knowing what I know now, I would have done a lot of things differently.  Well, that's all fine and well. If you're going to form an impression of me, the person, don't read this old thing. Read the new one. It's better. Less entertaining at times, maybe, but better overall.   Salut .

We aren't here to fight the Chinese or the Russians anymore. If we're going after smaller groups, smaller nukes will do. (Then again, maybe high-powered explosives would, too...)  Disturbing, though, is the report on what is to be deactivated from the arsenal...or where is it?

      I also found it interesting to note that Iran, over the past week, has backed off its hard-line stance on its nuclear program and will submit to IAEA inspections soon. I think Iran may be hiding something, but only the clerics know. More information needs to be released first.  A link is here: urlLink Yahoo!

(washingtonpost.com)     "If there are weapons, we would like to find [them]; if there are no weapons, we would like to conclude the issue," Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview. "They owe us the classified version."   ElBaradei said the United States, like all U.N. member states, is obliged under the terms of Security Council resolutions to provide his agency with information that advances its knowledge of Iraq's past nuclear ambitions. But he said the United States has yet to respond to a request he made last month for a copy of the classified version of a report by David Kay, the head of the Iraq Survey Group, that indicated there was no new evidence Iraq had reconstituted its nuclear weapons program before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.

The treaty, which came into force in 1970, has been overtaken by a world in which developing nuclear arms has become attractive not only to many countries, but also to "terrorist groups," ElBaradei told Friday's issue of Le Monde.  The number of countries believed to be able to create such weapons "is estimated at 35 or 40," he said.

       urlLink Pentagon seeks new nuclear weapons - www.smh.com.au   Rumors from the DOD have it that maybe nuclear weapons won't be the last resort anymore, but perhaps open the door to low-level nuclear attacks.  In the future we may see neutron bombs (nukes that minimize destruction but maximize killing) and low-yield warheads (maybe 1 to 10 kilotons) in the battlefield, in addition to the nuclear bunker-busters (which do as they say for hardened military and civilian targets) which have long been in development.  Basically, this isn't what it seems. The nuclear arsenal is  modernizing  to deal with current and future threats. Russia isn't one of them, and it would be a while before (or if) China reaches the same level as the US. More weapons doesn't mean more powerful, just more efficient. We'll have to see how this goes in next month's report.

Looks like one of these wait-and-see situations. It doesn't look to be a surprise or anything, which is a positive.

       urlLink via Indy Star     Today, the old missile bunker is empty, as are similar sites near Grafton and Marine in Illinois and Pacific in Missouri. At Hecker, the soldiers and the Hercules missiles have been gone since summer 1968.  To Birkner, who helps maintain the site, the old missile bunker is a piece of Cold War history. In the '50s and '60s, most major U.S. cities were guarded by Nike bases. Kansas City had five such sites, Chicago 11.  That history, though, is rapidly disappearing. A few years ago, the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior conducted a survey of Nike missile sites in Illinois and concluded that the Hecker site and a second in Deer Park, outside Chicago, were the two best-preserved sites in the state. The Deer Park site since has been sold, and a shopping mall is now located there.  The Grafton site has largely disappeared, and the old missile bunkers have been filled in. At the site near Marine, the missile bunkers are filled with water. The Pacific site is in better shape. The old barracks serve as a warehouse and maintenance facility for a nearby school district. A school, Nike Elementary, sits next to the old barracks. The missile bunker itself, located nearby on another school-owned site, is closed but in good condition.

       urlLink MSNBC - â€˜A Race Against Time'   Linked is an interview with Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency, courtesy of  Newsweek . I'd say it's pretty informative.     Are you concerned that we might see an arms race in that region of the world if Iran goes nuclear?  It is not just a question of Iran. There is a good deal of frustration in this area. There is a good deal of a sense of impotence, imbalance and frustration because of the fact that Israel continues to be outside the regime. I have said that this is not sustainable and again it comes back to a question of security. The Middle East is the most prone for proliferation because of this sense of a security imbalance. You need to work on a security structure in the Middle East as you work on a peace process. Unfortunately this has not happened, the focus has always been on land for peace or what have you. But this is not really a serious discussion of security requirements that should undergird the peace process. I do not see any peace in the Middle East in the long term without having the region free of all chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.

       urlLink Israel stockpiling nuclear weapons     Israel's nuclear weapons have gone unpublicized because the country serves as the custodian of US interests in the Middle East. The increasing polarization within Israeli society brings to the fore environmental questions concerning the treatment of nuclear waste, reactor safety and the accountability.    I don't disagree with this assertion. Israel, for years, has been the surrogate US of the Middle East where nuclear policy stands. It's like a wink, wink situation, a lethal inside joke if you will.  This is a good profile on Israel if you're not familiar with their "secret" program.

Anything could happen," he told Reuters in Berlin, where he attended a 14-nation meeting on the issue last week.    The submarines are decommissioned vessels of the former Soviet fleet, some of which "have been rotting at their piers for several decades," Antipov told parliament last November.    Dismantling them involves removing the highly radioactive reactor compartment, hermetically sealing it to prevent leakage, and eventually transferring it to be stored for decades at a special site which Russia is building, with German help, in the northern region of Murmansk.

The resolution, which is to be ratified by the board on Friday, deplored Iran for obstructing the agency's efforts to inspect advanced centrifuge facilities, where Iran could produce weapons-grade uranium.  "Iran's cooperation has not been as full, timely, and proactive as it should have been," a final draft of the resolution said.
