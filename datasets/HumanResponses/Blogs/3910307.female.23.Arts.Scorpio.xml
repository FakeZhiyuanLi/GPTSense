       Ever have one of those days were you just wanna quit your job and move to Shrilanka? Well, for me, that day has extended for about 2 weeks now. Work stresses me out so much that I have developed an eye twitch. That's not a joke I literally have a twitch! That can't be a good sign. An average work day consists of me calling people to let them know that they can't park when they come to see the shows at the Theatre. These calls on average last about 20 mins and usually involves someone being really pissed at me. I can't blame them, I would be a little annoyed too if someone called and told me that. On the other hand some people take it a little to the extreme. The world is not going to end if you have to walk a block to get to the theater. Walking is good for you. Maybe we should just get a fleet of those little scooter things that old people use, and just have them waiting across the street for those people that forgot they have legs. People just make a big deal over stupid stuff. 50 years from now you aren't gonna care if you had to walk a block or 2 to get to your destination. God forbid that you suggest that they use the Metro! Just the thought of Public Transportation to some people makes them feel like middle class. We wouldn't want any of our rich ass subscribers to think that they are one of us. I need to find a new job, and I am working on it.  So, when someone calls to bitch about parking to me I can tell them to just kiss my ass.

       I think I get off on getting revenge on people, especially when it involves doing something naughty.&nbsp; It's the most amazing feeling when you do something like that.&nbsp; More specifically, if the other person doesn't even know you did anything.&nbsp; A lot of people like to talk and whisper behind people's back but I like to use action to get my satisfaction.&nbsp; Most people don't know the range of my craziness and how far I will really go to feel that satisfaction.&nbsp; I'll do it, and if you cross me, you will wish your mama never gave it up to your Daddy.&nbsp;

       urlLink    So, I'm bored, sitting at home and just taking it easy. I decided to take advantage of On Demand, and find something interesting to watch. I stumbled upon Real Sex on HBO. Right now I am watching the making of a male sex doll that has interchangeable penises. The doll even has a pump that jizzes on you. And for only $7,999.99 you can have one of your own. It sounds great and all, doesn't talk, doesn't smell, and he'll always be ready when you are and for as long as your little heart desires. There's only one issue that I have with this. There are very few women out there that can't find sex if they really needed it. There aren't very many single men out there that would deny a woman sex if she demanded it. Unless you have buck teeth, a lazy eye, more hair on your ass then on your head, and you smell like the daily catch down at the local fish market you have a pretty good chance of getting laid. Now, don't get me wrong, if I had an excess amount of money I would probably buy one. Who wouldn't love to just smack that dummy around and watch that silicone giggle?  There was also a segment all about people who get off about pretending to be a horse. Now this was just weird. I am very openminded when it comes to the subject of sex, but I guess this justing isn't my thing (which I am very happy about.) They would get all dressed up, saddles and all. Then they would get on each other's shoulders and gallop around the field. The thing that disturbed me the most was the horse sounds that they were making. I couldn't get behind that. The sound just disturbed me. It's something that you really have to see to understand. I thought that I was complicated because I like to use a vibrator, at least I don't need to wear a saddle and reins to get off. &nbsp; urlLink

        So, I did some apartment looking today.&nbsp; Things like this make me wish that I just gave in and moved in with my parents again when I graduated college.&nbsp; Living in this area of MD isn't helping the situation either.&nbsp; You either pay out of your ass, or you have to watch our ass so you don't get shot.&nbsp; Take your pick.&nbsp; The place that I live now, being white means that you are in the very small minority.&nbsp; I have nothing against people of color, whether they are red cause I smacked them in the face or green cause I kicked them in the stomach.&nbsp; I dated a big black man for a while ( taking a moment to reminisce *sigh*).&nbsp; In my opinion you can't sleep with someone&nbsp;outside your race and still be called a racist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So anyway, back to what I was saying.&nbsp; If you step outside of my apartment, it's like stepping into  Westside Story,  minus the cool dance numbers and snazzy finger snapping, (they use their fingers for other things around here).&nbsp; On one side you have the black people that play Jay-Z and 50cent at high volumes, and on the opposite side you have the Latino lovers that play Latin music as loud as their Walmart stereos can go.&nbsp; Surprisingly it's pretty loud.&nbsp; The most unfortunate part is the music has the beat of bongos over-layed with the sound of a cat in heat and being skinned at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it could be worst, they could all be playing country music.

       One day I am going to be old.&nbsp; One day you are gonna be old.&nbsp; One day we will both be dead.&nbsp; How scary is that.&nbsp; What's there to look forward to?&nbsp; Now there is something to think about when you are lying awake in bed at night and can't go to sleep.&nbsp; And I bet you hate me now.&nbsp; Well this is what I have to say about that; welcome to my world, BITCH!

      Have you ever wanted to be someone else?&nbsp; Not like a celebrity or any of those crazy people, but just someone that you run into on a day to day basis.&nbsp; It could be a co-worker or the neighbor down the street.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I ask, have you ever wanted to be someone else, I don't mean forever.&nbsp; Maybe a few hours or a week or two.&nbsp; Just enough time to experience what they are.&nbsp; Interact with the people they know, have sex with their lover, understand their emotions.&nbsp; That would be a great performance piece if someone could figure out how to do it.&nbsp; They would be in the Hirshorn in an instant.&nbsp; If there was a way to pull it off you could know if your life really sucks,&nbsp;or if everything was just a facade.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my random thought of the day.&nbsp;

         I hear a lot of stories from people, of all the great adventures and things that they have recently done.&nbsp; I stop and think, " What's the last fun and exciting thing I've done?" (that's me thinking) And when I can't think of the last time I did anything remotely adventurous I get sad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sad like, " Boo Hoo," sad, but more like, "what the fucking am I doing !" sad.&nbsp; Just a few years ago&nbsp; I can remember all these crazy ass things that I did, like make out with my female friend for money in bars, and smile.&nbsp; Now all I do is work at a job that pays me the wage of Russian cheese packer, and go home.&nbsp; I am 23, yet&nbsp;I feel like my life has fast forwarded to 43, minus the perks of having a good paying job.&nbsp; Maybe I had so much fun when I was in college that I used up all my "fun points", and now I am destined to never experience that level of fun again.&nbsp; Or God hates me, one or the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I should start over, the temptation is always there.&nbsp; Get up one day and move to California.&nbsp;&nbsp; The unfortunate part is I have no money and I would be homeless in 2 weeks if I did that.&nbsp; But it would be exciting.&nbsp; Maybe I should do what my sister did.&nbsp; Find some older man on the internet that lives on the other side of the country.&nbsp; Run off with him leaving my friends and my family and just fuck him all day and never have to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound good to me.  &nbsp; Sometimes I think about starting to work on my art again.&nbsp; Maybe that will help me, and get me where I want to be.&nbsp; " That's a great idea!" ( that's me thinking again.)&nbsp; But what do I want to say, and who will give a fuck?&nbsp; I&nbsp; have nothing to say and no one will care.&nbsp; Damnit, I should have gone to grad school, what was I thinking?&nbsp; At least then my mind wouldn't be moosh from doing mindless tasks all day for people who don't care.&nbsp; To quote the scarecrow, " If&nbsp;I only had a brain."        &nbsp;

      I decided this year that I would plant a small vegetable garden.  It's something that my dad has always done since as long as I can remember.  I thought that it would be a great little project for me, and the results would taste good too.  Last night I went to take the dog out for a pee and I decided to look and see how the progress was going.  There was about 5 tomatoes that morning,that were of good size, but magically they had seemed to disappear.  In the area that I live there are unfortunately a lot of kids.  And what is even more unfortunate is that these kids have no supervision or guidance from any of the adults.  It turns out that these kids decided that it would a great idea to steal all the tomatoes and smash them on the sidewalk a few feet away.  Now growing up, I was taught that I should respect other people's property and things.  But apparently now a days that doesn't seem to matter.  I have spent a lot of time, effort and money on these plants, and I am not willing to give it up because of some fucked up kid.  You would also think that if you talked to the parents of the children then they would straighten them out.  But they don't give a fuck about their children, sometimes I wonder if they even know their kids' names.  All they do is sit on their ass and say that they are not responsible for their kids' actions.  Wait till the social workers come banging on their door, we will see if their tone changes.  When it comes down to it, it's not really the kids fault if they don't know any better.  But goddamnit, leave my motherfucking tomatoes alone.

      Yesterday I woke up late, but amazingly still decided to make it to work.  On my one hour journey to work, give or take a few minutes, I saw one of the many signs that the world would soon come to an end.  As I was driving down North Capitol in the middle of D.C. coming from the opposite direction I saw the monstrosity that we call a Hummer.  Inside this Hummer was a man in a business suit holding a Starbucks cup and trying to talk on the phone at the same time.  What I found even more amusing was as he cruised on by he swerved into the neighboring lane so he could avoid a pot hole.  Now, these vehicles were originally used in military combat, but this guy thinks that a pot hole might ruin he traction.  When you see one of these cars (and I use that term loosely) you think that Indiana Jones and all his buds are riding in it, not some D.C. business man that has more money then his ass can hold.  I am not one of those activist that want to save the whales and the dolphins and all the other cute animals, but driving one of those things in the middle of a city in just a blinding disregard for everything.

       * circa 1969  This is a passage from a book that Mike mysteriously found laying around. I thought it was too good not to share with everyone. The following passage is a tale from a prostitute explaining how she started turning trick:  "First of all, don't think I'm making excuses. I know what I'm doing and I like it- I could quit anytime. I started screwing when I was fourteen. In the crummy hick town where I grew up there wasn't anything else to do. By the time I was seventeen I'd laid every john in the country. I wasn't a hustler then- I mean I'd let 'em take me out to dinner and all that , but I just did it for kicks. I got married when I was 18 and we moved to the city-boy, what a jerk he was! After six months, I left him and got a job in a bar. There wasn't much to do so I started screwing around again. We have a couple of hookers working the bar and I got friendly with them. One day they said to me,"Jesus, what're you giving it away for? You want to put us out of business?" After closing time that night we went out for a few drinks together and they laid it out for me. I tried in a couple of times with guys they sent over and it wasn't so bad. I mean, I get paid for what I was throwing away before and the johns get what they want, so everybody is happy."  Author of the book commenting: " Unfortunately Rhonda missed one point: in prostitution, nobody's happy.

       I need a nap. I'm so tired that I can't do anything . I especially can't do any work. I am stuck here for an other 2 1/2 hours, and just the though of that makes me wanna crawl under my desk and cry. I have to be a good example in front of the associates, because they have impressionable young minds. Just say no to drugs and don't smoke. We should start a D.A.R.E. program in the office, but instead of saying drugs are bad we should promote them. The first thing you would do in the morning is warm a bowl, and then as the day progressed you would increasing take more and more potent drugs. By the end of the day you'll have track marks down to your ass. It would make working in this environment a lot more bearable. My boyfriend just called and told me that I need to give him more blowjobs. Fuck That!! What about my needs?? Typical.

       I've made a new goal for myself. I've decided to try becoming a lesbian. Ok, well maybe not a full fledged one, but if I end up breaking up with Ben in the next month or so I may just have to go all the way. Surprisingly, there is actually a good possibility of that. On my  Friendster  profile I have changed my status to single and looking to date women. I did this a few days ago and so far I have gotten two responses. One from a woman that said we have a lot of similarities in common,which right off the bat freaked me out, cause why would I want to date someone like me? The second one was a 10 on the scale of freakiness. The picture that she has on her profile sent chills down my spine. I can honestly say that she looks like a crack head. On top of that she wanted me to be her roommate when she moved to D.C. next month. As Nate eloquently put it, "don't let her go down on you.....She might not come back up ," yikes! I've always had fantasies about woman, I think that we'll just keep it at that for now.   If anyone knows any good lesbians  around, lemme know.  At the very least we can become very close friends.

       So last night was the first of a week of nights that I was alone.  I didn't know what to do with myself.  I hadn't been alone in such a long time.  So I did what anyone else would do.  I watched porn and went to sleep.

       My head hurts and I don't know why. I also think I am getting sick. I can taste it in the back of my throat. Ben is gone.   The other day I looked out of my living room window to the apartment across the way. There were about 3 people standing outside smoking pot at 2 in the afternoon. I have nothing against pot, God knows it's helped me out, but gimme a break.   I will be sleeping alone for the next week. Ben is working overnight because of the Jewish Olympic games for pre-pubescent teenagers. They need someone to be there 24/7 in case of an emergency. Basically he's gonna get paid to sleep. I've never slept alone in my apartment before. It's gonna be weird. I feel like I should have an orgy, but that seems like too much effort to put together. He wants me to bring him a pillow, at the same time  Six Feet Under  is gonna be on. Which one do I pick? The boyfriend of 3+ years or the show. It's a hard decision that's gonna take some time.   I had a dream last night that no one wanted to have sex with me. It was kinda of depressing. Then I awake to Ben poking me with his memeber, and I tell him I'm not in the mood. How ironic is that, I got so depressed from my dream I didn't want to have sex.   Speaking of sex, I am on the hunt for a new piece of jewelry for my hood piercing. Preferably one that can do tricks, if anyone knows of a place, lemme know. The End.

       When I was driving to work today, after I spent the morning having an emotional breakdown, I saw something inspiring. As I was waiting at a light on North Capitol I saw this woman on a bench wearing earphones and listening to music. She was so overcome by the music it seemed like she was in her own little world. She was flailing her arms and stomping her feet to the beat of the music while swaying back and forth. It was to a level of a spiritual experience. She had this passion within her and she just had to let it out. She didn't care who was around her, or what anyone thought of her enthusiasm, all that mattered was she was listening. I sat in my car and watched her for the whole 3 minutes I sat there. It was mesmerizing. I actually began to envy her. I don't have that kind of passion in my life right now about anything. She has so much of it that even listening to her favorite song can't enclose it. I'm probably just making a big deal of of nothing, but watching that woman on the bench has been the best part of my day.

       I've talked to a lot of people today. They all know my name, and that scares me. Although, now that I think about it the majority of them think my name is Lula, so it can't be all that bad. They have become my "pets", as we like to call them in the office. Subscribers that will ask for me by name until the day I quit. Sooner rather then latter, lets hope. I wake up in the morning and think to myself, "who will I befriend today?" I actually have an Excel spreadsheet that tells me all about my pets. Who they are,why they are mad at me, and what dates they don't want to see me. It's like have 50 firbies all lined up ready to charge at you, except I can't take the batteries out of these. Sometimes, they get SO upset with me that they don't want to be my pet anymore and ask to have someone else care for them. That's usually fine with me. They say that there have been studies that show if you own a pet you will live longer and have lower blood pressure. If that's the case I have enough pets to live forever right now. The unfortunate thing is I think they are giving me an ulcer. But who can complain about an ulcer if you are gonna live forever, right?

       Last night I had a dream that was on the side of being very weird. It involved Ben (my boyfriend) and it involved Ben but a different version. I was cheating on Ben with an other version of Ben. This probably doesn't make sense to you but very little things that come out of my dreams do. It was also set at my parents house, which I haven't lived in since I left for college. All I really remember is trying to get the "better" version of Ben out the door before the "not so great version", came home. I guess Ben shouldn't really get mad that I dreamed about cheating on him. He should be flattered that I think so much of him that my subconscious had to create an other one. It was very interesting, and I think I'll just leave it at that .
