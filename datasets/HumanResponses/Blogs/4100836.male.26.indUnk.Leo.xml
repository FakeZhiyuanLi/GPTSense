       1-Finding a job, (not necessarily an appropriate one) is my major concern these days .I’m looking forward to a job that can help my family’s economy. I have bought some law and literature dictionaries to translate texts to earn money. I’m an optimist person and I think that with the help of god I may find a good job.    2-One of my friend is engaged with a girl recently. I can’t help laughing to such cases for I defy Iranian style marriages. Iranian marriages have a very long history of complexes and paradoxes that I will write about them as soon as possible.  3-Talking rude with parents is a very bad behavior that I committed it today when my mother insisted on talking about our cousins in Boroojerd. I don’t love them and so I talked with my mother in a very rude manner. She is a very nice and lovely person and forgot all the matter hours later and showed that she had forgiven me. I love her!  4-Just a little about politics! I think that US cannot destroy Islamic Republic of Iran by any military means. They should use cultural means. That results in victory. Maybe!

       Tomorrow I will travel to Lorestan province for some educational issues.    Maybe I won’t be able to update my blog for 3 or 4 days.  I’m so sorry about this matter!  Bye!

       1-This interim government is a real puppet. I don’t think that Bremer’s could serve US as much as Alavi does. Killing a group of patriot people in the most sacred cities of Moslems is a barbaric act that everyone will remember it. Suppose that all these clashes happen in US. How would Americans react? Iraqis should understand that us wants to swallow their natural resources and no democracy is available.  2-Today is my birthday! I congratulate this holly anniversary to myself and all the readers of this blog! I don’t think that the forthcoming year is a peaceful one! In Persian calendar I was born in 1357. Now I’m 26 years old!  3-Orkut! Orkut! Orkut! I wish that tonight their server will be awake and I find what is happening out there!  4-I will post 2 pictures one of them sexy and the other one beautiful to show you my comparison and contrast of these two important matters.

       1-What a glamorous and gorgeous opening ! I couldn't believe that Greeks could afford and perform such a disciplined ceremony!The fireplays were terrific and there was also an excellent parade.The fashions were so beautiful that any other fashion shows seems nothing comparing.    I hope we have a very fantasting and exciting  urlLink olympic games .    2-There are 2 kinds of translation :   a-Literary translation  b-Other translations(scientific,jurnalistic,etc.)  In literary translation we deal with the hidden meaning of the text while in technical translation we just interprete the surface meaning of the text. For example, if a Briton wants to translate the poems of Hafez, he will face a very hard job than translating Kayhan articles.  3-MKO relations with Saddam regime (and Clinton administration) has an endless  urlLink story .  4-There is a tiny  urlLink site  that Atlanta living Iranians has designed.There are forums and other sections in which they provide local news of Atlanta and their motherland.

       So sorry for a few days absence! 1-Iranian consul in Karbala, Iraq is kidnapped but he is alive and the kidnappers released a video tape showing him healthy and demanded Iran's neutrality in Iraq's events. &nbsp;&nbsp; a-I believe thet this kidnapping (not hostage taking, because the militias asked for nothing and didn't threat the consul) is correlated and coordinated by USA .Why? &nbsp;&nbsp; US thinks that Iran is opposed to the invasion of Iraq and defies any American role in Iraq.Correct. &nbsp;&nbsp; Washington thinks that Iran helps militias (especially shias )by providing them amunition .Incorrect.&nbsp; Iran needs a calm and stable Iraq and supports any situation that brings the power back to hands of the Iraqi people whom 62% of them are shias like Iranians. Moreover there is a sufficient amount of gun and weapon for Iraqis that they need no foreign support (remember that Saddam provided his nation weapon when Americans stormed Iraq.) &nbsp;&nbsp; So Washington wants to punish Tehran as it forms an unkown militia group and gives them infos about the consul and prepares them for the show off.Us tries to inform Iran that it cannot bear and resist arming shias and spoiling US plans in Iraq. &nbsp; b- There is one more theory.These militias who kidnapped the consul , if they are not Iranmade ones , are supported and informed by Iranians themselves to kidnap their consul on purpose.Why? If you want to spoil a truth, you try to attach it to a bad man as his idea.If we consider this idea that Iran helps factional clashes and tries to influence Iraqis and provokes secterian wars we can make it publicised and reclaimed by kidnappers who are condemned by everyone.So the true idea is spoiled .From now on,Iran can increase whatever had done in Iraq and also condemn US for helping militias kidnap his consul. 2-MKO relations with Saddam and also America is a very long  urlLink story  that seems to have no end.

       1-Why do I write weblog? This critical question was the result of 2 matters:           a-I want to present my ideas.     b-There is no comment !       I don't want to write weblog just to recieve comments and be famous. Also, I don't want to write a desrted weblog .So what should I do?       95% of Iranian webloggers use  urlLink Persianblog  services to create their own weblog.To publicize thier weblogs,Iranians visit blogs of eachother and in comments write something good about that blog and type their own blog address and "  visit me ". This is the key phrase and the only purpose to write a comment for that blog.In persian style weblogs, the most important thing is the counter. It is obvious that it should be as high as possible.       What is written in the blog has no importance.I don't like this type of weblogging so I decided to write comments on my favorite blogs just for the sake of writing my comments and not to propagand my blog.    2- urlLink Irdown  is a very good download site because it presents new and useful sofwares and their cracks too!!    3-Remeber that MKO?  urlLink Irandidban  is a very good site to find some interesting and shocking truth about this terrorist group.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;  1-    ITC    (Information Technology Channel) is an LA based sattelite channel which broadcasts several programs on different subjects like weblog,adobe premiere,networking,cakewalk and....This channel is unique for I don't remember any other channels that try to educate people in this general way and the important point is that it is a FREE channel !!

       &nbsp;&nbsp; 1-It seems like that winning presidential campaigns justifies implementing any posible trick for this Mr. Bush. Publicizing 3 year old infos about Al Qaeda threats just during&nbsp;the&nbsp;campaigns shows how nasty&nbsp;, coward and power greedy is Bush administration.   &nbsp;&nbsp; 2-You don't know what an interesting and calming feeling&nbsp;I experienced just when Iran lost the game against China in penalty kicks . Shoutings , applauses , everything regarding a patriotic fan faded away&nbsp;and a soothing&nbsp;atmosphere replaced it. We cannot go to&nbsp;the&nbsp;final&nbsp;match and there is no need to worry about footbal and our team.That's it !!   &nbsp;&nbsp; 3-Those who are interested in literature may find&nbsp; urlLink IPL  an interesting source.   &nbsp;&nbsp; 4-There are sites for wallpaper that need registeration but this one has such&nbsp; urlLink HQ  wallz that registeration is ok!!

       &nbsp; 1-MKO (mojahedin e khalgh organization) is a very dangerous terrorist group that were so dependent to saddam's power. They killed anyone whom they thought could serve Iran regime.    &nbsp; Now they are surrounded to americans in Iraq.Everything seems ok.The shocking fact is that americans ,as the blood enemy of Iran,are thinking about giving help to this terrorist group.Think about  Double Standards !!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;2-Once upon a time, there was a civilized minister whom his followers believed him as the statue of tolerance and modernism.Years passed and our hero resigned and stayed at home with his dear wife.Gradually some news spread that he has  6  wives.One of them is brave enough to publicize the matter and ask&nbsp;for&nbsp;her rights .They say that he will pay a europe travel to shut her mouth!!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;3-I think that  urlLink skins  is on of the best sites for wallpaper!!!
