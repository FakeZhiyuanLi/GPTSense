      Well, it's hot.  It's really freakin' hot.  It's almost 11 and it's still in the high 20's and tomorrow it's supposed to be 40 bloody degrees.  I hate summer.  I hate the heat.  I hate humidity.  Did I say that it's really friggin' hot???  Exciting week ... I get to do a live radio interview on Thursday am (around 8:10am PST on www.kbsradio.ca if you feel like listening in).  Friday, I get to do another interview with the local TV station and wouldn't you know it, I have a mongo zit in the middle of my forehead.  So, I get to go on TV (something I hate) which adds millions of pounds and everyone gets to see my mongo zit.  Gee, I can't possibly think of anything more fun than that :)  Well, it's hotter than heck and I have to try and get some sleep.  I shall write more tomorrow and hopefully I will be in a better mood.  Night!   Current Read:  Harry Potter, Book #4 (still waiting for my new books to come in)

      Well, it's about 11pm and it's still in the high 20's  (Celsius) .  I think I may just melt into a little puddle all over the floor.  The sad thing is that my apartment building is air conditioned and it's  still  unbearably hot!  Someone told me today that this is the longest heat spell here since the 80's!  Update:  Well, I am now famous ... strange people keep coming up to me on the street saying,  "I saw you on tv!" .  As you can tell, I am most excited about this    .  And to make matters better, I get to do another interview shortly ... oh goody gumdrops!      Well, it's late and I'm hot and grumpy.  So, I shall take myself to bed to read until I can no longer keep my eyes open.  Night all!   Current Read:  Harry Potter, Book #3 ... I'm waiting for books I have on order to come in!

      Haven't posted in a few days ... I have been babysitting my sister's kidlets.  She had to make a rush trip to Calgary, and I had a few days off.  Right now, I am on my lunch break from work (yes, Saturday shift ... blegh!).  Necy will be home tomorrow ... I have spent the last 2 days spoiling the kids rotten!  Letting them eat junk and everything ... I love being a Tia (aunty, portugeuse)!  Well, I suppose I should eat something and then go back to work!  Hope you're all having a good weekend.

       Irreverent:   lacking proper respect or seriousness  So, my sister say's that I am irreverent  (see yesterday's blog if you are confuzzled by this statement) .  I much prefer the word  Impious :  lacking due respect .  So, yeah ... I have a terrible sense of humour.  I find some pretty scandalous things funny ... but that's me!  Like it or lump it, baby!  (Thanks http://www.m-w.com for the definitions!)    It was definetely hot again today.  The air conditioning, at work, decided not to work today ... it was 80 degrees faranheit in the store and it was almost unbearable!  Even the girls who are always freezing were complaining about the heat!  First thing I did after work today was have a freezing cold shower.   It felt glorious!!!   I am off tomorrow and looking forward to sleeping in and vegging in my air conditioned apartment!  Well, I should go and make myself some supper ... Have a good night everyone!   (PS ... Minty & Squiggles, hurry up and send sister package.  What's taking you so long?????)

      "The sun will be darkened, the moon will be turned red as blood" (Joel 2:31)  Tonight, the moon is red ... red as blood.  So repent, all you sinners, for the end is upon us!  My thought for the day.  Possibly the sun and heat have caused permanent brain damage.  You be the judge!

      Today was a quiet day ... worked all day.  It was super hot here today.  By 9 it was already over 20 degrees.  It seems that the forest fires surrounding us make the heat even worse.  I find it very difficult to eat when it is this hot!  Anyways, I am off to check my email and then early to bed.  Maybe I will have something more interesting to write tomorrow!  Current Read:  The Saxon Shore by Jack Whyte (book 4 of A Dream of Eagles series).  A very good series ... I highly recommend it!

      Took this funny quiz on what kind of threat I am to the Bush administration ... here's the results:    Threat rating: High. The Bush administration is concerned that it may not get a second term. Therefore, we are going to change the rules so that each Democrat vote only counts as 0.2 votes because Democrat is a shorter word than Republican    urlLink   What threat to the Bush administration are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I found this amusing ... had to share!

      Happy Saturday everyone!  Today, I am a domestic goddess ... I made 4 casseroles this morning, to freeze, so I won't starve.  I really hate this whole cooking for only me thing.  I am just meant to feed more than 1 person!  Had fun with my nephew last night ... we went to McD's for some dinner then to the mall to pick up some groceries & wander around.  He played in the ball room for a bit too.  It's funny, because I talk to him constantly when we are out-and-about ... I find it a natural/normal thing to do.  But, I get the funniest looks from people.  Maybe they figure that because he is young he cannot understand, so what is the point of talking to him????  I just don't know!  He understands me ... and besides, it keeps him calm and relaxed.  Well, I should get my ass off the computer and into the shower!  Hope you are all having a good weekend!

          I'm kind of excited ... tomorrow night I get to bbsit my 23 month old nephew  (he is the one that I talked about yesterday, who has me wrapped around his little finger ).  I think we will go to the ballroom :)     I am still agonizing over my tv interview today.  To make it worse, it is going to air Thurs to Sun every freakin' half hour.  ARRRRGGHHH!     Quiet night tonight ... I am feeling tired and I think I shall retire to bed shortly.  Goodnight!

       Lesson of the Day:  Some people just shouldn't be on TV!!!!  And I am one of those.  I had to do an interview today, with the local tv station, for this volunteer job I am doing.  It was  terrible !  I completely balked the whole thing ... my palms got sweaty, my knees knocked, and worst of all my mind went completely blank!  The guy interviewing me was standing less than a foot away with this huge camera in my face, firing questions at me.  Thank God for editing!  Well, I'm off to work ... back to the grind.  More later!  Hope you all have a wonderful summer day.

      When I got home today, I checked my viocemail (as I always do) and there was a message from my sister ... My 23 month old nephew left me a message too! It really made my day. That boy has me wrapped around his little finger so tight! I am such a sucker for him ...  Had a good dinner with my sister last night. We went to BP and I enjoyed a good drink (something ending with "-ITA). It was a slushy boozy drink with peach juice, peach schnapps and rum ... YUMMY! Dumb moment of the night: Went to pay, couldn't find bank card. Where is bankcard? Sitting in front of computer where I had been using to check my bank balance before leaving. Good thing sister had enough $$ to buy my dinner too. DUH! Thanks, sister, for bailing me out!  Interesting day at work today ... one of my coworkers tried to guilt someone into taking one of her shifts.  She even turned on the waterworks.  Just one more example of why I love my job so much!

      I got a really nice compliment at work today!  (Which is a nice change, since lately I have been getting hit on and asked out by some pretty   disgusting "men")  This gentleman was in my store today and he says to me, "You are always smiling whenever I see you, what's your secret?" Then he proceeded to tell me that I have a nice smile ... I told him that it is because I am a happy person.  Then, after work when I was driving home, I drove by him and he hollers, "See, there it is again!"  It was kind of sweet.  There was this older gentleman in my store today  (not the smile guy)  who had on a cologne that made me feel rather nostalgic.  Whatever it was that he was wearing, reminded me of my dad.  So, I coudln't help but sniff everytime he walked by ... I know it sounds silly, but there is something about some scents that can trigger my thoughts and emotions.  Well, I am off to my sister's ... we are going out for dinner  (I think) .  She is home alone with 3 kids and needs some serious "kid-free" time!  And, since my sister is one of my bestest friends, I never mind spending time with her.  Hope you are enjoying my posts so far ... I am determined to learn more about blogging and fix it so I have some links and a comment section.  Wish me luck!

      So, I'm volunteering with this group and doing some publicity stuff for them.  This is my first try at this ... so today I had this meeting with a local media group.  Oh my, the guy I was meeting had absolutely ZERO personal skills.  My meeting was scheduled for 10am, I arrived 5 minutes early to be informed  (by the guy)  that he was expecting a conference call and could I come back in an hour.  How rude!  He could have called me sometime before that, but no.  So, I went off to my sister's for a visit and to wait.  I go back at 10:58 and told to come back in 15, he's still on the phone!  So, I sit in my car & read my book, waiting!  Finally, I meet with the guy ...  took only 5 minutes .  Boy was I cheezed!  But, this media group is sponsoring some good publicity $$ so I guess it was worth all the hassle.  Next stop, the local tv station.  ARGGHH!

      My 4 day weekend is just ripping past!  It's already Sunday.  I know I must be getting old, because I have been up late the last two nights in a row and I feel poopered out!  I don't know how people stay up to 3am or later and still function the next day.  In order to function, after stayin up that late, I must sleep until the afternoon.  The wedding I attended was just beautiful!  The bride wrote the ceremony herself (except for the must have legal bits).  It was a very simple ceremony and very befitting to the bride & groom.   CONGRATULATIONS KIMBERLY & DARRYL!   Well, I need to go and have a shower, get dressed and clean house.  Hope everyone is enjoying their long-weekend.

      I just thought I would put up a quick post ... tomorrow is day 1 of a 4 day weekend and I plan on being super busy!  I am going out tonight for coffee, going out for a drink tomorrow night, have a wedding to attend on Saturday, etc.  Some good news today: The event that I have been doing public relations for is a complete sell-out!  That is after releasing an extra 50 tickets last week!  Tickets were slated to be on sale until Sept 12th!!!!  I am super happy about that!  Well, I am off to go off coffee.  I may not write during the weekend, so have a good long-weekend (for all you canucks) and a good weekend for everyone else!

      I had the strangest dream last night ... dreamed about Brandt.  He was my best friend in grade 2 or 3, but moved away at the end of the year and I never heard anything about him again.  Woke up this am wondering what ever happened to him.  I remember being scared for him, because his family life was the shits and his lunchbox got broken while we were playing in the rockery.  I remember that he was absolutely terrified of going home that day.   SIGH   It is really too bad how we make friends in life and then lose touch with them.

      I'm terribly sad.  This weekend will be the last weekend the drive-in ever plays.  Then it will be torn down to make way for progress (a.k.a. Walmart).  I have a lot of memories of the drive in ... movies that I never watched (hee hee), the time we snuck a bunch of people in by hiding them in the vehicle ... I'm going to miss the drive-in.   That's my thought for this morning.

      Favourite quote from last night:  "Honey, you have never seen  bitchy  until you've seen a fag bitchy!"   Picture this said by one of my gay friends as he stands with his hands on his hips.  Made me giggle.

      Have you ever had one of those days when you just want to throttle one of your coworkers???  I so had one of those today!  I went to work in a good mood and this BITCH (I don't swear often on my blog, but there is no other word I can use to describe her) ruined that rather quickly.  She has this attitude, you know the one "I'm always right and only my way is the right way".  Funny, considering at her last review she was told that she only had 50% product knowledge, yet she thinks that she knows everything.  I don't know how someone who really does so little work, can act as if she is god's gift to the employer.  Anyways, that is my rant for the day!  I am off to find some dinner and go to a meeting!  Happy Monday ;)

      Went out last night to the stagette party of a girlfriend.  God, I haven't been out to the bar in a very long time!  I had a really good time ... it was fun to hang out with her, since we don't get to see eachother very often!  Poor thing had to wear a tiara/cape/gloves all night with a "cock" (soap on a rope) hanging around her waist.  Luckily, she was a good sport about it!  Thank you to a certain bouncer who put a smile on my face and flattered me ;)  Saddened to hear today of the passing of an aquaintance, who was very nice to me.  My thoughts and prayers are with you Miriam and your family.  And thank you Ed for your wisdom, even though you are not here to know you have imparted it to me.  Had a nice chat with a drunken crew in K-Town tonight.  It was nice to talk to them all, makes me miss them though!  Can't wait to see them all again.  Went grocery shopping today and then visited with Necy & kidlets while doing some laundry.  I am very tired tonight, after being up so late last-night.  So, I shall head to bed now.  Night readers!

      Just got news, Jacob will be well enough to go home soon.  The outcome of his fall was a broken ear drum and several contusions of the brain.  They had to induce him into a coma for a while so that he would not cause more damage by fighting the doctors and treatment.  At this point, the doctors are recommending lots of rest and healing.  The only unknown factor will be what, if any, damage his brain injury will bring about.  Only time will tell on that.  Once again, thank you to everyone for their continuous prayers for Jacob and his family!

      Today was terribly exciting ... I worked.  I stayed late at work to finish some back to school orders.  I came home, I worked some more (job #2).  I went to a meeting that dragged on and on and on and on ... well, you get the point!  Then I went for coffee with 2 guys from the meeting, to have a bitch session about how bad the meeting was!  Isn't that exciting?  Oh yeah, I saw the smily guy tonight!  He smiled and waved :)  Guess I'll have to start calling him the smiling, waving guy!  Next time I see him I am going to ask his name.  There was a voicemail message from my sister saying she has heard more about Jacob, but it was too late to call her back.  So, I'll post tomorrow as soon as I find out what the news is.  Well, it's really freaking late and I must go to bed or I shall be an absolute hag tomorrow. NO, I'M NOT A HAG EVERYDAY!  IT HURTS ME THAT YOU THINK I AM :(  Goodnight readers!

      I received this via email and I just had to share.  Warning ... it's long!  Go CANADA!  You live next door to a clean-cut, quiet guy. He never plays loud music or throws raucous parties. He doesn't gossip over the fence, just smiles politely and offers you some tomatoes. His lawn is cared-for, his house is neat as a pin and you get the feeling he doesn't always lock his front door. He wears Dockers. You hardly know he's there.   And then one day you discover that he has pot in his basement, spends his weekends at peace marches and that guy you've seen mowing the yard is his spouse.   Allow me to introduce Canada.   The Canadians are so quiet that you may have forgotten they're up there, but they've been busy doing some surprising things. It's like discovering that the mice you are dimly aware of in your attic have been building an espresso machine.   Did you realize, for example, that our reliable little tag-along brother never joined the Coalition of the Willing? Canada wasn't willing, as it turns out, to join the fun in Iraq. I can only assume American diner menus weren't angrily changed to include "freedom bacon," because nobody here eats the stuff anyway.   And then there's the wild drug situation: Canadian doctors are authorized to dispense medical marijuana. Parliament is considering legislation that would not exactly legalize marijuana possession, as you may have heard, but would reduce the penalty for possession of under 15 grams to a fine, like a speeding ticket. This is to allow law enforcement to concentrate resources on traffickers; if your garden is full of wasps, it's smarter to go for the nest rather than trying to swat every individual bug. Or, in the United States, bong.   Now, here's the part that I, as an American, can't understand. These poor benighted pinkos are doing everything wrong. They have a drug problem: Marijuana offenses have doubled since 1991. And Canada has strict gun control laws, which means that the criminals must all be heavily armed, the law-abiding civilians helpless and the government on the verge of a massive confiscation campaign. (The laws have been in place since the '70s, but I'm sure the government will get around to the confiscation eventually.)  They don't even have a death penalty!   And yet .. nationally, overall crime in Canada has been declining since 1991. Violent crimes fell 13 percent in 2002. Of course, there are still crimes committed with guns -- brought in from the United States, which has become the major illegal weapons supplier for all of North America -- but my theory is that the surge in pot-smoking has rendered most criminals too relaxed to commit violent crimes. They're probably more focused on shoplifting boxes of Ho-Hos from convenience stores.   And then there's the most reckless move of all: Just last month, Canada decided to allow and recognize same-sex marriages. Merciful moose, what can they be thinking? Will there be married Mounties (they always get their man!)? Dudley Do-Right was sweet on Nell, not Mel! We must be the only ones who really care about families. Not enough to make sure they all have health insurance, of course, but more than those libertines up north.   This sort of behavior is a clear and present danger to all our stereotypes about Canada. It's supposed to be a cold, wholesome country of polite, beer-drinking hockey players, not founded by freedom-fighters in a bloody revolution but quietly assembled by loyalists and royalists more interested in order and good government than liberty and independence.   But if we are the rugged individualists, why do we spend so much of our time trying to get everyone to march in lockstep? And if Canadians are so reserved and moderate, why are they so progressive about letting people do what they want to?   Canadians are, as a nation, less religious than we are, according to polls. As a result, Canada's government isn't influenced by large, well-organized religious groups and thus has more in common with those of Scandinavia than those of the United States, or, say, Iran.   Canada signed the Kyoto global warming treaty, lets 19-year-olds drink, has more of its population living in urban areas and accepts more immigrants per capita than the United States. These are all things we've been told will wreck our society. But I guess Canadians are different, because theirs seems oddly sound.   Like teenagers, we fiercely idolize individual freedom but really demand that everyone be the same. But the Canadians seem more adult -- more secure. They aren't afraid of foreigners. They aren't afraid of homosexuality. Most of all, they're not afraid of each other.   I wonder if America will ever be that cool.

      The response that I received from my call for prayer has been a real eye-opener.  Even those in my life that I may consider to be  'not very religious'  were quick to respond that they would keep Jacob and his family in their thoughts and prayers.  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who is praying for Jacob and his family.  My sister and I appreciate it, and I am sure that his family appreciates it too.  I will post news of Jacob as soon as I hear anything.  Goodnight.

      I just got startling news, that the son of my sister's best friend has had a fall and sustained serious head injuries.  He is in ICU and it is not looking good.  So, please, if you can, say a little prayer for Jacob and his family for me.  Thank you.  Goodnight.

      You are prolly asking yourself what my finger has to do with my upstairs neighbour ... the answer is nothing!  I think my upstairs neighbour is kind of creepy.  He really weirds me out and I avoid him at all costs.  I jammed my finger in the door at work yesterday and I have this really big ugly bruise and I think I may have sprained it ... :(  Poor me!  Yay!  I'm off tomorrow ... Tomorrow is my nephew's 2nd birthday!  Well, that's all I have to share.  Goodnight :)

      OMG yesterday was super busy!  It's back to school time at work right now which = absolutely bloody crazy!  It means parent's stressing, children whining and craziness.  Got home, managed to cook some supper (this whole weekly menu thingy is really helping) then spent the rest of the night working on stuff for my youth kidlets ... I know that my first meeting isn't for a month, but if I don't start on it now I'll be stressing closer to the date.  I'm trying to find some new ideas for doing group building and I'm hoping to find some new material on leadership training.  So this means hunting through books and the net.  Sent out copious amounts of emails to my youth kidlets.  Wrote up the minutes from my Tuesday meeting and emailed them off ... so yeah, it was a busy Wednesday!  Well, I am off to get ready for work ... Have a good day!

      The girls at work are determined (putting it lightly) to fix me up with a guy ... so today, my friend (who just happens to be gay) was in the store and we chatted for a few minutes.  As soon as he left, they were like "Who was that!  Is that a prospect?  Would you date him?  He was handsome.  Who was the hotty?" etc.  It was really hard not to giggle as I said that there was no chance of dating him :)  Damn girls at work.  Frankly, I don't want to be "hooked up".  I am enjoying this whole being single thing too much!  Well, I'm off to grab a quick bite and then go to a meeting.  Happy Tuesday!

      Well, it's been ages since I've posted ... had a busy weekend, my SIL was here for a quick visit!  Of course, I had to get up in the wee hours to pick her up, but it was worth it!  Been spending lots of time with Necy & the kidlets lately.  Otherwise, nothing new to say!  Have a good week.

      Okay, I officially have insomnia.  It's almost 2:30 am and I can't sleep ... I am tired, but sleep just isn't coming to me.  Insomnia really sucks.  Well, that's all I wanted to share.  I am going to go and lie in bed and read until I can't keep my eyes open anymore.  Night  (or should I say morning????) .

      I just stubbed my baby toe on my left foot and damn it smarts!!!!  I just thought I would share that with everyone.  It has been a quiet few days.  Went into the store for a few hours tonight.  We just reno-ed the gift section and I am doing some extra hours to re-display everything.  I am really happy that we have finally done some renovations, as we have been begging since my store moved 2 1/2 years ago.  Well, I am off to bed ... I am going to work on picking my colours and changing my blog look this week when I can.  Night all!

      YAY!  I finally figured out how to change colours ... so bear with me as they may change quite a bit over the next little while until I figure out the combination I like best.

      Today, I had a day off from work!  So, today I: -picked up neice & nephew, took to hardware store to get new door handle for my sister -went to see my doctor to get results from a specialist visit  (still with kidlets) -dropped off kidlets, raced out to Castlegar -did a tv interview -installed my sister's doorknob  (which involved removing said door from hinges)  -went to gyro park for a picnic dinner/spray park fun It was a really busy day!  Yesterday I did a radio interview ... it went really well, except the announcer picked on me :(  Went out with the kidlets & my sis, since it was too hot to stay home.  When we got back to her house, the damn door wouldn't open.  Doorknob turned, nothing happened!  Thought maybe I could fix it, so I took off the doorknob.  The part that goes from the door into the door frame was stuck ... but stuck closed and the only way you can remove that part from the door is from the side that sits against the doorframe, not the hole that the knob goes through.  So, today I went to my sisters to remove said doorknob again.  I had to take it to the hardware store to be sure I got a new one that would fit  (being that it was an ancient doorknob) .  Then, to install this damn knob, I had to take the door right off the hinges.  Damn thing put up a pretty good fight too, until I got pissed off, kicked it really hard  (while saying a really nice word)  and it went flying!  Needless to say got the door off, the doorknob installed and the door back on.  Did I mention that my sister had a showing  (their house is for sale)  at 4 and this all had to be done before that?  Yeah, it was pretty crazy :)  Had a really strange run-in today with a girl I went to highschool with and haven't seen for at least 10 years ... I'm driving to my interview  (speeding cause I'm running late)  and I stop at a light  (cursing,  cause I'm running late) .  This person shouts my name and I look over, thinking to myself  'who the hell is yelling at me' .  I don't recognize her, I have no freaking clue who it is ... She's like,  "It's me, so-&-so ... my husband & I are living here now ... I saw you on tv the other day ... What's your phone #? "  Just one more reason why I shouldn't be on TV!  Actually, it was really strange.  We'll see if she calls.  Oh my goodness, I have a lot to say ... guess I'm making up for all my  "it's hot and I'm bitchy posts"  this last week!  Had to pop into work today, and there was the "smile guy" again.  It was cute, cause he turned around and when he saw me he blushed.  He asked me where something was and I said to him, "I can't tell you ... I'm not working" :) ME BAD!  Then I told him.  He says thanks, and blushes even redder.  Made me feel kind of good.  Noticed he isn't bad looking either and has a really nice smile himself.    And just one last note:  I managed to say BICEP in my tv interview today, rather than BISOP which I managed to say 3 times last time!  Also, mongo zit managed to clear up to a more un-noticable size.  All-in-all, I think I did pretty good.  Well, I'm off to do other things!  Hope it's cooler where you are!  Nighty-night all!

      Holy poopies!  I just got home and I had a very scary incident ... A big M.F. BEAR was in the yard.  Did I mention there was a bear?????  Driving in, I notice that one of the garbage cans is knocked over ... I think, I will pick it up.  I get out of my car, get my stuff, close car door and all of a sudden I hear CRASH CRASH CRASH!  I'm thinking holy crap, the bear must have been here still and has just ran up the hill ... Boy was I wrong!  Said bear was in tree in yard.  It seems that I caught said bear in act of trying to eat the second garbage can (no garbage in either bin though).  EEK!  So, I walk along towards my door (which is quite a distance away I must add) and pick up the 1st garbage can.  This is when I realize that bear was into the other garbage can and that the bear is coming down and out of the tree.  Meanwhile, I keep moving saying "Stay in the tree.  Stay.  Stay in the tree."  My landlady sticks her head out her bedroom window and says "Is he out there?" and "You go inside now".  By this point, I thought I may have soiled myself and I am shaking so bad that I can hardly get my key into the door to unlock it.  So, yeah ... That was my frightening experience of today!  Well, once again it is late and I am beginning to sport these really beautiful bags under my eyes.  So, I am forcing myself to get the hell off of the computer and stop doing things and just go to bed!  Goodnight all ...

      You know, money is a terribly stressing thing.  What if someone was to give you a bunch of money ... What would you spend it on?  Would you just do practical stuff with it (like buy groceries, pay bills, etc.) or would you use it to treat yourself and splurge on things you wouldn't normally buy?  Money is terribly stressing ... There never seems to be enough of it and yet the possibility of having too much is scary.  Yeah, that's my current thoughts.  It's late and I'm one tired chicky.  Night all.

      ... I hate about living by myself, is cooking for just me.  Sometimes I feel hungry but I don't feel like cooking.  I'm having a moment like that right now.  I feel hungry, my tummy is growling, but I really don't feel like cooking or making anything.  So, instead I am writing on here :)  Pretty silly, eh!  Had a flat tire this morning, cause I somehow ran over a screw.  Thought I would just change it myself (it's not difficult) but I couldn't find my jack.  So, I ended having to phone my road-side assistance and have them change it.  I was supposed to be at church for the early service this morning (my week to volunteer as Lay Minister), but I didn't end up making it.  I did manage to make it to the late service though ... Found my jack after all that.  You would think that they would put it in the same place as the spare tire, tire iron, etc. ... But no!  Part of it is there and part of it is in a compartment in my trunk that I didn't even realize I had.  Boy did I feel like a dumb woman when the tow-truck driver pointed that out to me.  Anyways, I suppose I should go and round up some grub ... Or maybe I'll have a nap.  Later!

      Today, I decided that I would like to become a dominatrix when I grow up.  I decided this for several reasons: 1) I would get to wear bitch boots 2) I would get paid to be a bitch 3) I would get paid to be mean to people 4) I'm a sick person That's my thought for the evening.

      Have I ever mentioned that I am unhappy in my job?  Sometimes I am more unhappy than other times ... Today was one of those.  My damn boss makes me want to slug back a stiff drink sometimes.  Today it was " You're not taking enough time to do this ... You should be asking for extra time.  If you don't think you can handle it, I'll get someone else to do it."   I'm sorry, I was just attempting to get through the 50 billion other extra responsibilities that you put onto my plate, but tell you what - I'll drop everything else  (even though you've stressed just how important those things are)  and do it right f-ing now.  Then, not even 4 hours later I get  "You have to dismantle the display that you just spent 4 hours on yesterday, because we've decided to paint in that spot right away instead of using our brains and waiting until the next time that spot is empty."   Yeah, I love how I get a big speech on time management and then they bull this B.S.  What a crock of SH*T!  So, Monday I am going to demand 5 extra hours a week on top of my regularly scheduled hours.  I am tired of getting all this extra stuff dumped on me and not getting any extra time to do it in.  I am seriously considering demanding a raise too.  How dare they say  "If you can't handle it, we'll get someone else to do it" .  What a great way to motivate your employees.  Why not just say,  "We think you are a worthless piece of poop and we will flush you anytime we feel like it."   Add a good dose of PMS on top of that and you have one really happy employee :)  Anyways, it's late and I have to spend my day slaving away at a job that I just love and wasting my time dismantling a display that I can't wait to do.  Hope your Friday/Saturday go much better.  Goodnight.

      Don't you have some laundry to do or something?  Oh, you are so cute when you get all pissed off.  You're just upset because your butt is beginning to spread.  Wait a minute - I get it. What time of the month is it?  You sure you don't want to consult the great Oprah on this one?  Sorry. I was just picturing you naked.  Whoa, time out. Football is on.  Looks like someone had an extra bowl of bitch flakes this morning!  Is there any way we can do this via e-mail?  Who are you kidding? We both know that thing ain't loaded.

      I woke up to the strangest dream this morning ... I dreamt that I was swimming in the ocean and there were fish all around me and then I saw this really strange fish, but it wasn't a fish.  It looked like an animal.  So, I swam closer and it was the white rabbitt from Alice in Wonderland and it sent out an airbubble that said "I'm late" in it.  Then I jerked awake!  Looked at the clock and I had shut off my alarm clock and it was later then I should have slept.  So, it was a good thing I woke up when I did ... but what a fucked up dream!

      I was given this poem by an older lady in my store yesterday ... wanted to share.    If I Only Knew  (Author Unknown)   If I only knew that, it would be the last time That I’d see you fall asleep. I would tuck you in more tightly, And pray the Lord your soul to keep.  If I knew it would be the last time That I see you walk out the door, I would give you a hug and a kiss, And call you back for one more.  If I knew it would be the last time I’d hear your voice, I would just listen.. If I knew it would be the last time I could spare an extra minute to say, “I love you” Instead of assuming, you would know I do.  If I knew it would be the last time I would be there to share your day -  Well, I’m so sure you’ll have so many more So, I can let just this one slip away.  For surely there’s always tomorrow, To make up for an oversight. And we always get a second chance, To make everything just right. There will always be another day to say, “I love you”. And certainly there’s another chance To say, “Anything I can do?”  But just in case, I may be wrong And today is all I get -  I’d like to say how much I love you, And I hope we never forget.  Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, Not young or old, And today may be the last chance You have your loved one to hold.  So if you’re waiting for tomorrow Why not do it today? For if tomorrow never comes, You’ll surely regret the day.  That you didn’t take that extra time For a smile, a hug, or a kiss. It can wait until tomorrow, But it can’t.  So, hold your loved one close today And whisper in their ear, And tell them how much you love them, And that you’ll always hold them dear.  Take time to say, “I’m sorry”, “Please forgive me”, “Thank you”, or “It’s okay” and if tomorrow never comes, You’ll have no regrets about today.

      Okay, you know what I really hate?  I hate fast food workers who aren't fast!  I went to McD's for supper tonight, being that they owed me a free meal and I didn't feel like cooking ... well, they only had one person working on the till and she was slower than a freaking snail.  To top it off, they screwed up my order and I didn't realize until I got home.  So, I phone to bitch them out ... what do I get???  Another free meal.  Oh how exciting.  Those bastards!

      Okay, I've officially graduated from being a bad blogger to being a terrible blogger!  There just aren't enough hours in the day to keep up.  My last few weeks have been awfully full ones between work, youth work, volunteer work, etc.  Had a run in with a g/f about keeping her yap shut, didn't get the job that I really wanted, came to the conclusion that I hate my job.  Life is good!      Well, I'm writing between things on my to do list.  I have to run now and pick up a camera and go and do some photos (good thing with digital cameras: doesn't matter if you cut heads off, cause you can see and take a new one right away!), etc.  Hope you are having a good Manic Monday!

      Wowzers today has been a long day!  I was up late working on youthy stuff, worked all day and then had two meetings (starting right after work and one after another).  Got home and had to run out to be ear/shoulder for an upset girlfriend.  Needless to say, I am bloody exhausted!  So, I am off to bed with not much to say ... BTW it was a most beautiful autumn day today with the temperature just right!  Goodnight.

      Well, it must be Autumn because I had a major craving for potato soup ... So guess what I made tonight????  POTATO SOUP!  With croutons and such  (YUMMY!) .  Autumn is my favourite season:  It isn't hot like summer, it isn't snowy like winter, it isn't rainy like spring ...  It's just right.  The leaves all turn this fantastic array of autumn colours like red, orange and yellow.  Of course, you can't forget Thanksgiving  (turkey)  and Halloween  (costumes & candy)  !  Pumpkins, baking, stews and soups, hot chocolate, fireplaces, wool socks ... Autumn is the best season ever!  That, folks, is my  "Ode to Autumn" !

      I decided today that I am terrible at blogging lately ... I hang my head in shame :)  It is so difficult to find time to blog when life gets busy.  Took my car for L.O. & F. #2 today ... I can't believe how quickly km's add up!  I know that I am right on target, but it seems like I came to 16,000 rather quickly.  Spent the weekend away with my youth kidlets this weekend.  We did a Myers-Briggs workshop ... Reaction to my being an introvert was kind of funny.  Yes, I may seem like I am outgoing, but my thoughts and stuff are mine!  I ordered pizza tonight,  for the first time in months and months ... mmmmm!  I was feeling much too lazy to cook and now I can eat leftovers for days.  Well, that's all I've got tonight.  I'm still over tired from the weekend and I am heading to bed now.  It's going to be another busy week this week, so not sure when I'll blog again.  Have an enjoyable week and goodnight.

      Day 5 and still counting!  Actually, today wasn't too terribly bad, unless you consider harbouring thoughts of stabbing a coworker in eye with pen and kicking coworker in head with foot, etc. as bad!  Took nephew to see the Lillix concert tonight.  The concert was fairly decent, although Lillix didn't perform much of their 'more popular' music until the end of their set.  The opening band was fairly good too, can't remember their damn name though!  Saw a certain someone who put a smile on my face tonight!  Anyways, it's late and I have to drive a bit tomorrow, so I should get my ass into bed.  Have a good weekend all, I will be away until Sunday.  Goodnight!

      Okay, it's day 4 and I'm definitely feeling bitchy.  Was told at work today that I seemed a little edgy ... no kidding!  I've been treating myself everyday for not smoking.  Today's treat was a slurpee from 7/11.  Walked again tonight ... That at least was good.  Tomorrow I am taking my nephew to see the Lillix concert!  Anyways, I am going to bed.  Goodnight.

      So, I killed a mouse tonight.  I'm feeling slightly emotional about the whole thing ... I set the mouse trap for my sister (2nd time, 1st time I used P.B. and it just ate it and ran).  I set 2 traps, with cheese.  My nephew had just gone up the stairs to bed, my sis and I were sitting on the couch chatting.  Not even 5 minutes later we hear "SNAP!".  Mouse trap goes off.  I go into kitchen 1st ... Well, do you think that damn mouse would just die instantly like any other mouse?  NO!  It gets nicked in the head and stuns itself.  Damn thing was going around in circles, bleeding all over the place.  So, I scooped it up with the broom & dustpan.  It still wasn't dead.  So, sis put it into a plastic bag and disposed of it.  I'm traumatized.  Otherwise, today was a pretty good day!  It's still back-to-school at work.  My shift today went ripping past, it was so busy!  Got off work and when I got to my car, I thought I had died & gone to heaven ... There was the entire Smokies (hockey) team, running with no shirts, glistening with sweat, muscles rippling :)  Went for a nice walk with one of my g/f's tonight then watched the kidlets so my sis could get some groceries.  What an exciting life, eh!  Well, it's time to go to bed.  Goodnight.

      As an Anglican, I have been trying to keep as up-to-date as possible on the continuing debate of homosexuality in the church.  Today, I came across a forum called "Discerning Episcopalian".  So, I began reading what people had to say (both sides are represented).  Some ignoramus posted a comment called "Consecrating Sodomy" and went on to quote an article/provide link for an article about the negative health effects of homosexuality.  Anyways, the reason I think he is ignorant is that he is basing the opinion on an article that is old (no resources/facts dated any newer than 1999) and not even written by a professional.  It's written by some fanatic who has compiled a bunch of different facts to make homosexuals look bad.  I wonder if he has done any comparisons of homosexual relationships vs. Heterosexual relationships????  The article talks about how homosexuals cheat,  have lots of STD's and aids and practice unsafe sex ... gee, so do straight people.  Also, the article refers to lesbians who sleep with men ... does that not make then bisexual???  How can someone trust an article that can't even get their terminology correct???  Anyways ... I just wanted to share, cause that really chapped my ass today.

      I really love the smell of fresh laundry … if fact, there is nothing better than putting on my sweatshirt when it is fresh from the dryer.  It is warm and it smells very nice.  That is my thought currently!  It’s Sunday afternoon and I am being lazy … did some laundry at the Laundromat today then came home and vegged on the couch, watching “The Royal Tenenbaums”.  It is a very weird movie: kind of sad and funny at the same time.  If you haven’t seen it, I recommend it.  Anyways, I think I will go and make some homemade soup.  It is chilly and very fall like today, so I think some cold weather comfort food is in order.  Hope you had a good weekend!

      Well, another crazy week has gone by.  You know, I think that as you get older time speeds up.  I can't believe that it is already the end of October.  This last year has been crazy ... with so many changes in my life.  Soon, it will be December and then Spring and then Summer and I will be beginning a new chapter in my life yet again.  I think I want to be a kid again, when things are a bit slower and you have more time to savour things.  That's my thoughts currently.  Anyways, I have to go and drive to a meeting in Cranbrook.  Have a good weekend.

      I just wanted to share today, that my thoughts and prayers are with the flood victims on the lower mainland and elsewhere.

      Well, it's official ... I have laryngitis.  So, if you are wondering why I haven't "talked" to you in the last week, that would be why!  The girls at work are enjoying how quiet it was at work this last week.  I, of course, warned them not to get used to it, as I would make up for lost time once I got my voice back!  I haven't been blogging much lately, but that is because life has been somewhat hectic!  I have 2 super busy times during the year: October and May.  This October happened to be a little extra busy with the addition of volunteering for a local Cancer Society fundraiser.  The event was a super success!  We sold out tickets in less than 3 weeks and raised over $27,000 for the Canadian Cancer Society to use for breast cancer research and awareness.  This was my first attempt at doing public relations and I liked it, other than the whole TV thing.  It has been a great learning experience for me too!    I spent Thanksgiving weekend in Quesnel as an adult chaperone for a youth conference.  It was a great weekend, with an amazing group of youth!  I feel re-affirmed in my calling to work with teenagers.  Maybe I'll eventually figure what exactly in that field I want to do :)  I've been helping my sister lots lately, since she has sold their house (WTG Necy!) and is in the process of packing everything up.  I hate packing!  I am very happy for her, since her family will finally get to be together and at the same time I am sad, since we haven't lived far away from each other for more than a year in our whole lives.  We talk on the phone almost every day and see each other several times a week.  This is going to be a major change for both of us!  I am going to miss my sister a lot ... and my niece and nephews too.  Oh well, I will just have to go to the city to go shopping lots ;)  Anyways, I must get the heck off the computer and attempt at cleaning my house.  Since I haven't had any spare time in the last few weeks, my house is an absolute disaster zone.  I think I haven't done much more than sleep, shower and sometimes eat here for a long time.  You can imagine that I've let things pile up just a little!  Anyways, hope all is well in reader land.  I will try and write again soon :) Happy weekend!

      This last week has just ripped past!  The event that I have been volunteering for happened this last weekend.  I'm getting used to the bears (oh yeah, there's 2 not just 1) and I have come to the conclusion that they won't eat me ... Cut my hair off, got my eyebrows waxed.  Bought a pair of boots and some new clothes ... Got told that I look like a dark haired Leanne Rimes (I so don't get this one).  Was major sleep deprived by Sunday.  That's pretty much been my week.  I am going away this weekend with my kidlets to some god-awful place called Quesnel, which involves a mega long bus ride.  So, if I don't write again this week, have a happy Thanksgiving!

      I was hunting for my college transcripts today; since I require them now … I thought they were stored in one of my memory boxes.  So, I climbed and reached boxes out of my storage cupboard.  Well, I never found my transcripts – instead I took a stroll down memory lane.  I found old pictures, old poems, old diaries, and old notes.  Some made me happy, some made me sad, and some made me laugh aloud!  You know, I have gone through some pretty crappy things in life – but reflecting on it right now, if none of the bad stuff happened, I would never be who I am today and never have experienced the things I have been lucky to experience so far.  So, I am feeling slightly nostalgic right now … remembering days of the stairway gang, java, spuds, karaoke, snowball wars while driving, Rusty, Darkwing Duck, melted cheese, the ratty yellow couch, togas, lobsters with pink tutus and much more (sorry, all “you had to be there” things).  I guess it’s fitting, since a chapter of my life will close shortly and I will move on to a new chapter.  Well, enough of this.  It’s time to go to bed.  Night all … and have a wonderful weekend!

      So, I got off work today and trudged over to the parking lot to my car.  It's snowing like a SOB ... Have I mentioned that?  So, I get in my car, start it and crank the heat.  I get out to brush off my car ... When I go to get back in, my car is locked.  I locked my keys in the car, with the car running.  I have never done anything as stupid in my whole life.  So, I run over to a nearby store that just happens to be open still ... I try phoning the car dealership (because of course, my purse with my roadside card is in the car) ... Even though they are supposed to be open until 6, they were closed.  So, I tried phoning everyone I could possibly think of so that I could go him and get a spare car key, but no one was home or able to take me.  Luckily, the really nice girl in the store gave me a lift home and back to my car.  Sounds like a happy ending, right?  NO, it wasn't.  I couldn't locate my spare car key, which is normally hanging by the door ... I tore my house apart as quickly as I could considering this nice girl was waiting for me ... NO key.  So, I grabbed my extra roadside key instead and got a ride back down to my car.  At this point, my car had been running for over 1/2 an hour ... I then trudged to the nearest payphone and called my roadside plan to come and pop my locks.  My car ended running for almost an hour.  It's a damn good thing that I had lots of gas!  So, yeah ... That's my crappy day.  Now I'm going to go and sulk in a hot bath, cause I lack feeling in my toes.  Hope your damn day was much better than mine!

      You know, this  urlLink picture  reminds me of my short career as a McD's employee ... You would always get that one really big person  (Note: not that I have anything against big people, I am not perfectly skinny myself)  who would come in and order a Double Quarter Pounder meal supersized and then a diet coke ... CAUSE IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUDDY!

      Well, I realized today that I am often requesting prayers for someone or other ... so I have created a new  urlLink blog  for specifically that purpose.  So, if that is something that you are interested in or you wish to read you may ... but if it is something that does not interest you, you do not have to read it.  Made a few other small changes too.  Okay, now I'm off and running :)

      Yesterday was a long one ... I spent most of the day saying "Would you like a hot chocolate or coffee?" It reminded me to much of my days at McD's saying "Would you like that supersized?" ... LOL.  You know, it really amazes me how open kids are here about pot.  Earlier this week, there were a bunch of punks smoking it in the alley behind where I work.  So, I said to them that it was kind of obvious (they were in a corner) and they laughed about that.  Then, last night I was walking to my car after work and this group of kids calls out to another kid who's across the street "Hey come back, we want to buy some stuff ..."  Now, I'm not saying that I've never smoked it myself ... It's just that when I was that age we were never so open about it.  Well, I received a distressing phone call last night.  The father of one of my g/f's has a terminal (sp?) illness.  She phoned to say that he was admitted to the hospital and most likely won't make it out this time.  My heart is breaking for her ... So, say a little prayer for her if you will.  Well, that's all of the tidbits I feel like writing about right now.  I'm off to run errands and to do some laundry at the Laundromat.  Have a happy weekend!

      Well,  I'm feeling rather dissappointed tonight ... had to cancel my kidlet's event this weekend because of low numbers.  Luckily, only had to deal with one truly unhappy parent.  Oh well, one of the perks I guess.  Tomorrow I get to play hostess at work ... we are having a customer appreciation day and I am being payed to give people coffee and socialize :) My kind of day!  Anyways, I am going to go to bed early since I've been burning the candle at both ends and I am feeling tired and bummed ... night all.

      This week has been crazy and it's only half over!  Work has been nuts ... I have a youth event this weekend ... crazy!  But, through it all, I have stuck to my 'diet' and eaten properly.  I actually ate all my recommended servings for fruit & veggies 3 days in a row now!  Also, I discovered that the Vanilla O So Good soy milk I bought it palatable on cereal :)  Anyways, I must get off the computer and back on to the phone.  Happy Hump Day :)

      I was very good.  I ate super healthy and last night I even drank 1/2 a glass of soy milk.  Of course, I had to stop at half cause I thought I was gonna gag, but it's all mind over matter :)  Anyways, it's time for Regular Joe, so I must get off the computer!  Happy Monday.     PS ... Squiggles, how did you do on your presentation??????

      Went to church this morning ... Went grocery shopping.  I actually spent a decent amount of money on groceries today!  In fact, I spent more on groceries today than I have in over 6 months ... I have decided to try and eat     healthier.  I don't want to pack on the winter weight, so I am going to do water aerobics and eat a little better.  I spent most of the afternoon cleaning (YUCK!).  I even cleaned out my freezer of all the crap I will no longer eat, since I've changed my diet (i.e. the meat).  I am getting closer and closer to being vegetarian.  At this point, I may have chicken once and a while,  but that is all for meat.  No pork and I haven't eaten beef in more years than I can remember.  I am even going to try and get into the habit of drinking fortified soy milk, to add some more calcium to my diet ... But we'll see if that one works.  Anyways, its about time for me to get back to cleaning ... I gave myself a short break.  Hope everyone has a great week :)

      Today was a super duper long day ... Worked from 10 to about 8:30.  Plus, I was up very late last night on the phone (cough ... not mentioning any names)  and painting.  I would like to say that my cathedral church turned out beautifully and my window display looks pretty damn good too!  Anyways, I'm just popping in really quickly to read email, blogs, etc ... Now I must go to bed.  Goodnight all.   PS ... Happy Birthday to the Ma!

      Okay, so I was reading The Oliver Chronicle online.  I read it on a regular basis.  Today, I come across this  urlLink article  about some vandalism that occurred on a historical trail.  Well, some asshole in the article puts all of the blame onto the youth.  They even go so far as saying that they phoned the local highschool to tell them that they should be talking to the students about vandalism.  Boy, that really gets my blood boiling when people are so quick to blame the youth.  Yes, youth do bad things too, but so do adults.  You know, young people have this horrible stigma of being trouble makers, etc. and it is bred by ignorant people such as the one from this article.  So, being the person I am, I decided to write to the editor about it.  This is what I wrote: I am not normally one to write to the Editor, but I was appalled by parts of an article I read.  In "Fairview townsite trails fall victim to vandalism" (November 12, 2003), a Fairview Townsite committee member was quick to blame the youth of Oliver for the vandalism.  I would just like to point out that it is not just youth who are dirt bike users and adults do commit acts of vandalism as well.  There are so many great kids in your community and it is assumptions such as this one that give all of them a bad reputation.  I am outraged that a committee representative would make such an assumption.  I am appalled that the school was phoned so that they could "talk to the youth about vandalism".  Who is talking to the adults?  Another committee member mentions that he wonders if "...they (youth), or their parents for that matter, are aware of the importance of this site.?   I don't necessarily think this is a problem of youth gone wild, but more so a problem of education for everyone.  Maybe people just aren't aware of the history and importance of the Fairview Townsite.  Maybe it is time to start educating, rather than pointing fingers.  Anyways, that's my current rant for the day.  I'm off to run some errands now.  Later!

If you haven't seen it, I recommend it ... but make sure you have a big box of tissues handy.  It is a beautiful story.  Okay, that's all I have to write.  It's late and I think I will head to bed!  Goodnight  (morning)  everyone.

      I spent 5 billion hours driving today.  Okay, maybe not that long, but it feels like it!  I drove about 4 hours, had a meeting that lasted about 3 hours and then drove home again (aka 4 hours).  Isn't that thrilling??  I'm so devoted to my youth kidlets.  Needless to say, I'm feeling a little tired ... But I'm not as tired as the time that I drove home from White Rock on very little sleep.  I left in rush hour, it took me well over 2 hours to get to Hope, the roads were super crappy and I was driving all by myself ... It took me forever and a day to get home (something like 11 hours).  By the time I hit Osoyoos I was sooooo tired that I chain smoked and drank Jolt the rest of the way home to keep myself going.  That night, when I finally got home, I collapsed into bed and fell into a restless sleep ... Everytime I would finally fall asleep, I would jerk awake thinking that I had fallen asleep driving.  That, of course, was in my younger "more foolish" days.  Now, in my infinite wisdom, I realize that is totally asinine and I'm lucky I didn't die or horribly maim some poor stranger.  Yeah, I'm a little tired ... I think I'm rambling and not making much sense, so I'm going to go and lie on my couch and fall asleep watching some random movie that I'll have to watch again tomorrow because I'll be lucky if I make it past the previews AND if by chance I do make it past the previews, I probably will have absolutely no idea what the movie is about anyways.  Okay ... goodnight!

      I had a very weird day ... One of my co-workers (who I don't particularly like) gave me a big hug ... Some old man hit on me ... And I freaking hate Christmas!  I am trying to condense (aka cram shit) so that I can make room for Christmas stock and I STILL haven't come up with a bright idea for my Christmas window which I have to do in 1 week.  On a lighter note, I've decided to write a book "How to drive like a local" which will cover the finer points of: 1) Not ever using your signal light 2) Leaving your high-beams on ALL the time 3) Not looking before turning right on a red light 4) Slamming on your brakes when you are in the middle of an intersection and the light turns red 5) Parking in a no-parking zone so that no one can see around your big boat of a vehicle and crash because of it And that is just stuff I witnessed today:)  Anyways, I'm off to weed-whack ... I mean shave my legs (I'm sure you always wanted to know that).  Hope your Thursday was good.   AND  BY THE WAY ... SHAME ON ALL YOU BLOGGERS THAT I REGULARLY READ WHO NEVER BLOG ANYMORE.  YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

      to everyone who gave get well wishes :)  I am feeling much better today, although still a little tired.  YES, I ate enough/drank enough/kept warm enough/etc.  Thanks for being motherly, Necy!  Went to work today and even put on 4 winter tires (4 being a big deal, cause I've only ever put on 2).  Realized today that I am on week 2 of veggie eating.  Tomorrow I am thinking about making a stuffed pasta dish with tofu ... we'll see how energetic I am feeling after work.  Still having dilemnas over Christmas display window.  I'm hoping that some inspiration will visit me soon.  Talked to my sis on the phone today and my youngest nephew ... boy was that good.  I was having some major withdrawal symptoms.  It is weird not getting to talk everyday.  I think I will have to settle into to once a week or so:)  Anyways, I am going to go and have some mint tea or hot chocolate (aka going for a coffee, but I don't drink coffee).  Happy "HUMP DAY" all!

      Well, I woke up at about 4am this morning sick.  After tossing and turning for about 4 hours, being too hot and then too cold my body decided vomiting would be even more fun.  Boy, I love being sick.  Should have known it was coming, as I was feeling very out-of-sorts and tired yesterday.  So, I spent most of today in bed sleeping.  I'm not very good at being sick.  I'm bored and feeling slightly stir-crazy from being in my apartment all day.  But, I am feeling extremely un-energetic.  So, in I will be staying.  Managed to keep food down this afternoon though, so I shall go to bed early and then go to work tomorrow.  Stupid FLU!

      A new TV show aired tonight on the one channel that I get … it’s called “Average Joe”.  In short, shallow bimbo girl goes on reality show to hook up with a prince charming.  She’s expecting 6-pack hunks and gets 16 “Average Joes”.  There is love handles, beer bellies, buckteeth, shortness, tallness, etc.  The whole concept is somewhat amusing … I think this is a show I would like to follow to the end.  Will this ‘Shallow Hal’ end up finding love?????  Anyways, not much going on … my sister moved this weekend and I am in a bit of a funk missing her and the kidlets.  I am happy for them, don’t get me wrong, but I miss them all dearly.  I am going into some major withdrawals, since I am used to talking to her on the phone everyday.  Unfortunately, my phone bill can’t afford that :)  Had another run-in with an ex-g/f last night.  She kept getting in my face … I really wanted to bash her with a rock, but instead I behaved myself.  It took some major self-control and tongue biting to do so though.  I was at a g/f’s birthday do, so I figured it would be rude to start something.  Anyways, I’m off to bed … we’re starting the Christmas season at work and things will get rather hectic.  Right now, my brain is swirling with what my Christmas window display will be.  Night and hope everyone is having a good week … and Necy if you’re reading this, miss you and I hope that you are settling in :)

      Well, holidays are over and its time to go back to the grind!  I had a wonderful Christmas ... Went to my sister's in Calgary.  My brother came as well, with his fiance ... That's right!  They got engaged on Boxing Day!!!!!  (Congrats you two!)  Saw the LOTR for a second time.  Went to a big-ass mall on boxing day (never again).  Got to spend time with my sissy and the kidlets (YAY!).  Got to visit with friends (thanks for brunch Kimberly and Darryl ... Glad we got to visit Amita!).  Got to see a bit of Calgary.  Bought a kick butt pair of jeans super cheap.  Unfortunately, I have been sick with a whopping head cold since the 24th .... Otherwise I had a wonderful Christmas and holiday.  Well, I must go and start getting ready for work (blegh!)!

      So, I took a test today and here's the results:     urlLink Take the Affliction Test Today!  Transmitted by rabid animals, you're most commonly found infecting creatures such as raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes. But don't worry, you affect humans too, causing either paralysis or hyperactivity in your advanced stages, and ultimately death.  Your most famous symptom is hypersalviation - that delightful foaming at the mouth that we have come to know and indeed love. However, you can also cause hallucination; think of the fun you could have at parties!  I just thought I would share ....

      OMG ... LOTR Return of the King ruled!!!!  It was by far the best of the three movies!  Only tips I will give are: If you're scared of spiders, bring a blindfold, and if you cry at movies, bring kleenex.  I am extremely tired, as I got under 4 hours of sleep last night ... BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!  I recommend seeing this movie!

      Have I mentioned that I am completely sick of Christmas music?  The morons at work can't seem to comprehend that shuffle does not work on the stereo system.  Instead of shuffling between the 3 discs, it plays the same 4 or 5 songs OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  It's enough to make me want to dip into the eggnog at 9:00 in the morning!  My boss and I keep arguing about it ... her take is that I just  think  I'm hearing the same song over and over because there are only  so many  Christmas songs out there and I  am  indeed hearing the same song, just a different version.  PLEASE!  I think I am capable of discerning the difference between the exact same song or a different version .... Makes me want to smash the stereo.  But, of course, I won't.  I'll just seeth inwardly while plotting evil deeds :>  On that note, I'm off to work to listen to some lovely Christmas music.  Hope you have a good day!  PS ... I added a new link  urlLink "Bob from Accounting".   It is really freakin' hilarious!  I want some of his t-shirts.

      Today’s driving lesson is all about the signal light … what’s that you ask?  It’s that little knobby thing by your steering wheel and guess what - it actually does something!  If you pull it up or push it down, it makes a little light flash on your car, letting other driver’s know which way you intend to turn.  Wow!  Isn’t that the most amazing thing you’ve ever heard?  Now, you may be thinking to yourself,  “Why do I need to use my signal light?  I know which way I’m going …”  That is exactly the problem!   YOU  may know which way you are going, but unfortunately, most people  AREN’T  mind readers and have no freaking clue what you are thinking.  For example, you may be thinking about turning right at the intersection, but if you don’t signal the driver across from you most likely has no clue.  The outcome of this tragic mistake could be an accident.  Of course, you could keep this accident from happening by simply pulling up or pushing down on that lovely little knobby thing beside your steering wheel.  Let’s recap: 1) Use your G.D. signal light! 2) Other driver’s ARE NOT mind readers. 3) Use your signal light ALL the time, even when there are no other cars on the road because otherwise you will become lazy and won’t use it. 4) Not using your signal light can cause accidents and you will be to blame. 5)  Use your G.D. signal light!   Next lesson: “Courtesy on the Road”

      So, I got the notice in the mail today that I soon will have to renew my driver's license ... I almost had a heart attack when I saw how much.  It is going to cost me OVER $100 to renew my bloody license, PLUS I have to get a medical exam because I have a higher class then most people.  So, I have to pay close to a hundred to renew my license and then a fee so that they can process my medical exam.  Talk about highway robbery ... Those bastards!  In total, I will probably end up paying closer to $200 then $100.  I LOVE THE GOVERNMENT, DON'T YOU?

      So, I forgot my book at work ... which is torture, cause I'm at a good part ... and because I read every night before I go to bed.  So, last night I had to go to bed without reading and I had a terrible time falling asleep.  Well, I'm off to work today to re-do my window display and finish off a whack of gift baskets I am doing (and get my damn book).  Have a happy Saturday :)

      You know, I don’t understand some people … I found out at work today that we aren’t getting Christmas bonuses this year.  Sales are down and it’s just not feasible.  I won’t lie and say that I’m not disappointed, because I am.  What I don’t understand is some people’s attitudes about this.  It is a BONUS.  They don’t have to give it to us.  As much as I may gripe about my job, I am very lucky that I have a good employer who treats me pretty well.  I am very lucky that I have been given opportunity to learn new things and gain new skills.  There aren’t many jobs where I live, and I am lucky to have a good one.  So, when some of my coworkers start grumbling about how we’re not getting a Christmas bonus and how crappy that is and there are no perks anymore, I want to scream!  Economics are tight everywhere and everyone has had to buckle down.  My job puts food on my table and a roof over my head and for that I am grateful.  They talk about having to spend a little wiser this Christmas … so why is it so bad when the boss said the same thing?   PEOPLE!

      All right, this one is for all you melon heads out there ...  Everyone has them in their car, the High Beam.  Contrary to popular belief, not everyone is aware of the finer points of using their high beams.  So, here are some pointers to help you:  1) Do not use your high beams all-the-time.   Your fellow road warriors prefer to keep their retinas intact. 2) Do not wait to turn down your high beams  until you are so close to the oncoming traffic that you can make out every zit that the oncoming driver has.  If you are close enough to see their vehicle clearly, you are most likely close enough to turn down your high beams. 3) Again, do not wait to turn down your high beams  until you can see every nick on the back bumper of the vehicle ahead of you.  All you are doing is casting a wicked shadow in front of that driver's vehicle and blinding them to boot. 4) DON'T STARE INTO THE HEADLIGHTS!   You are not a deer - you are capable of blinking.  If you value your retinas, look down and to the right at the little white line until the oncoming vehicle has passed. 5)You know the old saying,  "Two wrongs don't make a right"  â€¦ Well, the same applies to using your high beams.  If some moron forgets to turn their high beams off and is burning your eyeballs from your sockets, you need to A) see #4 and B) not high beam them back.  You are then stooping to their moronic level and may even cause a serious accident. 6) I am sick of morons flicking their high beams at me , because they think that I am high beaming them.  It just so happens that I have a new vehicle and my low beams actually work  (not like in my last crappy vehicle where they aimed in two very different directions)   ! So, no moron, I am not high beaming you - these are my low beams and luckily, I'm not stupid enough to flash my high beams at you, as it's dangerous and may cause an accident.  Maybe you should refer to #5! 7)Finally, one last tip to help you on your way -   follow the simple clues as to when a vehicle is approaching you, so you do not blind them .  Sometimes you will see a reflection on the power lines.  Sometimes you will see the vehicle approaching from around a corner.  Pay attention!  Well, I hope these tips have cleared up some of the finer points of High Beam usage.  If you are complete moron and still don't understand how to use them, maybe you should sign up for driving lessons OR BETTER YET cut up your drivers license and use public transportation for the remainder of your life.   SAFE DRIVING EVERYONE!     (Next episode will feature YOUR BRAKES: It is safe to take your foot off the brake!)

      I just finished reading a really cool book ... It was lent to me by K.C. (thanks K!).  It is called Seven Daughters and Seven Sons by Barbara Cohen and Bahija Lovejoy.  A story based on a folktale from Iraq.  It is young adult fiction (which is what K collects) but still a worthwhile read!  So, if you haven't read a good book lately, this one is a good one.  It is short (only 220 pages) and should only take you an hour or so to read.  I just wanted to share!  On another note, thank you to everyone for comments on my Driving for Morons series ... I'm thinking about publishing a 3rd blog dedicated solely to these lessons -  let me know what you think, kay!  I am hunting for a new blogskin for my prayer blog ... Found a really nice one and then realized that the author was pirating images, so I'm back to square one.  Wish I was smart enough to write my own (I'm learning, but it's a slllloooowww process) and with blogger, I can't have images cause no where to host.  I think I may have to break down and get my own domain.  Well, I'm off to gather up laundry (laundry day tomorrow, oh fun) and then go to bed.  Hope you are having a good weekend.  (BTW ... Nice to hear from you Sam I Am!  I shall reply soon, promise!)  Night!

       TODAY'S LESSON IS   TRAFFIC LIGHTS:  NOT JUST DECORATIONS    You all know those boxes that hang on a pole at intersections?  You know, the ones with the three different coloured lights in them?  Well, BELIEVE IT OR NOT ... These are not just some Christmas decorations that the city forgot to take down!  These are something called  TRAFFIC LIGHTS .  Traffic lights serve almost the same purpose as  STOP SIGNS   (if you don't know what that is, I suggest you read my post from Jan. 15/04) .  The traffic light consists of three coloured circles and each one has a different meaning.  Let's start with what each colour means:   GREEN means GO!   Green means that you can go, you have the right-of-way, it is your turn to enter/go through the intersection.   RED means STOP!   Red means that you have to STOP, it is  NOT  your turn to enter/go through the intersection, you  DO NOT  have the right-of-way.   YELLOW OR AMBER means THE LIGHT IS GOING TO TURN RED!   Now we all know what  RED  means ... So when the light is  YELLOW , that means that it is about to be  RED  which means you have to  STOP .  I don't want to confuse you, but there are  some  exceptions to this rule.  Like when the road is really wet or icy and stopping means that you would lose control.  Otherwise, you have no excuse for not stopping.   Contrary to popular belief, yellow does not mean stomp on the gas!   Earlier, I said that traffic lights were  like  stop signs.  There is one difference.  At a stop sign, you come to a stop and then you can go again.   At a traffic light, when the light is  RED  that means you cannot  GO  until the light turns  GREEN  again.    Let's recap:  RED means STOP, GREEN means GO, and YELLOW means the light is going to turn RED which we all know means STOP!    At this point, if you still have no clue what a traffic light is or what you are supposed to do when you see one, you should:  A) Take your driver's license from your wallet and set it on fire!   OR  B) Never ever attempt to get your driver's license because you are obviously too stupid to possess one!   AND  C) Stick to public transit for the remainder of your days!    DRIVE SAFELY EVERYONE!    Next lesson:  You are too old to drive when ...

      I had the bestest nap today ... I had the early shift again today, so when I got home I had a nice nap on the couch.  I suppose I should have done something like gone for a walk, cleaned my computer room, etc.!  It was nice to nap though, and naps are good for you, right?!?  I had a most wonderful homemade tofu burger for supper tonight.  I am struggling with the whole veggie thing .... not cause I miss the meat, because I really don't and I think it would prolly make me sick to eat now.  Mostly cause it's a struggle to find stuff to eat without going broke and not eat the same thing every day.  One thing I hate about living in a small town, is lack of veggie stuff at the grocery store and its expensive and it never goes on sale.  HMMPPH!  I found soy yogurt in Golden and I've never seen it here.  It was yummy too.  That is something I would enjoying taking in my lunch.  Oh well, I'll just have to keep hunting new recipes and trying new things!  Guess I should think about going to bed ... happy hump day!

      I just love heavy snowfall warnings ... I can't believe that 5 to 10 cms is considered heavy snow!  Maybe in Vancouver, where they don't know how do winter drive, but here that's really not that big of a deal.  Really, we're only talking about a few inches!  At least I'm not freezing my buttocks off like those in Calgary  (ha! ha! Sissy)   This new stupid worm out today is really annoying ... I've already gotten it sent to me 3 times, from 3 different sources.  All I can say is thank goodness for anti-virus software.  I'm feeling kind of lost this afternoon, I had the early shift today and was off by 3.  I suppose I should do some house work, but I think that I may veg on the couch with a book instead.  Can you believe that it is already the end of January?????  Where is time going?  Oh well, I'm off to veg!  Enjoy the rest of your Tuesday.   PS ... Please keep my friend D. in your thoughts and prayers.  Her son B. is going for a surgery in Vancouver and they could use as much prayer as possible.  Thanks.

      Spent the weekend with some of my kidlets (THANKS S. & S.) doing some planning for an upcoming event ... driving home today, this song came on the radio.  I think it's called "Crush" but I amn't sure ... anyways, one of my kidlets talked to me about girls.  That convo and the song reminded me of one of my 'childhood' crushes.  I had a super bad crush on E. so I phoned him to talk to him, blasting some cheezy love song in the background, hoping that he would get a hint :)  It's amazing what silly things we did when we were younger to attract someone.  Sure made me giggle thinking about that!  Anyways, as you prolly figured I made it home safe and sound ... other than some brutal stretches of road it was a pretty productive trip, even after the bad start.  Sorry I missed you K & D :(  One happy note from trip ... picked up a bunch of really cool cobalt glass bottles and old jars from a thrift store.  Now I have more to add to my collection.  Well, I'm poopered and I need to go to bed!  Night all ... hope this next week is a good one for everyone ;)

      As you prolly guessed, I'm in a pissy mood!  One of my coworkers nearly drove me to drink today ... he/she kept blatantly ignoring customers and slacking off.  I hate that!  Of course, its snowing like an SOB outside, which would be because I have to travel this weekend.  And (as you saw in my last post) my computer is being a jerk.  Plus, my damn kidlets all need to have datebooks stapled to their foreheads.  So yeah, I'm feeling slightly grumpy.  I think I'm going to take my book and go have a bath until I feel human again.  Later.

       Today's lesson: STOP SIGNS ARE FOR EVERYONE!   I have to say right now, I am guilty of doing the "California Roll"  (also called by many other names).   That's when you come up to a stop sign and come to a rolling stop, then you go.  This Driving for Morons installment is not for the "rollers", it's for the "completely ignorers".  So, if you blatantly ignore stop signs ... Read on!  First, what is a stop sign?  Well, it's that thing at the end of the road.  It sits on top of a metal post.  It is red, with 8 sides and says "STOP" in the middle with great big letters.  Believe it or not, this 'sign' is there for more than you to gaze at like a piece of art.  (Note:  I do realize that stop signs and other road signs do make good art, I admit to having 'acquired' a few pieces of said art in my younger days.  But anyways ... That's another topic!)   Stop signs are at the end of roads  (and streets, lanes, etc.)  for a reason.  They are there to     get you to stop.  I would like to think that there is a reason behind almost every stop sign there is on the face of this planet.  Usually, it is because you are going to go onto another road which most likely will have other cars on it.  Now listen closely:  The  "other"  cars on that new road actually have something called the 'right of way'.  That means, you should stay out of their way!  This does not mean that you should completely ignore the stop sign and gun your way onto the next street causing other drivers to have to slam on their brakes to avoid smashing into you.  Some other things to note, the following do not give you special privileges to ignore stop signs completely: -a cell phone to your ear -an "N" or "L" sticker in your back window/on back bumper -having been a driver since Noah was a little boy -being old/being young -being male/being female -having a bigger vehicle -being blonde/red/brunette/gray/white/pink/etc. haired  Now I know that the proper procedure at a stop sign is:  "Come to a complete stop just before the line.  Look both ways.  If you are unable to see clearly, edge forward until you are able to do so.  Proceed once it is safe to do so."  But I'm realistic!  The only people who actually come to a stop for a full 2-3 seconds do it because they are a) taking their driver's exam b)they are driving as a job or c)there is a cop nearby.  Do the 'California Roll' if you have too ... Just don't ignore the stop sign completely.  It's a$$holes like you that cause accidents.  Smarten the heck up!  When you approach a stop sign, slow down.  Look both ways CAREFULLY.  If there is traffic, then don't go!  It's that simple.  Well, I hope that this clears up the stop sign.  If you like my Driving for Morons series, then stay tuned for future installments including "Brakes: Not all the @#@!# time!", "School Zone: Duh!" and "Cellphones: DON'T!"  Most of all,  DRIVE SAFELY!

      So yeah, today I worked until 5 and then I had 2 meetings.  I scheduled for 6 and one for 7.  The one at six was actually supposed to go until 7:30 or so.  So, you can imagine my utter annoyance when I leave the first meeting to arrive at the second meeting and find that no one was there.  What the hell!  So, I ended up going back to the first meeting and finishing it off ... I am so annoyed it isn't even funny.  I plan on giving the chair of the second meeting a huge earful when I see her next.  I just had to rant!  It's been a long day and I am heading to bed now.  Wish me luck that I'll actually get a full night of sleep (insomnia still).  Night!

      I can't believe it's Sunday night already!  This weekend has just ripped by ... Today I managed to keep fairly busy.  I slept in (what a hard life) and played hooky from Church (another late night due to no sleep again).  Went grocery shopping, went into work for a bit to do some gift displays.  Something amazing happened today ... I looked into my cupboards/fridge and ACTUALLY saw food!  I think I may have to try this grocery shopping thing more frequently.  Today I made a big pot of stock then soup and I made a stuffed pepper for dinner tomorrow and froze a bunch of extra stock, soup and stuffed pepper filling.  Watched the Simpsons, read my book, shaved my legs (LOL ... betcha you all wanted to know that :).  It's been a full day.  Now it's late and I must go to bed and hopefully to sleep right away.  Wish me luck!  Night reader-land.

      It's 1 in the morning and I cannot sleep ... so instead I am doing silly things trying to tire myself out enough that I can fall asleep.  I just love chronic insomnia.  Not that I can't sleep everynight, but I get bouts of it that last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.  Hopefully, this isn't a long one.  One a happy note, I watched Bruce Almighty tonight ... What a wonderful movie!  (Yes, I know it isn't exactly knew, but I'm behind the times what can I say?)  So, if you are behind the times like me and haven't seen it yet, I recommend it!  Well, I'm off to play some Poppit until I can no longer keep my eyes open.  Night all!

      Kay, I really don't think you understood the point of my last post ... Birthday = Bad ... DUH!   But not to be ungrateful, I wanted to say: Thanks Ma, for the really, really early phone call (sorry didn't answer, couldn't manage to make it from bed to phone ... it WAS before 7am!) and for the cool candle holder! Thanks Meio Formiga & Squiggles for wishes & early present!  Thanks Necy for calling and making me feel better cause I really needed a pick-me-up and kidlets ... specially M's "knock knock joke". Thanks friends who gave wishes! (And for those of you who forgot, screw you hippies!)  Anyways, I took this quiz and I wanted to share ...    You are  Spearmint . You are quick-witted and sharp.  You pay close attention to details and you can tell what your friends are feeling.  You are always the first to understand a joke and you are valued for your insight and advice.  However, you sometimes isolate yourself from other people, afraid to share your own feelings.

      It's so cold, that you can't lick your lips or your tongue will stick to them!  It's so cold that if you spat, it would freeze before reaching the ground!  It's so cold, that I had to turn my heat up and I was actually cold at work**!  It's so cold, that I would much rather be inside under my blanky vegging on the couch!  It's so cold, that my hot water tank  (which is located in the mailroom)  actually froze and stopped working  (okay, it didn't freeze, the pipes coming out of it did)  and I had to help my landlord "unfreeze" them!  These are my current thoughts ... now I'm going back to my couch and warm blanky to watch a dvd.  Night!   **This is quite something, considering I am constantly complaining that it is bloody hot while everyone else is wearing 6 layers and complaining that they are freezing their a$%es off**

      I just spent the last 20 minutes listening to some foolish prat at the Laundromat ... This little punk came in, dialed someone on the payphone, then sat down on the bench and took his boots off!  Make yourself at home buddy.  He then spent the next 20 minutes crying on the phone to what I am guessing was his ex or soon to be ex partner.   "I am a nice guy you know"  snivel, snivel.   "Is it the drugs?  Cause if its the drugs, I won't do them anymore."   Meanwhile, I'm sending mental messages to whoever is on the other line,  'this guy is a loser and you are better off without him!'   I just love the line  "... I won't do them anymore"   Yeah, right!  And the Pope isn't a Catholic.  Have I mentioned that I hate the local Laundromat?  No matter what day or time I go, I always get to witness something fun: Two gentlemen coming in to make a drug deal, The chatty bimbo who can't figure out where to put her loonie, The annoying kid who has snot dribbling down their face and wants to play ... The list goes on and on.  You know, this town is filled with a bunch of goobers who should all be on Prozac or Riddlin.  A town filled with welfare milkers  (Note:  I don't have a problem with someone receiving welfare or assistance, sometimes you are down and you need a little help.  I am referring to the multitude in this town who are milking the system for money that they don't really need as they have something on the side, whether it's selling crack or doing jobs under the table ... And believe me, there are a lot in this town) , druggies and alcoholic bums.  People wonder why I am not trying to date?????  Hello!  Anyways, that's enough ranting for one day!  Have a nice week ...

      I am actually feeling much calmer today!  I played hooky from my meeting last night and went out for coffee with Sourdough instead.  I really needed to take just one night and chill ... I'm super glad I did, because today I felt much less stressed.  I had a performance review at work today.  It is funny how some people getted all freaked out about them.  Why get freaked out?  I figure if I am doing anything really wrong or terrible, they are going to tell me and not wait for my once-a-year performance review.  So, why get all freaked out?  They aren't going to tell me anything earth-shattering.  Today was no exception to that.  Well, I'm off to do some tidying and pack for my trip so I can leave right after work tomorrow.  Have a good weekend!

      This last week and a half seems like it has been a month!  Things have been soooo bloody hectic ... I survived Edmonton and my Ski Weekend.  You would think that things would slow down now, but NOOOOO!  I had a meeting last night, a meeting tomorrow night and I have to go away again this weekend for another meeting and then come home for another meeting on Monday night.  I thought, for a few minutes, after that is done maybe I can slow down???  HA!!  Wishful thinking on my part ... then I have to put in extra hours at work to make room for all of the wonderful new stuff that we bought for the store while in Edmonton.  LOL ... My life is currently a whirlwind!  Maybe even a hurricane or tornado.  That's my current ... I will try and write again later this week, or next week, or sometime soon!  PS ... So if you haven't heard from me in ages and ages, you know why!  I'll have to catch up with you later!  PPS ... GOOD LUCK SISSY ON YOUR JOB INTERVIEW ON THURSDAY AND THANKS FOR THE LETTER, GOT IT TONIGHT!  LOVE YOU!  PPPS ... Squiggles & Mint I'll see you this weekend, hope you remembered!  I'll call you later in week to make plans.

      This week has been like a bloody roller coaster ride ... One of those crazy ones too, not a weenie one!  But, despite all that I am calm!  I have the day off tomorrow to get things in order before I go away ... Of course,  I have some thing that I have to do - like pack, get an oil change in my car, do laundry, see the Vagina Monologues.  Did I say tomorrow will be calm???  What was I thinking???  I'll prolly spend the day running around like a chicken with my head cut-off!  At least I got stuff worked out with school ... I got my acceptance letter WAY earlier than expected and 2 weeks to pay my HUGE deposit.  Damn, I wish I could just pull $$ out of my a$$!!  Obviously, the school thought that I could.  Anyways, I phoned them today and worked out that it's okay if I pay a couple of weeks late.  I was really freaking out about it and even cried yesterday when I got the letter ... I had visions of no school dashing through my head.  So, when I phoned them this morning and found out it was okay, I had another cry ... This one in relief though, not frustration!  I'm am a tad bit nervous about being away for the whole week before one of my kidlet events.  I am confident that my kidlets can handle everything, but can't help being nervous anyways.  I've NEVER been away for the whole week prior to an event before.  My chairperson has the # at the hotel though, so if there is anything drastic we'll just have to deal with it as it happens.  Of course, nothing drastic is going to happen (and I just have to keep telling myself that).  Well, it seems as if I am rambling and I should really be finishing the housework I need to do.  I don't know when I'll blog again, since I am away off & on until the end of the month.  So, have a great rest of February and for all you couples I hope you have a good V Day (excuse me while I barf now!).     PS ... HAPPY 10TH BIRTHDAY TO MY NEPHEW R. ON THE 19TH!!!!  I HOPE IT'S A GOOD ONE AND I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU!  XOXOXOXOXOXO

       It's been one of  "those"  weeks so far ... AND IT'S ONLY TUESDAY!   I think I may be bald by the end of the week due to pulling all of my hair out.  Won't that be fun.  At least I won't have to style it in the morning :)  Well, I'm off to work my a$$ off a little more.  Hope your week is better than mine.

      I'd be excited, except I am up really freakin' early cause I have to work ... although, I guess I should get used to it, cause next year I'll prolly have to work every Saturday.  I'm cheesed cause Sarah McLachlan (one of my all time fave musicians) is coming to Calgary, but she is playing on a Wednesday night.  WHY WEDNESDAY?  WHY NOT THE WEEKEND?  Needless to say, I most likely won't be able to go ... excuse me while I go and pout now.  I did manage to successfully purchase a pair of pants (Thanks  urlLink Sour  for coming with me) the other day - khaki cords and they are soooo soft!  Well, I suppose I should go and get ready for work ... cause I really, really want to go this morning.  Hope you have a good weekend!

      Okay, I did it ... I finally managed to upload my webpage onto my website.  Only took me 5 billion days, cause of too much junk to list!   So, my new website is called  urlLink BANANALAND   and if you visit it, please keep in mind that there are a thousand things that need fixing (ie. Broken links, missing images, etc.), but it is my first ever website built entirely (except I didn't create the pictures) by me!  (applause, applause)  So, now I will spend the next few days tweaking and adding and fixing.  PHEW!  It was a big job, but I feel good about finally accomplishing this.  I've wanted to build my own site for a long time.  Well, I'm off to the 'mall' to buy a new pair of work pants (YUCK).  I just  LOVE  shopping, as you all know.  Hope you are having a good week!

      Ever have one of those days where if you didn't need your job to pay bills, you'd quit?  That was soooo my day today!  One thing that really sucks about working with all women is that they are super catty and today was no exception to that.  I wanted to scream at 2 of my coworkers, "At least wait until I am out of earshot!!!!"  But instead I just bit my tongue and walked away.  So yeah, today was "one of those days".  Just wanted to share!

      So, I finally broke down and I am building my own website!  I spent almost all day yesterday working on it ... It's going to be simple with links to my 2 blogs, youth ministry resources and possibly my driving for morons stuff.  My sissy lent me this fabulous book that lays everything out in simple terms and I found that once I got going, the html thing isn't as bad as I thought it would be!  Now all I have to do is figure out the whole hosting issue and hopefully it will be up soon ... I'll keep you posted!  Well, it's been a long day and I am going to bath and read my book.  Night!

      Today was laundry day.  If you've read my blog in the past, then you know what a colourful place my local Laundromat can be  (drug deals, weirdos, etc.)  ... Well, today was NO exception!  I put my laundry in and then went for a walk around town and then took my time choosing a movie  (less time I actually spend at the Laundromat, the better!)   .  So, I got back and put my stuff in the dryer ... Curled up on a bench with my book, ignoring the world!  First, this young bum comes in begging me for money  (sob story and all).   I'm thinking,  "You're barking up the wrong tree buddy!  If I was loaded, I sure as heck wouldn't be doing my laundry at the Laundromat!"   but I just politely say no, remembering that he was the one talking on the phone a while past about his drug problem.  Then, when I'm folding my laundry, one of the town crazies comes in ... I tried my hardest to ignore him while discretely folding my more 'personal' items.  He just kept blabbing on and on and on and on and on and on  (well you get the picture) .   HE PROPOSED TO ME!    Oh yeah, life just can't get any better than that, folks.    Him:  My dad always told me to get a steady job, buy a house and then settle down with a woman. Me: {grunt} Him:  I would take care of her, she wouldn't have to work. Me: {grunt} Him:  I would buy her everything that she wants.  If she wanted a car, I would take her to the lot and say 'Pick one'. Me:  That's nice. Him:  You are a pretty young lady. Me:  Thanks. Him:  I would take care of you.  I am rich. Me:  Ummm ... (thinking WHAT?????) Him:  We could get married.  I would buy you anything you wanted and we could live in a house. Me:  Oh, I'm already married! Him:  You don't have a ring.  I would buy you a big ring.   At this point, I grabbed my laundry basket and rushed for the door ... Which he opened for me.  I got in my car and locked the door.  He followed me to my car and kept talking to me even as I was driving away.  That folks, is another fine example of why I am not dating!  I know he is just one of the local crazies and is truly harmless, but he is also an example of the fine class of gentlemen available in this community.  How was your Sunday??

      I finally managed to get a picture of my brother up on my Relay for Life page (see link on the right if you are interested) ... thank you too Squiggles and Mint for scanning & such!  I am happy to say that I have raised $165.00 so far and the event is still almost 2 months away!!  Thank you to everyone who has donated so far and keep it coming!  I am hoping to raise at least $250.00

      Everyday after work, I walk buy the local credit union on the way to my car.  The have a bunch of signs on their building that say "ARE YOU GETTING ANY?" with a picture of a man kissing a wad of cash.  It just reminds me EVERYDAY that I'm not getting any ... wads of cash OR the other "thing".  So, driving to the mall today after work, what do I see????  A massive billboard with the same thing.  Is the world out to get me?  Do they HAVE to rub it in????  I did feel a bit better when on a whim I decided to pop into the local bookstore to see if a book I've been dying to read has finally made it to paperback - I almost 'whooped' in the store when I saw that it is!  YAY ... new book to read!  Well, I'm off to the Okanagan this weekend with my youthy's for a planning meeting.  Talk to you when I get back ... have a good weekend!

I really must hurry up and win billions so that I can have a full time housecleaner.  You know someone to do dishes, vacuum, wash & iron laundry, clean bathroom, etc.  Well, I am going to go and have a delusion about having a house keeper now!  Have a good night.

      Have you ever had such a realistic dream that you wake up upset?  I woke up before 7 this morning bawling because I had a dream that one of my friends was really sick and dying.  I dreamed that I was visiting him in the hospital and his family gave me an envelope from him and it had his wishes of what he wanted done when he passed.  I dreamed I was sitting by his side in the hospital room, holding his hand and rubbing his head.  I was really upset, he was unconcious ... then I woke up.  I was so upset from this dream, that I woke up bawling.  I wanted to phone him right then and there to make sure he was okay ... but I didn't.  It was really early and I didn't want to get laughed at for being silly.  But, I can't help but feel worried that there is something wrong on his part ... and hoping that I am wrong and it was just a silly dream.  Had to go to the lovely laundromat to do laundry today ... remember the guy, from my previous tales, who was on the phone with his g/f and had a drug problem?  Well, he was in the laundromat today WITH a girl and his (or her?) mother, a little kid and what I am assuming is the dad.  Well, this guy and his g/f (?) sat on the bench and practically humped while the mother did all the work and the kid picked nose and annoyed everyone and the dad went on a drug run.  Special eh???  Well, it gets better ... dad comes back and empties part of his baggy on a washing machine and procides to roll a joint.  Then guy and dad light up said joint in the laundromat and begin smoking it while they head towards the door.  Luckily, at that point my laundry was done and I got to leave.  I guess I should be happy cause doing my laundry is never boring ... but I really hate the local laundromat!  Well, I'm going to go and read/snooze on my couch.  Have a good Monday tomorrow!

      Well, I survived the interview and I think that I will most likely get a job offer out of it!  Now I just have to play the waiting game.  I hope that I get it, because it is working with kids and that is what I love to do ...  On a 'funner' note ... if you share the really strange sense of humour that I have, then you HAVE to see "Jane White is Sick and Twisted".  It is an absolutely hilarious cheesy B movie that is on the newer release shelf.  I rented it on Saturday and have watched it several times already!  This is the synopsis:  Ahhh… the young Jane White. Raised by television, and home schooled by her agoraphobic mother, Jane has a unique perception of the world. Jane escapes in prime time episodes and tries desperately to get on the Gerry Show... the most outrageous TV talk show in media history. Jane knows that by appearing on the show she will be reunited with Gerry, her long lost father.    It stars some really awesome actors such as Kim Little and Wil Wheaton, as well as cast from Who's Line is It Anyways, Saved by the Bell, the Wonder Years, the Brady Bunch, SNL and more!  Anyways, I just wanted to say that this is a freakin' hilarious movie and you may like it!!!!  I need to go to bed now, cause I'm poopered (couldn't sleep past 4am this morning).  Goodnight!

      So, I have an interview tomorrow night for this job that I kind of want, working with kids ... I really hate telephone interviews, I would rather be able to see the face of the person interviewing me.  I'm kinda nervous.  I really hate interviews.  I'm sure it will go fine, cause I'm gonna have the attitude of "why should I work for you" instead of "you should hire me".  Okay, I'm done with my nervous ranting for now!  I'll post tomorrow night and let you know how it went ...

      Have I mentioned that I am a genius?  I finally figured out my whole "email program not working" problem ... Turns out when I got rid of that stupid virus I had, it had been using a driver that my email program was using.  So, the driver had been deleted along with the virus.  Anyways, make a long story short, after beating my head repeatedly against the wall ... It is finally fixed!  YAYYYY!!  That makes me super happy, but super busy cause I had a bunch of email to catch up on that I had no idea I had.  Oh well!  Today I have a day off, and last night I stayed up way to late.  So, I slept until noon today!  It was so nice to sleep in like that.  Right now, it's almost 3 and I am still in my pajamas.  I do need to get off the computer and shower and run errands though ... Nice to be lazy once and a while though!  Happy Monday everyone ;-}

She read my blog and is now starting her own Relay for Life team.  I think that is really quite wonderful!!  I added a little blurb to the bottom of my Relay message ... why not get involved by registering a team yourself or even volunteering at the event?  I will be participating as a team member and as part of the planning committee organizing the event and as a volunteer the day of the event as well.  I think that as the date approaches, I will post things such as how I am doing fundraising and even some team/individual fundraising suggestions ... I hope you won't all get sick and tired of this, but TOO BAD!  I am really passionate about this. Well, I need to get off the computer and make supper.  I am supposed to go for coffee with Sour tonight and she will be grumpy  (love you Sour!)  if I take too long!  Hope you all have a wonderful Friday night.

      It's Tuesday and today I just want to say thank you for those who have made donations to support me in the Relay for Life.  You'll notice that I put a new blurb about it on the right of the screen.  I plan on putting a picture up of my brother also ... once I get something scanned in.  I've already raised $140!!!  I originally set my fundraising goal at $100, so I upped it to $250 and who knows, maybe I'll have to up it again!  Thank you everyone!!!!  Went out for dinner tonight with my work, since we have someone retiring.  I am really sad that A is retiring, she is awesome ... and I am sure going to miss her smiling face.  It was a nice dinner and everyone spoke nicely about her.  Well, it's late and I should be heading to bed!  Happy Tuesday everyone.  Hope your 'hump day' is a good one!

      Sour and I had a hair dying party this afternoon ... I decided spring called for a lighter shade of brown with a redish hue.  She decided on a blonder shade.  This is the lightest I have ever dyed my hair :)  I like it!  Otherwise, I did two presentations on Relay at the local highschool ... caused one little girl to run from the room crying ... Cancer is a touchy subject.  Well, I'm going to nap on the couch :) Hope you had a good Monday!

      I don't think I have another creative ounce left in my body!  I have been madly displaying all week, putting in extra time ... I don't think I could make one more creative display if I tried!  Thank goodness I have the next 2 days off to re-energize.  I think I will nap tomorrow afternoon, after church.  Monday I have to go to the local high school to do a presentation on Relay for Life, which I am participating in.  So, if you are feeling generous, you could pledge some money to my team.  All you have to do is click this  urlLink link  and donate with your credit card.  The money will go towards helping to find a cure for Cancer, which is dear and near to my heart.  You will even get a loverly tax-deductible receipt!  Well, that's all I have to say today!  Hope you are having an exciting weekend.

      Okay, I have officially ended the reign of plumber's crack.  I finally broke down and bought myself a belt.  You know, when one of your coworker's gives your undies a yank, it's time to break down and buy a belt.  Needless to say, as soon as I got off work today, that is what I did.  I just wanted to share ...

      Why do people play head games?  You know, if you tell someone you are going to do something, do it.  If you don't want to do something, than don't tell someone that you are going to.  That drives me bloody nuts.  Sorry, it's late and I'm being slightly cryptic.  Karaoke was okay.  It was really awesome to spend some time with R ... I miss her.  Got to see T and his g/f D which was nice.  It's pretty sad that it takes a friend coming in from out-of-town for us to see eachother though.  I'm feeling all out of whack ... I found out tonight that my retarded a$$hole ex trashed the house that we had been sharing (I moved out way before he did this) before he moved out.  You know, I can't help feeling embarassed and wondering what the landlords must think of me.  I know that  I  didn't trash the place, but I associated with  that  and it makes me look bad too.  I dunno.  I know that I shouldn't let it bother me, but it does.  I wish that was one mistake (the ex) that I could erase from my history.  He caused so much damage and I was so blind.  Maybe that is why I don't spend a lot of time with T & D cause for some reason, the ex always comes up when I see them.  Maybe it is because I am a recluse.  I dunno ... well, I think I may be rambling and I should prolly make my way to bed.  Here's hoping I am feeling better in the morning.  Night.

      Yay!  I'm going to Karaoke tonight!!  I haven't been to karaoke in ages and ages, but my friend R. is home for a visit and she has demanded that I join her ... of course, I'm not complaining because I LOOOOOOVE karaoke!  When she still lived her, we used to go almost every week.  Otherwise, this week has been pretty busy with extra time at work.  I was planning on working some extra time today, but by the time came to put in my extra time I decided I had enough and I couldn't possibly creatively display one more thing!  I'll put in some more extra time tomorrow instead.  Chopped lots of my hair off today ... PHEW!  Hadn't had a haircut since before Christmas.  AND ... I actually went grocery shopping!  I think that my fridge and cupboards are currently singing "Hallelujah" in 4 part harmony.  I haven't really grocery shopped in about a month because I was away so much.  What's the point of having food go bad?  I was really good in the grocery store tonight too, cause I stuck to my menu and only bought what I needed plus a few treats :)~  I even bought whole wheat stuff.  I still wish that there was more veggie selection in this bloody town though! Well, I should get off the puter and shower cuz I really hate the scratchy feeling of little hairs on my back.  BLEGH!  Night!

      Well, I'm home again for a few weeks anyways!  February was crazy ... I think I need some vacation time just to catch up on everything!!  Now,  I am doing extra time at work to make room for all of the wonderful new stuff we bought for the store!  Oh joy, I really hate condensing (aka: shoving to make it all fit)!  Some good news ... My car brakes work super well!  A crazy, demon-possessed deer helped me to figure that one out.  The damn kama-kazi deer jumped off of a !5 (or so) foot bank beside the road and landed nearly at the yellow line and then sprinted across the remainder of the road.  So, that is how I know that my brakes work.  Oh, and adrenaline makes my tremor much worse.  Well, I shall have to get mine buttocks to bed!  I will be dragging tomorrow if I don't!  B, if you are reading this ... It was nice chatting with you tonight!  Sissy, congrats on getting  the job and don't fret, it will work out!  Squiggles, hope the job hunt was successful.  Minty, hope the finger (aka worm looking thing) is healing.  Ma, you alive?  Sam I Am, I'm still here!  And everyone else, hello!  Hope you are having a good week!

      I just finished watching parts of the Dalai Lama's round-table discussion on CBC.  This was a round table discussion between His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Tutu and several other wonderful spiritual leaders.  They all had such wonderful messages to share about peace and compassion.  At the end of the show, they showed some of the interaction between the different guests while they were waiting to go on stage.  One of the images that really struck me as beautiful was the Dalai Lama holding Archbishop Tutu's hand and stroking it in a very loving manner.  It was very beautiful and very moving.

      I am so SMRT ... Packed my lunch, etc. like I usually do and off I went to work this morning.  Went on my lunch break and opened my lunch container and I found ... my margarine.   (I can't afford real tupperware, so I use "poor man's tupperware" ie. leftover plastic containers)   It would seem that I put my lunch in the fridge and took my margarine instead this morning.  Pretty smrt eh?  Luckily, I had a couple of bucks and was able to get some lunch at Subway.  What a great way to start off this week ... How was your Monday???

      Well, I managed to survive my week ... it was iffy there for a while, but I made it :)~  Today is my only day off this weekend, so I slept in and played hooky from church.  I spent a lazy day, mostly reading Sacajewea (good book BTW).  Well, I'm off to be lazy more ... have a good week this week!

      I really hate cheap people.  Someone that I work with needs to buy a wedding shower gift but they are the cheapest person EVER!  They should prolly shop somewhere else where prices are in the cheap range (like the Dollar Store), BUT NO!  They absolutely have to buy it from work.  So, they waste my time asking me for suggestions and lots of stupid questions, like "Do we have this in blue?".  I'm thinking, "DO YOU SEE IT IN BLUE? NO? WELL THEN...!" Then they spend the next 2 hours whining about how expensive everything is.  ARRRRGGGHHH!  Then, they put a bunch of cheap stuff together and I'm thinking good it's all over.  NO, OF COURSE NOT.  Instead they whine some more and then when I am on my lunch break, they "put it away".  By putting it away I mean, they do a half-assed job of putting stuff back on the shelf and left some of it ON THE FLOOR in front of the shelf.  By this point, I had to give myself a time out because I was so angry that I could have blown!  I really hate cheap people like that.  To top it off, this person ended up buying some crap from our clearance sidewalk sale (and I mean CRAP) saying "I don't really need this ... I don't know what I'll do with this."  Geeez,  they should have spent that money on the wedding shower gift instead!!!!!  I also hate parents who don't parent.  There was this lady in the store today who had a child from hell.  In fact, I think that this child was probably satan himself re-incarnated.  This kid was in everything, climbing everything and generally behaving badly.  I have to tell the kid to stop because the parent isn't paying attention.  Then, and only then, parent says "oh, don't do that".  I ended up having to do something else and skipped the remainder of their visit to the store (oh shucks).  Turns out Little Satan climbed into the display windown and was touching everything and didn't want to get out.  So what does the mother do?  She buys the kid a $30 elephant statue that he likes, just to get him out of the window.  HELLO?????  This was after the kid got felts, crayons and a notebook.  Let's just re-inforce your bad behaviour Little Satan.  F$%K.  That was my day today .... IS IT THE WEEKEND YET?????????

      I hate gossipy people, they suck!  Yesterday, I had a visitor in my store, a lady who lives in the town I grew up in. Her: Remember me? Me: Uhhhh ... Her: You know, Mrs. W!  I used to be your neighbour. Me: Unn, sure (with a wonderful fake grin plastered to my face) Her: I just have to give you a hug.  Oh my you look the same as when you were little. This was followed by 50 billion questions about me, my family and everything else under the sun.  To top it off, I tend to keep my personal life PERSONAL.  This means, I don't like to talk about stuff that's personal at work ... so you can just imagine all the little ears that perked up at this.  To top it off, this lady was never my neighbour ... she lived SEVERAL blocks away.  I'm sure she can't wait to go home and tell EVERYONE and their dog that she saw me and stuff.  So yeah ... my special moment of yesterday.

      Currently, I have stuck in my head the song "Oh Wasn't That a Party".  You know the one ...  mighta been the gin, could've been the 2-4-6 pack I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in.  my head is like a football, i think i'm gonna die, singing me-o-me-o-my, oh wasn't that a party!"  (I may not have all of the words right, but you get the gist)  I would have loved to have been in Vancouver this last weekend, to listen to some very great people speak … especially the Dalai Lama (sp?) and Archbishop Tutu.  I think that they both would have been very interesting to listen to and that they would have spoken messages worth hearing.  I am jealous of all the people who were able to listen to them/meet them over the last few days.  The Canucks lost to the Flames last night … I didn’t get to watch all of the game, but what I did catch was exciting.  I thought for sure that the game was lost and then they scored with only a few seconds left!  It took me by surprise when the Flames scored the tiebreaker in overtime.  Oh well!  I was feeling creative at work today, which is good because I got a lot done … I finished my little project and now I am working on fixing up displays, since I spent most of the last month unpacking and not focusing on nice displays.  I have started at the back of the store and my “plan” is to work my way to the front, displaying and cleaning as I go.  That will keep me busy for at least a couple of weeks.  Well, I have to get ready for a meeting.  I hope everyone had an enjoyable Tuesday!  Goodnight.  PS … Pouty Pants, I am still coming for your birthday.  Silly girl!  Karate doesn’t start until the 3rd.

      At work, on Saturday, I started re-arranging displays ... and then I started moving shelves and - wouldn't you know it - it turned into a bigger project than I thought!  So, I ended up going into work today (around doing a presentation at a local school & errands) to try and finish this project I started.  Looks like I will be working at it again tomorrow :) Oh well, what can you do ... it's improving things in the long run!  I have to finish off tomorrow though, cause Weds we are starting a 4 day sidewalk sale (barf!).  Guess what???  I signed up to take Karate!  I have decided that I have gained a few pounds through winter and it is time for me to get off my tookus and do some exercise.  My regular walking partner has been ill, so we haven't walked in ages and ages ... so I'm slightly out of shape at the moment.  So, the local parks & rec thingy came in the mail and I've been eyeballing this Karate course for a long time and decided 'what the heck'!  It isn't very expensive and it's on nights of the week that are good for me ... Starting May 1st, I will be doing this 2 nights a week.  Just think of all the pounds that will come off!  I was in karate when I was little and I really enjoyed it then, so I am hoping that this karate is a similar style and that it will all come back to me quickly.  Wow,  urlLink  Meio Formiga   ACTUALLY posted on his blog ... I am so shocked!!!!  He hardly ever blogs.  Well, I best get off the computer and do my stupid dishes.  Anyone want to come to my house and do them for me?  I hate washing dishes!  Night!

      In response to Squiggles, who asks where the other half of the money raised from the RELAY FOR LIFE goes:  The other half goes towards things like patient support (like having a visit from a trained volunteer) and emergency aid (so that patients can get to appointments and such if they can't afford it). The cost of running the event is covered by corporate sponsorship, so ALL the money raised goes towards research, emergency aid and patient support.  If you want to know more about it, just click this  urlLink  LINK  !  Thank you Squiggles for raising this really valuable question.  I think that it is really important that organizations like this can be accountable as to where the money is going!  Have a good weekend everyone.

      Yeah, so now EVERYBODY and their dog at work knows that I am going to school in the fall and will be quitting.  I got grilled ALL day about what my plans are and "Oh, I'm so happy for you".  That was my day!

      Right now it is hotter than Hades in my apartment and the jackass above me has control of the heat ... of course, SHE is prolly freezing and cranked up the heat ... meanwhile I am boiling hot and am thinking of sleeping outside.  I may have to go and pound on her door and wake her up.  GRRR ... never had heat/cold problems with any of the other tenants, but this one likes to do stupid things like crank it up and then go away for the weekend.  I think I may have to scream!!!!  Okay, I may be just a tad bit tired & cranky.  I'm going to go open my window all the way and attempt to sleep.  Night all.

      Well, the cat is finally out of the bag ... I have officially announced at work that I will be quitting to return to school in the Fall.  I felt like I was going to vomit, I was somewhat nervous, so I just kind of blurted it out.  Not quite the eloquent speech that I planned ... but I am glad to finally have said something, now I don't have to watch what I say.  I do still have a job, they didn't fire me LOL.  Anyways, that is my exciting news for today.  Happy HUMP Day :)

      Well, my long weekend was nice and relaxing ... Hung out with friends and had a good time ... Until the ending with a twist.  Ended up having to go up to the ER on Sunday night because of an allergic reaction to God only knows what.  It wasn't a major reaction, but of course I got caught with my pants down (ie. No allergy medication on hand).  This is so unlike me, as I am super conscientious about having stuff on hand ... It was a really strange reaction too.  Eyes that were tearing like a water fall with a burning itch, slight swelling of the throat and numbness of lips and tongue.  Not a major reaction by all means, but somewhat disconcerting nonetheless.  Sourdough brought me some Claritin and after a while of that not doing anything, I decided we should prolly head up to the ER "just in case".  The doctor on call was a total crack-pot.  I have a tremor, I shake.  When I am feeling distressed, I shake worse.  I told this to the nurse, who recorded it on my chart.  So, when the doctor finally arrives, she asks me if I am having a panic attack cause I am shaking.  I felt like jamming that clipboard down her throat.  I hate having to explain my tremor, especially to a medical professional who obviously didn't bother to read my chart and was being ignorant.  Anyways, they gave me some Benadryl and sent me on home once the swelling started to ease.  Needless to say, I spent most of today sleeping which is what Benadryl does for me.  I think the package should say  "don't make any plans for at least 24 hours."   I felt really bad for the guy in the cubicle next to me ... He was also having an allergic reaction and his eyes were almost completely swollen shut.  The doctor kept asking him if he is a nervous person.  Was he having a panic attack?  Is his job/life stressful?  Yeesh, I felt indignant for him since it was so obviously an allergic reaction of some sort.  They did nothing for him, just sent him home and told him to buy some drops the next day.  I think the doctor was maybe slightly retarded or something (very politically correct, I know)  Poor guy.  He said he had 2 exams to be written the next day too ... What fun that would be with eyes swollen shut.  Pollen/pollution level must be really bad here right now, cause the nurse said that was 3 allergy patients that night and all were complaining about burning eyes.  Needless to say, I survived my "ordeal" and I will prolly sleep like a baby again tonight.  How was your Easter?!!?

      Yay ... it's a long weekend!  And something exciting ... I saw   urlLink this  and I must say that I like it!!!!!  I've been in love with the PT Cruiser since it was just a concept that I read about in a magazine.  I think I want one ... so hurry up and win the lottery and buy me one!  Maybe my Mife will buy me one?  Anyways, I'm starting to go cross-eyed and I should prolly go to bed seeing as I have to get up early and go to church (Good Friday, eh).  Happy Easter!

      Wouldn't you know it ... I actually get a weekend off where I don't have to go away and I don't have anything planned.  What happens????  Why Daylight Savings Time of course.  Last night I switched my clock ahead before going to bed.  Do you think I could sleep?  NO!  I tossed and turned until almost 4 am.  I think this was my bodies way of protesting the time change in advance or something!  I slept until noon because of the late night.  In fact, I think I am really just all out of sorts.  I thought that maybe I had Monday off,  but I was for some reason reading the April schedule for last year ... Yeah, it's been one of THOSE weekends.  While, I'm off to cross the border and get some gas (20 cents cheaper at that).  Hope you are having a better weekend than I am!

      This has been a really long week ... I have been unpacking, pricing and displaying like mad.  Now I am definitely cursing all of the stuff that we bought at the gift show!  Damn I hate bulk displaying ... oh well!  The other day, I worked from 9 am to 7:45 pm (yes, I did take a couple of breaks) and it was a crazy long day.  Today I am off to work on my day off to do ... guess what ... more unpacking, pricing and displaying! (LOL) Man, I took my friend to the emerg last night (poor thing, hope you're feeling better!) and we were there until 1:00 in the morning.  Gotta love little hospitals.  Well, I must get my butt off to work, I'm already going later than planned.  Have a good weekend!

      Well, I survived Relay ... It was a crazy super long weekend, but one that was totally worth it.  I raised $265!!!  Thank you to everyone who donated money.  My team raised almost $2000 all together.  The day ran really smoothly, thanks to our wonderful committee, and in total our event raised over $130,000!!!!  I am really glad that I was able to volunteer again this year, but also that I was able to participate.  The whole day was an experience I will never forget.  I took some pictures of the luninaries (part of the closing ceremonies).  As soon as I get some more batteries for my camera, I will upload and post them.  We did inventory at the store yesterday, and after being up late and having such a long day (@ Relay from 8am to 1am) it was really hard to concentrate.  I went to work wearing my jogging pants and slippers :) Luckily, it was just inventory and I could get away with it.  I got home yesterday afternoon and sat down on my couch ... I woke up a few hours later.  Guess maybe I was tired!  So, now it's Monday and I luckily have a day off to recuperate!  I slept in this morning and I will go to bed early tonight.  Did I mention that I got my first ever massage on Saturday?  They had people on-site @ Relay doing massages for a donation to the Cancer Society.  So I decided to try it.  When I was getting massaged, it felt great!  Except about 4 hours later, I started to hurt ... who knew that the muscles in your ass could hurt so much?!?!  Well, I am going to go and eat dinner and get ready for my karate class.  If I don't write again for a few days, have a good week!

      So, I had this meeting last night ... and afterwards we were loading some stuff into one of the committee members vehicles.  There were a bunch of bike riders in the parking lot, and I made the crap-head comment of "MMMM ... men in spandex.  What a nice site!" (of course, I was dripping with sarcasm - in case you missed it)  I had to go back into the office for a couple of minutes and when I left, almost everyone else had gone already.  So, I step out and what do I see in the parking lot???  A half-naked man.  And I mean HALF-NAKED.  He was wearing absolutely nothing but skin on his bottom half.  No biggy, a naked butt, right?  Until he turned around.  Geez, talk about modest.  I think I must have been as red as a bloody stop sign.  Yeah.

      At Karate last night, we did: 1100 Punches 600 Kicks 330 Crunches 110 Push Ups AND THAT WAS JUST THE WARM-UP!  And I would also like to add that all of the punches we done in what's called the horse stance.  Picture standing with your legs spread twice your shoulder width apart and then pretty much sitting downwards (think riding a horse).  I HURT!  Eventhough the instructor kept reminding us beginners that we could rest if need be, I did all of it!  I am proud.  That's my share for the day.

I think that it would be an unforgettable experience and something that I would enjoy.  I am adding this to my list of "Stuff to Do".  That's my current thought ... but now it is late and I have to get up early.  Night all!

      Well, it's officially my weekend!  I am glad for that ... I am going to sleep in tomorrow (YAY!).  Thank you to S. and family for their generous donation.  I have now exceeded my goal of raising $250 for the Relay for Life and have once again move my goal upwards to $300!  So, only $35 till I reach my new goal and only 2 weeks and 1 day until the event!  Did I mention I got my registry date?  I am set to register on June 7th and I can't wait!!!  Don't know what all I am going to take, although Psych & Sociology are on my "Must take" list.  I only plan on doing 3 courses my 1st semester since it's been ages since I've been in school ... So I am waffling between 3 or 4 courses to fill the 3rd spot.  It's so tough to decide!  One thought I had today that I want to share ... People, brush your teeth before you go out into public.  There is nothing more disgusting than some stranger's morning breath in your face.  It should just be a morning routine: Shower, deodorant, brush teeth.  What's so hard about that?  I cannot believe the number of customers I have served in the morning who have "death mouth".  What is up with that????  I survived my 2nd week of karate lessons, although I am beginning to think that my abs may NEVER stop hurting.  Last night we did 250 crunches.  That's right, 250!  5 sets of 50.  I'm beginning to think that my instructor may be a distant relative of Satan (joking ... I really like him).  I can handle the crunches, despite sore abs, but I really stink at push ups!  Well, I best get off of the puter and into bed.  Night and if I don't write again this weekend, have a good one!  PS ... 6 DAYS SISSY!!!!!

      Karate was challenging last night ... It turns out that Monday night's class is with the intermediate class.  So, it was slightly faster paced.  My body aches in places that I didn't even know existed!  But, it's a good ache.  Woke up at 4am with a raunchy migraine and ended up sleeping away most of today.  Thank goodness for sick days.  Anyways, I'm off to bed ... just wanted to write a little blurb.  Night!

      You know, some people really chap my a$$ ... Someone has been complaining to my mother that no one ever visits my grandmother, who lives in a home.  First of all, none of us live in the same town as her.  Second, my grandmother has advanced Alzeihmer's and doesn't remember much.  I would like to know HOW it is that the complainers know whether or not we've been to visit???? It's not like we have to sign in with someone everytime ... I just find her and visit with her when I go.  It's not like she remembers everytime I have been there.  Most of the time she doesn't have any idea who I am.  People should just mind there own business.  We all  love our grandmother, and just because we cannot visit her everyday or week does not mean that we love her any less.  I even phone the home once a month just to check up on how she is doing.  Anyways, that's my rant for today.  Hope you are enjoying your weekend!

      Well, it's the day after my 1st Karate class and I am feeling okay!  My muscles aren't killing me and I wasn't whiny today at all.  If fact, I am still feeling rather exhilarated!  My abs are slightly tender and just before I went to sleep my ankles felt a bit tired, but it's worth it!  Well, I'm off to eat supper and watch tv all night (Friend's finale & Survivor 2nd to last episode).  Night!

Other than the annoying show off little kid, it was awesome!  I can't wait until my next class ...  I suppose that tomorrow morning, when my muscles are aching, I am going to be whining "I hate Karate ... What was I thinking" but right now I am feeling exhilarated!  Well, I'm off to wash my absolutely filthy feet and hit the hay!  Night ...

      Today, I had the smelliest customer ever.  It was in the high 20's today and even hotter in my store (air conditioner got turned on, so we all had to suffer with doors shut ... and it takes at least 24hrs to work properly).  This guy was wearing a winter jacket & snowpants.  He is crazy.  He stunk so bad that I had to keep turning my head to gulp in fresh air.  He reaked like horse shit, hay, BO and bad breath.  To make matters worse, he kept wanting to ask me 50 quadrillion questions like  "Do you have any pens to fit this refill?"  Who the hell shops for a refill first and  then  a pen???  That's like buying an air filter and then going and buying a car based on that air filter.  It's plain retarded!  I don't care if you bought that back in 1830, we don't have it.  I have already told you that 3 times, don't rephrase the question and expect to get a different answer!  And he kept asking me what the ink was  made of .  It's ink.  It writes.  Who gives a rats ass what it is made of.  Just buy a stupid pen and leave!  Gawd!  Anyways, after being nasally assaulted for almost 20 minutes, he leaves the store having bought NOTHING and says how he'll be back and that the next time he comes in someone will have to  "help"  him again.  Lord help us all ... I almost yelled  "Have you every heard of something called soap?  How about deoderant?  Next time wash before you come in you dirty *&^%$#@!"  but I controlled myself.  How was your Monday???

      Today's  DRIVING FOR MORONS  lesson is:   Are You A Menace?    Do you drive a motorhome?  Do you drive a piece of junk vehicle that isn't capable of going any faster than 60 km/h?  Are you so old or blind that you have trouble seeing over the steering wheel?  Are you so stupid that you cannot understand the basics of driving?   If you answered yes to one or more of those questions, then  YOU ARE A MENACE ON THE ROAD!    First, are you the motorhome driver? You are BIG and you are SLOW! You should only be allowed on the road between midnight and 4 am. You should have to pull over everytime there is a vehicle behind you, and let them go by. You hold up traffic and are generally obnoxious.  GET OUT OF MY WAY!    Do you drive the piece of junk that can't go any faster than 60 km/h? You vehicle should be donated to a charity that can raise money by having one of those 'pay "x" amount of dollars to smash this vehicle with a sledgehammer' fundraisers. Then, as punishment, you should have to give me your driver's license so I can stomp on it and then set it on fire.  GET OFF THE ROAD!    Are you old or blind?  HELLO! YOU CAN'T SEE WHY THE HELL ARE YOU DRIVING? USE YOUR BRAIN MORON!  And if you are too senile to use your own brain, hopefully someone who isn't will take away your license and sell your car. Shouldn't you be in a home or something?   Lastly, are you the stupid one? You are too stupid to drive. Since teleportation has yet to be invented, you must walk, bus or hitchhike. You do not deserve to have a driver's license and should have to get a big "S" tattooed on your forehead so that no one ever gives you one by mistake.   If you answered yes to more than one of the questions, you should be tied to the road and run over repeatedly. You are not only a menace to the road, but also a menace to society.  IF YOU ARE A MENACE, STAY OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT!   Did you find this lesson helpful?

      So, I have added a new link (scroll down, look right) to the Anaphylaxis Canada site.  It is a really cool site full of some great educational information.  Being that I have a severe allergy to tree nuts, this kind of info is useful to me and of course I want to pass it on so that others can be educated to.  It still amazes me how ignorant some ppl can be when it comes to severe allergies.  For example, everyone I work with is aware of my allergy to tree nuts.  So we have a food day (everyone brings something to share).  What does one of my coworkers do?  They bring a bowl of mixed nuts and put it on the table.  Therefore I can eat nothing - including the food i brought - because of cross contamination.  All I need is for some dumbass to put their hand in the nut bowl and then touch a veggie stick or something.  (Note: not everyone I work with is this ignorant, it's just an example)  Needless to say, I try to educate ppl.  So, enough ranting!  Check out the website   urlLink HERE

      Have you ever had a run-in with someone who you thought was your friend?  Well, I had one on Friday.  I ran into someone who I thought was my friend and asked them how they were doing.  I had called this person a bit ago and not gotten a call back so I asked why.  What do I get?  A snooty "Yeah, well" reply.  It really hurt, especially considering this person is supposed to be my friend.  They could have said "Oh I never got your message" (which I  know  is what happened) or "I'm sorry, I just haven't had a chance to call you back".  I should have said something, but instead I walked away feeling extremely hurt and sad that a friendship is obviously over.  Day off today ... got my hair cut again.  Doing chores, gotta grocery shop and am planning on voting sometime in there too before going to Karate tonight.  I still don't know who I'm going to put an X beside.  I don't really like any of them.  Oh well, what can you do.  Pick the lesser evil I suppose.  Anyways, I'm off to wash the dishes soaking in the sink (blegh!).  Have a good week.  Ciao.

      Haven't written much this last week, but it was a full one!  Karate Monday - boy was I feeling pretty frustrated after that class.  Went for a walk with Sandbox Tuesday night.  Weds was ultra nutso - work for 9 hours, then karate.  Went to a golf/dinner wind up last night, for the Relay Committee and I'm going out again tonight.  All that and trying to do some packing also.  PHEW!  Karate class was fun on Weds, we got to take turns being the 'good' and 'bad' guys as a way to help learn our 1st kata better.  It was a really good learning excercise cause it helps you visualize why you are making the move you are making and what that move accomplishes.  One good giggle from that class ... one of the moves in our kata is a groin punch.  Well, I guess my reaction to receiving one wasn't quite what the instructor was hoping for and I kinda drew a blank on the whole "groin" thing.  I had to remind him of the fact that I am not a male and a "groin" hit just doesn't make me think the same way as a guy would!  Poor guy.  Needless to say, he advised me to think of it as a hit to the lower abdomen.  It's like a little light went off in my head ... Damn!  That would really hurt :)  I had an absolute blast golfing last night!  I have only ever golfed once before and I was prolly around 10 or so at the time.  I managed to borrow a set of clubs and scrounge up enough for a pair of shoes that were actually golf appropriate (I own lots of sandals).  We did a scramble with the committee split into 3 teams.  Luckily, the teams were made up with a variety of golfers (expert to beginner).  The poor guy on our team who was an expert really had his work cut out with 2 beginners!  I had no idea what club to use when and I asked him at every shot.  LOL, luckily he was pretty patient.  I am very good at swinging and not hitting anything (it was a practise shot, I swear!).  One of the highlights of the evening was a 200 yard drive off the 6th or 7th hole.  It was beautiful!  The ball sailed low and straight.  It was funny, cause there was a bit of a backlog on the course (party of dumb drunken men) and the group behind us (not from our committee, just other golfers) caught up and were watching.  I said to them, "you can't watch, turn around".  Two of them did, it was funny.  Well, when I made this drive, I started whooping and cheering (my teammates too) and these 4 guys were cheering too!  We finished off with dinner in the clubhouse and some great silly conversation.  Anyways, it was a blast.  I won't make fun of golfers anymore.  Well, I should get off here as I have a bunch of errands to run and some chores to do before I go out tonight.  Hope you are having a good weekend.  And Sissy if you are reading this (from the library) hang in there and I'll talk to you the minute your phone gets turned on!  And SIL, I hope things are going smoothly!  Ciao all ;)

      Well, I didn't get a whole lot done this weekend ... it wouldn't have been that bad, except I had the worse insomnia.  Saturday I didn't manage to fall asleep until 5am.  I finally felt like I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore and I had the silliest thing happen to me.  I suppose the fact that it was 5am and I was tired must have had something to do with it ... but I couldn't figure out why there was light coming in the window on my door.  I was thinking that maybe I left my outside light on or something ... until I realized that it was because it was light outside.  The birds were even chirping.  YEAH!  Some exciting news at work today ... they finally decided to "let go" the person that they recently hired.  She was completely useless.  The type of person that 'looks busy' but does absolutely nothing.  Thank goodness!  The only crappy part about that is that we have to do the whole training thing all over again - blegh!  Karate was frustrating tonight.  Mondays are always a bit more of a struggle as they are with the higher level class and more fast paced.  I think it didn't help tonight that I am still feeling overtired from not sleeping well all weekend and it was hotter than sin tonight.  Oh well, it will get better with time!  Well, I'm off to have a snack and then hit the hay.  Night!

       YAY ... IT'S FINALLY FRIDAY!!!!!   My work week is finally over and I'm happy.  I think I shall sleep in tomorrow.  I plan on spending the weekend packing up the non-essentials and throwing away the not-needed things.  I know it's not even the end of June yet, and I don't move for a month, but I don't have to many weekends off between now & then.  I'd rather do it now than be panicked at the end.  I definitely don't want a repeat of my last move which was rushed and not much fun at all (bad situation made worse).  Well, I'm starving ... so I'm going to round up some grub for dinner.  Have a good weekend!

      Damn!  I'm geekier than I thought ... Oh well!  I still want to know what Meio scores, cause I bet he is way geekier than me!  Tonight was karate night.  Only myself and one other person in my class tonight.  That is good, in that there is lots of time for one-on-one instruction.  At the same time, it is bad, like when we have to yell "Ke-yah!".  It is much easier to do when lots of others are doing it too, than when there are only 2 of us.  I learned a lot tonight though, so the good out-weighs the bad.  I actually look forward to doing crunches and push-ups and sweating 2x a week now.  Sick, eh!  Oh, funny story ... although I'm jealous that I never thought of this ... at work today, 2 of the girls decided to scare the be-jezuz out of our boss!  One of them crawled inside of a box and the other went and asked him to help move it.  Well, our boss never ever lifts anything heavy because he has a bad back.  So, he says, "What's in it that's so heavy?" (it was a smaller box) and when he lifted the lid the first girl jumped out and scared the crap out of him!!!!  I wish I could have seen it and I'm totally jealous that I didn't come up with it.  I love that I work with people that have the same "shit head" sense of humour that I have!  Well, I need to head to bed as tomorrow is going to be a long one.  We are having customer appreciation tomorrow, which involves me being the "Sample Girl".  I work 9-5:30.  Woo-hoo!  Goodnight.

      Is it Friday yet?????  This week is dragging!  Here's a recap of the excitement ... since I haven't written in a few days:  Went to the grocery store on Sunday night to get some food and when I got to the check out, there was a young man behind me.  Maybe 18 or 19.  He practically throws his item down onto the counter and then stands there making extremely impatient guestures while my stuff is being rung through.  Now what could possibly be that important on a Sunday night????  Why a box of condoms!   (yes I think its great that he was being responsible enough to use them)   Well, I had to try super hard not to giggle at this guy and because I was trying not to, the poor check out guy was trying not too!  It was pretty amusing.  He must have needed them awfully badly though, cause by the time I had walked out the door and unlocked my car to start put the groceries in it, he was peeling out of the parking lot!  Guess he REALLY needed them, now!!  I've gone and checked out the websites of the political parties running in our current election ... I would like to make an 'informed' decision come voting day.  So, on I surfed.  Well, let me tell you, a certain party (and I am not naming them here, cause I don't want to have a political debate with anyone) had a TERRIBLE website.  It is full of "... we plan on doing this and that" but with nothing concrete to back it up.  There was no "... this is how we plan on doing this and that" just empty promises and ideas.  So, being the type of person that I am, I sent them a nice little email pointing this out and asking them what's up.  Haven't heard back yet.  I'm kind of doubting that I will!  I also tuned into the big Leadership "debate" last night.  I put the word "debate" in brackets, because it could hardly be called that.  The moderator was terrible, allowing them to all talk at once.  Very little was actually debated, they just accused eachother of being the evil one.  I'm sorry, I was in debate club when I was younger (yes I know, I'm a geek).  I strongly feel that debating involves listening to your oponents points and then debating those points ... not slinging mud into eachother's faces!  I am really struggling with who I will vote for and the "debate" last night did little to nothing to help me make up my mind.  Yeesh!  This whole voting thing really stinks.  Now I remember why I have refrained in the past.  Now, on another note ... I got an email from my friend Starshollow asking me to take a geek test.  I scored 15.77909% which was slightly higher than she did.  If you would like to take the test, go  urlLink HERE  to see what you score.  I would like to see what my brother gets ... LOL!  Well, I had best go and get ready for work.  Hope you are having a good week ...

      Okay ... I am in a much better frame of mind now.  I have had a few days to calm down!  Here's an update on the whole student loan thingy:  After tossing and turning all night Thursday, I called back to their hotline on Friday morning.  I felt I was calm enough to explain the whole "I wouldn't gain anything from selling my car" thing.  I spoke to a different lady, and according to her (not her exact wording I must add) the person I spoke to on Thursday must have smoked a large sum of crack that day ... I do not  have  to sell my car, they'll just deduct the amount that my car is worth, over $5000, from the money they give me  and  I can appeal that, with the reasoning of selling it wouldn't leave me with any money, once they've made their decision.  ARRGGGG!  I wish that those BASTARDS would get their crap together.  If the lady had told me that on Thursday, I prolly would have been a gazillion times calmer ... BUT NO!  They have to tell me I HAVE to sell my car or I would be turned down for a loan.  I think I sprouted at least 1000 new white hairs because of this!  Needless to say, I am feeling a lot calmer about this.  I just hope that the lady I spoke to Friday was giving me the correct informatoin, since they obviously SUCK!  $5000 is a lot of money to not get, but I suppose I can always cash my RRSP if I get desperate.  Now I have to play the waiting game to see just how much I will get.  Thank you to everyone who listened to me cry/scream/rant about this and for all the support ... I think I may have had a complete nervous breakdown without it!  On a lighter note, I managed to survive my trip to the Okanagan for the most boringest (it's in  MY  dictionary) meeting ever ... I got put up in a motel last night and it sucked!  One good thing is that I got a room all to myself - one of the bonuses about being a snorer.  Some of the downfalls were the stale smoke smell in a "non-smoking" room, the noise of the highway and the 2 spiders.  A daddy long-leg actually crawled across the bed while I was in it.  I slept on the couch ... I stopped in K-Town on my way home and picked up some application forms at a few places I would like to apply at.  I figure I can fill them out now and then take them back next time I go through ... might as well get on that right away.  Well, I'm poopered.  It's been a long couple of days.  I think I shall head to bed now.  Hope you are surviving the weekend.

       WARNING, THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG AND RANTY POST.  THIS POST WILL MOST LIKELY CONTAIN FOUL LANGUAGE.  THIS POST IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.   Today, I found out that the student loan bastards expect me to sell my car to qualify for a student loan.  I bought a brand new car, a year and a half ago.  I needed a vehicle and I was tired of driving pieces of crap that cost me an arm and leg to keep running.  I had to take out a 5 year loan in order to buy this car and I also had to work 3 jobs (and way more that 40 hours a week) for almost a year to make enough money for a down payment.  In other words, I worked my ass off for it ... I don't want to sell my damn car.  If I were to sell my car right now, I would have to pay out my loan with the money from the sale (right, makes sense).  Because of interest, depreciation, yadda yadda, that would leave me with less than $2000.  Now, if I had a beater car (or something worth less than $5000)or I was leasing my car, that would be okay.  Also, if I was disabled that would also change things.  So, the short of it is,  IF  I sell my car I am left with less than $2000 and I can't even buy a new car with that money, because it would come off of the money I would get with a student loan.  So I fucked no matter what.  As I currently see it, my options are:  a) Don't go to school at all.  This would, of course, cost me the hundreds of dollars that I have already spent on registration fees, deposits, transcripts, time off from work to see an academic advisor and to register, etc.  I would then attempt to work my ass off, so I could save enough money to eventually go back to school without a loan.  b) Seek alternative funding such as a personal loan (good f-ing luck).  c) Claim my car on my application and get turned down, because they want me to sell my car.  d) Lie and don't claim my car on my application.  This could possibly work, and they may never be any wiser.  On the other hand, this may not work and then I will get a black mark and never be able to get a student loan again.  Nevermind that I think that lying is wrong.  e) Sign my car over to someone who will "own" my car on paper, while I continue to make the payments and drive it.  Why anyone would want to do this for me, though, is besides me.  f) Cash in my tiny little RRSP and use that to pay for my tuition and books for the first semester ... of course, this means I would most likely have to drop down to 3 courses (at least) and work my ass off (jobwise) to afford to have a place to live/eat/etc. as there would be no money left over for that.  I have no idea what I would do for the winter semester.  I feel like I am being punished for wanting to go back to school and not being wealthy enough to pay for it all on my own.  I think it is ridiculous that they think I should sell my car for the pitance of an amount that I will end up with and yet someone who owns a $5000 vehicle is fine ... I wouldn't even end up with that much.  I think it's ridiculous that if I was disabled, that would be different.  Do I have to cut off my f-ing leg????  Is that what it takes?   Of course, then I couldn't drive my car (a standard) so that wouldn't make much sense   The thing that pisses me off the most is that this is a loan ... I have to pay back the money I borrow anyways.  All I have to say is WHAT THE FUCK government.  What kind of drugs were you snorting the day you dreamed this one up?  Get a grip!  Well, that's my rant for tonight.  I am going to bed now, as I'm emotionally drained and crazy stressed over all of this.  I was so excited about going back to school ... I've been wanting to do this for a long time.  Now I feel like I've hit a gazillion mile high brick wall and I can't see around it.  I don't know what the hell I'm going to do about all of this.  Anyways, have a good weekend.  I'm off to the Okanagan for a meeting.  Ciao.

      Well, I finished registering!  It was actually surprisingly simple ... other than the frustration of their clock and my clock not being on the same time (and a little bit of impatience on my part).  After sleeping on it last night, I finally decided that 4 courses per semester is a good starting point.  I haven't been in school in about 6 years and I don't want to flunk out cause I overloaded myself.  In case you are curious, this is what I'll be taking:   FALL  Indigineous Studies: Concepts & Frameworks Psychology: Personal Functions Sociology: Intro 1 Social Work: Intro to Social Work Practice   WINTER  Anthropology: Intro to Cultural Anthropology Indigineous Studies: Okanagan Concepts & Frameworks Sociology: Intro 2 Social Work: Inro to Social Welfare in Canada  I am waitlisted on only one course, but I am the first person on the waitlist and I can take it at a less convenient time if need be.  As it is, I only go to school Monday to Thursday both semesters and my earliest (only early am) class is 8:30 on Thursdays.  I only have 1 class on Tuesdays and I am done by 5 each day.  So, all-in-all I think I have a pretty good schedule and I am excited about the courses I registered for.  The student loan application is retarded!  Some of the questions are so dumb ... for example, how much money will you be making while you attend school?  I have no freakin' clue!  I don't have a job yet ... couldn't tell you!  Yeesh.  Oh well.  That is all I have left to wait on, is whether or not I get a student loan.  I can't see any reason why I wouldn't, but you never know with our gov't.  Anyways, I'm off to enjoy the rest of my day.  Ciao!

      Don't you hate it when you forget things????  I had this really cool tune running through my head last night before I went to bed ... it was this sultry kind of really nice tune.  Catchy.  When I woke up this morning, it was gone and I still have no clue what I hummed (for hours).  Damn!  Tomorrow I register for my classes ... Hopefully it will go smoothly, as I'm doing it online and I've been told that their system isn't always the most reliable.  I'm still waffling on how many courses I'm going to take per semester.  I guess it all depends on if any of the classes I want are full, etc.  I won't make my final decision, prolly, until the last minute.  Maybe sleeping on it for one more night will help me make up my mind.  Well, I'm starving!  So I should prolly think about cooking something up for supper.  Hope you're all having a great week!  Later ...

      I have the most sultry tune stuck in my head right now ... I just wanted to share!  Oh, I watched a really good foreing film.  It's called Monsieur Batignale.  It's about this French butcher who ends up helping jewish children escape from the Germans.  Quite a good movie.  I've watched it once with the subtitles on and I plan on watching it again with them off.  My thoughts for the night!  Goodnight all.

      I quite think that life is currently zooming by ... I cannot believe it is already June.  So much has happened and is happening right now.  I had my last weekend with my kidlets and soon I will no longer be doing that job at all.  Relay has come and gone.  I have been taking my karate class for a month now.  I register for classes this week, I have to travel to a meeting at the end of the week, and it is less than two months before I move ... it's all happening so fast.  Crazy.  Anyways, that's my thought for the moment.  I have to go to bed now.  Night.

Anyone have any suggestions on how I can fix my comments BTW?&nbsp; I now have 2 sets of comments ... the one I want above and the one I don't want below.&nbsp; ARGGGGHHH!&nbsp; It's making me want to pull my hair out!

      My blog had a facelift this morning ... since I will be moving, my website will be going down.&nbsp; I had been hosting my pics and my blogskin off of my website, so I needed to make a change so that I wasn't left with broken links and x's all over the place.&nbsp; Moving day is coming ever so close and today is my last day of work.&nbsp; CRAZY!&nbsp; Anyways, just a quick post ... gotta finish getting ready for work.&nbsp; Have a good day!   For some crazy reason, my comments are appearing ABOVE my posts.&nbsp; I hope to have this remedied shortly ... and just for the record, YES MY BLOGSKIN INVOLVES PINK.&nbsp; GET OVER IT!&nbsp; And no, I did not realize that it is the same as the Ma's until after I did it, and now you are stuck with it until after the move!&nbsp; HA!

      Well, I just arrived home from karate class ... Tonight was my last class, but also a totally kick ass class!&nbsp; I did 195 push ups (girl ones) and over 500 crunches.&nbsp; I also fell without fear!!!!!!!&nbsp; And I got a compliment from the Sensei about my sparring tonight!&nbsp; I am going to really miss my class, I have learned tons, gained confidence&nbsp;and it has been really good for me.&nbsp; Got 3 really good recommendations for places to continue studying in Ktown.&nbsp; It was especially nice that my class ended for me on a high note.   Had a good weekend ... went off to the US to visit with an old friend.&nbsp; It was really nice to see him, since it had been too long since the last time.&nbsp; A nice visit though, even though his dog ate my shoes!&nbsp; It was fun going to Wally World in my slippers to get a new pair.&nbsp; Wish our visit could have been longer :(&nbsp; At least he's still not going to be that far away, even after the move.   Drive home was absolutely brutal ... DEER EVERY FREAKIN' WHERE!&nbsp; Almost had a run in with a kamikaze Bambi which was pretty scary.&nbsp; But, managed to arrive home safe and sound.&nbsp; Well, I am tired out and I need to have a shower before bed.&nbsp; So much for getting some more packing done tonight!&nbsp; Have a good week ...

      Well, I finally have my first official karate injury ... I don't know what I did last night, but it seems I have pulled the muscle in the back of one upper leg.&nbsp; Kinda hurts a bit, although I'm sure I'll manage with only a bit of a limp.&nbsp; As long as it's better for class tomorrow night and I can work it's all good :)~&nbsp; Took a pretty decent knock on the side of the head last night too ... mine own fault for not having my hand blocking or reacting quick enough.&nbsp; Kinda funny actually!&nbsp; I guess I must be getting to a better level that something like that doesn't phase me anymore.&nbsp; Just roll with it ... I even fell 3 times without almost crapping my pants :) &nbsp; I am sooooooo sick of packing ... in fact, after this move if I never see a damn box again I will be happy!&nbsp; I think I am getting a twinge of excitement though.&nbsp; It's all mingled with the twinges of nostalgia and nervousness.&nbsp; That and stress of getting everything done!&nbsp; Well, I should think about getting ready for work, instead of being a slug in front of the computer ... that and my tea is finished.&nbsp; Have a good day!

      Here's my mid-week update ... LOL.  Cause I am soooo important that I need a mid-week update!  My retirement dinner was wonderful.  Lots of fun stories and conversations.  I got to sit with my two favourite coworkers.  I got a really cool photo album with candid pics of all my coworkers and some hilarious captions.  Also, I got some cute ladybug stuff and a gift certificate to buy some school supplies.  Evening ended on a happy note, no one cried and that is exactly what I wanted.  Just over 2 weeks left of work and I know that there will be enough tears at the end.  Meio, Squiggles and I have officially found a place to live.  It is a 3 bedroom with 2 bathrooms and eventhough I haven't seen it yet, it sounds super nice!  Plus, the rent is just right!  It's in a good location and a nice neighbourhood.  I was starting to get nervous,  so I'm glad that's taken care of.  Now I just have to worry about finishing packing and how many thousands of trips its going to take to move my stuff.  Gotta do a dump run between now and then to get rid of my 2 desks and my couch which I refuse to move.  Karate class tonight was HELL!  My Sensai was in a super evil mood tonight and worked us hard for the whole 2 1/2 hours.  NO BREAKS!  We did 210 crunches, 65 push ups and at least 1000 kicks.  Of course, that was all ON TOP of the regular stuff.  I don't know if I will be able to walk tomorrow morning.  So, if you don't hear from me for a few days, it is because I am lying in the middle of my apartment unable to move.  LOL.  I get to visit with my niece & nephew one more time tomorrow before they leave ... I can't wait to see them, but I don't want to say bye to them again either.  It is hard not still living in the same community as them.  I'm hoping I can get that way sometime in August.  Of course, it depends on how quickly I get a job and how well my savings lasts.  Anyways, I need to do a quick tidy up because someone is viewing my apartment tomorrow while I am at work.  I seriously hate the idea of someone looking at my stuff!  Of course, a lot of my stuff is in boxes already ... but still!  A disturbing thought.  Have a good remainder of the week.  I'll give you the whole week recap this weekend (you know, cause I am soooo important)!

      I am covered with mosquito bites from the lake the other day.  Yesterday, they weren't that bad, but today they are driving me bananas!!!!  I have them on my feet, on my back and EVEN IN MY HAIR!  They are sooooooo itchy.  I woke up at 5am this morning cause my damn foot was itchy and then I couldn't get back to sleep.  Crazy thing is that I was absolutely COATED with bug spray (avec deet) all day, reapplied several times and yet I still managed to get at least 15 good sized bites.  Damn mosquitos!    PS .... I added a new link on my fave blogs list.  Check out "Your Right Hand Thief".  It's a well-written blog and has some pretty funny stuff on it!

      I spent the most amazing day at the lake yesterday with my older nephew and my neice.  We spent hours exploring and poking at things.  We found this most revolting creature:   It was the biggest, ugliest leech I have ever seen in my whole life!  The kids caught it in their bucket and brought it back to the campsite to scare the crap out of their grandmother!  She was thouroughly disgusted.  All-in-all it was a really fun day with them!  Anyways, I'm off to the laundromat now and then I have to get ready for my retirement dinner tonight (LOL).  Have a good week!

      My friend, who just happens to belong to the Canadian military, sent me this article and I have decided to share it.  I think it is absolutely disgusting that all this guy got was a slap on the wrist and then he is suing because of it.  Confused?  Read on:   INDEPTH: FRIENDLY FIRE Friendly fire case: the legal saga CBC News Online | July 6, 2004   U.S. Air Force Major Harry Schmidt, one of the pilots involved in the "friendly fire" incident that killed four Canadians in Afghanistan was found guilty of dereliction of duty on July 6, 2004. He was reprimanded and forfeited more than $5,000 U. S. in pay. The air force agreed to allow Schmidt to remain in the Illinois Air National Guard, but not as a pilot.   Major Schmidt made a deal in June 2004 so he could face a non-judicial hearing on the charges. The maximum penalty he had faced was 30 days of house arrest.   Legal wrangling delayed the case again and again. In late March 2004, the U.S. Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals refused to supply classified information to Schmidt's legal team. The ruling also prohibited Schmidt from discussing anything that could be classified with his lawyer, Charles Gittins.  In a statement released by Gittins in the summer of 2003, Schmidt said: "It is clear that I cannot and will not receive a full and fair hearing" in a non-judicial proceeding which is heard by a senior U. S. Air Force officer.  Schmidt faced two counts of dereliction of duty for not making sure he was dropping a bomb on the enemy and for disobeying air controllers' instructions to "standby" while information was verified. The formal counts allege that he "failed to comply with the applicable rules of engagement" and "willfully failed to exercise appropriate flight discipline over his aircraft."   Schmidt was originally charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter and eight counts of assault. Schmidt's wingman, Maj. William Umbach was originally charged with four counts of aiding and abetting manslaughter, and eight counts of aiding and abetting assault.  Umbach agreed to accept a reprimand and retire from the Air Force.  When it decided to proceed with the dereliction of duty charges on June 30, 2003, the Air Force dropped the original charges of involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault against Schmidt.   On June 19, 2003, Lt. Gen. Bruce Carlson, commander of the U.S. 8th Air Force, who reviewed the case, decided that both pilots should receive non-judicial punishment. That meant the Air Force had decided not to court martial the two National Guard pilots who were charged in the incident outside Kandahar, Afghanistan on April 18, 2002. As well as the four Canadian soldiers who were killed, eight others were wounded when Schmidt dropped a 250-kilogram laser-guided bomb from his F-16 on the night-time live-fire military exercise.   Schmidt maintains he was not briefed on the Canadian exercise before the flight. He says he was told in the briefing that the Taliban was active in the area.  The ruling came after an Air Force "Article 32" hearing – the equivalent of a preliminary hearing in Canada – was held at Barksdale Air Force Base near Bossier, La., in January 2003.   If Schmidt had faced the manslaughter charges, he could have received up to 64 years in prison. The dereliction of duty charge means Schmidt could face up to six months in jail.   The accident sent Canadians into mourning. Nearly two weeks later, the official mourning came to an end with an emotional memorial service in Edmonton.   Of the eight Canadian soldiers injured in the bombing, six returned to Canada the following week. The two others were treated for minor injuries and remained with their unit in Afghanistan. The unit, the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, has since returned to Canada.   (used without permission)    U.S. 'friendly fire' pilot suing air force  Last Updated Thu, 08 Jul 2004 16:36:20     NEW ORLEANS - A U.S. fighter pilot appealing a dereliction of duty verdict in an accidental bombing that killed four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan is also suing the Air Force.   Charles Gittins, the lawyer for Maj. Harry Schmidt, said the lawsuit will seek damages because the air force released documents to the public about the case.   On Tuesday, Schmidt was given a letter of reprimand and ordered to forfeit $5,600 US in pay. Gittins said the unprecedented release of the letter of reprimand to the media was a violation of Schmidt's privacy.   "The air force, in releasing the letter of reprimand, violated Maj. Schmidt's right to privacy protected under the Privacy Act of 1974," Gittins said.   "We believe that their conduct was intentional and malicious and we intend to seek redress. Maj. Schmidt is entitled to money damages, including his attorney's fees, for the violation of his privacy rights."   Gittins comments come a day after he said his client plans to appeal the dereliction of duty conviction.   In the reprimand, Lt.-Gen. Bruce Carlson slammed Schmidt's conduct, saying he "acted shamefully … exhibiting arrogance and a lack of flight discipline."   "The victims of your callous misbehaviour were from one of our staunch allies in Operation Enduring Freedom and were your comrades-in-arms," he wrote.   Schmidt was one of two National Guard pilots who dropped bombs during a nighttime, live-fire military exercise near Kandahar on an April 2002 mission.   The four soldiers were the first Canadians killed in combat since the Korean War. Eight others were wounded.   Schmidt maintains he was not briefed on the Canadian exercise before the flight. He says he was told in the briefing that Taliban fighters were active in the area.    (used without permission)   Is anyone else completely disgusted by this?????????

      Well, I'm finally not the newest member of my karate class!  We had 2 new people join tonight.  It felt really good to not be at the bottom of the food chain for once!  It was a good class though ... I'm finally starting to get more comfy with take downs (falling).  Anyways, not much to say tonight ... hope you are having a good week!  Ciao.

      Tonight for supper I made the yummiest dish!  Brown jasmine rice served with a super yummy red chili curry on top.  MMMMM!  Tofu and tons of veggies.  Red chili spice and light coconut milk.  It was soooooo good!  Killer spicy just the way I like.  I have lots of left-overs too.  YUMMMMM!  Karate class was interesting tonight ... for the summer session, our class is being joined by another group who practise a similar, but different style of karate.  Yeesh!  They do things slightly different.  For example, when they attack, they just PLOW right on through, where as when we are practising we stop.  Also, they grab and hold, where as we don't.  Needless to say, you can imagine my shock when a 6'4" 300lb man came charging at me!  I almost crapped my pants ... okay, maybe not - but it was nerving.  Also, I almost landed on my ass when I did a front kick and the same bugger grabbed and held.  Interesting class and it should be a good learning experience.  At least I was able to keep up, because the instructor went slower for the other class.  YAY!  Well, I'm off to bed ... have to work tomorrow.  Night!

      So, as I've prolly mentioned, I'm moving at the end of July.  So, we are doing this whole house-hunting thing.  I got my first dissappointment today ... It was a really nice place too.  Hardwood floors, a dishwasher, nice location, decent rent.  They decided to rent to someone else and I feel pretty dissappointed about it.  I know it's early in the month, but I would just rather find a place and have everything set to go.  I don't want to be scrambling at the last minute ... and I know squiggles and meio prolly feel the same way.  Keep your fingers crossed for us!  I'm so excited, the two older kidlets are coming to town today!  They will be staying with their grandma, I think for about a week.  I am looking forward to seeing them and possibly borrowing them for a night or so!  I wish Sissy and Matty-pants were coming too :(  Cruddy thing about moving is that I am saving every single penny I can for that ... I'd rather be prepared in case I don't get a job right away.  BLEGH!  That means no travelling for me this summer.  Well, I'm off to do some tidying and maybe pack a box or something.  Have a good week!

      I hate job hunting.  It is time consuming, annoying and frankly a pain in the ass.  I think no one should have to go through it.  There!  That's my 2 cents for today.

      Had a nice day today ... got up early and toodled off to church.  It was nice, cause I got to have a short visit with the lady who used to be the priest at my church back home.  Was feeling a bit homesick, so it was nice to see a familiar face from back home.  After church I went for a drive down the valley and had a long visit with my Grams ... the last few times I have gone, I have managed to catch her near nap time and not gotten much of a visit.  So today, I stayed for over 2 hours.  We sat outside and she talked about her childhood (where her mind is currently situated) and then we played Rummy.  Of course, she cheated as she always has.  How can you call an old lady on cheating?!?  It is funny more than anything ... if she didn't like the hand she had, she would just discard all of her cards and take new ones.  Or she would go, even if it wasn't her turn, several times in a row.  At one point, I reached into her hand to help her out and she smacked my hand away.  Fiesty old broad!  After visiting with Grams, I went to visit an old childhood friend and his family (wife & 2 kids).  It was really nice to sit around BSing and to play with the 2 boys.  Very cute little boys ... rambunctious and fun.  I got to be the "Tickle Monster".  Kids laughter is good for the soul.  It was neat to drive through the valley, since I grew up in that area.  So much has changed and grown since I was a kid.  Everything is so much bigger!  Well, it's getting late and I should hit the hay.  I'm going to start job-hunting tomorrow.  Wish me luck!

      I thought I had some interesting post to write, but now that I sit down to write ... a blank mind.  Maybe it's cause I'm tired and haven't been able to get into a sleep schedule yet.  I dunno!  Anyways, hope you are having an exciting weekend.  Ciao!

      Today we all did a bit more unpacking and setting of stuff up in the living room ... starting to look like home now!  I worked a bit on my resume today.  YUCK!  I hate job hunting.  I especially hate filling out application forms.  BLEGH!  My sleep schedule is all mixed up.  Last 2 nights I've been up super late and it's looking like tonight will be the same.  Oh well ... It will sort out in a few more days or so.  Well, I'm off to putter and put dinner away.  Ciao!

      Well, I am here ... And in the process of getting unpacked. These last few days without internet have been hell!  I was having withdrawal symptoms big time.  Tonight Meio hooked me up with hi-speed and some more ram on my puter.  Wowzers is it ever fast!  Meio rocks!  New place is a beaut.  Nice and big and in a good neighbourhood.  Only complaint I have is that it is too damn noisy here!  After living on a quiet no-thru road for the last 2 years, this is super loud for me.  I don't think the traffic ever stops here ...  I'm hoping to begin the job hunt on Friday.  I have to update my resume tomorrow (oh joy) and finish filling out some applications that I picked up already.  Seems to be a few places that I have been in the last few days are hiring, so I don't think finding a job should be too difficult.  Went looking at cell phones today.  Anyone out there ever used Bell?  I'm thinking about signing on with them.  Telus is a definite no go, I'm not happy with their offerings.  Rogers is a maybe, although it seems that Bell has better plans.  I dunno.  Gonna do some research online and go from there.  I now only have one comment section again, but still at the top of my posts.  Hmmm, maybe tomorrow I can tinker and figure it out.  Alright, it is late and I am starting to see cross-eyed.  So, it's off to bed with me!  Goodnight and I'll blog again soon!
