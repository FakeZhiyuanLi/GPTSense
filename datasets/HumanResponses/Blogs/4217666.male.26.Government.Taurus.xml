       urlLink FOXNews.com - U.S. &amp; World - Calif. Court Voids Gay Nuptial Licenses    Thursday, August 12, 2004    SAN FRANCISCO Â— The California Supreme Court ruled unanimously Thursday that San Francisco's mayor overstepped his authority by issuing same-sex marriage licenses this spring. The court also voided all the marriages of gay and lesbian couples sanctioned by the city.    urlLink Click here to see the courts ruling   Wow, its about time something in California has gone right. The ultra-liberal State who is always the pioneer in liberalizing America has finally done something right. I agree that the mayor of San Francisco overstepped his bounds. He had no right to do that under current State law, in fact he should be considered a criminal. He broke the law. Somehow I don't think he'll be brought to criminal court over this. At the least, they should remove him from office.  California, the state who has the toughest gun ownership laws in the nation, the state who wants to rule the the phrase "under God" is unconstitutional, and the same state who lobbies for the liberals in Washington, because they are mostly liberal, has done something conservative. Praise God! Hopefully any appeals process is put down too.

       This is my warning to you the reader. I may publish things on this site that may upset you, may you think or even get you mad at me. Either way I don't care. I love controversy and I like to stir it up. I am not politically correct, and I cannot stand people who are. If you think you can't handle it, find another Blog to read.  With that said I cannot &amp; will not be held responsible for anything I post.

       Well I am new to this realm of the Internet. I've seen it on TechTV's The Screensavers and once in a while on news programs I'll hear something about it. Today I noticed it on my Google Toolbar and just pressed it, which led me here.  While I am quite computer savvy and Internet savvy; I am not too savvy with posting my thoughts in this manner. The only other experience I have is on The History channels discussion boards on religious history. I really enjoy debating with people there over many different topics from the Bible and God's Word to politics.  I guess that will be all for now while I continue to explore this new Blog thing.

       urlLink Telegraph Money Oil price hits new high on fears for Iraq supply   I just have one simple question. Why do we (The United States) buy oil from all these Arab nations and sell our own oil from Alaska? There is something fundamentally wrong with this. At its simplest equation, we should stop purchasing foreign oil and start using the oil we pump for ourselves; if there is any left over we can sell that too. I'm certainly not an economist but I would like to think that we could save a considerable amount of money at our pumps if we did this.
