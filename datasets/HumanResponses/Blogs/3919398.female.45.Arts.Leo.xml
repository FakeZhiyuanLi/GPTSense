      Fourteen months....that's how long he'd been sober. We've been married ten years. You do the math.  I remember being devastated the night I cornered him by the front door. He was trying to leave...to escape...again. "Have you compromised your sobriety? Is it over? Have you been drinking?" Choose a question...any one...just tell me I'm wrong. I wasn't. He'd been drinking for months. My fault. Naturally.  Well, it's been two years since then and I'm still on the same roller coaster. It's funny, isn't it? He has the disease and I'm the one seeing a shrink. Is it helping? I don't know...it's a place to put the poison I guess. Maybe...hopefully...this is another place. A place without a face...I need that...desperately.  It's funny how these illnesses of the Head Zone work, don't you think? His is called 'alcoholism'...mine is labeled 'clinical depression'.  Seems if there's a name, then there's a pill...or a program...or a 'facility'. Politics and bureaucracy...black and white...good and bad...normal and 'sick'. It's all part of our fundamental rights as human beings, right? Freedom? Pick your category...pick up your ball and drop it onto the maze of confusion...watch it bump and teeter over a grid of nails...where she stops, nobody knows...nor do they care.  It's not like I didn't see the red flags. They waved big, bright and furious right from the start. He called and asked me to a movie...THEN he asked what I look like. "I don't normally date girls over 120 pounds...but we can still be friends." Tell me...what does a 'healthy' mind do with that? I told him there was no need to check the papers for movie show times and to have a nice life. He apologized for hurting my feelings and insisted I let him buy me dinner "to make it up to me" Six months later he was moving in...and six months after that, he was still moving in. Red flag number two.   I can't say I didn't see the potential. His home was a modest little place...one could even say quaint. But the building, and whatever charm that managed to peek through, it wasn't Mike. No, Mike was perspicuous in the parlor furnished with nothing but a broken tv, a sleeping bag and a fish tank so murky you wondered how anything could possibly live in it. Mike could...and did. The sleeping bag was indeed the only bedding in the house. The kitchen table was defined only by the rectangular elevation in clutter that literally carpeted each room. Days and weeks worth of insalubrious meals that had affixed themselves to countertops as though clinging on for dear life. In fact he held onto that place as if it WERE his life...like it was some sort of security blanket "just in case". Perhaps he saw a red flag as well.

      Why is it that we always seem to ignore the biggest flags of all? The ones that wave frantically from the very top of the flag pole? The ones that flash like beacons in frenzied thrashes and pummeling rage? We'd only been married a few months...newlyweds, in fact. We should have been on top of the world. But the rosy glow of a love struck groom soon gave way to the inebriated suffusion of a drunk.  It was midnight when I got home from work. As much as it disgusted me, I was not surprised by the empty house. It had been happening more and more frequently in the weeks following our wedding. By now it was customary for him to stagger in at two or three in the morning. But as the clock saw 4:00 and 5:00 come and go, my anger dissipated as I became more and more concerned. I made phone calls to family, friends, police and hospitals....and I worried. By 9:00 am I was frantic. I had spent the night pacing the floor, wondering if Mike had finally become another statistic. I was beyond angry...beyond hurt...beyond tears. I was in full blown panic when the police called at 9:30 to say they'd found Mike at the home of his brother, Matt...the only sibling I did not have a phone number for. Matt was also an active alcoholic...and didn't have a phone...go figure.  It was just after 11:00 am when Mike came strolling in. He wore his self righteous arrogance like a badge as he staggered into the parlor. Brushing past me, as though he'd just returned from a grueling day at the office, he stumbled to the sofa and sprawled out like a cat after a savory feast. I was livid.  How does this happen? I consider myself a reasonably intelligent woman. When did I become so naive? We had dated for nearly a year before we decided to get married. How on earth did he manage to keep this secret? How did I not know? There must be something wrong with me.  "I waited up all night for you....I was afraid something terrible had happened." His face contorted into a superfluous array of indignant expression, finally settling on a most self righteous smirk. "I didn't do nuthin' wrong". Nothing wrong? Funny, I couldn't seem to think of one thing that had been right with the last 12 hours or so.   I had worked an eight hour shift the evening before. The ride home found me tired and so looking forward to curling up with my new husband and relaxing the days stressors away. No such luck. I was physically and emotionally exhausted and, in a few hours, I had to leave for work again. "Nothing wrong? I was worried sick about you! Would it have killed you to let me know where you were?...that you weren't coming home? I called the police....I called hospitals....." He laughed. I could feel myself spinning out of control. My pulse raced and shook my entire body. I was furious. Still laughing, he pointed his finger in my face. "Look at you...you're pathetic!" Oh how right he was! I truly was pathetic. I began to recount for him what had been a hellish night for me. And with absolute disregard, he picked up a puzzle book from the coffee table and proceeded to find-a-word. I could feel myself snap. It may have even made an audible sound as every last shred of my sanity seemed to unravel like a movie projector unravels a film when it slips it's track. I saw red...and I wanted him to see it, too. I grabbed the puzzle book from him and before I was able to discern a cognitive thought, his smirk was being abruptly introduced to the back of my hand. Hard. The reality of that moment hit me hard as well. I wasn't holding all the cards anymore. I had screwed up. I had been abused...and now I was abusing. I wanted to die. Mike just sat there, stunned, holding his face. He pulled off his wedding ring and threw it across the room.
