      Ok, so, Allie's pirate reminded me of this crazy crazy happening on sunday.  I shall tell the story:  Katie Davis and I were sailing in her JY-15.  We were cruising on a reach with 20mph winds and huge rolling waves, and we were girl-talking and having a blast.  A huge sailboat is headed on collision course with us.  We, however, were the leeward boat (futher from the wind), meaning that we had the right of way.  We're crazy fuckers so we took this dude on.  We get a little closer and I say, "Holy shit, there's a pirate flag".  Katie screams, "Why the hell would they be flying that?" I say, "well I heard there really are pirates around here.  Katie answers, "You fuckhead, I told you that.  Feeling humiliated, I say, "Oh well they'll move." He didn't move! We had to change our course and these crazy pirate dudes looked behind and were like, "woah there's a boat."  Ok, they didn't board our boat and steal our shit (which would be like katie's expensive breast impants and my golden fillings).  No I'm kidding, we have neither of these.  In other words, there was nothing on our boat.  They didn't come after us.  Crap, my story sucked.  Today I made friends with this guy, Mark, in Driver's Ed.  I also told Molly about the girl on the train who told me all about her sex toys boutique and invited me to a party.  I said sex toys and the blond bitches turned around.  It was hilarious.

      So, tonight I experienced the joys of elementary school.  It was the first of three review days in Driver's Ed.  I sat with Molly Ward behind the three skinny, pretty, snobby girls, and we went around the room answering questions and explaining them.  It was my turn:  Me: When is the road most slippery? At the beginning of the rainfall because oils on the road will rise up and can become very slippery, but after the rain's been falling for a while those oils will usually disperse.  Blond Bitch to Brown Bitch (with sexy piercings, but that's besides the point): "What the fuck" Brown B to Blond B: "She goes to Loomis Chaffee." All three: *giggle uncontrollably* Me: Excuse me? Them: Um, we were saying that you're smart. Me: Yea, thanks a lot *cough, sneeze* Them: Giggle some more because they are OH SO FUNNY.  Well, I took much pride out of this.  I realize that I like myself.  I decided that they are doomed to unhappy lives with hot guys who are dicks and money that covers up for all their ditzyness, and they won't know right from left.  Oh how nice it is to wear baggy shorts, a beatles shirt, a bandana, rainbow bracelet, and 6 rings.  I'm a fighter. Grrrrrrrr.  You girls are goin down down down! Three more days left! Take this!  This means WAR! just kidding... I actually just spend all of drivers ed entertaining myself by making fun of them.  The girl with the piercings went to Hebrew school with me haha.  Today, she got ripped for talking.  Rick made her teach the class, and she was supposed to explain to us why you should break in a fast-pumping action rather than just jamming once and holding it down.  We had just gone over this about 5 minutes earlier, and she says "I don't know" in her obnoxious voice, and I was thinking.  Is she putting on an act or is she really this ditzy? And then I was wondering which is worse.  Wow, I'm bad.  BUT DRIVER'S ED IS SO PAINFUL.  I have ever right to reduce myself to a whiney little 5th grader for 2 hours a day.  Survival 101. Thank you.

      Wow, I'm amazed by myself.  I'm being social for the first time in my life! I hung out with jeff yesterday, then jon slept over, went rollerblading with kearny (This little kid asked us to watch his electric scooter and we got to try it! Stupid little kids ROCK MY WORLD!) and now I"m sleeping over at Allie's after drivers ed! I'm so exciited! Social overload is so not me.  THis is funny.  This is weeeird.  She's gonna help me make my blog super cool, so yay yay yay!  Fun fact of the day: (quiz result)    urlLink        You are Magic Mushrooms!  You don't mind taking a little mind trip - even if it leaves you with a ripped up stomach.  You're keen on sitting back and checking out the visuals. Or talking with your cat.

      So, Jon's sleeping in my sister's room.  I woke up so I could take full advantage of my opportunity to copy his cd's.  Now: To wake jon up or not to wake jon up.  That is the question.  This is urgent, people. hehe

      let me know if you have any suggestions Here goes nothing:  I Am More  I try to picture a leaf floating down a swift mountain stream. I imagine myself as that leaf. I imagine the freedom, the ease with which it slides down each rock and then rises to the surface once again. I imagine the jolly nature with which that leaf circles in a pool before being lifted gracefully down the natural stairs of the green mountainside. I close my mouth and close my eyes, and I see my new surroundings in vivid colors. I see green and brown and orange and yellow, and through a lush canopy of green, I spot a blue sky with white fluffy clouds. I taste the freshness of the air unadulterated, and it’s really quite pleasant.  I try to picture a leaf floating down a swift mountain stream, and  I imagine that I, myself, am that leaf, That I, myself, have such a free spirit with which I glide and float. I count to ten and open my eyes, and I only realize that I am torturing myself with false visions. This leaf will never constitute me, and the swift current will not sweep me up. Never will I be so calm, For I am unwieldy with shapes and facets unknown to a simple leaf. Forever will I be weighted with that which the stream can’t carry: endless pathways and indecision. Never will I smell the scent of the mountain air with baggage as light as paper. Please, Doctor, don’t mistake me. I am just a girl, but I possess no limits. I have a heart, and I have hands.

      So I'm sitting here in bed at 1:15 writing depressing poetry like the good ol' days, and it's really quite refreshing.  Crazy Hannah, meet perfecto Hannah.  Enjoy, and no, I don't necessarily feel the way I'm writing.  When I write, I create this atmosphere that makes me feel so connected with my emotions that I usually go overboard.  (overboard.. meaning suicide and utterboredom and end of the worldathons)So, have no fear.  Here she is (unedited): Tock tick, Tock tick I swear time is going backwards these long summer days.  A while back I was a butterfly: I was bright. I was beautiful, lighthearted. With grace I flew everywhere.  Now I’m back in my cacoon, which grows thicker by the day. Tock tick I can’t help but think I could suffocate in here.  It’s tock tick, tock... Till one last satin thread takes me home.  THE END By the way, I had a lot of fun last night.  I enjoyed my rolling job! Thanks guys.  Hope you had fun too.  And Bork and Molly, we make an amazing breakfast! :)

      Wow, it's been a while since I've posted (or not).. but things have been pretty cool.  I'm reading this book about cuba that someone recommended to me.  It just so happens that I'm on page 40, and all I have discovered of any substance are stories of the first time he knew he was gay (at age 6, seeing the vividly described naked men plunge into the river.  Yep, I've been reading about anal sex, penetrating farm animals, and over-obsessive masturbation for the past 5 days.  And thanks Uncle Doug for publicizing this!  No one read Before Night Falls by Renaldo Arenas.  (actually I'm enjoying it)  Soo, wednessday I was in windsor, so I met Melis for ice cream and then went to the coffee shop.  That was pretty cool- People Contact!  Hmmm drivers ed is a blast, staring at pictures of drunk driving victims for 2 hours a night.  If anyone hasn't taken this yet, I'll let you in on a secret: Their real purpose in life is to scare you away from ever driving.  All I've gotten so far is the fear that every time I get in a car theres a 95% chance of dying (I guess I am scared of death afterall)  This weekend all of my family came to my beach house for my mom's 50th bday.  I did some mountain biking, sailng, boating to Watch Hill (the works!), and I'm majorly sunburnt.  Skin cancer, here I come.  Partyin tuesday night! YAY! :) Can't wait.  Ooops, one more concern.  I just went for my yearly physical.  The doctor made me fill out this confidential questionare that had lotsa personal questions like "Do you smoke marijuana, do you smoke ciggarettes, do you ever think of hurting yourself, are you concerned with your body image, do you worry about your parents' relationship, Are you attracted to girls, guys, both or neither". I answered honestly to the whole freakin thing, he looked at it, and threw it away! What the fuck!  I'm lying next time.  And another story.. wow I just can't leave. Oh wait, my mom's making chicken wings. This'll be fast.  And yes, I'm not a vegetarian.  I know, I know, I'm sorry!...... So, last night it was really windy and I discovered that flying kites is fucking awesome.  I got Katie (davis.. her beach house is near mine so I force her into participating in my wild fun)  Sooo, we let this kite's string go out like 500 feet.. I ran away for a second, and her her screaming.  She let it go!!!!! And now it's caught on something, and we can't figure out what.  I think a planes gonna fly into it, or some poor little birdy!!! Oh no!  Hahaha, I went back this morning and it was still there.  I'm soooo fascinated.  I hope it stays forever flying as a tribute to my coolness. (maybe it can replace all those stupid half-masted american flags.... can someone explain this to me? Why should we all mourn and suffer just because some guy, who was a waste of space and who was just like  our G.Dubya.Bush,... just because he died!  (You can correct me because I'm quite ignorant when it comes to old silly presidents.

      Indigo Girls concert the 15th (I think.. it's a monday....) in Northhampton.  Who wants to go?! You know you want to.  You really really want to.  You would kill to spend a few hours with Hannah.  Your hormones so desire this amazing opportunity.  Please, listen to your body.

      For some reason I'm feeling incredibly lonely.  I really need to see people, but it seems like it takes so much effort.  And I don't understand this at all; I normally love being alone, and I can get so much done- read good books, go for hikes, run, draw, write.  My current state is just what Avon does to kids like me, I guess.  Maybe it has to do with having driver's ed every night, and being surrounded by those spoiled snobby girls I used to like, and I can't quite tell if this life or the life I intend to live is reality.  Am I better off, or are they?  They will of course be happy their whole lives.  The will be rich, marry some sexy man, and have beautiful children.  Me?  I'll change the world.  I will feel lonely; I'll have doubts, but I'll be adventurous.  I'll see the world and love the world rather than just one person.  I'll experience life, not avoid it.  I know I'm better off.  I love being me. At driver's ed, I sit against the wall.  I like it there, and I feel confident as I waste away my two hours learning absolutely nothing as everyone plays with their cellphones.  I hiked 30 minutes then walked the rest of the way to the dentist this morning, and I discovered a bunch of new trails.  They were beautiful, with ferns covering everything and this craaazy moss.  I came out in someone's backyard.. really random.  I ran into Evan (went out with him for a while freshman year) at Cosi's today.  That was interesting.

      Today hasn't exactly been what we like to call a "good day".  I'm missing a huuge j80 (sailing) regatta for the SATII's.  I get to the SATII's completely wired.  Last night I drank a few too many cups of coffee to study, and I couldn't fall asleep til 5.  As you could imagine, this wasn't the easiest morning to motivate myself to think and work and perform.  Yea, I think I scared everyone with the side of Hannah that has never previously exposed itself to the world.  like... "CAFFEINE CAFFEINE, NOW NOW NOW! AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!"  I was a bit "woosy". So, I did fine on the math.  It was easy breazy, but I completely fucked up chem.  I didn't know we couldn't use calculators.. and then I forgot how to multiply decimals and do long division.  Yep, I've never gotten lower than an A in Geometry, yet I can't do 2nd grade math.  So I freaked out and cancelled my scores since I couldn't afford to have a college see such a shitty grade.  NOw I have to retake them next fall! Oh man.  My mom freaked.  But my mom did find out a significant part of my teenagey activities today, and she was cool with that, so I"m happy about that.  (You can ask Allie if you don't know what I'm talking about! weeeee)  Back to the negative: I got rejected from the Seeds of Peace program.  Guess I won't be going to Jordan next spring break :(  I'll live.  Fuck this, I'm not letting myself be tired and sad when I'm not in school.  There's no use!  Time to nap............I'm officially free! I'm free! I'm free!!!!!  Good books, here I come!

      Wow, so school is over, and I should ideally feel free, but I guess the nonexistence of freedom has to do a wee bit with SATII's tomorrow and Driver's Ed starting Monday.  Rant time: I feel stupid.  Substances which destroy brain cells tend to focus right in on those containing useless chem information.  Yep, it's scientifically proven, and I shall do horribly tomorrow.  I guess that also has to do with my not studying, AT ALL, until today.  And guess what? I'm sooo writing this instead of studying, and going to the airport later to pick up/meet my sister's boyfriend....?  He just got back from Egypt, where he's been living for a few years.  I feel like he's gonna be my evil twin though, as the only things I know about him are: loves traveling, loves Middle-eastern culture, he was depressed as a teenager, he is earthy/liberal, and he's hot (ok, no, I guess we're not sooo alike).  I hope it goes well! I hope he likes me! Rant #2:My archenemy whom I used to play basketball with and I hate more than hate itself is taking driver's ed with me! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I repeat: AHHHHHHHHH.  Wednesday was tons of fun at mollywolly's.  People contact = fun!  I had to say goodbye to Nelly for the whole summer.. hopefully not longer than that if I can visit home from Mt School.  I'll miss her sooo much!  It's beautiful out today, so I guess I'll hit the books outdoors.  800 here I come! (not).

      Howdy.  Welcome to my "wacked out" life (according to Joe).  I will begin by explaining the banana and the cow.  So Banana because I'm Banna Helsky or because I'm Hannah Banana or because I sleep with a banana stuffed animal or because I love bananas.  There's that; now the cow: I bet y'all didn't know I'm an expert cow-milker.  Well, surprise! I'm also going to Mountain School next fall, so I wanted to enter that geeky blog world because I'm a follower, and I want to be cool.  No, Just Joshing! Actually, y'all are awesome, and I have to stay in touch and post pictures of me and farmlife.  Well, that all comes later.  For now, Hey I'm Hannah! I've got about 10 personalities, and did I tell you I like banana's? This summer is gonna be awesome.  One more exam!  I might survive.  If you don't see me tomorrow it's because my chem exam got hungry and ate me.

      Cuban people are sooo beautiful.  THe Rasta me are instantly in love with me when they see my peace sign.  You see, the Castro regime fiercly punishes hippies and gays, so the rasta men get psyched to see me.  For those of you who are not familiar with the culture, they believe that the more in touch they are with te world the more they touch the ground. Thus their dreadlocks are long and their nails are long and they{re so freakin sexy.. Don{t worry about the long nails. They{re not too bad hehe.  So, this guy in my groups got a thing for me and I really don{t get it because he{s so fucking hot.  So I{ll let ya know what happens.  Everyone I miss you soooooo soooo much! My group is pretty good.. the leaders are awesome, and I{ve written some great stuff.  Last night I went out dancing with another girl and a leader, and I learned the Rumba.  I{m nasty!  I{m off the the beach! See you guys soon!!!
