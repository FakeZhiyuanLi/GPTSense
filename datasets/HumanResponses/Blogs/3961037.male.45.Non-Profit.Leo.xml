						     urlLink Microsoft Outlines Quarterly Dividend, Four-Year Stock Buyback Plan, And Special Dividend to Shareholders.  Company Is Confident About Future Growth and Innovation Opportunities, Plans to Provide Up to $75 Billion in Value to Shareholders Over Next Four Years.    Under the plan approved by the Microsoft board today, the company will move from its current annual dividend of $0.16 per share to a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share, which would essentially double the annual dividend to approximately $3.5 billion, if continued at that level. As a reflection of the company's strong financial outlook, the board also approved plans to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft stock over the next four years. The company will also pay a one-time special dividend of $3 per share, or $32 billion, subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee equity compensation awards to offset the impact of this large one-time payout. These steps would represent a combined total value to shareholders of up to $75 billion over the next four years, if quarterly dividends continue at the new level.  The quarterly dividend will be payable on Sept. 14, 2004, to shareholders of record on Aug. 25, 2004. The special dividend will be payable on Dec. 2, 2004, to shareholders of record on Nov. 17, 2004, conditioned upon shareholder approval of amendments to the employee stock plans at the annual shareholders meeting currently planned for Nov. 9, 2004.     Our analysis:    Although the system is complicated there is on thing we are mainly concerned with: the special dividend because of its implication with the sharp change of usage of liquidities available on the market.  The special dividend represents $32 billion that will be paid Dec. 2 2004.  1/10 of today's Microsoft capitalisation!  It is safe to make the assumption although we will try to check it that the liquidities of Microsoft are made of short term governement securities or CD.  When they will be paid out it is probable that people wont be satisfied with that kind of return (1% to 1.5%) and will create a huge demand for long term financial assets. Stocks or Bonds.  The forseable effect is a sudden powerful downward pressure on the long-term interest rate (hence TYX): Given the time it will be done it can very well generate a non linear fall in the Liquidity Trap.    So by making something innocent, return you cash, one can give you the Kiss of the Death.    Microsoft will drown you in its liquidities.    Conclusion:                   1 - When you can turn to only one person or one firm to solve a problem chances are that this problem was caused by them in the first place!    2 -  When a pro says he made a mistake may be it was not a mistake after all.     urlLink         Protect Yourself and your Belongings:      urlLink  Activating Message
