       Somedays you just need to sit back with an old friend and get re-aquainted. in this case it was my old friend Jesus & Mary Chain. I hadn't really listened much in the past couple of years, but today. Sitting alone in this apartment. Bored with what i was working on. I dug out the old tracks and got fun. Head On...  Oh yeah, hey America... this shit isn't gonna work. Consider Iraq a lost cause. Way to go, you fuckups.  Why can't i be a stronger cartoonist? Designing superheroes is hard work when you cant see them shits standing in front of you. perhaps i need take about five or six different hallucinagens and call it a day and let those superheroes find me.   PS. Spiderman 2, you better be special.   PSS. The trailer for the movie "SAW" on IGN.com is fucked up.   PSSS. Is it possible to have three PS's?

       The UK Apple store is the new US Apple store. And pink is no longer the new black. in fact black is the new pink.   "Lost"... oh robert smith. how do you keep doing it? so amazing.

       sometimes you just dont know what to do with yourself. i'm dead center in the middle of a big heaping of that sort of thing. my family has never been something that drew me away from my selfish life (considering i've never really been close to any of them), but sometimes things happen that make you feel like you've wasted time. sickness can make you really start to look at things differently. and considering that i'm about 1500 miles from my parents, i feel an absurd amount of guilt that i'm not breaking my crazy neck to be there.   new york has been good to me. maybe i need to leave for a week or two. god only knows what i'm really thinking. and i don't really believe in god, so i'm fucked.   why are futurama, aqua teen hunger force, and family guy so damned good?  fahrenheit 9/11. i'm so excited to see what the country's reaction is to this film. i seriously was expecting the most overblown one sided pseudo-doc that i'd ever seen. i ended up seeing something that showed incredible restraint and intelligence. sure, its a cheerleading of the left side, but atleast it gives enough evidence to support the claims that are made. thankfully.   what a miserable monster we have leading us into the future. completely fucked.   and now we're going to hand iraq over and watch it burn. from our own hands. we should be smacked.

       Okay, so putting together a literary journal with a soundtrack from various bands that I've toured with, or befriended or whatever should be easier than this, but lo and behold i am the worst fucking procrastinator on the planet.   oh lordy... but the submissions. they are very entertaining. and the early layout of this thing is very, very pretty indeed.   oh wait, i never posted that last post regarding this whole thing. long story short, i am working on a literary journal. taking submissions from various unknown writers and whatnot to publish beside writings from a collection of musicians who will be turning in things that are different from their usual things that we see and hear from their music. an accompanying soundtrack will be in included in the hardbound book that will hopefully become a quarterly at the beginning of the year. so i guess thats about it, in a nutshell... i think.   in the meantime from writing other things, this is a wonderful distraction. also a wonderful distraction? rum.   enough is enough. i've got to go see matt pond pa.   someone please kick me.

       so i almost forgot that i started this thing. goes to show right there that this is just far too much resposibility for someone like me. what has happened recently?  new pixies song... "bam thwok"... oh you old melting musicians, how i love you.   saw braid reuinion tour. see previous statement (minus the melting part and with a little less love).   embarking on a mission to drink as much as possible in a set amount of hours is the single dumbest thing you can possibly attempt. my mind is still reeling from the abuse that i set forth upon it a couple of days ago. whiskey sours go down so damn easily. like drinking the sweetest magic water. slowly... nay rather quickly obliterating your mind. your head gets pretty fucking rattled when you look around and realize that you've slaughtered the better part of a fifth of knob creek by yourself and you've yet to really feel the strength of  the buzz. "you've drank it too fast" they said. "you should stop now while you're ahead" they said.   "you should watch your fucking mouths," i said. i drink like an asshole sometimes because lets face it. i am what they call, "an asshole". thats me. thats why i cant control myself at all times. its also why from this day forward (atleast until tuesday) i am not drinking any alcoholic beverages. nothing at all. only the finest in Juice/Tea hybrids from ocean spray.   enough of that talk.   The new Album Leaf disc ("In A Safe Place") has finally worked its way into my head. it took a couple of listens on the road and then a couple of listens on the iPod in the bed and then again while making birthday gifts for friends and then finally there were songs stuck in my cranium. Especially "Over the Pond" which features Jonsi from Sigur Ros. Just an awkwardly pretty song. I don't know why. But it is. And yep, it makes me feel a little awkward. if you know what i mean.   lets talk about spaceships?  the new killers disc... fucking hell. thanks fellas. my ass is shaking. and will continue to shake. more than likely because i need to do more jazzercise.   the sleepy jackson's "acid in my heart"... so damn good. for some reason its really starting to help me work on my new zombie script. i wish i could place why.   i love new paragraphs. new thoughts. new stories.   i love dot dot dots.   i love sleeping. goodnight. er... good day.

       is it just me or do incredibly religious people freak me out. i dont mean in the cute playful "hey steve, those people are bizarre" kind of way. i mean in the truly nerve-racking-stab-me-in-the-neck-to-watch-me-bleed kind of way. i ran into a batch of them this weekend. they said nothing to me because i was busy staring a hole in the wall of the elevator that we were on. you might have thought it was an elevator to heaven they way these people praised Jesus so openly.   not that i really cared too much, but i was stricken with the fear that one of them might feel the need to ask me if i was right with the lord and then i would say something truly repulsive for the queerness of it all. who knows anymore?  certainly not jesus. he has no fucking clue. does he even really believe in himself?  odd... lightning just struck my apartment building.   so moving on... stepford wives.... holy shit.  chronicles of riddick (sp?).... holy shit. saved... thank you hollywood for letting us have macauley back.   but oh my sweet lord those other two were so fucking boring and or hideous. watching vin diesel struggle with his lines is like watching george w. bush give a speech. you know someone way smarter wrote the words than the voice will ever be, but you can't look away because you know the trainwreck is still on its way. i am disgusted.   ps. bush and kerry... both of you should kiss grits. only bush, you kiss twice as many.   so... that new franz ferdinand jam "all for you, sophia" is insane good. and the new disc by the killers... wicked fun as well. if i randomly start shaking my ass one more time when i hear it, i might just write them a postcard and complain. good complaints. i hope. to bed with me. too late for this talk.

       so long. so, so, so long this night. MTV should be ashamed of themselves for televising those movie awards on a rotten night like this. what miserable, evil, sick fucks would allow that sort of shit to be televised on a night this disasterous? Joel Gallen, that's who.   I think i'm okay with this thing. but maybe not. My eyes are blurry. There are professional wakeboarders in the next room talking about "props" and "going big" and i don't even have a clue what this means in the context of this evening. It's not even hurricane season and the rain won't stop pouring. and i'm pouring sweat. my sweat is sweating.   the nights karaoke jam just ended. someone pulled the machine out and i just belted the majority of THE SMITHS "SINGLES..." collection to myself while everyone revolved around the condo drinking rum and cokes and eating instant ramen noodles. this is the life that i lead. i was supposed to be something. wasn't i? oh wait, no i wasn't. this sounds about right.   I just belted out "There is A Light" so hard that even Morrissey would be proud (or vomit perhaps). i mean, i'm not that mexican guy who sounds so much like him. you know the one. the one that gets the press.   oh my sweet christ. AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE is on. My brain is the muckiest muck. The skankiest muck. I'm going to find a bed. And then email Simon and Shuster and ask them to blacklist me. In the event that i attempt to contact them later.  we've got the land, but they've got the view.

       Okay, so yes this is the first and unless i overcome my viscious cycle of starting things that i never finish, more than likely my last post. So, i hope to make this worthwhile.   Drinking is something that i should probably stop because my mind is mud right now. Absolute mud. I'm in Orlando, Florida for another couple of days before heading back to NYC for good. It's an amazing thing this place. I've been drinking the skunkiest pilsner and listening to way too much Morrissey (is it really possible) for the past six hours and now the people that are living in this condo are making what appears to be the hardest decision of their lives. MTV Movie Awards 2004? or NBA Finals Game 2? Two many letters that symbolize words that revolve around... i dont even fucking know where i'm going with this. regardless. stupid ass choice because i can't imagine that anything is really worth watching (maybe the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs performance on the Movie Awards). I don't know shit about basketball.   Don't really care.   Even though Detroit is somewhere in there and i guess i'm from Michigan. Yay. Regardless. I'm done with this talk.   Spelling. Am i doing it right?  Three, maybe four more days and then New York and more screenwriting and hopefully a little paycheck finally coming through from this script. It's been a month since the contracts were signed and all i wanna do is sit in some rotten bastard of a spot with Brent the scientist, and Richie the ex-hippy. Get fucking demolished like we used to. Listen to some Smiths and Joy Division and call it a night. Something like that. Maybe just sleep a lot.   Seeing some serious shows because i dont know if any of you know this or not, but Orlando is perhaps the most god-awful place in the south. Is there anything here? Does anyone really care? Everyone seems to be missing two or three key chromosomes.   Oh, i miss my people. I've been alone down here (cue the Modest Mouse) for too long.   Oh, oh, oh... i'm gonna go get something worth drinking. Maybe i'll write more later. Maybe i'll post pictures. Maybe i'll capitalize everything that should be capitalized. Maybe, maybe, maybe...  That rotten slob, Fitches just called. He's a dead man. I'll be back. Let's hope.

       No. that's not anything to do with the soon to be overtaking of zombies in the city of the world. but rather one of my favorite songs by simon & garfunkel that is currently featured in a great little film in theaters that goes a little something like this:  Tom, get your plane right on time. I know your part’ll go fine. Fly down to mexico. Da-n-da-da-n-da-n-da-da and here I am, The only living boy in new york. I get the news I need on the weather report. I can gather all the news I need on the weather report. Hey, I’ve got nothing to do today but smile. Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da here I am The only living boy in new york Half of the time we’re gone but we don’t know where, And we don’t know here. Tom, get your plane right on time. I know you’ve been eager to fly now. Hey let your honesty shine, shine, shine Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da Like it shines on me The only living boy in new york, The only living boy in new york.  okay. yes. its currently featured in the wonderful "garden state" but i truly love the song and have loved it for years as my father used to listen to it on repeat. pulling the record needle back and forth, back and forth. the lyrics flowing through my young brain. sticking for years. even through my current screenwriting career and finally settling in a film by that sweetheart of a man from that so-so film "scrubs". he's all right. good guy.   anyway. its playing on my head on repeat. repeat. repeat.   i miss my city. i'm in orlando working on my reel. trying to get the footage to interest those that are interested in financing this film of mine entitled "pink halloween". don't you dare try to steal that great name... you bastards. its already registered. thank god. yep, that god. the one that i dont believe in. thank him.   i hate nights like this. the ones where i am so interested in doing things, but rather find myself 12 beers and several shots of the dark master jagermeister deep. it hurts my life. hurts my brain. i find myself floataing in the the deep end of the pool located on 1120 orlando avenue, maitland, florida at three a.m. i find myself with tears in my eyes and music in my head. with words in my head. with images floating. sometimes i dont know if i wrote something that is about me, or about others. it feels so real. but i dont know if i lived it. it seems so unreal. i love my life. in all of its fucked up glory. parents fading away and gone. friends grown up and gone. lovers angry and lost. my art finally in a position to be proud of. a bank account not to be afraid of. in a city that is amazing and lonely in so many ways.   what is it about new york city that makes me stumble the streets sober that makes me so damn lonely. feelings of black and complexity that interupt these thoughts on the this night. two days before my birthday. before i turn 24 years old. god i wish i knew more people in this place. truthfully. i wish i was not so fucking lonely. i stumble between shows and computers and gatherings and i throw up on subways and i probably have problems and all i want is someone to grab me by the neck and drag me to somewhere that has trees and maybe some cold weather.   this is too much. i'm going to start crying. to bed. i guess i should go there. its a couch. thats not mine. please take me back to that fucking city that i hate and love.

       okay. i don't really care that much anymore. it's one pm in the city of lies, er... i mean city of angels and i can't fucking wait to get back to new york. I get flown to los angeles when i only have two hundred dollars in my pocket and am expected to roll with these scumbags. the people of Warner Independent Films should be whipped with a cat-o-nine-tails. whipped right in the mouth.   i'm finding it harder and harder to wrap my head around the outrageous prospect of actually selling this script to a studio ran by people who would allow  urlLink Akiva Goldsman  to make a living from writing. When even the people that work for them tell me that it would benefit me to pound the pavement and find financing to make the film myself and then bring the finished product back to them for release... that's just enfuriating. what they're telling me essentially is that i can either go with them and allow them to radically change the story and thus the second half of the script, or else i can make it myself with money that i have found and then if it works, they will take the chance then because they did not spend the original seed money. fuck all.   the pixies' "head on" really helps with this sort of outlandish bullshit. it's only fifteen past one and i already want to pound a fifth of vodka and stumble into the dreamworks dinner to drop stone dead with my "unacceptable attire" jammed firmly up my own  urlLink ass . not too rough.   and at what point in my life did i choose to give up on the things that i want? i should be using my own fucking contacts and my own fucking talent to do this on my own. new york is better for this. i need my crew. crew: assemble.   september 15th is the day. the day when everyone is going to mount up like a  urlLink warren g  song. then i will have the strength and audacity to drink that vodka. and the rum. and then walk into some philanthrapist's office and demand things that people in blue cowboy shirts and long hair should never be allowed to demand.   "the way i feel tonight... i can die and i wouldn't mind."  i need to get back to that. i was there recently. i need it again. as soon as i get my head around this whole fucking thing that is film production and script sales. i hate "the business". its ran by  urlLink assholes  .   to lunch with me and then i get to run all the way over to some wonderful little beverly hills restaurant called "le somethingerother" where i can have people buy my fifteen dollar drinks of hard drink and eat unnecesarilly expensive meals for the queerness of it all. i want a fucking hot dog.

       I never follow through. i fall into the groove.   oh those lyrics. goddamn that tim kasher and his drunken lullabies. what a good guy. i kind of miss him.   to hell with chatter. lets get down to brass tacks here... i've been called lots of names this week. this florida crowd is wild. buck wild. they love george bush and jesus as if they were the same man. truthfully, i dont believe in either of them. well, maybe i believe jesus lived once, but i dont know if i believe in the magical jesus. regardless, i most certainly don't believe in the insane nonsensical beliefs and ramblings of a fucking moronic madman. especially when he's far too rich to be that retarded.   down here in florida, i will sure be lynched for these statements.   i can feel them closing in on me now. closing doors and threatening to attack. these fuckers can taste my non-republican blood. they want it in their jowels. they are fucked. and i am doomed.

       Wouldn't that just be the most swell thing ever? Ah shucks! I sure do.  Zombies movies and i are in a very abusive relationship. No matter how shitty they are, and how much they hurt my feelings for never living up to the zombie that they claimed they were in the trailers, i still go running back to them. i think the day will come when i have to take the initiative and ruin my career by writing a strong zombie flick. perhaps set in the old west.    urlLink The Corporation   should be seen by everyone (but as of right now, only if you're in New York or Los Angeles. Eye opening. Mind blowing. Chilling.   The new Lali Puna disc's title track is incredible. Almost as incredible as  urlLink Napoleon Dynamite's  brown leisure suit.   Tomorrow i have to travel back to orlando for a couple of days of mystery and intrigue and collection of my personal belongings. Then eventually i will have to take it back to michigan to collect the rest. Eventually i will have all three of my roommates in the city at once. Those days will be truly glorious. Energizing.   All right. i have to shower. And shave off this beard.

       so today has been way too whack. thats right. i'm in orlando again and the fucking hurricane is totally blowing through so i have nothing. nothing to keep me company but the liquor that was sitting here prior to attack. yes, we have a lot. and i will only be in this god-forsaken state for another couple of days before i head back to nyc, but there are a fair share of shitty drinks to be made. perhaps consider this:  THE CONFESSION: half citron vodka, a quarter cranberry juice, and a quarter red bull (yack!). the confession will find you on your knees doing shitty robot dances as teh dj (ie. me) spins wicked jams from various decades like david bowie's "be my wife" or thin lizzy's "cowboy song" or r.e.m.'s (radio free europe) or even even and jaron's "crazy for this girl"... yeah, i was on a fucking roll tonight.   THE SISTER OF NIGERIA: a shot of khalua, a shot of grey goose, a shot of baileys. a shot of coffee, and a shot of tea. really fucked up and tasty. these bastards were going insane to wheat's "i met a girl", prince's "delirious", and ugly casanova's "parasites". it got ugly after this. people were opening up the shutteres and letting the rain in.   THE MAN OF THE STREETS: equal parts Sprite and Burboun. So gross. but so drunk you tend to not notice. Anything played sounds good to these assholes after that. you know what that means. i start playing  Rockwell's "Somebody's Watching Me", and Jawbreaker's "Jinx Removing" and then i don't even think twice when i start playing Muse's "Time is Running Out" or even When in Rome's "The Promise". at this point everyone is gone.   oh how i loath and love this state of horrendous fashion and christian republican nonsense. is it so wrong that i have idea what i want out of a deity? is it so wrong that i would rather look to dave gahan or robert smith than jesus christ? perhaps i should have been hit by lightning tonight, but i was too busy sending out jams to shut people up.  i did take a thirty minute break in there somewhere to run outside in the middle of hurricane charlie and dive in the pool and let it know i wont go without a fight. the door back inside soon shattered and made me walk across glass which surprisingly hurt nothing. even my feet. there was an amazing amount of luck tonight. LUCK damnit. Not what you think. You shut that religious speak up.   at this moment. its only 2am and everyone has went home or passed out. my makeshift room is being occupied by two girls who i was told i was too gay to attract. special. considering i never considered myself gay. perhaps its the clean and thin thing. or maybe the making out with guys thing. but for christ's sake thats only when especially drunk and people look to me for guidance. then i like to shock them before giving them advice.   oh i'm an idiot. please everyone, just ignore this stupid fucking blog as you have been for so many weeks. i will be back in that damn city soon with my screenplay cash and i will totally let that place have it. toodles. here i come.

          okay so, now that that is out of the way... can someone please dear lord explain to me what would compell a backstreet boy to strike another human? especially a girl. boys should not hit them. in fact, backstreet boys should be forced to stay far away from them. ah fuck it.  yesterday was my birthday and surprise, surprise i didn't get blitzed like a fucking high school quarterback. instead i found myself on a go-kart track in maitland, fl skidding out of control. this is not where i saw myself on my 24th birthday. then again, i never really saw myself as a screenwriter either and that happened. i gotta get back to new york or michigan soon. at some point last night i found myself scowering my goddamn phone book trying to find  urlLink emily haines  telephone number so that i could alert her to my desire of wanting to make about fifteen hundred babies with her.  then i realized that it wasn't going to happen because i never met her and therefore did not have her number. i called other friends in other rock bands, and then realized that i had taken too many shots of something and stopped before i got to that blitzed level and spent the rest of night storyboarding with a drunken member of  urlLink small brown bike  who was only wearing a pair of sweapants that were rolled  down .  sexy?  oh hell. its late and i need to go listen to the new  urlLink pinback  album "summer in abaddon" about five more times before i pass out. drawing is not fun. unless you're drawing privates onto subway posters of catwomen.  goodnight you no people who read this. i love you all. thank you for giving me an outlet to vent boredom.
