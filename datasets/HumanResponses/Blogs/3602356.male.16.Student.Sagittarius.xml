      Here's the thing. There are these ads on TV about women bashers, and how women should call a hotline or something if they get raped etc.   Fair enough.  I think fighting is for neanderthals. People that fight are people who can't verbalise their thoughts, and can't control themselves. They are on a par with abusive people. Both suck.  So, anyway, this woman comes on, probably an actress, but who cares. She says 'He hit me, and said it was my fault', and this subtitle comes on the screen and says 'IT'S NEVER YOUR FAULT'. Bullshit.  Ok, so I say again, fighting is for cavemen. However, it's NEVER your fault? I reiterate: bullshit.  It is possible that she was an abusive woman. That she was a nagging, irritating, abusive cow who couldn't shut the fuck up, which is a skill a hell of a lot more people need.  It may have indeed been his fault, but it's NEVER her fault? Bull.  If you women out there want equal rights, you should understand that you are not exempt from blame for ANYTHING. It is possible for women to be bitches. Women are imperfect.  Sorry ladies. IT'S TRUE!!

      So I had a gig at the manly food and wine festival. These guys come up to the group and ask, 'Do you wanna be on TV?' It was for this show called 'So Fresh'.  Of course we say yes. They asked us questions like 'What's the craziest thing you've ever done?' and 'Who would you like to ride wit'?'  I turned the TV on on saturday, and I have to sit through some of the shittiest shit around, like Human Nature, and the most irritating and cute anchor girl, to see myself on TV. Saying 'It involved my next door neighbour, a buffalo, ice cubes, and a golf club,' and 'Mr. Squggle.'  What a waste of time.  Then I saw Britney Spears' video clip for her new single, called something like 'Everytime', a piece of shit if ever I've seen it. She basically goes on about how she hates public attention, and how the public are so unfair.  Newsflash.... YOU ARE IN THE PUBLIC IMAGE!!!!  If you didn't want this, you shouldn't have started. If you can't handle rumours about you, true or false, then don't bitch about it. Shut the fuck up and disappear.  One of those fact things pops up, saying that she 'needed help with geometry and spanish in school'. I'm willing to bet that whatever subject she took, she would need help. Dumb bitch.  I then see Jamie Cullum. I think he won pop idol. The english one. And with good reason. This guy has some good shit. I don't know if he writes his own stuff, but at least he plays the piano, and I saw him on Parkinson doing 'Ain't Misbehaving'. This guy rocks. Buy his album.

      I think blogging is the stupidest thing around, other than diaries. But because I'm bored, I've decided to start a blog, because diaries are for 6 year old girls with emotional problems. As far as I'm concerned, this my way of talking to myself without looking like a complete schizo.  So, who am I?  My real name is Simon. Yes, it is, believe it or not. I live in Australia. I'm in what I hope to be my last year of high school. I call myself the sax man because I'm a muso, or at least I hope to be. Guess what I play. If you can't guess, read my nickname. If you still can't guess, go outside and read some books.  Next year, I want to go to the Sydney conservatorium of music. I may or may not fail my HSC, I don't care. I'm sick of school because of incompetent teachers and ignorant administration.  For the moment, I don't care. High school, for me, is a waste of time, much like blogging. The time I use doing study could be better used practicing. Hopefully, in blogging, I'll be able to express what I think.  Probably not. It's bound to be a load of crap.
