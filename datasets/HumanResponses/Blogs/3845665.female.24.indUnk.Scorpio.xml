       I'm one of those people who must have a soundtrack to my life. I love to pop in Ani, Tori or Evanescence when I'm feeling very jaded and angry. And I love to cry to Sarah and Alanis when I'm feeling dejected. By far, the songs of Van Halen and Brian Setzer Orchestra get me upbeat and sunny.   And then there are the songs I relate to those I have known in my life. We all do it - it's a type of sensory memory of those we love. And I have some great memories.   Barbie Girl (Aqua) - Rachael G  What's Up (4 Non-Blondes) - My Girls at Camp  Dancin' Nancies (DMB) - Nick  Seasons of Love (Rent) - Brian T  Leather (Tori Amos) - Erin  Move Bitch (Ludicrous) - Nathan  First Kiss (TMBG) - Mark  Love Cats (The Cure) - Shannon  King of Spain (Moxy Fruvous) - Jody  Don't Let's Start (TMBG) - Jennie  Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk (Rufus Wainwright) - Jesse  Sad Girl (Moxy Fruvous) - Leslie  When Doves Cry (Prince) - Tiffany  If I Fell (Beatles) - Christie  In My Life (Beatles) - Paulie  Particle Man (TMBG) - Karen  My Baby Loves A Bunch Of Authors (Moxy Fruvous) - Brian W  Margaritaville (Jimmy Buffet) - Karla  Riveria Paradise (SRV) - Brandon   There's plenty more and of course, some who have more than one. But I'll have to think on them.

       pierce my heart, take wings and fly  love can stop my breath  like a stranger just passing by  familiar? there's nothing left   i thought i knew so much of you  i almost though you cared  enough to do the thing that few  can do, but you're just scared   i'll leave you now to live your life  to love and hurt as you will  twist and stab with that old dull knife  like a murderer who loves the kill   i gave you all i had to give  i even gave you more  and now you say in order to live  i must take flight and soar   i'll fly away on weathered wings  i'll crash and burn tonight  the salt in my wrists now only stings  leaving never felt so right   goodnight my sweet, i'll pray we meet  in a life where you can see  our hearts so close, intertwined beat after beat  but for now, i'm free   oh bloody sea  take hold of me    copyright Maple de Fische 2004

       I can be haughty and snide. I can be vindictive and unforgiving. I can be frustrating and unrelenting.   But the nicest thing is when those who know me the best simply except me - for me. :P   ..........   Thank you to the souls out there that are excepting without judgement... forgiving without question... always there. Thank you so very much from us&nbsp;- the misunderstood, complicated, difficult freaks with porcelain hearts.    Dedicated to You Know Who

        urlLink       Three Wise Men     There is a hidden passion in me for photography. Maybe it's my education in journalism or my continuing fascination with beauty. There's something almost magic about a photo. It's a moment in time and there will never be another moment like that one.     I particularly love experimenting with strange subject matter, i.e. the gnomes from my back yard seen above. It let's me show the fun side to life while still managing to be artistic. I'll have more examples tomorrow after I commune with nature for a good 6 hours (curse you, fluorescent light bulb gods - I will be FREE!!!).

       At the turn of the eighteenth century, a new idea began popping up in the New World: freedom.  This radical idea stemmed from many sources, such as excessive tax and no representation in parliament for America, but one of the building blocks was the new religious thinking.  Deism began to gain popularity and Benjamin Franklin, a founding father with true influence on the fight for independence, used deism as a base for his growing beliefs in freedom.   	The gaining popularity of deism was a drastic change from the strict belief systems, such as with the Puritans.  Deism is the belief that God created the world, but is no longer directly involved in the things that go on within the world.  God was like a watchmaker: once the watch was created and wound up, He had little to do with the watch anymore.  Deism also holds that nature is the source of spirituality, and that the individual is in charge of his or her own faith.  As Benjamin Franklin put it, a deist’s mind is his or her church.  Deism allowed people searching for a greater good to be comforted by knowing that they controlled their own destiny, not some god who was all-powerful.  Deism made organized church unnecessary and focused on the individual for the concentration of faith.  In addition, it made free thinkers of the settlers in America, free to think on things like independence and freedom of government on their own terms and not those of an organized church.  	An example of a Deist thinker, Benjamin Franklin would someday become one of the most respected and celebrated men in history.  He found many faults in organized religion and therefore, attempted to remove himself from it.  His autobiography shows the amazing logic-based journey he took in his own mind to come to grips with his belief system.  In the course of such a logical argument, he stumbled upon his own bases for belief. 	 I grew convinced that Truth, Sincerity, and Integrity in Dealings between Man and Man, were of the utmost Importance to the Felicity of Life, and I formed written Resolutions, (which still remain in my Journal Book) to practice them ever while I live.  Revelation had indeed no weight with me as such, but I entertain’d an Opinion, that tho’ certain Actions might not be bad because they were forbidden by it, or good because it commanded them; yet probably those Actions might be forbidden because they were bad for us, or commanded because they were beneficial to us, in their own Natures, in all Circumstances of things considered.  	He discovered, by searching the church that was his mind, that truth, sincerity, and integrity are virtues vital to life.  Franklin showed a Deist’s learning of religion in the earliest stages.  Furthermore, Franklin goes on to begin to apply his discovery to everyday life and problems.  Franklin demonstrates the powers that Deism provided for free thinkers: the ability to reason through faith, and the freedom to make one’s own mind.  Franklin was clearly a Deist as can be seen in his description of his beliefs in his autobiography.  “...I never doubted, for instance, the Existence of the Deity, that he made the World and govern’d it by his Providence; that the most acceptable Service of God was doing Good to man; that our Souls are immortal; and that all Crime will be punished and Virtue rewarded wither here or hereafter...”.  Deists took their beliefs from the original and organized religions, but made them more free and open to interpretation.  Franklin rarely attended church, for he believed that by using Sunday as his day of studying, he was enriching his church within his mind.  A focus on free thinking allowed for educated minds which led to a dissatisfaction with the affairs of state in America.   	Through the free nature of Deism, colonists in America such as Benjamin Franklin began to think logically about their situations.  In retrospect, Deism allowed the growing revolution to flourish in men’s minds and hearts by building a church of the mind and letting each man control his destiny.

       I know many of you probably believe it childish or juvenile. But to be completely honest, there is nothing that gets me through the week better than the promise of Sunday Night Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. (I know I'm sad...no need to email me.)  Adult Swim features brainless, mind-numbing fun! I get so excited at 10:50 pm on Sundays...The shows are truly amazing to me. Let's take an example and I will show you.   Now my friends know my favorite cartoon on AS is  Aqua Teen Hunger Force  (with  SeaLab 2021  in close second), but I wanted to focus on a great episode of  Home Movies . The premise of the show, for the non-savvy AS people, is three little kids (Brendan, Jason, and Melissa) are aspiring movie-makers. They typically make very bad films that usually are based off another Hollywood film. This week's episode featured their movie "Amy Lee", a rip-off of the indie-film favorite "Amelie". Throughout the episode, Brendan tries to improve other character's lives by helping them (as in boxing with his grandfather and eventually knocking him out) or reminding others of what's important (as he does in giving his soccer coach, McGirk, a kilt so he may relive his childhood as a champion Scottish high-stepping dancer). Although the show uses its premises to make great jokes and irony for the audience, the real humor is in the reality of the story.the reminder that our youth is short and we should enjoy it while we have it.   Or maybe it's just about some crazy kids who are really bad actors/movie-makers!

       So, I've explained my love of those poets who I feel close to both in spirit and mentality. I'd like to now take you down the journey of Sylvia's own words. Here is the printed poem  Lady Lazarus  from her  Ariel  collection.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     I have done it again.    One year in every ten    I manage it----     A sort of walking miracle, my skin    Bright as a Nazi lampshade,    My right foot        A paperweight,    My face a featureless, fine    Jew linen.   Sylvia compares her own suffering to that of the Jewish people in the Holocaust. She feels the pain deeply and shows it with poetic power here.         Peel off the napkin    0 my enemy.    Do I terrify?----        The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?    The sour breath    Will vanish in a day.        Soon, soon the flesh    The grave cave ate will be    At home on me   She sees herself a decaying shell of a human, empty and hallow. It is a deep depression that causes this feeling, usually spurred by a great loss or isolation, both of which she had been enduring.          And I a smiling woman.    I am only thirty.    And like the cat I have nine times to die.        This is Number Three.    What a trash    To annihilate each decade.   Sylvia is known to have attempted suicide at least 2 times prior to her successful suicide in 1963. One was committed under her family home's porch and the poison were sleeping pills. Having taken too many, her body rejected the pills. The only scar she bared from this was a small scar on her cheek from scrapping herself on the pavement when pulled out. This scar is prevalent in her legend, Ted mentioning often in reference to her as well. The other attempt was when she tried to drown herself in the sea. She was washed ashore. Sylvia did go through electric shock treatment after the first two attempts to no avail.          What a million filaments.    The peanut-crunching crowd    Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot    The big strip tease.    Gentlemen, ladies   She sees herself as a spectacle to others, a type of sideshow act. She again reveals how low her self esteem has become.          These are my hands    My knees.    I may be skin and bone,        Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.    The first time it happened I was ten.    It was an accident.        The second time I meant    To last it out and not come back at all.    I rocked shut        As a seashell.    They had to call and call    And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.      Here are the two attempts described above.       Dying    Is an art, like everything else,    I do it exceptionally well.        I do it so it feels like hell.    I do it so it feels real.    I guess you could say I've a call.   These are some of the most simple and true words written by Sylvia Plath. She looks at death as just another form of expression, not as the reality that it is. This is common psychology for a suicidal person.          It's easy enough to do it in a cell.    It's easy enough to do it and stay put.    It's the theatrical        Comeback in broad day    To the same place, the same face, the same brute    Amused shout:        'A miracle!'    That knocks me out.    There is a charge   She is feeling trapped, walled up. She feels this makes the suicide easier to achieve, which sadly it did.          For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge    For the hearing of my heart----    It really goes.        And there is a charge, a very large charge    For a word or a touch    Or a bit of blood        Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.    So, so, Herr Doktor.    So, Herr Enemy.   Here's another allusion back to the Holocaust metaphor. She feels electric, excited even at the prospect of a new challenge. Sylvia was a well-known perfectionist and hated to see the failure of any of her works, including suicide (again seeing it as a work of art).          I am your opus,    I am your valuable,    The pure gold baby        That melts to a shriek.    I turn and burn.    Do not think I underestimate your great concern.   I think she talks to a combination of men here. Ted is surely one of them, but her former lover/teacher Richard Sasson and her father seem to play a role as well.          Ash, ash ---    You poke and stir.    Flesh, bone, there is nothing there----        A cake of soap,    A wedding ring,    A gold filling.        Herr God, Herr Lucifer    Beware    Beware.        Out of the ash    I rise with my red hair    And I eat men like air.   Sylvia rises like a phoenix, born again out of fire and ash as this mythic bird is. She is bitter at the male sex. She shows them great contempt.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  This is sadly Sylvia's most telling poem, I believe (I would rate  Daddy  as the second most autobiographical). Take my interreptation as you will, or make one yourself. But, let no man say Sylvia's poems were trivial.

         urlLink         I have a great fascination with those sensitive souls like me... destined to write in verse of great pain and suffering. One of my favorite subjects is that of young Sylvia Plath. Surely you've all heard of this tragic figure. But it's the continuing mystery behind her paranoia and everyday deductions that fascinates me all the more.   Yes, I know many find Sylvia Plath depressing and dreary. I find her inspiring and familiar, for in her poems, I see some of myself. Many Plath fans dislike Ted Hughes for his part in Sylvia's eventual suicide, but I see him as a factor to her living as long as she did.   My recommendation? Read some of Sylvia's journals and you will begin to see what I mean. And for god's sake, add  The Bell Jar ,  Ariel  and  Birthday Letters  (Ted's poetry about Sylvia) to your book collection. You will never regret it.       urlLink     Two Women Reading by Sylvia Plath   urlLink     Self-Portrait by Sylvia Plath

       Another week rolls to a close and again I have nothing to show for it, minus a paycheck that will be gone soon and a collection of handmade cards for my sick colleague. I feel like a splintered chip of maple wood today... jagged and hurt....dangerous and dying. It's a tough thing to live in the office space world we all eventually populate. Florescent light bulb gods sap our very souls from us hour by grueling hour. Carpal tunnel creeps into our swollen wrists despite the precautions made by facilities. Mind-numbing banter softly meanders into our psyche, harassing our freedom of thought and will to survive.   Morbid, eh? It's how I feel sometimes... trapped in my half-a-cubicle... staring outside through tinted glass to the busy world going on around us.   Damn it, never should have decided to drink tonight...............

       When people ask me about myself, my typical reaction is "full-blooded Scorpio". But, for all those not sign-savvy, I'd like to explain.   I personally have 4 of 10 signs in Scorpio. On top of that, my chart is very concentrated in one quadrant. Enough, technical talk. This means I'm very strongly influenced by the traits of a few number of signs. Now that doesn't mean I'm boring or constantly the same way.   Let's see... imagine a bartender blending a drink. Instead of mixing a gentle blend of alcohol and miscellaneous ingredients, he fills the glass to the rim with Grey Goose Vodka, Amaretto and Tequila. Unknowingly you drink half the glass in one gulp before running for the porcelain god. The drink? It's me.   So what does this elaborate metaphor matter? Well, boys and girls, Scorpios are known for two very negative traits: bottling up feelings until they explode and need for vengeance. And seeing that the scorpion poison coerces through my veins, I'm very susceptible to these flaws.   If I ever feel betrayed, ignored, left behind... I have an awful tendency to hide my feelings about the situation. That is until too many occurrences build up. I begin to see red and I can feel my heart begin to race. I drop subtle but stinging hints into my demeanor or address to those I feel have wronged me. I slowly let doubt and fear creep into their mind. Just when I feel them hurting, I explode with a self-serving diatribe.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Now you begin to understand this hellish existence. If I knew another way to be, I would be. If I could change the feelings that compel me to drive away others, I would change. But the sad truth is... I don't.

        urlLink     It's all a blur...      Let's just say that lately, things have been rough. I feel like overflowing glass most of the time, too many mixed emotions welling up inside me. I could cry at the drop of a hat. I don't want to see or talk to others...it's too much for my emotional well.   I know I'm just depressed. But this seems different than any other trough I've been in before. There's something more permanent about this one. I've been this low for over two months.   Perhaps it's the lack of companionship.  Kind reader, don't worry about me though ... I'll make it through this. It's just gonna take some time.

       As those who know me are aware, I have a lot of information in my brain that many would think completely useless. There are topics, people, places and times that fascinate me, which in turn drives me to study them in depth. One such example is the 1960's music scene and the culture surrounding it. In fact, I even wrote a long paper on the influence of the Beatles on the culture and trends of the 1960's when I was in high school (can be found on my website -  My Home  to the right). If prompted, I could tell you the story of the night Donovan met the Beatles in Bob Dylan's London hotel room or let you know the long complex story behind the song "Layla". As I study these little obsessions of mine, I store the stories and facts into my memory. At any given time, I can recall and spout out these juicy tidbits, many of which are complete useless for the real world.  On the other hand, if you were to ask me what I did last Saturday night or what date I last talked to my friend in LA, I probably wouldn't be able to give you the right answer. Strange.  Many find this facet of my personality interesting and even charming. I guess it has a purpose then.  More later...

       If you've ever watched the movie or read the book High Fidelity, you'll know that the main character goes into a diatribe over the importance and significance of making a good mix tape.  I am a student of this ideology. I work very hard on my compilations when I take the time to create them. I tend to include appropriate dialog from movies or television that seem to fit the theme of the mix. And of course, the mix always has a theme or at least is geared for a certain person, creating a theme all its own. I've made mixes with names like "Wild Plums and Agrimony", "Staring into the Abyss", "Take A Drive...", "Beatle Bites", "True Romance", "Happy Crimble To All" and many more. I've compiled songs to create the illusion of a lover's quarrel or even a mental spiral down into depression and suicidal feelings.  There is an art to mixing together the masterpieces of others in order to convey a message to the listener. It's something I take very seriously with every mix I make. Music to me is one of the most intense forms of communication, second only to writing a letter. But imagine writing a letter through the music of others... what a power that could emit!

       I don't usually do this, but I can't seem to express my feelings lately, so here's some lyrics that sum it up:  I've heard it said That people come into our lives For a reason Bringing something we must learn And we are lead to those Who help us most to grow If we let them And we help them in return  Well I don't know if I believe that's true But I know I'm who I am today because I met you  Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes the sun Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood Who can say if I've been changed for the better But because I knew you I have been changed for good  It well may be That we will never meet again In this lifetime So let me say before we part So much of me Is made of what I learned from you You'll be with me Like a handprint on my heart  And now whatever ways our stories end I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend  Like a ship run from its mooring by a wind off the sea Like a siege rocked by a sky bird in a distant wood Who can say if I've been changed for the better But because I knew you I have been changed for good  And just to clear the air I ask forgiveness For all things I've done you blame me for But then I guess We know there's blame to share And none of it seems to matter anymore  Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes the sun Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood Who can say if I've been changed for the better I do believe I have been changed for the better And because I knew you Because I knew you Because I knew you I have been changed for good   ~Wicked
