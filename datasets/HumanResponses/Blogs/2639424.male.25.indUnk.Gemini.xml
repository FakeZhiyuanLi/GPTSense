      Sports Report by Lonnie "Ice" Kolberg       Hello sports fans, we are at the point in sports where it is very watchable.  Baseball is not too far, Basketball is almost in full swing, and Football is giving us everything we can ask for from exciting overtime games to games with no punts.  Since I am a baseball fan the least and basketball is not really exciting until after the trading deadline and during the heart of conference play, I will discuss the NFL Playoffs.       The AFC and NFC Championship games will provide our super bowl matchup when the Indianapolis Colts travel to take on the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers visit the Philadelphia Eagles respectively.  Lets look at the early game first.  The high potent Peyton express will battle a very stingy defense on a cold afternoon.  We have to take Indy's offense serious because they have not punted in two playoff games.  Yes, not two regular season games but there have been two playoff games where their punter has earned a check with no work.  "Yeah, right", "Bet" some might say, but it is very true.  They are led by league co-mvp, Peyton Manning.  Manning is in a zone like Jordan against the Blazers in '92.  Also he is getting help again from Edgerrin James who is looking like his old self while stiff arming tacklers and breaking to the outside.(*Note to the public:  Look out for my Edge James jersey if they win.)  On the other side of the ball there will be one of if not The toughest, smartest, and most disciplined defense in the NFL.  The battle will be NE's defensive backs verus Indy's wide receivers.  In this game, I like the Colts to pull off the upset.  They are playing good ball now and I dont think New England's offense can keep up.  Pick: Colts by 5.   Check Back Later on in the day when I will give my pick for the second game in Philly. But now lets here the "Word of the Day" from my man Reggie.   "Word of the Day" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   (Clearing my throat)....aahhhemmm. The words of the day is Sycophant. Im a tell yall what Webster say it is then Im 'on tell yell how we use it down in the country.  Webster: sycophant \SIK-uh-fuhnt\, noun: A person who seeks favor by flattering people of wealth or influence; a parasite; a toady.  Reggie: Luprecia was on the bus and said Mr. Watkins was sitting in front of her. Well she said Mr. Watkins farted, and the sycophant that thang RIGHT in her face.

      "History Moment" By Reggie Dinkins Jr.  Today's moment in Nigga History has been brought to u by McDowells, "why get a Big Mac, when u can get a Big Mc".   it was on this day in 1935, when the NCCAP (National Colored Caucaus of Athletic Progress) came up with the original idea to decide a national basketball champion in collegiate sports.  some of the charter members included Alabama A&M, Fisk, Jackson State, Hampton, Howard and St. Augustine's.  Then President of Jackson State University, Dr. LeCharles Rollark came up with the idea of an 8-team tourney to claim the rights to the nation's top honor.   The tournament was to be held in Tennessee at the renown Boodrum Collesium off of Interstate 10. The tournament was a big success and 2 universities were invited to complete the 8-team format: Virginia Union and Texas A&I.  Jackson State was the eventual winner as they defeated St. Augustines in the championship game, due to a questionable call.  St Augustines star player C. Jameson, made a bucket while fouled, to put his team with in 1.  however with 2.2 remaining on the clock, the clock continued to run, and the game ended with Jackson State ahead 108-107.   the suspicion circled around Rollark, which caused a huge frakas and the tourney faced disbanment, but the idea was adopted by Kentucky and they implemented it on a national level, but blocking us niggas from playing in the process.  However the original 8 charter schools served to be innovators for the NCAA and The Barry Farms' Goodman League Summer Classic.  January 15th, a day of greatness and conspiracy, as are so many others.   "anything prior to previous cannot exist because previous is and was priors beginning"   -Reggie Dinkins, Jr-

      "This Day in Nigga History" By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esquire  On this day in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and twenty nine, two ex-cons, Rembert Martin and Clovell Hennessy would change the way that Afro-Americans would purchase and consume spiritous liquors. Rembert and Clovell worked in a fruit packaging factory in Backwood, Georgia. Rembert was in charge of putting the grapes in the little plastic bags, and Clovell's main job was unloading the watermelons off the service trucks. (He sho' did love it when a nigger apple would "accidentally" fall to the ground.) The two didn't make much money there, so Rembert decided that every day he would steal two grapes until he had enough to make about ten bottles of moonshine. Clovell did the same. When they got enough grapes, they snuck into the factory at night to make their moonshine. Rembert brought 10 of his girlfriend's tall slender green bottles that she kept her hair relaxer in and Clovell's bottles were clear. As they mixed their grapes with the grain alcohol, Rembert had the great idea to mix in some of the bosses "yac". "Yac" was a sweetener that they put in some of the fruit. Just as Rembert was mixing in the "yac" the boss showed up and and shouted "What you two cons doing with my yac?!" Rembert and Clovell broke out and never came back to work again. The boss tasted the two concoctions they left behind an was quite surprised.  The next day, the fruit factory closed and they were in the business of making fine congac. Rembert Martin and Clovell Hennessey, pioneers in getting niggas drunk since January 14, 1929. All the niggas outside of Bass, Tic-Toc and Dave Brown's Liquor Store salute you, as do I.

      Sal's Corner "The Day you found out....."  Im writing this article because Im tired of people going thru depression. Depression is a part of life from time to time but the best way to deal with it is addressing the problem AND find a solution. So lets just talk about "The day you found out....."   *The day you found out.......That you are fat. Yes it happens. You are about 25-30 years old. You eat the same way you did at 18 but your body doesnt respond to that food the same way it did before. You used to be able to eat a Whopper and still go out and play basketball, now you eat a whopper and you cant even walk a flight of steps. You look down at your midsection and its just terrible looking.   Solution: Forget exercising, just find outfits that make you look cool. So what you're bigger, just buy a bigger size. Dont try to lose weight, just buy a cool sweatsuit and keep your hair done/cut to make your size more sleek.  *The day you found out........You are going bald. This is a sensitive topic for some males. I myself have a slight bald spot. I dont get upset I just see it as a setback and I just gotta be a lil more cooler than the next man. I mean its nothing to me cause my hairline been doing backflips since the 96 olympics. The day I found out was when I was trying on some jeans in Hechts. They got the mirror that shows every angle of your body. I looked into one mirror and saw the spot. I wasnt startled nor was I saddened. Its like this....You know how when you go outta town wit someone, usually you know when yall are leaving to go outta town but you dont know what time you are coming back. You probably know the day but not the exact time. But then you get that call from your man at 9:00 A.M. on Sunday saying "Hey we leaving at 12:00". Even though you aint ready to leave at 12:00, it really dont matter so you say "Aight then". Thats kinda how it was when I saw my bald spot. I just said "Aight this is how its gonna be huh God?, you gonna do ya boy like this at 23 huh?"  Solution: On a serious note, dont do the Toupe' thing. Dont do the slick back thing or pullover thing. If you got money for hair restoration surgery, you CAN do that cause it is rightfully your hair. As for me, Im just gonna keep my hair cut low cause its nothing worse than a dude wit a bush and a bald spot. Also Im just gonna keep some fresh new balances and begin to step my dressed up attire game up along with my grown man casual look. Its all about sweatsuits. I might start wearing velour sweatsuits or them "Soprano's" type sweatsuits that just makes it cool to be old. Also the nice leather jackets with the collar flipped up. Ya know.......Just do things to make that "older" look thats been forced on you, work on your behalf.  * The day you found out......... You were not graduating on time/ and or.....you were staying back a grade. AWWW this is terrible, cause you really know WAY before them grades get home. YOU take the class so you know whats poppin for real for real. You know in January whether or not you are graduating in May. I knew my freshman year at Hampton that it would be a 5 year journey. My love for hanging out at the Union, sitting outside the girls' dorms and late night Madden tournaments let me know what was really going on.   Solution: Just tell your folks whats up. I told my parents, we just gonna call freshman year my "redshirt" year and that I'd actually start college the following semester. You know what though.......... I never really started college. I just bumped into a cap and gown and a 5X8 Index card and gave it to my dean to call my name. Guess thats why I got a degree in Accounting and now I wanna be a "so called" writer???? Go figure.  Sidetip: But you know what makes it so hard to tell your parents about the delay of graduation date!?!?!.....It be your female cousins and female friends. They ALWAYS mess it up cause they graduate in 4 years FLAT. Oh not to mention with a 3.5 GPA or above. And they come to your house or family get togethers and totally mess up your WEAK arguement to your parents about how hard school is. Oh yeah did I mention she has a full time job while she was at school!!!!!   * The day you found out........ You were adopted. Im not adopted (well at least thats what the lady who I call mom tells me) but I feel for people who have been. Not saying its wrong cause I commend people who take on the responsibility of another person's child. My only thing is that the child should know its true lineage. Tell the child that he or she has been adopted. Nothing's worse than not knowing whats really out there. And telling the child late in their years can hurt.  Solution: The child needs to know at least ONE real family member. They can meet all of their biological family through that person and keep in contact through that person. The child aint gotta be around his or her biological people all the time, but its good to know so that 10 years later you aint married to your real brother/sister. Your whole life you be staying clear of Women whose last name is McDaniels and you REALLY shoulda been staying clear of the Lattimore's.  *The day you found out......... your boyfriend/girlfriend aint wanna be your girlfriend/boyfriend no more. Thats a tough hand to play. Love is a weakness. The unfortunate thing is that when you love somebody, you cant hide it. Fellas we say "Man I aint love her anyway". Aight dog, whatever you say! Tell that to the florist who knows you on a first name basis. How bout the salesperson in perfume section of Nordstrom who remembers your credit card number by heart. Or tell that to the waiter at the Olive Garden that took your "takeout for 2" orders and knew that your girl likes the sugar in her tea stirred and not shaken. Love makes you do things that you cant reverse and thats tough.   Solution: No we dont condone slashing tires, changing the password on their voicemail or taking back jewelry and possibly a finger while you're at it. Respect their decision. As hard as it is to do so, you must respect it. Here's one tip. Dont date nobody less than what you had. Being lonely makes you do dumb stuff. Make sure you dont fall back in a relationship wit any ole body. Step it up. The worst thing you can do is see your ex and you hand in hand wit some slum looking person.   * The day you found out......... You were pregnant. Fellas, you'd be surprised to find out how many young women who have been secretly pregnant, had the abortion and the whole nine and you never knew! As youth, we make mistakes. Some say the mistake is having sex. Others say the mistake was getting pregnant. Then there are those who say the mistake was having the child. You might say aborting the child was the mistake. Well I'll say that the child aint a mistake.   Solution: Make the best of the situation. The lil homie might be the next president or something. You never know. Whatever you do, ask God what is best and keep it moving. Thats real talk for ya.  Life is yours man. You dont like what's going on, step up and change the situation. In 2004 we will discuss some real stuff. Stuff like "Things you have to do before you die", "Say what you mean" and "Pretty Girls". Any comments? Hit me at sallimo@hotmail.com. Hey man "Next week people, Lord Willin and 'Rome Feelin".

      Success Connection Tip of the Week By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  "Success can be measured in Waffles sold, and lost in bread with mold"  --Dr. Jake Winslow, Owner of Waffle House#10, Richmond,VA--  Oftentimes a niggas' greatest obstacle, is the obstacle embedded in social fopas generated in the Southern United States.  Racism and malicious stagnation can be the unjust justification for stunted growth of an otherwise confident negro.  here are a few tidbits to help unstagnate the ingrown situation.  *First be confident, never let anyone steal your joy, or your bottom ho. *Let them know u know what they do, and that aint and wont fly. *Make them aware of two things, one u r black and I mean a nigga; and two that a wet bird flys at night. *And last but not least always take your pistol to an interview.

      "Don't Call It a Comeback..."  by Lonnie "Ice"  Kolberg   ...Because we have definitely been here before.  That "here" is players or coaches coming back to "scratch that itch."  By comeback, I mean one that has retired and wants to return to the game or is going back to their roots again.  We see it every offseason.  Some of them should have scratched their itch by rubbing their back against the corner of the wall like Michael Jordan just to name one.  Others are getting the job done.  In baseball, Pete Rose is still trying to make a comeback even after several years of lies and a permanent ban for gambling as a manager.  His comeback to manage or coach is unrealistic, but he should still be inducted into the Hall of Fame as a player.  He should never manage or coach again because he crossed the line but not as a player.  He deserves credit though because he is making money(his book) off of the sport that made money off of him.  Kudos to Rose...  In basketball, Larry Bird went back to Indiana and Roy Williams traveled back down Tobacco Road to UNC.  Both are having successful seasons, but we have been here before too with these guys.  Regular season success seems easy to these two, but it is the big game that always gets them hung up.  I will wait until June and April respectively to pass judgement, but don't bet on them winning the big ones.  There might be another MJ sighting before that happens.  Will we see MJ again in the front office?...  In football, Dan Marino went back to the only organization he knows in a front office position in Miami.  Now we get a chance to see if all those passing yards mean he can evaluate talent and put a team together.  He couldn't do it as a player, but now that he has more control maybe he can do it as an executive.  The other comeback that I want to discuss that the whole world is discussing is Joe Gibbs.  Yes, by now you have heard, Joe Gibbs is back.  He left his empire in Nascar to comeback to football.  He is one of the best coaches ever in the game.  The question will be can he lead the Redskins to the top again with free agency, a salary cap, and other new rules.  One thing for sure, he instilled hope and some fresh air to a organization that was on life support.  That is what happens when a big name comes back.  The organization is revitalized.  Fans come out of nowhere.  The bandwagon is upgraded to the full-sized model.  Every year changes are made whether to personel, coaching staff, or executives to give a new life and hope to the players and more importantly the fans.  Lets all see how this new hope pans out...Until next time be safe...  "Ice K".

Coke Plentiful Dear Nigga:  Unless your want to lose out on possibly $2,000 in one month, take a  glimpse at a note from a clut of uptown pimps.  Hi my name is Lumis Quartey.

Determining just how sinister one is can matriculate a paper trail longer  than a Luke Video full of tail.  This weekend i will be leading a retreat to the exotic forest of  Northwest  DC, the jungle of 15 & Monroe, home of the 1-5 Millionaires.  this  retreat will have special "Key"note Speakers:   * "Griff" of 15th & V will lead a  seminar on aggression management  * Moncrief the leading coefficient of Petworth's FBI will spearhead a session on female evaluation and  management  * Clyde Rigsby of Parkland Gardens will conduct a survey  session on neighborhood reparations.  *And I (YES ME).......

      "Our City" by Gartelle W. Sexton, Esquire  Disclaimer: This commentary is not meant to be seen as racist, nor is it intended to offend. The intent is to wake up the minds of our people.    "But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back"-Tupac Shakur   I ain't giving up on the hood.  And you shouldn't either.  In case you haven't noticed, white folks ain't giving up on OUR hoods.  They are coming in droves.  Gentrification, it's happening all over the country, especially in my hometown of Washington, DC.  Young, affluent and childless whites are moving into our neighborhoods.  They are buying single family homes and small apartment buildings in our communities.  In our communities where for years property values have dropped because we steal from and kill each other. We didn't take any pride in our neighborhoods.  We threw trash and beer bottles on the street, we didn't maintain our homes, we ALLOWED the youth to sell drugs on our corners.  We became scared of each other in our own communities.   "Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers"- Tupac Shakur   Guess what? White folks ain't scared any more. Now they come in, buy up the property and  renovate it.  Next thing you know, commercial businesses pop up, property values rise and we can't afford to live in OUR communities anymore.   What is behind all of this? Well for starters many of us are giving up on our neighborhoods.  Once we get a little bit a money and can afford to move, we leave our neighborhoods and move our families to the suburbs without a second thought.  Maybe its just me, but many suburbs, just don't feel like communities to me.  Suburbs just aren't real to me.  They seem so artificial and contrived, it's like they have no pulse.  I don't mean to knock suburbs because I have never lived in one.  I'm a city guy and I just can't fathom living on a street called Quaint Corner Drive or Apple Crisp Lane.   Now I understand that no one wants to live in a neighborhood rampant with drugs and crime, but our neighborhoods are OUR responsibility.  If WE keeps our streets clean, if WE maintain our homes, if WE spend more time with our children AND other peoples children, then they will not be in the streets selling drugs.  If WE demand more from our elected officials and stop complaining about how they never do anything for our neighborhoods, then maybe we can make some change.  You see, the folks that live in Georgetown and Capitol Hill, they don't tolerate inferior treatment, but for some reason we do in our communities.  I know that money makes the world go around, but we do a have vote and a voice if we choose to use it correctly.   Another factor in the gentrification of our cities is that we don't OWN anything.  Many of us are lifelong renters.  Many in our communities are not educated about home ownership.  Home ownership is ever so important in this country of ours.  Far too many of us choose to pay for expensive cars, clothes and jewelry, but have bad credit, live with our parents or rent.  Our priorities are skewed.  We opt to spend BILLIONS of dollars outside of our communities on depreciating assets instead of appreciating assets like a home, stocks or bonds.  We need to become financially knowledgeable and responsible.  Years ago two words were spoken to me that have stayed with me ever since, "Delayed Gratification."  Simply put, good things come to those who wait.  Far too many of us are more concerned with keeping up present appearances, than keeping up with our future and our finances.  There are numerous programs available for potential homebuyers that are FREE.  There are numerous programs available for credit repair.  The resources are there, we must make an effort to utilize them and take back our communities. (If anyone needs a list of resources, let me know.)    Anacostia, Shaw, Deanwood, these are our neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are full of our history, our tradition and once were full of our people.  These neighborhoods used to be some of the best in the nation. They used to be safe and clean.  The used to be full of Black businesses and Black people who were proud to live there.  Those people more than just lived there, they raised families, they built churches, they built communities.  Unfortunately, the only thing being built now are condo's and Starbucks (and I don't drink coffee.)   For years DC has ben called Chocolate City and that's how I have always pictured my home.  Notice how I called DC my home?  That's how I feel about this city, about the people of this city.  I was born and raised here, but I have been around the world and back again and I know that there is no other city with a dynamic quite like DC.  This city has so much to offer everyone.  And since this is still Chocolate City, WE need to take advantage of the opportunities that are before.  We are still the majority (decreasing rapidly however) in this city and have the chance to make things better for our communities.  There is so much more I could say about this but I will leave you with this question. When you close your eyes and think of DC, what do you see?   "I close my eyes and picture home... on my block"- Tupac Shakur   -Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.

      Sal's Corner "Martin Luther The Kang"     On this great day in history we are "supposed" to celebrate Martin Luther King's birthday. His birth should almost be like Christmas to us black folks. He died for us just like Jesus did. Im not saying Martin Luther King is Jesus but we need to give the man a lil more respect than we do these days. We dog that man something serious nowadays. Yall know how we do.........  * We use this holiday as "just another day off". He made it so yall funky tails could work amongst white people and thats all we do is be glad we off. Glad we got one less farecard to use this week. We can save some money by eating some leftover pig feet from yesterday. Shame on ya!  * We use this holiday to promote our parties. All these clubs sending out holiday party emails. Martin Luther the Kang did not die so that we could fall up in the club on a Sunday and drink Hypnotik till our lips turn blue. He did not die so you could wear that tight dress and keep pullin' it down and wonder why that guy wit dat fake coogi sweater had the nerve to grab your butt.  * We use this holiday to schedule basketball games during the day. I admit I want tickets to the Wizards/Bulls game. And by the time yall read this I might be down AT the MCI Center. But if anything the NBA should be off on MLK day.  Sidebar: What happened to the Martin Luther King movies that used to come on? The Paul Winfield joants. Thats how I knew about MLK. Not through no textbook. I thought Paul Winfield WAS Martin Luther King for a while. It took me a long time to adjust to him being the landlord on 227. But thats whats wrong wit these kids now. They need afterschool specials about drugs and more MLK movies.   * We use this holiday to get some "action". Stop playing dumb........I wont define what "action" is. Some of yall use MLK day to fall up in da club and THEN fall up in something else.

      Dirty White Lines  by Gartelle W. Sexton, Esq.   Yayo, coca, coke, cocaine.  This one time ingredient of your favorite cola is making a strong comeback. Maybe it never left.  All within the past week, we have seen some celebs get caught up in the justice system becuase of this fine white powder.  So we have, Young Turk, Faith Evans and the Godfather of Soul James Brown all "alledgedly" involved in some nonsense this week.   I know James Brown was high when he hit his lady, but he is a old man and bad habits are hard to break. (No excuse though James, don't beat ya lady.)   Now, Faith, darling, sweetie, thickums. Biggie would be so disappointed in you. You got young kids, get it together.   And saving the dumbest for last, Turk. Turk, Turk, Turk. Dumb, dumb, dumb.  Nothing else to say really. I mean we knew that the bling bling was just for the videos and that record companies rip artists off, but come on? Shooting two police officers with coke in the apartment? I'll tell Mystikal & C-Murder you want the top bunk.   I'm not even gonna get into Bobby & Whitney.   In light of these events, the President of the DCHU (D.C. Hustler's Union), Dontrell Carter, has issued the following statement:   "Yeah so uhm, we are deeply saddened by this weeks past events.  We hope that these families can make it through these trying times and move on with their lives.  We understand that the children suffer the most from this, but business must go on because I need a new Escalade and my lady needs a new pair of Gucci loafers.  Since the dealers who supplied these celebrities are obviously "hot" right now. We will issuing subsidies to the crack/cokehouses in their local communities.  To all hustlers in Atlanta, New Orleans, and South Carolina who are need of some weight and ain't scared to make a OT trip.  Come to DC on the corner of 18th & D NE and holla and anybody wearing a black NorthFace jacket. Due to the demand, prices have gone up.  However we are offering discounts if you bring us a James Brown Greatest Hits CD, Faiths's 1st CD for my girl, and Young Turk's newest CD (bootleg will suffice).  Thanks, and Happy Hustling'.   The DCHU also noted that some of the proceeds from the last 4 keys in this current package will go towards one night of trickin' in Dream Nightclub, an all you can eat dinner at Horn & Horn, and the building fund for the Rayful Edmonds Crackpipe Memorial Museum that is being built on the corner of 7th & Orleans place.

      Music News by Salvador Gabor       Today, Boozoo Chavis releases his newest album "Who Stole My Monkey", the long awaited follow-up album to his 1985 smash hit "Squash, Neckbones and Liver Pudding". This album seems to be angled to more of a modern crowd. His first single of the album, "Church Socks and Sandles" ponders upon many fashion questions that he poses to his grandkids about his outdated attire. These questions are often answered by his grandkids, 2 of who make appearances on the album. "Lil Nita" and "Charlie Jr." have a duet on the album titled "Can I wear yo' false teeth granddaddy?" and "Charlie Jr." also raps on the remix to the 1985 hit "Assault with a deadly hogmaw" which is a conscience song about health in the Afro-American community.    On a scale of 1-10, I rate this album at a 6. Only a 6 because his the album has no edits. At the end of the songs, Boozoo can be heard motioning to the studio worker to "cut that song of dere". Also he only gets a 6 because his music videos can only be viewed on Sundays at 11:00 right after Bobby Jones Gospel Hour.   Also Boozoo will be going on tour soon. The "Hard Porkrhine Life" tour is coming to a barnyard near you. All of the tour dates have not been released. An official press conference will be held at "Chuck & Billy's" On Georgia Ave. and Fairmont Street in Washington D.C. on February 1,2004. Also for Beta-Max versions of his album "Who Stole My Monkey: Live from Tugaloo, MS" call Mr. Archie Daniels at 601-768-7766.   And now I present.........   "Success Tip of the Day" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    "Africans forge the chains we wear in videos."   --Nathaniel Cook, Registrar Bethune-Cookman--  The root of our problems dont need to be dug with a shovel, just a simple spoon. sugar and salt can be lifted by the teaspoon. Hypertension and Diabetes are prevalent amongst black people all resulting to those two  things which are white, sugar and salt. Knowing this, fixate your mind  with these trinkets if you will.  Fill your mind with a Black Panther pamphlet. Newtons Readings Volumes 6-10 are very helpful with workplace Sodium.  Dont get even with your enemies, it will happen on its on, but a foot in the isle at lunchtime, should suffice.

      Nigga History Moment by Salvador Gabor     Today we salute James Weaver (also known as "Limp") for his discovery of a cure for erectile dysfunction. "Limp" grew up in the cold streets of Chicago during the 1970's. During that time he participated in Intramural Karate tournaments outside of the Cabrini Green Housing Projects. His Karate team known as "Gang Green" was the two-time defending Chi-Town Karate Crew of the Year Champions in 1974. Going into the biggest title fight of his life "Limp" would have to face-off with Jesse Manuel, the neighborhood champion from The Rockwell Gardens housing project better known as "Roc Mafia".    The best of 7 series between "Gang Green" and "Roc Mafia" was tied at 3-3 going into this final match. Jesse was known as a cheater because often kicked in the groin area and he was known for not clipping his toe nails. The fight began near the see-saws in Cabrini Green. The crowd was as loud as ever. "Limp" seemed to have an advantage for a while until Jesse did the unthinkable. Jesse sweep-kicked "Limp" to the ground and delivered a stomp directly on the testicles of "Limp". Jesse was immediately disqualified and "Gang Green" became the first Three-Peat Chi-Town Karate Crew of the Year Champions since the 1958-1964 Stateway Gardens Dynasty which featured Leroy "dont call me Toosie" Reynolds.     After the matchup "Limp" was in severe pain. The rest of the "Gang Green" squad went to party and celebrate the victory. "Limp" decided to stay at home with his girlfriend, Viagra Simmons. Viagra and her buddy Levitra O'Neill cleaned up the house and took care of "Limp" for about a week while he recovered. After that week, Viagra and "Limp" were in bed one night and "Limp" had some difficulties while he was Lovin' on his woman. For some reason his "soldier" just wouldnt stand up. Levitra was in the hallway and accidentally walked in to "Limp's" bedroom. At this point with two women in the room, "Limp" was ready to "play ball"! Levitra closed the door and "Limp" was back in business. We dont know who or what happened behind that closed door but legend has it that "Limp" put some of that "Lovin" in a pill and now we have the pharmaceutical drugs called "Viagra" and "Levitra".

      "Bidness News" Salvador Gabor  This is Salvador Gabor reporting live from the "New York Crack Exchange". Today we will give you tips and strategies on how to make your "bidness" work for you.  * Always wear briefs when out on the "pound". When you are conducting "bidness" make sure that you have a safe and secure place to tuck away your narcotic. Some prefer sliding "crack" bags in the seat of their drawls. Wearing briefs prevents unnecessary movement of your inventory in your groin area. You have to be able to attain your product quickly because of the fierce competition  * Establish your own place in that particular neighborhood that solidifies who you are and what you are selling. If the rest of the fellas are selling "BUSH" weed over by Mrs. Odelle's back yard, you come around that corner and sell your "fire green" outside of Miss Alberta's apartment in the building.   * Network with several narcotic entreprenuers. Nothing is worst than your "crack strip" being dry and the local supplier/wholesaler is fresh out of what you need. Maintain contacts with vendors across your city. You never know when you have to make a trip all the way uptown or over on the southside for your "bidness" expenses   In local Narcotic Entreprenuerial news, the price of a "J" went down from $10 per "J' to $5. Due to the inclimate weather, local hustlers are scurrying to get their bags off and get out of the cold. A Dub bag of skunk would normally only provide 2 to 3 "J's". This week local vendors are selling bigger bags to rid themselves of their inventory  In national news, The 4th Annual Harlem World Convention for PCP vendors was a success. Held at corner of 125th & Amsterdam, this event was a sight to be seen. Various topics such as "Police to Vendor dialogue", "How to use your one call at the jail successfully", "How to buy out office space in Chinese Carryouts"  and "What to do when two prospective buyers approach at once" were discussed.   That's all for now people  (Also 'Rome is back............   www.freshtodeath.blogspot.com )

      "This Moment in Nigga History" by Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esquire  Janet's tittay was exposed, big deal. I mean I was happy to see it, been waiting for that since she was Willis' girlfriend on Diff'rent Strokes.  But the media is blowing this way of out of proportion.  I understand that this was primetime newtork TV and children were watching.  It was not the place for Janet to let the world know that she got chromed out tittays sittin' on dubs.  But if the media would just shut up about it, then it would just fade away.  Now the kids keep hearing about it and seeing the replay on the news. This country is is so phony.  We make sex and nudity out to be something bad and something that kids shouldn't be exposed to, but we use sex to sell everything. EVERYTHING.  The Europeans got the right idea.  Lets just be open and up front with the youth, then sex wouldn't be as big a deal as it is now.   Lets also remember that this is not the first time a little nipplage has been exposed in a public setting.  Back in 1803, during haltime at the 23rd Annual Slave Bowl held in Jamestown, VA, a massive tittay was revealed.  A 19 year old slave by the name of Jane was on the auction block.  Dressed very conseratively, in a long dress and bonnet, Jane was being described by her master Mr. Finderbake as being perfect for niglet bearing due to her wide hips.  He also said that she was perfect for a late night trip down to the niggar quarters for some jungle fever loving becasue he had made the trip many times himself.  Finderbake made Jane walk across the auction stage, show off her pearly white teeth, and he even smacked her on that tail to show how much jiggle she had back there.  He then said to her, "I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this auction." and he then grabbed at her dress and pulled it down showing her supple busom.  Jane was sold that day to Mr. Harold Grammy of and set a record for most expensive slave girl ever sold at a whopping $5,000.   So you see, white men degrading Black women in public is nothing new, it been going on for years.  Lets hope next year some white man, bends Halle Berry over and smacks her on her butt. Oh wait, it's too late.     Bus Trip Announcement by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  I know many of you need a vacation, picture yourself in Fayetteville 8 days from now laid back eating some greens, and chewing on some fatback, dranking on some ginger iced tea.  Sipping on that drink with the toothpick in it.  This bus trip includes stops in Mt. Olive, Mt. Airy, Rocky Mount, and cruised control trip around the tip of Durham.  Check out the Bus Schedule and we can all go together. If you want to make your first installment please contact Ethel Womack 301.455.3534

      "This Moment in Nigga History" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Today our nigga sports spotlight takes us to an urban hotbed for boxing, Mayfair.  The welterweight champeen Lavette Blackman, also known as "LB" because he was the best lb for lb boxer on that side of the city.   Lavette gained neighborhood fame as a 10yr old slap-box phenom in the alleys surrounding Nannie Hellen Burroughs.  He once knocked out a 35 yr old Metro Kiosk attendant at Minnesota Ave, as a 6th grader.  he took the jacket of then 35 yr old Kiosk Attendant Samuel Williams, and passes thru the gates without farecards.  LB also attained neighborhood fame in the boys locker room of Fletcher-Johnson defeating opponents nearly twice his size.  He was the Jr. "Go-to-the-Body Champ" by the age of 14.   Lavette attained neighborhood greatness on the corner of Minnesota and Benning in front of the mural.  Challenged by an off-duty fed as he was going to the carry-out across the street, Lavette gave Occifer Blache a right hook to the body that really caused for some cleanup of the streets.  This punch gave LB a more potent name "Loose Bowels"  Lavette "Loose Bowels" Blackman hit Occifer Blache so hard, he browned his drawls and himself right there in front of the mural.  5 o'clock in the ebenin where you gonna be, hopefully not laying in the doo-droppings?  This saturday remember to cheer on LB behind the Armory as he takes on Mario Manning from 21st.     Quote of the Day:  "Love is pulling down a side street to let me piss, knowing that my trigger of human vitality would rather not wet your car but the brick wall of some alley."   -Darnell "Cadillac" Perry-

      "This Moment in Nigga History"     -By Gartelle W. Sexton, Esquire-   Eustis P. Malton was working in the same liquor factory where his great uncle Rembert Martin created his famous cognac, when he revolutionized the beer industry forever.  Now Eustis being the descendant of his uncle Rembert, was an alcoholic crook too.  Eustis would frequently sneak a taste as he worked and would usually take a bottle or two of the company's new beer line home with him.  Eustis kept a pistol on his at all times cuz them Eastgate niggas just went like that.   On 2/4/68, Eustis was drinking a few stolen brews with his friend Langley Meade.  The two got into an argument about some money that Langley owed Eustis for numerous bets.  They bet on a midnight cockfight down at the Benning-Stoddert Rec Center, they bet on a domino game between a blind man and monkey that Eustis stole when the circus was down at the Armory, they even bet on boxing match between the siamese twins that lived on Texas Ave.   The argument got real heated and then Langley stole Eustis in the face and tried to dip out.  Never the one to get played, Eustis pulled out his "nistol" and bucked at Langley. His missed, but he hit the brew bottle that Langley was clutching to like he knew that might the last sip of his life.  Miraculously, the Langley managed to salvage much of the brew because the bottom half of the bottom was left in tact and when it was safe to stop running, he took a long swig.  That swig was a swig like no other.  The beer tasted like shit due to the gunpowder, but was much more potent. Langley commensed to get pissy drunk.  All he could say was, "Malt made me almost died for this beer, but this sho' is some powerful liquor."   "Malt liquor"-created on 2/4/68 by two dumb niggas arguing over a blind domino game, siamese twins, and two cocks.   This Black History fact was brought to you by St. Ides, Olde English 800, and Steel Reserve.

      "Today's Moment in Nigga History" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  On this day February 3, a colored renown folklore was created, the legend of "Palmer Park Phil". This neighborhood known for dogfights, violence, and good "snow-shovelers" acquired weather-wide fame in the late 1980's.  It is around this time of year where people prepare for Valentine's Day, and/or and early spring sale.  Penny's has been known to make a few dollars around this time.   Many Palmer Park residents often wondered was winter gone, is spring coming,who smoked my last 3 cigarettes, do i need to save this change for the laundromat, or should i hang my starter-coat out on the line.  These kinds of questions circulated through many homes throughout Palmer Park.  Never to fear this questions would soon be answered in due time.   Every neighborhood has a local talented "street-person".  Many people like to attribute this term with  the guy outside of the formerly known DC Live.  There are others Charlie of Sheriff Rd, Brookie of 7East, and countless others to say the least, but Phillip Newsome of Palmer Park, aka Palmer-Park-Phil is perhaps one of the most talented.   It all started February 2, 1988, good ole Palmer Park Phil was coming out of the liquor store with a bottle of Martell, his favortie cognac.  he enjoyed the spicy taste of this fine street cognac, not to mention he acquired much alley lovin with the Martell.  During winter months Phil enjoyed drinking his Martell indoors, in the friendly confines of his grandmothers basement.  Now Palmer Park Phil was one of the more collected individuals when enjoying what he called the "Spice of Life" aka the Martell.   Later on that day upon finishing his fine street-cognac ole Palmer Park Phil decided to join the world for some later night corner warmth.  As he hit the street he noticed it was quite cold, and his shadow was malignantly shorter than on most nights, at this juncture Phil said to self "damn my shadow looks a lil funny, i could probablly piss my pants and not wet my money".  "aw but who cares it will probablly stay so cold i will have iron my underwares".  His shadow signified 5 more weeks of winter, and to this day February 2, we check with a weather-wide street person Palmer Park Phil, to find out if we will need our spring jackets or a scarf for the wintery chill.

      Sal's Corner "Niggas"  Since we are venturing into Black History Month, its a must that we show both sides of the story. See we as African Americans have accompished alot and we deserve this month. But alot of us still got some NIGGA in us. We rant and rave about discovering the peanut, the street light, and the tootsie roll (no not the candy but the dance!) But I just wanna show yall what NIGGAS do.   Niggas, they are the only people you know..........  *That'll stop eating at a restaurant after getting sick once, but will continue to throw up Remy every weekend  *That'll judge the average female on a tough scale but HIS girl look way worsa than the girl being judged  *That'll have a 2-way pager but no email address  *That'll go to college only to begin his first chapter of thug life  *That'll say they vegetarians but SMOKE all day. Hold up for a second. See let me tell yall something. I dont drink, nor do I smoke. Never have never will. But I eat pork, red meat, beef......whatever! And dudes look at me like "How could you eat that stuff" but they smoke weed??? I been eating swine since I was 1 or 2 years old. If you smoked weed and drank since you was 1 or 2 you'd be DEAD.    Anyway I just wanted to clear a few things up for this Black history month. Look forward to plenty of history moments that you never knew about being displayed here on "The Salvador Gabor Project". Now for our first history moment............       On this day in 1973, H.B. Lanier became the first African-American to star in a predominantly Caucasian sit-com. "Everybody loves Raynard" was a success on public access cable channels in Memphis, Tennessee , Augusta, Georgia , and certain areas in Watts. H.B. played the role of "Raynard", a hard-working janitor at a Jewish Fellowship Hall adopted by a Jewish family at the age of 2. "Raynard" grew up thinking that he was caucasian. He based this on the fact that he knew no blacks and he grew up so poor that he didnt have mirrors. He was also told that his complexion was due to the fact that he stayed on the swings at grandma's house too long and should have went in when the other kids came in. Despite all the misleading falsehoods that were given to "Raynard" on the show he never could figure out why his comb didnt flow through his hair like "Steve" and Bobby's" combs did. He also didnt know why his "brothers" "Steve" and "Bobby" had those kinds of ordinary names and he had a name like "Raynard". The show lasted for 3 years and the final episode took place in 1976 when "Raynard" meet his real mother, "Nilah" and couldnt take the fact that she looked so much like the lady on the cream of wheat box. "Raynard" ran away and was never seen again.    As for H.B. Lanier's career, it never amounted to much. He had a stint as a stunt double for Carl Weathers in the early 80's but got tired of wearing those tight jeans and maintaining that shag.

      "This Moment in Nigga History"  by Reggie Dinkins, Jr   Today we take a peek into the Nigga Community a look at Clyde "Toothpick" Boodram, a scholar, and somewhat of a Renaissance Man.  Boodram, affectionately nicknamed Toothpick throughout the Shaw community for having a toothpick in his mouth, and our behind his ear, has one of the highest street-aptitude test scores this side Detroit.  It is said that Toothpick coined the phrase "he got stole" when Breaker Johnson got punched in the face after the 1970 Soul Train tryouts.   Toothpick said that punch stole his manhood, and his dancemoves.   Toothpick was heralded as a street genious way back in 1962 where he forecasted in his  almanac, "Use Me When the Plate is Clean", that heroin would be phased out very soon.  Others scoffed at this fact, but sure enough crack rolled right in.  He has also forecasted the number of liquor store robberies for the next ten years.  Bass should endure only 5 over this time span,  if any of you were wondering.   Toothpicks forecasts were a marvel in themselves but the manner in which the information was presented absolutely damn-fabulous.  For example, his forecast of the usage of a third dice stupified many of the games' greats, such as Denny "Denner Roll" Rowe.  Here is a passage regarding this.  "You better watch out, big money niggas they gonna put your lights out, bring a third dice to the game, that Denner Roll will never be the same".   Here is a passage from "Use Me When the Plate is Clean", on teenage pregnancy.  "Hot pants will be the reason for a knocked up season, all them tight pants dont let the stuff do no breathin, they better take that chill pill because all these niggas are out for rabbit hunting season"   "im just the nigga in the seatbelt"  --Reggie Dinkins, Jr.--      Announcements by Salvador Gabor   * The 135th Annual Crenshaw High School "National HONOR Society" inductions will be held on Tuesday, February 17, 2004. This aint no Honor for grades. This is HONOR in these streets. HONOR dealing with how many niggas fear you and are willing to let you go in their pockets and/or take a portion of their crack sales. The criteria for entering this society is maintaining a 3.5 NPA. (Nigga Punked Average per semester).   * Dont forget about that bus trip to Fayetteville, NC. For more info contact Ethel Womack at 301-455-3534  * Tickets for the upcoming Metropolitan Dodgeball Association season go on sale next week. Please call 202-438-7676. Ask for Romell Cunningham but, its NOT his phone. Pierre or Donte will probably answer the phone. If they offer you some weed, thats up to your discretion but ask for the tickets. Also that phone is a Nextel so it might not work if they are riding through Southeast.

      Today's News By Salvador Gabor          Cable television juggernaut, Comcast Corp. made a bid at purchasing The Walt Disney Co. This possible merger could create the largest media conglomerate. With this move in the making, Michael Eisner, the chief of Walt Disney could be on his way out after 20 years of service. The bid has been valued at $54 billion. Reports are that the bid may not be enough. In the words of your average street dweller...."They dealing wit a whole lotta ink!". Disney is now evaluating the bid and will hold their annual shareholders' meeting on March 3, 2004 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.       Comcast is not new to major mergers. In November 2002, the cable company merged with AT&T and became the country's largest cable TV company. Direct competitor, Time Warner reported $39.6 billion in revenues last year and with this current bid, Comcast looks to surpass that amount. Together, Disney and Comcast reported a combined amount of $45 billion in revenues in that same time period.      Hip-Hop mogul, Russell Simmons made an appearance on "60 Minutes II" yesterday. In the interview with Charlie Rose, Simmons discusses his feelings on the state of hip-hop, marketing schemes with underlying hip-hop tones and how the "White Man" is responsible for his success.    In the interview, Rose reported that Simmons' empire, which includes Phat Farm, Def Jam Recording and Baby Phat bring in sales at over $500 Million a year. Ideas such as the "Phat Phone" and the pre-paid debit card for underprivileged citizens with bad credit have kept Simmons on the cutting edge of business. Simmons blamed the "White Man" for the development of his empire. Stating that because predominantly White Businesses were foolish enough to overlook Hip-Hop as a marketing tool and the fact that they wouldnt invest in the hip hop industry, paved the way for him to come in and takeover the industry.    Simmons has developed relationships with other powerful business men. Sean "P. Diddy" Combs also appeared on the segment and revealed that he mocks the moves of Simmons. He has mocked Simmons by owning his own record label, clothing line, house in the "Hamptons" and even being involved with a former model as is Simmons, who is married to his business partner, Kimora Lee Simmons. Simmons is also very good friends with Donald Trump. In a recent magazine article, Simmons was quoted as saying "He's My Nigga!" when asked about his 10-year friendship with Trump. Trump did not initally understand this "compliment" but Simmons explained that "He's My Nigga" is the BEST compliment a person could get.      On the issue of violent lyrics, Rose pointed to a song by rapper 50 Cent as an example of the day-to-day violence that we hear in Hip-Hop music. Simmons responded by saying that rappers like 50 Cent are products of violence, therefore their music reflects those circumstances. Simmons also stated that if it were not or these rappers, the problems of violence, drug use and poverty would not be addressed. Simmons feels that these issues are not important to the powers that be. Rose accused 50 Cent and other notable rappers of worshipping guns and gun violence. Simmons responded by saying "George Bush is a worshipper of guns. These rappers only imitate this 'Gangsta' Government".    And now............     "This Day in Nigga History"  by Salvador Gabor       This Day in Nigga History is brought to you by the Department of Broke Down Motor Vehicles. Today in 1991, Lativo Robinson, a Washington D.C. Native changed the face of television as we know it. Lativo was a funny guy. Growing up east of the Potomac River humor was the only way to keep a nigga from taking your Eddie Bauer. Shoot, the Condon Terrace niggas aint play....But back to this here moment, Lil Lativo used to make EVERYBODY laugh. He would reenact TV shows, Radio Commercials and domestic violence scenes that took place in the "terrace". Tivo made you wish you saw the show or better yet you didnt NEED to see the show cause he was IT. Tivo angered his father with these antics. Tivo's father, Cleveland would come in late from work and was set to watch the game on tape that his wife Vanessa had taped for him to see when he got off of work. But Tivo would spoil it. He'd reenact every move that Sedale Threat, Chris Mullin and Ledell Eackles would make. He would tell the score and just spoil the occassion for his pops.   When Tivo turned 18 in 1991, Cleveland Robinson put Lativo out. He had become a nuisance. When he began reenacting MC Hammer's "Have you seen her" on request for his cousins, Cleveland had enough! Lativo was homeless and needed money. He made some change reenacting show, games and commercials in households of the Condon Terrace residents. If you went to the bathroom and missed a dunk, just call Tivo. If you wanted to see "in Living Color" just ONE more time that night, just call Tivo. If you wanted to see Arsenio Hall's episode with Eddie Murphy (even though he was a guest EVERY other week), just call Tivo. Tivo would pop up in the living room and make you think he was actually on the show.   Tivo's reenactment career came to a halt when his buddy "Wild Wayne" wanted him to reenact a scene from a "freak" movie he had rented. Tivo said "I aint into that kinda stuff, plus I dont even like white girls.....even if I did, when's the last time you saw one walking around Condon Terrace WAYNE!!!" Tivo gave up reenacting and just bought a BetaMax and taped his favorite shows. This way he could watch everything over and over and since BetaMax was outdated no one else could borrow his tapes. Even though Tivo stopped replaying scenes from television some inventor caught word of Tivo's actions and came up with the idea of live replay feeds on television.

      "This Moment in Nigga History" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Today's Spotlight in Nigganess brings us to the world of cooking.  Today we spotlight the head chef, and only "chef" at the New York Ave Grill, Marvel "The Taste" Stuart.  Known as Taste in the urban cooking circles, The Taste has spent many years preparing sintilating dishes and cuisines throughout the Washington DC area. He has studied under many masters of the cullinary arts, Ben of Bens Chilli Bowl, both Horace and Dickey, and The Head Cafeteria Operator of McKinley Tech aka "The Soupmaster".   The Taste learned many cooking techniques from these great cuisinists.  The Taste acquired his nickname for his superior tastebuds, he could tell All-Spice from ginger by the crumb of a gingerbread man.  He interned at Pepsi when they concocted their new recipe for sweeter coke, in an effort to be different from Coca-Cola.  His tastebuds enabled him to tell the difference hence the  "Pepsi Taste Test" later changed to the Pepsi Challenge due to some worker's comp litigation.   Oh but the Taste didnt stop there he went on creating many new dishes and fine medleys of spice, sweets and liquor.  His chittling-loaf is a holiday favortie.  His innovation of the Kale Diet, known in Upper Northeast, this green diet has enabled many people better eating habits.  However his finest creation was his SteakadaTaste Sammich.  I have cracked into the Taste's Cookbook and discovered the Recipe.   1/2 pound of sliced steak (and or steak'ums)  couple of slices of cheese (Kraft or gubment)  Toppings: lettuce, energy matas, mayo, mustid, ketchup  Potato Bread sub rolls   First marinade the steak in half-a-pint of Remy, sure to seal it upon marination.  lace the greens with "greens" and apply the energy matas (tomatoes preserved in Gin for freshness), and the toppings.   Steakada Taste $18     Commentary by Salvador Gabor     In this year of 2004, we embark upon a crucial point in our society. This year's election maybe the turning point in our country as we know it. I was watching an ad for voting this morning. The ad talks about how 18 Million young voters went to the polls last year. The margin of the 2000 election was 500,000. And the ad goes on to pose a question: What if we get 20 Million young voters to exercise their right this year?     2 Million more votes huh? Its a shot. Definitely a shot. The problem is that its more than a vote. I use to wonder why people were so adamant towards us as young people to vote. I always felt that there is no "RIGHT" candidate. In my opinion, a president sees and knows too much negativity to be a "GOOD" candidate. Most presidents who have stood up for the "RIGHT" cause were assassinated. I always felt that "friends" of the administration had their hands in the pockets of presidents and that the world is actually ran by those powerful "friends". I've had many bad perceptions of politicians and thats lead me not to vote.      But the right to vote is beyond going in a booth and pulling down a lever. As I get older I realize that our ancestors fought for the right to vote BUT also the right to have a sayso in this country. See it's much more than one Tuesday in November. My vote begins to count when I go to town meetings and I elect the right city council members or even attempt to make a run at a local office. Our right to vote deals with the idea that even if our prospect is not chosen, the candidate that is elected will fully know that his opponents will STILL be in his/her face. We have to let the politicians know that the war is not won on election night. It's just begun. You dont have to stop coming to our hoods and shaking hands NOW. CONTINUE to do so. Let them know that you will see my face more and more even if I have to come and see YOU. You may have won the election but best to believe you will have a hard time if you dont answer to us as a people.      This year is the election year that we make the election not just a day's worth of time but 4 years worth of time. Its not about choosing the right person, its about working to ensure that throughout the 4 years that follow, no matter WHO wins, that your views and needs are expressed and addressed in the proper fashion.

      "This Moment in Nigga History" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   Today we salute a inniggavator in Black Fortune.  A reoccuring figure in many Black Magazines such as "Bidness Sense", "Somebody Special", and "Corner Banking".  Today our business spotlight focuses on Winston "Buck" Wheatley.  Known as Buck for his tremendous earning potential over the course of 3decades.   "Buck" Wheatley has many baby franchises like his 49% share of Winky Dinky Dogs, his Schlitz Vending Machines, and his patented spray-on White Walls kit.  However Buck's cash cow is a ski resort in Augusta, GA. Now many people questioned this tactic, a ski resort in Georgia, Augusta of all places.  His own momma, Billie Jean Wheatley was quoted "that nigga is ill, skiing in the Gus, i'd rather shuck corn in the dark".   Despite the numerous ney-sayers, Buck went on about the business of bidness.  He constructing this ski resort.  It was an awesome sight to behold, fabulous sha-lays, wonderful lodges, he even got a few restaurants to set up shop on the resort. There is a Port Arthur's, a Really-Dough Doughnut Shop and a Hopeland's.  The resort had tremendous rolling hills perfect for skiing, but no snow, and no cold weather.   This did not stop Buck.  He had a small plastic company called Glockaware. He had plenty of snowblowers which only produced water.  Buck had his GlockaWare creat giant 50-foot slides and he used to the snow-blowers to create the first Black Ski Resort "Nigga Slides".  Now many people thought "Nigga Slides" wasnt actually a Ski Resort but more like a water park.  But Ski-Resorts are taxed less than Water-Parks, because niggas dont ski, but love to swim.  His bidness sense help him keep his business' cents.   Nigga Slides is one of the best vacation spots in the South.  Many people come from far and wide to go to Nigga Slides.  The "Big Slide" is the main attraction, but if Dougie dont turn on the water you might wind up in traction.

      Sal's Corner "Where you WONT find your mate"  It is t-minus 5 days till Valentine's Day. This will be an eerie week for many. This is the week that you find out whats really going on with the one you like/love. I try to focus on the humor of male/female relationships cause thats exactly what it is.......FUNNY. People kill me with their relationship problems or what they THINK are problems. Just be you and trust that your partner and doing whats best for them and it'll be aight. But for those who are single and looking, let me spare you some time wasted.  *Fellas, you will NOT find your wife/future mate at the movies. If she at the movies, she's bunned up wit her boo. If she is mobbed up with her homegirls, she is not cool. Cut and straight to the point. Females worthy of your time go to the movies with guys or they wait for the DVD. PERIOD. EVEN if a girl DID go without a date, she's NOT going to the "HOT SPOT" theatres. Fellas we like to be seen when we wit da homies, females dont. If a group of females go to the movies, they are gonna keep it very low-key. So they got to a theatre where they dont even show alot of black movies. So if you got to see Barbershop or the next "2 can play that Best Man game of Delivering us from Eva" movie just go for the laughs and not for the ladies.  *Ladies, you will NOT find you husband/future mate at church. YES this is a shocker. Cause we all say the good men are in church. Grandma been trying to get you to drop that boy that hangs on the southside for 2 years and come on to church and meet Deacon Bailey's son. Well guess what........I go to church EVERY sunday and when I check my voicemail all I have is a bunch of calls from my homies! I dont have women banging my door down. See the reason why you wont find em in church is because yall are too picky. Let me say "SIKE" before I get a barrage of emails. But  SERIOUSLY, dont go to church looking for a man and for God's sake stop praying for a man. Yall taking up all of God's time with these "I need a good man" prayers. Then that makes me gotta wait in line for my more important "Wuz up wit helpin me BLOW UP when you get a chance GOD" Prayers. God said in is word he would provide a man for you. "It is not good for man to be alone". So that means just get yourself right and he will come.  *Fellas, you will NOT find you wife/future mate at the club! AWW man I mean if I could just get that through the heads of some of yall dudes, my purpose for life would be complete. I wont even speak on this any further.  Sidetip: Ladies you MIGHT just find your husband in the club though. Sounds strange cause I JUST said fellas wont find their wife there but if you look cute and you draw enough attention, you might reel in a Washington Redskin or a Wizard. Lord knows their minds aint on the sport they play so its a shot.   *Ladies, you will NOT find your husband in the STREET! He might be your boyfriend in the street but thats about it. Let me restate that.......Ladies you SHOULDNT find your husband in the street. But yall love them hustlers. Aint nothing like holding crack in a Dooney & Burke bag for your man, now is it? Aint nothing like a 1/8 of a "key" taped to your ribs on a greyhound bus headed to Raleigh, NC now is it? I know guys who hang in the street and "do their thing" but most of them arent married and dont wanna get married till they finish in the street. Cause its immature to be honest. You have no benefits, no days off, and no way off gaining ownership of assets such as property and vehicles. I know you get tired of putting all his motorcycles and 4-wheelers in your name dont you?  *Ladies AND Gentlemen (clearing my throat), you will NOT (I repeat), you will NOT find your mate on the internet!!! Now I admit, you MIGHT can find one on there cause one of my dearest relatives found her husband on there but thats ONCE in a MILLION! Hold up.......Aight let me tell yall a TRUE STORY. Just to prove my point a bit, I will dig into my own life. Im bout to get real personal. I met this girl on a chat line back when I was like 19. (True Story).......Now she was COOLER than COOL. She even went to school wit my first cousin and he said she was cool. We rappin and rappin and rappin. (Did I mention this is TRUE?) Im digging this girl. To the point where I would come in the house and ask moms if SHE called. So one day she really wants to meet me. I say cool beans. She's at work on a saturday so I go drive to her place of employment (This is all fact man). She tells me on the phone "I have braids, and I will have on some old capri pants, I gotta move some stuff today so im looking kinda rough". So im like "cool". I pull up to the job right.....walk in the building. What do I see........A TOUGH female, I mean the TOUGHEST of the TOUGH. Guess what? (True story) She had braids and some old capri's on!!!! Now I dont shoot dice but I thought I had hit my number. (Let me say that again).....I THOUGHT I had hit my number. Im like "Are you blah blah blah?". She says "No im not blah blah blah, but blah blah blah will be right back". I KNEW I shoulda rolled out RIGHT then yall. I couldnt have been TWO tough joants wit braids and old capri's on at the same job on the same day mayne! Yall dont hear me, I shoulda rolled. But the dude stayed. Yeah I did. Waited 10 minutes and there she was. But now I saw her from deep before she saw me or before the tough joant that I met FIRST could point me out. But I stayed yall. Yeah I did. I walked up on her and she wasnt my type. All yall out there who know me know I aint gotta particular type but when my type walk by, yall know my type. Guess What? SHE WASNT IT. We talked for about 10 minutes and I skated. She called a few days later and she knew the deal. She said "I dont think you like what you saw". In my mind I was like "I dont think you will like what I really wanna say". We never talked again. But it was my fault being pressed and jumping the gun.   Sidebar: Shout out to my cousin who COULDA told his boy that she wasnt all that. Whats that about?   My point of this whole thing is to say this.......you cant be happy in a relationship until you find happiness in being single. Find happiness in the state that you are in NOW. The singles always wanna be in a relationship, people in relationships always wanna be married, married people wanna get divorced, divorced wanna get married again and if that dont work then ya turn gay. Just love yourself. If aint nobody asked you out, take yo'self out. "Table for 1 please" up in this piece. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin". Get at me.     And now..........  "This day in Nigga History"  by Salvador Gabor      This day in nigga history is brought to you by Lil Joe's Hog Shack, known for its famous "Scrapple and Batter Bread" sammiches. Hmmmmm GOOD!      On this day in 1985, Louis Alexander Streeter retired from active duty with the National Organization for Grandfathers who Tuck their T-Shirts in their Drawls Association. The NOGTTDA was started in 1940 by Lester Patterson in Greensville, SC. Louis took over the position of president in 1960 when Lester got tired of wearing undershirts altogether and resorted to just wearing a button down with no under garment shirt. As a result, Lester was asked to step down from his position and more importantly he never raised his arms above his head again because he had constant sweat spots under his arms and on his back. His white dress shirts began to look beige because he had no under shirt and he was exposed and forced to leave the organization     At this point Louis was appointed as the Chairman/President of the NOGTTDA. In his 25 years of service he made sure that all members were exposed to the best in brief that had extra elastic to keep their undershirts safely tucked away. He expressed his support for Hanes drawls over Fruit of the Loom in several campaigns. He said "I'd rather where some drawls that Michael Jordan wears than a bunch of FRUITS.....I dont even like FRUIT, if Eveline cooks some squash thats all I needs".     But on this day in 1985, Louis reluctantly retired as Chairman/President of NOGTTDA. At age 81, he had trouble tucking his shirt in his boxers. He invested in undershirts that snap at the testicle area. He was caught wearing these kinds of shirts when he went to the public stall at the DC Dodgeball Championship Finals held in friendly confines of Barry Farms. When he went to the public urinal another NOGTTDA noticed the "all in one snap at the nuts" shirt and reported it to the NOGTTDA Board of Directors. They had a brief conference with Louis and he decided that it was time to call it quits.   Louis only lived for another year and a half but went on to start another club called the Straw Hats, Silk Shirts and Khaki Short Pants Club before he laid his head down for eternal rest. "Lil Joe's Hog Shack" honors Louis Alexander Streeter.

      "Questions in 2004" by Salvador Gabor  I had a friend come home from being incarcerated a few months ago. He spent SEVEN years in prison. SEVEN years!!! He left in '96 and came home late in '03. That seven year period by far has been the biggest seven-year period for technology and growth that we've ever seen. The internet, CD Players, DVD Players, TV's in cars, Cell Phones, Two-way pagers, lets see, what else??........you know.......The "Cha Cha Slide".

(Edit: Snoop @ the Grammy's was the first recipient)   (This also goes for movies like Malibu's Most Wanted, My Baby's Daddy and Bringing Down The House.  Movies like this are the reason why I only went to the movies ONE time in all of 2003.)   Special Section: Black Pass Revocation- Justin Timberlake who was mistakenly given a pass in the first place, has officially had his current membership revoked.  It was revoked, not for pulling Janet's tig ol bitty out, but for turning his back on Janet and acting like he is some innocent choir boy and he had no idea of what was gonna go down.    "This Moment in Nigga History" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  On this day we would like to look at an artist in the Nigga World.  Known for his stints on Soul Train, Solid Gold, and Live at the Legends, and the Quonset Connection. Breaker Johnson, an A-1 dance machine. Known for his pop-locking throughout the city, point blank...this nigga could dance!   Breaker was known to put the funky in the "funky chicken", the goose in "loose goose", and the sourkrout in the cabbage-patch.  Once a backup dancerfor Rick James, Breaker Johnson won Metro fame for outdancing a plenty of niggas throughout the DC Dance Circuit. On Thursdays the Circuit would hold a "Show" at Metro Center, right by the Hecht's entrance. Breaker Johnson took on "The Snake" in a welterweight matchup. The two put on a variety of moves, from "The Snake"'s Swinging Gate and his Chimmney Sweep, to Breaker's Carry-Out and the Pocketknife.   This was a heated "Show" it had been publicized for 3 Thursdays, The Snake vs Breaker was all you heard around the city, the pressure surrounding the event caused Metro to make onlookers pay to see the event (i.e. go thru the turnstiles to watch it).  Breaker found himself losing after "The Snake" performed the rarely seen "Sweet Potato" followed by the "Buick Hump" (later named the Snake then evolved into the Millipeede).  This forced Breaker to go into his bag of tricks, pulling out the Pocketknife, and jumping right into the "Mayor-Barry"  the crowd went wild and crowned the new Welterweight Champion of the DC Dance Circuit.   Breaker Johnson also gained fame taking on heavyweight contedenders, such as Fat Rodney, and Sumo-Ty. He also gained fame in the bad ice-storm of '78 when Breaker did the backslide down Lincoln Road covered in ice.  Breaker Johnson is rumored to be one of the founding fathers of the "hee haw", and was the reigning Hee Haw Champion from 1987-1993, when he failed to comply with the JYB and defend his title out of town.  Today we salute Breaker Johnson a "Nigga in the Streets".  And Finally.......

"Bay" was $25 away from making $10,000 in between the hour of 12:00 A.M. and 1:00 A.M. when the robbery occured. There are no leads to any clues of who the suspects may be.  * The 13th Annual "Father and Son with a Gun" Challenge will be held this Sunday February 22, 2004 at the Good Hope Road Sportatorium in S.E.

      Music News by Salvador Gabor         Buckwheat Zydeco released his album "Down Home Live" yesterday. Buckwheat, born Stanley Dural jr., was born in Lafeyette, LA and his new album reflects his journeys across the world and the steps he takes to going back home. Throughout his 20 years of performing, recording and touring, Buckwheat has seen many sights and throughout that tenure he never forgot about home.      The first single, "Come on in this here kitchen" is a song that reflects his love for the kitchen which is a staple of African-American socialism in this south. While frying fatback meat and stewing hogmaws, many convos have been brought about in the kitchen. A video was scheduled to be shot for this single but the old house in Lafeyette that Buck grew up in wasnt sturdy enough for the bulk of workers needed for the video shoot. Also Buck's uncle "Uncle Toolie" wouldnt move outta the back room for the 2 or 3 days needed to set up cameras and shoot the video.     After the first single fans can look forward to other singles such as "Drink up, Be merry" featuring Rick James,  "In my Jean outfit" and "According to my Accordian". This is another supreme album for Buck and proves more and more that Malaco Records is on the cutting edge of the Music industry     Local News by Salvador Gabor       "Stocky Tim" and "Black Jesse" from the Savannah Terrace Mob were arrested yesterday. These two are being linked to the Citywide "Numbers" ring which is illegal due to the strict laws in Washington D.C.. "Stocky Tim" was arrested when sources close to him revealed to 8th District Police that "Stocky T" (as he is known in the streets) took bets on Special Olympics races. "Stocky T" was said to have put fear in the hearts of the racers and so much so that at the start of one race, one participant did not move.     "Black Jesse" on the other hand was arrested when a story was leaked that he took bets on 10 and Under Girls Basketball games, Freshman and Junior Varsity High School Lacrosse games and the odds on whether or not Bryant Gumbel would win a "Black People's Show" Award which will be held in May at the Martin Luther King Jr. Ave Civic Center in Washington, D.C.     Details have not be released on the arraignment of these two suspects but word is that their mommas are putting together a bake sale to get some monies for their sons to be released on bail.

      "Success Tip" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  "Most of us have far more courage than Bravery ever thought" --Don-Don Stringfellow--  Today's niggas know not what courage is, alot of what they exude is false trepedations of fixed notions on being king thru urban survival.  here is what u can do to build Courage.  Call that nigga Courage from time to time, he aint doing nothing but fighting Scared.  Success aint always with Courage, i mean them niggas hang out, but Success sometimes hangs with Envy, and Courage be with Pride.  Criticism is that evil brawd trying to break down Courage, she is somewhat skitzo and goes by Constructive Criticism.  Courage does help with goal setting, he can sometimes lead u to Passion, we know how fine she is.  Goal setting can be attained by looking for thine inner-nigga!    Commentary  by Salvador Gabor  "DC: The Innercity vs. the Enter City"  I was having a convo wit my man Rome ( urlLink Jerome Baker  ) about DC this past weekend. We talked about the in's and out's of DC and the different perceptions of the city. Being as though he is from Arizona, I tried to enlighten him on the "real" D.C. Through our talks we discussed the different parts that make up D.C. and why D.C. is so misunderstood. I came up with the conclusion that essentially this city is a battle. A battle between the Innercity and the "Enter City".  The Innercity. What is the innercity? The innercity is full of pride, history and nostalgia. Along with those positive notes comes the notorious history of this city and its ties to narcotics, violence and poverty. The city where talented people would rather sit on the sidelines and say "I coulda/woulda this and that" rather than pursuing dreams. The city where schools have turned into gun ranges. The city where chicken wings are so big that you often wonder are they on steroids. Oh yeah dont forget the Mambo Sauce. The city where Chuck Brown NOT James Brown is the Godfather. A city that has bright spots but yet there is much work to be done.  The "Enter City". I call D.C. the "enter city" because many people enter this city with dreams of "setting up shop" and becoming successful here. You may be a college graduate or just looking for a change of pace and you can move to D.C. This city is not too fast and not too slow. In the early 80's many drug dealers from northern cities came here to this city to make money. D.C. was a goldmine for hustlers. Nowadays hustlers such as party promoters, corporate workers and young people in general see D.C. as their goldmine. This is cool. It's ok to come here and make a honest living. If out of towners make money here off of us and we dont take initiative to be the breadmakers then that's ok. All I ask is that people entering the city respect the city. In my convo wit 'Rome I saw that he was genuinely interested in knowing about this city. Which is rare. Most people come here for about 5 years, make all the money they can make, party and club and tear up this city then move on to another city.   I really feel that this city is in the midst of a major shift. Just look around at the new buildings and the political face of this city. Its not the same D.C. that had Marion Barry, RFK Stadium and the original Convention Center. The strangest thing about this new "movement" is that as this process of shifting takes place, the main people that will be left behind are the "true" citizens of this city.

      Sal's Corner "Using Valid Time during Valentine's"    First off, its Valentine's not ValenTIMES. Onward. I spent alot of time out of the house this weekend just chilling and observing the holiday weekend and how people took on the weekend. I was a bit disappointed. Disgusted is much much too harsh of a word but disappointed should so. My disappointment came from several ideas that we as people have about Valentine's Day and their responses to these ideas. As usual, Sal's Corner is about taking a serious matter, looking at it from a lighter viewpoint yet trying our best to come up with answers to these serious matters.   * I have a problem with people who have a problem with Valentine's Day. I went to a sporting event on Saturday evening and I saw 2-3 people wearing "F*CK Valentine's Day" shirts???? Are you really that adamant about showing people that you are a LOSER!?!? You dont have a date and/or you spent $300 of your money on someone and your mad........so you just gonna put yourself on BLAST! One rule I have: Dont tell EVERYONE about what's going on in your "love life". Only tell people who can help you progress with love. Wearing a shirt that displays a negative attitude towards a holiday which encourages spreading love is not what's up. God is love, so what does your shirt say about him?  * Fellas, stop acting like you really dont feel like doing nothing for Valentine's Day. You dont have to shoot me up.....really...... you dont. "Yeah man....I might get slim a lil something but I dont know???" Come on dog, save the ducktales for disney. Either you're getting her something or you're not.   * Females, why do you have to walk around the mall with you Valentine's gifts??? I dont understand that. I saw that this year and a few years before and it puzzles me?? If you AND your boyfriend are in the mall at the same time for him to give you a gift and he didnt come with you to the mall.............then there is much too much money being spent in that relationship. You should never just UP and see your boyfriend in the mall. Even if you DO see him, he gives you the gift, take it to the car.   The following are the TWO main problems with the way in which we celebrate Valentine's Day:  * Females, your competitive spirit sometimes clouds up a good day meant for good deeds. Females often time judge each other on the presence of or lack of a Valentine's gift. Women who have a Valentine, flaunt and brag about what they got and they feel that this physical gift completes them. Women who dont have a Valentine feel the need to feel bad. If you dont have a Valentine, someone is not on their job. Whether it be you or the prospective male. If you walk around with a mean look all day and no one approaches you, then you have a reason to have that attitude slap you in the face when you come up empty on Valentine' s Day. If you have a male in your life that isnt doing right, then move on. He's not on his job. Him getting you a gift doesnt say that he's on his job. Alot of women are full of flowers on Saturday and then full of ice on Sunday cause he's hitting you.  * Fellas, money doesnt get you to a woman's heart. Its the thought that counts. Time taken out to plan something, or going beyond her expectations of you makes the holiday that much more special. Valentine's might mean you cleaning her house, cooking her a meal or maybe giving one of her family members a gift to show that this relationship has longevity and that loving her in the long run involves accepting her family as yours.    In conclusion, look at what Valentine's Day really is. Its the reenactment of what St. Valentine did throughout his community. He gave gifts of Love to those around him. Valentine's Day is not about giving a girlfriend/wife a gift. I've heard the St. Valentine's story a million times and never did I hear a reference to him and a girlfriend of his. So if you dont have a girlfriend/boyfriend, it doesnt mean that you dont have a Valentine. Let's take it back to giving love........genuine love and not some bear in a plastic box. Plus fellas, its a leap year.............that means its Sadie Hawkins, the ladies were supposed to get US gifts this year!!!! "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

      "This Moment in Black History" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  February 28th is a day that marked a significant change in Black medicine and creativity.  It was on February 28, 1940, that a grand change took place in Black medicine.  this change was more important than those of Charles Drew and Ben Carson.   The man Doctor Chavis.  Now Doctor Chavis wasnt really a doctor, that was just his name.  However he was "local" pharmacist/negro shaman in the Shaw community.  Many people in the Shaw community, from Florida Park, to the Kennedy Polo Grounds came to Chavis for cure-alls.   One day Sister Ruberta Holmes came to Doctor Chavis for something for her headache.  Doctor Chavis have any Tylenol-like substances since his "clerk" Tyus Bodine couldnt get on the "Standard Drug" truck and access him some.  However Chavis did have something "doctored up".  What Doctor Chavis did have was Prescription Lunchmeat.  He had some lunchmeat from the previous Tuesday and "doctored it up" with some ginger and some hemp.   Sister Ruberta took one hit/bite of the Prescription Lunchmeat and was cured of her ailments.  she got a slight headrush but she didnt mind that one bit. (she loved getting some Brandy and heading over to W.U.S.T. to listen to Shaw Sounds).  Doctor Chavis made a killing with his Prescription Lunchmeat, doctors just up the street at Howard University Hospital tried to get a little taste and use it.  Much to their shagrin Chavis said no-suh, and treated patients from his 5th & S office.   Doctor Chavis made miyons and helped some local players in the hemp market such as Edward Vann.  He also funded some local businesses such as Ben's Chilli Bowl.  to this day u can ask for a burger with "chilli and chavis" and everything will be everything.   Doctor Chavis a true Black innovator, and a hero for the Shaw Community!

      Commentary by Salvador Gabor   I've been really wanting to go see "The Passion of the Christ". Not because of the hype that the media has dropped on the movie. I just want to see it in order to understand where Mel Gibson may be coming from. He's taking a story told to him and creating a visual based on what he knows and has heard. I think when it comes down to it, thats really what this movie is all about.    I believe in Jesus Christ, I believe he is our savior and I believe he died so that we could have eternal life. Thats my belief and you can kill me if you dont like it. But if you dont believe what I believe or what Mel Gibson believes then just dont go see the movie. Even if you do believe in Jesus Christ as our savior, but you are offended by the movie, just dont go see it. Mel Gibson is not a preacher, nor does he profess to be the perfect saint. I mean.......he had the nerve to do 3 or 4 Lethal Weapons, 1 and 2 were ENOUGH. But anyway, this movie is HIS perception of a story. If I saw "pee-wee" and "Tay" fighting on Georgia Avenue, I have a right to tell what I saw??? Dont I? I mean ok maybe "Pee-Wee" didnt get knocked down by "Tay's" punch? Maybe it was that when "Tay" swung, "Pee-Wee" stepped back and slipped on a plastic pork-rind bag and thats what made him fall? But its MY story. If you dont wanna hear my story, then go ask "Black Rick" an em down at thet corner store what happened between "Tay" and "Pee-Wee".     The whole point being, its a movie. Respect the time that was put into it and the artform. If its not your belief or opinion, move on. Life is similar to holding on to something...........if you wanna keep holding on...........YOU GOTTA GETTA GRIP!   Business News by Salvador Gabor    It is a sad day for all Gucci Bucket Hat owners and people who bought brown jeans for intentions of only putting G's all over their jeans. Tom Ford, designer for Gucci is stepping down from his position at Gucci. After over 10 years of taking all you niggas' money, he is deciding to call it quits.    Tom Ford came to Gucci to revamp the legacy that Gucci had established decades ago. Once a child actor, Ford was successful in bringing Gucci back into the thick of the fashion industry. With stock options in the company worth $250 Million we are sure that Tom will be well-off without the paychecks from Gucci. Many of his fashion counterparts and competitors were saddened by his move but were happy for him. He is rumored to venture into the film industry now that he is leaving fashion.

      The Ghost of  "Pleasure's" Past by Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esquire  Just a little reality check for the fellas.  We say it time and time again, "strap up". We say we do it every time, but do we really?  How many of us have been to the clinic? How many of us have had the unpleasurable experience of having a q-tip stuck in the eye of your member? Now that's real. Real pain. How many of us have had to endure that week long wait for our HIV test? Long week ain't it?  You say to yourself that you gonna kill the chick that gave it to you if you got something. But what chick?  You start thinking about every girlfriend and one night stand that you've been with.  You think about the few times you went raw dog and Lil Jon'd up in that cooter.  You start thinking about the random stripper that performed sexual "activities" at that bachelor party. Oh yeah, you forgot you can catch the alphabets from those "activities" didn't you?  You start praying more than ever, lying to God about how you gonna be more careful and go to church every Sunday.  You probably got so scared that you wished you were still a virgin. Wishing that you just had gonorrhea or the clap. For that whole week, your lady been wanting to give you some, but  you talking about you tired. Nigga, you scared. Scared that you died for some "pleasure". It's powerful.  So a week goes by and you go to get your results.  You are sweating and talking to yourself on the drive over.  Paranoid ain't the word to describe you. You nervous like Sadaam when they pulled him outta that foxhole. So you get your results. Everything is negative, you have a clean bill of health. Right? Don't forget, AIDS can law low in your body for as long as 6 years. But hey they said you are good to go. You are are disease free and think you are invincible again. And what do you know, you have another  bachelor party to go to this weekend.   Announcement from BOSHA (Burnt Out Strippers & Hooker Association):  To all tricks & Johns and lonely men at the club,  We did not, do not, will not like or love you. We did not, will not, won't ever ever give you some unless you pay for it.  You losers have messed up the game for all the real brothers out there. We, the whores, are supposed to be free. But since you feel obligated to pay for it, we can't give away for free anymore. You are not doing "big things" because you had sex with one of my fellow stripper/hooker sistren. We just have low/no self-esteem, abuse problems, and bills to pay. So next time you are out there trickin'  your dough for a cheap thrill, remember that pleasure kills.

      Movie Review by Salvador Gabor     "Finding Kito" is a "straight to VHS/BETA" movie starring Malachi Winbush as "Kito". "Kito" finds himself caught up in the drug game selling heroin on the streets of Newport News, Virginia. "Kito" is arrested for an Unauthorized Use of a Ford Previa on Interstate 64. The Previa contained a small portion of heroin. Not enough for a felony charge but enough for a misdemeanor and a trip to the Norfolk Jail for a night. He is released on bail and is scheduled to go to court in a month's time.     Kito reports to court, receives a year's probation and is scheduled to take urines every wednesday. But you know how niggas are!!!!! Everyday he outside on Warwick Blvd, Martell bottle in one hand, a J of hash in the other. He obviously doesnt care. He still goes to take urines on Wednesday. He called himself drinking ONE glass of water to clean his system on Tuesday night. Essentially he was given an ultimatum. After 8 straight dirty urines, he is threatened to be "stepped back" to the Newport News Jail. He then misses the rest of his urine dates and is "on the run".      This movie is your typical drug dealer movie minus the love story that ends in domestic violence or death by a driveby. I rate this movie at 3 out of 5. Malachi Winbush is not an experienced actor and there were scenes where the director was seen in the corner of the screen handing him the script. Also the microphone often time was seen dropping into the screen and Malachi was often talking with his head upward so that he could speak into the camera.     This is Salvador Gabor reporting from the movies. Look forward to future movie features such as "Layaway", the prequel to "Paid in Full" and "The Life and Times of Dirty Dougie". This report is sponsored and has been brought to you by "Richard's Round Trees", the only spot in Greensboro, NC where you can find a Christmas Tree in June.

      Sal's Corner  "Potent Rules for the Public Restroom"   When I was little, I didnt use the bathroom NOWHERE but 2830 6th St. One time I held my "peace" all the way from Chester, PA to DC. I would get the secretary at my elementary school to send me home because I had a "headache" but the whole time I need to talk to dat stool. When I got to school my freshman year in college, I found out that many people dont like using other restrooms than their own. One friend said he was holding his until Thanksgiving. I had similar feelings until I ate the waffles in the Cafeteria my first day down there. WOOOO. If you aint had Virginia Hall-Cleveland Hall Breakfast, you aint had your Colon cleansed. Even the thought of that place makes my stomach rumble. So I ate the breakfast in there that day and as soon as I got back to my dorm, I had to hit that commode QUICKLY. I mean my parents hadnt even LEFT yet and I was already getting "adjusted" to college life. But I had RARELY used another stool. So over the last 6 or 7 years I have had to learn the "Potent Rules for the Public Restroom" aka "The 10 CRACK Commandments"   Sidetip: Most of these rules wont apply to urination. We wanna focus more on the other method.   #1 Try not to urinate in a stall right next to another man. Men next to each other in stalls are like men next to each other in the movies. We need space. If its only two urinals, go in a closed stall to urinate.   #2 Teach your son how to urinate with his pants up. I hate coming in the restroom and seeing some 8-year old boy with his pants all the way down to his Jordan's. If he old enough not to be pee'n his pants, he's old enough to aim for the urinal without hitting his slacks.   #3 (Now to the real talk at hand) If you have to "do the number 2", wait till the restroom is empty. If its occupied, act like you came in to check out that bump on your face. Get into the act. Really seem like you are frustrated with that acne problem. As soon as that guy washes his hands (he betta), you take a straight line to the stall.   #4 Space. As in the urinal use, space is needed in stalls. If you have to go in NOW, do that but make some space. I dont like to see somebody's Johnston and Murphy's sliding around next to me.   #5 Dont talk to someone while they are on the stool or while you are on the stool. We all do the number 2 but we act like no one else does but us. We all do but I dont need to know its you. If Im washing my hands and I see your flightposites under that stall I wont even say nothing.   Sidebar: using the restroom in college was tough. Cause all of us DC dudes wore funny shoes. So if Im the only DC dude on that floor, and they see them gold flightposites, the process of elimination is a mutha!   #6 If someone comes in while you are by yourself, halt your process. Nothing is worst than that big "bloop" sound of your turd splashing in the water when another person is in there   #7 Oh did I mention wiping the stool down. Yall just nasty. Yall just gonna let me go thru 6 rules before we mention this one. Paper towels, napkins, tissue, spray.......WHATEVER just wax on and wax off. When I used the dorm restrooms, you'd a thought I was packing for Cancun. I had big boxes and bags wit me going to the restroom.   #8 Wipe till its white. Thats right, dont get up till you done wiped and its bleeding. In African countries, some of the people eat the right foods to the point where they dont need to clean once they had a bowel movement. They just get up. I dont care if I ate 16 Squash and 27 Okra's a day, Im a wipe mines down, ya hear me. Sike naw, clean yourself though. Cause if you go back to your desk and your anal area is feeling like a swamp, you might just have to GO BACK to the restroom.   Sidebar: Fellas, if you married and your wife washes your drawls, dont throw them dirttrack drawls in the laundry. If you caught some of that swamp action earlier in the day, just tell her "Honey I got this load"   #9 Wash your hands. Its just the right thing to do. Ive seen people go in a stall, NO wipe down, no cover.......do the do and walk straight out. I mean first off, you aint even wipe the stool before you sat yout tater on it. Dont yall watch BET? I know I told yall not to watch it a few weeks a go but for GOD's sake, RAP IT UP! Secondly you walk right out and touched the door. Now let me tell yall something. AINT NO USE IN YOU WASHING YOUR HANDS, THROWING THE TOWEL AWAY and THEN TOUCHING THE DOOR. Cause somebody done did the "no wipe no wash" and touched that door and they just erased your whole reason for washing. Just wash your hands, grab a towel and use the towel to open the door. Sorta like opening the oven. Then when you get out the door, put the paper towel in the nearest trash bin.   #10 Act like you aint just dropped a load when you get back to the setting you were in. I know it was times that I been gone so long, my boss think im on a lunch break. If you are at work, go to the snack machine and grab something or come back to your cubicle like you went out of the building for a second and say "Its sure cold outside today". If you in someone else's house just say "You have a nice bathroom, I really like the decorations, I was just in there-a-lookin"    Hey yall, its been fun. Dont try to use none of these rules if im around either. Im a point you out too!  "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"      Interview With Ricardo "Shake em up" Baker  by Salvador Gabor   I recently gotta chance to catch up with one of the major players in the underworld sport of Dice Shooting. This is a sport not shown on ESPN or Comcast Sports or ABC. Its a sport of character, pride, skill and most of all MONEY! This game has been played for decades by drug dealers, pushers, pimps and local neighborhood thoroughbreds that are respected on a citywide and nationwide level.  Ricardo Baker happens to be a top notch "shaker" in this game. "Shake em up" or "Shake em" has been involved in Dice Shooting for quite some time. From the age of 7, back when he was the look out for Police and all the way up to now at 23 where he "Kings" the dice games by when hundreds and thousands of dollars Ricardo has risen up the ranks to be the most deadly man with two to three dice in his hand in all of Uptown D.C and parts of Southwest D.C.    Salvador Gabor: Rick, its good to see you man   Ricardo Baker: Aww man same here, last time I saw ya, you almost knocked over the pile of money I had on the sidewalk   SG: yeah I was going in the store to get some pecan swirls. I aint mean to step over yall game   RB: (Laughs) Yeah I get them pecan swirls sometimes when I know Im a be out slangin these rocks real late.   SG: So first off, how's the arm doing? I heard you had a lil elbow trouble   RB: Its nothing! Doctor said I tore some ligaments in my elbow shooting all them dice. I may need "Tommy John's" Surgery so I can get the "spin" back on my shot. Nahmean! Its nothing though, Still out chere taking all these niggas' money   SG: Ok thats good to here. Whats up for the new Dice "Season"   RB: Manyeah, the weather is breaking so all the players gonna be out, ready to lose that ink! Im taking all money, chains, cars and other valuables. Whatever you wanna put up. 7-11 BABY   SG: You must not lose alot   RB: The nigga wit da money never loses. If you start off wit more money, you should always win. I never come wit less that $5,000. Bet a Thou, Shoot a Thou! How you love dat!   SG: Its been rumored that you are a target for a robbery?   RB: You know Sal, its funny. Thats kinda how I got this elbow injury. Last season I had to knock a nigga out for reaching for his waist. That punch did something to my elbow and HIS JAW TOO. Its a lot of cowards out here. If you bet and you lose, YOU LOSE. And all these sidebetting dudes........they wanna jump in and hop on they man's and em.........I got something for that. Gimme ALL dat money!   SG: You've taken your game nationwide   RB: yeah yeah, All-Star Game in L.A. last week, came home with $10 G's...... NOTHING ......its NOTHING. I was da nigga throwing money in the air down Miami last memorial day, taking $2,000 sidebets. For real man, Im real wit these dice mayne! Had all them pimps and hustlers basically paying for my trip.   SG: Many have said that craps and cee-lo are games full of luck?   RB: Its only two things that you'll be lucky for............1) Lucky to have cab money when I buss your pockets and 2) Lucky I dont make you go to the ATM   SG: In most hoods its customary that you give back some of the money you won if you "break" the game   RB: I mean if da dude is from my hood, YEAH..........but if I dont know da dude im like "get out here doggie" I might give em a "pound" or dap em. "Nice try baby" but you gets no love   SG: Your favorite "Arena" to shoot in   RB: Its a tie, I gotta say 14th & Belmont also Benning Rd. and Minnesota Ave. Belmont because of the crowd. I rise to the occasion, ya know! And over on Benning Rd. cause the dice bounce off the wall outside the carryout a lil better than anywhere else. Kinda like basketball when the rims aint too tight and not too loose.   SG: Have you been training for the season?   RB: oh yeah, BIG Remy bottles, Hydro, a couple of 40's. You always gotta test your stamina and balance. If I can stand up straight after 2 J's of Dro to the head and a 40 then I KNOW I can squat for 4 hours and make a quick $5 G's.   SG: Any words for all the fans who come out to see you play in the summer   RB: Two Words.........GET ME. I need my money, nobody owes me. You know why, cause you dont leave until you pay me. Aint nothing else to say, put your money on the ground and "shake em up"

      Interview with Stanley "Charlie" Pettigay by Salvador Gabor   Every once and a while, a person comes along that changes the game. That person can not be replaced nor can they be underestimated or under-appreciated. When it comes to the Crack Game in D.C. "Charlie" definitely fits that description. Although not known on a national level for his success with selling "buttas", "Charlie" is respected for his contribution to all dope sellers in the D.C. Area   Salvador Gabor: Just be clear, at no point can we use the name Stanley Pettigay.  Charlie: OH naw man. Police is everywhere. Them niggas probably be in the lil window by my shower in the mornin' sometimes. Never can tell  SG: Alright Charlie, tell the world about you and what you've done for the crack game  Charlie: Two words: SEWN UP. I sewed this game up years ago. I done rocked many of blocks across this city. You name it, Ive sold it, you call the place, I've sold it there. Im a true hustler.  SG: What makes your game so top flight?  Charlie: You know a young nigga gotz to keep premium product. Sometimes I let the "headz" test my "work" and they just fall out their chair. I had one dude pass out and his nose bled for 2 days. Now THAT'S some serious "butta" right there!  SG: So where do you get your product from?  Charlie: HOLD HOLD HOLD UP. I thought this was an interview, you not me getting on no stand and testifying! You got the game wrong. I keeps it gangsta!  SG: Speaking of testifying, have you had any legal troubles as of late?  Charlie: Po-Po harasses a nigga all day. But they dont stop my shine. Im like the sun when I hit these bricks. From 6am to 6 Pm Im OUT HERE!  SG: Oh so you do your dealing in the day?  Charlie: MOST DEF, my niggas dont sell dope after night time!  SG: But back to the legal troubles, have you ever done time in jail?  Charlie: Not no real time. I been over the jail for like 30 days but for real, I aint going to jail...........Cause I dont COP to these charges. Niggas be so called gangstas in the street, then cry on the stand. Copping to misdemeanors before the trial even start. NIGGA.........Take it to trial. If you got caught wit a pistol in your Delta 88, take it trial. If they jumped out on you and you tossed the "buttas", take it to trial. I aint NEVA coppin!  SG: What is your main goal?  Charlie: Im not tryna sell dope all my life. I got other things I wanna do........like selling weed! I mean crack is cool but the charges are more serious. I just wanna sell enough crack to save up like about $500,000 and then lay back and pump that good green and chill  SG: Where are you currently pumping your "stones"?  Charlie: Just hit me on my pager. Im everywhere  SG: No No I dont want your crack, I was just asking  Charlie: Oh Ok, cause I was about to say............I got "Buttas" in my drawls right now! Im always ready to serve!  SG: You keep em in your DRAWLS?  Charlie: You can go out there on the pound wit stones in your pocket if you WANT TO! Not the kid. Them feds gonna have to DIG DEEP to get me! Ya Hear ME!  SG: What about the community? Do you feel a certain way about selling drugs to your own people?  Charlie: Yeah I feel a "certain" way. I know its CERTAIN that on the 1st and 15th, the whole Southside is gonna be ROCKIN! Nigga I made $1,500 everyday from the 1st to da 5th this week!  SG: Today is the 5th Charlie! And its only 9:30 A.M.?  Charlie: RIGHT, I was up and out at 6:00 this morning. Nigga, I done rocked off all my 20's and 50 rocks THIS MORNING. You think its a game. D.C aint got nuttin but crackheads! Everybody on "buttas". Yo' Mamma might be on "buttas"  SG: Ok Charlie.........Any last words for the people, especially the kids reading this interview  Charlie: Kids...........dont sell drugs. I wouldnt want you cutting into my money. Cause I dont usually kill 13 years olds but for this dope I'll getchu OUTTA THERE! Holla atcha boy, champ!

      Music News by Salvador Gabor       After 10 years off the scene, Odessa "Juicy" McBride is back with her new album "Can I Tell It?" Originally from Oakland, California, Juicy's new album has a real West Coast Funk to it..........Literally. Inside each of her albums are root-beer flavored air fresheners. She decided to include these air fresheners to bring back the feel that she had as an amateur singer in the Bay Area.  "Juicy" is not the only talent in the McBride family. Her nieces formed a group in the late 80's. Oaktown357 was a group under the tutilege of MC Hammer. There smash hit "Juicy got em crazy" was a dedication to their aunt Odessa. Odessa was quite the Gentlemen's Woman at that time. Men went crazy over here. She was the first person in all of Oakland with a Jheri Curl and looks to apparantly be the LAST person with one as well.   We dont know much about the new album itself. I didnt want to even listen to it after I smelled all that Root Beer. I mean, if yall wanna hear it, you can go buy it. The most interesting thing about "Juicy's" career is that she STILL seems to know where to get Jheri supplies. Thats all for now.   Fashion News by Salvador Gabor     Just an update for all barbers. The Barbers Union of America had retired this style of cut back in 1997. The #3 was officially retired 7 years ago but an amendment was upheld to bring the #3 back. So now that we are throwing back jerseys, songs and shoes, why not hair cuts.   PS, we're not bringing back that party shirt though

      "Ignorant Disdain" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Ignorance is often misinterpreted.  Some people often mistake street-smarts for ignorance, or differing from the status quo as ignorance.  On a serious note there are certain situations when a level of "ignorance" or ignorant Disdain must be preserved.  Follow me if you will.   Conducting business in the street:  This can also be doing business with street people.  The term street people doesnt necessarily refer to niggas selling drugs, but mainly hustlers in general.  If you are in business for yourself you are a hustler.  You must know how to hustle to get a buck and to avoid being bucked out of a buck.  When conducting business with a street person, there is a certain level of ignorant disdain one must uphold.  For instance if you are flagging a taxi, there is no cute way to do it,  get your butt on the curb and be strong and ignorant, use your best outside voice and get that dimesnatcher's attention.   Lines:  Lines are a primary site for "social fair projects"  there is always a white woman that will test you.  We were taught as youngsters to wait patiently in line.  Then as we got older we encounter several things that really test this age-old adage.  The DMV oh this requires patience, whether you need your learner's or hard tags, that "wait patiently" must be on a cigarette break.  Since "Wait patiently" is on break so am I,  the DMV waits for no man.  Patience might have you back later in the week.  I wanna thank the Brentwood Station aka the Old Levi's BBQ for that drive-thru.   Lines continued:  I previously mentioned white women, sometimes women in general, but mainly white women see fit to challenge a nigga such as myself when they are blatantly wrong.  Now they think just because they have a question, or maybe by some grace of the Magical World of Caucazoids, that we wont see them do this "I would like to ask a question".  It is at this point when your ignorance must remain sublime.  If at a department store, kindly hold your desired item in front of the white woman's face aka the Line Stepper and redirect the salesperson (more often is a white woman just as ignorant as the line-stepper, or a minority afraid of what the white person will say).  They ought be afraid of what an "ignorant" black person will do if you dont acknowledge their "patient approach"   Mass Transit:  Depending on the day the level of Ignorance on the train/bus can range from moderate to raging.  There are sometimes chicken bones, McDonalds wrappers and all kinds of other things on the bus.  Loud foreigners and teenage urbanites make their pressure felt on train and bus.  I know for myself Wednesdays are always Wild.  Wild Wednesdays, the train always seems to be packed, and someone feels they are so important that they must get on or navigate by any means necessary.  I once had a young girl, around the age of 15 get real ignorant. she thought a flying bump on a crowded train would move me.  Much to her shagrin, there was only one ignorant nigga on the door at the end.   Ignorance should not be mistaken  especially if rules justify it, and it is not awkwardly blatant  planes, trains, and automboiles can be the setting to say the least  for one calm mofo to unleash the ignorant beast.  reach one teach one,  and if there be 2 people that push past you, then clip each one  there are certain lesson once must learn  hands dipped in wesson by the grill will get u burned.  cut down on the patience and ease your stress,  just let the blackness superceed and the ignorance negress   "Ham Sammich of Love" by Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esquire   Ladies, this one is for you. Take notes, this information will be very useful.   Women, ladies, girls, FEED YOUR MEN.  You've have all heard the saying that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.  THIS IS LAW.  Me personally, I would rather have my lady make me a ham sammich before she gave me some lovin'.  You see ladies, the simple act of making a ham & cheese sammich really shows your man how much you love him.  Combining all those ingredients takes thought and care. The potato bread (either fresh or lightly toasted), the mayonnaise (NOT Miracle Whip), the cheese (Kraft or gubment). A good ham sammich says, "Baby, I love you."  And when I finish a good ham sammich I says, "Man that girl can make a ham sammich, she must her some Gartrelle!"   But it doesn't stop at a ham sammich ladies.  I'm not on some women should be barefoot and pregnant tip, cuz my lady got's to have a J-O-B. Two incomes is a must.  But women's liberation and "I'm a strong Black independent woman" and all of that don't mean y'all can't cook for us no more.  Y'all still want us to give up our seat, hold the door, change you motor oil, cut the grass, etc. All we ask is that the birth the chirrun and cook up some bacon and cheese eggs sometimes.  Now, I understand that nowadays women got careers and work hard just like us men, but how about cooking a meal just 2-3 times a week? Is that too much to ask? I'm not asking you to cook Thanksgiving dinner, but Hot Pockets and Digiorno Pizza just ain't cutting it any more. We left the Top Ramen behind us in the dorm room.  Maybe it should be the fact that you still love/like us despite our dirty socks on the floor or that ring we leave around the bathtub, or the way you help us out when our funds are low, but the way to prove to a man that you love him is too have some mac n' cheese, some greens and T-bone on the table every now and then.   So to all you new millennium ladies, take notes from your mama's and grandmama's. They know how to make a man feel like a man.  It's a shame that when I go to my lady's mama's house for dinner, her mama has to tell her, "Girl, you better make that man a plate."  You see, you young gals don't realize that it doesn't take much to make a man happy.  Give him some lovin' from time to time, let him watch the football game on Sundays in peace, and feed him. It really is as simple as that.  The women of the older generation realized that if you do simple things for us men, you women will get everything you want.  You want a new dress or a new comforter set? Cook your man a hearty meal for a week. You'll be sleeping on 1000 thread count sheets by sunset on Saturday.  You young gals need to take lessons from the older generations. Why you think your grandparents been married for 60 yrs? Because grandpa knew that couldn't nobody put just the right amount of mayo on his ham sammich like your grandma.   Now go on in the kitchen and make your man some scrapple.  Show him how much you care.    and now................   An Announcement from BAULA (Bougie And Uppity Ladies Association)   We, the distinguished ladies of BAULA, are inviting all eligible bachelors to the Annual BAULA "I Need A Man" Reception and Fundraising Event.   The Purpose of this event is to evaluate all potential marriage prospects.  In addition to your invitation, you will need to bring: a government issued ID, your graduate degree, proof of income, deed to your own house(your mama's house is unacceptable), title to your car (must be luxury), and proof of non-paternity.   We, will be walking around with our noses in the air and will give you an ice grill if you try to approach us before we give you the squirrel-eye.   Refreshments will NOT be served because we don't know how to cook and a caterer cost too much. The new line of Louis Vuitton purses and Jimmy Choo's are coming out next week and those are a must.   BAULA is a FOR Profit organization organized to assist siddity gold diggers in their never ending quest for the sanctity and security of marriage, or at least alimony.

      Bidness News by Salvador Gabor  Just a few reminders and tips for today   * You ever had someone look at you and say "That boy gonna be a Cab Driver when he grow up!". Well if thats you, Checker Cab is the place for you. Checker Cab, established in 1952 by Walter Pettigrew is a business dedicated to making a driver outta you! So what, you dont have a license!!!! Who cares if you had a stolen car offense at age 13, Checker Cab NEEDS you! In today's society, we are not raising young men to be cab drivers anymore. Gone are the days where you could flag a cab down in 30 seconds. The cab industry is fading away and Checker Cab is here to hire new interns to roll through the streets. For more info call Walter's son, Emmanuel Pettigrew at (301) 669-7575  * In inner-city bidness news, the Uptown Mutual Corporation of America, has announced that the Hood Mutual Fund interest rate has increased by 2%. Just to give you an idea of how it works........ The "mutual" fund is a "money-pot" that you and a group you choose to go in with put up and transfer to a local hustle-man, in other words "your everyday thief". This money you are giving him ensures that he will steal and rob beyond the money you invested in him. There are two types of  "Hood Mutual Funds". 1) Money Mutual Fund. Your hustle-man will just go out and straight up rob a nigga for his money. Or 2) An Asset Mutual Fund. We dont always need money, sometimes we need TV's, DVD's, and everyday housing products such as lotion, soap detergent and "Comet" so we can scrub dem nasty tubs. Anyways, the rate has gone up 2% meaning that its so wicked in these streets, what $20 used to get you can be got with only $13-17. You can put up less and get the same amount or put up the same amount and get more bang for your buck! Oh yeah the reason why it's called a "Mutual" Fund, well let's just say, I dont wanna get in trouble and he dont wanna get in trouble. All I want is my monies and all HE want is his monies, so the feelings are MUTUAL!  * Always remember for any ads on this site please contact the Womack Family @ 301-455-3534     On today's installment of the Salvador Gabor Project, I had a close friend of mines "remix" my Sal's Corner from a  FEMALE's  perspective..................  "Pottytalk"  The use of the bathroom is an integral part of a young girl’s rite of passage into womanhood. As a young girl we are taught all of the rules: how to use the restroom with a skirt on, which way to wipe, how to flush with our feet and most importantly how to squat.  Young girls learn very early that when you are outside of your momma’s house you betta not get caught with your bottom touching the toilet. All  types of diseases and germs exist out there. I remember being a little girl afraid of what may happen if my mother knew that I had sat on the toilet.  Once, when I had to go really bad, my mother took so long trying to wrap the toilet in layers of tissue, that I almost pooped on myself, which would of been more acceptable than me putting my bare behind on that filthy toilet.  As I grew older, these rules stuck with me. It didn’t matter if I was at Church or at the Doctor’s office, or even at my Uncle’s house. “You don’t know who’s been sitting on that toilet” always repeated in my mind, even when I though it was safe! I only sat on toilet at my mother’s house.   As women, we see things that men don’t see. How many times have we walked into a restroom in which someone’s trifling tail had taken it upon themselves to place their unwrapped feminine hygiene products in the imaginary sanitary receptacle in the corner on the floor.  We see it everyday, a particular type of woman that walks in the restroom and does not bother to wash her hands, yet fiddles with her hair and make up with those same potty hands. Or how many times, have you walked into an empty toilet only to see piles of you name it festering in an open toilet.  There is a such thing as bathroom etiquette and I’m about to break it down.  Rule #1) Ladies, I realize it is the new millennium. A lot of us, are out here raising these boys as single parents. Although I understand that you don’t want to send your son to the bathroom alone, I don’t want no pre teen boy all up in the women’s bathroom. Telling me that I dropped something (my tampon wrapper etc.) . If your male child is older than eight years old, please proceed to the family bathroom.   Rule #2) Pre determine your feminine hygiene products needs. I really don’t want to hear you unwrapping tampons, and removing the sticky tape from those pads. Try not to make make it  so000 obvious that you are using a super long tampon with an extra thin maxi plus pad with wings!  Rule #3) Ladies , if u r at work and you know your about to squeeze some brains out, you must be observant. On your way to the restroom, take a look around. You  see her walking, but is she walking to the restroom too? Be alert. She can sense things. There is nothing like walking in and here comes someone right behind you. Now what u gonna do?   Rule#  4) If you get caught tryin to do # 2. Be cool. Everyone knows that if u were there when they walked in and now they are about to wash their hands and you haven’t moved out the stall… We all know what is up. Be cool, wait until you hear them exit. Make sure the coast is clear. And plan your escape.  Rule #5) If you know you have to go, Please don’t choose the stall closest to the door. Smells float no matter how fast you think you flushed after your release. 	 Rule #6)When you have to do a "number 2" and we all do, Please use a toilet cover  Rule #7) When u r sitting down handling your business, pull your pants up off the floor. Try not to make noises. I know sometimes it hurts but suck it up and push it on out. Hint Hint.  Rule #8) I f you see me standing there tryin to get some soap, please proceed to the next sink. I mean what does it look like, three women tryin to wash their hands under the same faucet?  Rule #9) If you sprinkled the seat a little bit, please be courteous and wipe it up. It is yours you know! Don’t act like your to good to wipe up your own pee. And Don’t assume that it is the janitor’s job to do it either!  Rule 10#) Always, I mean always wash your hands. I know sometimes we just want to check and make sure there is no leakage. Or maybe we just want to de-wedgee. Whateva the case, if you walk in the stall and shut the door , I’m expecting some soap action when you come out that joint.  Until next time ladies. Be Ez.

      Sal's Corner "Character"   Im talking to all my men on this one. Ladies please read anyway because this article will lead you to a good man. Fellas we need "CHARACTER". I know I know, Martin Luther King had character. Malcolm X had character. Even Joe Frazier had character. I mean real dudes. Real men. But that kinda character is good and all but you need a DEEPER "character". For a lack of a better word/phrase, you need just a taste of "nigga" in you. Yes all races of men need that not just African-Americans. See the biggest misconception is that the word "nigga" means black man. It describes a male who is a man but has that inner character of the urban world. I know yall dont quite get it but let me tell you where you can get it.   * The Buffet - See as adults we spend TOO much time in these uppity restaurants. We tryna impress these ladies. Yall need to go to some buffets. Some $8.99 all you can eat spots. Spots where its kids crying, fat people yelling and you can get up and get your own refills.   * The Barbershop - Some of yall go to these barbershops WAY uptown or WAY downtown and go right in and leave right out. The best barbershops are in the HOOD. Go on down to the projects and let em treat you right. The hood barbershop is an urban country club. Fellas you can go in there and talk yo' talk and get things off your chest. I would prefer that if you go in the shop for the FIRST time, it should be in football season, RIGHT after a pay-per-view fight OR right when the summer breaks but they aint put the A/C in the window yet. That heat outside wit no A/C inside makes the wildness JUST right.   * Baptist church - I dont go to a baptist church but every once and a while I might happen to step in one. You need to go to a church where the beat is not made by a drum but by the feet of the congregation. Everybody patting the floor like they marching to zion. You dont need to go to this kind EVERY sunday but just stop in or ride pass and observe the people. You need to look at a 60 year old man wit a top hat on and a red suit. You need to see an old lady wit a purple dress and a lavender squirrel coat to match.   * Motel - Stay in a motel one time. A motel where you still get a key and not some card to slide in the door. A motel where it might be a man who just rented a room to sit in there by himself and watch the game in peace. A motel where the only breakfast in bed is you eating that bacon biscuit from "SONIC".   * The Carryout - Go in there and order something complicated. Something that you dont just walk in and walk out with like 5 wings and fries. Sit down, read the list of neighborhood shout-outs on the wall. Read the writing on the "sweepstakes" boxes on the counter that say "R.I.P. Bay-Bay" or "Lamont & Felecia Forever". Listen to the people who come in the shout their business in the street so effortlessly. People who bang on the glass window hurrying poor "yung lee" to hurry up on their Hamburger Sub. Yall need that!   * People from the country that live in the city - I wouldnt make yall go all the way down south but be around some people from the south in your city. Go to someone's house where the grandmother dont want nobody ironing or washing clothes on Sunday's. Yall know thats the "LAWD's" Day. Go to a house where if grandma curse at least she'll say "Excuse my french". Go to a house where rats, roaches and old uncles are welcome to move in and out and come and go as they please. And you definitely need to go to a house where the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments and joint pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King are posted in the Dining Room.    "Lord Willin, 'Rome Feelin"     Entertainment News by Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esquire   March 1, 2004  9:05 A.M. EST  (AP) Associated Press   Lil' Penny Hardaway Charged With Sexual Assault   Brooklyn, NY- Lil' Penny Hardaway of Nike commercial fame was charged in New York state court with one count of sexual Assault stemming from allegations made by a 22 year old student who works part-time as a Hooter's waitress.   The charges come at a time when Lil' Penny has been out of the spotlight for many years now. He reached the height of his fame in 1995-96 when his basketball shoe hawking commercials were among the most creative around.  People everywhere wanted to "party like Lil' Penny."  Wouldn't you if you got hand out poolside at the Delano with Tyra Banks?   However, things took a turn for the worse when big Penny hurt his knee and moved to Phoenix.  Lil' Penny stayed behind in Orlando to handle some unsuccessful business deals and finish writing his autobiography.  He later joined Big Penny in New York to experience life in the Big Apple.   Its seems that the Big Apple was to big for Lil' Penny. He turned to drinking and gambling.  Also there was a new "Lil" on the scene making Sprite commercials and stealing his fading shine. Witnesses say that one night at the Times Square Hooters, Lil Penny met an unnamed waitress and took her back to Big Penny's condo where the alleged Assault occurred.   Lil' Penny released this statement: "I would like to say that I'm totally innocent of the charges. Everyone that knows me knows that i would never do such a thing and these allegations baseless and merely an attempt to assassinate my character and achieve financial gain. I appreciate the support from all my fans and all the "Lil's" of the world. Thank you. Oh yeah, party tonight and Marbury's crib."   Lil' Penny will be arraigned Monday morning.  It doesn't look good for the lil' guy...

      "The Underworld that is Metro" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  I often notice certain things while on the Metro.  Some good some bad, some just down right hivarious.  Today we will look at Metro's Comfort Zone, and the Attention Seekers.  Follow me if you will, watch out for that gum, dont wanna mess your shoes.   It is a psychological fact that people have Comfort Zones, i.e. personal space.  We as black people (mixed, and pigmently challenged folks learn something) dont like people we dont know, and some people we do know too close to us.  If we are carrying on a convo, that doesnt mean you need to be 3 feet in front of me.  Back up and project your voice, if your throat hurts...email me.   In certain situations our Comfort Zone's change, for instance when we are on the train our Comfort Zone changes.  I may change from 5-8 feet to "as long as this nigga dont bump me with this rolling backpack" or "as long this niggas hand dont touch mine while I am holding the rail".  However just because the Comfort Zone gets smaller, that does not entitle folks to certain privileges.   Dont stand real close to me if the train aint crowded, there is just no cause for this.  I'm jive a big dude, but I dont take up 2 seats, so if you plan on sitting next to me, angle your butt so it doesnt hit my shoulder, thank you.  People who wedge themselves, dont sit so close to the wedged person that you look intimately close, respect the rules of the Underworld, and scoot yourself.  Big people, Big people, where do I begin, you know like I know alot of you need a seat to yourself.  If this were United Airlines you would pay a double-fare.  Dont think to sit next to an above-average sized person.  You better stand and suffer!   Attention Seekers:  You people with your walkmen too loud.  you know who you are.  Now most attention seekers are teenagers, or big women, or DC Government workers.  Big women just on there running their mouth talking about gossip, what happened on American Idol, or their love life.  I dont need to hear that before 10am.   DC Government workers, especially Library of Congress, talk about the job-site.  Oh and they use profanity, a ride next to them will definitely enlighten you on office ongoings with this Negrographic Narratives.   Teenagers:  I know the youth need attention, but young fellas stop all this dancing on the train.  I am only 24, but when I was coming up, young niggas werent doing all this dancing.  All that "beating-your-feet" is not appropriate.  When we were coming up, we just cussed on the train, or felt up the young ladies, but all this dancing, and female profanity is setting a bad base for the adolescents.   The train is a secret society with it's own rules and regulations, different social classes, and guilds.  There is always something to behold on the red, blue, green or gold.  Watch your step when it is wet and cold,  especially when it's hot and the pre-teens are so bold,  cussing around ladies so old.  Understand the train and it's caste system,  but dont run for the train in that cast sista,  Aint nothing cute about bad train behavior,  whether it be a trip, slip or booger in your nose, nothing can save ya.     Auto Report  by Salvador Gabor  In September of 2003, the 2004 Models came out for us to gasp in amazement about. Cars such as the 2004 BMW 745 il, The 2004 Cadillac Escalade, the 2004 Mercedes Benz Maybach, and several other cars of this magnitude. Even if you are not looking in a magazine, at a music video or outside a club, you are STILL bound to see these cars. The bad thing about them is that they are expensive and although they are pricey, it may be hard to purchase a car like this because of the limited stock (in the case of the Maybach). We here at the Salvador Gabor Project encourage individuality, uniqueness and the broadening of horizons. Who needs an Escalade when you have this...........     Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, I present the 1987 Ford Econoline. What nigga can get wit you if you pull up to the club with this. This is the ULTIMATE in Country/Over 60/AAU Basketball Luxury. Coaches, Old men who take people home at the grocery store and women who serve in the Church's Sick & Shut-in Ministry would LOVE to have one of these.  The Ford Econoline is a state of the art fully-loaded Van, suitable for an age and sits up to 7 Adults. Have you ever sat on the third row of a van, eating mashed up peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (You know.........the kind that sticks to the roof of your mouth), a pack of pecan swirls and an orange soda (no not Sunkist but Fanta!)? Or how about some good home-cooked fish with a jug of hot sauce from Murry's? This is good eating and good traveling that can only be experienced in a 1987 Ford Econoline.   This Van does not have leather seats. FOR WHAT? So you can hop in on a hot day and be stuck to the seat! There is a nice suedish cloth to lay upon while driving or riding. Shoot, for $3,995, you cant beat that. Also, there is a 3 X 5 Television mounted in the top of the van. Now if you are driving through areas such as Gaston, NC you may not get good reception but thats ok dont worry about that at all. Also there is a tape player. The van comes with complimentary tapes from artists such as Al Green, Johhnie Taylor and gospel group.....The Canton Spirituals.   Lenny & Cat-Eye's Auto Driver rank this vehicle as the best Van for under $4,000. I dont see a better $4,000 investment than this. And if you act now, you have and unlimited warranty covered by "Basehead Bill" who is the grease monkey mechanic over on 58th & Blaine streets in N.E. He will fix anything wrong with this car for $10. You know niggas gotta get high mayne!

      Commentary By Salvador Gabor   "Book Smarts"    How much is book smarts really worth nowadays? Just to take a piece from Reggie's article yesterday..........to realize the value of an education, dont ask the girl who got a 4-year degree and is now a receptionist. It's weird how the cards fall. You go to college. You get good grades while you are in college. You are recruited by major corporations because of your performance while in college. A company hires you and gives you a signing bonus. ALL of this only to let you go 6 months later with a severance package because some lying accountant in the company took money and the value of the whole company plummets, leaving you in the cold. Its crazy when you get a degree in something like Sociology and you get out in the world and for some reason websites like Monster.com and USAJobs.com are looking for sociologists??? Go figure. But what leads people to disasters like this?     The biggest misconception is that "this field pays big money"! First off let me say that NO amount of money can make you happy. I couldnt be a mortician or a caretaker of a dead body. Its just not in me. Money pays bills but if you dont want to wake up and go to that job, the money will soon lose its value. But beyond the money aspect, picking a field because that field is considered to be good is a major misconception. 9 times out of 10, the major fields will be flooded with people JUST like you or better than you at what it is you have learned in that field. If everyone has a degree dealing with Computers, its gonna be much harder for you to get a job dealing with computers. Go with what you really enjoy. Even if its basketweaving, SO WHAT! If you love basketweaving, you will work to become the BEST basketweaver because you enjoy doing it. Yeah every basketweaver doesnt become a millionaire but if you like it THAT much you can be the next Martha Stewart............well........ you wouldnt wanna be  exactly  like her.      Your life as an adult starts much earlier than you think. Most of us get dropped off at college at the age of 18 and your parent say "I'll be back to pick you up in about 4 years". We go and unpack our bags and we register. We pick any ole major because thats just how we felt on the day of registration. In my own example, I was stuck between Marketing and Accounting. I ended up picking Accounting because I felt that with Marketing, sometimes you had to "lie" to consumers and I wasn't down with that. Me not knowing any better, I felt I was doing the "right" thing. Almost 7 years later now I know that with Marketing/Advertising you dont have to lie. Actually the creativity that we display on this site can be accredited to our keen sense of Marketing and knowing what drives people. What makes them tick. What stands out to a person. And most importantly, what they want and how they feel. Im not saying that Accounting aint for me at all. If I have to have an "office job", this is what I want to do. But there is a creative side of me that wants to make commercials, do a movie or turn this site into a magazine. Its a shame we have to choose our lives at 18. Who knows what would have happened had I not scratched out Marketing on my registration card?????      Is college really the promise land? Sometimes I challenge that theory. You know about 10 years ago, I began to hear alot of the old folks say "Son go to college and get an education, without that degree you cant get no job!". 10 years later many of us have these degrees and dont have jobs or we have under-paying jobs???? What's funny is that when that old-timer tells you that, for some strange reason I believe you werent the ONLY person he told that too. Someone else heard that speech as well and they definitely hopped on that word of advice. Now EVERYONE is in or has went to college. And what does this mean for our world? College is like a machine. We are the product. It's an assembly line process. Every year Hundreds of Thousands of Kids get degrees and they all are going for the same job. SO I wonder, will there be a point where there are just NOT enough "office jobs"? The point has already come where your Bachelor's Degree has lost valued. Now you need a Ph.D to get a regular "office job". But really, for those of you not making alot of money at your job after going to college, ask yourself a question. What if you just worked from 18-22? Lets say as an electrician? You saved your doe and invested it right? Buy the time you are 23-25, you could be well on your way to having your own electrical company. Although it may be small, its YOURS. Its an accomplishment. At 25 you could be established, whereas now at 25 most of us college grads are still lost. Its just a thought. I've seen many people make it without degrees. You can make $75K- $100K cutting hair for a living. Its POSSIBLE. College is for people who either dont know what they want to do or need a 4-year certification in order to complete the requirements for their field. If you really want to be an electrician, take the 6 month course and get it in. You save 3 and 1/2 years and about $55,000 in the process.  Many of us go to college because we want to impress others. I had a female once tell me........."I want a man who has a 'professional' job. So when we go to Black Tie Affairs, he's not saying 'I cut hair for a living' or 'I pick up trash for a living' ".  What's so crazy is that she was adamant about that!! But i'd rather smell like boneless fish from picking up trash all day with $100,000 in my bank account than have some tie and tight slacks on with no ink to spare. All I'm saying is know your options.      Life is about exposure. Just to take you guys back to an example of my own. I loved Accounting. I loved it when I was young because I was good with numbers. I remember having a project in the 6th grade and my teacher gave us like $3,000 to work with in order to get on our feet as adults. She gave us newspapers and magazines to order furniture, computer equipment or whatever we felt we needed from the beginning. Me being the "nigga" that I am, I spent my whole 3 G's on suits. In my mind I was like "This is how I need to start off!". But seriously, my mindset was that way because when I saw Accountants, I saw nice suits. I saw a person that people trust their money with. I saw a person who controls the lives of many people. I wanted to be that person. I took Accounting classes in High School and aced them. It just got to a point in my grade school career that Business oriented classes were all that I was exposed to. I wonder sometimes, "What if I knew what engineers did back then?". "I never knew you could do this or that with Architecture?". The point being, if you are a parent, what is your child being exposed to? Most kids wanna be police officers, athletes and doctors because growing up leads you to see those occupations the most. Dont ask your kid what he or she wants to be, take them out to different places and let them SEE what it is they want to be. If you pay attention to your child (as you should be), what they are best at will come out. What they like and tend to do better in will come out. Writing and humor has been in my blood since I was young. I always wrote and I always like to laugh and joke. I just never had someone tell me that I could make a living from it. Dont let your kid grow up saying "If I had known?" And more importantly, dont let your kid grow up to say "Welcome to Days Inn" after you spent $60,000 on a Business Management degree.

      Spring and Summertime in The Hood  by Salvador Gabor  The weather is breaking. I just wanted to make sure everyone knew that and that everyone is aware of the Hood Spring Time. See in D.C., the spring is known for Cherry Blossoms and stuff like that. In the hood its a lil different. Let me point out some things you can look forward to if you spend your spring and summer in the hood  * Expect Cognac! The next few months will see an increase in public cognac consumption. All the old heads will be in the street, with their car doors open pumpin some ole skool and grooving. Usually they dont start till about 5:00 in the afternoon  * Expect late church services. Dont it seem like church only have late services when its NICE outside. Lil kids be MAD that they in there at 4:30 on a Saturday  * Expect White Shoes. Not Diadora's or Air Force One's. Although they will be prevalent, im speaking on the White Dress Shoes. Hispanic Women and African-American men over 52 will have on White Shoes. Especially on the weekend.  * Expect girls to be pregnant. All that "creeping" you did in the winter will be poking out yo' belly in the spring. Believe that. Whether you was "Snowed-In" or "Hoed-In" it will be SHOW-IN!  * Expect the class of 2004. No not the graduates from High School/College. Im talking bout Niggas coming home from jail. Especially them dudes that still think its '91 out here on these streets  * Expect the electric slide. "And you know its there.......here there and everywhere!" I dont think 2004 is the year that we will be able to retire this one people. Its still moving strong  * Expect Big Coats. As the spring turns to summer some brothers cant give up their coats. It can be the middle of July and if it rains hard enough, the Eddie Bauer and NorthFace Parkas come back out for some reason.   * Expect Fake Designer Clothes. Yall remember when the whole hood had fake Iceberg "Snoopy" shirts? Maybe that was just my hood. Or the gucci buckets wit the Q's on em? How bout the versace tennis shoes with Uncle Ben's face on it instead of the Medusa Head? Street Retailers will be on the loose this upcoming summertime/springtime  * Expect Church Fundraisers/Awareness. The Spring is when all the religions go in FULL MODE. Muslims selling Bean Pies and Papers. Christians selling Chicken and Katydids and of course..........the Jehovah's Witnesses are playing the ATF role. The knock down your door like the DEA. You'd think you had a Kilo of cocaine in your house on a hot saturday morning.   * Expect it to be COLD again before it stays hot. For all yall fools who had on Tank-Tops and T-Shirts this weekend and now you got on COATS........and you snifflin'............thats what you get!    Get ready, that time is coming. We here at the Salvador Gabor project will do some "interviews" with Grass Cutters, Car Washes and Mechanics............ALL who dib and dab in the hood. These are key members of the hood during this spring/summer time. Get ready cause we are.

      Sal's Corner "Chuuch"  I love church. I think the idea of gathering with those who believe in what you believe is essential to successful living. Its one thing to watch a game by yourself, but when you can watch it with friends who root for the same team its better. What's EVEN better is when you GO to the game WITH friends who enjoy the sport as much as you do. As is the same for church. Although church should not be taken as a game or as a sport, to be able to fellowship with those who believe as you do can be a blessing. But I want to talk about the GOOD AND the BAD things about church as we know it. Let's be clear on one thing though, this article is NOT about spirituality. This article is about church. Some dont realize that there is a difference. Spirituality is how you live, whereas church is the ritual that you partake in religiously. Im also looking at the idea of church from a lighter/humorous perspective so please dont take offense.  The BAD things about church:  *  The Week Before . You know when you go to church what you've done the week before can do you in that Sunday. Even the NIGHT before on Saturday could hurt you. Sometimes you might have done something so bad that you cant even see going into church with a guilty conscience.   Solution: No matter what though, go ahead in there. PERIOD. Everyone is struggling with SOMETHING. No one is "Holier than thou" so work towards being where you should be with your relationship with God.  *  The Offering.  The offering is NOT bad. I believe you should give an offering and tithe as well. I just think it should be done differently. Like, we should be able to pay from home. Or when we first get in the building. 'Cause when the pastor starts reading the announcements and you know its getting towards the offering. AT that point, all the big timers start pulling out wads and you look like you about to go catch the bus with all that change you have.  Solution: Even if you got 35 cents. Let that change drop in that bucket and make it as loud as possible. So what you dont have $20 to give. So what your money makes noise when it goes in. Aint that what Jesus said to do? MAKE A JOYFUL NOISE.  *  The "Double Clap".  Everybody likes to get their jam on, and their praise on. Thats cool. But some of yall be tryna be too fancy. Sometimes I think yall might be getting your moves from the club. But that "Double Clap" can throw some of us off. Most women can do the "Double Clap". Its the men who mess it up. You ever seen a 60-year old man try to double-up on the clap? Its NOT pretty. Old men have a hard enough time keeping up with the rhythm ANYWAY. Then they look over and see Sister Ragsdale dropping in a "Double Clap" and he thinks HE can do it too!  Solution: If you dont have Rhythm, just lift up both hands and look up. That seems to always help?????  *  Attire.  Ok I have a serious "Bone" to pick with this subject. Prime example...........YESTERDAY. I didnt feel like dressing up. So I had my New Balance on, White Tee, Zip-up Sweater/Jacket and a pair of jeans. Ironed, cleaned and neat. Wouldnt appear to be a problem now would it? I get to church yesterday and I noticed that some people looked at me like I was crazy. Now I dress down every once in a while so I dont think its that much of a shocker BUT I had people responding REALLY different. Had people asking "Where have you been?" and "Its been a long time since I've seen you". I was like "IVE BEEN HERE EVERY WEEK!" They act like when you come in with "regular" clothes on that you've been out in the street on dope. People were looking at me SO funny that I had to ask myself  "DO I look like I've been on that D????"   Solution: Understand that no one is perfect. Even though someone may know the bible back and forth like the back of their hand, we ALL are human. And our human element comes out. They see you with "regular" clothes and their human mentality thinks "He/She is in the street now".    The GOOD things about church:   *  Love . No where have I found as much genuine love as in church. People greet you with a smile, you get hugs and encouragement from people you may not even know! Its truly a good feeling when you can go to a "real" loving church and receive love from people. It makes you feel that the world aint completely bad after all  *  The Women . NO NO NO, see im not even thinking that deep into it. So before you think the wrong thing let me go in detail about what I mean. Going to church and seeing beautiful women lets me know that there are some women left that are fit to be wives. Not saying that because a woman is in church, she is gonna be perfect but at least she has her mind on the Lord.   *  Growth . Looking at where you've been and where you are going and being able to give thanks to God for where he has brought you in this lifetime is good. Sometimes we pray for what we want but never stop to just say thanks. You aint gotta say a 30 minute prayer. But when you go to church, often times you think about that car that coulda hit you this week or that person who hooked you up with an extra wing at the carryout or that man who passed you his transfer on the bus through the window so you could get on the bus free. That makes you look to the sky and just say "Thanks God". If we would just thank him for what he's done, all the other things we need would come much easier  *  Passing on Knowledge.  Its been times in my life where someone like a close friend has been down or discouraged and I had nothing to say in my mind to solve or help their problem. Many times a message from church popped up in my head and I said exactly that to help my friend in need. Take the time and listen to whats being said and apply it to your life. When you continue to hear whats being said from God, you can help others in their life.    Just remember, no matter what life is a walk. Sometimes you stumble and EVEN fall. Just keep one foot in front of the other........."CHUUUCH"     Groundhog Days by Reggie Dinkins Jr.  Many people, mainly those from the Magical World of Caucazoids, tend to believe in pointless days, and creatures with fictional powers.  A prime example is Groundhog Day, these people (present reading company included or excluded depending upon your belief) think some fat furry aminal is going to forecast the weather.  Not a chance, you can have Puxatauny, around here I have my own methods.   There are certain days between February and April when you can tell the weather is going to be real nice.  Sometimes it is the obvious 65 degrees on your morning tv, or 5 real pretty girls on the train.  There are certain types of people that let you know the weather is bout to break and that your Friday may be wild, like crazy young Kindergartener who should be a rittalin-child.  I like to call these people Groundhogs.  Take a trip with me if you will.   Groundhogs come in many different varieties.  Like that variety pack of chips your mother would buy, some good some bad.  A groundhog could be a bunch of good-looking girls in a 4 by 75 foot space, better known as a Metrocar.  Speaking of the train, there are many groundhogs who lay in wait here.  You got that guy who gets on who doesnt look like he should be up this early wearing a Coca-Cola shirt.  Lemme really break this down for you, here is a list of groundhogs.   *Older guys in Salem and or Newport t-shirts   *A special panel of people on smoke breaks, there are people that are always out there, but you never see them together, but they unite and indulge in "Cigarette Philosophy"   *Somebody wearing a cheap-fur in mid-morning.   *Niggas in jackets with sports teams on them, but the jackets are from 95 or earlier.   *People who smell of beer in public.   *A woman with a new hair color, she trying to get right for that weather.   *Fat people moving too quickly, this always lets you know something has gone awry.   *Co-workers in public: a strange dude walking with 1 or 2 foxy ladies, in their "I shouldnt wear this to the office" clothes   * Now this one is relatively new : Niggas in suspenders without their jackets.   *Old lady in green stockings, u know she working a desk job.   *Old dudes that break out the checker boards   *You see your neighborhood alley mechanic at work   *Ladies with bad low-haircuts, i mean bad.   *People with gold-toofus.  The gold-toofus is way more noticable in warm climate.   There are many types of Groundhogs, sometimes it is just a look in a person's eye, a velcro strap will do it.  There are many little things that go unoticed, such as a funny cough, or a cigarette behind the ear, or too many people in the cleaners, especially a black-owned cleaners.  Keep an eye out for the Groundhogs, otherwise you might be wearing that leather when a windbreaker will do.   This is a reminder from the NNCG, Neighborhood Niggas Cutting Grass.  Please tip your neighborhood nigga cutting grass, because we gotta pay somebody to use their edger.  This aint Chemlawn, its Themlawn.  We just be cutting Themlawns, and edging is extra.

      "From the Back" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  This position is often looked down upon by most of society.  Many years ago this is the position that our people were used to.  They got tired of having it from the back, and chose to do otherwise.  Me personally I would rather give it to you from the back, but that is just me.  It is thought that being in the back is a place for followers, and one can't lead from behind.  Oh but you can, you can guide and steer it just the way you want to, definitely make an impression, you can very well control the situation from behind.   I never felt that one learns more from sitting up front in class determines your learning capabilty.  A stereotype to say the least.  If you could learn by absorbing, this nigga here would be a genius after riding that crowded train this morning.  If that foreigner teaching your math class doesnt make sense from 25 feet, I definitely wont be able to translate that 'Ghanistan from 5 feet.  It has been my pleasure to sit at the back of the class, and learn what I can From the Back.   I find it funny to let an unknowing person stereotype me, in most cases they are females.  They do it, not knowing that I know that they have done it.  They see me come in go immediately to the back, probablly toting just a notebook.  Silly rabbits tricks are for pimps.  Instructor gets to talking, a brother chimes in, next thing you know the instructor is talking to me.  Nodding his head waiting for my approval after every key point.  It's good to see control gained from the back, while everyone in front of you has to turn around to understand what is going on.  The whole time, they just getting took from the back.   Interview with James "Bunkie" Diggs by Salvador Gabor      James "Bunkie" Diggs was raised on the Southeast streets of Washington, D.C.. A pimp from birth, James was nicknamed "Bunkie" cause he bunked up with ALL the ladies! "Ladies Love Bunkie" is the phrase that was used in the early days of the bunkmaster we know as James Diggs. I gotta chance to sit down with "Bunkie".   SG: BUNKIE! What it is playa?  Bunkie: It aint easy mayne! I say it sho' aint easy boss playa!!!  SG: I know your time is very valuable but I wanted to talk with you for a second  Bunkie: Yeah man. my lil lady friend told me you were doing a website. She works down at the Department of Justice. I picked her up one day and she called me in the building. I was like "Baby, I dont wanna meet yo' co-workers. They see you wit a fine nigga like mineself and you might get fired". But all she really wanted was for me to see your site. It was good too!  SG: Thanks Bunkie!!!  Bunkie: Yeah man if you see that ole Ricardo Baker, tell that nigga, LET the DICE hit da FLO' mayne! Thats all he gots to do!   SG: So what are you doing with yourself these days?  Bunkie: Its what im doing to these la-dies big dog! Im turning they minds out. Im on the silver screen, the rest of these niggas is on 13 inch hand held TV's!!!! All Staticky! Im clear cut and its gonna cost ya $9.50 every time you come see me!  SG: I hear that. But I mean as far as an occupation. A job. A career. Any goals?  Bunkie: (slight laughter)........Didnt I say my woman works at the Department of Justice? I thought I did? SHE has the job. SHE has the occupation. SHE has the career. Im the one with the goals. She's just my goaltender. I tell her hold on to these ideas while I hold on to your monies. Dig if you will this picture............Imagine me, working a job. Getting paid every other week. Waking up everyday at 6:30 in the morning. Walking around in my Short-Sleeve dress shirt and a Polka-Dot tie. Can you imagine that?  SG: Yeah I can Bunkie.  Bunkie: Well keep on, cause a nigga like me is way too fly for that boxed in job. Niggas like that put the corners in squares!  SG: So you're telling me all you do is chase women?  Bunkie: Dogs chase Sal. DOGS CHASE SAL. I dont think you hear me........DOGS CHASE SAL. Im not a dog!! By no means, shape or form bossman!!! I pick em up like a groundball on smooth turf. My glove is my mouth. My throw is my mind. Once you fall for this glove, the throw is gonna get you out at first. Then when I pull out my bat..........its a home run. Then I tell her, "Baby here's some tabacco. You gonna need that nicotine!"   SG: Interesting. Very interesting. What kinda woman do you like  Bunkie: I used to like larger women. I figured a large woman had to eat. So she had to have money. I just couldnt deal wit dem no more. Plus I didnt like them black marks on they cheeks or that drooping over the elbows. But now Im into smaller women. Working women.  SG: Where do you see yourself in 10 years?  Bunkie: I might settle down. Go on and retire from this pimpin, gigalo'n and runnin around. I might have me a son or two. Who knows. I was thinking about starting me a clothing line. "Bunkie's Boutique"  SG: Sounds nice!  Bunkie: Yeah I've seen a few stores I liked..... Oaktree, Cavalier, Lim's even a few suits I've seen in Dillard's were nice. None of em would have a dime on "Bunkie's Boutique" though.  SG: Im glad to see you wanna go places.  Bunkie: Speaking of going places. Me and Lucrinda was supposed to go up to the Crab house on Eastern Ave. and get some clams and oysters...........Matter of fact she paging me now. Let me run over to this here payphone.

      "March Madness Selective Show" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   It is well into March, and March Madness has begun.  For those of you not quite aware of what I mean.  March Madness beginning those warm days prior to spring springing.  People start acting wild, and the characters come out, and character comes out.  Some people seem to think that we characters care if they come out.  Let's be selective with our March Madness, but not too selective. Selective traits are oftentimes needed to mentally get thru the day, but sometimes they are unecessary. Pull up a chair, get your fill and enjoy some of this Knowledge Pot-Liquor.   Selective Hearing:  Now we all use this.  You know when that homeless guy, with the wad of cash, is trying to get your attention.  This is primetime for Selective Hearing.  Or when that group of big girls thinks she is flirting, but is really harrassing a young brother, Selective Hearing should be used after the 2nd and or 3rd comment.  Depending on whether or not they have been drinking, and how many there are, buffalo travel by the herd.  However all these self-proclaimed divas, who think that just because they took Palottis since November they think they dont have to oblige a man asking for directions on the street.  Not a time for Selective Hearing.   Selective Memory:  The people in this bracket are funny.  This is another tactic ployed by those self-proclaimed divas.  Now self-proclaimed divas, dont always look good, and are often big lonely women who think they are part-time psychologists, relationship experts, poets, and all things refined.  They like to see people in public places, and either not speak, or act like yall didnt cheat on Accounting Tests together.  All that "oh hey, whats your name...dont I know you"  yeah you knew my name real well when you thought I had that stolen test.  Now selective memory in these situations is never really good, but there is a difference when a woman selective remembers a man for whatever reason: they used to be involved, he wanted to involve her, she wanted him to be involved, what have you.  But when 2 women attempt to use selective memory with one another, it just makes for one big commotion of fake-laughing a bunch of "ok's", "I'll call you" and otherwise unecessary BS.  This is usually followed by a profanity-filled statement or two.  Just waive and keep it moving.   Selective Learning:  This is usually a trait embraced by "suckers for love".  Brothers who think if they keep giving her their money she will treat you differently, not a chance.  Sisters who think if they take him back this one more time he will stop spending your money on that "white woman".  Learn yourself something, if she just wants you for your money put her out in front of an ATM, and they will be happy together; send the brother to rehab or just drop him down Kennedy Street, there is plenty of "white womans" down there.   There is nothing wrong with being selective, but when you start acting selective that brings about falsified traits.  Fortify your being with select choices and not selective selectiveness just for the sake selecting some new thing to get someone to select you.  Select is somewhere between the direction and right before start, so before you play the game, make sure you got the right number.  If you know how to play the game, you dont even need to use select.    "Auto Report" by Salvador Gabor      Before the Cadillac EXT, there was the El Camino. The first EVER luxury pick-up of its kind. What other car do you know that can suffice the duty of taking out a date AND moving some bulk furniture at the same time?????? The El Camino is a 2-seater that is cozy enough for a couple yet sturdy enough for an old coach with ripped up plastic on it.  El Camino's are not seen alot on the street nowadays. People have become "too fancy" for this pickup-car. Yet with the resurgence of pickups being in fashion, the El Camino is bound to make a comeback. Priced at $1,300, this ride isnt a bad purchase. If you dont mind, scrolling across the radio dial and hearing the profanity from the CB walkie/talkie that comes standard in these vehicles, then this is the car for you. When you go outta town, who needs a hotel. Just lay you a spread out on the back and you got a nice sleep ahead of you.   For more info on El Camino's or cars of its kind, Contact  Martin's Cars & Cognac . Located on 2200 Larchmont Ave. in Capitol Heights, MD. The number over there is (301) 782-4698. Ask for Aston or Remy.

      "Negresscent Sports" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Today we take a look back at some champions of nigga's past. Jimmithy Lancaster a native Washingtonian grew up in Edgewood Terrace. He is a somewhat chubby fellow, his mother however insists he is "stout, robust, just a little husky". Despite his 5'10 260lb frame Jimmithy would become on of the finest Dodgeball Players to hit the City Circuit in some time.    Jimmithy was not blessed with the greatest throwing arm and he found himself unable to play end. End is the striking position one that most big guys play, in which the end attempts to hit scatmen with the ball. However, unlike most big guys his age Jimmithy was ELUSIVE!   Jimmithy had more moves than Gale Sayers, and had more agility than a puma! He proved to be one tuff hombre in the 1996 season. Jimmithy was the lead scatman for his 12 and under team for Kingman Recreational Center. He declined offers to play for Turkey Thicket Rec. becasue they only wanted him as at End.   Jimmithy honed his skills in the doorways and halls of Edgewood! he would often dodge basketballs thrown at him by neighborhors to sharpen his tacitcs. He was a crafty nigga to say the least. He always wore medium jerseys to erase any doubt that he had been nooked (hit with the ball). He received several bad calls being so portly, his coach the legendary Duke "Otter" Reid advised him to be proud of his bigness and use it to his advantage.   One game versus the cross town rival Stanton Terrace Stallions. Jimmithy recorded a record 55 wouldas(woulda gotten hit had he not faked them out). Boy he extended many matches in his day, but this one lasted a record 15mins. 15mins for a 12-and-under Dodgeball game is unheard of. Adult matches often range from 10-12mins on average. That boy could move like a sneeze in the wind, like Magic on a fastbreak, like Duffy Rollark in a Brazilian foxhole......The nigga was good!   He was unseen, a freak nature at 12 yrs old, he jumped to semi-pro at age 13 and 275lbs, he gave these 18-24yr olds all they could handle. trying to nook him was like trying to catch a greased midget in August. He went to the pros in 1999 at 298lbs, and has takenover. He is a perrenial starter for the Ivy City Running Rebels! Northeast hasnt seen a finer athlete. He's better than John Battle and Michael Tucker, today we celebrate a great one Jimmithy Lancaster, his legend grows with his appetite!    Business News by Salvador Gabor   In the automobile industry, General Motors has run into a possible problem with some of their 2004 Models. There is a possibility of transmission failure in their full-size pickup trucks, SUV's and vans. The estimated number of vehicles affected by this failure is estimated to be around 8,000. GM has requested that dealers not sell or deliver more vehicles from their Willow Run Plant until each vehicle has been inspected. Although these precautions are being made, GM has reassured that the problem does not pose a safety issue.  The cause of the possible transmission failure is due to a faulty pump within the transmission system. These faulty pumps may prevent lubrication from reaching the overdrive gearset bearing. Although 8,000 is a rough estimate of the faulty vehicles, Spokeswoman Debbie Frank says that about 25,000 vehicles are at some risk. Some of the more popular vehicles on this list are the Yukon XL, GMC Surburban and the Sierra. These additional 17,000 vehicles in risk were in transit between assembly plants and dealers when the problem was discovered.   As a precautionary measure, GM automobile owners are being instructed to use the third gear instead of overdrive until their vehicle has been inspected. The inspection is free and can be done at a dealership service center. GM is also contacting vehicle owners and informing them via phone and letters. This situation should not be mistaken for a recall, because this is not a safety issue.  In other GM News, GM is recalling 93,572 Oldsmobile Aurora sedans. The Federal Gov't reported that fuel from these sedans can leak into the engine causing flames. 123 complaints have been filed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It has been reported that the fuel is leaking due to the degrading and cracking of the nylon tubing used in the fuel rail.

      "A Ghetto Vet" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Today's focus is on a nigga for sure.  As a servant to his community and his country, Duffy Rollark embodies the the term "Ghetto Veteran". Rollark often refered to as "Sarge", leaving one to think he was a Sargeant in the Army, but he wears a Marines jacket with Lieutenant embroidered and "Rollark".  However, it is known that Duffy fought in Vietnam at the Chateau Brióne in Vietnam circa '1974.   Sarge is a pillar of his community.  He can be found strolling Minnesota Ave during the day, and patrolling it's alleyways at night.  A Ghetto Vet in every sense of the word, Rollark, knew where all the "fox-holes", muddy-spots, and herbal terrain, spanning a 5-mile radius.  It was a known alley-folklore that Sarge killed 5 Charlie's with his bear-hands while at the Chateau Brióne.  It was also known that the nigga had been hit in the head prior to and during his stint in Vietnam.   Sarge continued his military tactics when he returned from Vietnam in '85.  Now we know the war was well over by that time, but it is said that Sarge vacationed for a few years after it was all over.  Rollark would often black his face to go and buy "medicine" for his chronic case of jungle.  He once scared the 2-time Hustler of the Week (August '94, and May '96) Jermaine Cheaney, one Thursday evening.  Rollark jumped out the bush and rolled over a parked car with his 12 gauge cradled, and kindly asked Cheaney for a 50-sack.  Needless to say this left Cheaney a bit shellshocked, and was later quoted on Benning Road "man I thought it was the Abominable Nigga that killed them people up the Langston, man I liked to got teary-eyed".   Sarge once led a Re-con mission to Aquatic Gardens, because he overheard a buddy of his placing a carryout order to a friend's house on Quarles Street.  Duffy Rollark went unseen in a snorkel, black face paint, and some cut-up jean shorts, toting his gauge down to Aquatic Gardens.  A man of few words, Duffy was heard mumbling this in between Mayfair and Paradise.. "them gooks keep marchin tru my hood hoorah hoorah, them gooks keep marchin tru my hood, im gonna dance on their face and piss down they chimmney, is that you Colonel...." Duffy Rollark a Ghetto Vet.    Announcement: I (Reggie Dinkins, Jr) will be down Hooters today between 4:41 and 4:53 giving free mammagrams, no underwires allowed, all participants receive a cup of water upon my completion.     Commentary by Salvador Gabor   I went to a few malls/shopping districts in the D.C. Area on Saturday. I went down to Georgetown, Pentagon City and Prince George's Mall. For all intents and purposes, these 3 shopping areas may attract the highest volume of shoppers in the D.C. Area. It's funny how during the rain, sleet, snow or sunshine we all go out and spend that money! Its not JUST a black thing either! EVERYONE was out. Suits, furniture, shoes......I mean whatever was being sold, people were buying it. I myself spent $100 in about 20 minutes. When I go shopping, I know what I want, get what I want and I get outta there!   But I began to think........all these stores, all these malls, all these things.......are at the palm of our hands, but what good are they? I saw a plasma TV for $19,500!!!!!!!! Believe me, this was the best TV I'd ever seen but $20 G's!!! I just wondered for a second, why are there no stock stores in the mall? Why are there no mutual funds stores in the mall? Why arent there any investment stores in the mall? I came up with an answer that I've known deep down for years but we all have to come to grips with........the things that are best for us will not be handed to us. They will not be clearly visible. The phrase "The Revolution will not be televised" became very clear to me in a mall on a saturday afternoon.  Going to the mall is cool. Having clothes and luxurious things are cool but that little $100 I spent could have gotten me some investments had I seen a Stocks & Bonds store in the mall before I got to the GAP. It's crazy where your money goes sometimes. I was in the barber shop and a guy said "It's getting to the point where when I walk out the house, Im GONNA spend $100". I was once told "If you break a $100 Bill, you might as well forget about that $100". The things we spend money on are just ridiculous. One minute the money is here and the next minute it is gone!   Let's talk about things not clearly being visible. Have you ever watched a commercial or had a friend in some system/pyramid, or got some pop up mail/spam about becoming an "overnight millionaire"? You ever wondered, "why does this person wanna show ME how to be a millionaire"? More than likely, its too good to be true. Honestly, you're not gonna find many people just out here willing to show you how to be financially free without a serious cost! Most people keep the good stuff to themselves. If your friend buys some new shoes that no one has ever seen before, he or she is NOT GONNA TELL YOU, so how does it look for a STRANGER to tell you how to be a MILLIONAIRE?!?!?! Go to a book store, the magazines about cars, women, music and fashion are in the front..........the investment books, books on health, spirituality, and better living are towards the back. Another example.......I know people who dont have jobs. Some of these people often ask me to "find them a job". And I look in the papers and other avenues that provide job searching but it comes down to one thing.......a closed mouth dont get fed. When you are hungry, you ask for food. You dont get someone else to ask for you. People like that dont last in this world. The same way you beg for change YOURSELF, you gotta look for a job YOURSELF. You dont ask another bum to collect change for you. The same way you sell drugs YOURSELF, you find a job YOURSELF. You dont stand outside with another guy and stand there while he sells your drugs. The same way you sit in the house all day and make an effort to do nothing, you gotta take that same effort and DO SOMETHING. Whatever you are doing wrong, you make an effort to do so. Take that energy and reverse it. But you gotta be able to think around just doing the obvious. Doing a job search JUST on the internet wont cut it baby! EVERYBODY goes on the net to job hunt, so you applying against thousands of people. You betta walk the streets, pick up a journal or local paper and go the alternate way!  The whole point of this matter is not to be drawn to the distractions. They are prevalent and at the palm of your hands. They are easily accessible and can easily keep you on the ground. Look beyond the obvious. No matter if its looking for a job, looking for a "come-up", or looking for a good way to spend $100. No one is gonna hand something to you and its not gonna fall in your lap.

      Sal's Corner "Africans"    First off, I am not a racist, prejudiced or any of those things. Im just the dude who tells it how YOU see it. But you either cant put it into words or you're scared to do so. But let me say that Africans are one of the funniest groups of people in the world. I love Africans. I love their style, flash and confidence. They are true black people. Not tainted with several races but true original blacks from Africa. I watch and observe them. Here are some of the things I have seen:   * Misconception: "Africans are smarter than everyone else". One word, Two syllables: HOGWASH! Let me tell you something. And this goes for any other foreign people who come to this land..........if you come across the world to be here, when you get here, you are not gonna be BS'n. All Africans arent smarter than us, they just left the dumb ones IN Africa. If I was African, and I had 2 sons, one was dumb and the other was smart, the SMART one could go to college in America but the dumb one would be at Timbuktu Community College! If you went to China, you wouldnt go over there to make $30,000/year. You can do that HERE!  * Attire: Africans are hit or miss people. Either they were NICE clothing. Such as Prada, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Ferragamo etc etc or they were Yellow Jeans and sandles. Aint too many "White-Tee" type people. If they are gonna get fly, THEY GET FLY, if not its "CROSS COLOURS" galore  * Hygiene: All Africans dont stink. NOPE, its just that the ones that do stink, they smell so bad that you think they all stink.   * Vehicle: Come on NOW! a 1986 560 SEL...........THATS ALL they are pushing. Yall know what im talking about...........do I gotta show yall!!!!     * Foul Language: Its is FUNNY to hear an African curse! Curse word of Choose: MUTHAF*&^%. They use that one very much so! Sometimes they say Nigga (Which is not a curse word) but its just funny when they say it. It comes out like (NEEGA!)  * UnderCover Africans: Yaaah yall thought I aint know. Some of yall are African and dont lead on to it. No accent or nothing. Name might even be regular. But when your parents come up to the school with that short sleeve party shirt, green slacks and them extra shiny gold watches we KNOW. Only Africans and Pimps on their days off dress like that.   * Jewelry. Look for the GOLD. Niggas wear platinum, Africans wear gold! Always remember that.  * Confidence: Africans display a serious amount of confidence. Go to the DMV. You and your buddy are scared you wont get your license renewed cause you might have tickets owed. But that fella over there in the Kente cloth, HE's determined to be in and out in 15 minutes. He dont even stand in LINE! "Who am I to stand in a line!"  * Names: Africans and their names can be wild. Sometimes the name denotes their African Heritage and sometimes it dont. You might run into a BABATUNDE MCGLOVER and be thrown off. Cause his parents coulda been high and off some black power tip and named him Babatunde OR he could be African and someway or another his family ended up as the McGlover's.  * Men: The thing that stands out the most about Africans is how they raise their young men. You dont see African women raising kids by themselves, you see that father in the family life. When you see an African family together, you can sense the strength of the father figure when they walk in the room. I've seen many documentaries about the rites of passage for several tribes and sects on the continent of Africa and their young men are prepared for life at an early age.    All in all, I love my African people. I love their attire, their music and how they may not know much English..........but if someone says "50 Cent" or "2PAC" THEY GO WILD! Next Week People......."Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"     Verbal Prohibitions by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  There are many words throughout the English language that have stronger meanigs to some people, and may frequent conversation more than others.  However some people should be prohibited from saying certain words.  Today I am looking at the Big folks.  Some people may say, hey big people catch a lot of flack, but there are certain things they should not say.  I myself try to stay away from awkward situations for myself and the other situatee.  Follow me, you shouldnt need your flashlight, but I will leave some bread crumbs.   Catapult:  Big people should never use this word.  Just say the nigga flew over the wall.  Aint nobody catapulting no 234 pound woman, not Robin Hood, not NASA, not King Kong.   Hammock:  Big people please no talk of buying hammocks, laying in hammocks, or even thinking about hammocks.  If you have been in a hammock keep it to yourself, there is no point in buying that much rope to take a nap outdoors.  If any of you plus-sizes people got a hammock, put a box-spring under him, because I know you laying low.   Snack: This is one of those words that sounds funny coming out a big girl's mouth. "think I'll have me a snack"  I think you better get some water, because you just had lunch Keeda.  Sat down and chill out, you still smell like them turkey wings from 20mins ago.   "No more...that's too much":  This is a phrase heard in places like Baskin Robbins, or your local carry-out.  More often than not, you aint hungry big folks, you just in there because of a hard burp.  You tasted that Manwich in the burp and now you think you hungry.  Just because they have sprinkles at Baskin Robbins doesnt mean you need them, probablly just came out of Giant with a bag of Milanos (Pepperidge Farms cookies) and gonna crush them on that big sundae.   "With his big self":  unless you follow this with "I know I am big but" please refrain from saying it.   "Think I'lll have..":  this is usually followed by something gargantaur, like a triple-cheese burger, or something fit for a grown man. Dont no man want a woman who eats as much as him (in one sitting)   "Uhm that looks good": I dont even want to get into this.  Needless to say it is said to often.  Keeda dont touch my food.   "...cakes":  Big people should not say cakes, treats or snacks   "Can I have a bite":  No not that walrus sized bite you bout to take.  dont do it, please dont do it, if I catch you I'm gonna tell it.   "Just a taste": Big people you aint tasting nothing, quit it.   Adjectives:  Big people keep those adjectives simple, when you start saying delectible and scrumptious, I have a problem with that.  You just greedy, it dont taste that good.   I wouldnt want you to think I am picking on the chunky  There is just no need to act a monkey  Over food, females just no need to act funky.  Remember that when at Golden Corral,  Or at Duff's before eating the whole cow.  Watch your carbs, and your fat intake,  Because nobody wants to be wedged on the train next to a human buttercake.

       "Go with your Gut" by Salvador Gabor    "Go with your Gut". It's often said but not understood. Going with the "GUT" feeling is considered the best resolution to a DEEP pondering of a question and/or choice. You go with your "GUT" when you really need a breakthrough. You go with your "GUT" when you really know that THIS MAYBE YOUR LAST SHOT. The "GUT" is all or nothing. No "GUTS" No Glory.  So why is the "GUT" so important. The "GUT" is that ugliness inside of you that says "Im gonna make, and I dont care HOW". People often ask "Do you have the GUTS to do it?" People say "Do you have the GUTS to make it?" So I ask you, do you have the GUTS? Maybe not??? Who knows. Only YOU know.  So what is a "GUT"? Literally a "GUT" is considered an imperfection of the physical body. You see "GUTS" everyday. "GUTS" are at the bar, "GUTS" are at the liquor store, "GUT" walked PASS the gym, "GUTS" are at the buffet on a WEEKDAY, "GUTS" are probably feeding themselves and/or eating while reading this. But truthfully its the people with "GUTS" that make it. The pretty people are full of fear. SCARY people. You dont rely on a pretty person in the time of need. It's either too gewey, too dirty, too heavy, too dusty or too dark, wet and slimy for a pretty person. Always go with your "GUT". If you dont have a "GUT", you dont make it. Pretty people are the figureheads, people with "GUTS" are the ones who lead this world. See pretty people find a way to "FIT" into the world. People with "GUTS" make space. Whether its letting out that thread space in the back of your slacks for more room, or finding the right girdle, the people with "GUTS" make it happen.  What to do when you dont have "GUTS"? Stick with that assigned nigga that has "GUTS". Keep a nasty, ugly down right piggly nigga wit GUTS. A group of pretty people cant make it with no "GUTS". Thats why when you go out, the sexy groups of women keep a lady with "GUTS". She aint afraid to tell a nigga off if he's outta line. She's not getting no play, so just cursing a man out is enough play for her with the opposite sex.  People with "GUTS" dont like to be seen on the scene. FOR WHAT???? People with "GUTS" are not for showing off. Their work does the talking. People with "GUTS" dont get the TV interviews, they just give a pretty nigga the script to answer all the questions. "Nigga I dont care what you say to the Camera, just give me the number to that place where you got that Fish Dinner". You probably never spoke to the nigga with "GUTS". Never even stopped to ask him of his name??? But you gonna call eeeemm. Yes you will.........  See........People with the "GUTS" stay in and work through lunch while you go out cause you wanna check out the honies. People with the "GUTS" stay at work late doing their job AND YOUR Job because you was rushing out on a Wednesday to go to a happy hour. People with the "GUTS" got up at 5:00 A.M. JUST to pray for you EVEN before you woke up at 11:30 for 11:00 Service. People with the "GUTS" fix your cars, mow your lawns, clean your clothes, make up your beds at the Days Inn, and work at Waffle Houses BY THEMSELVES on a late night shift. It aint easy or pretty having "GUTS" after all now is it?   BUT.....People with "GUTS" are sexy. When I grow up I wanna be that old man with the nylon sweatsuit and full of "GUTS". Im gonna make my "GUTS" work for me. Im gonna have nice clothes on and drive a shiny SUV. "Tony Soprano" is a man of true "GUTS". He makes having "GUTS" look good. "GUTS" make other people know when you say "Let's go out for dinner", they know you do some fine dining and you probably dont mine covering the bill. Know why........Cause you for the "GUTS" to cover the order.  Caution: Women, you dont really need "GUTS", thats why you marry guys like me. You go ahead and "FIT" into the world and let me make MY space. Oh yeah, I wanna extra pork chop on top of that fried rice if you would be so kind.........'Preciate YA!    Gang Activity by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   Turf wars often lead in the news.  Talk of rival gangs killing one another, and shooting innocent bystandards often clutters the airways, and locker-side conversations.  Whether it is the 1-5 Amigos or Dem Niggas down 1st, there is always gang-activity.   With any factions you often encounter the rivalry factor.  There are certain groups that just dont get along.  Things may cool off but they are bound to be at one another's throats.  Cowboys-Redskins, Red Sox-Yankees, Barry Farms-Sursum Cordas, the list goes on and on.  Even as people get older certain rivalries are inherited, you might not be apart of them from the start but if you are a bike messenger you will grow to dislike mailmen.   More hated than the Hatfields and the McCoys, the Messenger-Mailman rivalry began back in the 70's.  It all began at Humphrey's Messengery back in 1971.  The beef stemmed when long-time Messengerman Paul Lawrence Duvall left Humphreys for a job with the Post Office.  His buddy of more than 26 yrs, the late-great Messenger-Extraordinaire (the highest title of any non-Pony Express Messenger) Donald Lomax was furious with Duvall.  Lomax felt as though he was turning his back on the brotherhood.  Duvall was just trying to make a way for himself and his family.   Nonetheless, Lomax had a bone to pick with that nigga.  "Just gonna get uppity, and take a job with the 'birds', just because they letting niggas in" said Lomax in response to the Post Office hiring blacks in large numbers.  "Mr. Humphrey is 67yrs old and still delivers on the bike, but that aint good enuff for ya, niggas always wanna fly.  You fly right" Lomax said as Duvall drove down the street in his mail truck.  Duvall still a messengerman at heart, would not let his pride get the best of him, but there were just certain things a nigga couldnt say.  Challenging his loyalty was one of them.  Duvall parked that truck and walked over to Lomax and put his kickstand down, a tell-tell sign that somebody was bout to get dirty.   The two men stood toe to toe, towel to bandanam, right in front of Humphrey's, which was diagonally across from the MLK Post Office Pavilion.  A small crowd gathered and the two began to rumble.  Duvall pulled Lomax's bandana down over his eyes and started rabbit-punching him for all those snyde remarks.  Lomax suplexed (body-slammed for the wrestlingly challenged) Duvall and the 2 had at it for bout 15 minutes of good Dukes of Hazzard style fighting.  The two left scuffed and scarred and angry as two cats in a well.  The 2 never renewed their friendship after the scrum, nor did they renew their wrastling vows.  But it was understood, that Mailmen werent sellouts, and might be crazy 4sho.   So if you are ever downtown and a Bike Messenger and a Mailman cross paths, be sure to listen for profanity because there will be some.  The mailman may even invite the messenger aboard his truck, but know this, Mailmen and Messengers are like fire and ice, coke and slice, if you have one the other need not suffice, deliveries can be done by 3 or by 1, but no need in forcing gorilla tactics on a mail run.  Stand clear like a deer with headlights very near, for mailmen and messengers are like MC Ren with Dillingers aimed at lively-one.

       Interview with John "Cutter John" Sykes by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  (Assisted and Narrated by Salvador Gabor)    I gotta chance to sit down with a great yardsman in the D.C. Area. John "Cutter John" Sykes developed his grass cutting skills in the Northeast D.C. Area. A lifelong citizen of the Riggs Park area, "Cutter John" loves his "hood" and likes it to look nice and well kept. I gotta chance to sit outside and chat on the porch at "Cutter John"'s mother's house on Chillum Place in N.E.   SG: John How are you?  Cutter: aw man i'm real good business is bout to boom!  SG: I see your hands are a lil dirty already there Mr. Sykes!  Cutter: please dont call me Mr. Sykes, "Cutter-John" is what my clients call me....but yeah i was down in Ms. Lewis' flowerbed this morning. Look here take a bidness card, you can reach me at the number on the back, in the highlighter. Spelled my name wrong though, they got Stokes on there. My nephew made them......Boy only 3  SG: So how did you get into landscaping?  Cutter: oh man I got started long time ago.......I remember it like it was yesterday I got detention at Backus JHS over on South Dakota Ave. Got caught peeing on the radiator. So Mrs. Lewis, the principal, had me cut that big ole patch of grass next to Backus and all the grass across the street. Yep thats the same Mrs. Lewis whose flowerbed I work in now! I figure I wont charge since she helped me get started  SG: What is it about the landscaping industry that kept you in the game?  Cutter: aw man well you know in Riggs, there are alot of senior citizens, and they need their landscaped. So i scape it for them, for a small fee. Ya know, just enuff to keep me afloat. hmmmm I remember back in 85 LawnDoctor tried to drive me out......hey man hold still you got a "skito" on your lapel, lemme get this OFF I made....here it is (squirt) (squirt)  SG: Thanks Cutter. That almost got on my Gartelle Button-Up  Cutter: Ya notice that lemon-lime scent? That's my own trademark. Oh yeah and the name's CutterJohn to you.  SG: Alot of the younger guys embrace you around the Riggs Park neighborhood, how do you respond?  Cutter: (pulling out shower cap) man you got to love that which loves you. If you dont, you have love lost. That is why I take such pride in scaping.  Whether it is Mrs. Lewis' yard (putting on shower cap, and tightening laces on Asics) or the Widow Watkins-Dean.  I just gotta sculp the lawn, hone my skill, perfect it, because it symbolizes the Riggs section........(waives to neighbor) Hey there Mr. Randolph, be there by 4:50!!!!.......Dont worry i'll fill that birdbath too. Mmmmhhmm. I like to put a lil cinammon in Mr. Randolphs birdbath, keeps the robins nice and red  SG: How do you gain clientele?  Cutter: Well..... you know everybody around here pretty much knows me you know i grew up around here, right back there on Chillum they see me all the time, I like to take walks down to Jaybird's all the way down the other end of Lasalle Elementary. Kinda hard to miss me in my attire i like to match my head gear with my tennie's. Gotta stay professional  SG: What other interests do you have?

Gotta go, he gets that back yard for free if I am five minutes late!!!!!   If you want to call on Cutter John for a landscaping job, he's always out and about in the Riggs Neighborhood in Northeast D.C.. Just look for the middle-aged man wit the shopping cart full of grass-cutting materials, a khaki suits and some old Asics that his incarcerated nephew used to wear.      Indestructible Niggas by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   There are some niggas you just cant kill.  Today we focus on one, a buddy of mines, named Procrastination.  I call him "Cras" for short.  He is the type of nigga that has been with you for years and years, just hanging around.  Don't get me wrong he aint all bad, he aint just on the corner, the dude has a degree.   Nobody knows for sure when the nigga was born, probablly the reason this holiday is celebrated on the 10th and not the 9th.  Just wanted to wait in the womb, because that anesthesia had a lil nigga woosy.  He is often seen pulling all-nighters to finish papers, and meets you at the let-out instead of going to the party.   Cras lives by intricate financial policies, he would rather wait and see if something goes on sale, than buy it prematurely.  A very laid back individual to say the least, nothing really gets to Cras,  doesnt start worrying til the 25th hour, but then again, he aint never late, just close enuff to make you wonder with wet armpits.   Cras is the type of guy that will even save your life, he aint in no hurry so while the hotheads are pressed to get fly for some honies, ole Cras is just laying in wait, more than likely let-out bound.  Just in time to miss the fights, shootings, but early enuff to find a tender or three.  "Dont mind me, I'm Cras, not Rude his car is burgundy".   Cras is known to hang with the big-wigs.  All up in Congress fooling with the Senate, why you think it takes so long to pass good laws.  Ted Kennedy invited Cras over for dranks.  Cras is the reason we get gift-cards, malls get way too crowded and everything is gone by the time Cras picks you up to go shopping.  He often keeps many brothas sober, Cras aint ready to drink unless it is past 9pm, but then again, you know the nigga dont live to far from Bass Liquors.   Cras is the type of nigga you might not see for a while,  rumors circulate, about no more Procrastination.  I dont fool with the guy anymore, sure you dont, that nigga comes over late at night have you girls trying to pay that light bill online, because he kept you in all night and the next day and you couldnt get any stamps.  Dont trip Cras is still alive, seen him go 2-3 months without a peep, but always shows up if not on the first but definitely by the 15th.   Procrastination is a well-known figure in the Black Community.  When he is at the clubs and cookouts, niggas from miles around are heard calling him by his nickname "Hey, get it Later"

       "Negresscent Holiday" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr .  Many times people get caught up in these heritage-based holidays, and dont care to share the meaning or the enjoyment of the day with anyone else.  Well today I'm gonna let you know about St. Pernell's Day, the Friday after St. Patrick's Day.   St. Pernell's Day was started by in 1974, somewhere in Inglewood.  You see Pernell ran a "speak-easy" out of his basement.  Pernell Pike, or "PP" as he was known to his good buddies, had been a nigga in the neighborhood for years, selling anything he could get his mits on.  From bootleg wine to gold fronts, to cable-ready tv's.  Pernell was a nigga on the under for sure.   The day after St. Patrick's Day in '74, Pernell and his drankin potnas, were a lil rippled from watching the SWAC tournament via satelite.  Just then Big Earl said something about a St. Patricks Day party.  Pernell muttered "Patrick who, that nigga owes me 43 dollars for those cartons of squares, he aint no saint"  mind you they had been drinking since 11:30 in the morning.  "I'm a saint, man I let the nigga have 'em and that was last Thursday, you know I'm funny about my moneys.  Man it's St. Pernell's Day, drinks on the house, since I'm being so nice, he Tilda make me a fish sammich, use that croaker"   From then on St. Pernell would always get real drunk around the SWAC tourney and do something nice, a true neighborhood saint.  St. Pernell Pike.   I also have Mammagrams 1 for 2, and 2 for 5 down behind the Footlocker at Iverson Mall, part of the St. Pernells Day sale.

       Sal's Corner "Pretty Girls "  Disclaimer: The phrase "Pretty Girls" maybe replaced with the phrase "Bad Joants" throughout this article. Some guys call females different things, I call em "joants" from time to time. Might refer to a female as "slim", dont get offended please its all in humor.  "Bad Joants".......Every dude wants "Bad Joants" and Every dude claims he GOT "Bad Joants". So I asked myself.....what is a "Bad Joant"? Let's talk about "Bad Joants". Who they are, how you can spot them and their tendencies. Now some of yall women are reading this article like "Im glad he finally talked about me!". Girl you know you aint cute!!! Sike naw moving along........  * You know she is a "Bad Joant" when you walk in a room with her and the females stop and look. Females are hard judges. They tryna find the slightest thing to down the next "joant". If one ankle is bigger than the other, they knocking her down a notch. So when a female just STOPS and is speechless at another "Joant", that "joant" is tough!  * Fellas you gotta "bad joant" when your mans and em tell another dude that you gotta "bad joant" and you bump into THAT dude in the street and he is like "Yeah I heard you got it poppin wit a winner!!!"  * She's a "bad joant" when you walk into a restaurant with her and alias dudes just start knodding their heads at you outta respect. In their minds its ONLY 3 things they can say.....1) How  did HE get HER? 2) How can I get HER? and/or 3) I RESPECT what he's doing up in here!  * "Bad Joants" drink alot of bottled water. Sit back and watch fellas, MOST "bad joants" drink bottled water throughout the day. Now see....I shouldnt have told the ladies this, cause some of yall ugly ones gonna be rushing home to pour some tap water into that Jelly Jar so you can be walking around the office like somebody think you cute.   * Just cause you get big "play" at work dont mean you are a "bad joant". If we see you enough, you may begin to look better and better.  * "Pretty Girls" keep it laid back. If it's a man that she likes, if he doesnt pursue, she is gonna chill. She KNOWS its another guy bound to come along and muster up the courage.  * Females, Im a tell yall another male secret. if you TRULY are a "bad joant" let me tell you......We be knowing yall names and whole info WAY before we are officially introduced to yall. We meet yall officially for the first time and have the nerve to be like "Oh ok so your name is Keisha? Nice to meet you Keisha. Where do you work?"  The whole time you KNEW ALREADY that she is a data entry clerk down at the Department of Commerce, she make $15.75/hr, she drives a Maxima and her boyfriend is locked up on a Weapons Charge.    That's all my time for now. Im pretty sure there is gonna be a "Pretty Girls" pt. 2. Its almost certain! But for now... "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin". Before I forget please go and check out "Sweet Erin's Pepper Grill" in Ft. Washington, MD. The best selection of Cakes, Pies and Chocolates in the D.C. Area. We will have a full page ad for his store later in the week.        “Ahhh, it’s spring again, everybody knows it’s spring again”-Biz Markie  -By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.    The Distinguished Gartelle W. Sexton, Esq. is back just in time.  Yes folks, it’s that time of year again. Time to put away the sweaters and boots and break out the windbreakers. No more groups of women downtown standing in a circle trying to keep warm on a cigarette break.  The smell of April showers, flowers, and bar-b-q ribs will soon fill the air.   Cookouts and sundresses, pool parties and booty shorts.  But remember to DUCK!  The youngsters will be out again and you know how they been trying to kill each other all winter.   So ladies her are a few things to remember for changing of the seasons:   Go get a pedicure. Not now, but right now. Don’t wait until the last minute to get your feet did.  Some of y’all have been letting your toes hibernate all winter. You gots to keep your foot game on point year round. Y’all gonna wanna wear the open toes and strappy sandals as soon as possible, so you gotta rehab your feet first. Nobody wants to see your feet if they look like you been digging oil pipeline tunnels with your feet over in Iraq.   If you still wear Reebok Princesses (or 5411’s depending on where you're from) that’s cool, but if they ain’t fresh, get ‘em outta here. Donate them things to the homeless.  It’s bad enough you haven’t outgrown them, but if you gonna wear them, they can’t look like soggy bread.   Your nails. Now ladies, sometimes I like when it y’all wear them natural. No polish or nothing, as long as they are neat and clean. But if you are gonna get your nails done, keep it simple. French tips or a BASIC color.  Period. There are no exceptions.  No green or neon orange nails, no wild designs.  No man wants a woman who looks like she had her fingers tye-dyed at summer camp.   Ladies, get rid of all animal print dresses. I know a lot of animals died at the Zoo this winter but all I can think of is Cheetos! when I see you.   If your shins look like people been putting out their cigarettes on them, wear pants.   Sheer anything is not acceptable in the workplace.   Those colorful Louis Vitton purses. Get rid of them.  I hated them last summer and I will hate them again. Y'all spent $500 on an ugly purse that doesn't match anything except a box of Crayolas and you women are so fickle that they won't even be "in style" this spring/summer.  They look like they were inspired by a fourth grade Lite Brite art project.   So ladies follow these rules and your spring and summer will get off to a great start.  Now to each his own and most importantly you should always do you.  You know that us brothers will be on our lunchbreak enjoying the view that is you, so when in doubt about your attire, remember, wearing something tight is always a good option, unless you have more girth than it's worth.    Fellas, don't think I forgot about you.   To all you brothers that wore Durango boots to work during the winter. Cease and desist. Put them John Wayne boots away, forever.   You have never been to China and you barely even go to Chinatown, so no more Chinese collared shirts in the '04. If Yao Ming doesn't wear them, why should you?   Sandals. This is a sensitve subject.  Now personally, I don't do sandals. My feets gotta be fully surrounded at all times. I came up in the hood, and I did some running from the police in my day. Can't run from the bodines and lose a sandal. Go to jail wearing some sandals, it's gonna be a long night in 6D.  Now a lotta brothers in the older generation prefer sandals when the weather gets warm.  I can respect that. Just not my thing. But just like I told the ladies, get a pedicure. Yeah I said it fellas, if you gonna wear sandals get your feet taken care of.   If you insist on showcasing your ugly feet, go with your lady to Lee's Nails and let Hyun Kim hook you up for $14.95.  At minimum get put some cocoa butter or vaseline on you feet.   Short sleeved dress shirt and a tie, aka "The Medgar Evers" or "MP:The Counselor" look:  This should not occur. You are not a Southern Baptist Minister in the Civil Rights Movement, this is not a good look for you, or anyone else for that matter.  I understand its hot outside and you want to let your forearms breathe, but to say it point blank, this just ain't cool.  Short sleeved dress shirts shouldn't even exist, much less be worn by a Black man.  The only place you can even find a short sleeved dress shirt is at Zayres. Now when is the last time you seen a Zayres?   Linen. Now this a tricky one. I like linen. But your linen 'fits must MATCH. And brothers, unless you are in Trindad for Sinbad's Soul Festival, peach, yellow, and orange colored slack are unacceptable.  Colorful linen belongs on your dining room table.   Now I'm all about supporting Black business. Shooters, Hobo, We R One, etc. is all good with me.  I wear some of their stuff. But if you gonna wear the urban gear, NO MORE GLITTER shirts or headbands. Fellas, glitter is for pre-school arts and crafts, and that truck nosed stripper at the Skylark.   Let's take it down a notch on the throwbacks this summer. I know this won't happen cuz some of y'all couldn't afford an official throwback last summer and been saving up all winter for that 4XL Walt Frazier Kindergarten team throwback jersey.  Throwbacks are so 106 & Park now. Kneegrows sure know how to take a fashion trend and over do it.   Wife beaters. Unless you at the pool or y'all opened the fire hyrant around the way, put a tee on over top your wife beater. I hate seeing kneegrows on the Metro with only a wife beater on, all sweaty and stankin.  I never know if he just finished fighting or if he didn't finished getting dressed.   White tees are a staple for a hot spring/summer day. Invest. Holla @ Sallimo, he'll hook you up with some fresh white tees. One for $8, three for $24.   Fellas, step ya game up this spring.  Comfort and class are the key words this year. They will take you very far and the ladies will treat you like a star. You'll get some comfort and some ___ if you get my meaning gentlemen.

      "Commercial" by Salvador Gabor   *** Here at the Salvador Gabor Project, we do alot of what we call "Word Play". We love to play on words. We do this because many times, the masses use words out of context and inappropriately. So if you notice a pattern on this site with the way we "play" with words, nevermind us, just listen. Notice the word "listen" and not the word "look". We want you to HEAR this site and not just see it. Open ya ears, let this Q-tip do its job.  "Commercial". What is "commercial". I've learned that a "commercial" is an ad that promotes a product. This "commercial" is usually about 15 to 20 seconds long. "Commercials" do alot for the selling of a product. Super Bowl Sunday is the BIGGEST day for "commercials". Companies pay between $1-3 Million for a spot during that 4-hour period. I would assume that "commercials" must be THAT important.  Then I look at society. Society says if you follow the crowd and do what others do for the sake of doing what others do, you are deemed as being "commercial". If everyone listens to a certain musical artist and you jump on the wagon, you are "commercial". If everyone is wearing a certain type of clothing and you go out and get it, you are "commercial". We can go on and on. But regardless, NO ONE wants to be "commercial", now do we?  Many of us are caught in the crossfire as innocent bystanders (so to speak) when it comes to being "commercial". I myself, I am a "white-tee" kinda guy. Now that the white-tee is considered to be "commercial", I get persecuted for my apparel. Im here to say that I've been doing that style for years. I was around when it was cool to wear a white-tee out in public. Then I was still "white-tee'n it" when the jersey's came. Now that the "Button-Ups" are here, im still in my white-tee. Thats just me and MY example. Many of us may have more to share. But I got caught in innocent cross-fire.  Due to the word "commercial" being used to describe "jock-riders" and "followers", many people overuse it and take it too seriously. Many of us go out of our way NOT to be "commercial". Hence the new wave of young men and women wearing "WILD" clothing. Females with these self-made skirts and new natural hair growth. Males with these leather blazers and tight tee-shirts with "Black Power" messages on it. Back in like 1998, this was cool. The first wave of people doing it seemed ok. I wasnt into it at all, but I respected their move. As we move into 2004, NOT being "commercial" has become SO "commercial".   As we grow older, people go through several phases. We go through the "Im tryna be in the crowd" phase. Then the "Im doing me, so thats my excuse for not combing my hair" phase. Then the "Im just gonna go to work and whatever happens, happens" phase. Regardless of where you are in these phases, or even if these phases dont define where you are, remember, being "commercial" is not what everyone is doing. It's being an ad for someone else or for a style. Wearing a coofi doesnt make me conscience. Wearing a white-tee doesnt make me a thug. Wearing a suit doesnt make me corporate. When you focus on attire to make your statement of "who you are", you are "commercial". Whether you represent a few or the masses, if your mindset is programmed to believe the clothes make you, then all you are is AN AD THAT PROMOTES A PRODUCT. Now go grab another Qtip so I can clear that left ear.     "The Outside Voice" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Many people often tell us a people dont loud talk, use your inside voice.  This is a good tool to use, especially if you dont want people in your business.  But sometimes that Outside Voice, that hear me, that beer-plated echo in the public bathroom, yeah that is what you need.   Sometimes you need to let the Outside Voice come from within.  Everyone has an inner-nigga, and he should be, he must be heard.  Sometimes he needs to be the main attraction not just the side-bet at the dice game.  If you at the job and somebody is giving you guff, you might need to tell them "Look here, you better do it, cause James Folkes aint nobodys ho".   Oh the Outside Voice comes with many smells, tastes and feelings.  The barbershop, the place where you get your fried fish, church, the street, the liquor store.  Many times we as black folk try to be conservative and neglect our Outside Voice, thus keeping him inside.  You cannot keep an Outside creature inside, it will mess up your house, or outgrow your house.  You can keep buying new houses, or just set the lion out back to roam, and be at peace outside.   Sometimes the outside voice comes from outside.  It might be the nigga who pumps your gas giving you 3minutes of wisdom on how your neighborhood is more than it seems.  It might be that old lady in church telling you about these young girls, and how they dont wash their hands.  The Outside Voice should never be kept in the zoo, you just cant cage heeem up, but sometimes he needs a leash.   There are many animals in this so-called civilization that run free, racism, greed, and funk.  You need to let that Outside Voice outside before he eats all your ribs.     For years we as niggas have been instructed to be seen and not heard  to understand but never say a mumbling word.  speak soft and kep our eyes to the curb.  Use your inside voice, that was cracker barrell volume of choice  In this day it is sometimes the outside voice that needs to be heard  The voice of the black masses, the black people's word.  Many people often wonder what guides them  Could it be the voices in their head that leads them  to be mislead or is it the common man under the streetlights so dim.  picking his teeth and counting his bread.  An outside voice might come from many sources,  a wino, the barber, and loud women big as horses,  no need to speak quiet with these powerful outside forces.  Street people talking loud but crackheads dont get divorces,  just smoke real good with no chance of remorses.  Some people say the word on the street aint right,  but if you on Kenilworth go thru stop on red but never for the blue light.    I'm just a nigga in the seatbelt.    Every now and then we might have a special guest on to write. Today is one of those days. Our guest today is gonna give it you from a female's perspective............  "Dream on" by KM  In my lifetime, I’ve made choices. Some good , some bad, but no regrets. Right now I reflect on my short lived years and I am amazed at how many of those choices were influenced by my family’s expectations of me, other people’s opinions of me or my obligation to do just what is right. Getting a good job? Did I really want to work right out of school? Maybe I really just wanted to sit home watching Judge Judy and Oprah for a couple of months, traveling and kicking it with my friends.   For example college. Did I really want to go to college? Was this something I had waited for all my life? Or, was this a choice made for me by my parents years ago? Funny, I never contemplated not going. Still, I did not know what I wanted to study or learn when I got there. Good grades? Did I really care about getting A’s? Or was knowing the consequences behind disappointing the people around me the driving factor in obtaining good grades. I realize that in college I learned, masterfully , how to get by. The information I sometimes read, the papers I wrote, the presentations and other requirements I fulfilled to get the grade. Not to be enlightened. As I think of my motivation now, I am relieved to know that I am finally doing things primarily for the expectations I have set out for myself. Remember back to college, there were so many things we wanted to do. Sports Agent, Media Broadcaster, Advertising Exec…. Travel…. And then… You enter the job market running. We get caught up in the job and our new lifestyles. Let us not forget our dreams, whatever they may be. This time before your next Birthday, reflect on those things, you really want to do or be in life. Start saving NOW, planning NOW and executing NOW to get there. For real, time is flying and there are probably some things you expected to have done by now and where are you in that process? Everyday ask yourself where Do I want to be? Everyday evaluate if what you are doing today is going to help you get there. Because, ultimately where we end up is up to us. Whether we end up locking ourselves into the same everyday job, or go out there and pursue our dreams, time is moving fast. As much as I would like to blame my failures on someone else, I gotta do things for me. Smell me?

      "A Fresh Black Mind" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  On today's spotlight of negressence we would like to take a look a fresh black mind.  The year 1986, James Garfield was a normal 4th grade student at Bruce Monroe Elementary School.  He carried a bookbag, was learning a little Spanish, and played a mean game of kickball.   However James was more advanced than most students.  He picked up on things faster than most kids his age.  He had given up Transformers at an early age, and took a keen liking to all things nigga-based.  He kicked the ball harder than any 4th grader that dawned Ms. Petry's class or any at Bruce Monroe.  He was significantly stronger than most 4th graders, and only went-to-the-body with 6th grade heavyweights.  Garfield didnt let his physical dominance control his youth, but used his mind as well.   Oh but James Garfield was more than a strong and smart 4th grader.  Garfield also liked females faster than most kids his age.  He was kissing on the swings quite early.  One late May afternoon, Garfield was eyeing Precious McNeil, a 6th grader who had "physically proceeded" her own 6th grade expectations.  Garfield catches Precious in Ms. Petry's cloakroom, and inspects her new-found "groceries".  He was definitely a fresh mind, and it was here that the future leading Black Mammagrapher acquired his skill.   Garfield's cloakroom examinations, helped him set his sights on med school.  He was the youngest graduate of the UDC Medical School, which is actually taught by janitors from Catholic and American Medical Schools.  He graduated UDC's Medical Program with a doctorate in NipTechnology, and is the leading correspondent in black mammagrammography.  He is a consultant with DC General and Providence Hospitals, as well as CNO of the Penthouse.  He accomplished all of this before the age of 30.  He is often reffered to as Booby Houser, because of his age, and feel for medicine.  Today we would like to congratulate James "Booby Houser" Garfield on the "Touch and Go" methods of Black Medicine.    "Nike Caters to Urban Needs" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.     The newest creation from Nike is the Nike Curb Max. This new street shoe is perfect for angling your feet on the curb, for the best possible approach for getting your rocks off.  The Curb Max also provides proper ankle and arch support for the long hours that streetlife requires.  It has great traction for "hand2hands", and cushioning for breakaway speed in the occurrence of BOdines.

      "What is Love?" by Salvador Gabor   This may be one of the most asked question besides, "whats the meaning of life?". What IS love? Many times, we get caught up in what television, peers and trends tell us about love. Television changes, your peer groups change and the trends of this world most definitely change. But love doesnt. Love is a gift given and not received. When you truly love you dont see the reward or the return on your investment. OTHER people see the return on the investment of love you have sewn.  Often times, people feel that they are hurt by love. I wouldn't say love hurt you. I would say that your expectations hurt you. I would say that a person hurt you. But I would never say love did it. See, love isnt hard. For guys, love should be like a behind the back pass. For gals, love should be like cornrowing someone's head while not even paying attention. That may sound corny but in so many words...........love is second nature. It comes easier than we make it to be.  See, the best example of love is with a child. If you and your mate are expecting a child, you KNOW things wont always be great. That child isnt born yet, but you know once and while that baby will be sick. Once in a while, that child will be in trouble. Once in a while and more times that not, that child wont appreciate ANYTHING you are doing on their behalf for years to come. YET, with all that being said, you still plan for 9 months to bring this child into the world. You dont hold a grudge when your 18-year old son doesnt call you from his dorm 10 hours away. You're at home wondering where he is and he's having a good time. He doesnt call because he's having the time of his life. You send money, he spends money. You send food, he eats food. You pay for the light bill, he cuts lights on. When its all said and done he doesnt know the emptiness that you have without him. But YET, you still love.  So many people are hurting because they didnt get out of a relationship what they wanted. There's your problem. You dont go into it looking to get something out of it. The last thing I want to say is that I picked my wife because "she does for me". You love because YOU feel a need to share with someone the overflow of love you have within. If no love is within and you're looking for it in someone else, you wont get it. No matter if you are getting back what you feel is deserved, you keep loving. If you feel a need to pull back, then do so. Dont be a fool. Just dont take it to heart. Humans do humanily things in human situations. Love yourself. Treat yourself like a King/Queen. Never be hurt because some person doesn't feel a certain way about you. If you truly love yourself, you will see that YOU are the person that matters. If you are looking for love, look within.   "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"   And now since we are all looking for love.............   "Personals" by Salvador Gabor  I know that many of us wonder where to look for love. Is it at church? Is it at the club? Is it at the grocery store? No need to look any further. We here at the Salvador Gabor Project are dedicated to finding you love. Ladies, sit back and relax as we present to you today's top bachelor.............     Jeremy Turnell Riggins  Jeremy is a 21 year old Scorpio from Cleveland, Ohio.

      "1 Year Anniversary" By Salvador Gabor  Today is  urlLink Jerome's   One-year anniversary on his site. I want to extend my most sincere thanks to him for letting me write over there during the end of 2003. Rome and I have talked several times about the future and we both have ideas about making our dreams a reality. We play alot on this site but this is something that we enjoy doing. So Rome......congrats.      Now back to our regularly scheduled ignorance..............   "A Nigga for All-Time" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.  Today we morn the passing of a phenomenal man, an institution on the DC Dodgeball Scene.

He was a coach to over 200, and a mentor to many. His innovative ways of coaching football and basketball forced him into Dodgeball as a youth.  His barber Leslie "Curley" Bowers, remembers Duke's last game "ole Duke is cussing the referee something terrible, I mean he is letting him have it, and the ref knocks Duke's hat off, boy they got to fighting, and he hit the ref and made him Dook on heeemself, spilled my cream soda right there"  Duke was a tenacious competor and coached with an iron-fist.  He had a soft spot for one pudgy fellow, who could move like water on a whale.  Jimmithy Lancaster remembers Duke's famous iced tea, "man it was like Project Potion, helped me play some of best games, man I'm gonna miss my man, miss you old dude"  Duke an avid musician during his dodgeballic hours.

       Sal's Corner "Names Vol. 3"    As some of our longtime readers know, I wrote 2 articles on Rome's site about Names. One being for male names and the other for female names. Now I am taking it deeper. Let's talk about Last Names! Not just any last names but last names that can be used to call someone. Last names that make you call that person by there last name.  * Fletcher- Oh yes, Fletcher's NO MATTER WHAT CITY, live in the hood. They could very well be well off financially but aint nothing like being hood rich in the inner city of Detroit! Ole Fletcher has a regular job. He probably shakes off his co-workers and makes them mad cause he does his work on HIS time and pace  * Robinson- Robinson stands out at his job. He either does a great job or a very BAD job. People only call him at loud tones. You always use your "Outside Voice" when dealing with Robinson (Check for Reggie real soon with an article on the "Outside Voice")  * Briscoe - I know or know of about 3 or 4 Briscoe's. Most Briscoe's are called by FIRST AND LAST NAME. You have to. It just sounds good.  * Cunningham- This may be one of the strongest last names to have. Especially as a black person. Even a lady will be called by her last name if it is Cunningham. Thats why you cant have too many Cunningham's in one setting. It leads to alot of confusion.  * Porter - Porter does work for you. Whether it is mechanical, plumbing or some sort of handy work. Most men who work in uniforms dont ever have the correct name on their badge. Porters ALWAYS do.   * Patterson - Patterson might be a deacon at your church. If it's a woman, she probably is a nice looking older woman. The Patterson's only drive Cadillacs  * Wiggins - Wiggins may be a "Coon". Wiggins sometimes is the kinda guy that kisses up to any and everybody. Women who are born in the Wiggins' family hope to marry as soon as possible.   * Taylor - Taylor works in a uniform type of job like "Porter" but he keeps himself clean. Taylor is that busdriver or police officer that does no work. He might just rap to the ladies all day.  * McDaniel - Most people call this person "McDaniels". I still havent figured out why the "S" is added on??????  * Carter- Carter is full of it. Most people see Carter coming and say "That OLE Carter". Carter makes you mad! He really does. He always uses up ALL his leave on the job or takes the longest time to get back to the house wit your McDonalds. He the type that will go to McDonalds, get your food, then go to the carryout but aint ordered his food yet.    "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin".     "Action Words vs. Adventure Words" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   Action Words and Adventure Words, well it's kind of like when you learned verbs for the first time, but way worse.  Running, writing, riding, and words like that take on a whole nother meaning.  Put your pens down, this is an open-mind exercise.    Action Words :  Action Words require a certain action, either self-induced or one imposed upon another.   Cuss:  "Dont you cuss me"  oh yes this means somebody has told off an older person.  This is usually used in front of company.  It has no gender.  In it's female form, the woman usually proceeds to tell the man off, in front of her and/or his friends.  In the male form, the man might go take a walk, and come back and give ole Eleanor a good-shake.   Hyche: pronounced "hush", "Hyche your mouth".  Another word with age, used to cease noise immegiately.   Run:  "Run me my numbers"  This form of the word run requires that you get down to the liquor store and play them numbers before 12, nobody wants to miss the daily Pick 3.     Adventure Words : Now Adventure Words dont necessarily have to be verbs, they are just words that take you somewhere else, on an adventure.   Heeem: pronounced him, "Can I tell heem, You better tell heeem" That heeem takes you a variety of places, maybe to Carolina or Georgia, it might just put you on your back porch, and Ms. Rawlins grandboy Tim aint in the house.  "Tim aint here, can I tell heeeem, you lookin for heeem"   Tisn't:  most serious form of "isn't, is not":  A serious word to say the least, and is always said slowly, in order to specifically understand that Gary aint there, and he might not be there, when he gets there, and if he comes in there his aunt is gonna let heeeem know something.  "Gary tisn't in".  When a statement like that is made, you won't be leaving a message, so don't try because Aunt Doris will be hanging up on you in mid-sentence.   Tousch him:  pronounced touch heeem:  This one might take you to church.  Sitting with the Young Adult Choir, or the Jr. Usher Board, and Marcus done fell asleep next to you.  "Tousch him, wake that boy up".  You could also wind up on the bus, "...is this your piece of paper".   Tonic:  A wild word to say the least.  This might have you down the country in your Aunt's bedroom.. "Don't knock that epsom-tonic over, matter of fact hand it to me"  It might have you outside walking past the porch where the old men hang out.."That boy had the tonic, yes he did".  Last but not least tonic might have you in a basement with your father, playing cards, Tonic goes unsaid, but you see it several times poured into that drankin glass, you know that plastic bottle with the yellow label.   Oh it aint over, just didn't want to overwhelm you.  You cant learn your timestables in a day, so let it digest.  This stove is always hot.  I'm just a nigga in a seatbelt.

       "Employee of Note" by Salvador Gabor    Alot of people think that we just pick and clown on people. NO I beg to differ. We here at the Salvador Gabor Project feel the need to recognize those individuals who are hard at work and making a difference in society. Most of us spend time doing nothing. Surfing the net, taking 2-hour lunch breaks and not to mention coming in late and leaving early. But we are here to salute REAL workers     Dr. Cleveland Ginyard, chef expertise  Mr. Ginyard has served in the Morgan State University Cafeteria for 27 years. Since 1977, he has been responsible for all of the tasty, delictable treats the Bears' students have eaten on campus for 4 decades now. Mr. Ginyard specializes in his favorite breakfast meal "The Breakfast Bear". This is a hearty meal for the students who need energy for their upcoming day. The meal includes Scrapple, Eggs over easy and Buttermilk Toast along with 2 Sausage Links (with or without slits in the middle) and a waffle.  Mr. Ginyard isnt the most talkative fella. Yet, he has developed a strong relationship with some of the students. "Yeah I talks to eeem. But dont think Ole Ginyard is gonna give you a free meal or an extra biscuit wit dem Panny Cakes." says Mr. Ginyard. Tasha McAllister a Jr. Marketing Major at Morgan State says "the only words i've ever heard him say was 'With or WITHOUT Slits?'"  Now dont think that Mr. Ginyard is a slacker on the dinner side. His Baked Chicken and Seafood Salad combo is a force to be reckoned with. He also used to serve "Hogmaws and Fat Back Meat" until Maryland State Laws restricted the amounts of pork being used in State and Public Schools back in 1986.   As for life outside of the kitchen for Mr. Ginyard........well there isnt too much to life besides cracking eggs and the sound of bacon being fried to a fricasee on a stovetop. Here's to Mr. Ginyard, a master chef amongst cooks.      The following is a "test run" for the winner of out writing contest.     Salvador Gabor Writing Contest Entry#221 By Blake C. Winters   Primping Pimpin Paul of the 15th & L chapter was being harassed by Metropolitan Police at about 1:30am Tuesday morning. The police had his burgundy Caddy with gold trim blocked in on the corner of 16th & L. It was in front of the Green Pub where he publicly pleads his case to the authorities. Getting out of his car in his burgundy and gold party shirt and top hat was enough to convince officer Daniels to make an arrest. Over and over again Officer Daniels attempted to implicate Pimpin Paul in the local prostitution ring. After every inquiry Pimpin Paul simply replies     Paul: “no I am not involved! And I don’t know no pimps or no hoes ”.   Officer Daniels: “ Then why did that lady in the white fur jacket and panty-set get out of that man’s car and give you money?”   Paul: “Yeah well she owed me money”  Officer Daniels: “At one in the morning on a Tuesday?”   Paul: “Just because the lady gave me money at one in the morning doesn’t make me a pimp! Just because I have a car like this, gold teeth, and matching outfit doesn’t mean I’m a pimp!”  Officer Daniels: “Then explain that perm”?    After the officer questioned Paul’s hairstyle Paul got defensive and quickly became uncooperative with Officer Daniels. Officer Daniels by procedure had to call for back-up. Moments later another officer pulls up gets out of his cruiser and walks over to the scene.   Officer Lathan: What seems to be the problem here?  (Before Officer Daniels could explain the situation Paul yells out)    Paul: "Hey man! Do I look like a pimp to you?"  Officer Lathan: "Book ‘em!"  (Once the police took Paul down to the station he was forced to make an official statement.)  Primpin Pimpin Paul’s Official Statement: "Asking a pro-ho to stop hooking is like asking a pro-athlete to stop playing the game. Both make their living sacrificing their flesh for other’s enjoyment, both are paid more than their service is worth, and both have learned to take hard hits. They know no other way to live."   Disclaimer: Events described are almost true. Names and street corners have been changed to ensure privacy.   Comments from the editor: Now if you’re going to be involved in illegal activities why wear the uniform? I totally understand and encourage the need for the hooker to wear the uniform, its free advertising. But the Pimp, I just don’t understand. Drug pushers would be better off wearing T-shirts with big letters say I SELL DRUGS! ARREST ME! At least they could claim to the judge he was joking at the time. But that perm and that party shirt, there’s nothing funny about that!

       "Niggas Write to 'get right' " by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   Many people often worry about things they have no control over, from other peoples reactions and mindsets, and whether or not to take a match in the bathroom.  "You can please some people sometime, but you cant please all the people all the time" --Bob Marley--.  This being said do what you do, just get right in.  Oh and if you eat them spicy buffalo wings, the match wont ease the wallpaper sting.  Follow me if you will, I dont eat trail mix, but I will mix the trail.  If you see footnotes, pick yourself up off the ground, I didnt mean to kick you that hard.   People always seek attention, recognition, and emotional perscription from others.  Sometimes people do this in expectation that someone will change or award you "Best Nigga of the Week" for being so kind, smart, and such a good communicator.  Nigga please, do things selflessly.  If you waiting for a nigga to recognize all the things you want recognized, you better get some silicone post-its.  If you understand people, then sometimes you need to know that that man understands you, and understands that you need too many pat-on-the-backs, and his depriving you of these pat-on-the-backs is a lesson learned.  Starvation can be the meal love found, not the meal love fed.   There are a couple of ignorant people who hang together that really bother people.  We all know them, they go by the names, "Disprespect", "Betray", and "Belittle".  They love to hang out, and talk about anything, and mess with with anyone who will listen.  "Disrespect", often jealous of his brother "Respect" feels the need to get "Belittle" and the two talk bad about those doing right, and those who think they doing right.  Oftentimes, people mistake "Disrespect" for "Reality", their voices sound alike.  "Belittle" is sometimes confused with "Criticism", they are brothers, but "Belittle" gets in way more trouble.  "Betrayal" is that nigga that is sometimes in your house, lives right in the basement, but we are quick to put him on somebody else.  Naw that nigga was with you, when you were talking all sassy to your daddy and he popped your lip, "Betrayal" was standing behind your daddy, but he was egging you on.    There are many who warrant certain things from others, and feel their misconceptions should be rewarded and or amended to their liking.  People often confuse men with boys.  Lets get this straight, niggas will be niggas.  An educated nigga can be found anywhere, in jail, in the street, at your job, and in line at the liquor store.  Never mistake that an educated nigga is spoiled because they do as they see fit.  Niggas out here on the street do the same thing.  A nigga is a nigga is a nigga, please understand that.  You think that a nigga selling weed aint picky about his women???  Get REAL and get in, I'm gonna crack the window.  Females have been picky about men ever since speed bumps hit their concrete.  They have been selective as to who they would talk to, who they would let feel them up in the coatroom, and who they would tattle on.  An educated man might be educated on the ways of women, and is aware that certain women are just eye candy.  No need in getting yourself involved with a pretty gold-digger.  This same nigga might realize that some women are just cool, cool enough to keep as your friends, no need in ruining a good friendship just to be her platonic water spoon.   Niggas are what they are, and our father's children.  Niggas as males are a logical species.  Never mistake the non-chalant for not caring.  A nigga can give you the world, but his muscles might be sore from angling Tibet on his shoulders for 3yrs.  So if you think a nigga is non-chalant about your new found joy, wont you bring your joyous self on over and massage his shoulder, since he "gave you the world" after he won you over, picking up this and that, because you refused to bend over.  He might not be nonchalant just tired from lugging that Range Rover from Angola.   A nigga knows a good meal.  Whether it is a steak dinner, pork chop marinade or a Wednesday afternoon trip to Duff's, never turn your nose at the salad bar.  Females need not worry about "appetizers" because many of you get full off of appetizers, "I'll just have stuffed mushrooms and a salad".  A nigga aint worried about no crab dip, or no Alaskan Crab Legs.  A real nigga will prohibit those appetizer seekers from eating at his table.  Alaskan Crab Legs, nigga please I aint seen Alaska, I'm bout to go down "Ruff N Ready" get a bushel of crabs and some beer.  So if you want them crab legs and dip suit yourself, the proof is in the pudding, and if you dont finish your meal, there is no desert.   "I'm just a nigga in the seatbelt"     "Personals" by Salvador Gabor   We know yall want to know who is "Single and ready to mingle". So we want to provide the resources to connect you with those people.      RaNylah Walker   RaNylah is a life-long citizen of the Stanton Road area of Washington, D.C. Being from the Southeast Inner-City streets, "Nylah-Boo" (As she is affectionately known by friends) is a washingtonian at heart. Gaining her GED in 1989, "Nylah-Boo" joined the Salvador Gabor Project Personals to find a man filled with adventure.  Interests: Playing Spades, sitting on the porch listening to her Anita Baker tapes, speed-walking with her aunt and mother and making "Watergate" Salad  Favorite Foods: Adult Back Ribs, Sausage and a teaspoon of sugar on her collard greens.   Hangout Spots: Any local Bar & Pub Cabarets and all amusement parks that sell funnel cakes.   What she looks for in a man: "I like lightskin boys. I like them classy boys that smoke but never blows the smoke in my face. He has to be romantic. I like a man that will clip my toenails while I watch Ricky Lake".  Goals & Ambitions: "Im tryna get myself together. I do hair on the side, but I need a license to go in a shop and do hair. Im not really good with prom dresses but I did do Keela's dress for her Jr. High Prom. Other than that Im just tryna lose a lil weight so I can be sexy for the summertime."

       "The Game" by Salvador Gabor   Close your eyes (well not literally cause you gotta READ THIS). But, Imagine that its Friday evening. Let's say around 6:30. You just got paid. You dont have that many bills and financial obligations to take care of, but those that you do have, have already been taken care of. So you hop in your car. You have about $300 or $400 to BLOW! Free Money! You got your favorite CD on. You are kissing that cubicle goodbye for the weekend. It's a little traffic outside but your CD has you in a zone. Your cell phone rings. You turn down the music. It might be your homey, good friend or that "special" someone. You pick up the phone. Yall are talking. That person tells you about some restaurant or some place yall can go this weekend. You are "WIT IT". Plus you was going to the mall ANYWAY. And you know when we get new gear, all of a sudden we just wanna go out. So you go to the mall. That $300-$400 is nothing to you! You BLOW it ALL in the mall. Well almost. Let's say you blew $250. Anyway the night goes on. You are where you wanna be. You come back from the mall. Now your CD is on about track number 12. You are speeding. You got your CD loud, $150 in your pocket, you just "popped some tags" on some gear at the mall, and you are headed to the spot. You feel like you cant be stopped. You can do ANYTHING in the world. Right? I would say yes.  For many of us this only happens on "Payday". And "payday" only comes once every 2 weeks. And that little bit of money you were playing with is "CHUMP CHANGE" for real. That lil restaurant, that lil car, that lil girlfriend/boyfriend and that lil JOB you got are all NOTHING for real! You are just a regular person in the eyes of many. But imagine, the same story, but elevated. Instead of it being 6:30 on a end of the week payday, it was EVERYDAY. Instead of that Honda Accord, it was a Maybach or a Bentley. Instead of that $300-$400, it was $30,000-$40,000. Instead of some cubicle, it was a Basketball Court or a Football Field. Imagine that instead of an outfit, you bought the MALL! You felt on top of the world wit that lil $150 and that CD blasting in your lil efficiency car didnt you! Just imagine actually being a star with millions of dollars. Imagine how FAST your life would really be going. Imagine how fast you really would drive and how much you really would spend and how NO ONE else in this world would mean much in this world but you. Because you really would feel like you cant be stopped now. You probably almost could do ANYTHING in the world. Right? I would say yes.  So the next time you watch ESPN, MTV or your local news and you see a rapper, ball player or actor in trouble, just think. Think about how they feel when they drive in their car on "payday". You might just stop wondering "Why all these famous people STAY in trouble!!!!" Everybody on your job wouldnt be gathered in Roberta's office talking about Kobe or R. Kelly or Whitney on Monday morning. Understand that if we dont have self-control BEFORE we become stars we might lose it AS stars. Not to take anything away from the character of those that are in the limelight. We all are human. But maybe you and I are just like the superstars that get into an arguement that ends up in an assault charge. Maybe you and I have been driving drunk. Maybe a sexual act by you and I turned into a misunderstanding and one of us gets accused of rape. Maybe Maybe Maybe. We live regular lives. Our lack of money prohibits us from "cutting a fool" like they do. Maybe if you had $2 Mil in the bank you might not be as calm as you are. Maybe your financial status keeps you as the "nice" person you are. The true test is when you are unleashed. Until you are unleashed to possibly cause madness you will never know. If you dont live their life, dont judge it. Im just saying sometimes we buy their shoes, but we dont know how it feels to be IN them. Or maybe we do???    "Men got to get right" by KM   You got to get right. As I have experienced several relationships in my adulthood. I have come to realize that there are two types of males.  There are many types but generally they fall into two categories.  Real Men and Real Boys. Why is it that men are so afraid of what a good woman has to offer? We offer intelligence, confidence, communication, maturity, and experience.  Any real woman knows how to please a good man. How to sooth his ego, pleasure his senses, relate to his struggle, provide him with his space. How to make him feel confident, secure and loved.   Every woman also knows that in order to reap these benefits a man must make it through the “earning stage”. For those who don’t know or don’t believe it, women do appreciate good men.  What woman wants to be disrespected, betrayed, belittled or taken advantage of? What women want is clear communication, partnership, financial stability, emotional support, love, nurturing and good. They want their man to see them as the sexiest thing in his sight. They want to be stimulated by his conversations and secure in his commitment. Today’s men are so overly consumed by their own aspirations and needs that they often don’t recognize a good woman when they see one. They may acknowledge that “she’s cool” or that she is “bad” (eye candy), but they don’t realize how a little effort, time, and  attention could make them the happiest man on Earth. I have noticed a pattern amongst young professional men. Yes, they have the degrees, the good jobs, the career goals. But they are missing the most important ingredient, the ability to relate to, appreciate, understand and address the needs of a real woman. Why is this? I have my own theory. These young, professional men are spoiled. They realize that they have beaten the odds. They are NOT IN JAIL, NOT ON DRUGS, NOT DEAD.  They feel as though the world is against them and they have made it which makes them as valuable and as treasured as an educated sista.  They believe that they deserve to be pampered, treated, and spoiled. And they do if they earn it.    The truth is congratulations on making it, but the game of love is one that women cherish and is most effective when it is not modernized. Women want to be courted. They want to be treated. They don’t mind having the door held for them.  Minority Women endure a lot by being limited in race and gender. We want our relationships to be different. We have to be strong at work, play the game, firm and convincing. We constantly have to prove that we deserve to be in that position with that title, earning that salary. We have to be twice as good as our female counterparts and four times better than our male counterparts. Men, we need our softer side stroked, our egos caressed, our worries addressed are insecurities made confident. We don’t always want to be the strong one all of the time. We want a strong man to stand by us and for us. To encourage us when we are "doing it" and to check us when we are TRIPPING.  Women are naturally nurturing. We want to take care of the man in our lives. But, most men never see that because they don’t take the steps in the beginning to establish that woman’s trust.   Real Boys do get the girls, but real men keep them. Real boys keep the girl entertained just enough for her to think you have potential to be a good man. But a woman who is dealing with a boy, soon realizes what she is missing the moment a real man steps into her life. Real boys are men who drag their feet. They do just enough to get by. They like you, but don’t take the time to show it.  They do not go above and beyond to let the girl know how they feel about her or where they want the friendship to go. They are nonchalant, not showing emotion either way. They have a selfish mentality an “it is what it is” type of vibe. Real boys make it real easy for real men to slide right in. They are kind of like the appetizers before the seafood buffet. You know the crab dip which is good, but nowhere near as good as the Alaskan snow crabs. Often women don’t even realize they have a boy until a real man steps in the picture.    "The Word of the Day" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   COPULATE  \Cop"u*late\, v. i. [imp. & p. p. Copulated; p. pr. & vb. n. Copulating.] To unite in sexual intercourse; to come together in the act of generation.   Last night Ms. Macy's grandson got shot outside the Circle 7, and neighbors stood outside for 45 minutes, with no sign of the police.  Officer Friendly pulls up, and all you heard was Ms. Macy mutter "aww copulate".

       "Im OVER it" by Salvador Gabor   "Im OVER it". This is another familiar one. Alot of us say this, but we dont mean it. You lose your man/woman........."Im OVER him/her". You getting into a beef with a friend....."Im OVER it". So many times when we have something wrong happen, we struggle. Then when we think everyone is looking and we think that THEY think we are STILL trippin, we blurt out "IM OVER IT". But you are not!  So why do we have to get "OVER" it in the first place. Maybe because we tried going "Through" it and that didnt work. We might have tried to go "UNDER" it and we couldnt see ourselves getting THAT low. Tried to go "around" it but that takes too much time. I mean ENTIRELY too much time. Sometimes we try to turn around. "I wish things were like they used to be". But they are not! Sorry. You gotta always move forward. Never stop and never step back.   So if we cant go around, turn around, go under or go through it, the situation must be sturdy and hard to move. If an empty box is in your way, you can go through it. Just kick it and keep moving. If you approach a tunnel, you walk under it. If you see a pothole, you go around it. If you see the "boogie monster" you turn around cause you're scared. All are examples of when you go around, turn around, go under or go through something. But when you have to get "OVER" it, it must be a hard thing. When you were young and Mr. Randolph's dog was loose, you had to get out of there! Cause "King" was a BIG DOG. If he chased you up the sidewalk you had to get in the street. If the cars were lined up, it was too long of a line of cars to go around. The cars were too low to go under. Too hard to go through and you couldnt turn around cause "King" was behind you. (Sometimes what's behind you can scare you too!) So you had to hop them cars! Jump on top of Glenda's Buick and get to the other side! You might even have to climb a fence, but whatever you do, dont let "King" get close to you!  When getting "Over" something, there are some things you have to do. You gotta put your feet to work. Your feet are the first parts of your body that move when you are climbing. Then in climbing you are putting yourself on a higher level. And last but not least...... when you get to the TOP, the thing that you are getting "Over" sees your TAIL! SO in life, when someone gets you mad, Get "OVER" it. Get your feet to moving, take the HIGH road and in the end, SHOW YOUR TAIL in a nice way!   In life, we dont have time to talk about what's bothering us. You're not gonna call my phone and stand there and say "KING is loose and he out here chasing me!". You're just gonna run and get over that fence. You might call me later but its AFTER you've got over that fence. Maybe you might not tell me until you see "KING" again but he is IN the yard this time. We might walk pass the yard and you might say "WHOOO that dog is fast, I aint even tell you how he chased me and I had to climb Mr. Ellard's fence!". When you talk about it, and you havent got "OVER" it, you will never have time to get over it. And it could turn around to haunt you. Keep it moving and dont let "King" bite you in the butt. I doubt if Mr. Randolph got that mangy dog any rabies shots anyhow. You know Mr. Randolph dont get around too good anymore anyway.      "Announcement from the UNTN"  by Salvador Gabor    The Salvador Gabor Project has just received word that the UNTN, better known as the United Nation of Thug Niggas, has released its new rules, regulations, laws and by-laws. In a statement made late yesterday evening, Rodney "Alley-Way" Robinson, the current President of the organization released this statement to the press:   "Dear Thug Niggas, constituents and outsiders that wanna be gangstas, as the year 2004 progress, we the UNTN feel a need to separate ourselves from this UNION we call America. Many outside influences such as Rap Music, Movies and Black Sitcoms have made it so that everyday Americans feel than can UP and be gangstas and thug niggas. NOT the case buddy! We are here to set the records straight, ONCE and FOR ALL. The following are prerequisites for being a thug nigga":   * Under no circumstances should a Thug Nigga eat Yogurt. Not even during a tonsil infection. Thug Niggas dont even have their Tonsils taken out!   * Thug Niggas are allowed to go to church. They are even allowed to be apart of a church club or organization, BUT no Thug Nigga shall be in a church club that requires wearing a robe or wearing those white gloves.   * Shall only date white women for the sake of spreading "Blackness" throughout the continents   * Sandles are a no-no. Although Flip Flops and socks are permissible.   * Feet, Belly-Buttons and Thighs are not to be exposed by Thug Niggas. Keep socks on, shirts down and shorts below or at the knee at all times   * Thugs do not get Migrane headaches, nor do they take excedrin. Some Kool-Aid, a warm rag and some time directly under an A/C or a Fan will do.   * Thugs can not deem actors such as Taye Diggs, Will Smith, or Boris Kodjoe as their favorite actors. We at the UNTN suggest that John Amos, Redd Foxx and the Ving Rhames' role as "Melvin" in Baby Boy to be used as measuring sticks.   * Thugs shall not drive the following vehicles: Dodge Neons, Hyundai's, any vehicles made by Kia and Geo Metro's. These MUST be cars owned by your "baby mamma" and you must sit "up right" in these cars while driving to denote that it is a rental or it is in the ownership of someone else    These are only a few of the amendments set to be added to the UNTN Constitution. Others shall be made and will be announced as soon as their are passed by Urban Legislature.

       Sal's Corner  "The Black Athlete"    Over the years, I have heard comments about the black athlete. Some good, some bad. Many of our Caucasian counterparts, such as Paul Hornung, Jimmy "the Greek" and others have felt that the black athlete is supreme to its "caucasian" competitors. This may be the case. Who knows? They say "White Men Can't Jump". I dont know, maybe they can, maybe they cant. I cant say that the black athlete is better, I can just show you what makes the black athlete good.   Dogs: A dog chasing you is better than ANY personal trainer. Trust me. Some middle aged white guy yelling at you to "COME ON, KEEP RUNNING" cant compare to a Rottweiler. You see....."URBAN" dogs are much more angry. Black people dont walk dogs. Nor do we feed them correctly. They need dog food, not left over steak and eggs. That upset stomach makes them angry and ready to chase you right into shape   Police: It's nothing like standing next to a crack dealer, the police pull up and he tosses his product. See if the BOdines pull up and he doesnt toss his bags, you really dont have to run. "Officer, I dont know that nigga, he just asked me for a cigarette.....I swear SIR I SWEAR!". But if he tosses the bags, you GOTTA run. You dont want a crack charge. You gotta basketball dream BOY!   Pistols: Robberies, Drivebys, and everyday beefin is prevalent in the hood. You could be getting off the bus........."POW POW POW". You just gotta get low and get to "bookin" down the street. Bookbag and all. Science project and all. You dropped your tokens..........SO WHAT, keep moving. See........thats why black athletes are good at track........we know how to react to a gun from birth. We are not faster than other athletes, we just get a good jump on a gun. Shoot, Michael Johnson WON a meet one time cause he started running when the official PULLED OUT the GUN!   Women: Black men CHASE women. Most men give up if they see a women they like and she is too far. Black men......we RUN. "Shawdy!..... Hey Pink Shirt...... Babygirl.....Slim in the pink! DAG girl you walk too fast!". And we will talk to you and we are outta breath. We just let her know we ran to get close to her.   The Sun: Alot of the black people from the hood know that in the summer, we dont put our kids in no camp! Especially going AWAY to camp. That's unheard of! I went to camp for ONE day in my life. My mother just let me go wit my cousins that day. Every other day, I was outside ALL DAY. See for some of us, the outside is cooler than the inside. See you KNOW the outside is SUPPOSED to be hot, so your mind adjusts your body to that. But the INSIDE aint supposed to be hot. Your child be like 10 years old having strokes in the back room. You see em in the winter and he cant use one-half of his body. His lips be are turned to the left. All because that house is too hot. The fan just makes noise and you get tired of using them church fans. Plus you cant put your head in the freezer cause Uncle Junebug keeping reaching in looking for them gizzards. But that heat brings out the champion in you. You gotta be longwinded in that game of freeze-tag. Can run too much. You learn to ration your stamina. The kid wit A/C can burn out cause he can always go inside, but YOU.......NO buddy you cant!   The Street Light: We always seem to be a lil bit too far from home when that street light comes on. This develops that "clutch" inside of us. Most Black Athletes make the clutch shots at the END of a game. Black Athletes aint scared cause its 5 seconds left. That's plenty of time compared to the street light coming on and you are 5 BLOCKS away. At least the basket is only 15 feet away.   The Bus: You wake up in the morning and the first thing you say is "I aint gonna be late for school AGAIN"............Now hold it..........Im not talking about the "Cheese Bus". If you rode that, you not "hood" enough for this article. Im talking to niggas who was catching the METRObus at 8 and 9 years old. A youth amongst GROWN Men! Amongst drunks, homelessness and the seen-idle. Plus the "cheese bus" MIGHT just wait for you. But the METROBus waits for NO MAN. I've seen that ad on the BACK of the bus MANY of days chasing the bus for school.   The Ice Cream Truck: Im not gonna even talk about this one that much. Just put it like this, if you've chased one on a hot day that "Fat Frog" betta had been worth it! The Ice Cream truck chase is used to develop your long stride.   Niggas: This may be the most influential reason why the black athlete is considered supreme. Plain and simple, OTHER NIGGAS. Owe a nigga some money. Sleep wit a nigga daughter. Say something about a nigga mother. (Oh dont let her be dead either). Or step on a nigga shoes. See not only do you run faster but your alert skills are better. Running and looking out for niggas that you are scared of helps Quarterbacks from getting sacked, Baserunners from getting "picked off" at first, Point Guards from getting dunked on and you not getting hit by and "End" in a good ole game of Dodgeball. You ever seen that nigga you was scared of and you just had to JET. Its that first move. That first dash.    So I cant say which race has the best athletes, but I know the Black Athlete is so good. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"     "HIGH Standards" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr   We as a society often set high standards on our way of living.  From fashion to hair, to cars, and any other measure of success, or perpetration tool, a certain level of worth is placed upon these items.  For the insecure it is hard for one to achieve be satisfied with self-worth, and maintain these high standards.  People always focus on young adults and their buying power and attempt to maintain these high standards.  However nobody ever takes the time to think about pipeheads during this time.   The Expectations of Pipeheads are ever-changing.  Even in their crackish state they must remain clean, hide their crack tendencies, and oftentimes maintain a regular life.  Pipeheads have their own HIGH standards, what makes you think they want to discipline themselves to go along with the norm.  They have a hard enuff time trying to go find Norm on a snowy day.   Pipeheads feel the need to stay fashionable.  Now what might be in-style to you, aint necessarily what Dopefiend JB feels is trendy.  Pipeheads find the newest weirdest outfits.  JB wanders up and down the street in some new San Diego Chargers hat with a big lightning bolt, not that you want the hat, but you want to know where did he get it.  They find the funniest sweatsuits, who wears yellow ski pants?   Can't overlook the ladies, we all know pipeheadettes feel the need to look cute.  There is always the pipeheadette who had or maybe even still has a nice figure, oh but she struts around like it is 1985 and she's an 11th grader at Roosevelt SHS.  Babe if you dont take them stonewash jeans off, and please people dont give the pipeheadettes your old parasucos.  Lady pipeheads get into the throwback game too.  They are the ones wearing that Joe Theismann jersey, and that strange hockey jersey.  Pipeheads are resourceful, and not just when they need 8 more on that rock.   Pipeheads have HIGH standards, double standards, if you will.  So when you see them out there in that old Celtics "Cornbread" Maxwell jersey and their spandex pants, dont laugh, just think, "Tammi tryna do the mutha today".  Chances are they are HIGH and being HIGH is as high a standard they know.

       "The Salvador Gabor Project" by Salvador Gabor      The following is just a brief explanation for this blogspot. Read it and maybe you will get a better understanding of what's going on in here on a daily basis.   The Salvador Gabor Project was initiated from an idea. An idea that this world that we live in can be shaken up and rattled by the minds of people who think in an "akward" fashion. The project's purpose is to look at life from a peculiar angle. This angle can be compared to an object that is balanced at an edge of a table. Although it is at the edge and leaning over the edge to an extent, it never falls over. You may not even know why the object was at the edge in the first place. You may not know if it will fall or not. But, you run over to the table and put your hands down under the table JUST in case it falls. But everytime you think it will fall, it DOESN'T. It never goes quite that far. But your reaction.......that slight sense of fear or quickness to reach down and grab the object stays with you. That's the feel we want from you when you read the postings. I feel that if you know what's coming down the pipe, we may lose your attention.    My goal is to post articles and columns that have two, three, maybe even four meanings. These postings may not always be understood, yet they draw your attention. You may need to read a posting four to five times before coming up with your own interpretation of exactly what is going on. See, the idea is not to change your thinking or change your ways. The idea is to make you stop and wonder for a brief second......"What if?", "Why not?", "How can I/they?" and maybe some other questions that might come to mind when reading the columns. If you read some of the postings, one writer in particular ("Reggie Dinkins, Jr") often refers to jungles and the safari. A person maybe unfamiliar with this "jungle" that they travel through. This maybe their very first time here. Leaves are hitting their face. Branches are clipping them up. Noises have them fearful as to what may attack them. These are all obstacles and factors that may lead one journeyman to turn around. You can only get but so deep before turning around becomes as hard as going forward. The time it takes to go in either direction may become even depending on how deep into the jungle you have traveled. If you choose to go on through this "jungle", your tour guide is always there. You may even need to hold his/her hand. A jungle is not a paved path. As I said, there are objects within the jungle that appear to be standing in your way. These objects are not standing in your way. These objects and so-called obstacles make up the aura and essence of that jungle.    When traveling through a jungle, you can look at is as a messy, slimey, gewey piece of unchartered land OR you can see it as nature and the beautiful landscape that could never be manmade. What makes a trip to the Safari a bad experience is when you focus on what's around you and what it can do to you. What makes a trip to the Safari a good experience is when you focus on what you can get out of the trip. That could be pictures, facing your fears directly or just an everlasting memory. So as you continue to read these postings, understand one thing. The noises, leaves, branches, animals and the other aspects that may appear or be heard in our "jungle" are apart of the element. The Salvador Gabor Project is not Lakeshore Drive, Rodeo Drive or 5th Avenue.........it is a "Jungle".................Now I wouldn't touch those leaves if I were you, poison ivy is rampid during this season.

      "Do You Want This D" Pt. 1  by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       Oftentimes in today's self-centered society people confuse the simplified, misuse the wet-side, and drag dirt in your new ride.  People like to tell you what they want and how they want it.  Be careful what you say, especially if a nigga asks you, "Do you want this D?"   The Underworld known as Mass Transit requires many tactical moves, and formations. So many are concerned with attacking for their own good.  They are so offensive at heart, jump-pushing, run-shoving, and leading with fatty tissues.  Stop being so offensive before you get this D.  I dont act like that on the train so why should you? Do you want this D, you want to see apart of me, that belongs in a tree, nobody wants to act out the early morning monkey.   The young and supposedly sophisticated often think of themselves highly, as anyone should.  However, many of these supposedly sophisticated don't know how to read the D.  They fail to realize a point made doesnt equal a good grade.  Dont tell a lion how to safari, unless you are a bit of a jaguar yourself.  Don't take offense when there is none to be taken.  Do you want this D, I mean some real D, not that nice cover-up you get at the shop de beauty.  Special Teams gets on the field at some point.  Special Teams is the art of understanding special situations a.k.a. "where I'm coming from".  If a person understands your point, don't try to force it, especially if they understand.  Don't force it in, you might be the one who gets chafe.    There are many dazed and confused,  misunderstood with egos bruised  thinking they got it all figured out but accuse you of a short-fuse  explanations of things repeated  don't confuse my mind for my language slightly streeted.  early morning perusing on a topic you never thought of using  snake-bitten by the words my fangers take your mind cruising.  Never misconstrue the office for my zoo,  a queen for a bunk.  got so much offense you think my battleship sunk.  nigga check my shelf and notice my titles,  Run and Shoot, West Coast, a good offense is vital.  but read a lil closer you might see a Matchup Zone, a 4-6, or even a 2-3.  Do you want this D?  If you're offensive then this D you might not like,  cool your jets or get wet next to a dam dyke     If I have offended any with the above passage, then perhaps it is YOU who have the D, and you might be getting too much D.  For those of you who may have found any specific words offensive, pick up a Dictionary.  DUAL meanings separate the misconstrued from the genious     "Fashion Cents" with Ms. Monique    When Its Time To Draw The Line   Hello fashion people and non-fashion people. I'm here to enlighten you all on the latest fashion tips and the fashion "No-No's". OK.......I'm pretty sure you know that the color of this year has is Pink! Now......of course Pink isn't the ONLY color that you have to choose from. So ladies......please lay off of the Pink. Bright neon colors and pastel colors can be used as other color options as well.    Fashion "No-No's"   This has to be my biggest pet peeve..........Ladies PLEASE stop wearing these stretch jeans with the combat boots over top of them like this style is still hip! Yes this WAS the style back in 1999 and 2000 but, not anymore. This year it is all about femininity. Colorful prints and lots of shear ruffle materials. Try wearing a knee length (YES I said knee length) skirt with colorful prints and a "off the shoulder" solid color shirt along with some stiletto heels/sandals that give definition to your legs.  Last but not least, bring out your confidence and fierce attitude that will have everyone drawn to your energy   ** Remember.......you only look good when you feel good. Next week we will discuss what you should and shouldn't wear with undergarments.     "Personals" by Salvador Gabor       Willie Atkins III A.K.A.

      "Thinking Outside the Box"  by Salvador Gabor    During my college years, I remember people referring to a term/phrase that was catchy and cool to say. That term is "Thinking Outside the Box". From what I was told, the term dealt with the idea of ridding yourself of mental restraints. Eliminating the idea of being trapped in a small, narrow and straightaway mindset. "You gotta think outside of the box!". I bought into that system to a certain extent. You'd never see me in some psychodelic tye-dye shirt and a brown sport coat with some lowtop converse but, I did believe in expanding on my thought patterns.   But what is a box? A Box for some can be a restraint. A box could be a birdcage or a jail cell. A box could be a set of boundaries. Maybe a crib or a playpen for a child that cant be left unsupervised. A box can be the pager on your ankle which goes off if you leave a certain area which is your imaginary box. This is the perception of a box to many people........ well that is.....to the people that say "think outside the box". These people dont want to conform. They want to be free. And they are free to want to be free. These are usually the people who say "I cant see myself working for nobody". Many of these people want their own businesses or they want to work from 12 P.M. to 5 P.M. with a 2-hour lunch break. Thinking "outside of the box" makes things REAL simple doesn't it?????   A box can also be a resource. Boxes are used to move objects from one place to another. Those cans of beans that you take to the goodwill aren't so hard to carry when you have a box, now are they?  It's much easier to store those old records in the basement if you have a box, now isn't it? It's much easier to lug that big ole big screen from "Best Buy" if it's in a box, right? How bout that bike for your kid? What if the sales rep just handed you the parts all in your hands? A box might not always be such a bad idea.   The idea of a box is that it is used to transport and store what you need. It's taken out once you need it and used and then the remains are put back into the box. The "Box" in our world represents authority and rank. Sometimes we need authority and rank in our lives. It's cool to "do your own thang" to a certain extent. But no authority means no rules, which means no structure, which means chaos and confusion. People who talk too much are people who have never been ignored or have just not been told to SHUT UP. Kids who act up constantly probably just need to go outside and get a "switch" and then put across someone's lap. A person who always wants to fight has probably never had his or her teeth KNOCKED OUT. Structure is put in place for proper reasoning.   Now, there is nothing wrong with thinking "outside the box". Just remember, the box transports and stores everything until the RIGHT TIME. You cant be an entry level worker talking about "Im gonna think outside the box". Sit back and let "the box" transport you to a higher level. Once you get there, then you can be taken out of "the box" and used. Sometimes, you have to stay IN a system, establish yourself within that system and THEN move out.   So the next time your life calls for you to buy all those cans of pork & beans, without that box, you might drop those cans. And black toe nails aint cool when you are wearing sandles.

      "Lemme Get a Sheet of Paper"  by Salvador Gabor       Remember that saying......."Lemme get a sheet of paper?". We used to say that in school. You'd go to a class that was kinda boring and not care at all. The class wasnt important.......well at least to you it wasnt. The teacher was boring. But, in order to look like you were doing SOMETHING, you'd ask your buddy for a sheet of paper. Who knows what you would do with that sheet. You MIGHT takes notes. You might SEND notes to the pretty girl in class. You might draw your friend's big head on that sheet of paper. Who knows?? But asking for that sheet meant nothing. It was just going to determine how you would spend your next 50 minutes in that boring class.     Well some might say, "What is the significance of paper?". Paper is used throughout our society. Money, licenses, contracts, and degrees are ALL important documents on paper. But what is the value of a sheet of paper? Has it gotten to the point where asking for a sheet of paper means doodling on it? Is ONE sheet of paper still valuable in this society?  Lets take some of the examples of paper that we used earlier.   Let's talk about money. Money is a type of paper. But, how valuable is it? My mother once told me "Being nice can get you places that money cant". It may seem hard to believe but its true. Money isnt ALWAYS the answer. Me being a black man in America........I am educated, skilled and I'm a great learner. Its very possible that I could become rich and successful. What if I join a country club.......or should I say TRY to join a country club? Does my money make it a sure bet that I'll get in? I would be a First-Generation "rich man" in my family. My grandfathers weren't rich. My father isn't rich. Some societies and clubs require that your family be drenched in wealth before you can be deemed as fit to enter. Do you think Lebron James or "50 Cent" can just UP and join certain societies? Naw, I dont think so. They both come from the hood and I couldnt see LeBron's mother sipping Tea with no uppidity ladies. I dont see the Augusta Country Club playing "Go Shawdy" anytime soon. Nor do I see the golfers wearing LeBron James Jerseys while playing 18 holes. Not to say that eventually these two stars wont ease their way in. Their older counterparts, Michael Jordan and "Jay-Z" have begun to brush shoulders with the big shots. But it isnt JUST the money. They've gained the respect after years of carrying themselves like class acts. You cant just win the lottery coming out of Milwaukee or Detroit in the slums and think that you can go anywhere you want. Un uh, no sir.  That "paper" dont mean as much as you think.   What about licenses? You might have a driver's license, a gun license or a marriage license. You might have all three. But if you just shot somebody coming from your mistress' house and you get pulled over for speeding, none of those licenses mean anything. You shot somebody. So what that you have a license?? You have a license to carry a gun, not to shoot someone. You were speeding. So what that you have a Driver's license?? You have a license to drive, not to be wreckless. You just came from your mistress' house. So what that you are married?? You didnt think about that license 45 minutes ago.   Let's go onto contracts. A contract is a document with agreements included. Two or more parties come together and agree on the stipulations of the contracts. Their agreement is documented by signatures. You'd think that this is etched in stone right?......uhhh Not quite. Do you know that on some jobs, companies agree to offer you X,Y and Z and at the end of the contract there is a clause. The clause says "We reserve the right not to fulfill X,Y and Z". What kinda sense does that make? I sign a contract that says I get X,Y, and Z but, then again the job doesnt have to give me X,Y, and Z??? Houses have contracts too. You sign a mortgage. You pay on that mortgage. You eventually own that house. But if the local government decides to build a stadium on your property, unless you want your living room to be the visitors' locker room......you're gonna have to move. The same idea applies if the city wants to build a subway stop on your property. I'd hate to hear "Ladies & Gentlemen please refrain from leaning on all doors......Next Stop...Silas' Room........"   What about degrees? Alot of us paid $60,000 for a sheet of paper. Alot of us are STILL paying for that sheet of paper. Some of us went to two or three schools to get that sheet of paper. The ink that it took to write your name on that sheet with the school name and the President's signature is worth about $2. I tell ya, thats some expensive paper. It must be made outta Eqyptian cotton on something. I just wonder sometimes what is this particular paper all about????   My point to all of this is that, the power is in the person, not the paper. That sheet means nothing if I dont have control over the situation. If I have some money and no clout behind it, im just some guy looking to spend money. Ever heard the phrase "your money's no good here"? Ask that question to some black folks that lived during segregation. Ask a gay person if their marriage license means anything in certain states. Ask a college graduate working at Denny's if their degree means anything.  So I wonder how many of you still put value in a sheet of paper? The powers that be look at your sheet of paper like that kid in the class that bores him. Sometimes I think we waste our time and money buying toilet paper. All the other papers we have seem fit enough to wipe ourselves with. "Boooooooossssshhhhhhhh"........Oh yeah, dont leave the toilet seat up and for God's sake put the exhaust on!!!!!!!     "Lemme Get a Sheet too" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr  Lemme get a sheet too,  Would you pass the sheet to me,  a piece of top paper so I can twist this doobie.  People feel the need to jot stuff down,  history notes on Board of Education and some dude named Brown.  All the while they write stuff down,  they miss real reason of how it all went down.  Lemme get a piece of paper and I will take you to town,  pick up some eggs some milk, and play my numbers by six.  Matter of fact drop that paper and gimme a stick,  It looks as though I got some gum on my shoe grip.   Lemme get a sheet too,  Wont you gimme just one,  naw I aint concerned about the spiral rippings Ms. Johnson.  Now let me get that piece and I will show you its worth,  I'll rip it and tear it and send it back to the earth,  Why did I do it, well its simple and plain.  If you can do it dont document it, just execute the insane.  Business plans to crazy man bump that just pay me,  A swoosh is just a dinner spoon without the gravy.   Lemme get a sheet too,  Or maybe even two,  I need a receipt for that number you gave me.  Numbers on napkins are worth more than wide-ruled baby.  Wide-ruled means study group, that you wanna borrow my book,  But that there napkin, that is a different sorta look  "call me round ten" tone of voice saying she'll give you the nook.  Napkins can be the basis for a binding contract,  a kinky waitress attracted by your binding contact.  Maybe even a figure that will get you to sign that car contract,  0 down, no monthly payments might find your pockets Koons attracts.   Lemme get a sheet too,  whether its top, or spiral  it's what's on the inside that is what is vital,  tricky words, sticky herbs, or a pill named Midol  The man behind the paper tells the world's survival,  Mr. Xerox or that nigga whose words you quoting  or even that nigga down 58th whose reefer you toking.  Spend less time with sheets, and more with your memory  unless you on the comode the same color as emory.

       Sal's Corner "Time to Check My Crackhouse" Vol. 1    Reggie spoke about pipeheads in his article "High Standards" back on 4/5/04. I think we've ALL seen crackheads. You might know em as "Fiends", "Crackheads", "Dopeheads", "Cluckers", or just "Niggas thats on it". No matter how you know them...YOU KNOW THEM. Lets talk about em.......   * Memory: Crackheads have no memory. That's why they keep tryna get this $20 bag for $17. Crackheads will walk up on you, congratulate you on finishing school THEN ask you "when are you graduating?" the NEXT day.  * "Sweetie": "Sweetie" is a word of choice for female crackheads. It's never "boo" or "honey" or "child" (pronounced CHYLE).   * Purse: The purse of a female crackhead is held close. Lady crackheads who walk the street MUST have a purse to keep their crack addiction "on the low". You have to maintain secrecy on these streets.               * Sweaters: You wont see a crackhead in a T-Shirt unless its July. The months of June and August will see a sweater from a crackhead. If it gets a lil warm under the collar, sleeves may be rolled up. The sweater may even come off, but initially the sweater is worn  * Watches: Crackheads DONT wear watches. They tell time by the affects of their high. If a crackhead gets hight at 4:00 P.M., they KNOW their high should last 2 hours, so when they get to feenin', it must be 6:00 P.M.  * Hats: Female Crackheads: The Bucket Style Hat with a flower ontop. The Flower is a little stale. Now the material of choice is denim. Disclaimer: Many women do their gardening in Denim Hats, but if I see you at the corner store wit some "20/20" in your hand, I know you hittin that pipe. Male Crackheads: Any hat that straps is sufficient. Fitted caps add more sweat and arent as easy to take off as strap hats are. Male crackheads tend to take off their hats many times during the day. They are mostly seen in Fishing, Negro League and Newport Cigarette hats.  * Vehicles: Vehicles of choice....... Chevrolet Corsicas, Plymouth "K" Cars and convertible Dodge LeBarons. The LeBaron's bring back memories of the old days for crackheads. Crackheads tend to gather and fellowship around older droptop models of cars.  * Jeans: Crackheads never wear BLUE jeans. Either ashy black or almost white jeans.   * July Apparel: Like I said before, ONLY in July do they shed the Sweaters. Fellas may have on a 1987 Ashford & Simpson World Tour Tee or maybe a 1990 Detroit Pistons Championship TEE with the Caricatures on the front. Ladies, you might catch some of our beautiful Crackhead Queens in a jean short set. The white sandles with the jean shorts and the cut-off jean top. The top is sleeveless buttoned down top with denim material down towards the waist that can be used as a pretty knot.   * "Hand-Me-Down": Crackladies tend to wear fake Iceberg Shirts with stretch pants that their daughters wore years ago. Crackmen might keep on their blue "working" jumper but have on their son's 1997 Nike Foamposites.   These are just a few pointers on who, what, when, where, why and how to spot a "pipehead". Next we will discuss the usefulness of a "pipehead".

       "One Monkey Dont Stop No Show" By Salvador Gabor    The other day I had my lil nephew in the car with me. He asked me about some random guy that he just felt I SHOULD know. He kept going on and on......."You dont know SUCH & SUCH!" "Man you GOTTA KNOW him!". I stopped and said "DO THAT NIGGA KNOW ME?" "You run and ask him that.........that's what you do!". And again I say "One monkey dont stop no show". Granted he is young, but as adults sometimes we dont realize that "One monkey dont stop no show".  I respect everybody. If you are a star, I respect your status. Stars work hard to get to where they are. I'm not gonna lie, if I see a star in public, I will tell my friends. That's not a big deal. But some take it too far. I wont get into what they do. But.........."One monkey dont stop no show"  Sometimes it doesn't have to be a star. It could be another person you know. I had a friend tell me recently that a guy walked up to him and said "How can I get all the girls like you?". Now I was SHOCKED. Because my friend said that the guy was serious! Well to that guy, if you are reading this.............thats ONE sure way to know you WONT be getting them. I dont use this word but that my friend is the characteristics of a true prankster. And again I say "One monkey dont stop no show"  Now this one is the catch. This is the one we hate to admit. Fellas and Ladies..........we've all done it. You see the one for you walking down the street. Looking good, walking good, just all wrapped up for the taking. In your mind, you've already thought up what YOU think they are about. "Man, she looks like she is intelligent. She probably stay at home and read all day. She probably a good girl". Or how about the ladies. "Oooh he is fine, he probably has a career, maybe he owns his own business, he and his friends probably travel cause he looks so cultured". Please get to KNOW that person. Dont assume from afar. And when you get up on eeeemmmm, check your assumptions against what's really going on. And if they are not feeling you.........."One monkey dont stop no show"  Im not trying to say act bigger than what you are. Just have some confidence within self. People come and go. There's only ONE person that you will be guaranteed to be linked to forever............thats YOU! If you walk in a place and somebody gets on a loud speaker and says "Michael Jordan is IN HERE!"...............walk up and tell em, "SLIM....... IM IN HERE, SHOUT ME OUT!"    An Interview with "Uncle Bub" by Salvador Gabor      Charles "Bub" Dennis has been around the block a few times. "Bub", as he is affectionately know by his family, doesn't do much with himself. he is the typical guy that walks in your local barbershops, corner stores and neighborhood pool halls and taverns with his "dress clothes" on but is not going, headed or hasnt been anywhere important. I've always wondered what "Uncle Bub" does and what is his goal. I got a chance to sit down with the fella and to see what is the deal with him   Salvador Gabor: UNCLE BUB!!!!!! Man how are you??? Did I come at a wrong time?  "Uncle Bub": Youngster, Im just enjoying this here sun. It's a nice day. You caught me just as I was pressing my slacks here.  SG: Well I'm sure you dont want to do an interview in boxers and suspenders now Bub do ya?  UB: Oh no, just give me one second. (calls his wife).......CAROL. Hey CA-ROLL, fix me a bit of them grits.  UB: Go on now Im ready  SG: So what have you been up to?  UB: Ive been working hard man. Working real hard!  SG: I didn't know you had a job Uncle Bub  UB: No son I dont have a job. I've been working hard at hitting the number down at the liquor store.  SG: No luck on the straight box huh?  UB: I keep playing 6-1-7-8! That's my son's birthday. That nigga aint never been nuttin' no way. I see why I keep losing.  SG: Have you ever won any money before.  UB: Of course son, everyone wins every once in a while. I hit the number for $750 one Wednesday. I took my wife to Atlantic City that weekend. I let her drive up as I took some swigs on that Christian Brothers. I bought these glasses with that money too.  SG: EK's huh. Pretty nice  UB: My wife bought me a pair a few years ago. But I broke em when I slammed em at a card game. Niggas love to renig like its sweet!  SG: So I see that you've ironed your clothes now. They look nice, you must have somewhere important to go?  UB: Yeah it's Friday. All the fellas hang out by the barber shop and shoot the breeze. Might catch a lil air and flirt with the bus driver on her route.  SG: You're married Bub?!?!  UB: I flirt son. I JUST flirt. Now when I start doing the other "F" word with the bus driver, then we gotta problem. That's whats wrong with the youth. Yall take it too far. Entirely! I just say hello and maybe sometimes I buy her a soda or a honey bun. Nothing more.  SG: Ok ok. So what else is going on for today?  UB: That's about it. I gotta cabaret to go to tomorrow. BYO  SG: Bring your own liquor  UB: Yes and no. BYO is just Bring ya Own! Whatever it is. If its heroin.........Bring Ya Own. I dont know much about it but some niggas do it. Just bring it, and dont expect to get it from nobody else.  SG: You have nice clothes, nice cars and plenty of money.........How do you get all of this stuff with no job?  UB: I draw unemployment and a disability check. That serves me well. I just can't go to my dancing night on Monday's no more. Since I draw disability I can't be seen dancing. I used to be on that show on Public Access........"Tony and his Dancing Friends". We used to jam to the oldies and do line dancing and so forth. But since I got disability coming in.........Disability is messing wit Dis Ability!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA  UB: Look here, Big Ray and sleepy bout to come get me so we can run down to the crab shack and get a bushel or two. Im a see you later baby  SG: Ok Unk.   So there we have it. Another nigga who has NO job, nothing to do and collects TWO checks from the good folks in our Government. Sometimes I wonder, "WHY do I have aspirations and goals and dreams?". The only dream "Uncle Bub" is having is that dream that he left them drawls with the brown stain in em ontop of the washer and not in the "to be cleaned by ME" pile.

       "Pimpin" by Salvador Gabor    "Im a pimp". "Im a pimp by blood......". My car is "pimped out". Im out here "Pimpin these hoes". Oh yeah playboy? You's a "pimp" huh? "Pimp", "Pimpin" and "Pimped out" are some of the most coonified words (yes coonified is a word, I made it up so it's a word). People beat these words into the ground. Everybody is a "pimp", but nobody wants to be a "ho". I thought about the word "Pimp" and I want to talk about what it means and maybe some of these so-called "pimps" might just turn out to be "hoes".  When you look at the idea of a "pimp" or the idealogy of "pimpin" it deals with a simple concept. There is a product, gift and/or talent that has not been tapped into. This product. gift and/or talent may not even been known. You may not know that it lies within you. Yet, someone else sees your product, gift and/or talent. That person is your "pimp". That "pimp" may not be able to do what you do when it comes to that product, gift and/or talent but, he or she provides the avenue for you to begin to make a profit from it.   "Pimps" come in all sizes, shapes and colors. Selling sex is just a small portion of true "pimpin". Sports Agents, Temp Agencies, Bankers, Lawyers, the government and many other professions and industry use "pimp" tactics.   Sports Agents and managers tell you what your schedule should be. They negotiate your contract and often times they see your talent before you do. You just go out and shoot ball. But it's you shooting that ball that makes him money. You can easily handle your own schedule, but can he dunk from the dotted lines? You can easily read your own contract and consult an agent on a hourly basis but can he take a point guard off the dribble and penetrate to the hole for the score?   Temp Agencies are some of the biggest, most gorilla pimps in Corporate America. Who do you know that finds a job for you and takes half of your check EVERY pay period? I've found a few dudes job placement in the past, the most I got was a thank you and a strong dap. But temp agencies need that 50%. I worked for a temp agency once. The temp agency grossed $1,000/week and I came home with about $400. Now I figured it out. At the time, I was getting about $100 per week taken out for the little bit of insurance and taxes I had as a temporary worker. So the agency taxed from the $1000 as a whole. That left "us" with $900. These "pimps" didnt even give me $450! They took half of the base amount, which is $500 and slid me the remaining $400. It's sick, aint it man!   The Banking systems is "pimpin" in a real kinda way. Now check this out. I ask you.........to hold my money..........and when I want it........I gotta come to you...........but if I dont come by 5:00 P.M...............I gotta stand outside your house and put my card in the mailbox and hope that nobody robs me while I'm outside your house? Sense? It makes none to me. Dont get me wrong, I have a bank account. But, I dont understand how in this world, I HAVE to have a bank account to get any possessions. You have to have credit cards and bank accounts. BUT, with my bank account, these clowns charge me for using MY money. The game is vicious. So just to break it down so far...........I HAVE to have a bank account and I have to pay charges for them holding my money. Now check this out...........for those who dont know, the bank doesnt put your money in a safe and write "Silas Grant" on the front of the box. They take ALL of the money, pile it together and hope we all never come in at the same time to withdraw. So your money is NOT there all the time. While we let our money sit, the banks re-invest it and make interest off of it. That is why we gain interest when we open savings accounts. But the profit that they get from the re-investment is HUGE. Now they take chances and risks with thousands of our dollars, but when we take a chance and overdraw by two or three dollars, they charge us $30-60. But ITS MY MONEY. Why can't I owe you a dollar or two for a day or so? It's "pimpin" at its finest.  I have friends who are pursuing the Law field. Because of this I have a better appreciation for lawyers. But, let's be real. I caught the charge, let me talk to the judge. Forget law books and rules, because when it's all said and done, those laws and books are thrown out half of the time anyway! Law depends on the dude on trial. If the judge chooses to implement the appropriate punishment, he can. It's really in the hands of the jury and the judge. I feel as though, Im a pretty likeable person. I can "holla" at the judge. I should be able to go see him in his quarters, "dimes" or "nickels" if I want to. But I gotta pay this dumb dude next to me $200/hr to do the same thing that I can do. And then they got court appointed lawyers. These guys must have went to the Harlem Law School for repeat-petty act criminals. I'd rather have a judge "appoint" me to a cell before I get a court appointed lawyer. These fools know less about the cases than I do. We're both just standing there........shrugging our shoulders. I can talk and represent for my own self!  The government is wild too. They make you pay taxes but you cant tell them where your tax money can go. If I owe $823.57, then I should be able to assign my $823.57 to where I want it to go. I dont want a new Baseball stadium in D.C. I'd rather my money go to a pay increase for teachers. But I'm paying my taxes so ANOTHER sorry D.C. team can come here. Lemme just vent for a second............THESE CLOWNS in D.C. are begging for the MONTREAL EXPOS to come here????????? They are the worst team. Yet, my $823.57 is funding it. And then let's not talk about the war. I can't shoot who I want to shoot. I can't even have a gun. But, when the government has beef, they can shoot.........better yet they can draft ME to shoot. So when I was beefin' wit "Lil Boogie" and em down the street, the guns was a problem. Now, you want me to kill Akbar and it's alright?   Just understand one thing. The biggest "pimps" dont wear purple suits and stand on stage with rappers. And the biggest "Hoes" dont wear see-thru dresses either. If you want to know what a real "hoe" wears, you may not have to look far.       Ladies and Gentlemen......back in January when we started this spot, I promised that we would have another writer along with Me, Reggie, Gartrelle and Lonnie. His name is "The Counseler" or you can call him Martel. It took him 4 1/2 months to get an article posted. Let's hope it doesn't take another 4 1/2 for the next one.      “Miss You, Miss You, Miss You, Miss You, Miss You”-Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes  By Martel S. Cunningham, Ph.D.         We all know how it feels to lose something of value – IT SUCKS.  Whether it be something irreplaceable – like a close friend or loved one, something that took a lot of money or effort to produce - like the paper that kept u up all night to type, and was lost right near the end when the power flashed, or something relatively simple like a wallet or a fare card in the backseat of your buddies’ car.  Whatever the case may be, losing something that is important is never fun.  In some extreme cases it can even be accompanied by acute feelings of grief and heartache.   Many times losses are unpreventable, and they almost never come at a good time.  However there are those rare occasions where we actually make a loss worse by failing to take a single action that could very easily make the situation better. Recently I’ve been working with a newlywed couple that that was on the brink of divorce.  The problem began   when they lost the remote control to their bedroom television.  This may seem strange but this couple’s ENTIRE lives were programmed around the tube.  The husband found himself frequently late for work as he didn’t have the remote to grab for in the morning when the alarm clock went off.   And the wife stopped spending as much time in the bedroom because the husband refused to change the channel from ESPN.  Even their sex life was interrupted.  Look, I don’t care who you are and how much you love thongs, but watching The Ultimate Sumo Wrestling Championship on pay-per-view until the “after-hours” movies come on is a sure-fire way to take the Spice out of any pre-sexual activities.  Fortunately,   I convinced the husband to break down and buy that All-4-One remote, and I haven’t heard from them since.   In any event, going through a loss if tough if and if you are not prepared or not able to adjust it just might overwhelm.  In her book On and Death and Dying, Elizabeth Kübler-Ross offers 5 stages that can be helpful fore those who experience a great loss in their life.  The quicker you are able to get through these stages the better you will be able to cope with the loss.  Using the “lost farecard" scenario from earlier here is my adapted version of her stages:    denial  – self explanatory; “HOLD-UP I KNOW I aint loose my fare card.  Naw its gotta be right  in my back pocket…..    anger  – getting mad and blaming somebody else;  “(sucks teeth) That nigga Darnell always be rollin out after he drop me off, he know I’m twisted right now! Niggas don’t wait after they drop you off no more.  MAN its cold out here! Wait till I see that nigga again I’m gonna fu….”    bargaining  -   the last “ditch-effort” to overcome the loss; “(spinning around) Aight, I thought I put in my back pocket but maybe I missed and it slipped in between my belt and got stuck on a loop….”    depression  -  The full impact sets in; (sobs) Man I’m gonna have to bum $2.15 from somebody and it aint NO big girls out here.  Why I had to come waaay out here neway? I know these whitees aint gonna help me either. At least if I was in the city I might see somebody I know”    acceptance  - come to grips with the loss and makes preparation for it; “’xcuse me can I borrow a…, ‘xcuse me sir ‘xcuse ma’am can I borrow a…. Man my girl gonna be pissed when she come and get me. Well at least I’m still drunk (shrugging shoulders)”    Hopefully these stages will help you or someone you know if they are grieving over some type of loss  .   **Remember **  Life is a journey and along the way you’re going lose some things as well as find some things before you reach your final destination.  Sometimes what you find will easily replace what you lost, and you will be better for it. Other times what you lose will leave huge void in your life forever and you will never be the same.  But always remember whatever you lose or find.............without your farecard your journey will never begin.   Signing off until next time - yours truly,  - Martel S. Cunningham, Ph.D.

       "I wanna be Rich!" by Salvador Gabor   I wanna be rich! I'm telling you, I DO! I want it all. Don't we all? I had a friend say to me one time "I'm gonna be rich! R-E-C-H..........Rich Nigga Rich!". The poor boy didn't even realize that he spelled the word rich wrong! But, it didnt matter because he wants to be rich. So, what exactly is the fascination with being rich? People want to be recognized and appreciated. I've always felt that the best way to show appreciation for someone's efforts is by paying them. When you do a good job nothing is better than some money in your pocket. When you cut the old lady's grass on your block, she offers you money but, you dont want to take it. But, her offering money is a sign that she appreciates your work. Now it's always that "other" old lady who wants to give you a soda and a piece of pound cake for your work. She can keep that, as far as I'm concerned!   But seriously, there has to be a deeper meaning to it all. I thought about why I wanted to be rich. I figured that I wanted attention. I want to "come through" in the Bentley Coupe with the top down. I want people to do "double takes" when I ride through. I want people to say "Dag, Sal got that Bent and he is doing it!". I want to be the topic of conversation when it comes to luxury. But is it worth it? I truly believe that the day will come when I will have an opportunity to become rich. I could do it real simple. Get the money, take care of my family and just live life to the fullest. Nothing physical or materialistic would be an obstacle. Anything that I want, I could get. This would be the easy way out. But couldn't I do something more productive than that?  I think back to the idea of me "coming through" in the Bentley. The "oohs" and the "aahhs" that I would hear from friends and family couldn't match the idea of me actually helping THEM get to that point. I often battle with the idea of how I would spend my money. I look at the Bentley and I say to myself "If I am a multi-millionaire, what is $400,000 for a Bentley?". It's nothing! But, $400,000 can be used in so many ways. Sometimes I'd rather take that $400,000 and pay for 4 kids to go to school. I've always had a wild way of thinking. I wouldn't take 4 so-called "smart" kids and pay for school. I'd take maybe 4 drug dealers who had no reason to or thought of going to school. Taking $100,000 and paying for a kid to go to school who already has scholarship offers is like killing one bird with TWO stones. I'd rather walk up to 4 guys who have no direction and say "How would you like to go to college?". This sounds crazy right? But listen. If I offer a person a chance at a better life who seemed to have NO chance, the chances are, that person will be more likely to appreciate my investment. When they complete school, they would be more than willing to work with me and help me grab more and more kids. They would almost feel obligated to be apart of my plan because they had no options before I came and offered them this chance. It sounds like a stretch but, it's possible. At the end of it all, spending $400,000 on 4 kids will make my money more valuable than a Bentley. That same Bentley that will cost me $400,000, will only be worth about $250,000 in 4 to 5 years. But those 4 kids who I spent $400,000 on could be worth ANY amount of money. You might invest into the next superpower businessman or businesswoman. Your money may go to providing an education for the person who will discover a cure for a disease. More importantly, you invested in one person but, that person may spend their entire lives investing in others. You took time out with ONE person but, doing that lead to your "investment" becoming a resource to others in this world for years to come.  I dont know about anyone else but, it feels good to ride good, look good and feel good. But, the ultimate feeling is to look back and know that someone else is "shining" because of you. Instead of me "coming through" with the Bentley, I'd much rather have 4 or 5 youngsters that I helped get to a better place in life "come though" with something nice. That's a feeling that money can't buy. It's the idea of building a foundation. It's too much money coming in and out of our community for only one man to be worth $300 Million from selling rap cd's or playing basketball and he's not turning around and providing our youth with educational resources and positive experiences. How can one man be worth that much and not share SOME of it? That's the difference between being rich and just having alot of money. Having alot of money is blowing every dime of it. Being rich is being fulfilled. Rich is being able to spread the wealth without feeling hurt about doing so. So if you ask me, YES, I want to be RICH. And YES, I want that Bentley, the Phantom AND the Maybach (if I could have ALL THREE). But, I would never get those items JUST for others to "ooh" and "ahh" at me.  Always remember, pick someone else up as you climb. Strive to be the reason that another man elevates. When you die, the money is gone but, leave a legacy for someone to follow. The most that some rims spinning will do, is keep the next man dizzy.        "The Fabulous Life of....."   by Salvador Gabor      Rolan "Sharp Suit" Nelson  The Salvador Gabor Project presents the Fabulous Life of Rolan "Sharp Suit" Nelson. "Sharp Suit" got his name from the fact that he wore Shark Skinned suits. But, you know niggas dont talk correctly, so he thought all his friends were complementing him. He thought they were saying "Hey Sharp Suit" but it was really "Hey there go that nigga Shark Suit". Anyway "Shark Suit" turned into "Sharp Suit" when all the ladies began to attach themselves to Rolan and the fellas who teased him turned jealous and bought sharp shark suits themselves. Rolan has always been the premiere playa.  His name should have been Rollin', cause that's what he does. So today, we go deep into the life of Rolan "Sharp Suit" Nelson.   Attire: When Rolan goes shopping, it's only the finest gear for a fine young playa like himself. Stores like Cavalier, Harold Pener and Target could get up to $200 in purchases of 3 piece suits. Oh no, he is not a cheap spender! What is $30 for a pair of J.C. Penney loafers???? This is Rollin Rolan we are talking about. He's no Joe Blow off the street. He's also into pastel colored suits. He said he read the "Fashion Cents" on the Salvador Gabor Project last week and he is definetely gonna pick up on the pastel colors even more. He has his own personal shopping assistant, who has introduced him to Gucci Buckets and XXXXL Prada shirts on Canal Street in New York City.  Restaurants: When "Sharp Suit" goes out to eat, he dines in fine fashion. It's no McDonalds for him. Its only Checkers for Rollin Rolan! His favorite burger is the "Champ Burger". Oh yes, and that's WITH cheese. Once again, what is $.45 to a playa like "Sharp Suit".  Women: "Sharp Suit" is the don when it comes to women. He even got his main woman Emma Jean an efficiency apartment in the Section 8 area of Southeast D.C.  Traveling: "Sharp Suit" only goes to the BEST resorts. It is rumored that he has a "time-share" in the Calliope Projects in New Orleans. When he is out of town he uses his Super 8 Motel Platinum Card and has access to the finest suites on the 1st floor.   Pets: Rolan has a Doberman named "Rudy" that lives as a king. "Rudy" doesnt eat dog food. "Rudy" eats exactly what the rest of the Nelson's eat. "Rudy" eats eggs, donuts, now-a-laters and any other food from the table that he can get his hands on.   Assets: Well Rolan doesnt have a job, but he can play some spades. On an average day, "Sharp Suit" can bring home $50 - $65 a day by playing spades. Of course he loses on certain days too but it doesnt stop ole Rolan  Parties: It aint no cabaret till Rolan steps in the place. His favorite drink is Martell. "Why go top shelf, that's too high to be reaching for" says Rolan. He bought 17 bottles of Mad Dog 20/20 for his 23rd Birthday and he wasnt selfish. He even let the ground have something to drink. Between him peeing on himself and his suit and throwing up in the dirt in the parking lot, the whole world got a sip of some drank that night   Keep your mouse tuned it to the Salvador Gabor Project as we unveil the fabulous lives of other not so famous celebrities..........that's all for now ladies and gentlemen!

      Technology News by Salvador Gabor     T.I. 825   SprintPCS and Tay Jewelers have came together to create the latest trend in the fashion/technology industry. Tay Jewelers, a jeweler that has been known for creating the finest rubberband and wrist and neckwear for the hoodstars across the U.S. has designed a rubberband for the head. This band is being created so that you can have your cell phone attached to your ear without holding it and possibly receiving a ticket from your local police force.  Many laws have banned cell phone use in cars because phones hampers the drivers ability to control the vehicle with both hands. This new invention the "T.I. 825" will eliminate any discomfort of cell phone use in vehicles. Also the bigger problem has been solved. People no longer have to walk around looking like a secret service agent or Bobby Brown. Also you eliminate the possibility of people thinking that you are talking to yourself. With the phone directly attached to your ear people know that you aren't crazy.  Long-time cell phone users are wondering if the original cell phones, which are bigger than the current sized phones, will be adequate for the "T.I. 825". That question remains to be seen.     Automobile News by Salvador Gabor  In life, everyone longs to look good. We all cant be filthy rich but we can live lavishly on our level. The following are a few items that you can use to look good, feel good and play you part.    The New Chrysler 300 C  If you've been outside in the last 5-6 days, you've had to see at least 8 of these on the streets. This is the hottest mid-range vehicle to touch the concrete in quite some time. The 300 C ranges from $23K to $33K. This is not a bad price for a car that looks similar to the Rolls Royce Phantom. I call it "The Baby Phantom". This will probably be the car of choice for many young people for the months to come.     Kia Amanti  YES, ladies and gents........KIA has a "Big Body". NO not Kia that lives in the corner house down the street. Kia the car company. It was a total shock to me. But, for a price of $22K - $25K, this is not a bad pick up either. I could see this vehicle being more suitable and angled towards females. I cant see a grown man saying "Yeah I just bought this KIA". It's not a good look for the fellas. My suggestion is that the wife get the Amanti and the husband go out and get the 300 C.     The Chevette  The only difference between the Corvette and the Chevette is the C O R. A vette is a vette is a vette. What a sports car the Chevette is? This solidifies the word sports car. Imagine being out on the open road and popping the clutch on a 1980 Chevette. Going 45 MPH on I-95, just-a-cruising. This is life, this is luxury, this is Chevette-living.

       Sal's Corner "Time to Check My Crackhouse" Vol. 2    The last time we talked, I told you guys about the characteristics of "pipeheads". Now we move on to the usefulness of "pipeheads" and how resourceful they are   * Car Wash - You'll be hard-pressed to find a detail shop that will clean your car inside and out for $10. A car wash wont "hit your wheels" for $10. Air Freshener ALONE costs $10 in some car washes! Now onto the actual wash of the car. "Pipeheads" can do an immaculate job or ANY vehicle! They do this with a bucket of water, a bar of soap, a brush and a Frankie Beverly tape. NO vacuums, NO big sponges.........NO Problem. I've seen "pipeheads" brush up dirt SO fast that their arms move in a Blurr. LITERALLY. When letting "pipeheads" wash your car, there tends to be a risk. If you give them the $10 early they may get high and wash your car while they are high. OR, they may be "feenin" SO hard that they may do a rush job. This is where their Frankie Beverly tape comes in. The tape distracts them from the "crack" and makes them focus on that woman they loved before they fell in love with "crack". They begin to rub your car as if it were that woman and they were giving her a bath and a rub down.   * Entertainment - TV's, cameras, computers, DVD's. You name it, and a "pipehead" can get it! There are people with dining rooms fully furnished by "pipeheads". "Pipeheads" have NO shame. They will lug a TV in the middle of the street for the right price. The only setback is that unlike other salesmen, "pipeheads" dont know the features of their product. You might say "How many megapixels does that camera have?". More than likely, the response will be........"Dog I just got the camera and Im tryna sell it.......now what is you gonna do?"  If you are looking for customer service, go to BEST BUY.  * Fashion - "Pipeheads" go for the gusto. Neiman Marcus, Nordstroms, Lord & Taylor, Gucci, Prada or any store you need to go to, a "pipehead" can get you those clothes. You may have to take the "pipehead" TO the store and wait, but he will never let you down. You might walk down the street and a pipehead might stop you DEAD in your tracks and see if those Evisu Jeans he has can fit you. "Pipeheads" have cheaper deals than TJ Maxx when it comes to clothing.   * Delivery - You ever been in your "hood" and wanted a pizza but the store didn't deliver to your neighborhood late at night? You ever wanted McDonalds or Wendy's but you didn't feel like driving to get it? You ever needed milk from the corner store but didn't feel like walking down the street? "Pipeheads" save the day in these situations. Man oh man. "Pipeheads" are truly a blessing. They naturally walk fast so your food wont be cold.   * Auto Repair - Yes yes yes! "Pipeheads" HAVE to know how to fix cars. Either you wash them, or you fix them. It's a prerequisite. The only shortcoming is that whenever you take your car to a "pipehead", they ALWAYS tell you that its the Alternator, the Battery or the Carborator.   * Housing Products - Out of nowhere, you can get soap, dish detergent, clorox and starch off the street from a "pipehead". You might find yourself buying products like batteryoperated toothbrushes. You never thought of buying one before but a "pipehead" had one for $2 and all of a sudden, the health of your teeth became a concern.   "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"      "Nigga: The Word, The Meaning, The Way of Life"  by Salvador Gabor     Nigga Nigga Nigga Nigga Nigga. How many times can one nigga say nigga? Thats the question many people ask today. Its funny how the word nigga gets bleeped out on TV, yet you can say B*tch, A$$ and D@mn on television. People look at the word nigga as being derogatory??? Nigga derives from the word NIGGER. The actual meaning of NIGGER is dumb and/or ignorant person. Contrary to what we believe, the word NIGGER existed before slavery. Slavemasters used the word NIGGER to describe the slaves. This was a key factor in damaging the morale of slaves. Many researchers believe that the word NIGGER was used due to the fact that the African country Niger had a similar spelling. Regardless of what is said, when NIGGER is said, it is felt as a slur towards African-Americans. Most African-Americans will become very upset and will resort to violence when called a NIGGER. But today I didnt come to talk about the word NIGGER, im talking about the word NIGGA!   Many black leaders say that we shouldn't use the term Nigga. I beg to differ. See, nigga refers to the deep, inner-man within each male. White men can be niggas. Hispanic men can be niggas. Asian men can be niggas. Nigga in the way that we use it today refers to the male species ONLY. You never hear a person talking about a woman and say "That nigga is cute". They might say "That honey is cute" or "That broad is cute" or "That lady is cute". There maybe plenty of words to describe a woman but nigga is NOT one of them.   Let's go back to describing the nigga. A little bit of nigga is in ALL men. That nigga comes out at times, and for others, well.......them niggas just wear it on their sleeve. When you are at the urinals in a public place, that NIGGA inside of you wont let you pee directly next to the next man when there is another empty urinal. When someone jumps in front of a man in line, that man gives a look (not a mean look just THAT look), ....."oh excuse me, go ahead you were first". Thats that nigga in you.   Many people say that nigga and nigger denote ignorance. Not ignorance as in "I dont know" but ignorance as in "I Know and Im a act a fool any ole way". In other words just plain ole "Ignint". What's so wrong with that? We all need to get a lil "Ignint" every once in a while. "Ignince" doesnt have to be a loud display of foolishness. It can be done with one word. Let's say there is some trash on the floor. Someone asks if the trash is yours. You could reply "No, that's not my trash". Or you can reply "Naw SLIM, that's not my trash". A slight change in your response, JUST with one word change can alter the outcome. The guy who say "No" may continue to get questioned. The guy who said "Look SLIM that aint my trash" is left alone. Just a pinch of nigga was displayed to reconcile the problem.   Many environments REQUIRE bringing out the nigga in you. The barbershop, the DMV, the corner store, the car auction, PTA and parent/teacher meeting and so forth. Sometimes, you have to let people see you unveil that nigga inside of you.   Now some people have nigga in them and bring out that side in appropriate situations, and others are JUST NIGGAS. Im not in favor of NIGGAS being NIGGAS. These are the ones who wear it on their sleeve. We ALL dont need to hear you talking loud. We dont need to hear that your mother just hit "da number" for $7,500. We dont need to hear you cursing in public or playing your walkman at a volume that the whole train can hear it. We also dont need to see your boxers. Im sure JC Penney will hire more underwear models if needed. And WE DEFINITELY dont need you saying NIGGA all loud in some restaurant or department store. They JUST started to let "US" in those kinds of places a few years ago. And there you go running your mouth sounding like the COON that you are.   Its ok to show signs of the nigga that lies within thee. Just do it in moderation. And oh.........I asked a question earlier, "Just how times can one nigga say nigga?" ..........47 times to be exact. Thats ALOT of niggas.........(DING)........48!!!

       "Gotcha Hood On?" by Salvador Gabor     I was reading  urlLink Rome's  site and he talked about the "hood" and "blocks. He was wondering why guys in big cities are so attached to their "hood"? The following is my outlook on the situation    Experts say that in the beginning of time, this world that we live in was one big piece of land. All of the continents that we know now were attached. This is called the "Pangaea Theory" (Pronounced Pan-Gee-Ahh). As the story goes, time went on, natural events took place and the "Pangaea" separated into 7 continents. Within these seven continents, we now have countries, states, counties, cities, quadrants, districts, sections, neighborhoods and blocks. Sometimes, it makes you wonder........why are we so broken down now? Well, we are broken down now because it is impossible for us to all listen to one human being. Take the U.S. for example. The states weren't always united. People who didn't agree with the rules being enforced moved west and started their own states with their own rules. It's the nature of our society. We are "territorial" people. "I need my space". "Why is she in MY room?". "That's MY parking space!". The "hood" is no different.  We all know what the "hood" is. It's our "block". We live in a house in a neighborhood. Within every neighborhood there is a hangout spot. That is labeled the "block". Your designated "hood" might be 5 streets long but there is ONE "block" where yall hang. "Hoods" and "Blocks" are all many of today's youth know. Just as politicians battle for leadership in local, state and national offices, many of our kids battle for "hood" status or "block" status. We talk about these kids and go on and on about how bad it is that they think this way. In reality we ALL think that way.   Some corporate workers would have a FIT if they are moved out of an office into a cubicle for the sake of a new employee. Many homeowners would get their underwear in a bunch if their neighbors were lowering the value of the property. Some preachers would get mad if a church is built across the street from theirs and possibly took some of their members. Sometimes pretty girls get mad when the new pretty girl transfers to their school. There are so many elementary examples of this "territorial" mindstate that WE ALL have to some extent.  So what is it that makes these dudes "Hug the block"? What else do they have? When a dude from the "hood" goes to another community, he has NO say-so. He's just another guy passing through. And that's what he wants from other people when they come to HIS "hood". He just wants them to pass through. When more people have a say-so in his "hood", he loses the little bit of possession of an item that he has. Do you remember the theme song for "Cheers"? "You wanna go where everybody knows your name"? You want to be accepted. There is no election for the "hood". There is no probation period to become a member of your "hood". You're born into it and the sad thing is that no one wants to go beyond that. Many of our youth feel that if they go away, they will not be accepted in the new environment and more importantly...........they will be forgotten in the "hood". This sometimes can be true. The "hood" shall keep itself alive without you. Guys come home from jail and it's a new breed on the "block". You gotta start over. No one remembers your legendary status. No one remembers the Fila Sweatsuits or the Diadora shoes. When you move to another hood, no one remembers when you scored 6 touchdowns in the street that one day at the block party. All of that is forgotten. But does a neighborhood memory prevent you from going beyond a green sign with a street name on it?  A "Hood". What is it? A "hood" is a cover for your head when the weather is cold or inclimate. You put on your "hood" when it's raining, snowing or just too cold for your ears. But, you look foolish and/or "up to something" when it's nice outside and you have on a "hood". People can't truly see who you are if you have your "hood" on ALL THE TIME. The "hood" can be used for comfort when the elements outside are uncomfortable. When times get tough you rely on your "hood" to get you through. Being familiar with that "hood" develops that toughness needed in this society. But, at the same time, it's not always appropriate to keep your "hood" on. Meaning, when it's time for you to shine, take off your "hood". Even when you got your "hood" on, you never pull the drawstrings too tight. Keeping the "hood" real close impairs your vision and you hearing. Everybody wants to be so "Hood". Just loosen up on the "hood" a bit, so that you can see and hear things OUTSIDE of your "hood".       "Health and Fitness" by Salvador Gabor     Tyrone "Bo" Sanders   I know you guys have heard of Tae Bo. Well unfortunately, Billy Blanks did not invent the fitness exercise we know as Tae Bo. Tyrone "Bo" Sanders of Chattanooga, Tennessee invented "Ty Bo". After years of fighting in smoky cafe's and bars, Tyrone decided to tape all of the butt-kickin' he did and sold a few copies on BetaMax. Well, of course we all know that Beta went down the drain. VHS cam along and wiped that out and now DVD's are the main players in the video game.   "Ty Bo" missed all of that. In 1991, Tyrone caught a drunk-driving charge on Interstate 26. Knowing that he had outstanding child support charges, "Ty Bo" tried to run from the Po-Po. Well he didn't get far. They caught em and he tried to use some of his "Ty Bo" skills. They whipped that boy all night. That country karate he called himself doing got him into more trouble than it did help.   Well after 13 years of jail time, ole "Ty Bo" is back. And even though the police on I-26 whipped him almost to death when he used his "Ty Bo" skills, Tyrone needs about $32 for gas so he can get to work down at the plant next week. Make a long story short, he called me long distance and asked for a favor. He asked ME for the $32. I told em "I can't do nuttin for ya", but I decided to post this ad. Maybe one of you might want a copy of the tape from 1987 where he fought his grandma's boyfriend over a game of spades. He used some serious ghetto kickboxing tactics in that one. And it's going for $32.   For shipping call (423) 808-1905. Ask to speak to Tiny. If you can't reach them you can always call our hotline here at "The Project"........(301) 455-3534. Ask for whoever you want. Remember all proceeds from the tapes go to the Citgo Fund for "Ty-Bo".

      "An interview with Meshach Malone" by Salvador Gabor       I've always vowed to myself and those close to me that I would never ADD fame to someone already famous on this site. I wanted to search out people who don't get the credit they deserve. Meshach is a very good example of this idea. Meshach has been working in the mailroom at DuPont for 16 years. He has never had a raise. He has never had a vacation more than a 4 day weekend for MLK Day and Goshdarnit he's mad. Let's talk to Meshach   Salvador Gabor: Shack, how ya doing there?  Meshach Malone: Tired. VERY tired. I can't even half talk. All these envelopes got my tongue heavy  SG: You still lick the envelopes?  MM: How else they gonna get sent out!!!!!!!!!  SG: That's tough  MM: Then I lick all day at work and this heffa I got for a wife thinks Im a lick a home too!  SG: Well isn't she just the freak of the household??????  MM: I don't even want her getting close to me, let alone touching me. I just need some michelob  SG: So what makes you stay at DuPont day in and day out?  MM: The lil bit of change I make does me well.   SG: What's an average day at DuPont like Shack?  MM: Folding, licking and shipping. That's it. I come home and listen to this heffa run her mouth and I watch a Pistons Game  SG: Big Detroit Fan huh?  MM: I prefer the old Pistons. I gotta autographed Satin Jacket upstairs.  SG: Isaiah or Laimbeer signed it?  MM: OH NO. The real dudes.......Vinnie Johnson and James Edwards. James' daddy worked at DuPont. I tell ya.......ole Rufus could lick some envelopes!  SG: NBA Championship this year  MM: Them Wallace boys are something else! Man I like Corliss too. He got some nice haircuts. But ahhhh It's gonna be tough. L.A., Minnesota, the Spurs and Sackamenno are gonna be tough to beat  SG: Do you feel that the age of the "hard worker" is over?  MM: People dont come to work to work no more. I drink plenty of cranberry juice and eat pineapples in the morning just so my tongue can be ready for the day. They say it's the most powerful muscle in the body. You gotta be ready!  SG: What causes this laziness in today's worker?  MM: I couldn't tell ya? Niggas taking 2 hr breaks. I get a half hour. Thats it mayn! A half hour. 30 quick minutes and I'm back to licking and stamping. The real work gets done in the mailroom.  SG: If you could have 2 minutes with DuPont's CEO, what would you say?  MM: I don't need 2 minutes. Give me 2 seconds.........PAY ME  SG: Your favorite quote?  MM: You gotta lick it, before you stick it!

       "Sample Clearance"  By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.    You brothers need to get your samples cleared before you start using what somebody else did before. You are probably asking yourself "What in the world is Gartrelle talking about"?  Well I'm talking about the "Button-Up" craze/phenomenon that has invaded the closets of young brothers everywhere.   "I don't wear jerseys, I'm thirty plus/Get a crisp pair of jeans nigga button up." And with that line, Shawn Corey Carter once again dictated YOUR wardrobe.   Ya know, I'm glad that brother's have somewhat slowed down with the wearing of the "throwbacks" because at least it doesn't look like an NBA All-Star game is about to break-out on every corner. But now everybody looks like that BIG colorful lollipop you get at Kings Dominion.   You can't go out nowadays without seeing brothers in a butto...(Wait a minute, I refuse to call a basic SHIRT, a button-up anymore. It's just a shirt. AND like my colleague Reggie Dinkins, Jr. has said, it really is a button-DOWN. I start from the top and work my way down when I put on my 16 1/2 [that's the measurement of your neck-size for all of you who don't know how to buy a shirt that FITS.  XXL, XXXL are not sizes for real shirts.] But I digress)   I was recently out and about and out of say 30 dudes, about 21 had on striped SHIRTS. What happened to originality? Dudes can't think for themselves anymore? I mean I saw two guys together both wearing similar shirts.  What's worse is that one actually had on a blue Yankee fitted cap.  I said to myself, "What a tool."  Niggas will wear whatever ever you tell them to wear if you tell them the right way.  Niggas would start wearing trash bags if a rapper could make it rhyme. He could say something like: "I'm dressed so fresh all you niggas is mad/Button ups is for fags/I rock a Glad trash bag."  Next thing you know niggas would stop wearing "button ups" and would be buying designer trash bags at Shopper's Food Warehouse.   And the cufflinks. Niggas that don't even own suits are wearing cufflinks now. A shirt, some jeans, some tennis shoes, and cufflinks. Stop it! Cufflinks are to be worn with a French cuffed shirt, a suit, and some HARD bottom shoes.  Now I've always been one to go against the grain and ignore the brainwashing of the "the white man," so wearing clothes in an unconventional manner is cool with me.  But think about it gentlemen, when this "style" fades away, you will look back and realize how foolish you looked wearing cufflinks without a suit and tie.   What also upsets me is that I will not wear my shirts with jeans as often now because I don't want to look like every one else.  I have worn shirts for years, colorful striped ones, plain basic ones, etc. (I never wore cufflinks though unless I had on a suit.)  Since I'm not a follower, and I don't like to dress exactly like everyone else, I'm putting my shirts on the backburner for a while.  But I still do me, without looking like everybody else, because even though I took the time to write this, I really don't care what any of y'all wear. I'm just trying to enlighten some of you.  So fellas, stop sampling and start creating your own style, then maybe, just maybe, you can be as cool as me.    "You could not be like me even if you was my twin"--Andre Benjamin (Andre 3000)      This PSA was not brought to you by C.L.O.N.E.S. (Creating Leisure Outfits Now Everyone's the Same)     "True Courage" by Salvador Gabor   A few days ago a man named Pat Tillman died. Yes, people die everyday. At first sight, this seems like a regular death but, it's not. Pat Tillman was a football player for the Arizona Cardinals. Even though he wasn't extremely known, his presence will be missed. Now Tillman didn't die on a football field, he died in the act of war. He died while serving in Afghanistan. Tillman gave up his football career for a career in the military. He wanted to join his brother in active duty for the United States. Tillman was far from some bum who didn't have a shot at playing time. Pat Tillman turned down $3,600,000 from the Cardinals to go to serve his country. How many of us would do that?  I feel for the Tillman family. Most people would say "Awww they gonna be aight. They have money". But, it's obvious that money isn't the determining factor to the Tillman's. This is a man who gave up his possessions and fame for what he believed in. Now many of us are skeptical over the war but, that's beside the point. He chose a path and was not lead by his own wants. He felt that he had a mission to carry out. People lose focus and scan in on the fact that he died but, he is leaving a legacy. He makes the soldiers in Iraq know that no matter if the war is right or wrong, they have a reason to be proud. They chose this life and no matter what decisions come down from the Government, they are ready to follow suit.  Normally, I don't get THIS serious but, what are you willing to die for? Tillman took the saying "Stand for nothing and you'll fall for anything" to another level. he gave up $3.6 Million for the sake of serving the U.S.. Now, I dont care what any of you all say. If I had to give up a few "meeyons" to serve yall............cancel that.....quickly! I send out my condolences to the Tillman family and the other fallen soldiers and their respective families. We have men dying over debts, drugs, and "respect" in this country. These guys who die over insignificant things are dying for NO reason and a soldier gives up his life for another man to able to sleep with no fear. It's something to think about. But, what are you willing to die for?    "Word of the Day" by Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   quixotic  \kwik-SOT-ik\, adjective 1. Caught up in the romance of noble deeds andthe pursuit of unreachable goals; foolishly impractical especially in the pursuit of ideals.2. Capricious; impulsive; unpredictable.   "That Janet Jackson had that sun thing on ha' tit.......hmmmmm shoot.......that was way too  quixotic  for the Super Bowl."

       Sal's Corner "Black Hair" Vol. 1    Hair is a physical trait that we all cherish. Your feet might be "busted" but, you gotta get your hair right. You might not have much hair left, but the little hair you have, you keep it trimmed. Now as we look at the African-American culture, hair is taken to another level. Hair defines who you are. Hair is always a perfect fit for your individual personality. Hair can make or break you. It's all up to you and how you "fix" your hair. Let's look at some classic "Black" hairstyles........   * "The Fade" - There are many dimensions to "The Fade". The "Hightop". This was a style for most basketball players, fly dressers and background dancers in Rap Videos. You really couldn't be "uncool" and have a "Hightop". For those who couldn't pull off the "Hightop", the "regular" fade was cool. The fading line was at about eyebrow length and the hair height wasn't too high.  The "Low Fade" was at right around the ear length. It looked almost like a "Temple Taper" (which we will discuss later). Then we have the "high and tight". Now the real gangstas wore the "High and Tight". This is the fade that Roy Jones, Jr sports. You might see a west coast/midwest thug wearing one of those in 2004!  * "French Roll" - Ladies! This was sexy in 91. Every Jr. High prom or Battalion was French Rolled out! Nowadays, only women going on church bus trips wear the "French Roll". I think what took out the "French Roll" was when people started french rolling braids. That tight pullover started to give women that temple fade on the side. The braids were just pulling too hard.  * "The Rat Tail" - A lot of guys will claim they didnt have certain hairdos. But if you sit here and say that you didnt have a RAT TAIL, you is a liar and a thief!!!! If you were born before 1980, you had a rat tail. Cause in '88 you were at least 8 years old. You had to have that rat tail! My question is.......WHO STARTED THIS NONSENSE? Who said they were gonna let a piece in the back grow? Remember when you were little...........you'd tell the barber "Leave the back alone Im growing a tail". Your barber gives you the "Nigga Please!" look.   * Sideburns - I dont know what it was about these but sideburns were strange to me. Girls used to actually GEL their sideburns. Back in like '85 it was so many girls walking around looking like Kool & the Gang back-up singers. It got out of control when women who had thinning hair started to have more sideburn hair than hair on their scalp.  * "Asymmetric" - This was that "do" that ladies had where the one side was long and the other side was long. See........SO many females TRIED this one. But ladies, you gotta WORK to keep this one up. You cant just get up and go to work with the "Asymmetric". You might gotta roll up the short side and "wrap" the long side. You're up early in the morning.........curling one side and flat-ironing the other side. It's a lot of work ladies.    Stay Tuned until next week when we will go over "do's" such as the "Shag", "Bangs" "Jheri Curls", "Blonde tops and dark sides" and other all-time greats.       "You got it up"  Pt. 1 by EEzy Duz it   I was asked to enlighten the people on something that is endangering our society.  These things are "GUNS".  We need to put the "guns" down.  I know you think this is some "Cease Fire" speech but, it is not.  Everybody has a "gun".  The simplest form of a "gun" is a lie. When you are lying, “you got it up”. The "It" being your "gun". It gets a lot more complex so you need to put on your seat belt and enjoy the ride.  (This is not written to offend anyone in anyway, so if you are offended take it as constructive criticism)   "You got it up" when you go outside of your character to be like someone else. If you are lost, I will tell you exactly what I mean.  As we all know, television and music videos in particular set the majority of the trends in our society. From fashion to cars to slang etc. etc. Everyone has seen something on TV and said "That’s nice I think I will try that".  But, some of you go to the extreme. "You Got It Up!!"  It’s to the point that all the good rappers are playing "Simon Says" with the world.  They say or wear something and everyone in the whole world will run and do it.  Last spring and summer, it was the "throwbacks".  Everybody had to have a "throwback". Now it is pinstripe button ups, polo’s and blazers.  This doesn’t go out to everyone because some people have been dressing like this forever. The appropriate people know who I am talking to.  Even if you like the style, try to make it your own. Don’t do exactly what you see in a video.  "You got it up" for real!  A couple of people that I know, I couldn’t have paid them to slightly dress up a while ago.  Now they're talking bout, “I am giving all my jerseys away an I'm wearing all button ups.”  I wonder why??  Go out in publice. Almost every single dude had on a pinstripe button up or a blazer.  You see them in the club or in a restaurant with cigars and shades.  Shades in a club?!?!?! "You got it up". Be original in everything that you do. Even when you copy try to make it your own.   Secondly, let's talk about these fake "spinners" yall are buying for yall cars.  Aw man!!! Please put your "gun" down because "you got it up" way too high for me!  Now keep in mind that a real set of "spinners" is going to run you at least $10,000. Why do you think that you would impress anyone if your rims cost more than your car?  You moving too fast. Pump your brakes and leave them Wal Mart hubcaps where they at.  I might pull up to you at the light in your truck......you got one rim in slow motion, one spinning backwards, one rocking back and forth and the last one not even moving.  That speaks for itself.  I will leave you with a small note on "having it up".  Big diamonds are expensive. Louis Vuitton is expensive. Gucci is expensive.  If someone you know comes up to you talking about they got a deal $100 or less on any of these,  please do not buy it .  "They got it up" and "you got it up" if you think about copping. Until the next time, Try not to "have it up" so much.

      "Training Camp" by Salvador Gabor   It's early in the month of May. The "season" is about to start. What "season" it is you might ask? It's the "kid's season". Now that school is almost done, kids won't be as supervised as in the winter. Parents are at work and kids are left alone. We all need some "training camp" before the "season" starts.  There is a scripture in the Bible that says "Train up a child in the way that they should go, and when they get old they will not depart from it". It's funny that the word "train" is used and not the word "coach". It would be a totally different sentence if it were "Coach up a child in the when they should go, and when they get old they will not depart from it". Many parents think that they are "training" their kids and they're only "coaching" their kids.  As I walk outside throughout my daily life I see many kids falling astray. Children having children, children at young ages already addicted to substances, and children who have no direction in life. Most parents throw their kids to the wolves with no real experience. Parents let kids get away with murder as long as the child doesn't disturb their lives. Kids can curse, smoke, and have sex in the houses of their parents freely and with no remorse. Parents sometimes participate IN the activities WITH the kids. I'm almost 25 years old and I would STILL be scared to even let my mother smell smoke on me. It's just a common respect that you have for authority and your parents in particular that is missing today.  Well what about the two words "coach" and "train"? Let's talk about "coaching". "Coaching" is giving instructions WHILE the "game" is being played. This "game" of life that we play doesn't start until we are on our own as adults or as kids when we are out in public WITHOUT our parent. The "pre-season" and the "training" camp is when we are young AND in the presence of our parents. "Coaching" is when we get an "F" on our report card and we come home with the grades and mom screams at us. "Coaching" is when we get caught stealing and dad has to pick us up from the precinct at 2:00 A.M. and he's heated! "Coaching" is when your 12-year old son says he's gotten a girl pregnant and now both sets of parents are irate. The "coaching" is much harder when you haven't "trained" your "players". The "players" are the kids. As a parent, YOU are the "coach". A child's school performance is "game time". A child that makes a decision to shoplift is doing so when it's "game time". Kids makes choices to have sex when it's "game time". Whenever children make decisions on their own, it's "game time" and that's not the place that parents want to begin "coaching". There is a process beforehand that has to take place.  "Training" comes before "coaching". "Coaching" is yelling at the players and signaling what plays or what decisions to make from the sideline during the "game". "Training" is the actual physical combat that prepares the player for the "game time". Whether it be lifting weights, running, practicing or physical therapy, "training" is the overall preparation tool for the "game" of life. I look at kids today and they don't know how to act in public. They yell out profanity on public transportation. Some don't have proper etiqutte. There are even those who don't practice good hygiene habits. You can't just yell at your kid about stinking..........."Boy get some deodorant under yo' arms, you stankin!". You have to "train" them. They can't just wake up in the summer and go! "Train" them to get up earlier to have time to lotion themselves, put on deodorant, brush their hair, brush their teeth and possibly add cologne/perfume depending on where they are headed. This is just one of many examples of "training". "Training" is also running through the "plays" that may be used in a "game". As "coaches", parents have to go through the "playbook". If you have a daughter, in order to prevent her from dating some hoodlum, inquire as to what she wants in a man. Many parents don't do that. This dialogue will give you a chance to express what you want to see from her companion. This is the same for your sons. Many of us as kids made the wrong choices because our parents made vague comments. "I want you to go to school and be good". That leaves alot of space for curiousity and trouble. Parents have to get into the heads of their kids and be one step ahead of the mistakes they may make. You can't prevent EVERYTHING but, some issues can be prevented with a simple conversation that involves going over simple steps to proper decision-making. "Training" may mean taking your child with you at an early age so that they can see YOU and how YOU act in "game time" situations. Seeing you go to the bank and taking care of financial issues or going with you out to eat at a fancy restaurant may lead to a child understanding what it is to conduct themselves in a proper fashion. The "coaching" that our parents do is often too late. Why yell after the fact? "Training" comes in handy!  Their isn't much "coaching" to do when you have a good team on the floor. A team that has "trained" well will win the big "games". If you don't practice, "game time" situations will be when the practice takes place. In this life that we live, we don't have much time to practice when the pressure is thick. Many of our "coaches" are quick to yell at the "players" DURING the "game". Remember "Practice makes perfect" and "The game is often won BEFORE the game even starts".

       "Liquor Store Etiquette" 5.6.04 by Reggie Dinkins Jr.     "Niggas and society's strategy forge the chains along with the coordination of the matching jumpsuits"   Much of society's dysfunction is a result of the plan of so-called leaders, and these cultural weeders.  Many people fail to realize that no matter what flavor Kool-Aid a nigga drinks, it's best when made with hot water.   Enjoy your inner peace. Without it, the letdowns will drop you off somewhere in Down & Out Terrace.   Why try to get even with your enemies, why have enemies, if it is deeper than Cowboys vs. Redskins, quite frankly someobody might get killed.  Live your life and never burn your Hot Wheels.   Many people in today's society are ungrateful, and it is with gratitude that I except these ingrates.   Trouble don't last always, well it shouldn't, a dog can't jump but so many fences.   Imitation can only get you so far, you serve me an imitation steak, and you gonna get a legitimate side of cuss-cuss.   You can't please everybody all the time, so don't break your back trying to.  Shoot..........everyone don't laugh at monkeys all the time.  Happiness often disguises himself as Gay, so watch your proverbial buttock.

       "Get a Grip" by Salvador Gabor    "You really need to get a grip". Has someone ever told you that? I think in some fashion, we have all had that said to us at one time or another. "Getting a grip" means to regain control of yourself or to relax a little bit. So many people live their lives up tight.........or at least we THINK they live their lives up tight. See, when you "get a grip" on life, you are living up tight. it's the people that complain and whine that are living too loose.   Whenever you are in a rocky and rough situation you have to hold on. That requires one to "get a grip". If you are on a roller coaster, you gotta "get a grip". If someone is driving too fast, you gotta "get a grip". You would never loosen up if the road gets bumpy. That's destine to make your hit you head against the window. If you were to loosen up, you would lose control.  Most of these people who you think are up tight are actually too loose. Every bump in the rough road that they travel along has them bouncing around. Just "get a grip". Not having a "grip" means that you have nothing to hold onto when times get rough. In today's society, many of us have no foundation. All we know are the books that we study or the jobs that we work on. People don't have personalities. It takes some people hours to get simple jokes. Some people are too serious. Just too LOOSE. Tighten up your "grip" and come back to this world.      I wanna take it back to an old Sal's Corner. This is an old one from  urlLink Rome's   site that I did back in December just in case yall missed it, here it is.......    12/8/2003 Sal's Corner "Names"   Names. We all have them. A name is a sound that comes out of our mouths that identifies a particular person. A name is much more than a sound though. Sometimes it predetermines out destiny. If you name your son a name that is feminine, he might turn out to be gay . A ghetto name MIGHT just turn out a ghetto adult. Names can be a blessing, curse or a flat out mistake. One thing about names is that people who bare the same names usually act the same. Let's take a look, if you agree ok, if not hey its ok too (I Know more than ONE of each of these people so dont think I'm singling you out if this is your name and you know me):   1) James. James is that guy who's mother yells his name out loud from the second floor of the house. He's usually the first to get grey hair, the first to get a beer belly and the last to move out of mamma's house. Sometimes, James' seem to be married to their mother. Aint too many James jr's and James sr's coexisting. Thats too much James Power!   2) David. David is the laid back guy who really aint into people that he dont know. You can always count on a David to be exactly where you thought they were gonna be and thats the same place they were 10 years ago, out on the porch, hands on the rail waiting for that nice young tender to come home from work that lives next door. Women love David's.   3) Chris. Chris is wild. No matter how you cut the mustard. He's a wild guy. He's gotta lil bit of the pure devil in him. You hang with a Chris long enough and you'll be at the precinct. Either picking Chris up or in there WITH Chris.   4) Leon. Leon is a guy you HAVE to deal with. He always has the hook-up on something. Its times when you cant beat having a Leon on your team. Tip: Always take a deep breath before dealing with a Leon.  5) Mark. Mark is a hustler. Street kinda guy. Cool but can be gully too. Mark's rely on their suave nature to get outta situations.   6) Marcus. Marcus is an offspring of Mark. He has hustler characteristics but he is a little more wild. Every Marcus has a nickname. I know like 5 or 6 and they all have Aliases   7) Charles. He's the dude that you grew up with, he gets shot and possibly dies at an early age. If you met him after the age of 12, you dont know that his name is Charles. You'll get to the funeral and the obituary will shock you. "THIS Nigga name was CHARLES....I always wondered what C-Rock stood for????"   8) Paul. A man's man. Laid back, avid sports watcher, sticks to his business. He's similar to Charles, in a sense that you might not know his real name. Paul's tend to deal with larger shaped women. Paul's have great relationships with their women for that reason. They love the inside of a woman in more than one way (if you get my drift)   9) Mike. The consumate cool guy. You think everyone loves Raymond........you havent met Mike. Michael, Mikey, Mike........its all the same. He's the class clown, class freak, class ladies man the all-american. In the 80's there were guys calling themselves Mike whose name wasnt even michael. There name might have been Jeremiah......"Hey man call me MIKE!"   10) Tony. Anthony, Antonio, Antoine.......real similar to Mike. Everyone wants to be a Tony. Your name is Ezekial, you can be a Tony. Your name is Eugene, "hey call me Tony". Another of the top 5 names of the 80's. Tony and Mike are usually good friends. Either that or they really respect each other. Tony sells drugs with Mark or they beef over territory. Tony gets shot and his life is lost before its prime. He doesnt live big very long but in the eyes of everyone, he's always Tony.   Bonus : Ray. I gave you 10 but this one is for free. Keep your eyes on all Ray's. Key word: Supervision. A Ray is just what the name means.........a streak of light. Ray shines bright and will hit you in the blink of an eye. Ray's are all over the place. Ray's are fun-loving, yet that fun can cost you sometimes.   Thats all my time for this week. Yall keep it light out there mayne! "This is my corner and Im glad to share it with yall". Until Next Week Playa..........."Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

       "Indestructable Niggas #2" by Reggie Dinkins Jr.   In last time's volume, we met a laid back nigga named "Cras", and we delved into his indestructable nature.  Oh but today......we take a look at a much more dominant and more physical nigga in nature......... "Inevitable".   Nobody really knows where this nigga came from, it was kind of inevitable that he showed up.  Ole Mr. Forseeable, told us a predictable and unavoidable nigga would show up one day, and it was "Inevitable" that we would see.   A serious type nigga, never really wanting to say "I told you so", but it was "Inevitable" that said kicking rocks might break your toe.  Always one to show kids and adults alike, a hungry wino might take your unchained bike.  He is not necessarily the bearer of bad news, but he is related to "Reality", "Inevitable" is the one who told these young girls don't talk to Duracel employees, because you will wind up with spousal batteries.   He is the type of nigga who has accomplished many things from saving broken homes, to the celebration of Hooters 25-cent wings.  Lets take a look at some of his works over the years.  25-cent wings and plenty of beer, it was "Inevitable" that said Hooters should have a great fiscal year.  When momma said be home by the flicker of the streetlight, and you let Tyrone take a ride on your bike, now you're home bikeless and it is well after nine, it was "Inevitable" who said you gonna have welps on your behind.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, it was "Inevitable" who said the circle will remain unbroken, and these silly girls will chase distributors of crack unsmoken.  Crack dealers selling crack to crackheads, related to hussies making crack dealers feel like crackheads.   One thing that should be understood about "Inevitable" is that he is man who shows up anywhere.  He might show up in Vickie's Secret when you're buying them underwear........ "you know they too small so put them down, unless you wanna bake a muffin in your dark compound."  A businessman he is, with many stocks and bonds, he doesn't pressure his broker about mutual funds....... "if the feeling's mutual you will sell when I tell you, but don't offer me no last second sneaky info and find your self locked up with a disease like a caged dog with fleas.  I think it's called M-S (Martha Stewart)." "Inevitable" is one of the few niggas who can bust up in Congress, walk to the front and get right on the mic and speak of education and the gas price hike........... "Iraq is gonna teach you, he got a trick for you, dont worry about that oil but, about these rough-housers in school. You more worried about the children of oil in Istanbul, than these children of oil playing in pissy pools, freebasing on basement barstools, and learning math by using animals.  Animal math will lead to blood baths"  That wasn't a misquote that was "Inevitable".   "Inevitable" and his Circle 7 Theory, "Crack is circular, everybody chasing it, from the smokers to snorters, and those looking for sexual displacement, turning geniuses to fiends, pretty girls to sirens, and so-called bidnessmen to registered non-voters.  The circle that surrounds crack may be big and soft, but all in all, no matter how big the circle, how nice the area, don't nothing good come out of crack but crap."      "Music News" By Salvador Gabor     "Tite 2 Def"  (From Left to Right.......Orlando-Miguel Jackson, Ricky Baker and Stanley Collins)  Dont forget to check out the new album "1989 Forever" from the group "Tite 2 Def".This group is attempting make a strong comeback. Rumors of frontman Stanley Collins' true sexuality haunted the group since it's last release, "Soft, Wet & Tite" in 1991. Collins denies the rumors of an "alterior" lifestyle. Orlando-Miguel was just released from jail on tax evasion and needs the money badly. Ricky Baker is just plain upset because he JUST missed out on the "Trucker Hat" Fad.   "1989 Forever" The Album is on sale at all "Wings & Things" and other Chinese Carryouts in the area. This album was rated a 1 out of 10 Stars but it does have the hit "Wait a Minute Now".

      Sal's Corner "Black Hair" Vol. 2  Right back where we started from. If you havent read Vol. 1, you need to catch up. For those who havent, we just talked about how "Black Hair" has evolved and where we came from as a people when it comes to Hair Fashion. Needless to say, Madame CJ Walker would be proud!   * "The Shag" - See what people DON'T know is that this "do" is still sported. You may have to go down south to find one but don't be surprised........they always said "Be careful of how you look for something, cause you might just find what you were looking for!" A Shag is that mini-bumper on your neck. Men don't cut the hair from the neck area of their head and let it grow until a mini-bush has appeared on the back of their head. It takes the shape and form of a bumper or a space bar from a computer. "Shags" add a sleek look to any man wanting to be cool. Most people with "shags" wore their top button opened up and keep their hands in their pockets for a cool look. For some reason, a person with "shag" always has to look from left to right in real quick motion. I dont know, yall figure it out. The "Shag" is a bit different from the "rat tail". The "Rat Tail" was an up north thing, but that "Shag".............that was North Carolina and on down the road.   * "The Gumby" - As I write this article I think about how EASY barbers and beauticians have it now! Now, every guy gets an "even" and every woman gets something fairly manageable. The "Gumby" solidified your barber's expertise. I think this personified the difference between barbering and just "cutting niggas heads for $10". You had to be a master barber to cut a dude's head on a direct slant. That's still amazing to me!   * "Bangs" - Oh yes........."oooh SHE BANGS...SHE BANGS....oooh SHE BANGS". I think "Bangs" were very sexy when I was in the 5th grade. If you were ugly, had pimples or had a big forehead, "Bangs" did the job. A pony tail and "bangs" did it for me back in the day. I loved the girls with those.  * "Blonde Top and Dark Sides" - This is kinda when the whole hair coloring thing went crazy. I have a confession to make..........I LOVE women with the blonde/orange hair coloring. Even the light streaking in the hair is something that I love. So when this style came out, it added another flavor to it. This "do" is a short "do". It's a female version of the fade. Yet the top is curled and colored blonde or orange.....maybe red/burgundy if ya nasty. But, the sides are the natural color. The neck may have a thunderbolt cut into it. That's just to Jazz it on up a lil bit. This "do" can STILL be seen. You might find a nice 40-plus, good looking, Bus Driving woman wearing one of these. Bus Drivers, Parking attendants or maybe a lady who has a job counting money.   * "Perm" - Oh no, now I know ladies get perms. But im talking about the fellas who have perms. See you may laugh but, a nigga with a perm is the most serious nigga you are gonna run across. Like.........how can you joke with or at a nigga wit a perm?  A dude wit a perm aint about no jokes. It's always business. If you see a man with a perm in 2004 and dare to laugh at him he might just back-handedly slap the living "you know what" out of you. He wont SAY a word. Just slap you and keep it primpin and pimpin. Oh but some ladies have this style too. They might go up to NY or Philly on a bus trip from Gastonia, NC. They might get off the bus in the shopping district and get out with their rollers off but dont comb the curls out.   * "Jheri Curl" - (I can hear the Monday Night Football Theme Music in my head) Now this is the one we've ALL been waiting for. Truly, no truly...........all jokes being put aside...........the "Jheri Cul" changed the game as we know it. The "Jheri Curl" (also known as "Jerlie Curl"), was the biggest fad in Black Hair EVER!! It had spin-offs too. The "S" Curl, the "J" Curl and many more took after it's father-figure. Nevertheless, "Jheri" will ALWAYS stand shoulders above the rest. I wanna take my time on this one so let's lay back. See, this one is a prime example of how our people have longed and chased after other cultures. Many of us lied in elementary school. "I got Indian in my family". No No No. Those are the after-effects or curl mania. Or should we say......."Post Pardum Curl Depression" Now...........for EVERY "DO" that we have discussed, someone will admit to have wore it at one time or another. But a "Jheri Curl" wearer will only be known IF you knew that Curl wearer AT the very time that they wore the curl. Girls kill me. They be all cute in the street NOW. I be wantin' to buss them out.........."Dont even act like that, I remember when you was Juicin up back in '87". A person will get embarrassed NOW if you tell the world that they had a curl. Seriously though, this "do" was the demise of a strong black nation. So many black people made themselves look like coons. And to think, people STILL WEAR these curls. People, if you have an aunt or grandmother or (God Forbid) a male figure in your life with a curl, take them by the arm and go get that curl cut off.    "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"     "Graduation Announcements" by Salvador Gabor      Langston Glover  Lannie on this day, we celebrate your graduation. May your heart be filled with joy as you celebrate. We hope and pray that the Lord may bless you with the job that you longed for. All praises be unto him, our father. Be blessed baby!   From, the Covington's       Lynell "Man-Man" Simpkins  Baby boy, we know it took you 6 years to graduate from Mailmen school but we aint a drop less proud son. We love you so much. You will forever be in our hearts. May your routes be filled with joy as you pass out that mail. Today is truly a day for celebration.

       "Knockout King"  By Salvador Gabor     Me and my homie were talking about real dudes that we knew in the streets. I respect ALOT of dudes for how they keep it real. If a problem comes along, they handle it. Whether it be through talking or fighting. I don't condone fighting but, these dudes had skills when it came to the hands. One dude in particular stood out to us. "Big Hugh" is his name. "Big Hugh" has been a rough nigga for years. He was running the streets when my daddy and em was young. Shoot......I've heard that he was out here knocking niggas out WAY before that!   "Big Hugh" is tough. I mean the toughest of the tough. Most niggas can't fade "Big Hugh". "Big Hugh" done made plenty of dudes run in the house. I've seen "Big Hugh" make niggas cry. I mean, ole "Hugh" is a gangsta! The reason why I'm talking about "Big Hugh" is because yall need to be scared of him. Be aware of "Big Hugh" and if you see him coming, you better run. Don't worry, I'm gonna let you know how to recognize "Big Hugh" when you see em. "Big Hugh" is very aggressive. Sometimes before you can walk out of your door, he's right in your face. Sometimes you can be at work and getting ready to leave and "Hugh" is at the door. He's pointing his finger and saying "Come on out lil nigga!". You can't stay at work! Your kids have homework to get checked. Your husband needs his dinner. Your wife needs her car to be taken to the shop. You can't tell your family that "Big Hugh" had you scared to leave work, now can you? "Big Hugh" is not an inside type of dude. He hates Air Conditioning. He usually stands outside between 11 A.M. and 8 or 9 P.M.. He aint a late night type of dude but, in July he hangs out a lil bit. He walks the streets and waits for people to come outside and he'll try to fight em. See, whenever you step outside, you are in a fight with "Big Hugh". This is whether you like it, know it, love it or not. Don't think "Hugh" is no sucka! You play with "Big Hugh" if you want. He'll knock you out. Sometimes what seems to be a slight tussle can turn into a "take your shirt off" kinda fight.   "Big Hugh" is a petty nigga. I done seen "Big Hugh" knock people's grandmothers out. One day I had to say something to that nigga. I took a deep breath and I just went on and told em about himself. I said "Looka here Hugh, you aint had to hit Mrs. Wilkins like that!". You know what the nigga "Hugh" told me........he said "Tell Ole Wilkins to sit in that window like she's supposed to!". I had to agree with em though. See, "Big Hugh" runs the streets in the summer. Then, he goes to Miami and Cancun and places like that for the winter and his homie "Hawk" comes out during the winter. Since he only has about 3 or 4 months to run the streets, Mrs. Wilkins should have known better than to come outside. Man "Hugh" knocks lil kids out and everything. "Big Hugh" done killed people. He catches alot of bodies in the summer. He's a cold killa! You gotta respect "Big Hugh".   Now I know what you are thinking. I do. I really really do. You're saying to yourself........."Have I seen Hugh?".  YES you have . You're also probably thinking........."Have I fought Big Hugh?".  Yes you have . And you're probably thinking........."How does he look then?". Well, I can't tell you all of that. I can tell you his real name though. His mother named him  "Humidity"  but, I just call him "Big Hugh". I got to know him real well when I was young. That's why me and him are on a "Nickname" basis. We met when I was about 7 back when I used to play freeze tag in the street all day long. He knocked me out that summer. A couple of times for that matter. But, once I got in the house and got some air conditioning, we always squashed our lil beefs. It was my fault, my mother used to tell me to stay in the house any ole way! I kept messing wit ole "Hugh" anyhow. Then after a while, I tried to duck him. I did that for a few summers but, we met up again when I had that summer job working outside. We talked alot that summer. Well  "Humidity"  is his first name but, I never found out his last name. I thought it was Jenkins. He used to always go to their family reunions. Then he showed up at the Robinson Family Reunion. He peeked in at the Brown Family Reunion. I caught him knockin' a nigga out at the Wilson Family Reunion. He even came to a few of mines. He wasn't invited to any of em so, I don't know whose boy he is???? Whoever his mamma is, she need to whip em cause he been knockin too many people out.   All I can say is stay clear of ole  "Humidity" . During his time out here in the summer, don't eat too much beef and pork. That makes you slowful and he'll uppercut you real quick if you eating that stuff too much. He'll give you a right hook if you're sitting outside off of a few cups of Remy. You may just have to decline on that last "run-it back" game of 5 on 5 sometimes. That last game might make "Hugh" come out there and close your eye wide-shut! Just don't play with "Hugh". He'll have you somewhere in the back room with "Big Mamma" with a wet rag on your head and sitting there watching "Judge Joe Brown" with her.

      "Pack Your Vest" By Salvador Gabor     Just wanted to let yall know........."Ricky Reynolds: The Playa's Boutique" has a 75%-off sale on Suit Vests. I know that all the "Macks", "Pimps", "Boss Playas" and "Dons" are gonna wanna look tight to death when they hit the scene this summer. It may be a lil too hot for the suit jacket, so why not just go on and flex the vest!!!!! Yall need to hop on this here game and get it while it lasts. A wise man by the name of "Ken" once told me........."DONT DOWN EM........CROWN EM!"    "A League of it's Own" By Salvador Gabor   Could you imagine being at your place of work. While working, you may get frustrated. You may question the decision of an authority. Your defense may be just. But, yet you get told to leave the office for the rest of the day. Then, when people ask you what happened and you make a comment about your boss or authoritative figure, you get docked pay just for expressing your opinion. This is the life of many professional athletes in our world today.  With the 2004 Olympics just months away, the NBA officials and U.S. Olympic Committee are "scrambling" to get 12 strong U.S. players to compete in the Basketball Competition. With the foreign invasion that has occured in the last 3-5 years in the NBA, many of our best stars aren't from this country and have made the decision to represent their respective countries in the 2004 Games. So, with that being said, you can eliminate many players from the pool of "top-notch" talent that the NBA has to offer.   But, the U.S. born players that we automatically look to, find themselves in a bind on whether or not to participate in the 2004 Games. Preparation for and actual competition in the Games would occupy the majority of the players' off-season. Because of this, some of our U.S. superstars have declined to play. Others can not play because of legal issues, ceremonies such as weddings, and the opportunity to spend time with family. There are even some who are expecting "new" family members in the form of child birth. Then, there are those who have been to the Games a few times already and don't have the same "flame". Also, there were bombings in Greece recently (The Site of the 2004 Olympic Games) and some players fear for security. There are so many variables that play a major part in players deciding not to participate this summer.  The last time that the U.S. competed on an international level, we got demolished compared to the standards that we are used to. In the 2002 FIBA World Championship, we came in SIXTH PLACE! Yugoslavia, Argentina, Germany, New Zealand, and Spain all placed higher than we did. We went from "smashing" teams by 60 in past years, to losing by 5-10 points in each of the final rounds of the 2002 championships. Now, with all of this in mind, we want to bring a "top-notch" team to rebound from the embarrassment.   Well if the NBA treated players like humans and not slaves, many "top-notch" players would participate without any doubt. The same players that the media and NBA blast for making comments about coaches, front offices, and talking back to referees that don't always make proper calls are the same players we now NEED to show off the United States' talent. We pay these guys alot of money but, they can't say a word about how they feel. Now, it's a coincidence that many of these players have other obligations and won't be able to be apart of the Games. In my opinion, many of these players would put those obligations to the side momentarily to do this for their country. But, the way the NBA is set-up now, if you are not "hot" the league will forget about you. So why remember the league, when the league needs you?

       "In The News" By Salvador Gabor     * Two middle aged men were arrested for stealing 3 pairs of "Corniche" Jeans from a Dillard's Department Store in Asheville, NC. The two men, Rodney Wilkins and Bruce "Two-Time" Wiggins were nabbed at a local Kroger Grocery Store with the jeans on. Asheville County Police Officers escorted the men to the Asheville County Jail but, they were released. Sources say that the Police Department felt that if these two men had the nerve to still be wearing "Corniche's" then, they should be left alone.  * Oglewood Elementary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has decided to have a Prom for it's Kindergarten graduates. This will be the first Prom held for a Kindergarten class in the history of American Elementary Schools. Thomas Wooden, Principal of the school noted that his decision for holding a Prom for the kids came from his observation of an increase of kids "humping" in the closet. He feels that if this is going on, they need some sort of outlet to release this tension. Maybe some off-beat dance moves such as the "butterfly" and the "tootsie roll" that little kids do will change the situation for the better.        "The Click" By Salvador Gabor    Society leads us to believe that if we are not in the correct groups, we will not succeed. In many ways, this is true but, it is not the only way to become a better person. Many of us rely on "clickin" up with people to get by in this world. With the internet and other technological advancements, we are only a "click" away from anything that we want. Now I know that the word "click" is spelled "clique" when referring to groups but, let's just keep it simple for now. With a "click" of a button or a "click" of a crew, we believe that anything can happen.  This idea starts in grade school. Teachers angle their lesson plans around putting the class in groups to convey their points. For the first half of the class, the teacher will lay out the lesson. After that is finished, the class in broken down into groups for the activity that follows the lesson. At an early age, children begin to separate the winners from the losers. "oooooh I wanna be in the group wit Mike and Bobby". "Man....Kim is in OUR group!". "NO WE GOT KIM!". In most activity-oriented lessons, each student has a chance to answer questions to get points for their team. One reoccuring pattern is that kids who are deemed "smart" all want to get on the same team. Now as a member of the "smart" team, you may not have to answer ONE question. Your skills and knowledge will NOT be used nor is it needed on this superpower "smart" team. But, we wanna be with the winners. Nothing is wrong with that. It's necessary to get with the winners in life but, not at the expense of making your skills become dull.   This idea of "clickin" up continues onto Jr. High and High School levels. Between the ages of 12 and 18, kids feel a serious need to be wanted and accepted. All of the "fly" girls hang together. They hate each other most of the time but, they hang together just so that they can keep each other close and feed off that fashion energy, for whatever that is worth????? The "smart" people hang together. No one understands why they wear moccassins and pocket-protectors but, they have a different mission than the average student. Then, the "ruff" dudes all at least respect each other if they don't hang together. You might see two or three different "gangs", "hoods" or "crews" in the halls together smoking or running the halls just to prove to one another that they are "hard". Then you have the loners. No one knows them at first and when all of the other "clicks" are at a compacity, these loners come together. These are your future "columbine killers" and "American Taliban's" of this society. Anyway, no matter the circumstances, everyone finds somewhere to fit in.   You'd think that it stops at the High School level. Right? Naaaah. It goes on. For those who go to college or have been, you see that the "click" life gets worse. There are several "clicks" in college. You have the Frats and Sorors, Big Cities (D.C., N.Y., L.A., Philly, Atlanta) "clicks", Football and Basketball teams, "Fly Girls", "Earthy Girls", "Playas", and the "i'm just hear to get an education and I go home on the weekends click". There are SO many "clicks" in college. I could go on and on but, the picture has been drawn. In college, there are events on campus and off-campus where all of these "clicks" are in the same setting and many "clicks" use this time to show-off. The Big Cities "clicks" put on their fresh white tees and new shoes. Frats yell and dance all through the auditorium. The "Fly Girls" put on all of their designer wear just to go to the cafeteria. It can get really crazy.   THEN..........you come home from college. Once you come home or to whatever place you may be in at the time, you try to fit in on the social scene in that city. It just seems like you don't get all the daps and hugs at the local sporting events, lounges and restaurants like you used to in High School and College. No, everyone doesn't know your name. Nope, no one knows how you had 2 Prada bags in High School. No sir, they don't know that you dated the baddest female on campus. It takes alot more than association with a "click" to make it in this big city that you're in. You begin to look forward to the cookouts in the summer where you see all of the old High School crew. You find yourself traveling back to your old school every chance you get, just to rekindle that feeling you once had. The idea of being the big fish in the little sea. In a big city, the "clicks" are executives and directors who have floor seats at the basketball games. In a big city, the "clicks" are the people who make power moves and control the economy of the city. It becomes a whole different ball game for many of us. But, way back in kindergarten, we were taught to be apart of a group. That idea stayed with us and now we can't just rely on looks or who's cool to be apart of the "click". Somewhere along the way, we lost our talent and it became dull because, we wanted JUST to be in the "click". We've sacrificed sharpening ourselves as people JUST to be in the "click". It's just like a mouse on a computer. If you "click" it too many times, you might not end up on the page that you are supposed to be on.

If that is too difficult for the old folks you can contact Eunice "Muncie" Richards for more info at (301) 455-3534.  Continuing with the "education" theme..........  * This summer, The Salvador Gabor Project will host it's first annual "Avid Crab Eaters" Conference. Topics such as "How to avoid getting sauce on your hangnails", "When to bite the shell", "Why white shirts aren't the best for crab-eating?" and "How to properly greet people when your hands and chest smell like fish". Stay posted and tuned into The Salvador Gabor Project for more details in the near future      "To Owe or Own: The Road That Leads to Over" By Salvador Gabor   Relationships and friendships are valuable to a person's life. No one wants to be alone, no matter how much they deny it. It's cool to be alone for a while but at some point, we all need a person that we will interact with for the rest of our lives. Picking friends and a mate for life can be tricky. With friends, we sometimes can get caught up in just entertaining each other. Never going beyond a laugh or a good time. Never getting a chance to realize the other capabilities that a friend may have. In relationships, we never get beyond being "in love". That "in love" state doesn't last forever. And if you are depending on that to get you through, you may be mistaken.  I've always wondered why some people stay together as friends or lovers for years and years? Each day is filled with arguing, fighting, shouting and using negative language to "communicate" to each other. Is it worth it for them to be together? What is the true cause of the confusion? Many times it comes down to what you think you owe or what you think you own. A wife/husband is a partner or teammate in the "game" of life. If we've learned anything from sports in recent times, we've learned that it's never a good outcome when teammates criticize each other publicly. Also, the disagreements that are established in the locker room will and shall unveil themselves on the playing surface. A wife/husband should be a person that you desire to love. In any "game" or sport, what makes playing the "game" fun is when the people around you enjoy the "game" as much as you and that they play the "game" well with you. You also have to enjoy playing the "game" with them. When your purpose in a relationship/marriage is to love someone else and forget about what you get in return, then the "game" goes much smoother. But, many times we focus on "what have you done for me lately?".  To owe someone means that you have a debt with that person. That person has extended some service to you and you need to repay that person. If you borrowed $50 from someone, you are supposed to pay back $50. You never go beyond what you owe. Or I should say, you don't HAVE to go beyond what you owe. Even if interest is applied, all the interest does is to help equate the value of that $50 at this day and time. In relationships, if you feel that you owe someone something, you will only give until you feel your debt is paid. So therefore, husbands and wives live for years only giving because they feel that they owe their mate. If everything is equal, then both parties are hesitant to give. "Well HE needs to speak to me........I'm tired of having to speak to him first". "She don't even ask me if I'm hungry, I cook for her all the time". It's the small things in life that cause the biggest trouble in relationships. And it's all because we as people feel a need to keep a scorecard on what people do for us.  To own means that you have earned the right to make an outright decision on the possession that you have ownership of. You may not have always paid for what you own but, you are the caretaker of that possession and the last word goes through you. Just because you put a ring on someone's finger doesn't mean that you own them. Remember, you joined together in holy matrimony because you CHOSE to do so. You chose to love that someone. You chose to care for that someone. You chose to be there for that someone. And the day that those choices change, you are free to go. Oh yes, there are consequences for doing so. But, it's your decision. You  can't  make your mate do what you want them to do. You can only hope that love and the promise made in the committment leads them to respect your wishes.  In life, you owe on and own possessions. People are not possessions to be sold or to put a price tag on. We take for granted those who are the closest to us. We scream at our mates but, treat people in the street with the utmost respect. We are quick to acknowledge what we bring to the table but, never stop and thank God for the person who fills in the gap for our shortcomings. You can own or owe on a house or car. A house and a car can be destroyed and more than likely if you could, you would move on to a bigger house and a bigger car anyway. These material possessions are at the mercy of you and your desires. You use them to your fulfill your pleasures. Houses, cars and other possessions don't have feelings. THESE are the things that you own or owe on.

       Sal's Corner "Life: The Biggest Game on Earth"    People always say that life is a game. I hate to refer to it as such but, life really is a game. Not in the sense that it doesn't matter. But, in the sense that everyone wants to win in life. It takes teams to get through life. And of course, there are rules. Life is not like Baseball, Football, Basketball, or even duck duck goose. This is a different game. The rules of the game of life are almost a complete opposite of any other game or sport that we know. Let's take basketball for instance. Let's look at some things you CAN'T do in Basketball and how we HAVE to do these things in life to survive   * Double - In Basketball, when you dribble with both hands at the same time, it's called a "double" or a "double-dribble". But in life we MUST "double". You gotta "double" your wealth. You gotta "double" your power. You gotta "double" EVERYTHING. You never wanna be on the same level as your were last year. The older you get, it takes "double" to change your ways. As you get older it takes "double" the work to stay in shape. "Doubling" in a KEY part of the game of life.  * Traveling - In Basketball, taking more than 2 steps with the ball without dribbling is called "traveling". Well in life, you MUST "travel". Some of you niggas have never left Good Hope Road. GET OUT and explore! It will change your life! You get to see more. That "ball" is symbolic of a job or a restraint. We sometimes can not take more than two steps without dribbling that "ball". Just take 3 or 4 steps and "travel" sometimes.  * Goal-Tending - In Basketball, defending an attempted shot that is in the cylinder of the rim is called "Goal-Tending". Well in life, you have to Tend to your Goals. Tending to goals means defending your goal. Always know what it takes to get to where you wanna be. People try to put a "ball" in your goal. There's that "ball" again. Some restraint or some person telling you that you can't make it cause you have THIS or THAT to think about. If the ball looks close to going in, knock it out of your goal.  * Out of Bounds - In Basketball, when the ball touches the floor at a point where it is beyond the court or if you are touching the ball and one of your body parts is touching the part of the floor that is beyond the court, it is considered "Out of Bounds". But, in life, you must go beyond the boundaries. You never can stay in one place or one area.   * Foul Shots - In Basketball, free attempts at shooting the ball in the basket are awarded to a player who was fouled. Being fouled means that an opposing player was overly aggressive and physical which hampered the steady, fair and competitive game that was being played. Now keep in mind, I said OPPOSING player. Many people on your team may seem to foul you but they are helping you. A foul in life maybe constructive criticism or just hatred. It's a thin line. A thin, grey line. But, in this game of life, you don't get foul shots. You take comments, criticism, and hatred and keep going. No one is rewarded for being hurt. You just take that and keep going.  * Carrying - In Basketball, dribbling the ball and letting the ball go over your shoulder and bringing it back to the floor or having your hand holding the ball from the bottom of the ball is called "carrying". In life, you will have to "carry" something or someone. We all aren't natural leaders but, we all shall lead at least once in our lives. We work in teams and people on your team sometimes may be dead weight or people that can be put to good use but, they aren't motivated yet.   * Staying in the coaches box - In Basketball, a coach has a space that they have to stay in. Players on the bench can not come on the court unless they are substituting another player. Coaches can not come on the court at all. Now we talked about coaches a little while ago. But sometimes a coach HAS to come on the court and grab up a player! If you see something going wrong and you're viewing it from the sideline, sometimes you have to step ON the court and straighten it out.  * Self Pass - In Basketball, you can not pass the ball to yourself. Life is different. You have two hands. Sometimes, you have to free one hand and pass the ball to the other. Free yourself up for a day and do some other things to relax your mind. Sometimes you gotta throw the "ball" in the air. Not to someone else because it's your "ball" to use. But, just throw it in the air for a brief second to get a breather.  * 3 Seconds in the box - In Basketball, there is an area right under the goal called "The 3-Second Box". You can not stand in that box for more than 3-seconds. Well in life, you gotta stand in your place sometimes. Stand right near your goal until what's coming to you has arrived. Just keep on waiting!   You know why the rules in a game like basketball are so different than in the game of life? In life, there's no little old man in a striped shirt blowing a whistle. You are out here on your own. There is no referee. Although there are rules, you can do what you want to do. What you do wrong will catch up to you but, it may creep up. It wont be a whistle that will stop you. Control your destiny and try to travel, double, carry, and break every other basketball rule in life to get to where you oughta be.

       "The First Time I Said Yes....." By Salvador Gabor   The first time I said "Yes".........it's like I never said "NO". Doesn't always seem like that? Forget the first time I said "No". That's irrelevant right now. The first time I said "Yes"........what about that?? Is that an opened door to "flunky-hood"? I'm confused.  You can give someone a ride ONCE, and they think that one-day pass lasts forever. What part of the game is that? Where do they do that at? Since when does one act of kindness mean that it's "All 2 da good" when it comes to getting a favor from da ole boy? People tend to think that you are on their agenda. So if you really can't do the favor for them, they think you are "shady". One note for thought...........$3 or $4 of gas aint worth me taking you out to the boondocks. Unless you're giving me $20 for my time and efforts, I can't swing it playboy.   Ladies, sweeties, honeybuns, preciouses. Just because I told you that I would ride to the mall with you, doesn't mean I want to ride to the outlets too. Take me home. That's for real. Fellas, ladies always want you to go to the mall with them or somewhere that you don't feel like going. They want to see how far they can go and how much they can aggrevate you. I've said "No" before. This is NOT the first time.   Old people. Lemme tell you a thang or two. "Yes" I took you to drop your clothes off at the cleaners. "Yes" I sat with you and helped you put together your DVD player. And you still call my mother looking for me to help you change the channels. You are gonna make me say "NO" real soon.  I'm really a nice guy beneath all of the teasing that I do on this site. I don't wanna keep yall long. It's Friday and it's nice out. Just remember, "The first time I said YES, it's like I never said NO".       "The Playa's Summit Network" By Salvador Gabor   Playas across this mighty nation are aligning themselves together to display true playamenship by coordinating a nationwide tour. "The Playa's Summit Network" simply has ONE goal. "To show niggas how to do it in STYLE". That is the motto and model for 2004.

       "Loose Bowels" By Salvador Gabor    "Loose Bowels" can be a tough situation to deal with. "Loose Bowels" can be the most embarrassing thing to deal with in a public situation. You are all the way down at Kings Dominion, Six Flags, or Disney World and your stomach wants to show out! Why didn't it act like this when you were in the backyard packing the sodas and honey buns in the rental car??? Your stomach could have gave you the signal WAY before you got up in the amusement park. Now you gotta go sit on them nasty stools in the park. Furthermore, you gotta run from your friends and act like you don't have to use the stool. "I'll be right back." Then they say "Where are you going?". Then you YELL "LOOK I'LL BE RIGHT BACK". But, it's hard to leave the group because everyone travels in groups at the amusement park.  Now I know and you know that this "Loose Bowels" article goes deeper than taking a "dump" unexpectedly. "Loose Bowels" is a problem that many of us have. Sometimes our stomach is not the problem. Sometimes "Loose Bowels" isn't even about using the restroom at all. It's about the way we carry ourselves.  Before we go that far, let's look at "Loose Bowels". What are some of the symptoms and signs of "Loose Bowels"? Well, first off there is a sharp pain that comes to you. That pain usually comes from something that you have taken or eaten. You ate of something that you shouldn't have. And now, you are full of "mess". Once the pain comes, there is a sudden DROP. That DROP is the feeling that this "mess" is gonna come out NOW. The next step is to "Clinch". You gotta hold your butt tight so that the "mess" doesn't come out. Then you have to RUN as fast as ever to the nearest place to get rid of that "mess". But, once you get to where you can get rid of that "mess", it's the best feeling. You take a deep breath and all of a sudden you no longer care if anyone knows you had to take a "dump". The funny thing is that you will probably turn back around and get another bowl of chili and that "Loose Bowels" will be back after you sooner or later.  In this "Amusement Park" that we know as life, we sometimes take in the wrong stuff. It affects our body and mind. It tastes good but, it can have a bad outcome. That pain comes in. THEN there's that DROP. That DROP causes us to "clinch" and try to hold ourselves together and make everyone else think that we are alright, even though we are about to explode! We RUN to get rid of that "mess". We may run to a family member, a church, or a friend that we know that has some good advice to get rid of our "mess". These people are our "restrooms". As soon as we get rid of the "mess" in the "restroom", we take a deep breath. That breath relieves us and we go back to eating the "chili" that this world has to offer. But, if you're gonna eat all of that "chili", you betta stay close to the "restroom".

       Just My Thoughts  By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.    What's happening folks? Its been a while, but this legal profession is not a game.  I hope this finds you all in good spirits.  Now usually, I pick one topic and I share my views with you good people. Today, however, I'm going to give my take on a few topics of interest. I could go on and on, but I'll try to keep it brief for each topic.  Follow me if you will...   "No homo": The rampant usage of this phrase needs to stop.  Not now, but right now .  A real man does not need to qualify any statement that he makes by using this phrase.  A real man is confident in his sexuality and doesn't not feel the need to tell anyone that he's "no homo."  If you are a real man, it will speak for itself.   This "Down Low" Nonsense: To all my beautiful sistas out there, don't believe the hype!!! I know there are some men who are secretly gay, but there are many more real brothers out here that want you.  Don't give in to all the media attention being given to this so-called "phenomenon."  Remember who controls the media.  This is just another tactic to destroy the Black family and widen the gap between Black men and Black women. They want you to believe that we are either gay or in jail, or that all the good ones are married.  There plenty of good brothers out here, just open your eyes.   Fitted Caps: What's up with you guys wearing the sticker on the brim of your fitted caps?  Why do you want to inform us that you wear a "New Era" Size 7 5/8?  Is the sticker necessary? Are you planning on returning the hat? Is it covering a stain? A hole? Are you too lazy to peel it off?  Its a cap, not a mattress, you can tear it off.  This is really one of life's mysteries to me.   HBCU Graduations: I went to both Hampton and Howard's graduation ceremonies this year.  (I refuse to get into the HU v. HU debate anymore. I am a proud Hampton Alum but, big respect to Howard too, HBCU's unite)  Anyway, it's always good to see Black families together at this time of year. Congrats to all the graduates and their families for supporting them.   "Soul Plane": Black people, please don't go see this movie. I beg you. This has got to stop. Hollywood is going to keep making these kinds of movies as long as we keep wasting our money going to see them.  I'm all about supporting Black actors and all and I don't totally blame them, but c'mon?? A plane with hydraulics and spinners?  Is that REALLY funny?  I'm all for a good comedy, but all I ask for is some balance.  How about a good Black drama or action movie? I had a heated discussion about Black cinema the other night so I'm not going to go into it in depth right now, but some of y'all may remember this old Public Enemy song, all I have to say is "Burn, Hollywood, Burn".   Voting: Go vote in November, it only takes a few minutes.   The War: I'm not going to get into my feelings on the war other than I am against it. But I just found out that a friend of my brother and myself is leaving on Monday for Iraq. God bless him and his family. I hope he makes it back to see his daughter grow up.   The Youth: This is for the Black men especially, they need us.  If you have young kids in your neighborhood, talk to them, guide them, be a positive influence. Find a young Black boy in your neighborhood and be his friend.  Give them things to do. Pay them a few dollars to wash your car or clean your yard. Teach them the value of hard work. Then teach them to save some of the money that they just earned.  Show them a picture of a friend of yours that you lost in the streets and tell him why your friend is no longer living. Teach them that there is more to life, than the streets.  If you don't ever listen to me, listen now, save the children.   My quote for the day: "Do not wait for ideal circumstances, nor the best opportunities; they will never come." --Janet E. Stuart   Until next time, be easy....       "Bugs" By Salvador Gabor   Recently, I've heard alot of talk of certain bugs or insects that will appear in bunches and annoy us for a few weeks and then leave for about 17 years. These bugs come around for about 2 weeks, every 17 years or so. We see them and the whole time that we see them, they make lots of noise and we can't wait until they're gone. No I'm not talking about "Cicadas", I'm talking about "Baby Fathers".   As a man, I feel that when I decide to have kids, I will take responsibility for my kids. FULL responsibility that is! I don't use the term "Baby Father" but, if you only come around for two weeks, mate with the "baby mother" and leave again for "17 Years", then that's what you are. It's always been funny to me to see "baby fathers" in action. They straighten up for a little while. They start going to church and all of a sudden everyone else is dead wrong if they are not headed to church on the Sunday when the "baby father" is headed to church. All of a sudden, the "baby mother" seems to just always have to drop his name in EVERY conversation. "Oh girl, Big Bill bought me this". "Big Bill was JUST saying the SAME thing honey!". "Big Bill took lil Bill to get a suit". But, it seems that the "baby mother" should know that "Big Bill" aint gonna be around long. He might drop off a short-set for your son and some sneakers, lay you down and sleep with you for a while but, then he's gone again.   The funniest thing about these "cicada-like" creatures is that they make ALOT of noise. These "baby fathers" come around and all of a sudden, the children are supposed to straighten up and fly right. How can you expect a boy or girl to listen to their mother, do their chores, behave in school and be the child they should be if you weren't around to instill these principles into the children? How can you expect much from a kid, if you haven't planted your seeds of knowledge? These "baby fathers" like to come right in from their extended absences and begin to "whip" and "beat" on the kids. When you haven't laid down the example for your children all you can do is hope that they turn out right. You can never  expect  a positive outcome. That child knows as much as you do that sooner or later, you will leave. You came around for Easter Sunday and you may be here for Memorial Day. You might even make it until the 4th of July but, when the holidays run out and you've gotten enough of that "baby mother" and what's between her legs, you WILL roll.   So for all of you who will be out and about this summer, have your pesticide sprays and "off" sprays out. The "cicadas" are out and about.

       Sal's Corner "One Letter"    Spelling is a critical component to getting your point across from a written standpoint. There are so many words that can be spelled incorrectly so easily. I have a hard time posting columns because I have to proofread so much. One thing that I've noticed is that one letter can change everything. One letter turns one word turns into another. The effects of that one letter can be monsterous   *Suite VS. Suit: A suite is an upscale office or a hotel room. A suit can be an article of clothing or a legal case. A man in a suit can go to a suite with a woman and catch a SUIT. Just ask Kobe Bryant. That letter "I" made a BIG difference in the two words  *Effect VS. Affect: I've never gotten this one down pat. I STILL dont know when to use either. I just use em both and yall get the drift anyway.  *Skootch VS. Skoontch: Both are used to suggest or ask that someone move down or out of your way. When an old lady says "Skootch over a lil bit", she probably is at a graduation or a church service. Skootch is said quietly out of the reverance for the event. She may be even at a Black College Football game, who knows. But, the word Skoontch!!!! "Skoontch on........Skoontch on out the way". That is a very good sign that it's some Barbeque ribs somewhere in the vicinity. Something hot, spicy or very good is being served and you are just not moving fast enough for ole Sister Robinson. But, that letter "N" adds alot of funk to the lingo.  *Trip VS. Trap: We've all been through this. What seems to be a good outing turns bad. We all have that friend that is cool.........but, sometimes (most of the time) can be a hassle. They are very cool but, they always put you in a compromising situation. They ask for a ride to one place and after that it's "Run me here" or "Just 5 more minutes, stop me pass the other store" or "What you bout to do?...if you got some time could you........". A trip turns into a trap!  *Desert VS. Dessert: Could you imagine someone saying "My cousin got his leg blown off in Dessert Storm"? I'd probably thing he banged his leg on the bottom of the counter at Ben & Jerry's on "Free Ice Cream Day". How about your kid asking you........"Can I have ice cream for Desert?" I'd wonder if the kid wanted some Neopolitan packed in his lunch pale for his school trip to the Sahara???  *Holiday Vs. Holyday: Now Holy Day is not one word but, let's just assume it is for now. Holidays are days that we get off from work and that we get and/or give gifts on. They come and go and if you don't give somebody their gift ON that day, they will have a FIT. But a Holyday should be a day where we acknowledge what the day is actually about. The difference in the spelling of the two words are substituting an "I" for a "Y". And literally that's what we SHOULD do with these days. Take the "I" out and ask "WHY". Christmas is not about Santa Claus, Valentine's Day is not about giving balloons and Mother's Day is not about loving a mother on ONE day of the year. These Holiday/Holyday's are not about YOU, so take the "I" out  *Honies VS. Homies: First off, it's 2004 so if a dude is running around still calling females "honies" he is caught up in some 1994 cookout memories. But the "honies" are the ladies. The gals, the gang, or the womenssss. "Homies" are the fellas, the crew, the dogs. Fellas, if you email or instant message your wife/girlfriend, she would be HEATED if you type "Im chillin wit da Honies tonight". That "M" changed to an "N" could be deadly!  *Own VS. Owe: Many people buy cars or possessions and tell you that they "OWN" them. NO most likely they "OWE" on them. Please believe it. Many people lease cars and you never know it. Ever wonder why they can NEVER drive outta town? They gotta car sitting in the driveway but they caught the bus to Detroit for Thanksgiving. Wonder why they tried to squeeze in your car to ride down to Kings Dominion or Six Flags? They dont "OWN" it.    *Trickin VS. Trackin: These two words are representatives for the different levels in monetary male/female relationships. Relationships built on money aren't good for the soul. Feelings get involved and if the money begins not to be involved, the party expecting the money will be upset. Ladies/Fellas be careful of how you "trick" on someone. You may catch feeling and begin to try to "track" that person. This could get outta hand.   Bonus.... *Expect VS. Except. This is an instance where the same letters are used for both words. The only change is the swapping of places for the letters "C" and "P". Usually we start out friendships, relationships, job etc. etc. EXPECTING alot. Then later on, we get everything EXCEPT what we want. Ladies, all you ask is to be taken out. The guy doesn't do that but, he'll call you all day! The dude will call you at 7:00, knowing that your free minutes aint until 9:00. Fellas, all you ask is that she be quiet. So then, she thinks she can get over by talking about something you want to talk about. But, then she gets it wrong. "YOU GOTTA BE CRAZY....OH so they're not gonna call OFFSIDES on Shaq!" Or how about at work. All you ask for is a raise or a bonus. But they turn around and just give you $700 worth of credit at Staples. "I SURE could use some binder clips right about now". It's funny we get everything EXCEPT what we EXPECT.    Remember, make sure you spell your words right and use them right. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"      "American Idol" By Salvador Gabor    It's crazy how people get wound up in television. Yes I watch alot of TV. ALOT of TV! But, when I turn off the TV, I "try" to leave what's on the TV behind when the power is shut off. But, some people are SO into every show. "Girl did you see the Bachelor last night, I thought sure Jessica was going home!".  People watch soap operas, court shows and reality shows like their OWN lives are on the line. Like, they are the ones facing elimination! They make these "characters" out to be "for real". This is corny to say but,.......... it's only a TV show!   One show in particular that really bothers me is "American Idol". The title itself bothers me the most. I look at the word "Idol" and I think of some megastar and nowadays WHO KNOWS what "American" really means. But, the idea is to expose "America's" most talented Amateurs and these contestants compete for a recording contract. In many cases, who we as people "feel" should win don't always win. On top of that, if the people we want to win actually do win, some way or another, the person that "they" wanted to win finds a way to get a spot in the limelight any way.  You see, "American Idol" is not about voting for the best singer/performer. Often times, it's about bringing back that old-fashion pop star. For a lack of better wording............the old "Caucasian Superstar Singer". African-Americans dominate virtually every genre of music known to man. The most popular genres in the country are Rap, R&B, Soul, Gospel, Rock & Roll and Country. Now, there are some other popular ones but, these stand out. Even the ones that are not dominated by African Americans have picked up on some African American culture and implemented that style within it's music. Country, Rock & Roll and other genres have "spiced" up their music a bit and has some African American "undertones".   The set-up of the show is strange. Now correct me if I'm wrong ,because I haven't watched the show more than twice. But, I believe that there are three celebrity judges that pick the contestants that advance to the "main event" yet, the public gets to vote for the final winners. It just seems like all of a sudden, the talented judges who know about the industry give the vote to the fans across the world who don't know as much about true talent???? It doesn't make much sense. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe those aren't the rules for the show. Will I ask someone how it really goes............NO! I don't care. I could care less who gets the recording contract. But, I do know that some of the most talented amateur artists are being eliminated.   "American Idol" is the idea of bringing back the "Doo-Wop" days. Back when kids drove Chevy's and drunk milkshakes. The guys wore varsity jackets and the girls wore long skirts and white shoes. There were drive-in movies and everything was so "innocent". Or at least that's what "innocence" is made out to be. Quite frankly, "America" is tired of hearing singers talk about "Bentley's", "Cheating Boyfriends" and "Baby Momma Drama" and other similar topics that seems to flood the airwaves. And there are African-American artists who go outside of those topics for songs. But, in this country, many times what ONE person does is looked at as what we ALL do. "America" wants a singer that "appears" to be "a good ole wholesome person". The "American Idol" will be someone that "America" can look to. Really, there's nothing wrong with that. Just understand that if you are looking for Keisha, Shaneequa, or Kamal to win "American Idol"........that won't happen in "America".

      "Tips While in the Jungle" By Salvador Gabor  Today is Friday. The Friday before Memorial Day. The Friday before the holiday that marks the day that everyone starts acting real niggerish. I just feel yall need a "Heads Up" on what to expect. I would hate to see you guys caught off guard. Here are a few things. I won't elaborate but, just take them into mind and know that it's a strong possibility that you will see them   * People who you deem to be "too old" blasting hip-hop in the ride  * Tank Tops. Tank tops are normally seen but not the regular ones. But the ones with the real thin shoulders and they hang down real low will be out. Off colors like Purple and Red too!  * A "Cuss-Out". Niggas get entirely too drunk on Memorial Day Weekend. This is the weekend where someone might find out that their uncle is really their daddy  * Adults bringing beer to kids' birthday parties. No gifts for the child, just Buds and Heinekens.  * You are bound to see a co-worker downtown somewhere with his girlfriend. His whole attitude is different. He aint nothing but a mail clerk on the job site but he gotta 325 BMW and a short set on with some shades.

       "Excerpts from a Diary : volume 5.27.04" By Salvador Gabor    Dear Diary,  Today was a very tough day. I started my day out early. I gotta "page" from Ms. Ruby around the corner. She wanted a "dime" rock but I only planned to sell "twenties" and "fifties" today. It was 6:00 A.M. and she had already woke me up so, I "served" her.  At about 9:00 A.M., the block was pumpin! The "first" is a few days away but, my "yiggidities" couldn't stay in my pocket.........or should I say my "back pocket". I keep my "crack" tucked in my drawls. I bet the neighbors probably think I don't wash good and my butt is itching but, Im gettin' this paper. Mrs. Alberta is always in her window looking at me. I'm glad she's deaf. If not she could tell EVERYTHING on me.  At about 1:30 P.M., the "feds" rolled through. I aint trippin' off them niggas. They some suckas anyway. They stopped, put me on the car and tried to go in my socks looking for "crack". By that time, I was just waiting on "Lil Bear" to come serve me wit some more weight. I was dry as skin on an elbow. So they had to let me go.  3:45, I'M BACK! "Lil Bear" just gave me what I need to continue my pumpin. I made $300 this morning, and I don't plan on sleeping no time soon. hmmmmmmm I should just wear this sweatsuit ALL weekend. So what....... it's Memorial Day............YEP that's it, mind's made up! I'm out here on these bricks ALL night in the same clothes till Tuesday!  5:50 P.M. Yesterday I told myself...........I said "C-Bone, you are not gonna slap, kick, steal, punch, or shoot ANYMORE Dope Fiends!". Well that lasted about 17 hours. Cause "Dirty Percy" came around the corner and bought some "yay" from my man "Scoot". AND IN MY FACE FOR THAT MATTER! That nigga Percy KNOW he owe me $17. I gave him a $40-rock for $23. Percy, you aint slick nigga. I know you spent that $17 on a bottle of "Andre". I don't even do credit. So I took a cylinder brick and hit em in the gut. YEP, the gut. When I picked it up, he thought I was going for the face so he covered up. Open season on that rib-cage. When I hit em there, he fell and me and "Scoot" stomped em out. "Scoot" still had his $20 and never "served" em.   9:00 P.M. Baby Moms came through. I had Shemia in the other room. Shemia comes out to get some Mad Dog out the fridge and that's when things went down hill. Knives were pulled and they weren't pointed at each other. They both went to chase me.   2:30 A.M, So here I am, no socks, no shoes, no pants, no shirt. Just some boxers and a pen, writing this entry. Shemia and Baby Moms have locked me out. I should have never went in the house any ole way! I said I was out here ALL weekend. Out here bangin on this block tryna get some "ink". I see "Gary the Mechanic" coming. He may want some "butter". Lemme check my "inventory". And NO Mrs. Alberta...........my butt isnt itchin!   Yours Truly, Carlton "C-Bone" Williams

       "CIAA Champeens" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    We would like to salute the CIAA Champion Virginia State "Bulls".  The "Lady Bulls" took home the CIAA Championship in "Big Girls Jump Rope" this past weekend in Durham, NC.  Not to be mistaken with the "Woo-Woo's", the "Moo Moo's" celebrated their 1st Conference Championship in the past 5yrs, and 8th in the past 2 decades.  The "Moo Moo's" defeated Shaw, St. Augustine's and the heavily favored Lady Bruins of Bowie State.   The Moo Moo's won their "Big Girls Jump Rope Chamionship" on the strength of their quartet of 250 pound jumpers, called the "4 Quarters".  Veronica Blackwell, Candy Thomas, NaKeisha Davenport, and Jamie Bowman moved as gracefully as sugar monkeys swinging through banana trees.  They performed their routines "Lemon-Lime", "Jello Boogie", "Potato Salad", and "Poison Ivy City".  These young heavies showed their extraordinary skill and footwork all season and it paid off in Durham this past weekend.   3 of the "4 Quarters" are from Washington, DC, and the fourth, Candy Thomas is from Henrico, which is just outside of Richmond.  Oh but Jamie Bowman, aka "Big Bowman" took home the tournament's MOP, sponsored by the "Really-Dough Doughnut Shop".  The Most Obese Performer, "Big Bowman" sewed up the title with her individual performance in the double-rope with a dazzling performance she calls "Honey Mustard".  Veronica Blackwell, aka "Downtown", took second in the competition.  Blackwell was elated after her team's victory, and led the "Moo Moo's" in their victory dance, "Shake it like a Polarbear on Roids".      "Ole Justice" By Salvador Gabor    "Justice", I'm writing this love letter to you because, I don't think that you and I see things on the same wave-length anymore. I am hurt and upset at the fact that you've treated me this way for so long. I took all of the punishment that you threw at me. What's messed up is.......I really loved you "Justice". Where did we go wrong? How did all of this happen?  When I was introduced to you, I was told that you couldn't see that well. Matter of fact when I got your number, I called you the next day and you didn't even remember my face. I never looked at your vision as a setback because, "Love is Blind". And I love you "Justice".............well at least I thought I did.   "Justice", after we met, I started noticing things about you. Things that I didn't like. I am supposed to be your friend yet, I'm criticized for EVERYTHING I do. All the while, your rich friends get away with murder (literally)! You give me brief conversation but, your rich friends come and see you for days and days only to be "slapped on the wrist" when they do something dangerous. In my life, if I make a mistake, it's probably harmless at first. If I break a rule, it's probably "just to get by". I don't mean any harm at all. If I did anything to hurt you, it may have been because I couldn't visualize the whole scheme of things. Yet, your rich buddies KNOW what they are doing and you let them "slide".   Even though I am a man, I looked to you for protection. You were the woman that stood strong for me when those people in high places tried to take advantage of me. You used to let your "cousins" on your father side (The Jury Family) sit and listen to me when I had a problem. Then your rich friends turned around and bought them out too.   I'm not going to rant and rave. All I can say "Justice" is that we had something. It was special. I was the gentlemen that I thought you needed in your life. Whenever we "ate", I waited for YOU to get "served" first. But, when you "eat" you are never satisfied. And I'M definitely not satisfied because I never get to eat AT ALL. "Justice", I DON'T love you anymore. I really don't. You are a two-timing, money hungry, stingy brat. And you weren't there for me when I needed you. I've taken all of the blame for the bad things that were passed on to me from your high-ranking friends. I admit, I was wrong and you don't have to treat me special. Just treat me fairly. That's all I ask of you "Justice"    Yours Truly, Leslie "Nigga" James

       LSE Success Tip (5/25/04) By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.     "Dont drink hot orange juice, it might be made by Sonny and Dwight"  --Phillip "Buckets" McGraw--    "Courage" is that nigga in the dark alley, wearing a T-shirt in December.  He tries to look like "Tough", since they share the same clothes.   "Confidence" is man who wears many hats.  He hangs out in PTA meetings, counseling centers, and with pimps.  Everybody needs "Confidence"..... from disinfranchised youth, to battered wives, to a hooker not exceeding her earning potential.   "Support" is a hard dude to catch up with.  However I will tell you where to find him.  He often attends many repasses, is on the phone with jailed buddies, and in the dressing room at Hechts. "Support" is needed by all, from the grievers to the wrongfully incarcerated, to a woman looking for an underwireless life.   "Succeed" is that old man who teaches elementary school.  You hear so much about him as a youth.  Just because he is old doesnt mean he knows nothing, ask him about his son "Success".   "Receptive" is a nigga you might pass everyday on the street.  If you would only take that walkman off, you might learn something.   One eye closed might not necessarily be a wink, it might be a stigmatic twitch in an eye hit with a switch.  Close one eye and see if things get clearer, if they dont go wash thine eye, any sleep in your eye that lasts more than five minutes after awakening is no longer sleep, it is just nast.        Remember the Time?  By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.    "Back in the day when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore but some days I sit and wish I was a kid again."  Ironically, I can't remember the guy that made this classic song, but I remember that feeling. I wish I could go back to the mid eighties and early nineties again. Back when being a kid, really meant being a kid and not getting shot by a stray bullet every other week.  We are the last generation that actually had childhoods. When we were coming up, sadly it was said that just making it to 21 was an accomplishment.  Nowadays, making it to 15 is miracle!  Today's youth won't have anything to look back and reminisce on beside funerals at this rate.  We have to save the children y'all but in the meantime, let's do like Pete Rock and CL Smooth and reminisce...    Remember the "Free Mike Tyson" t-shirts?   Remember Boston Baked Beans candy? The best part was blowing on the empty box and having a bootleg Kazoo.   Remember .15 cents bag of sunflower seeds for the broke kids that didn't have .50 cents for a big bag?   Remember kickball at recess?   Remember the big party on the last day of school? Everybody brought potato chips.   Remember permission slips? (Married men still have to get theirs signed.)   Remember Young MC? (Now don't just stand there bust a move!)   Remember Video Soul?   Remember when MTV didn't show any Black videos?   Remember when there was no cable and TV "went off" around 2:00 AM?   Remember Push Pops?   Remember Church's Chicken?   Remember Officer Friendly and the Side By Side Band? (If you went to DC public schools, you know.)   Remember lunch tickets?   Remember when the Metro bus cost 85 cents?   Remember the Smurfs?   Remember Teen Wolf? The Goonies?   Remember Troop? No, not the singing group, the tennis shoes?   Remember that song, "Liiiiiiiiife, life is what you make it, so come here, my dear. Tryyyyy and make it, I know that you wiiillllll. RAGGAMUFFIN, love come gimme da raggamuffin." (Who sang that?)   Remember when crack "came out"?   Remember Super Tims?   Remember when Michael Jackson was really the King of Pop? (And how every kid ruined their grandmother's communion gloves by putting glue and glitter all over them.)   Remember flat-top haircuts? Remember getting lines in the side of your head (*Cough* *Cough* Michael Irvin)   Remember when Doug "Touch of Class" Williams won Super Bowl MVP and we got out of school for the parade?   Remember pencil fighting? Spork fighting? (Spork fighting was truly an art.)   Remember when Eddie Murphy was funny? When we were kids, he was for the adults. Now that we're grown, he's all about the kids.   Remember when Prince actually wore purple?   Remember Freaky Friday?   Remember 500 C Street?   Remember playing "That's my car!"   Remember playing "Throwback"?   Remember Bart Simpson T-shirts?   Remember Dear God, It's Me Margaret? (I know the ladies remember this book.)   Remember when we didn't know what e-mail or cell phones were?   Remember pencil pocket Guess jeans?   Remember when Big Macs came in those styrofoam boxes?   Remember "Zayres"?   Remember the "Ya Mama's on Crack Rock Song"? (Not my mama)   Remember getting a whooping for actually doing something wrong and not because you were just walking too slow?   Remember when our parents actually spent time with us and took us places instead of depending on the school to take you on a field trip?   Remember the good ol' days?    I miss 'em.

       Sal's Corner "Hygiene Tips"    It's hot outside. Plain and simple. The hotter it gets, the better you BETTER smell. In the cold, people aren't out much. When they are, they are rushing to get out of that cold. On top of all that, most of us have the "sniffles" and cant smell that funk if it's near. But, you better straighten up and fly right in this here summer!   * Baby Powder - This is optional. Baby Powder DOES make you feel a bit more fresh. But, when you put it on........if I can SEE the powder......such as it being on your neck or legs, just wipe that portion off. Powder is meant for the places we CAN'T and shouldn't see. If we can see the powder, that means you put too much. You don't need powder ALL on your neck. You downtown at lunch looking like you just left your part time job at BOJANGLES........... "Girl you gotta put your ELBOW in dem biscuits!!".  * Socks and shorts - OK old men, maybe YOU need some powder in YOUR shoes instead of wearing socks with Khaki shorts. You don't want your feet to stink but I don't need you looking like you getting ready to play Women's Volleyball either.  * Women and shorts - Ladies I know sometimes yall wanna relax. You may not have the proper relaxing gear. You might go out and want to change into something else. You may get dirty and want to throw on some of our gym shorts. But don't make us force you to keep the shorts once you are done. Sometimes yall sweat out our shorts and when you give them back, all we need is some bread and tarter sauce to make the "Fish Sandwich" complete.   * Deodorant - We're not gonna stay on this one long. I feel if you aren't homeless and you call yourself a sane individual then, I assume that you use some sort of deodorant. Well just make sure if you have on a tank-top, cut-off tee or a blouse that exposes your whole arm, use roll-on deodorant. That crumbly deodorant is seasonal. All that white residue leaves yall arms look like old jean pockets. You might find lint, cotton balls or an old receipt from the "Great American Buffet" under there.   * Undershirts - This is angled to the fellas. You NEED undershirts. Sometimes tank-tops don't do it. If that white shirt is too thin, your back will be showing once that sweat starts in this heat. That white-tee becomes sheer in 90 degree weather. The undershirt maintains the form of your shirt along with capturing the majority of the sweat. Now, we are not gonna even talk when you are dressed up! PLEASE don't wear dress shirts without some form of an undershirt.  * Candy - The most sure way to clear up bad breath is simply a better diet. Bad breath comes from within. But, a short remedy is candies. Mints, gum, lollipops, etc. can give you an instant sweetness when you talk. In the summer you run from cookout to cookout. You leave one and go to another. People can't even focus on you and what you are saying. All the person can hear is that bag of onions coming up from your throat.   * Bathing - (I gotta BOLD this WHOLE SECTION).  Im dead serious on this one. I heard something the other day that I haven't heard in some time now. I heard an ADULT say, "Im gonna take a bath tonight so I aint gotta take one in the mornin'". WHAT!!!!!!!!!! Lemme tell yall something. A bath/shower at night does not suffice for tomorrow. Babes.......it's a new day! That shower on 6/1/04 don't mean nothing for 6/2/04. I take showers in the morning AND at night. The morning shower makes me straight for the rest of my day and the night shower makes my sleep more comfortable. If I DON'T take one at night, it's cause I wasn't moving too much that day or I took my first shower very late (Day off from work). But BEST believe, I aint leaving the house for WORK without showering. Yall ought to be ASHAMED of yall selves. Putting on your "good" clothes and you AINT EVEN put no soap on your "tater". "WASHUPS" do NOT count baby! Wiping that ole rag on your face, ears, underarms and between yo' legs aint it playboy. You got to hit that water for real playa! In the summer, I might take 2 showers AND a "Washup". Im a grown man. It's gets funky out chere. That "take a bath at night for tomorrow" is for kindergarteners. When you turn about 8 and you start getting musty...........and Mom's says it's time to start using deodorant..........that "take a bath at night for tomorrow" stuff is gone out the window.     These are just a few good tips needed for all you "too grown to be funky" people out here.    A Good Hoodrat  By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.    Salutations all, I hope every one is doing well on this glorious day.  As many of you know, I am an attorney in Washington, DC and in my life, I must say that I have been privileged to have many experiences that many can only dream of.  I grew up in the "hood" but, I have risen above the obstacles that have made many others stumble.  I have shaken the hands of Presidents, Congressmen, and Judges.  I have broken bread with famous celebrities and I have traveled the world. I have dated beautiful women, many of whom are considered to be in the "upper echelon" of society.  In my dealings with these so-called "high class" women, I have learned a very important life lesson. For all the glitz and glamour that comes with these women, I realized that I need a good " hoodrat ".  You see, you can take me out the hood, but you sure can't take the hood out of me. So fellas, find yourself a good hoodrat and embrace her "hoodratness."  The benefits of a good hoodrat are endless.  Let's discuss...    A good hoodrat brings her own liquor and weed to the party.   A good hoodrat keeps a shank on her at all times (and knows how to use it).   A good hoodrat knows how to make a mean bowl of grits.

       "What's in the yard?" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   As summertime comes upon us, many of us take a look at ourselves and see just what we can do to better our appearance. Little do we know, it all starts from within, but check behind you too, as your mamma would say "clean up behind yourself".  A lot of people often focus with getting their hair did, their fingernails done, and getting some rims. They believe this will help them in their summertime pursuit for a Display for a New Portrayal. All of this sounds good, but let me ask you this...what's in the "yard"? You go out and wash and wax that car, but what about that old pickup in the "yard"?  You want to have a cookout at the house, but your dog "Pebbles" has "marked" every corner, path, and brick of the patio. Now the yard smells like Benji's gravesite. You and Tony like to sit on the backporch and drink beers in your sparetime, nigga put them cans and bottles in the recycling bin. You cant possibly think Lajuan and both Keishas are going to want to sit amongst all those 40's.  So you don't have a dog, and you have cleaned up the beer cans, so you ready for the cookout. Nigga what's in the "yard"? Five grills are in the "yard", so you can have a cookout but, put some of them in the alley for trash pickup, so Keith and Dewey can have a sit down when they come over. Too many grills and not enough seats, sounds like a KC Masterpiece Cookoff, and not a Tony and Earl Cookout.  You got your two grills, caged the dog up, and cleaned up the beer cans, nigga I hope you cut what's left of your grass. Got so many weeds back there, the ATF drives by 3 sometimes 4 times a week. Oh and you moved the pickup but, what's in the "yard"?  That Camaro and that Buick that's what. Tell Tony to park them cars at his own house.  People always say make sure your house is in order before starting a new life venture like marriage, but make sure that "yard" is in order to. Come to grips with what is immediately behind you prior to inviting someone into your life/house/yard/cookout. If that yard aint clean, don't wonder why the ladies leave early. Mosquitos, long itchy grass, and Pebbles' pebbles won't keep either of the Keishas there too long, but ole Buttaface Matilda might be there til the end. Clean that "yard" or you are sure to meet a nigga unwanted..............      "Funkytown" By Salvador Gabor    When I was young I remember people singing a song ".......I want you to take me to FUNKY TOWN!!!!!!!!!". I never really took that song literally. I knew there was no such thing as a "Funkytown". I hear that song sometimes on commercials or on TV shows and I pay it no attention. But, recently I was taken to "Funkytown". Oh yes, it is a city! I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. But, it wasn't. This town is sho' nuff Funky!  Now that I think of it, I've been to a few "Funkytowns". These towns have a distinct smell. Smog and smoke have filled the air. The people who live in this town are full of that funk that a "Funkytown" has to offer. No, the citizens of these towns take showers. They still stink.   One of the first towns I went to that really stunk was "NEWPORT news". "NEWPORT news" has a distinct smell. I can't even explain it. The next town I went to that was funky was "upper MARLBORO". Real REAL funky for ya. If you go down a lil further you may see ole "BENSON" working in his "HEDGES". Sometimes he does it by himself or he might call his nephew "VIRGINIA SLIM" to come on over and work a lil bit. Most "Funkytowns" don't have animals. The smoke and smog kills them off. Only "CAMELS" can survive in these "Funkytowns".  But, see........the song says "........I want you to take me to Funkytown". That lets you know that I have to ASK to be taken to "Funkytown". You can't KIDNAP me and force me to go there. You can stay in your town when you are on your cigarette breaks but, freshen on up a bit before you push 5 on that elevator door. 'Cause when you come back upstairs smelling like folgers and ashtrays, you have JUST taken me to "Funkytown".

       "A Nigga You Never Want to Meet, Part 1" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      In life there are some people that you hear old people warn you about.  Some are good folks with a bad reputation, and others just bad and evil niggas with no moral foundation.  You would often hear "Don't play with Jamal that boy is bad" but, all the while he just misses his dad.  But, there is one dude that old folks knew was bad from the jump, and would bother you no matter what you do.  "That Arthur, that ole Arthur."   Ole "Arthur", the type of boy to make your grandmother cuss.  "Arthur" goes unnoticed by many youth, they have no idea of the havoc he wrecks on the stairs bending over to get a false tooth.  Ole "Arthur", ooh he is a devilish boy, he once tried to trip my grandaddy on the steps, like a stray toy from his grandboy.  Ole "Arthur" grabbed his knee, and tried to pull him down.  I just heard "that Ole Arthur tried to get me" but, I saw nothing as I looked around.  Not a man or a boy, or even that stray toy, didn't even see my uncle named Lee, whose given name is Arthur as a little boy.   As I look around often hearing about this "Arthur", I just think he must be one busy somebody.  He's in the kitchen and the bedroom, the bathroom and the basement.  I'm checking the ceiling and even the dusty vents, just who is this "Arthur" going around punching and grabbing my grandparents.  Who is this coward who plays "Punchbuggy" all through the day.  "Arthur" "Arthur" "Arthur", he makes you wanna scour the streets, questioning every new lil guy you meet "Is this Arthur, could this be the dreaded dreaded Arthur?  Is this the boy punching my grandma in the back, squeezing her wrist and keeping her off my back?  Is this that Arthur who kicked my granddad in the knee, or twisted grandma's ankle like a wicked root of the tree?"   I dont know who this "Arthur" may be, but if he is causing all this trouble, I'm gonna have to check with somebody.  "Ma who is Arthur and has he been bothering you? He has been running wild at grandma's like a monkey at the zoo....Arthur's been here, he aint been in my room, wait til I grow up I show him something that goon."  Little did I know no matter how old he gets ole "Arthur" never forgets, your birthdays, weddings, or even a walk downstairs.  That nasty young nigga should have a sign that says "beware".  He may not be a dog, but his bite is worse, just the other day he made Ms. Mattie cry like someone stole her purse.  He got her elbow, then her toe.  I just wonder is there no limit to how low he will go.   Ole "Arthur", a nigga that you never want to meet. Trust me when I tell you.........he might even wake you out your sleep.  Now I aint for no killing, but I think them old folks would understand if "Arthur" was killed by a murderous hand.  Be careful on them steps, and at the Pilates class, ole "Arthur" might grab your knee, hip, or the back of your "surface".  So if you rolling around in pain like a 45 yr old contortionist at the circus, not to worry, that is just "Arthur" so dont hurry, just sit yourself down and get to know that Tiger Balm.  Like that old lady on the Tylenol commerical rubbing she palm, you just met "Arthur", ole "Arthur" indeed.      "The Streak" By Salvador Gabor   Life is a game of "Streaks". Seems as if when you are winning, you can lose. When you are losing, you can't even get a cheap victory. "Streaks" are waves that we ride when we are on top and they can be lessons we learn from when we are on the bottom.  There have been some long streaks in the history of mankind. Cal Ripken's streak of over 2,000 consecutive games played in baseball is one. How about that old man on your job who wears the same sweater and arrives at work at 5:30 every morning. That's a great streak! Or the streak of shootings that took place over in that project down the street from you. 27 straight nights of bussin off aint no joke. But, whether it's good or bad, a "streak" leaves a lasting impression.  What about the bad "streaks"? Well........what about em? We all know about good "streaks" and if you are on one right now, ride it out as long as you can. But, I want to deal with those who are in a bad "streak". No, not an unemployment "streak". Naw, not a losing "streak" with the opposite sex. Not even a bad "streak" of parking tickets. This is a "streak" that we all are "on top of" but, we can't handle sometimes. This "streak" is definitely a losing "streak" and we need desperately to get out of it.   When we get into this particular "streak", it's because we have not properly gotten rid of that "mess" that lie within us. We let this "mess" linger. We even begin to see this "mess" as being ok to deal with. We let it become apart of our lives and we begin to "gas" ourselves up. We get so "gassed" that we think we can just let this mess blow out of us slowly instead of "dumping" it. "I will change one day!". "I'm not ready to get rid of the mess". Don't let that "mess" fool you. It will surely "gas" you up. Next thing you know, you will have a "streak" on your hands..............or DRAWLS, I should say. Yep, this message is not about life...........I just took you guys around the block a few times to say this...........    IT'S HOT OUTSIDE. WE SWEAT. WE EAT ALL THIS FOOD. AND WE FART. YES WE ALL DO. BUT, CLEAN YOURSELF OUT. ONE FART IS OK BUT, IF YOU FART ALL DAY, IT WILL BE HARD TO TAKE THAT BROWN "STREAK" AWAY.      This message has been brought to you by "The National Association of Men who Handwash their Drawls before their Wives do Laundry". They are also simply known as "United Nasty Niggas, Inc.".

      I apologize for my absence on Monday and Tuesday. But, I'm back with a very special Wednesday edition of Sal's Corner. Also check out this website..............www.np4p.com This is a site that has GREAT art work for those who are into the arts and photography. And now onto this weeks edition of Sal's Corner...........    Sal's Corner "Attention Black Men"   Ask anyone that knows me and they will tell you......."Sallimo" is not about that "Black Man, Black Man, Black Power" stuff. I love being Black, yet JUST because you are Black doesn't mean that we are more brothers than another man of another race. ALL humans are brothers and sisters in my eye. I've never shunned the help of a person from another race, nor do I migrate to a person of my own hue for the sake of complexion or race. Yet, I still feel a need to talk to the Black man. This is because we catch alot of flack. More flack than alot of other males in this society. We have our mothers, girlfriends, wives, kids and others very dissappointed at us as a whole. Either they say that we are using our status to our advantage too much, we are not being the men we need to be for our youth and our women, or we just aren't doing anything at all in the eyes of those who look on from afar. So black men let's huddle up for a second. I gotta few things I wanna tell you.   *  Buying Homes  - Black men, PLEASE dont move to the suburbs. At least not if you dont have to. The key to turning around our young black men is being THERE for them. Most of us grow up in the inner-city, then we get a little piece of money and we move out to the "boonies". While living out there, we can't make a difference. Out there, all we can do is come through the hood and stop by. We might get a crackhead to wash our car and that'll give us enough time to have a convo or two with the old homies but, we need to come back to our communities. Our young black men need to see successful black men IN the inner-city. We need to get the inner-city to the point where it is as luxurious as the suburbs. It just takes a little time to instill pride into the citizens of the neighborhoods. This pride ensures that citizens will keep the streets clean. That cleanliness adds value to our neighborhoods. Our presence as strong and successful black men and speaking out to the next generation makes the young folks feel needed, appreciated and inspired as well. That inspiration adds a hope for the next generation and the future of our neighborhood.  *  Job Hunting  - If you dont need a job, pass on the info to another black brother, or ANYBODY willing to work for that matter. The reason why I mentioned passing the job info to another black brother is that in order for us to take back our neighborhoods, we need a team of folks working and doing positive things. So, if you have a job, passing the info to the unemployed or under-employed adds another black man IN the inner-city into a position where he can be a positive influence on an aspiring child. The more examples we have of a positive movement, the better chance we have of saving more of the youth. The youth may find it hard following ONE man but, following a group of men is much more easier. That group denotes power.   *  Golf  -  Stop playing golf!  This maybe funny to some but in a way, it's serious. It's not JUST about not playing golf, it's the idea that we dont have to completely conform to another culture to be successful. Of course, we have to conform to a certain extent. Whether it's maintaining a low and even haircut or wearing suits to work, we have to conform somewhat to survive. I just dont agree with these black men who play golf, drink starbucks and walk around with these semi-jheri curl/slicked back looking "do's" feeling as though they have to fit in. I dont like latte's and I dont need to putt a "-4" to close a business deal. Do you know when I was in college, professors had the nerve to say that business majors should pick up Golf as an elective class because you will need that in the business world to close deals???? Lemme tell you something.........any deal I close will be done in an office!! Period!  Now if you wanna come outside to a "rec" and shoot some hoops and close the deal, we can do that. But don't tell me that GOLF is gonna close the deal. My business skills IN the office will close the deal. What do I look like hitting a ball and chasing it. The only time I hit a ball was when I played HS Baseball and I had 9 other unfortunate opposing players chasing all the balls I hit over their heads! My whole point is, it doesn't matter if you shoot dice or play "throwback tackle" football in the street for recreation, when it comes to business, BUSINESS is the only thing that matters.  *  Chasing Women  - Fellas, in order for us to be better men for our loved ones, we gotta stop chasing women. Women like to see something that stands out in a man. Women like "stand-up" men. Women like men that handle their business. When we spend out time chasing them, we are not handling our business. Stop tryna "spit game" and tend to your responsibilities as a man. When you are doing what you are supposed to do, women will notice.   *  Speaking correctly  - "Nah'm saying?". Naw we dont "Man-Man", we REALLY dont know what you are saying. Dont feel that you are selling out when you talk proper. Understand that you are the only representative that you will have for yourself. Dont make yourself look like a fool.  *  Representation  - Understand ONE thing, life is not fair. Life is to the point now where we as black men represent EVERY black man when we walk out of the house. Like it or not, it's the truth. Caucasian people, Asian people, EVEN our own people take ONE instance where a black man was disrespectful or out of order and have let that image roll over into their perception of all young black men. It's gotten to the point where if 3 or 4 black men are standing outside, they HAVE to be selling drugs. Well, that's in the eyes of outsiders and that saddens me. And its OUR people who think that the most. When we gather as black men, people see trouble. It's a power that we have and everyone senses it. The next time you get off work and you're standing outside and people think you are hustling, make sure you are talking about something positive. Make sure that the 3 or 4 of you gathered together can do something RIGHT there on that street corner to make people who make assumptions about you all eat their words. If it's nothing but helping an old lady with bags or simply speaking to an older person, go beyond your pride and do it. We aren't given much credit in the first place, so a simple "hello" might shock them.   *  What a "man" is  - No you dont have to have sex with every woman to be a man. Dudes kill me walking around talking about how many women they have. Ok homie, that's cool. But when you go out of your way to tell me how many you have, I can only think of 1 or 2 things. 1) You feel that you have to prove something to ME. I'm a regular dude. You dont have to lie to me or boost stories to me or show off to me. 2) You feel that women wanting you makes you a better person. That's a sorry excuse for a man. Like I said before, if you choose to have 30 women, thats cool. Just dont think that i'm supposed to be impressed. If you have 30 women and you aint thinking about taking it to another level with NONE of them, then I question how "BAD" these women are. Either they all are ditzy, ugly or not worth your time for real. Because if I had my choice of 30 women, I may have played around with the thought of having them ALL, but at a point, one has to be a good enough woman to make me give her more or all of my attention versus chasing all 30. And believe me, it takes WORK to keep alot of women. Most guys who say they have alot of women, spend their time chasing em.   *  Weed  - Fellas, you gotta stop hittin "J's". Marijuana makes you slow down and do nothing. NOTHING at all. It makes you complacent and furthermore, it makes you feel that whenever there is a problem, you can just smoke it away. It takes away our memory and our ability to function. This is NOT the way to be what we need to be  *  Selling drugs  - Fellas, we gotta stop selling drugs. One thing that I know is, if black men REALLY knew the damaging affects that drugs have, they wouldn't sell it. Some hustlers have seen the damage first-hand from parents that were addicts but now that they are adults, these hustlers hide from those past images. The ones who have never seen it up close, dont want to gander at or wonder what it does to the addicts. Drugs take food out of mouths, clothes off of backs, self-esteem out of young children and chances away from children to have a fully functioning set of parents to guide them in the right direction.  * Understand the "System"  - Im not one to say that the "White Man" set-up or runs the "system". Im just saying that this "system" exists and it is right under our noses. This "system" makes us as blacks run to the suburbs and come back in town to work every morning. We try our hardest to be like the Bloombergs and the Kirkmeisters by moving out to their land. Now Sue and Bob are moving into the city and you look like a fool driving for 2 hours to get to work. The idea is simple. We are made to chase everything "they" do, then they switch it up. It's like a cat chasing his own tail. Understand that there is NO war on drugs. How can a government tell you how many pairs of Nikes are shipped in this country everyday but can't tell you how drugs are shipped in? They can capture Saddam, Noriega and any "baby-daddy"  ANYWHERE  in the world but they can't tell you why drugs are in this country? Powder cocaine might get you a slap on the wrist in court but "Crack" will get you a stiff bid to do down in the penitentiary. Who do YOU think smokes "crack"? Who do you think sniffs powder? Understand that we dont need to have sex with 50 women to be a "man". If you do that, then that is your choice but, dont think that makes you a bigger man. Those 50 women that you have left behind are scarred and probably wont have faith in a black man trying to be about a family. This is why the black family is broken. This is why young men dont want to get married or dont think about raising a family. Understand that drug and alcohol usage makes us feel that our current situation is "aight" as long as we have some remy and hydro to make it alright. The only elevation we look to is the high from the smoke. Understand that drug money might take you to the top but you might bring down hundreds of potentially great black people in the process.    Ladies, oh it aint sweet. I'm on your backs next Monday....And I promise that! This is my corner, and I'm glad that I can share it with you. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

         "Pioneers in the DC Rap Game" By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esquire    Born in the Bronx in 1975, hip hop music would grow to become the most influential culture of our generation. The lyrics, the beats, the dances, the clothes, the parties, the slang, the lifestyle. There was nothing like it. The music would travel beyond the 5 boroughs of New york and reach millions of people across the globe.  None were more affected than the young Black youth of the ghetto. In Washington DC, go-go music had been around for a while too, but three young boys decided to stray away from their hometown music and formed a rap group.   Sammy P. Carter and two of his friends named themselves, "DSL". They made songs whle "playing" in Sammy's basement watching Friday Night Videos and Care Bears re-runs on his mother's floor model TV.  They made schoolyard classics such as: "Booty Shorts & Now Laters", "Monkey Bars & Carpet Burn", "Calico Vision & Dad's Porno Tapes", "Ashy Knees & Sore Jaws" & the Mothers Day anthem "Ruby Lynn, Beatrice, & Willemina: We're not Gay, We're Just Close Like That". These guys were the predecessors to Another Bad Creation and The Boys. But they had a unique fan base, they didn't have pubescent girls for fans, the Catholic Archdiocese made these 3 young boys from DC the stars that they were.   Sammy's stage name was "Shorty Short Shorts" and his partners Daniel and Larry went by the names, "Danny the Whistle" & "Large Legged Larry"(Prince Markie Dee & Chunky A. from Arsenio were his idols.) They were in heavy rotation in the Cathedral and The Blue Oyster. Here is the cover from their first album, "Mustangs, Shades and Shorts".  That's Sammy shrugging his shoulders. (I don't have to say which one is "Large Legged Larry".)        "Juneteenth Bus Cruise" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       This is to inform you of the upcoming "Juneteenth Bus Cruise" to Memphis, Tennessee.  The cruise begins June 19th, the bus, number 750 named "Collards" will depart from Forrestville Mall at 6:45 sharp.  This contoured bus trip is due in rememberance of the Voyage of Odolpho, which occured June 20th, 1844. Odolpho, whose last name is thought to be Samuels, was a cropsharer in Memphis, TN. Well Odolpho was one of the first generators of Black Power. You see Odolpho felt he was a cropsharer, not a sharecropper. He felt he gave ole Mr. Sampson whatever he felt like giving him as opposed to whatever he wanted. Mr. Sampson was actually "Master Sampson", but Odolpho did not see fit to call another man "Master" seeing how he wasn't no dog, and since none of the dogs called him "Master" well shucks he wasn't about to either.  Odolpho created many empowerment opportunites for Blacks in Memphis. He organized a Blacksmith's union, specialized in Black BBQ, and upheld anything Black. Odolpho was determined to uplift his Black people and walked from Memphis to Tuskegee, AL dressed in all Black, stopping and talking to Blacks along the way. His voyage ended on June 20th in the year 1844, when Odolpho passed out from heatstroke and left this earth.  This Bus Cruise commemerates the 160th anniversary of the Voyage of Odolpho. The trip will stop thru Norfolk, for no particular reason other than Ms. Tredeau has some goodies to pickup from her cousin, continue down thru North Carolina where we will stop in Rocky Mount for dinner at "Curtis'", continue throughout the night where Willie Freeman has offered to split time with our bus driver until we get to Memphis. There will be a special dedication to Odolpho at Al Green's church that Sunday. Oh what a time we will have for Odolpho. So come on and get ready, please call Ethel Womack, she will handle this Bus Cruise just like the last one we had down Durham. For those of you who may have forgotten her number, 301-455-3534. That is her cell, she has been having some problems with her house phone, so leave a message.

       LSE Success Tip Vol. 6.09.04 By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.     "Stank finger denotes a lack of self worth, bad hygiene, and/or a bad choice in women"  --Dr. Tremaine "Buck" Naked--     Opinions by the misinformed, bring about insufficient inaccuracies, that don't fit like a bootleg khaki suit from Lorenzo's Boutique.   "Confidence" is not known by all, but is known by many people. Many of those who you think know "Confidence", have no idea of the power he possesses on the street. "Confidence" helped that ugly boy get your number, "Confidence" helped your fat friend Detrina get in the party for free. "Confidence" can help you do alot if you have the presence of mind to find him.  Hint: "Confidence" is always in "your house", check the basement, he might be trying to stay cool.   "Eye Contact" is a henchman of sorts. He will work for anybody. That girl who is unhappy with her date or mate, and uses a squirrel's eye hoping you will take the bait, begging and pleaded with her eyes hoping you will take her man by surprise and ask her for her phone number, or a far-fetched attempt to sell her some lumber.  "Eye Contact" is a nigga used by employers, whether the be government or street, using workers on the 3rd Floor or on K Street. "Eye contact" can get you some nookie or an unexpecting worker put in overtime, and maybe even a dancer named "Thunder" to make a more monetary "career change".   "Appearance" is a nigga who is deeper than what the surface suggests.  So dont overlook a ti-dye shirt or a party vest. "Appearance" may fool you, a sharp dressed person doesnt suggest money, or a stable mindset, it might suggest bootleg silk shirts and a nigga set in his ways like a rusty erector set.   "Authority" is a tricky nigga to say the least, and is more of a mindset but can be detrimental if you make it a beast. Treat yourself as "Authority" but dont go too far, snitching is prohibited, and so are sirens on your car, especially if you're just a parking attendant.     "Dont look a dance contest in the mouth, Solid Gold puts you one step closer to performing at Fonzo's on 7th and Up-and-Up Ave."               -Breaker Johnson- (1983 "Solid Gold" Try-Outs)

       "The Root of All Evil" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    There are many influences on society as a whole in this day and age. Some good, but many are detrimental. Money was once known as the root of all evil, and later crack-cocaine received much of this infamous glory. Black folks often refer to the "the man" better known as the white man for being the root of all evil. Through unbridled research of my own, I have come to realize it is but one man responsible for many of society's misfortunes.  Much like a politician, this man fills people with thoughts of happy things, even going as far as giving toys to kids. Through these dillusions his trickerygoes unnoticed as he works his grand scheme on the black community. This man even has promised plans of economic worth, guaranteeing a certain satisfaction for the masses. Like a Colombian coke dealer he has served over 60 billion. I think you might know this man I speak of, his name Ronald McDonald.  I know many of you, heavy and culinary-regressed people wonder how could I blame the beloved Ronald McDonald for problems in the black community. Especially after his promises of veggie happy meals, and a more conscious menu for Americans on the go.  Nigga please, take a walk with me on this slip-an-slide of Black America, some might call it Georgia Avenue.  Adolescent behavior is a rising problem in the black community. Basically these lil niggas think they grown. Well you are probablly wondering what ole McDonald has to do with it, it's quite simple my dear Dr. Ranchero. Ole McDonald has a farm and on his farm are steroid filled cows, chickens, soy, and even some lettuce with a hormonal boost.  All these steroids andhormone pumped products are in your McDonald's. Them bag fries pack a lil more punch than a couple extra calories.  The hormones in your McDonald's are showing up in a lack of training bra sales, and a rise in Victoria's Secret output.  Many a man have asked "just what is Vickie's Secret?", well I don't know what it was, but I know it is now Ole McDonald.  These hormones are rapidly developing preadolescent and adolescent bodies. Twelve and thirteen year olds look like sixteen year olds, oh and the sixteen year olds look legal.  These increased flesh-mounds speed up sexual activity among the black youth, thus resulting in more teenage pregnancy, which has been ripping thru the black community like a machete in jungle brush or a fart through a corduroy!  This advanced state of teenage pregnancy creates cycles of teenage pregancy creating a generation of 40 year old grandmas. This generation I like to call the "Number 1's with an Extra Hamburger" are rolling thru Black America in droves. These unguided youth are running around looking for something to feed their soul and make themselves feel happy. Now what diabolical man promises such things? So many black males looking for fast money, knocking niggas in the head for that fast money or an "Extra Value". Where can you find such things?  That Ole McDonald has a farm.  They ought to change that McDonald's song to "Pusherman":   I'm you momma,  I'm your daddy,  I'm that nigga with the drive-thru alley,  I'm your pusherman. Want some coke  want some cheese, for here or to go if you please, I'm your pusherman. You know me  I got toys, Pokemons for girls and boys, I'm your pusherman.  There you have it, the root of all evil, Ole McDonald himself. I'm not telling you not to eat there, but those too-tight underwear, and that squeaky chair, might be sending you a message.  So don't believe the death of the Super-Size will save you, because you have already paid your dues.  That large fry and a medium is the alternative root for you Brand New Heavies.    You might think you slick, but you will wind up big as St. Nick, because a 12 year old should never be thatthick around her "Rockies". Evil lurks, don't those arches look like horns?  Lucifer has a drive thru, and a clever way of words. Happy meals don't equal happy people, yeeeeeeeah yeaaaaaaah yeah yeah yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.      "Weekend Sports Recap" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.        This past weekend, sports fans and hopeful millionaires had an opportunity to strike it rich. "The Belmont Steaks", the final leg of the Ruff N Ready Triple Crown. This annual race of greatness took place Saturday with the favorite "Smarty Wallace", a brown pitbull from Potomac Gardens, poised and ready to claim the first Triple Crown in 20 some odd years.  The race was to be held off of Belmont St. in NW Washington, D.C., but was later moved to the Kenilworth Go-Kart Track because of better seating. The race began at a furious pace with "Smarty Wallace" and a pack of 8 other pitbull dogs. Among others favored to place and show in the race, "Bear" the 178 pound rotweiller out of 7th and Madison, "Birds and Stones" a scrawny underfed pitbull hailing from Chesapeake.  The race began about 3:50, standard go-kart time, with "Spiderman", a white pitbull from Temple Hills marked by a irritated case of glass-to-the-eye, creating a web-like scar, taking the early lead. "Spiderman" got a bit unfocused and began gnawing at tires on the racetrack. A German shepherd named "Sylvia" appearedto be in heat and had the other four entrants vying for a piece of her love.  This left "Birds and Stones" and "Smarty Wallace" to navigate the course. "Smarty" took a big lead rounding the course, but got a bit tuckered out as he narrowed the last 25 feet of track, and "Birds and Stones" walked him down and broke up "Smarty Wallace's" bid to win the Ruff N Ready Triple Crown.  Kyree, "Birds and Stones" trainer apologized for breaking up the bid for the elusive Triple Crown but gleefully accepted the renamed Boys and Girls Club Trophy, "The Dog on the Hill Cup" and walked away singing "Must Be Like That".

       "Attention Black Women" By Salvador Gabor    Yes ladies, it's your turn. You will not get off easily. Last week I spoke to the Black Men who read this site. Now I am speaking to my Black Women. I spoke to the men first because it is our responsibility to lead the Black Family through the storms of life. We are the protectors, providers and instructors. Women, you are the nurturers, caretakers and comforters. Along with those traits, women provide countless qualities that can not be grasped from a physical standpoint. Just your presence in the lives of others make such a difference. So today ladies, we need to talk   * The word "Diva". Ladies, is it that serious? Designer bags, hair appointments, manicures, pedicures and so on and so forth. Does it really make you a "DIVA"? This one is dedicated to the YOUNG women. The 18 year old female who feels that a purse makes her somebody. As my older relatives would say "Go somewhere and get some education about yaself!". Do something besides trying to look cute. In big cities across this country, there are young inner-city women who dress like Bo Derek but are living like Bo Diddley! You wear Prada, Louis Vuitton and all of these designer clothes but, your house is run-down. You share a room with your 2 cousins and you have 2 uncles that live in the basement. You work 3 jobs to get a few items to wear and when it's all said and done, you gain nothing. Absolutely NOTHING. If you wanna get fly, babes.......get fly but get some stocks and bonds in your life before you start talking about how much of a "Diva" you are.  * Abuse. Don't stand for it. If a man hits you, he's not for you. Period! If I gotta slap a woman, I'm not gonna be with her. If I have to punch a woman, I'm not gonna be with her. That's just how it is. A man who hits a woman is a man who feels he can no longer get his point across to you verbally. Either he feels that you are dumb as a brick or you are just not going to listen to him at all. Either way, respect has been lost. He has lost respect for you and you have lost respect for him. Now, with that being said, understand one thing.........there is no excuse for him hitting you but, that's not to say he may not have been provoked. BEFORE you take this the wrong way.............hear me out. I've seen this alot ladies. You get in an arguement with a man and begin to start calling him ALL kinds of names. Telling him what he WON'T and AINT do to you. How scared his is. Just totally disregarding his manhood altogether. If you don't talk to men in the street like that, don't talk to your "man" like that. PERIOD. Some of yall talk so sassy in the house and on the phone but, if one of them thug niggas approach you on the street and try to get that number, "you be scared as a mug". Respect yours just as you respect someone in the street.  * Drawing Pictures. I had a female tell me once........."I look at men like a painting. I take a lil of this man and paint him in the picture. I take some of this man and add him, then I take a portion of this man and sprinkle him in a bit". Those weren't her exact words but, to sum it up, she had this idea that she could take characteristics from each man she dealt with and make it into one "dream man". Ladies, wake up! This is not a "dream" so why are you asleep? If you are up, why are you daydreaming? Men like one thing in particular from women. We like to be told what's going on. We hate the hard truth but, we love it as well. If I'm the ugly guy that's just nice enough to bring around your parents, TELL ME. If I'm the guy you call because the guy that you want doesn't converse well over the phone, TELL ME. If I'm the guy who has my goals together and I'm the "husband type" but, you really like that other guy who wears bandana's and tank-tops, TELL ME. We are humans. You can't play "etch-a-sketch" with us. Don't make 5 men into 1 in your mind. If the guy that you are interested in does not have it all, then leave or accept his faults. Stop trying to deal with these guys that you feel are ugly but, you like him because he has a great job. Stop trying to deal with guys that you know are "geeky" yet, they are your personal "gophers" or "flunkies". I'm not saying they can't be great companions and spouses but, deep down you are only with them for a while.  * Co-existing. "I can't stand females....that's why I all my friends are males!". Most females say this to men thinking it's cute. Baby, slim, shorty, honey........that's not cute. AT ALL. As a matter of fact, that's a complete turn-off.  It's 2004, and we are all grown. If a woman looks at you wrong or "hates" on you, make her get on your level. Where no love is present, you show more love. Being "catty" is played out. Especially if you are above the age of 21. Women, yall have to be able to co-exist. Women networking together can be a powerful tool. There is no limit when women come together. And as BLACK Women, it is definitely important. Our young girls are running crazy right now. Someone needs to step in and put forth some effort into salvaging the situation.   * 3-day Work Week. I heard one woman say that she wants to marry a man who makes enough money so that she only has to work 3 days a week. When I first heard it, I thought it was an isolated comment. But over the last 5 years, I'm hearing MORE and MORE women saying this. Almost in the exact words as the first woman that I heard say it. I mean.......Did yall have a meeting to discuss this newly implemented work week? More importantly, did yall bother to ask us if we wanted 2 extra days off as well? You can't be independent, equal and respected by men if you all of a sudden wanna get "old-fashioned" and let US be the breadwinners. Yall always wanna be equal but, when it's time to put the air conditioner in the window it's always "Honey that thing is too big for me to help you carry". Yall always wanna be equal but, when that rat is in the basement, we gotta go down there. Shoot.....I'm scared of rats too. Point being.........you want to be equal......well equal is not having a 3-day work week! You betta stop depending on a man to bring in the money. I know a woman who has been married for decades and STILL keeps about $100-$200 in her pocket when her and her husband go outta town. She told me........"You NEVER know what could happen". In so many words, she's been married for years but, she never knows......... that nigga STILL might leave her down Georgia on I-95!     That's my time. Look forward to next week's edition of Sal's Corner. 6/14/04 happens to be my 25th Birthday. I will definitely have something special to say on that day. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

       LSE Success Tip Vol 6.18.04 By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    Be cognizant of what is in your backpack, whether it be books or bricks, make sure you use them to make you stronger, and don't be afraid to either out and bust someone over the head with some knowledge.   --Dr. Wakim Piedmont, Dean of Microfish, Fisk University--   A daily routine can result in much success, or lazy dreamers with lungs of cajun brown by afternoon cess.   Doubleheaders can be helpful and harmful, as long as you know how to set your schedule.  Who wants to play the Yankees twice a day, or go thru two-a-days with someone else's baby's mother on toilet-seat upkeep.  Why do this especially if "Passion" fixed breakfast and has rice-pudding and BBQ chicken for dinner.   Make "Notes to Self".  Realize that there are certain people whose sole goal is to zap your brain cells, with their trivial retoric, and up-close conversations smelling of Kools and Gin.  Make certain notes about your observations, and how to avoid Instigation and Rigormoro.   Definitely cooperate with "Inevitable".  As we have seen with Gus and his "cologne supplementing", funk can only hide behind cologne's tree, and it is a matter of time before the funk is spotted.   "Trifling" is a nasty nigga.  Please do not be seen in public with him or invite him over your house.  He is the type that takes his baby's momma's sister out for a stroll in the back of her Envoy, then will come over your house and leave his draws in your bathroom floor.   Always stay with your nigga "T. Best".  Best is a nigga who should stick with you at all times.  Siamese yourself with him.  "T. Best" aka The Best, should help you whether you are cutting grass, or writing a thesis.  Amazing that he is sometimes the nigga you forget to invite to the cookout.   Success can be measured in buckets or urine syphons, but know it is alright to spill Success on you, it won't hurt, but it will stain.       "Tough D" By Salvador Gabor    As a man, I love to win. I'm a competitor but I'm not obsessed with outdoing the next man. Although I am composed with my competitive skills, all in all winning is key. Winning in the classroom, the workplace, the playing field and most importantly........IN LIFE. Life is a hard sport to win. It's hard to win because what you see as being a "point" may not be a "point" for others. Some see religious and spiritual growth as winning in life. Some see monetary and financial growth as winning in life. Others see peace and happiness as a sign of winning. Whatever aspect of life gains you points in your personal game of life is determined by how you were raised, influential people in your life and your exposure. Two people, with two different goals, headed in two different directions can both win at life. That's the beauty of the world we live in.   There is one attribute to winning in life that every MALE shares. As men, we all want to hold up our "trophy". That "trophy" is a sign of us having a "championship" in life. What a sight it is to see a man and his "trophy". We put in hard work to win that "trophy". We celebrate the winning of a "trophy". Some of us light cigars, pop champagne and some may even cry. Some get down on their knees and just pray for getting through a tough season. "Trophies" mean alot to us as men. "Trophies" are golden. You get to write your name on the "trophy" and mark that on this day in history, you won the "championship". Isn't that "trophy" sitting so pretty in your den? You walk pass it everyday. You talk to it. You may even kiss her. (Notice the gender reference). See, the "trophy" is our wives. No matter what angle a man comes from in life, he looks at his wife as his pride and joy. Women we do not see you as simply an object. But, you are wanted SO much that we look at gaining your attention as we do winning. Every man wants a "trophy". He can hold her up as a sign that he has "made it". But sometimes, after winning the "trophy" the feeling wears off. You forget how hard it was to win the "championship". Sometimes you lose sight of the fact that you once won a "trophy". I believe any man can win a "trophy" but, can you keep it?   So I guess you guys are asking......"How do I keep a trophy?". It's simple....... "Tough D". You gotta be able to "D-Up". Play that "D". I'm not telling you that I FEEL that's the way to win but, the "trophies" speak for themselves.The dynasties of professional sports accomplished amazing feats by playing "Good D". Even if you keep the "trophy", if the "D" isn't played, the "trophy".......oh she aint happy. Not at all.   Fellas, learn how to play "Tough D". If you don't know, here's a quick lesson.  #1) Move your feet. Keep them feet moving. Mobility is key.  #2) Bend your knees. Get flexible.  #3) Use your hands. Don't stand there with your hands on your waist.  #4) Keep moving. You don't want a 3-second violation.  #5) No Zones in the Big League. I know the NBA brought back the Zone defense but, as a defender you can only play "D" on one person once you begin the hunt for the "trophy".  #6) No fouling. This is a contact sport but, it's not football. It's no need in hurting the person your "checking".  #7) You can't call time-outs. Only the offense can call time-outs. If you are playing "D", you gotta be ready to "play D", when the offense comes on the court and you don't stop until they are ready to stop.   Now you can't rely ALL on "D". You have to have an all-around game. You have to play offense as well. Always be unselfish and pass the ball. Take risks with your shots but, mostly take good shots. Get in good with the "referees" of life, so you can get the good calls. Display good teamwork and team continuity. And most of all have a love for the game. But fellas..........FELLAS........PLAY THAT "D"!     Attention: To all men who are husbands, in this game of life, "Defense Wins Championships".

       "Just a lil chase" By Salvador Gabor     ........."Hey mane.........add a lil coke to my drank if ya will!". We've all heard this. You might run into someone who drinks liquor. They think that they can handle the drink until that "drank" getz a lil too hot. Orange Juice, Coca-Cola, Lime, Cranberry Juice or other fruity or soda drinks are added to "chase" the situation. In life, we ALL love THE "chase" and TO "chase". "Chasing" money, "chasing" the opposite sex and "chasing" whatever else that we want, can't have and aint got yet.   What is it about that "chase"? I don't know myself. I think the most "chased" thing is happiness. And most people "chase" the opposite sex for this happiness. That ole "chase". It sure SEEMS fun. I've never drank any alcoholic beverages but, I feel that marriage is like a liquor, with no "chase". It can burn you up on the inside (if you can't handle it), make you lose your mind and wake up with headaches. And if the woman is pregnant, she might even throw up. So when that marriage gets to tough, we like to "chase". You see the married men at the cookouts.......STILL tryna hang close to the single men to check out the lil honies. Then Alberta screams your name out......"WESLEY! If you don't bring you "so and so" over here!". Thats a husband still "chasing". "Oh naw I just got her number cause I knew I could. I do it for the game, ya know!". Ok Wesley! Whatever you say Wesley.   How about the single people? Oh we love to "chase". We "chase" so much that it's no more liquor in the cup. It's just all orange juice and a pinch of gin. That "chase" makes you feel like you are tough. "Shoot, Willie pour a lil more Bacardi up in there. I need a lil more buzz!". You take away more and more "chase" and then that liquor HITS you hard. And most of the time, that sweet taste of all that "chase" makes you keep drinking. "Ooooh Geraldine, you need some of this, this party punch is the bomb!". The best "chase" come at parties, cookouts and celebrations. That's NOT just fruit punch you are drinking. If you are not careful, you will get "drunk". Waking up wit headaches, stank breath and not knowing how you got to where you are. And more importantly, wishing you hadn't drank so much.  Then, OH THEN when you go to those outing such as parties, cookouts and celebrations, it's always someone who wants to pour a lil more drank in your cup. "Come on now Jesse, I don't see no henny in that cup. I aint buy these can sodas from Bi-Lo for you to be dranking em all up now. Hit this bottle wit me". See.........they are DRUNK. Remy ......STRAIGHT. And like any nigga, when they are "on their head" or have "jumped ALL the way IN the bottle" they want you to be drunk right with them. Man up and let them know you need a lil more cranberry in your vodka. You aint ready to stop the "chase" just yet.  The "chase". It's simply the idea that when you are in public, you have your eyes on radar for who and what you want. THEN you find your target. The "chase" has vanished and now you are stuck with a tall cup of liquor called "relationship". This aint no average drink. No way buddy. This one will and shall burn that chest and give you a headache. You can't even drive home. This is because the worst arguements happen in the car! You are drunk off that "relationship". But, don't blame me. Blame your love for playing "chug-a-lug". Just remember, if you not ready to get rid of the "chase" and step it up to the straight shots, keep the "chase" going. But, if you "chase" too much, you maybe fooled into thinking that you are bigger than the "chase". A cup full of "relationship" will surely have you on your head fo' sho'!

       "The Unheard Voice" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    There are things that go bump in the night, some things causing all kinds of fright many causing a disgusted reaction and much dislike. Some call this the Unheard Voice.   Is this Unheard Voice something created by force or choice,  a reaction delayed or a shout released  A view of politics and society  or a movement released?  An unforeseen prophesy  or a reaction to something deceased?  An factual conclusion on the lack of minority owned property,  or a pant-leg uncreased?   Just what is this Unheard Voice?  A diabolical comment on social temperment,  or some residual leftover from an earlier supplement?  A lockerroom statement inspiring the Patriots post halftime acheivement,  or preponderence of evidence causing post-nasal bereavement?   The Unheard Voice causes many reactions  sometimes shedding light on neglect,  and bringing about social satisfaction.  This Unheard Voice can create an uproar,  have 5 to 10 people moved to up and roar.   "Man what is that, did you do that?"  The Unheard Voice can create dissention over a hidden fact,  that this powerful voice can be nothing more than hot air released intact.  This Unheard Voice, this disemboweled franchise  can bring water to your nose and tears to your eyes.  This Unheard Voice can rip like unchained thunder,  or create a mud-like blunder.  So be careful where you release your "Unheard Voice",  For it may hold more water than you think,  and might move people more than 2hours of free drinks.  Aint nothing good about Happy Hour,  preceeded by 3-bean chilli and a lack of bowel-power.          A Nation in Mourning By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      Today a nation mourns the loss of an innovator, a great leader, an actor, and an overall good man. Last week the Nation of Bridge, Spades, and Rummy Players lost a former president. President Ron-Ray Putnam lost a 17 year bout with the gout on last Saturday.  President Ron-Ray a man of power throughout the BCC, Black Cards Circuit, had been a champion to all, and was an 11 time Player of the year in Gin-rummy, and was part of the 20-time tag team champions in Spades and Bridge.  he retired from the Black Cards Circuit in 1993, and served as President of the Nation of Bridge, Spades, and Rummy Players.   Putnam played a major part in tournament scheduling. Many times Bridge tournaments overlap, the 11pm Saturday start date for Spades playing nigga-nationwide. He scheduled more Bridge tourneys during the week to alot time on Fridays and Saturdays for Spades and Rummy. He also changed the size of card tables, making standard size of tables 6 feet around. This prohibited "low-signaling" from many of the longer-legged ladies, especially Ms. Truly Spence who would often kick and nudge her partner Ophelia "Opho or Phelia" Henson to victory in both Spades and Bridge. Putnam put an end to this when he and his partner Gus "Tweeder" Black, ran into Truly and "Opho" in the 1987 Spades Tourney down at Jarvis' Ballroom. Ron-Ray learned Truly's signature nudges and misnudged Opho on several occasions costing them the game, 543 to 176.   Putnam's body will arrive at Latney's Funeral Home, and his casket once prepared by Harry "Sweet N Low" Wilson and Harry "Hammer" Thomas will arrive at 2 something on today.  Putnam's body will be driven everywhere that aint blocked off in Washington DC.  These are some of the sites where the hearse will be featured, some of his old stomping grounds.  U Street, 15th and V Sts., behind the Shrimp Boat, Nannie Helen Burroughs, and MLK to Malcolm X. A pair of Putnam's Rockports will be placed on the back of the family car facing backwards to show all of his defeated opponents his hand one last time.   The body will be set outside the church for 45mins so that anybody who couldn't take off can drive by and pay their respects. The body will then be taken inside for the wake and funeral. The funeral is by invite-only, and balcony seating is available.  Putnam is survived by his wife Shelly, his children Ron-Ray Jr., Lester, Butch, Roy, and Laree, an outside child named Larry Boodie, his partner of 37 years Gus, 7 or 16 grandkids (paternity suits pending) and a host of family, friends, and card players along the way.  The Boog-a-Loo's of 1st & O will render the music at the repass.

       Sal's Corner 6/14/79    25. 25 years! 25 years old! Man O Man. Its funny that my birthday falls on a Monday. Monday is "Sal's Corner" and on this Monday, I gotta lot to say. So light a candle, play something melodic as I go down memory lane a lil bit. As I turn 25 today, I look back and ask questions to myself. What am I doing with myself? Am I happy? What's next? and MOST important, What have I learned in 25 years???? Let's deal with that last question in particular. What HAVE I learned in 25 years?   * Nobody is gonna do you like YOU do you - Real talk playa. Example: You need a ride from the bus stop/train station. Its cold outside. Your house is up the street but your friend can easily come pick you up. 10 minutes TOPS. This is including, him/her putting on their shoes, finding keys AND driving to the station. What time does your friend end up getting there? About 20-30 minutes after you called!!! Thats just ONE example but my point is, nobody cares about your affairs like YOU do.  * You cant have nothing in the bed but a dream - My father told me that once. I'll NEVER forget it. The early bird gets the worm. If you get up at 12:00 P.M., it'll take you 6 hours to do what you could do in 3 hours if you got up at 7:00 A.M.   * LOOKS DO COUNT - Dont EVER let someone say they dont. Thats NONSENSE and dont believe it. Never judge a book by its cover, but if the cover aint good looking, you'll never pick up the book. Remember one thing, the easiest thing to change is your insides. That could be your attitude, your personality, your morals and beliefs. With effort, you can be a better person. No matter how many religions, phases or personalities you have, you are always gonna be the same person on the outside. I am a lightskin African-American male, usually keep a trimmed beard, low hair cut, so on and so on. Right now almost every person reading this article that knows me has somewhat of a different perception of me. YET, they all will describe me the SAME from a physical standpoint. But to 10 different people, I can be 10 different people. This girl might say "he's the sweetest guy". Shorty over there might say "That nigga aint worth 2 cents". This guy might say "He's a real dude". My man over there might say "I cant stand the dude". Its like this.......Straight up.......Im gonna marry a cute woman!!!! You may laugh now but if you see me wit a DUCK, point me out. Let me know "Sal why are you out in public with this duck??" thats right, im gonna marry a cute woman and if she aint perfect, we can work on that cause Im not perfect either. We just gonna be 2 imperfect, working to be perfect people. Now she maybe cute to ME and not to yall but, at least I'M gonna find her attractive. All yall that wanna date people 'cause they are "Financially Stable", they have a "good career" and they are "so NICE"........ remember this........you dont wake up to that checkbook, career or personality that your spouse has. When you look next to you in the morning that cute one is gonna look like that "Duck" looks AFTER they done showered and got dressed! Im serious. Ladies, dont marry me if you not attracted to me!!! Im dead serious. Cause when you marry someone who you are not attracted to for real, the first thing they do that you dont like..........you getz em outta there! Cause if they not gonna be nice, WHAT ARE THEY THERE FOR?????    Note:  Some of what I'm saying is a joke but, seriously the moral of the story is not to settle. When it comes to a relationship, go for what you want and not what's available. If it's not there at this point, dont throw in your hand. When it comes to work or representing yourself, take care of yourself. Always present yourself in a good fashion. Sometimes people think that their work is all that matters. But alot of the time, no one will recognize your talents if you don't take some time out and begin to work on your physical presentation. Put that suit on or throw on some cologne or iron that shirt. Because in the end, looks do matter.  * There's no such thing as a "Nice Person" or a "bad person" - That person isn't nasty....... YOU JUST LET THEM TALK FUNKY TO YOU. To someone else they are the sweetest person. If you find yourself in a situation where its ALWAYS you being dogged, look in the mirror.   * Being nice gets you places that money cant take you - My mother said that to me along time ago. And it always proves to be right. Example: You might be at an event. The event maybe $50 to get in. Its a crowd outside and no one can get in. You may have $1,000,000 (A MIYON DOLLAS) in your pockets, but if you talk nasty to the person taking money, you might be outside ALL NIGHT. On the other hand, you might not have NO money. You could walk up and STILL walk right in and Ive seen it happen!!!!!  * Nobody wants to hear your problems - First, let me say life is like this.........1)You're going through a problem and cant deal with someone elses, 2) Your problem is alot BIGGER than the problem someone is bringing to you, 3) Your problem aint HALF as bad as that problem being brought to you or 4) You've been there done that and you cant see why they are tripping off of that problem. My suggestion: dont tell your problems to ANY OLE BODY. Tell it to someone who can and is known for providing good answers. That person is BOUND to fall under the 4 categories so they may brush off your problem but, at least they can give you a good option  * Dont let the opposite sex run your life - Here's a joke. A Dog is walking slowly across a train track. While walking across, a train approaches. The Dog is STILL mozying on along. The dog thinks he can make it without being hit. So he is getting off the track as the train nears. Its a close call. The Dog is ALMOST off the tracks BUT..........the train rips off his tail. The dog goes BACK on the tracks to get his tail. As he does, a train coming from the opposite way floats pass and knocks his head off. MORAL: NEVER LOSE YOUR HEAD FOR A PIECE OF TAIL.   * (For the Men) Women dont want your money - NO, they really dont. Women like the attention that money can bring. Money just happens to be an avenue that can lead to drawing major attention. No woman wants a man that no other woman wanted. And when a man is wanted, the attention is drawn. Women like to put their stamp on a man. So whether you are an athlete, businessman or the neighborhood superstar, that woman knows that despite all of your success, she can add something to you that imprints her stamp on you.   * (For the Women). Meekness is NOT Weakness. Women want strong men. I can respect that. Just understand what it is that you really want. Just because he picks the dates and he calls the shots dont make him strong. You know what MEEK means? A meek person knows they can beat you and that they are stronger than you, but they look out on your behalf. He might let you pick the place cause its your day. Maybe it doesnt MATTER where you and him go, as long as he is around you. And just because he doesn't know if he wants chicken or fish tonight does not make him a weak man either. He JUST MIGHT NOT know if he wants chicken or fish on that day! It's not that serious! Ive seen many women who like the outspoken, assertive and aggressive men and they consider that "Strong". Sometimes outspoken, assertive, and aggressive men are JUST LOUD, DUMB and WRONG. If I let you make the decision its only because I trust your judgment, I respect your opinion and we see eye to eye. IF and IF I dont agree......THEN you will see and hear me step forward with my opinion. See ladies, what you see as a "Strong" man sometimes can AND will be irritating 20 years after you've gotten married. I know older women who cant even SAY A WORD to their "Strong" husbands. Men making the decision whether you like it or not. Whether its GOOD or not. As a wife, you help your husband, but alot of these guys who you LOVE for their so- called "strength" aint gonna even let you talk 20 years from now.  and this biggest thing I've learned is.........  * You need people - Never stray away from people. Never close yourself from those who love you. It's good to get away to clear your head but, in this battle of life, it's not all about you. What you see as being "second-nature" maybe be a blessing for someone else. You may not think that you matter but, you do. Most of the people that you see talking to themselves downtown on a corner are those who thought they knew it all. They probably had no support group and they tried to figure it ALL out on their own. We know nothing. We really don't know anything. And when we figure that out and just take each day for what it's worth, we will be alot better off.    After my first 25 years, I can say that I've been blessed. I thank Jesus Christ for keeping me after all this time. I've been in a few situations where I could have literally died but, there is something out here for me to do so, he has kept me. I have friends that have died, doing serious jailtime or stuck in serious situations so I'm always thankful. As always "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

      "Sports Update" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   The end of June is rapidly approaching and while basketball season has ended and football season waits in the wings, "slap-boxing" and "going-to-the-body" are in full swing. In many alleys, and under many streetlights across urban neighborhoods throughout the nation, these sports are picking up and here are some of the highlights.   In the LA County Boys Club 65-pound Slap Box Division Ricardo Bey won the Jr. meet with a slapdown of Angel Gonzalez.  He 2-pieced Angel to the face and gave him a cupped left-handed slap to the temple, causing immediate tearing and an insuing headache. Ricardo also won a $35 credit to In&Out.   Last week in Detroit following the Piston's parade, their was a "Go Back-2-Back Go-to-the-Body Contest" sponsored by Rasheed Wallace and Corliss Williamson. This event surely got Detroit's competitve alley-boxing circuit in full swing. The bouts began with celebrity photos with Rasheed, Corliss, Ben Wallace, Tommy Hearns, and MLK High School "Go-to-the-Body Champion 1978-1985" Curtis Wayne. The first bout showcased Wayne's nephew Dontonio as he fought against Levi Clement. Clement up and hit Dontonio in the face which was a major mistake. Clement, a portly fellow standing 5'9" and weighing 270 lbs, stole Dontiono in the neck/jaw. Dontonio kept his composure and landed a sure right-hand to Levi's sternum. Levi a chronic asthmatic fell to his fat knee and grabbed his chest. He laid down for a ten-count, and was later given his inhaler by his aunt Sylvia. Two pipeheads later squared off, this bout instigated by Rasheed, lasted for a good 2 minutes. Sir Francis Dooley knocked out Tim-Tom Walls after punching him in the underarm, which caused Tim-Tom to hit his head on the side of the neighboring rib shack concussing him to say the least.   Other cities enjoying good urban street-boxing were Durham, NC, Decatur, GA, Philadelphia PA, and Washington, DC.  For more info on the citywide circuits check out www.ebonyslapboxing.com and www.ebonygo2thebody.com.  To reserve a crate in this year's regional finals in Memphis and or Port Arthur please call 1-800-CRATE-ME.        We had a few requests for the D.C. summer league results to be posted on here so......     "Berry Farms Goodman League Report" (6/23/04) By Salvador Gabor   In Game 1 of the doubleheader yesterday, "All Purpose Gear" defeated "Air Lorton" in overtime. In Game 2, "Shooters Sports" led by "Trouble" Curt Smith defeated "Nardy Nard's Mob" 53-49.       "Master's Degree" By Salvador Gabor    Everyone is trying to go back for their "Master's". "Girl, I told Nylah the other day, she needs to go ahead and get her degree cause I'm gonna go on ahead and get my master's!". A "Master's Degree".........what is it? Some see it as a "meal ticket". Others see it as a challenge that they can overcome. Some see it as being a bragging tool. Then there are some who may need it to go out and do a job that helps others.   "Master's Degree". It's only two words but, the phrase can lead you into so many other realms. How about the word "Master"? A "master" is a dominant figure that leads and controls the lives of others. A "master" gives instructions and expects immediate responses and results. To actually "master" something is to conquer it. Say it with me........"MASTER!". It sounds so powerful doesn't it.  How about the word "Degree". "Degree" is equivalent to a level of severity or acheivement. Whether it be the temperature, education or amount of arm deodorant, we all deal with "Degrees". So I assume if you put the words "Master" and "Degree" together, you'd probably be describing a situation where a dominant figure has conquered his goal or obstacle to the highest level.   Well I am here to say that many of you are gaining your "Master's Degree" each day. That man who works on the sanitation team but, doesn't get to ride IN the truck, only on the back to hop off every 2 minutes to get the garbage pail...........he could be getting his "Master's Degree". That lady who is a nurse and is always is the first to be asked to come into work when Glenda couldn't make it 'cause "her house burnt down for the 3rd time this month"......oh that lady is working on her "Master's Degree". What about that rapper who says "Let's keep hip hop alive".......he already got his "Master's Degree". And last but not least........that lady who thinks she is gonna quit her 9 to 5 to go sell Mary Kay and escape "the man" is getting her "Master's Degree".  See every "Master's Degree" aint a PhD. You are just working for your "master" to the highest "degree". That man who rides on the back of the trash truck is a good man. But, he must remember that he is no slave. Let not one man treat you like trash JUST because you pick up trash. Don't fall into a "slave mentality". All that profanity and lack of up-keep is unnecessary. Trash men get shape-ups. Trash men wear belts. Trash men can speak correct english. Don't fall a victim of   getting your "master's degree". See Glenda aint getting her "Master's Degree". Even though she is wrong for not doing her job, she is gonna call in when she wanna call in. But that old lady nurse keeps on breaking her sleep to go in and cover for Glenda. But, you never know, that same old lady maybe be ready to strike when her benefits aren't increased. How about that rapper.........oh he wants to keep hip-hop alive. Entertainers come and go. When you aren't selling a million records, is hip hop gonna feed Lil Boo-Boo and your daugther Tyesha. The industry aint gonna remember you. You betta get the most out of IT!. How about Mrs. Mary Kay........well she thinks that she has it good. Not quite yet. Slow your horses. Yes, you have left the work force for "your own business". But, so many people are doing that until the "non work force" is NOW the WORK FORCE. You didn't wanna work for the Department of Justice but, you don't mind working for Mary Kay...........YET they tell you it's you OWN business. Does it say "Elsie McBride's Products"? NO, so it aint your business. It's STILL Mary Kay's. All you did is just change "Master's".  At the end of the day, we all have to work. Whether you have an office job, pick up trash, sell Katydids or Roast Pig Feet at a BBQ Shack all day..........work for YOURSELF. You can work at a job and STILL work for yourself. You can have "your own business" and NOT be working for yourself. Dedicate yourself to the people who are dedicating themselves to you. That job will find another employee. The company won't shut down because you are gone. You have to be able to depend on self. Not some degree..........especially a "Master's Degree".   "Dont put your eggs in one batch and when buying a fish sandwich, sometimes 2 slices of bread aint enough"    -Lavell Crumpton- (An excerpt from his speech "When Two Quarters Are Rubbed Together")

       "Relationships...You Gotta Have a Nose for Them" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    The time has come and many of us are in our mid to late twenties. Older relatives like to ask questions like "you got you a lil girlfriend?", "Where's your man at?", "when y'all getting married?", "she's such a nice girl!". Don't let these questions pressure you. Pressure is only as strong as you let him be. Squeeze ole "Pressure" and he will stop squeezing you. He is relentless when it comes to relationships, but sometimes you got to knock "Pressure" down and put your foot on him neck.   More often than not, females feel the pressure to be married by a certain age. They like to think that they have it all mapped out. Married by 26, kids by 28, not selling Mary Kay by 33. They tend to have a lot of things to do and places to be without serious means of accomplishing either. They want to get a man to settle down so they can set a pace to accomplish these things. However, what many people fail to realize is that oftentimes settling down means settling for less. Males oftentimes feel pressured to do certain things by a certain time. Now sometimes this timeframe is self-induced but, most times it is scheduled, and managed with a pit-bull grip by their woman. Men feel pressured to stop drinking and smoking so much, and stop playing Playstation with Keith and Dewey.   These timeframes are sometimes good but, sometimes bad as well. Many times, the woman feels like if he won't conform to these new found standards then she should move on, and settle down. Here comes the settling for less. You got this guy who will do what you say, and is alright, but you really don't like him as much as Vincent. You have just settled for less. Fellas, you really could stop smoking around the kids but, now you got with a mild-hoodrat who doesn't mind your smoking, shoot she even smokes too. Hint hint, brotha you have just settled for less. Don't think that it is ok because y'all can get criminal whenever you want. "Don't look a gift booger in the mouth.", a quote by Jameson Pitts. Don't look any booger in the mouth, one on the tooth is surely worth two on the lip. Do you want everyone to see you with that booger? If you find her smoking more than you even want to, and find yourself wondering, "dang how much money is she spending on bud?", oh this is a major sign of booger. Now you are Bud-wiser, and realize Denise had a point.   Settle up, get married because it is right, not because your girlfriend says you should be married by 26. Have your child because she is a good woman and a fit mother, not because your mother is pressing you for grandkids. Settle up, not down. Settling down sounds like a permanent state of oppression. Keep going up til your head hits the ceiling, then pool your money together and buy anew, if your head keeps hitting the ceiling buy something with a retractable roof. Keep your head to the sky, and take your lady with you, but keep a pair of boots on, their is broken glass, and dog mess on the ground.    "For every girl with table manners, there are boogers in a napkin, just keep those boogers in the napkin and not on your lip."

       "All Aboard" By Salvador Gabor   "Transportation". What is it? Simply put, "transportation" is the means by which we get from our current location to our ultimate destination. You can look at life as a game, a joke or a serious matter but, no matter your angle, you will "travel" in this life we live in. How will you travel? Through various means of "transportation". You can travel by plane, train, automobiles or even those rockports that you wore to work to match your khaki pants. All of these means of "transportation" can get you to where you need to be. Now, of course a plane is faster than a train. A train is faster than a car. And a car is faster than walking. And if you're walking, you may have some serious "corn fields" growing in your shoes if you walk long enough. Needless to say, we all have different destinations and we all use different means.  Planes. What a joy it is to be able to get across the world in a matter of hours. A plane is the fastest means of transportation that the public is exposed to. Whether it be a private plane, jet, or mainstream airliner, we can use planes to get to where we wanna go VERY fast. You get to lay back in a nice chair and have a stewardess serve you food and drinks throughout the ride. Planes provide you with magazines, headphones and movies to entertain you while you fly. It's a great feeling to be treated this way. But, there are a few setbacks with planes. With a plane, we can't up and go when we want to. There is a schedule that the airline has laid out. Many times, there are delays in schedule. If the weather is inclimate, you may not be able to travel. It takes a long time to board a plane due to terrorist precautions. A plane can be fast but, you are never on your own time when dealing with planes.   Trains. A train is almost as good as a plane. The only difference is the train is a little slower. But with a train, you get to ride across a large piece of land and see the beautiful landscape of a country. You are served just as you would be on a plane. What's better about the train is that you can actually have a bed to sleep on if you get tired depending on the length of the trip. The main setbacks with trains are similar to planes. On a train, you have to wait on their schedule and there are major precautions that are taken.  Car. It's nothing like a road trip. We can load up the trunk and the back seat, pack our lunches, grab our favorite CD's and make as much noise and have as much fun as we want to. You don't have to act all sophisticated like you are on a train or plane. You don't even have to be clean to travel in your car. You can keep your rollers in your hair ladies. Men, you can wear the holey t-shirt and the dirty looking jeans. Kids, you can scream in the back seat. But, as with any other means of transportation, a car has its setbacks. It takes "YEARS" to get across the country, where a plane or train takes a much shorter time. When driving, you have to take different highways. There are no highways in the sky or on the tracks. You can take a straight shot on a plane or train. But, with a car, you may exit off of 3, 4 or even 5 highways before you get to your destination.   Walking. We don't like to walk now do we? We won't even walk to the store. We feel as though we HAVE to drive. Well that's for some of us. There are some that will be willing to walk. Then they get halfway out of the house and decide to try to catch a ride. You maybe walking only hoping to see someone you know driving along. You are secretly hitchhiking and no one knows it. "Any other day Rodney comes thru here. Now of ALL days, I don't see ole Rodney!". Why did you decide to walk? Why did you miss your intended ride? Why are your shoes creasing in the front? All of these are questions you may and should ask yourself when walking far.  After all of these paragraphs, you have to be wondering "WHAT is he talking about?". Well go back to the top. Life is full of travels. And how do we travel? Through various means of transportation. Everyone wants to make it to the top. So it takes traveling very far to get to where we want to be. Being successful is not a short journey. So what means of transportation or YOU using to get there? Could it be a plane? Well planes are in the air flying. That's the fast way to success. Many athletes, entertainers and lottery winners take this route. They fly to the top. One day they're broke and the next day they are rich. On a plane you can be in another time zone in a matter of minutes. This is the fastest way indeed. Some of us take the train. A train is a straight driven shot to where you need to be. Most college students take this route. You pick a major and you stick with that major. You don't get off "track". You are "trained" to go in one direction. You can sleep comfortable at night because you are where you feel you need to be. You didn't fly but, you aren't moping around moving slow either. How about driving? MOST of us are drivers. There are more cars on the street traveling than there are planes in the air or trains or tracks. Most of us could fly or ride the train but we strayed away from that. Somewhere down there line, we didn't book that flight in time or we didn't buy that train ticket. So, now we have to be driven. Most of us have to be "driven" to make it to our destination. But, are you driving to a short destination or a far destination. If you really wanna go far, you have to exit off of different highways. You can get to L.A. from D.C. by JUST using I-95!!!! You gotta take several highways. You might stay on this road for a while, exit off to another road, go north for a while, go west for a while and eventually you'll get there. As long as you've mapped out the trip, you will get there. Don't ride by yourself. You need people to help you with the map and people to talk to all the way. But, are any of us walking? Don't be a hitchhiker waiting on someone to pick you up. You'll look very stupid. Find a means of transportation that will save some life on your Sambas.   So you have your choices. You can fly, that's IF you can find a ticket and if you are willing to wait on a plane and it's schedule. You can catch the train if you can be patient enough to ride the same track all the way. You make your own time when driving but, you will have several highways to pass and their maybe many stops. Or you can walk a lil bit, wait on the sidewalk for someone to feel sorry for you and pick you up?      "Emotion Airlines"  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      It is summertime and people want to go on trips. Some trips are business trips, others are family vacations, and others are the getaway with a new special someone. Many people want to fly to Miami or Cancun, or to the Solomon Islands, or even go to the exotic Poconos (well the Poconos aint exotic at all.  I used to think it was some warm island something like Hawaii or the Bahamas, even though it is some mountain range in Pennsylvania.  Stay tuned for more on this)   Make sure you find out all background information prior to taking your trip. Make travel and hotel reservations, check proximities to and fro planned destinations and whether or not a rental car is needed, check and make sure your companion has spending money, and no warrants. You would hate to fly all the way down New Orleans and find out Raynard has a warrant from '85.   I have always heard "don't take more than you plan to carry". With this being said, before you take your "voyage de verano" leave all that baggage behind. Their is no baggage department on Emotion Airlines. If you can't hand-carry your stuff, you have too much stuff. Don't expect Raynard to help you with those 3 big things of stuff, if y'all aint gonna be there that long. Stop dragging all that stuff. You got your bag of shoes, bag of makeup, bag of beach clothes, and a couple of suit bags. Needless to say, you got too much stuff. Look at your companion he has all his stuff in that big black bag. It aint filled to the zipper, and he has room to take on some of your stuff if needed.  However don't bog Raynard down with your stuff, claim your own baggage.   Alot of y'all still got baggage from your first trip to the Poconos back in '96, when you and Tiffany went with Dewey and Keith. Stop dragging all that baggage, that big bag won't fit on top of the overhead compartment. Open up them bags and take that stuff out, throw it away, take it to the Goodwill, but don't leave it on your bed, because it will just wind up on the floor, and then back in your closet, only to packed again, on your next trip to Virginia Beach. Throw those things that don't fit out. Don't keep many of those things you have outgrown. If you are too big, or too old to wear those things throw them out. At "Emotion Airlines", you don't bring baggage, you just go with who you brought. So if you are about to leave for your trip to Atlantic City and Barry has 3 bags in the living room, one he is struggling down the steps with, and 2 small ones in the car. Not to mention you got 4 of your own, and yall are thinking about taking two cars to the airport, you 2 need not go. You two have two much stuff with you, not to mention Emotion Airlines ain't taking you nowhere that you can get by car in 3 hours. No point in a voyage when you going "down the road".

       Sal's Corner "Friends"         "How many of us have them?" "A friend you can depend on". I got an email from a GOOD friend of mines the other day and it was a FWD email about being friends forever. Real simple, ideal forward that we pass around SO much that you see your own name on the history of the email. But anyway, along with the attachment was a message from that friend. It was heart-felt and sincere and I can respect that. I wont get into what was said in the message but it was a nice letter. But I began to think about my "Friends". No, dont think Sallimo is about to get sentimental. I just wanted to break down "friends" for yall. We all have all kinds of friends but when you look at it, we all have the same kinda friends. Lets talk about em, shall we?    *The "Never in the house" friend - This friend is hard to find. I mean HARD. You got the boyfriend/girlfriend's house number. You got the grandmother's number. You even got numbers for the OTHER people he/she be wit (Sidebar: Cause every friend has another clique). All this and if the game starts at 7:30, you cant find him till 7:18.   * The "Never go nowhere" Friend. Talk a GREAT game but when the gravy hits the rice, they are in the house. You call em and tell em about something going on and they will get YOU hype. So hype that you're ready to go! I mean you called them to convince them and they RE-CONVINCED you. Brought up all kinds of good reasons why "WE" should go. Call em back when you on your way "naw I aint foolin wit it". Now I aint gonna lie........This is ME all the way. Im the "get hype" man. I will get you hype! But call me and say you 'bout to get ready and see what happens. I told one of my friends "Lets go to NY, like RIGHT NOW". He got hyped! I mean HYPED. He called "wifey and let her know he was gone. Called moms and dad "If you dont hear from me...Im in NY". He called like 15 people in 15 minutes before I could call him back just to say "You know what.....I aint even going"   Sidebar: When somebody say "You know what?...." with that pause, its NOT Good.   * The "Lets Go somewhere" friend: This is that friend that makes WAY more money than you, has more lee-way on his/her job or just dont care about how much money yall spend on when yall come in the house. They'll will have you like "Man dont you know I gotta work tomorrow???". They'll have you out at 3:00 A.M. over their house watching "Menace II Society". The whole time, you KNOW you gotta usher at church tomorrow. You'll be passing them bulletins out wit your eyes RED as koolaid.   * The "We gotta get up" friend. Now this is your real good friend. I mean a GOOD friend. Yall kick it and chill but its NEVER anywhere BUT the phone. You just cant find the time to get up with them but you enjoy your phone time with them. I got PLENTY of friends I aint SEEN in God knows when but we talk like EVERYDAY.   *  The "Old Times" friend: This nigga still think yall in High School. Still doing that same ole dumb stuff. Man I am NOT riding wit you in that UUV. For those who dont have criminal-minded friends like I do, UUV stands for Unauthorized Use of a Vehicle. After picking him up from the precinct enough times you'll get to know the police lingo.   * The "Like we never left" friend: He/She is like the "Old Times" friend except not as wild. He/She is funny and yall aint seen each other in 3 years but the sight of 'em by itself makes you laugh. Yall can get back together and its all of a sudden 1995 again.    * The "same old joke" friend: Maybe its just me but, have you ever had a friend that you shared ONE joke with and yall friendship lasts like 15 years off that ONE joke? I see people now and I cant figure out how 1 joke made us friends. Yall mighta seen someone fall and laughed together. You aint even KNOW his/her name but after that yall just kept speaking.   " The "what is his name?" friend: See im a real particular about not hurting peoples feelings. Im great with faces yall.......I really am but, some of yall be speaking to me and I dont know your names. I mean we REALLY cool. You ask me "how such and such doing?", "Did you ever finish this and that?" and I think to myself like "He know alot about me, but what is HIS name?" It's people out here that I rap to EVERYDAY and I never stop to say "Homie, what IS your name?" I dont know about yall but I KNOW when someone doesnt know my name. I have a unique name so its hit or miss. If your name is Dionte but, I'm not sure if it is....... I might could say Dion or Leon REAL low and fast and make Dionte think that I actually said Dionte. But Low and behold..... The truth comes out. Let another person walk in the room. "Hey James this is uhhh................well yall go on and introduce yall selves."    " The "Broke" friend: We all have one of those. Either one steady friend like this or people in your crew take turns being this one. I mean...... DAG, you coulda told me you aint have no money before we got up to the FRONT of the line. Were you hoarse in the car on the way up here? You can be broke, just let me know off the top. But see the broke dude is scared to say he's broke cause he will be put in that "dont answer his calls" category. Or the "I cant just take $15 cause Jimmy is going wit us" category. Whats worse is the "We will need separate checks Ma'am" category cause "broke dude" is always tryna sneak out of Ruby Tuesday's.    So there we have it. I know your friends fit in somewhere amongst these types. The most important thing is that we all express our love for our friends, despite their faults. One day you're here and tomorrow, you maybe gone. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"       "The Underworld that is Metro" Part 2  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      Public transportation is an interesting place. It is a realm all its own, with a combination of many different types of people forcibly meshed onto a car, bus or ferry.  A tricky place to say the least but, remember that there are rules in the belly of this beast.   More often than not ,folks are tired when entering the "Underworld". Whether it is early in the morning or in the afternoon, sometimes you just aren't quite ready for the ride.  Please stay awake for goodness sake, stand up if you have you must.   Women do not sleep on the train, it isn't cute. It aint like when your momma checks in on you as a youth, and they say "look at that sleeping angel". Matter of fact it, is far from it. You look uncomfortable, laid back neck looks bound to have a crick in it by the time you get to Van Ness. Your mouth is open, nothing is peaceful about this, your beauty can't save you from it. You could just miss your stop, as you get some mild hibernation looking like the grizzly bear that you hide from society.   Rollers:  There are people, some with justifiable reasons, and others just to lazy to carry their own bags.  Either way these roll-away bags are the worst.  Pick them up and carry them. I am tired of dodging these bags, like a Vietnam vet having flashbacks of landmines dancing in a pit of squirrels. You lazy, trying to look important people pick those bags up.   Post Office workers ride the train, and despite the stories of them being pyscho and all out ignorant people, they are relatively harmless on the train. They appear as regular working people. If you catch them out of their uniforms you might not know they are postal workers. However, all it takes is one Postal worker to spot another and it all comes out. The one not in uniform gets baited into talk of how much back-stabbing goes on at the Post Office. Questions like "You know ole Bates retired?", "Man, you know Tommy Gibbs got fired, Again?", "How much more time you got til you retire?", "Where do you see the future of the Post Office?". The future of the Post Office??? Man what do they think they will be doing? Hand carrying emails or get to wear all black when delivering Blackberry messages!?!?!?! Get next to two postal workers on the train, one might even be retired, that makes it even better.  Note: Postal workers tend to speak in civilized profanity, very much different than employees at the Library of Congress.

       LSE Success Tip Vol. 7.02.04  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       "Don't forget those who may have forgotten you, then you can recollect both sides of the Gemini.  A double-edged sword has a handle in the middle, it is from there that you can control both sides of the Gemini"  --Kingman Wyms 4th Degree Yellow Belt, "Kevin's Karate"--    Good relationships can turn your stack of 10s into a stack of 20s and those 20s into 50s.   Don't criticize the critical. Hookers hook, and pimps pimp, and unless their is pandering going on, continue to be a good worker.   When you say "thank you" mean it. Faye didn't have to go to the bread bank for you, nor did she have to bring you those yams that were on sale. A "Preciate you" goes along way.   A keen interest can be good, just don't engulf yourself in that guy on the train.  Darshay he might only be looking at you because you aint got them ankles locked, Friday pannies are to be worn on Friday not Thursday. You can't plan for the future with your draws.   Smile when smiled unto. Being stuck-up might get you stuck-up. I'm not saying Keith and Dewey would hurt a lady, but they know niggas who would.   Listening can be a road map to ignorance. If you listen you will know what twists and turns down Conversation Blvd. will take you to Dont-Be-Bothered-With-Her Ave. and that Hoodrat Terrace is a cul-de-sac, and that relocation expenses won't be repaid when going across the Gold-Digger Bridge.   Making others feel important can be a hard thing to do, especially if they are short with your money.  Rico down the gas station wouldn't give you 10 on pump 9 for $8, so why shouldn't Teyon pump his 9 since you brought 8 and not 10.  (An application used in the Asphalt Mathematics course, part of the Asphalt Masters series).    A word to the monkey should suffice:  "Don't throw poo, that zookeeper's face aint the only thing that will get dirty."

       "Have You Had the Pleasure of Meeting Me?"  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    Well I'm "Drunk", sorry I can't remember YOUR name, because I'm "Drunk". You might not be able to tell, sometimes you can because of my smell. My scent is sometimes warm beer overriding the detergent called Cheer. I might even smell clean as a whistle, like I am a taste-tester for Scope or Listerine, but I'm still who I am, it's just me, just ole "Drunk" me.   I sometimes wind up in the strangest places, 10 or 20 blocks away from any familiar faces. Sometimes I just get in the car and go the left way, not the right way, the left way I said, not even realizing where the music is coming from in my head. Nigga I'm "Drunk". I'll take your girl, man I'm pretty I got a head full of curls, and a liquored up stomach, so I just might earl. Hey, it's me "Drunk" as can be, sleep on the floor and the cabaret chicken wing in hand like a soldier for Stronghold. Man I'm just "Drunk", a nigga sleep with his arms-fold. Hi I'm "Drunk", I don't believe you have had the pleasure, lemme kiss your eyebrow and show you some treasure. I know my pants are down, shoot baby that is my #7 pick. You can call him Luol, Deng-a-Leng that is.   Hi, I'm "Drunk", what did you say? Nigga I am so "Drunk", I mean nigga I am SO "Drunk".  How are you baby you look so good tonight...what???? I'm talking to a tree? Shut up nigga you on a bike. Man I like to pee in the street, maybe even in front of my house, now my lady called me a louse. I'm no louse, I'm "Drunk", don't you know who I am? Hey nigga don't touch me, and get off my Grand Am, don't touch me man don't you know I'm "Drunk". Oh and that's my friend "Pissy", he's behind the tree. Yep he's "Pissy" he drank more than me, oops he stood next to my bathroom-tree. Yep he's sure "Pissy",I just hope he didn't get none on me. Hey Keith, Dewey help me out the car, aw man here's "Pissy" all wet from my post-Remy from the bar. Nigga I'm "Drunk", don't love me, won't you love me, aw nigga just take me home and leave me be.

       "Too Much Remy" By Salvador Gabor    I've never had a taste of any alcoholic beverages in my life. Yet, I've had my share of "Remy". I've had some tall glasses of it too! "Remy" is a strong drink. It seems as if my friends always offer me "Remy" and I never have to pay for it. We maybe in a car, we may be at the mall, or we may see an old friend. All of those are great reasons to get some "Remy". Sometimes when you're out, Bootney and the crew will have you WAY too drunk off that "Remy". Yall get to talking about when Ron used to date Juanita or when LJ and Stephanie were dating. Maybe yall saw Barbara Jean and she still is looking good after 3 kids. That "Remy" kicked in. "Remy" will make you talk about trips to Kings Dominion and how you still have them Etonic's in your basement that you wore to that concert back in '87.   "Remy" can do terrible things to your mind. "Remy" starts off ok then it'll have you about to cry. It'll make you call that ex-girlfriend and start up all the arguements yall had 10 months ago. You were all the way over Jeanette until you had some "Remy". You MIGHT have had a chance to get back with her a year or so from now but, you just HAD to park outside her house and when ole Bill came out, you went BIZERK! All that "REMY"! Blame it on ALL THAT "REMY". "Remy" will make you almost kill somebody. That's a strong drink I tell ya! Sometimes I don't grab a cup when I'm wit my homies. I just sit back and watch them drink. I'll watch for a while and then that "Remy" gets to working. I've seen dudes talk about their so-called "Pro Careers". "I coulda been this, I coulda been that"........ I wish you COULD shut up! We don't wanna hear all of that!  But the worst thing that "Remy" can do is have you stuck in the past. Quite naturally, "Remy" makes you think about the old days but, when the "Remy" makes you THINK you are STILL in 1994, you have a problem. Fellas, you have gained a few pounds. Wearing ONLY a new undershirt out in public as if to say you are "fresh" for the day doesn't cut it when you've gone from 195lbs to 215! Ladies, that dress doesn't fit anymore. It JUST doesn't. That's TOO much "Remy". Regina doesn't like you anymore Donald! Yeah Greg, you played HS football with Jerry Rice but, yall don't talk anymore. Yes, she stole your boyfriend Kesha but, Mo and Donza are married with kids now. It just doesn't make sense for you to still be drinking "Remy" EVERYDAY!   So the next time you are out and your friend wants to go half on a bottle of  "Reminisce",  you tell em "Naw you go on, I'm a stay sober tonight.....too much of that REMY and I'll be ready to slash somebody's tires".

       Sal's Corner "BUNK" Part 1   Everybody say it with me.........."BUNK". I love that word. Soon you will love it too..........no faster then when I tell you what it means. But, the sound that you made when you said "BUNK" tells the whole story. There's no "cute" way to say "BUNK". You might gotta slam your foot when you say "BUNK". You might cock your neck or come with that wild smirk that you have when Regina in the mail room says that you can't used the postage meter to send off personal mail. Nevertheless, I'm vowing to keep it "BUNK" on this article. See, the writers here try to keep some sophistication to the articles but, sophistication and "BUNK" are like oil and water. All class, sophistication and civilized attitudes are thrown out of the nearest window in "BUNKland".   Let me give you the definition of "BUNK". "BUNK" is the glamourization of the lack of sophistication in one's attitude. In other words, you are keeping it hood and you KNOW it. You wear those netted flip flops to work, with that fake Louis Vuitton Purse, with the fake Bucket Hat and the fake Belt to match and are PROUD to tell your co-workers........."YES I LIVE IN LINCOLN HEIGHTS!". Flat out "BUNK". "BUNK" could be ole Keith and Dewey out in the yard at around 7:00 A.M. just-a-drankin. YES........Dranking, not drinking. At some point a shirt is heisted and either Keith or Dewey has their hand on their chest rubbing in a circular motion. All the beers are not finished NOR can they be finished and Dewey has to be at the DMV at 11:00 A.M. to pick up his tags. He's drunk.......SO WHAT. We keeping it "BUNK". As I write this article, I am troubled with the fact that it may take tens of articles to really describe the essence of "BUNK". For those who know.........can't you smell it?? Reggie Dinkins, Jr. talked about "groundhogs" a few months ago. "groundhogs" are those people you don't see ALL winter but, they appear at Hot Bars, Liquor Stores and Check Cashing places all around your city in the summer. All of em are "BUNK".   The word "BUNK" has two meanings to the general public. Most country folk use "BUNK" to describe staying at their house. "Yall are welcome to BUNK up in yaaaah". "Shoot, we all can just BUNK right chere". Yes.......CHERE, not here. The other use of "BUNK" is to define low-grade cocaine. If it aint premium or good...... it's that "BUNK". Either way "BUNK" describes a situation where you have to resort to using a lower method to satisfy your need. No money for Days Inn? Well Aunt Odessa always has a couch. Rodney aint come through with that "butta".........it's always some "BUNK" being snorted over at Lavell's house!!! And from those definitions we at the Salvador Gabor Project came up with the word "BUNK". But, the difference is.....with "BUNK" people, they are HAPPY to be "BUNK". They have resorted to a lower level but, they are proud.   Let's not confuse "BUNK" with being "Ghetto". ANYONE can be "GHETTO". "Ghetto" is popular now. It's almost "commercial" to be "Ghetto". Let me give you a few examples to differentiate the two. Having your three-year old son downtown on "Bring a kid to work day" with plats in his hair, $50 Baby Jordan's, and a gold chain is "Ghetto". But, your three-year old son walking around bare-chested cause it's too hot for a T-shirt is "BUNK". Example 2: A 50 year-old woman living in an apartment with a 35 year-old man for 17 years and they are not married is "GHETTO". That same couple going to the Pocono's with her grandson and his girlfriend is "BUNK". Example 3: Going to a nice restaurant for your 40th birthday and getting too drunk and allowing people to dare you to do the "butterfly" in the middle of the floor is "GHETTO". But making no effort to elevate and having your 40th birthday at "Golden Corral" and having the nerve to make reservations...... NOW THAT'S "BUNK"! I have many more examples but, let's not confuse "Ghetto" with "BUNK". Surburban people have gotten "Ghetto" down-pat. But "BUNK", ohhh you can not get cliff notes on being "BUNK"! One of them ole rappers can't shoot a video full of "BUNK" scenes. You had to have sat in some hot houses in the summer, gone to some cookouts where bare-chested children are allowed to sip beer just so they can have a good night sleep, gone to houses where dogs have their own room with A/C and been out with a "BUNK" person who looks strange when given a card as a key to a hotel room and asks for a key. Oh you must not miss out on an opportunity to engage in "BUNK" convos. You learn so much and learn it so fast. Next week.......I'm gonna give you guy's a crash course on what it is to be "BUNK".

       "An Overnight Scenario" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      The evening has come and Fella got some plans. Fella just came from working out, and Laquan is awaiting his phone call. Fella just showered and is ready for an evening of camel-like proportions. Laquan is looking right good in that Malibu-Keisha teddy she is wearing, and they proceed to slow-cooking them grits. It is now 12:25 A.M. and he is on his way back to the crib, but stop over Terrell's because he is "greening" his evening.   It is now 12:47 and Fella arrives back at the pad, ready for his Friday of work. Fella gets up irons his jeans for "Casual-Friday" and proceeds to wash-up. Now Fella is a man of 27 years old, about 17 years past that "wash-up" stage. This nigga needs to take inventory. Fella thinks that because he bathed prior to wanning Laquan and "gardening" with Terrell that he can just forego a morning shower. So Fella just gonna up and go to work, smelling like Bath, Body & Works and the after-party of a Ziggy Marley show, not to mention that "Trudeau" cologne he sprays on when he gets in the car.   Fella if you don't get in that shower and WARSH (not wash)yourself. Wash-ups are for people ages 0-120 months. If you are grown, reading this, especially if you over 170 lbs as a female, and 200 lbs as a man, wash-up! Yeah you better wash up, down, around and out. If I have offended anyone who has washed-up intentionally and is at work reading this, you may lower your head in your baby-powdered chest in a shameless funk.    "Funk takes on all angles, and is much more sticky than static cling, and very powerful like one of Bootsy's guitar strings. Glory don't be, the funk aint on me, and hopefully not unto you Ms. Pretty. For funk can find your underarm, or the underlying of your left boobity."  --excerpt from The Black Parliament of Health by Professor Buck Naked--

       "A Day in Veteran Negressence: Bunk Soldier's Home" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.         Today we look at the 5th Black Infantry of the Asphalt Marine. This special forces unit, called the Nigerian Task Force "Alley Wolves", was formed way down the street from the Soldier's Home at Stronghold off of North Capitol Street.It was called the Nigerian Task Force because white folks didn't want to say the Nigger Task Force to the media, that and these fighting niggas were of midnight descent. The "Alley Wolves" came about under the watchful eye of Major Kearny. Major Pilate Kearny wasn't no military man, just a serious little nigga whose name was actually Major, and was always dressed in green. An expert in concrete-combat, he installed his own form of fighting style named after himself, "The Pilates".   Major Kearny carried around a short horse whip, because he used to race horses down Hains Point. He was a little guy who was called upon by Booga Jones, a wealthy Black entrpreneur, to help calm crime in certain sections of DC, Oakland, and Kingston, Jamaica where Booga Jones earned his living. He often called upon the "Alley Wolves" to break-up neighborhood watch groups, policed-block parties on main hustling riffs, and any unorganized heethantry.   It was July 8, 1977 on a hot day down in Kingston. Booga Jones had been having some problems with some local "candy-stripers" trying to hone in on his business. These "candy-stripers" aka The Hocus Pocus Dread-Mafia were selling product out of a Rastafarrian nursing home, called "Slow Wine". The home was actually right next to one of Mr. Booga Jones' "lawnmower shops". Booga Jones sent for the "Alley Wolves" and they stormed "Slow Wine" with no guns, they left those in Oakland the Vicelords requested them that day for rent, armed with nothing but their Pilates. The Hocus Pocus crew began shooting, and task force, used many an old folk as a senior-shield. The task force of 24 wiped out the Hocus Pocus crew in less than twenty minutes. An onlooker, Henry St.Clair was quoted at the scene "They run up on them Pocus boys like dogs sent from above".   These Bunk Veterans were given a soldier's welcome when they arrived to Booga Jones' mansion, The Jamaican Shanty. It is on this day that Pilates classes will be $5 off to commerate the "Alley Wolves" victory over the Hocus Pocus Dread-Mafia. To order your "Alley Wolves" Action Photo Gallery please contact Portier Taylor at 301-455-3534.

       "Is that you ReRe?" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       You ever see how some women get with guys and change their lives for the better? Well contrary to certain Whitney and Tammi-Fae type situations it does happen. If you look at it, Valerie made Nick's life "solid as a rock". Oh, I am not sure if you have heard about "ReRe"...   "ReRe" is a smart woman who has a lot going for her, she has met many men and changed their lives for the better. She is kind of like Cleopatra X when you think about it, changing mindsets and names along the way. "ReRe" met a nigga named "Tain" way back when. Now "Tain" was all about taking what he could and was in a self-imprisoned state after his last relationship with "D", but he could never really rely on what he took, until he met "ReRe". "ReRe" helped him gain knowledge to keep what he acquired and not just blow it all away. After meeting "ReRe", brother "Tain" changed his ways and kept more of what he acquired whether it was information, money, or even bootleg cookout equipment. The brotha even changed his name to "Retain". That is pretty serious for a non-mother to make a nigga take her name.   "ReRe" also met another nigga years later. A hopeless nigga, a nigga without direction, the type of dude already drunk in the liquor store at 2 o'clock. This nigga was trying to find himself aimlessly walking down life's blouevards looking for "Spect". "ReRe" found "Spect" wandering close to 66th & Down and Out. She pulled up on him and told him to get in. "Spect" was a selfish man, and she taught him that unless you give some "Spect" you won't find any. That simple notion opened his wine-shut eyes, and "Spect" began to control himself and anyone he dealt with. He even changed his name to "Respect" after that simple talk in "ReRe's" Aurora.   Now "ReRe" was no saint, and did have some knuckleheads along the way. Some niggas she met shooting dice in the back of ribpits that just weren't about anything. Ole "Gress" and his brother "Gret" were two pitiful niggas she met in an alley. They liked to stand in the alley get high and talk about their problems, and things that they should have done. They often mocked "ReRe" and messed with her til she left them one cold July morning. They waited for her return, but never saw her again, only changing their names to "Regress" and "Regret" hoping the mere mention of her name would bring her back.   Advice can be offered in alleys but, if you are a pessimist your only optimism is bad, like cooking bacon butt-naked. So don't look-off advice, no matter the source, male or female it could be a resource. If you have nothing but your balls and your word, that bacon won't burn your word, so put some pants on and maybe even a thinking cap, because nourishment is best served unburned.

       Sal's Corner (cont'd) "BUNK" Part 2    Before you read any further, PLEASE stop. Just stop and if you have a strong imagination I want you to think of a song. How bout.........."The Electric Slide". YEP that's it. NOW, as you read KEEP that song in your head. Forget the lyrics, they are useless right now. Just, keep the beat in your head. Can you hear that whistle? OK. you hear it too? Aight let's keep it moving.  Now don't lose that beat cause it's what gets us in a "BUNK" mood. The reason why that song is important is because "The Electric Slide" was one of my first exposures to the "BUNK" lifestyle. Your daddy could be on the side eating ribs and chilling. He hears that song and almost spills the whole rib plate on his white linen suit tryna run to that floor. The reaction when that song comes on is unstoppable. Don't bring your caucasion co-worker along to the "get-to-together". You tryna act all sophisticated like you don't drink Steel Reserves and nip on a lil Mad Dog. Then THAT song comes on. And you can't help it! That's that "BUNK" feeling. Now I'm a show yall how to spot a "BUNK" person...........   * Technology - If your mother and father have cell phones, DVD's, satellite TV and pagers but, don't know how to work em..........YET they know the steps to the "Electric Slide".......oh it's some "BUNK" going on in here.  * Denim - Too much Denim can get nasty. You, your wife AND your son JT at the concert with Jean Outfits on is NOT cool. That's that "BUNK".  * Adding the letter "S" to words - For those of you who live near D.C., don't you just wanna scream when that old lady says "YEAH I been to DreamSSSS"? The place is called "DREAM" not "DreamS"!. "Tell Gloria to pick me up a carton of Milk from the SafewayS". The grocery store is call Safeway. There is NO "S" at the end. Or what about this......."Those are some nice Gentlemens over there for you Retha". You betta hope that Retha doesn't walk up to one of them men talking all "BUNK" like that. Gentlemen is plural, no need for an "S".  * Adding the letter "R" to words - Now "BUNK" people TRY to be sophisticated SOME of the time. They might get up in Red Lobster and say......."I think I'll take a SODER". "BUNK" people have been "BUNK" so long that they don't think that proper pronounciations of words may end in vowels. In the example, they may use "SODER" but, they are tryna say "SODA". Or they might go to a furniture store and say "I'm looking for a burgundy SOFER". It's SOFA.   Sidenote: Now if you haven't heard any of these examples then you aint been exposed to "BUNK". For those who are and have been exposed, turn that radio up in your mind. Can you still hear the "Electric Slide"?   * Eating while out of town - If you eat Off-Brand Honey Buns, Liver Pudding, Pork Rinds, and or sit in the open area of the double-doors of your van while eat cheese sandwiches.............your are definitely "BUNK".  * House Attire - Gowns, nighties and robes are to be worn before 10:00 A.M. and After 9:30 P.M.. Anything between those hours can be grounds for being seen as being "BUNK". Now grandmothers, women over 60 and pregnant women are an exception.   * Basement - If you still have that "red light" by the defunct bar in your basement you are "BUNK". And it wouldnt't hurt to take those Rick James posters down either.   * Crossed Legs - "BUNK" women don't cross their legs. Most of em say "Shoot Im 65 years old. Whoever wanna see my stuff is just gonna have to see it cause my leg is too sore to be lifting over top of the other".    Ya know........I had many examples of "BUNK" behavior but, I can't do a "BUNK" Part 12!!! I just can't. We'll be here for years. But, just read over parts 1 and 2 and if you see any questionable "BUNK" behavior, feel free to email me. If you have any stories of "BUNK" people, I'd be happy to listen to them. I'm always ready and eager to hear about my "BUNK" people. Yes.....MY people. Deep down I too am "BUNK". But, I strategize my "BUNKness". We all need it from time to time. Just don't overuse it. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin".       People to Stay Away From (for the month of July)  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      As the weather gets warmer, it makes the weird niggas swarm. Folks get crazy and tend to stray way away from the norm. Now we as people know there are certain things that we ought to stay away from, like fatty foods, fat people in tight spaces, and doughnuts with flies in the doughnut case.   People in Flannel: Now it is July and unless you work construction there is no reason that you should be wearing flannel, unless you are over on Walker Mill for the Lumberjack Games on July 32nd. People who are wearing flannel, for non construction/lumberjack reasons, are interestingly dangerous. They are wearing those outfits because they are stuck in a number of time warps, i.e. the mid 80's and early 90's, or because it is suitable front porch attire and because it is a perfect beer-drinking outfit. Nonetheless, you don't want ole Dempsey to come down off that porch.   People with Overly Visible Baby Powder: Now these people tend to be dark niggas over 40, and busty older women.  These older males tend to have a t-shirts with cut-off sleeves, and are usually wearing walkmen, which in itself is dangerous. Niggas over 40 should not have walkmen. They could listening to anything from Trouble Funk to Air Raid or The Temptations. Busty older women with powder on their cleavage. This is a very disturbing because you know Ms. Moore is wearing that v-cut turtle-neck because it is Tuesday and then she goes and dumps what appears to be Bisquick all in she shirt. Now she looks like a mother panda ready to nurse Janitor Mixon, who can't get enough of Ms. Moore. Oh I can't forget about my big guys. Big dudes love that baby powder, but I can't blame Big Kevin for trying to stay cool. Not to mention that if Kevin's second layer of self between his neck and hip heats up, we could all be in for a world of trouble.   People with 2 Ice Cream Cones: Now this could be a ploy.  Sometimes you are places and they give away free ice cream, and Brenda is acting like she is taking it to Sharon.  Needless to say, she is just trying to looking cute with those 2 cones, because she is working hard to seduce Janitor Mixon.   That Nigga with the Crabmeat on His Bottom Lip: Oh you know this guy. If he aint your uncle, he treats you like he is your uncle, or like you are his. He either makes sure you got a beer, or makes a meek face at you when you notice he is on Michelob number 8.  This guy sits down and says "oh let me get in this bushel". He is eating crabs early, and that is when crabmeat first meets him. So you notice it, and you are thinking "it comes with the territory", but, 2 beers 12 crabs, and a plate of ribs chicken, potato salad and cole slaw, and it is still just hanging out on his lip. Lodell is in on every conversation, from Redskins-Cowboys talk, to Kobe, and is even showing a pretty girl how to eat crabs. Oh the crabmeat does disappear on the 10th beer, but guess what, it comes right back on Lodell's last long sip. Ladies watch out, he is the nigga that hugs you too tight at family/non-family functions.    "A word to the wino should suffice. If you drink to get drunk, then drunk you will be long after the drink has been drunk."  --Lodell Thomas, Minority Shareowner (see Consumation Act of LSE '99) of Bass Liquors--

       "Non-Profit Organizers" By Salvador Gabor    I have gained a new found respect for "Non-Profit Organizers". In a normal world, a "Non-Profit Organization" is a company that does not sell a product but, more than likely provides a services and is funded by the government, sponsorships from other companies and/or donations. These organizations receive funding and from that amount that run their business. Any excess of that is put back into the company for future use. Most of these organizations do good deeds such as feeding the poor, educating children or maybe promoting the awareness of a particular disease. All in all good deeds are being done and needs are being met due to the presence of "Non-Profit Organizations".  There is a vast difference between a "Non-Profit Organization" and a "Non-Profit Organizer". A "Non-Profit Organizer" is that middle-aged man in your neighborhood that does little "odds -n- ends" jobs to make enough money for the day to eat, drink, trick on a woman and get a back of weed and/or crack. Most people who patronize these "Organizers" don't have any idea where their money is going or if they do, they try to deny it. We all see these "organizers" in the morning on our way to work and in the evening. EVEN late at night, they are just-a-"organizing". "Yeah I gotta hit Mrs. Mayfield's yard, then I gotta trim some hedges over at Jesse's house and..............OK NIGGA Im a wash yo' car, I'll be right back..... Im a bidness man, give me some time DARNELL!". Always planning and strategizing as a true "organizer should".   You ever wonder......with all that work and skilled labor under their belts, why don't these "Non-Profit Organizers" have any money? Well when your heroin habit outweighs your goal of saving $375 for a lawnmower, you are in deep trouble mister. You'll be cutting that grass with a push mower forever. It takes you 2 hours to cut a yard that a lawnmower does in 30 minutes. Money lost for certain but, thats a "Non-Profit Organizer" for ya! No need for a profit. Just make enough money to get two strong meals, some drank and a pack of cigarettes.   Today we must tip our hats and salute all the Kevin's, Leroy's, Trenell's and Lavell's of the world who aimlessly do our yardwork and wash our cars just to get high and drunk only to be knocking on our doors again tomorrow morning to see if Grandma needs him to put the air conditioner in the back room.

       "Mr. Randolph's Fables: How the Wind Works"  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      The following is an excerpt from one of Mr. Randolph's Fables. Mr. Randolph is an old man, who can be found on your major thorofare, or on his stoop. If you ask him for some news he will tell you some, but if you ask him for a story he will tell you one too.   One day Anthony, Mrs. Shepherd's youngest boy Herbie's son, walked up to Mr. Randolph and asked him a question, "Mr. Randolph, why is it so windy out here?" Mr. Randolph looked up at the sky and said, "Well many many years ago, there was an old man named Lavay and he asked that very same question."   Well you see Lavay was a man who often wondered about certain things from walking cats, and dyslexic catering (or catering to the dyslexic depending upon how you pose the question). Lavay wandered around for days on end scouring the streets questioning young and old as to why it is so windy. And a man (many believe to be Mr. Randolph, seeing as though he has been around and seen many things) told him that the wind winds, you see that is what the wind does....it winds. Crows crow and people people, and the wind well, it winds.  he wind winds for many reasons.  It makes sail boats go, it dries clothes.  The things are called blowjobs, you see when the wind blows it is doing a job. You see when you work with many different jobs, those are oddjobs.   So Anthony wanted to know if when he cooled something off with hot sauce on it, what was that. Well Mr. Randolph told him it was a blowjob, and pretty much anything making wind was a blowjob. Anthony took his new-found learning and ran with it. He later caught his daddy drinking some pot-liquor off the greens from last night. Needless to say some flatulence followed. Young Anthony went and told his momma that his daddy was giving blowjobs. Anthony liked to have created a riot, Ms. Patricia thought she married a queer, til she caught wind of the blowing.   Anthony still gainfully new-knowledged was on his way to LeShon's surprise birthday party, and found LeShon's aunt Sonja and the birthday clown blowing up balloons on the side of the house. He goes in and tells Ralph, Sonja's boyfriend, "Yeah I saw Sonja outside giving a blowjob to the clown."  Needless to say, ole Tommy the Clown didn't need any dark makeup that day.   Mr. Randolph says the moral of this story, is be careful which way the wind blows. Just because you smell or hear something doesn't necesarrily mean it is the wind blowing.  You see hot air can be produced by many things, and artificial wind doesn't come from Chicago.      "News Report" By Salvador Gabor    * Hubbard Cunningham won the "2004 Clovell Piece Prize" for his Wing Dinner Delicatessan served nice and hot from "Hubbard's HeartAttacks on a Plate", located on 125th & Amsterdam in Harlem, NY.

       Sal's Corner "NICKNames Vol. 1" aka "The INITIAL version"    For those who are avid readers of the Salvador Gabor Project and Jeromebaker.blogspot.com, we have spent a few Mondays discussing Names. At first, we did Male First Names, then Female First Names, THEN Last Names. NOW, we are leading into NICKNames. I want you guys to follow me and listen very attentively. The following are Nicknames that begin with the appropriate initial. Now if your name is Tony, you name begins with a "T" (of course) but, if your Nickname is "Tone-Tone", Im not talking to you on this segment. I'm talking to those who are called by their initial AND there is some sort of hyphen after it. I.E. A-Rod, T-Mac, D-Nice. That kinda thing. So dig if you will this picture  Warning: NOT all people who fit this category apply to the description. There are exceptions to the rules.   * The Initial "T" - Niggas wit the Initial "T" are usually full of love. "HEY there's T!". "UH OH There go my nigga T!". Or you might just hear......"OLE T........thats my nigga!". You can't help but love a T. I know a few "T's" and they all are great people. "T's" will get fresh on you in a minute. They break out the new shoes (soft, casual AND basketball shoes). "T" stays fly. But, they does it lightly.   * The Initial "D" - Smooth. What more can I say than that. "D" is the kinda dude that can play ball in a Versace Sweatsuit, fresh white tee, some suede shoes, OUTSIDE on a crate, AND NOT sweat or get dirty. The type of dude that will play you one on one, take his white tee off and lay it gently on a gate, and whip you 32-6. Put his tee back on, zip up the sweatsuit and go ride out on the town.   * The Initial "J" - Now "J" is kinda fly and kinda smooth. "J" is in between. He doesnt have all the flyness of "T" or all the smoothness of "D" but he is in between. He has a "hood swagger". He aint gotta be dressed to kill or spitting alot of game but the whole hood excepts "J". "J" gets that welcoming love like "T" does. The only difference is that "T's" love is a little more suttle. Everyone knows that "T" is laid back but "J"............oh niggas love "J" cause he is always ready to make a move. "J's" keep some sort of drug paraphenalia. Whether it be weed, coke, blunts or top paper. He has it.  * The Initial "C" - One word..........WILD. Watch "C". 'Cause "C" might be a Curtis, a Charles or a Cornelius. Just wild type dudes from the break. Then once they start being called just "C" or "C-Bone", it's a WRAP! They are destine for criminal activity.   * The Initial "V" - Oh yeah, "V" and "C" are hanging right together. They sell crack on the same block. "V" comes through in the old Z300 and "C" is just riding dirty in the 2-door Caprice Classic. "V" is a hustler. All about dat doe, ya heard me???? But he cool though. Just get his money to him when he needs it.   * The Initial "E" - HOTHEAD. I know alot of niggas whose names start with "E" but they ALL AREN'T called "E". But the ones who are........don't play with them. They don't START the trouble. 90% of the time, "E" is innocent but, winds up in the mix. "E" is just tryna have a good time, that's ALL. But, get an "E" fired up. You will get burned!  * The Initial "Q" - See.........."Q" is never the dude that YOU know. He is always somebody else's man. Ya homie might say "Yeah I'm waiting on Q right now".........then you say "Who is Q?", your homie replies...."AWW nigga you know Q, the dude wit da Big Head!" You can't quite figure a "Q" out. Well first of all it's because his name is probably Quincy, Quinton, or Quarles. You just never know.  * Females with Initials - Notice, my article has been male-dominated. There is a reason behind this. If a female (better yet YOUR female), has a nickname that begins with an initial...............STAY AWAY from her. She is a Class A hoodrat. Do not let your wife/girlfriend be called "Baby J", "D-Honey", "O-liv" or no other hoodratish nickname.   Next week, we may dib and dab into some other types of nicknames. But for now let this soak in. "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

       "Menstrual Cycle" By Salvador Gabor    "I need this done by tomorrow....PERIOD!". "I'm gonna be this way till I die.......PERIOD". When the "PERIOD" comes, it's serious. Ever so often you gotta put your foot down. This is what it is and this is how it's gonna be done. You don't like it, SO WHAT! That's how must people acting when they are on their "PERIOD". You just gotta let em know, nahmean! It's not alot to it.  In the "regular" world that we live in, only women have "PERIODS". But, in our minds, we ALL have "PERIODS". It's not a monthly cycle. It depends on your tolerance level. Some people don't mind drawing unemployment checks for two months. But, on that THIRD month............if a job don't come through, it's gonna be some trouble. Oh yeah, I didn't tell yall,  these  "PERIODS" can get bloody too. When a "PERIOD" comes on, people are willing to rob, kill, steal or do whatever. Cause it has to get done........."PERIOD"!   What is a "PERIOD"? It's a mark that notes the end of a sentence or statement. You always end a sentence with a "PERIOD". Whether you write it out or put the little dot at the end. The "PERIOD" will mark the end of that statement. In this world, people always seem to get to a point where they've had enough. When you are 15, you've havd enough of being treated like a child. When you are 18, you're tired of going to school. When you are 21, you are tired of the same ole tired kinds of people of the opposite sex approaching you. When you are 25, you are tired of being single. By the time you are 30, you are tired of being married. By 35, you are tired of paying a mortgage. Then by 40 you've ran into "MENOPAUSE". This means that you will no longer have those "PERIODS". Whatever you are doing at that point, you will just bear with it. No more bleeding, no more anger sprees, no need to worry about "birthing" anymore opportunities. You just settle for where you are.  The point of the matter is, when you are going through a "PERIOD", don't be angry and use that as an excuse to be cranky. Understand that it takes these "PERIODS" to remind you that you are still capable of "birthing" ideas that can change this world, let alone your own life.

       Sal's Corner   "The Back Room"    Oh yes. Walk with me a bit. Don't be afraid. Some of yall think yall are too sophisticated. But regardless, we need to take a walk into "The Back Room". No..........it's NOT the Den! That's to "sophisticated". If you call it the Den, you aint feelin' me right now. I mean "The Back Room". "The Back Room" holds alot of hidden treasures and I want to unveil those treasure to you all. So, let's take a walk.............   *  Lighting  - In "The Back Room", the lighting is almost always a lil darker than the rest of the house. That dark signifies a cooler atmosphere. You don't even have to cut on the AC in the back room. That darkness in the daytime just makes it so comfortable back there. IF (And I say IF) the AC IS on........it runs smoothly. You can almost NOT hear the AC at all. It's so quiet and relaxing   *  Eating/Drinking  - This activity is LIMITED in the backroom. Eating is only permitted to old Uncles on regular days. And usually he doesn't do it if there are guests in the house. IF (And I say IF) there is drinking it is mostly Iced Tea. Maybe a lil beer here and there but Iced Tea is the drink of choice for "Back Roomers". "Back Roomers" are simply people who frequent the back room.   *  Funerals  - "The Back Room" is a staple in the African-American tradition of remembering the dead. After a funeral, only the VIP's sit in "The Back Room". Now if you aint a VIP, you might sneak back there for a while but surely, you WONT get a seat! Vintage "Back Roomers" only get seats. Now after a funeral, VERY important stuff like "who is gonna get the clothes?", "how are the children gonna split the funeral bill?" and "why was JB left off the will?" are discussed in "The Back Room".   *  Pictorials  - "The Back Room" is filled with Photo Albums and pictures on the wall. "The Back Room" is a Hall of Fame of sorts for each family. Graduation Pics are usually on the wall. They are placed towards the top. Pics that were taken at Sears are more towards the bottom. Wedding Pics are on the coffee table. Different types of pics are strategically placed and spaced by "The Back Room's" caretaker.   *  Reading Material  - You can find an array of Ebony and Jet magazines from the 1980's somewhere in The Back Room". Those mags go back so far, Vanessa Williams is on the cover receiving her crown for the Miss America Pageant. You won't find any new books or magazines though.   *  Television  - See.........one thing about the back room is, technology is limited. There's no need for a DVD, Grandma JUST bought a VCR a year ago. Well actually Aunt Bessie got it for her cause she wasnt gonna go out and buy one herself. But the TV in "The Back Room" aint cut on that much. When it's on, it's stuck on the news. That's all that's watched back there. You MAY be lucky to get some cable on a TV in the back room. If Grandma got cable, she got it turned to CNN. And thats IT!   *  Furniture  - Don't expect fancy furniture. It's nice but, not fancy. Of course we've all had a crash course on the plastic on the furniture. That summer afternoon nap that is interrupted by your face being stuck to the plastic. WE all know about that already. But, the furniture back there is mix-matched. Or as your auntee would say "Mitch-Matched". There are alot of rugs and blankets and towels on the chairs in the backroom. See this was input during the 80's when the Jheri Curl was poppin. "Put them towels on the headrest of the couch Lil Winky.......Sheila coming over here and that girl neck is SO wet!........aint messing up my couch".   *  Odd Items  - "The Back Room" is where you might find the portable "feet soaker" or an exercise machine or frisbees that are now used as coasters. Anything can be used to decorate the back room.   All in all, the back room is a traditioned-filled area where love, memories and talks about Willamena's gay son Bootney are discussed. You gotta love........."THE BACK ROOM". "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

       "Ronnie Gaskins' Retirement Press Conference" By Salvador Gabor    This is somewhat "breaking news" in the card playing industry. Spades legend Ronnie Gaskins, decides to put down his hand for the final time. Ronnie, the 38-year old Verizon Phone Technician sees no need to prolong his retirement from the card playing/speak-easy industry. Introduced to the game in the hallways of Ballou High School, located in Washington, D.C., he went from the ranks of Junior 3rd Floor Tunk Champion to the #1 Contender for the Ballou/Spingarn Spades Co-Championship. He and his avid partner, Jo-Jo Wiggins have defeated many of their competitors in a destructive fashion. They held the highest average for "books" bidded in the entire city. 10.5 books a game was an astonishing number to bid. They ran "Boston's" on almost every opponent in at least one hand during matchups. Ronnie and ole Jo-Jo were surely a tandem to be reckoned with. I had the chance to be in attendance for the retirement press conference and I have some of the manuscript from the event    Ronnie: Good evening and a special "Wuz up witchall niggas" going out to all in attendence. It is with great sadness, yet great joy that I announce my retirement from the D.C. Area Speak-easy/Card League. This was a hard decision but, one that had to be made. I came to this point in my life when talking to my good friend Jo-Jo. I mean, niggas is getting older. We like 38 now. It's time for a new generation of card players. I shot dice, I played cards, and I even tried to play video games. I'm a gambler at heart but, it's no need anymore. I'm tired of the games and I want to take some rest. I don't have much more to say but if there any questions, feel free   Reporter: So Ronnie, what will Jo-Jo do without you?  Ronnie: Thats my nigga fo sho! He still shooting dice down on 15th & V. Occasionally, he'll go up the hill on Belmont and play some cee-lo. He aint ready to leave yet but, he understood my decision  Reporter: Do you think that as a tandem, there will ever be any two players like you and Jo-Jo?  Ronnie: Understand this........Jo-Jo and Ronnie ran this city. But we never RAN this city. You follow me........See we didnt have to run around looking for players. Alot of clowns came looking for us. And we always cleaned up! Believe that champ. Many may try to be us, and even if they are the next Ronnie and Jo-Jo, that's an honor for someone to wanna be Ronnie or Jo-Jo.   Reporter: Speakeasy's and card playing are sports that most don't BEGIN until their 30's, why retire so early!?!?!?  Ronnie: I don't really have the patience to play wit dem old folks. The game goes by too slow. Them old fat women wanna hit on a nigga. Too many distractions. Plus, Jo-Jo has been leaning more to shooting dice.  Reporter: Can we look forward to seeing you shoot some dice anytime soon?  Ronnie: I might do a lil bit of side-betting on Jo-Jo but, other than that.........naw I can't see it.  Reporter: I saw an interview on the Salvador Gabor Report months ago about Ricardo "Shake Em Up" Baker, he has reportedly challenged you and Jo-Jo to shoot some craps. You're telling me that you would decline such a challenge?  Ronnie: Always know that niggas will be niggas. Dice is 'Cardo's game. I do it but, for real, I aint into being on my knees that long. I don't do too much on my knees other than pray. Any man on his knees as long as 'Cardo has a "problem" if you know what I mean.  Reporter: That seems to be a low-blow?  Ronnie: Call it how you see it, I may not shoot dice but, I still Slap-Box. And you can tell 'Cardo that the next time he go running and issuing challenges!!!  Reporter: Any last words?  Ronnie: I live by this quote, "Never Re-Nig.......MY Nig!"    Well, there you have it........a legend for the ages. Will we see Ronnie and Jo-Jo take another stab at a Spades Championship? Will we see one team stay on the table for 15 hours as Ronnie and Jo-Jo did one summer night after Minnesota Ave. Day? Will we ever ever ever see the likes of Ronnie Gaskins? We will never know. But, we'll always be on the lookout  This is Salvador Gabor signing off.     This sports update was brought to you by Winkie's Pharmaceuticals.

       "Political Outlook: DNC" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.    This week is a very important time in American politics. Many valuable opinions are made, choices about our future, and billions of dollars potentially change hands this week. With these national conventions going on, wealth and opportunity as well as safety and education find themselves in a political connundrum. The "DNC" addresses these issues and more.   The "Dice-a-cratic National Convention" is being held in Oakland, CA this year. It is at the "DNC" where future leaders are made, and where current leaders establish themselves as the makers takers and shakers of society. A place where politics are discussed, from Bush-Kerry to Tom and Jerry, from the Capitol to the Crapitol, from the if's and but's of the Cuban Missile Crisis to fifths and cards cut over Hennessey and other "devices". The "DNC" is a great place to be where, hustlers come up and pimps re-up. Catfights erupt over who is the first Bottom-Brawd of the Nation. Feel the fever and smell the chiba of the "DNC".   One of the fresh faces and up-and-coming young dicers at the "DNC" is Julian Sykes-Harris. Only 15yrs old, this young man possesses the charisma needed to hold a crowd without talking loud, but continously shooting craps while his paper is stacked to the clouds. He has achieved nationwide respect throughout the West Coast, New Orleans, DC, and Tex-Arcana as a serious shooter of craps. His year-to-date earnings are estimated at over $372,000.  Former spokesperson of the "DNC" Rudy Ray Moore, was present at the Convention last night and described Sykes-Harris' $15,000 supper shoot as such. "From c-lo to Belo, nigga to Phillipino, this mofo is hard to beat though. A monkey or a beracuda ole Jules is a sure straight shooter, whether he is playing for jewels or yards not measured by rulers. I just call him Skippy because he needs no jam, he keeps his money in peanut butter jars when he goes to the can, a real crap shooter a helluva man."   Mr. CIAA, Raleigh's most famous haberdasherer, also appeared at the "DNC's" gala last night, which aired on D-Span, Detroit's Underground Gubment network. Mr. CIAA was featured wearing a beige linen suit from head to toe in order to stay cool in yesterday's 94 degree temperature, a beige linen bucket, and a black belt made of panther skin. The "DNC's" Contributor's Ball, also known as the "Player's Ball", will be held on Friday. Meshach, Winston, Alonzo, and Bradley of the famous GMC GoldMiner's Crew will be in attendance. All men of distinction are encouraged to attend. Nominees for "DNC" Spokesman this year are Shannon "Sooky" Marshall, Pie "Sweet Potato" White, and Dick "Honey" Washington who was quoted last night as saying "Friday night don't get mad if you can't beat me because I'll win, don't be sad if you can't get a ride from me because my passenger is your best friend, don't be glad when I come because you might not see Dick again."

       "The Whether Man" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.   Many people tend to think certain astrological things determine their livelyhood, if they will find love and or money. Well the "Whether" Man thinks that "whether" you do or "whether" you don't depends on you, and not the weather. Rain while the sun is shining doesn't mean that some Cherokee is doing a rain dance. It might mean "whether" you move when this Cherokee is coming might get you splashed with rain, and doing a dry-off dance.   Libra:  If you feel your palm itching it doesn't necessarily mean you will get some money, it might just mean stop rubbing Phyllis' feet. Athlete's foot might get you agile-hand.  Oh and if your throat is sore, needless to say your tongue might be a three-sport star, and Athletic than a mutha!   Leo:  "Whether" someone talks about you, has nothing to do with your ear itching. You might want to take a q-tip to that ear, might be some Ash and Waxy-Works candles in your ear. People talk about you for several reasons, they like you don't like you, don't know you, or maybe your zipper is down and your wang they're beloving. Who really knows but, "whether" you wash yourself or "whether" you don't could be the reason for all that chitter-chatter.  May your "whether" be good, and cheerful but if someone harasses you, may you be hood and sincereful Good "whether" and hood "whether" might vary depending on the daily front But bad weather and bad "whether" might depend on her monthly stunt Dont let menstrual actions pervade your mindset and dampen Wednesday plans, because your mines is clotty and wet "Whether" you do and "whether" you don't doesn't depend on a paycheck, it could be actions stunted by a wet-cigarette. Doped minds aint dope minds, and if you think dope mines are Colombian finds "Whether" you went down R Street in 89 could have been your white kind of find "Whether" you do or "whether" you dont is all on you but make sure you lock your inner-monkey "whether" you are at the parking lot or the zoo. "Whether" change the "m" or "d" can make it mommy or daddy or make a monkey a donkey, but either way you a nigga acting badly. The "whether" will change, so prepare accordingly, despite the weather, big girls might not dress accordingly.

       Can You Hear Me Now?  By Gartrelle W. Sexton, Esq.    Happy Tuesday good people. It's been a while since I've been able to voice my thoughts, I hope everyone is doing well and your car didn't get stolen or you didn't get shot while just standing on a street corner.   MY MAN Bill Cosby has pissed some people off with his remarks about the Black community. I intended to say a lot about this situation but I have had this discussion too many times already. I'll just say this, Bill was RIGHT. Instead of being mad about poverty, poor family values, and poor education, some Black people are mad at Bill for simply saying that these things are problems in our community.  You may not agree with the way he said what he said, but what he said was right.  I don't want to hear anything about "What is Bill doing?" or "What about Fat Albert?"  Bill has done more than his fair share for our community.  Don't ask "What is Bill going to do?" What are WE going to do?   Now, I'm going to take this in a totally different direction. Cell phones. More specifically, ring tones. If you are not a 15 year-old girl with posters of B2K or Lil Bow Wow on your wall, there is no reason to turn your phone into a jukebox.  It's not cute, it's not cool, it's not "just something to do." It's ANNOYING, it's LOUD, and it's just downright DUMB. You are GROWN, a simple "ring, ring" or "beep, beep, beep" will suffice. (To that big dude on the Metro that has George Clinton's "Flashlight" for your ringer, give it up. The Mothership landed in 1978 and unfortunately for me it didn't take you when it left.)   This Cell Phone Rant was sponsored by The DC Drug Dealers Chapter of B.E.E.P. Brothers Embracing the Existence of Pagers.    Randumb Quote of the Day: "Fear is your best friend or your worst enemy. It's like fire. If you can control it, it can cook for you; it can heat your house. If you can't control it, it will burn everything around you and destroy you. If you can control your fear, it makes you more alert, like a deer coming across the lawn." --Mike Tyson (Yeah, Mike Tyson said that. It even made sense up until the part about the deer.)    I will leave you with an African proverb that I hope will prove inspirational for you:   Every morning as the sun rises, a gazelle wakes up.  It knows that it must outrun the fastest lion or it will be eaten.  Every morning as the sun rises, a lion wakes up.  It knows that it must outrun the slowest gazelle or it will starve to death.  Regardless of whether you are a gazelle or a lion, when the sun comes up you better be running!   Happy trails to you until we meet again...       Live from Barnes & Noble by Salvador Gabor       This is Salvador Gabor, always on a quest to find the best educational tools and resources to enlighten you good folks on what this world beholds. I am in the Barnes & Noble on Alabama Ave. & Wheeler Road in Southeast D.C.. I know some of you may be saying to yourselves...."Aint no bookstore on Alabama & Wheeler????" Well dont judge a book by its cover and definitely always know that a crackhouse is not always JUST a crackhouse. When they are not using bookstands to snort on, books occupy those spaces as well. Well anyway as I sit in this crackhouse/barnes & nobles, waiting from my man to chop up his dope so we can go to the Run & Shoot and play some ball I ran across a book.............     "The Passion of Edmonds" is a great book to pick up. It is a book that entails the life of Rayful Edmonds, one of the greatest narcotic leaders of our time. Who else do you know that can literally throw away millions of $1 bills? Who else do you know that would give you a $100 Bill to go to the store and argue you down because you GAVE them back their change? We're talking about some major hustling baby. Im talking bout '88 Audi's in '86. Gucci flip flops and shirts when everybody was wearing coca-cola shirts.      This book has inspired many young hustlers to be about their paper and get this fetti thats to be made in these here streets. This book has been the foundation for a new religion in D.C.............."The Nation of Edmond". Not to be confused with The Nation of Islam. "The Nation of Edmond" (Pronounced Ed-MOND), has thousands of young kids feeling that they can be millionaires from crack sales. I wont give away the story at all but trust as a young writer once stated........   "Everybody wanna be Scarface but, they aint see the end of the movie"     -Jayson Phillips-

       "The Magical World of Lou Jackson" By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.       Welcome boys and girls, niggas and ladies, to the first trip to the Magical World of Lou Jackson. Now sit down Indian-style and take it all in. Now don't forget to look both ways before crossing the street Marc grab Man-Man's hand before I get you both.   You might be wondering what is so magical about the world of Lou Jackson, it looks just like South Carolina. Well my friends, have you ever met a man with a pet squirrel, or a lady made out of chocolate, a real-live archangel or a wino who didn't dance. Put the music on, welcome welcome to the Magical World of Lou Jackson.   There was a man named Peephole Brooks. Now they called him Peephole because he claims to have invented the peep-hole but, Tommy Tammy's brother Tommy with the electric walker told me they started calling him that because he would stand so close to the peep-hole when he rang your doorbell, they just started calling him Peephole. Now old Peephole was an interesting man to say the least. He enjoyed boxed-wine, pickled herring, and actually prefered to eat fish-bait more than the fish itself. It was through his early morning fishing in Charleston, SC eating half-cooked chicken-livers that he met what would become his life-long friend, Rudy.   You see Rudy was a squirrel. Rudy came up to Peephole and asked him for some of them chicken-livers, "Say nigga what's up with a breakdown?" Peephole was shocked, not that the squirrel was talking to him, hell he heard squirrels all the time when he would sit in the woods and do his "potting". He was shocked that Rudy asked him for some BBQ sauce for them livers. They sat and they talked fished a little bit, and talked some more. Before they knew it Thursday had come and gone. Rudy, quite the avid jitterbugger, learned that Peephole was quite the harmonica player. Rudy could also do summersaults, and other flips on demand, well he was a squirrel, but his movement had a nigga-like rhythm to it.   It was at this very moment that the two figured they could make a living thru their friendship. I mean how often is it that you see a man with a pet squirrel, not to mention ole Rudy talks. So summer rolled around and they figured why not try out for the circus. The Dingaling Brothers Varnum and Vincent Circus always came around.  They figured they would try-out for the circus, but the line was too long. There were all kinds of people in the line bearded old ladies, mustached young tramps, a lady made of chocolate named Coquinda but they called her Co-Co. There was even a white man named Ritz in the line with the butt of his pants cut out, telling racist jokes.   Needless to say the competition was stiff, so Rudy and Peephole thought of something different. They waited til the elephants were moving off stage during the show, and they ran onto the stage. Peephole on his harmonica, and Rudy doing his jitterbug, they even found a unicycle for Peephole and took turns on the harmonica. This nigga-squirrel combo took off like a rocket dipped in fishgrease. The Brothers Dingaling immediately signed them, and loved the way they ran out the crowd to perform.  "It was sheer genious, like a combination of Albert Einstein and Sir Francis Dooling mashed into one potato".   Well that concludes this week's edition of the Magical World of Lou Jackson.  Who knows what he will uncover next time.  It's like a jungle some time it makes me wonder how Junebug hustles undercover.        "The Coca-Cola All-Stars" By Salvador Gabor   The Rayful Edmonds'/Richard Porter "Traveling Coke All Stars", sponsored by Coca-Cola announced the captains for the starting line-up yesterday. Defensive coordinator Butch Reed, a Detroit native, announced that Linebacker Lawrence Taylor and Defensive End Dexter Manley would be Co-Captains for the defensive squad. "I needed older, wiser, veteran-like players to lead this defensive team".   On the offensive side, Alberto Martinez, the offensive coordinator decided that youth would be the way to go with choosing captains. Running Back Ricky Williams, who was traded from the "Garcia Vega GREEN Wave" was introduced as a Co-Captain on offense. But, in a SHOCKING move, newly acquired quarterback Quincy Carter was introduced as the second captain for the offensive squad.    Stay Tuned for more details on the upcoming "Traveling Coke All Stars" tour. For more info call Ruby Taylor at 301-455-3534

       Cookout Etiquette: Chapters 23-27  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.      Yeah I know Cookout Season has been in full swing for a little while now, but there are certain things that I have to get off my chest. As many of us in the 23-27 year old age group, we are in the changing age group as far as cookouts are concerned.  It is kind of like when you stop sitting at the kiddie table at Thanksgiving but, it is so much deeper. Take a journey with me, but don't stray because this jungle is deep, and those vines might be alive.   Couples:  Let me break this down in sections. You have many different types of couples who show up at cookouts, but allow me to focus in the specified age group.  The big "hungry" girl and her boyfriend who loves her to death.  Now I may have thrown you off with "hungry".  This girl isn't hungry for ribs like Rodrick "the Ribbler" Tidwell aka "RibTips", she is hungry for love and/or lust. She is in the yard rubbernecking and look-a-whoing to the point, where her prey even knows, hell her man even knows. Have some etiquette about yourself Kanella, you could have left Craig at home if you are going to act like that.   There is the very attractive and/or not-so attractive girl with the overprotective dude. Oh man these guys are the worst. These fellas either know people are looking or THINK people are looking at their lady. The type of guy pressed to put his arm around his lady, not because he feels that strongly for his woman, but because he feels threatened or feels the need to show off his prized possession. Nigga clutch your Corvette, and stop tripping. Charnice went to school with Dewey and Keith, they just got more personality than you do.   Workers: Now in order for a cookout to be successful, someone must sacrifice and work at the cookout. Now many of us in the specified age range aren't really used to this. We are just getting accustomed to bringing beer to the party for strangers to consume. Now whether it's Bobby or Julian who gets on the grill, you must have had proper training.  By proper training I mean, USE BBQ sauce. I have been to 2 cookouts hosted by people in my age group and neither had BBQ sauce. What is a BBQ without BBQ sauce? That is like having a pool party without a pool, a concert without Mystikal and only his mother singing songs next to the DJ booth. Now maybe I am serious about BBQ sauce, which I am, but we as the young up-and-coming grillers in Black Backyards Across America must step up to the plate, now I am not saying you have to make your own, but get that Sweet Baby Ray's.   The Bunk: Oh they arrive at different times, each group rationing off their influence in their specific time frame. The pretty girls arrive at different times.  There is one group who is already there, and you think "hmm they got a few lookers". Surely they are to be outstaged by the 5 o'clock crew, they show up a little late, and they look better than the first. They steal Melissa and 'ems fire. However that 5 o'clock crew is followed by that 5:30 crew, now this is where it gets serious.  Two groups of bad joints arriving at practically the same time, and please don't let there be a pool in the yard, if that is Shayla's bikini I see up under that skirt....   Now some of the bunk arrive with intentions of getting drunk. They might not bring beer, but there are certain polite members of bunk-mafia who will leave the cookout and bring back dranks (dranks is beer and liquor for those of you ignorant to the bunk). There are also some who will show up "drawnk". This is usually a threesome of the following, one wild dude who is gonna have you laughing, a nigga who is sleep, and another nigga just chilling to the highest level of chilling (A girl sometimes arrives with them, she is usually beatifully built and handles the arts and crafts of the construction paper).   There are many other people sitting in and outside the yard.  Some for decoration and others with a purpose.  Make sure you are aware of those things that go on at cookouts, whether they are Yuckmouth sitting on his car with the heat, or ole Tasha drunk off Smirnoff selling fish sandwiches.  Cookout season is in full swing, and for any info please check www.ebonycookouts.com and call (301) 455-3534, ask for Niles or Ethel Womack.

       Sal's Corner "The Barbershop"    Everybody's been in a barbershop. Either that or you've seen the movie. But, I dont wanna talk about the "stereotypical" black barbershop stuff that we ALL know. Let's go a lil deeper.   * I know yall know that dude who asks for his hair to be cut like the dude wo just got up out the seat. "Yeah, make mines JUST like his". What he dont know is the other dude has a WAY better grain of hair than him. Forget all that "aint no such things as good hair". YES IT IS and that dude DOESNT have it. So why is he always tryna be like the dude who just got up out the chair   * The one dude who's hair looks the same as it did before he came in the shop. He ALWAYS is before you too. WASTING your time. But, sometimes he goes in the back room to get his haircut. Yall know, the old man that cuts all the old people haircuts. They in a whole nother room. Dude come back out and everybody be puzzled. "Did Mr. Utley EVEN he cut his joant this week?"   * The retarded kids bus that comes once every 3 months. All yall barbers, YALL ARE WRONG. Yall do them boys dirty. Run the clippers over their head ONE time. The "B.A. Baracus" joant. Looking like the "Mr. T fan club" when they walk out.    * The dude wit da pink bumps on the back of his neck. Look like stuck some bubble yum on his neck. His neck look like he just kept some gum back there for a few months, and he takes it off and chew it just to grab some of the flavor out of it every once and a while. Now I dont like getting my haircut after him. Unless you gotta smart barber. Your barber can be real slick wit it. He'll make "bubble tape neck" laugh. Laugh so much that he dont notice that the barber is changing clipper guards. Yeah he gotta whole different set of clippers for "Juicy Fruit".    * The lady who gets her neck faded. She SWARE she down wit da fellas. Just cause you be pressed to come in on Friday's and get your neck touched dont mean you trump tight wit da fellas. She jump in the convo and think she know the deal. Let me tell you something, go on and get your eye's lashed and you neck faded and get on. Always wanna bring the women's perspective. If I wanted that, I'd watch Oprah. This is grown men talk here.   * The dude who cant cut. He never has NO customers. No steady clientele. No nothing. He just reads "Ebony" all day. He can tell you the "top 10 couples of the year" since 1988. He can recite week by week the "JET" beauty of the weeks from the year 1991. And he be begging for work. Let a dude come in there and not know the deal and walk NEAR his seat........."I can getchu". Thats the sorry dude's favorite line "Come on over here and let me getchu". Not the kid I say.........NOT THE KID. I asked for an "even" and he giving out "cleveland's". I dont want no shag in the back! Where they do that at? I dont care if your barber aint there, keep it scraggly.   * The "Salesmen". See most of yall think of the dude who sells walkmen, kid's movies, CD's and video games. Everybody knows him. He's cool. But I aint talking bout him. Im talking bout the dude who sells PORNO's ONLY. Like.........for real........ if I was EVEN interested in buying one.......how I look buying one of them from you in FRONT of all these dudes in the shop? His best sales would be on the way OUT the shop. How I look holding a "Debbie does Dallas" DVD for an hour while im waiting on a cut. And you know when you buy something from the "Salesmen", everybody wanna look!    * The "Quiet" moment. This usually occurs when one of the following happens. 1) Somebody says something real stupid, 2) The dude who cant cut gets a customer, or 3) When somebody's GOOD-LOOKING Mamma comes in. All of a sudden the convo dont mean as much no more. Raise your hand if you want the mother to get up and personally instruct the barber on how to cut her son's hair?   * Last but not least....... "The African Dude". No, not like the movie where there was an African barber. Im talking about an African Patron. He comes in every week. Nobody knows where he came from or how he heard about the shop. He walks out every week and somebody asks "Who is that?" The barber at the end says "Oh.....that's my main man Muke', dude is cool, he dont say much but Muke' is cool." He think he fly too. He grabs the mirror like 10 times. Rubbing his chin, making faces in the mirror. He usually got on tight jeans and slide-ons wit no socks. DEFINITELY no neck fade. He either boxes the neck out or its a slight shag. Just a SLIGHT Shag people. Not quite "Randy Watson" but more "Lou Rawls". Lil fake coogi sweater, either that or a "members only" jacket. Whatever he's a member of, im a stay clear of that.    "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin"

       News & Notes  By Reggie Dinkins, Jr.            Francis "Franco" Ballot was cut from the Dupont Circle Skate Club last Tuesday. The team cited several reasons for the assistant coordinator of team spirit timely departure. It was believed that "Franco" was trying to incorporate props into the Skate Club's annual production of "Duck Duck Goose Me" the musical. There were allegations that Franco wanted to use gerbals and hamsters for the production's big finish. However, Trip Philson and Chris Kansas, were opposed to such a stunt.  Needless to say they made a pickle over it. Franco Ballot was last seen in Fresh Fields buying a pack of organic hot dogs.        Dr. Willie Leak, seen above at the Home Schooled Dentist Conference, has decided not to press charges against an unknown woman, named Beulatese Finks, who alleges Dr. Willie leaked on her shoe outside a HSDC function last Tuesday. Dr. Willie was going to press charges against the alleged Finks for slander and farting up his reputation. Ms. Finks was not available for comment, but was recorded at the Boney James concert stating "I'll kick Dr. Willie in his willie the next time I see that lying rascal, gonna piss on me, who does he think he is?". Her good girlfriend Phyllis also said that Beulahtese won't press charges but might drop-kick the good Dr. if she sees him getting out that old Mercedes.       "Strictly Bidness"  By Salvador Gabor    Does making a lil money on the side interest you? How about the possibility of having multiple streams of income? What about being able to retire from your job? How about firing your boss? Well if these things sound good, UPH&RA may be the resource for you.   The Uptown Pimpin' Hustlin' & Robbin' Association is looking to branch out across the D.C. Area into parts of Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina as well. The UPH&RA, which was founded on 13th & Park Road in N.W. D.C. is an organization dedicated to giving constituents of Corporate America a chance to sell rocks, rob niggas, and get on this pimpin' during the after hours. Why come home and work in your garden when you can sell green on the streets? Why have intimate time with your wife, when you can help other women sell their bodies on the street? Your wife can wait a few hours.......surely she can. What about having your boss sign your check........then you turn around and rob him for his? Now that's a salary increase for ya!   Some of you will NEVER have another opportunity like this. Imagine sitting on the toilet and MAKING MONEY. I know some of you say, "There's no WAY you can make money sitting on a toilet?". Well if the Police come and you have to swallow some "product", sitting on the toilet may be your ONLY way of making that sell!   We have weekly meetings that rotate from 15th & Monroe to 14th & Kenyon all the way back to 13th & Park Road. We have also aligned ourselves with many Uptown Hispanic Gangs. We are looking to do a joint venture on "Knife Work as a tool for Self-Protection". Other topics such as "Private Business Receptions and/or Presentations to knewly acquired Whores, Crackheads and weed addicts". Real meaty topics and discussions will take place. Also on August 21, 2004, our VP of Sales, Henry "Bo-Skeeta" Johnson will discuss ideas for 2005 and will moderate breakout sessions for intermediate level pimps and pushers. Please register now for that event, which will be held at the Petworth Recreational Center on 8th & Taylor Streets, N.W.. This will truly be a blessed affair. Not often will you get a chance to be in the presence of a man such as "Bo-Skeeta". Come one, Come all, it's promised to be a grand affair.   You guys already know who to contact. Mrs. Ruby Taylor will be manning the lines. Call her at (301) 455-3534. If she is not available, ask for "Slim". Better know as "8-Track Slim".

       Sal's Corner "Before you die"    We all gotta go. Face it, life dont last always. Im prepared for death. At least two people know my email password, so that if I die, they can continue to send out Sal's Corner. This stuff im talking about is priceless and lifelong. You can read this stuff in 2082 and still can apply it to your own life. (Yeah Im feeling myself a lil too much) But yeah, before you die you gotta LIVE LIFE. And here's what you do   *You gotta ride in the back of your own car before you die.  Now some of us have been in the back of our car but thats ANOTHER STORY (if you know what I mean). But I mean, you in the back preferably by yourself with two people in the front. Ive done that and its great, I mean great. My homie was driving and whenever we got to where we got, I felt like a star getting out of the car. Even though the car is older than some of the readers of this article, it felt good. Riding shotgun in your own car is cool too. Especially when you see a person you know and they walk up to the car window. You can roll it down slightly and just talk crazy. Just play SO big.   *You gotta ride in a limo in a situation OTHER than a funeral or a wedding!  Rent a limo for your birthday! Rent a limo cause you hit the number in the corner store for $100. Rent a limo if you getta pink slip on yo' job. Just rent one once   Sidebar:  Dont you hate when people argue about who's gonna ride in or who shoulda rode in the family car at the funeral? Maybe its just me   *You gotta walk Butt-Naked in your house.  I havent done this and cant come to grips with doing it but its so necessary. I dont even walk barefoot in my house so I know butt-naked is gonna be a major accomplishment for me. I just be scared that Im a bump into something and damage my goods. Ya know...........you might close the refrigerator door and close "yourself" in the door as well.   *Fellas, you gotta have a BAD female admiring you from afar.  I mean she gotta have a mean crush on you and you not even know. I mean, SHE dont even know why, she just feelin you. I aint had that happen to me, but if any ladies feel that way about me..... sallimo@hotmail.com   ....... Hit me! I would give you my cell phone but it might be cut off next week   Sidetip:  Never save the number of a DC person under 25 in your phonebook. If they are truly DC resident and they are under 25 they dont keep phones long man!   *Ladies, you gotta have a man serenade you in front of your female friends.  Notice I said "A MAN" not "Your man". That aint nothing to have YOUR man do it. When he is YOUR man he almost feel like he gotta do it. Sometimes YALL are the ones who plan it......"ok now honey, I want you to come in the beauty parlor at precisely 6:00 with the flowers. I should be under the dryer then, so I'll be in the back, just ask KIM or TANGY to come get me and i'll come out with a surprised look on my face"   *People, you gotta get married.  Dont be 60 years old and be still having your friends hooking you up with their brothers/sisters. You cant even be intimate at that age without taking some pill that has you "on guard" for 36 HOURS!. When you get married at 60, Intimacy is standing close when taking pictures. The honeymoon is watching Family Feud.   *Last but not least you gotta accept Jesus Christ in ya life.  Now there are Millions of religions. Im not pushing mines on anyone. We all have an open choice. So If you Muslim, a Jehovah's Witness, or you just religiously watch NFL Games on Sunday, take this one how you like it. I wont argue wit you about who is right and who is wrong. We can do it like Jeopardy, write down your own answer but in the end we will know. None of us are perfect but Jesus loves you despite all of that. Plus Southeast DC aint got nothing on the Heat in Hell!   What more can I say "Lord Willin, Rome Feelin". Im out like a homeless man's toe in a shoe.
