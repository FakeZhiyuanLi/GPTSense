      Well, back again...Thanks Kim for getting me hooked on this site!  All I have to say is MOON MAN!  LOL Liz...i have a cartoon for him too!   Here are some funny lines I really just came up with at the moment: 1. WOW!, they really planned this! 2. Now, they would never understand because they ARE crazier then you! 3. How dare you insult Madame Butterfly (FYI: I was a little crazy and I rapped myself in the Twister® game board(you know the mat)and was pretending I was a butterfly...my parents WERE NOT amused)

      Well. The simple truth that I have come to is that people who believe that they are right because it is in the bible are never going to change.  I was talking to some people today (that will remain name less) kept saying that being gay was "wrong".  They said that people who are gay would go to hell.  Which brings up my point, if you were going to go to hell for being gay then wouldn't you want to have the best possible life here, on earth?  And, 50 years ago black people couldn't marry white people.  Now interatial marriages are a common site...so why souldn't gay marriages be too? Remember.   Speak you mind. But your mind is not always correct. And remember. To bend!

      Guess What!  Yesterday I spent my entire day coloring our wood floor.  You wonder why?  Well we got our living room painted and new rugs put in as well.  But the rugs didn't cover some really long skratches so, when my parents went to the Rug Store I got my box of Crayola® Crayons and started to color.  I am so pround of myself because you can barely see any of the skratches!  :-)  But I am so bored today....snore....I am so happy the Academy Awards are on today....

      Well back again.  And all I can think is how pathetic I am.  I mean people always say I look older than a freshman so I am all like: Why don't I get the respect.  I mean my dad doesn't push my grandma around and my mom doesn't...well actually it is all my dad...sometimes I wish my parents were divorced.  I know it is all horriable to think that but it is true!  I mean I know it would be all bad and junk and my mom would be all depresed and she would have to work and all but still.  Another thought: How come all the books in the library made from Teens are _Lucy has a Problem with cutting_ seriously.  No happy junk.  But then again, my life is far from happy so there is no reason to get all depresed because someone has a better life....................

      Well hello again.  I feel like making a list of...*I've got it* Why I Hate My Life! 1. ILS IS NOT CHALLENGING>>but the tests would make Albert E. cry! 2. No one thinks I am a freshman...they all think i look like a senior...here i come Oil of Olay Wrinkle Creme! 3. I have to run the mile tomorrow. 4. I live in the only state that makes GYM manditory. 5. My best friend is my dog. 6. Followed by Animal Crackers. 7. I write stories and no one who can publish them has read any of them. 8. I am a expect on Mac computers and no one else knows about them 9. Orlando is cute.... 10. Um, i feel very random right now...bye.

      The Listen Girl    No one ever listens to me. But, sometimes no one will let me be. I try to listen and to dream But everyone ends up being mean  It’s not fair I shout to the sky. But, everyone replies it is a lie. I cuddle in a ball and stare Out at the thin cold air  I am always a friend in the end Everyone comes to talk to me and bend How there lives are horrible and long And I reply in a helpful song  I say they are worth living, don’t cry But, my heart gives a sigh If only I had someone to listen to me How happy I would be.

      Figuring out the Foerch gene pool  	While recently searching the web, I found out Mr. Foerch’s email…It is very interesting because in his profile for Yahoo! it says that he is divorced.  That got me thinking.  Scenario 1: 	Mrs. Foerch had a daughter when she was previously married.  Then, she met Mr. Foerch who had one son before.  Then they together got married and had another son who is in 8th grade.  Scenario 2: 	Mrs. Foerch had a daughter when she was previously married.  Then, she met Mr. Foerch who had two sons before.  Scenario 3: 	Mr. Foerch accidentally put that he was divorced in his profile.    Fact: 	Mr. Foerch said, during class, that he had two children. 	Mrs. Foerch mentioned a girl and maybe the other child/girl.

      Wednesday June 3, 4:00 pm, Pool 	We are at the pool and guess who’s here.  Tammy showed up with Natalie!  I knew we should have come here when school was still in session.  Joan is now pressuring me to get in the pool and splash her.  I am all “no” because then Natalie will get all-mad because her precious hair will get wet.  God!  You’re in a pool.  What to expect will happen to your hair?  A perm?  God.  I hate teenage girls!  Thursday June 4, 5:00 pm, Home 	School is over.  Yippy.  Monday June 8, 12:00 pm, Library 	I cannot believe Joan talked me into doing this.  Mom was so happy when she drove me to the library.  She was all “Oh I am so happy you are letting something that has authority and value influence your life”.  I was all “Joan is making me, Mom”.   	She isn’t even here yet.  SHE IS LATE!  Mom asked if I wanted to make a “fashionably-late entrance”.  I said “no” THINKING that Joan would be here first. 	Well this gives me time to write about all the stuff that happened in the past four days.  As you know, June 3 was my birthday.  I wish I could be like all other girls and say, “Joan took me out and we went clubbin’ but I cannot say that.  I did, however, stay at home and eat cake.  Mom bought me a cell phone because Natalie had one.  Moms are so pathetic.  Another thing that happened was that we got a letter from Dad.  He wrote the letter on a piece of cardboard.  It said:  	DEAR LAURA, NATALIE, JACK, TRUDY, AND OF COURSE DANNI 		I CANNOT SAY WHERE I AM…AGAIN.  HOWEVER, I CAN SAY THAT I AM WELL.  I THINK THAT WHAT YOU SAID IN THE OTHER LETTER IS CORRECT; WE SHOULD REPAINT THE LIVING ROOM.  I HOPE THAT EVERYONE IS DOING OK, SCHOOL-WISE AND NORMALLY.  I AM SORRY TO MISS THE GIRLS BIRTHDAYS…AGAIN.  WHEN I GET BACK, WE WILL CELEBRATE AND I DON’T CARE IF IT IS IN DECEMBER.  MY LOVE GOES OUT TO YOU ALL.  					LOVE- DAD.  	I miss him so much.  Monday June 8, 12:04 pm, Library 	Man, I fazed out there for a moment.  It is so nice that school is over.  Woops.  Joan is here.  I must prepare myself for torture.  Monday June 8, 8:09 pm, my room 	The meeting went fine.  I was really board.  Nevertheless, I have to go again Wednesday.  Tomorrow I will study the chess book I got from the library.  I think I’m going to hit the hay right now; I don’t feel so good.  Tuesday June 9, 4:45 am, my room 	I fell feel so sick.  I can’t get out of bed.  Why me?  Why?  I went to the meeting and I was nice.  Why me?  Tuesday June 9, 12:52 pm, my room 	Mom wants me to keep a temperature chart.  She now thinks that I should be in control of it.  When I was sleeping, every hour she would check my temp until I almost swallowed the thermometer and woke up choking.  4:50 am- 100.4 ˚F 5:50 am- 99.9 ˚F 6:50 am- 100.3 ˚F 7:50 am- 100.4 ˚F 8:50 am- 100.2 ˚F 9:50 am-100.3 ˚F 10:50 am- 100.0 ˚F 11:50 am- 98.9 ˚F 12:50 pm- 101.0 ˚F ~I took Motrin.  Tuesday June 9, 2:00 pm, in the car driving back from the doctors 	Mom has taken me to the doctors because I can get better if I am at a place that sees millions of sick kids a hour.  (I was being sarcastic) 	Wait.  I knew that person who just passed by the waiting room.  Well, what do you know, that was Cute-Hot Doctor.  HE MOVED UP.  Good for him. 	“Ms. Marski?” 	I get up. 	“Doctor Steve Kolms will see you now.” 	Oh, my god!  Cute-Hot Doctor is going to see me sick…again!  How pathetic am I?  I can see our wedding now.  A fellow co-worker of Steve stands up to make his “I’m the best friend, I’m drunk, and I’m hoping to score with the bridesmaids speech”.  “I first met Danni when she was hit on the head with a soccer ball.  I was one of the other Nurses who handed her a gown, and then Steve walked in.  He didn’t know that he would marry her.  He just wanted to treat her and then go home.  Her family didn’t seem so nice, especially when Danni threatened me as she stuck out her tongue.  But they seem like the perfect couple who cannot see enough of each other.”   	“Right in here, Ms. Marski.” 	I cannot believe that my legs are moving.  I AM SO EMBARRASSED! 	“Mom, can you come in with me?”   	“Sure”.  She replies. 	There is a knock on the door. 	“May I come in?”  Asks a familiar voice. 	“Yes.”  Mom replies. 	He walks in.  Looks at my chart and says, “Welcome back”.  	Me:  Um, yeah.  	Cute-Hot Doctor Steve:  So, what is it today?  	I feel like a moron.  	Me:  I am sick  	Mom:  (handing CHDS my temp chart) She is kind-of delusional.  	CHDS:  Don’t worry.  All we need to do is a simple blood-test.  	Me:  A simple what? 	 	CHDS:  We need to take some blood to see what is wrong with you, Ms. Marski. 	 	Me:  Yeah.  I am sick!  I have a fever!  I have and need all the blood I’ve got!  	CHDS:  I promise it will be quick…  	Me:  Quick!  Quick!  I don't care if it is quick!  You are still taking some of my blood by sticking a needle in my arm!  	CHDS:  Now calm down.  It will be alright…  	Me:  I think you have me mistaken… 	 	I sound like a person who is in a play or musical.  	Me:  I don’t swing that way.  Take a hair sample!  Take a nail scraping! (props to Joan for teaching me all the forensic terms)  Just, you won’t be taking any blood out of me!  	CHDS:  We need to!  You could be very ill…  	Me:  (I didn’t let him finish)  So I will die ill!!!!!!  	CHDS:  (Looking at Mom)  What should we do now?  	Mom:  (Looking right back at Doctor Steve)  You’re the doctor.  	CHDS:  (Now looking at me)  Ms. Marski… 	 	Me:  (I didn’t let him finish again)  It’s Danni!  And my name will not be on a tube of blood!  	CHDS:  I will have to call in another doctor.  	Me:  Then call him!  Call him!  	CHDS presses a button and two men come in.  These men are big.  These men are strong.  And these men are FAT!  	CHDS:  Jim…  Dan…  I need some help.  	Then they start to all advance on me.  CHDS is the one with the needle.  Mom gets in on the action too.  She screams, “If she bites you don’t sue me!” 	I panic.  But I have no where to go.  So, I run under CHDS’s desk.  But the men are too strong; they pull me out and strap me to a table.  I remember tasting flesh but I don’t remember whose.  I didn’t survive like she sings in the song.  I surrendered. 	All the way out of the office, I made a big deal of how much I hurt.  I rubbed the place where they took the blood and yelleped and screamed.  They may have won the battle but I won the war!

All we need to do is a simple blood-test.     Me:  A simple what?              CHDS:  We need to take some blood to see what is wrong with you, Ms. Marski.                  Me:  Yeah.  I am sick!  I have a fever!  I have and need all the blood I’ve got!     CHDS:  I promise it will be quick…   Me:  Quick!  Quick!  I don't care if it is quick!  You are still taking some of my blood by sticking a needle in my arm!      CHDS:  Now calm down.  It will be alright…         Me:  I think you have me mistaken…           I sound like a person who is in a play or musical.       Me:  I don’t swing that way.  Take a hair sample!  Take a nail scraping! (props to Joan for teaching me all the forensic terms)  Just, you won’t be taking any blood out of me!     CHDS:  We need to!  You could be very ill…        Me:  (I didn’t let him finish)  So I will die ill!!!!!!      CHDS:  (Looking at Mom)  What should we do now?        Mom:  (Looking right back at Doctor Steve)  You’re the doctor.       CHDS:  (Now looking at me)  Ms. Marski…                  Me:  (I didn’t let him finish again)  It’s Danni!  And my name will not be on a tube of blood!    CHDS:  I will have to call in another doctor.         Me:  Then call him!  Call him!   CHDS presses a button and two men come in.  These men are big.  These men are strong.  And these men are FAT!          CHDS:  Jim…  Dan…  I need some help.         Then they start to all advance on me.  CHDS is the one with the needle.  Mom gets in on the action too.  She screams, “If she bites you don’t sue me!”        I panic.  But I have no where to go.  So, I run under CHDS’s desk.  But the men are too strong; they pull me out and strap me to a table.  I remember tasting flesh but I don’t remember whose.  I didn’t survive like she sings in the song.  I surrendered.         All the way out of the office, I made a big deal of how much I hurt.  I rubbed the place where they took the blood and yelleped and screamed.  They may have won the battle but I won the war!

      Monday June 1, 10:00 am, Study Hall 	I HATE ENGLISH.  Well I really hate all classes right now.  Today our grades are posted and are final for this marking period.  English includes the test on the Voc that I got a 63% on.  English: C (because on the Voc) Math: B (I just don’t care) Spanish: C (Yo estupido) ILS: A (He never teaches) Gym: C (stupid presidential fitness thing I failed) Creative: A (we only get tested on participation)  Therefore, all together, my GPA is a 2.8 out of 4.0!!!!!!!!!!!!!  {Only three More Days Left of School}  Tuesday June 2, 10:00 am, Study Hall 	I absolutely hate my life!  Not only is today Natalie’s birthday; but also Anna and Robert are coming over.  Mom and Dad are friends with their parents but I absolutely hate their family.  Anna is into Gymnastics and Robert is all “Goosebumps” books.  Along with all of that, they all have this unreal correlation with Garfield Comics.  They are always saying stuff like “Garfield hates Mondays too, but he never had homework…well I guess he had homework of catching mice…John always told him to, but that Garfield was just too darn stubborn.” 	Anna is bad alone too!  She only talks about Gymnastics and when we went over to their house once, she showed me 3 hours worth of vaults, dancing, and falls.  I wish I could have shot myself.  Jack even plain out asked if there was something wrong with Robert, right to his face.  We never bring Jack anymore.  I wish I had said that.  Tuesday June 2, 6:45 pm, Home 	Wow.  I have no free time because Anna, Robert, and their parents are over.  Natalie is so lucky.  She got a gold necklace from Mom (and Dad), Anna gave her a DVD of Save the Last Dance, and Anna’s parents and Robert gave her a cell phone! 	Oops, pizza is here.  Must go!  Tuesday June 2, 10:20 pm, Home 	I am so mad.  I cannot believe how mad I am.  I HATE NATALIE.  I HATE HER SO MUCH!  DIE!  DIE!  DIE! 	She knows my birthday is tomorrow!  So knows I will get presents!  Nevertheless, she just had to spend the whole night telling everyone why her new cell phone is the greatest. 	Along with that, she invited, guess who, over.  Tammy!  Therefore, for like four hours Tammy and I were sharing oxygen.  I wish I could have asked her about the site but I could never steer the conversation there.  {Only two More Days Left of School}  Wednesday June 3, 7:45 am, Gym 	We are at a pep-rally for the end of school.  I hate pep-rallies.  It is just 3 hours of “what you could be if you were a) Beautiful b) Smart c) Athletic d) Talented e) Useful f) Popular g) Creative and h) Not me” 	I was supposed to wear my uniform today and stand with the freshman soccer team when they called out our names but I didn’t.  I have “unofficially” quit.  I know it is the end of the season but I am not going to the camp that everyone on the team has to go to.  Joan sat with me during the assembly and “ooded” and “ahhhed” at the cheerleaders, dancers, and musicians.  I sat there finishing my homework for Spanish.  Tener Forms:  1. yo tengo unos zapatos.  Joan:  Hey, who is that?  2. nosotros tenemos tarea  Me:  What is a perro?  Joan:  A dog.  For that problem, it would be a black dog… See perro negro.  Perro means dog and negro means black.  Me:  Ok, ok, I get it!  3. ella tiene un perro negro  Me:  Oh, that is Max Fillips.  He is a sophomore.    Joan:  He is cute, he’s a sophomore… I wonder if he has a girlfriend?  4. Josè tiene un suèter  Me:  Really, I have no clue about the whole girlfriend thing.  Write about you.  Yo tengo muchos zapatos y suèters.  Yo tengo un papa y un mama.  Yo tengo la hermana.  Mi mama tiene las gemelas.  Natalie y Danielle son los nombres.  Yo Danni.  Joan:  God, he is so buff.  Me:  I am sure he is on steroids  Joan:  I know, but he is still cute, he looks like…  Me:  Who?  Joan:  Well he looks like Mr. Grams…  Me:  No way!  Mr. Grams is older and a teacher and…  Joan:  I am saying he looks like him if Mr. Grams was younger.  Me:  Still the whole school is on steroids.  And now, here are the Middleton High School boys’ gymnastics teams… (Loud pop-dance-hip/hop music plays) ØWe need help to find a dream, da da da, we need help, da da da da…Ø  Me:  Who is that? (I point to a figure)  Joan:  Are you done with your homework?  Me:  Yeah…who is that?  Joan:  That is Jamie.  Me:  He is so cute.  Joan:  He is in theatre and gymnastics and has that nickname of Olivo.  Me:  Why?  Joan:  I don’t know but I think he was in a play where he played someone named Oliver.  That is just a guess though.  Me:  Yeah…  Joan:  Hey, what about Brian?  Me:  What about him?  Joan:  I thought he was your male fantasize-ation.  Me:  Um, no.  Joan:  Well I know that Olivo has or had a girlfriend.  Me:  Great.  Joan:  Well, you have had a boyfriend right?  Me:  Oh, yeah, of course, Natalie had one and I have/had one too….  Joan:  I’ve never had one either.  Me:  What is it like?  I mean, people with boyfriends don’t change physically.  Joan:  I think it is all-emotional.  Me:  I think it is all a bunch of crap.  Joan:  What do you mean?  Here are your girls’ freshman soccer team.  Janelle Abrams.   Kim Fens.  Henna Gee.  Manilla Gplios.  Anita Levens.  Danni Mar--.   Natalie Marski.  Joan:  Ha, you showed them!  Me:  (laughing) yeah!  Hey, wanna go to the pool after this?  Joan:  You mean leave school?  Me:  Yeah.  Joan:  But what about calling in?  Me:  There is only today and tomorrow left of school…what can they do?  Joan:  But you have been expelled…they have you red-flagged…  Me:  Fine.  We will stay in school.  Then we will go to the pool.  Joan:  Alright, call me after you get home.  Me:  God, they look so stupid…  Joan:  Who?  Me:  The chess club… they have matching shirts…  Joan:  Let’s join…  Me:  What?  Joan:  Come on, we can get all the geeks to attack Tammy and her cronies.  Me:  You’re crazy.  We cannot be seen with them.  Look.  There is Miv Simpson.  Wow.  She isn’t wearing her black eye-shadow and French designer clothes!  Joan:  What’s up with her anyway?  Me:  She is really nice.  She just doesn’t care what other people think of her.  Joan:  I wanna meet her.  Let’s join Chess Club!  Me:  I have no clue how to play.  Joan:  So.  We will learn.  I hear chess can teach you how to plan battles.  Tammy is one reason to join.  Me:  Fine.  But if it gets weird in the first week, I quit.  Joan:  Okay.  I hear they meet at the library every Monday and Wednesday from 12:00 noon to 3:00 pm.  Me:  Fine.

      Monday May 25, 8:12 pm, Hospital 	God, I am such a freak!  I mean everyone saw, even Brian!  Here’s what happened. 	I play soccer for Middleton High School and am NOT good at it.  The only reason I joined was because of Dean Hapgus!  She saw that I was not in any extracurricular activities and somehow I joined soccer.  Oh, how I loathe Dean Hapgus!  I wish I could just kick a soccer ball in her ugly face…  However, I AM NOT GOOD AT SOCCER!  So, I would just miss and she would give me a detention and Mom would freak out and… 	Anyway, we were in a game and tied 0-0.  Mom was on the sidelines cheering for Natalie.  She is such a great Mom, I mean her two twin daughters are playing against an extremely hard team and she has to cheer for just one daughter!  Natalie is good at soccer, Natalie has medals, Natalie has a place on the Varsity team… and me, I just need this to graduate. 	To make things worse Brian, star captain of the football team was there. 	Okay, so here is what happened. 	Trish had the ball and was moving towards the goal on the left side.  I was standing on the right, next to the goal, looking at the oddly shaped clouds.  Then one thing leads to another and Trish passes the ball to me.  I had no idea that she would do that so I kind of, kind of ducked.  I know that is the one rule that Coach Frate stresses with me not to do but it was instinct.  The only problem was that Natalie was right behind me (in case I screwed up) and kicked the ball right at me.  This time I didn’t duck in time.  I passed out! 	So now, I am sitting here in the hospital in a cheap and crappy hospital gown wishing I could have just been in book club. 	Luckily, Natalie hasn’t stopped by.  I know it is stupid to be mad at Natalie.  Just because she caused me to pass out is no reason to be mad at her.  Ha!  She is doomed to wedgies and bubble baths.  Let me explain the bubble baths.  The best way to get back at someone who is obsessed with his or her hair is to fill his or her hair care product with bubble bath.  *IT WORKS*   	Anyway, the only upside to this “visit” is that I get to miss school tomorrow because “Cute-Hot Doctor” thinks I need to be monitored.  He is really a nurse but doctors are so much hotter then nurses, especially male nurses.  I mean every male doctor on Scrubs or er is hot.  Oh, er, how hot your doctors are.  God I sound like Yoda from Star Wars!  Maybe sleep good do me.  Ah!  Tuesday May 26, 10:20 am, Hospital 	Hospitals are depressing 	Man, I watched this movie on the Hallmark channel and it evolved a girl falling off a cliff.  She is saved but when she is in the hospital, flowers from everyone arrive.  In my room, there is only one bouquet of flowers and it is from the person who was last in this room!  Still I water it and give it the stuff the florists put in with your flowers; that plant junk. 	Anyway, today is my last day in the hospital.  Therefore, I only have like two hours left with Steve (AKA “Cute-Hot Doctor).  I really don’t want to go home.  I mean everyone at the hospital thinks I am just Danni.  Not “the twins” or “Natalie”.  Well actually, they call me Danielle because that’s what it says on my chart. 	Jack visited today.  He is my aunt Trudy’s son.  We watch him from time to time because Trudy is a little…out there.  If my opinion mattered, I would say that Jack is a little out there.  When he came to my room, the only thing he wanted to do was climb into my bed.  I was fine with him just sitting on the side like my mom does but he wanted ME OUT and himself IN.  I was all like, um NO!  He of course did the whole screaming tantrum thing.  When he left, he stuck his tongue out at me.  Well, I just stuck it back and then realized that Steve was right there!  He just gave me a weird look and said “Can I help you out of bed?”   	People at school I know are going to be all over me.  There will be no sympathy.  Believe me!  Everyone will be like, “Hey, Danni, watch out, did I step on your toe?”  But, I will survive!  Da-Da-Da-Da.  God, I love that song!  Anyway, I know I will have a ton of homework.  Stupid teachers.  One of my teachers once had an operation during the school year and she STILL gave homework!  I really don’t want to go to school either.  I mean my study hall is filled with Brian and people who were at the game and people who know Natalie.  Why can’t I just be out of high school?  Fourteen is such a cruel age.  Thirty is the awesome age; you are mature (sort of), good looking (if you’re a movie star) and HAVE A BOYFRIEND (if you’re normal).  However, sadly I am and have none of those things. 	Oops, I got to go.  The hospital people are all mad because Mom is not here yet to take me home and…  Tuesday May 26, 8:45 pm, Home 	At home again.  I really need to find out if anyone knows what happened.  I know.  E-Mailing.  Nevermind: Hey, what did I miss at school? Crime_Reader: Nothing, except that Hilary Buffward was caught will pot on school grounds.  Hey, where were you yesterday? Nevermind: Um, you didn’t hear? Crime_Reader: No. Nevermind: I was at the Crime_Reader: Hey, sorry to interrupt but Natalie just signed on and I have to ask her a question.  Bye for now.  See you tomorrow.  	Can you see how great my friends are?  Well, at least Gina didn’t know what happened but she will when she is done talking to Natalie.  Wednesday May 27, 9:00 am, Gym 	God, I am in so much trouble!  I sort of was late getting to gym because of Janelle Fabens.  She just kept asking me all of these questions in the hall as I was making my way to gym and I sort of got lost in the school and then had to ask a security guard how to get back to the gym.  Now I am a sitting here, after crying for 7 minutes and still haven’t found where my class is.  I swear they make this school to big.  Now I have to find my class and Brian McAddams is going to see that I have been crying and will be laughing and… 	Okay, okay, we must pull ourselves together!  Come on Danni!  This is just one more step trough life.  What if Ms. Lorteto (stupid gym teacher) yells at me!  What if…  No, Danni, no “what if”!  We must go and find our class!  One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind!  Wednesday May 27, 4:42 pm, Attendance Office 	I am so dead.  That is it; my life is over!  I see the light!  Mom is going to freak when she finds out.  However, I know that Natalie will end up telling her because Natalie knows everything.  I think she is a god or maybe a security expert that has hidden cameras around the school and at home.  At any rate, I’m doomed. 	As I sat there in the locker room wishing I wasn’t so stupid, Jamie walked in.  Jamie is a really neat person.  She wears stuff from Vogue and stuff right off the runway and she is nice to me.  This is odd because most people just call me Natalie and start talking to me about me.  I think they should have learned who is who by now but what can you do.  Anyway, when she walked in both of us were shocked.  Not only was it in-between classes but also Jamie looked terrible and I suppose I did too.   We gave each other a look and she said, “Can you help me?” This is odd because nobody asks me that.  Anyway, I said all right thinking she just had cramps and needed “feminine products” as Mom says.   However, to my surprise, Jamie said, “Can you help me get out?”  I was confused.  I mean get out of what?  We are in the basement of a highly secure school and she wants to leave?  Then she walked to this poster of “Drink Milk and It Will Save Your Bones” with Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen on the cover.  When she lifted up the tape, she unveiled a window.   “People have told me this was here and I really need it today.”  Said Jamie. “Huh?” was all I could make out I was in so much shock. “You won’t tell anyone will you?” “Where are you going?”  I asked. “Well, Shelly Fry dared me to egg Mr. Johnson’s car.” “What?” “I know I shouldn’t but if I don’t Shelly won’t forget it!” “I won’t tell.”  I said. Now I wish I had never said that because I ended up not going to gym class and now am sitting in the Attendance Office under suspicion.  Apparently, a lot of things happened when I was “skipping” gym.   1) Jamie left 2) Three fire alarms were pulled 3) Mr. Johnson’s car was egged  That all was only when I skipped gym, think of all that happened during the other gym classes!  Oh, no, they want to talk to me now.  Wednesday May 27, 10:25 am, Mom’s Car 	I HATE SCHOOL!  THERE IS NO EQUALITY HERE.  NO FAIRNESS, NO…no…ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 	Guess what?  I AM EXPELLED!  That’s right, A-student, honor roll (the lower one…but still), and soccer player.  I just burst when I was in the office of Dean Hapgus.  I mean she wasn’t even threatening, I think she even asked if I wanted a cup of water!  And that is when I shouted “Jamie escaped and I know she egged the car and…” Moreover, when you’re a Dean and you hear a confession you have to punish!   	When she called Mom, she used the professional Dean voice but when she talked to me, she was all “up-foo” 	When Mom came, you could see she was furious.  Now we are stilling in the SUV, her driving, and me in the backseat.  I really didn’t want to be “near” her during all this. 	“Use the turn signal you old bastard!”  	Now she is screaming at someone who just turned right in front of her. 	“Nice move grandpa!” 	God, just let us get home safely.   Thursday May 28, 10:31 am, my room 	Expulsions really aren’t that bad.  I mean Mom is at work all day and Natalie is at school.  The only thing that happens is that I get to spy on my neighbor.  I swear he is running a porno business.  There are always people walking in and out of his home.  Today, there was a woman who looked really “fake”, a man with a bunch of plastic flamingoes, and another man who was carrying a briefcase.  After twenty minutes of watching them, I got bored.  Maybe I will blow bubbles using the bubble wand I stole from Natalie.  Thursday May 28, 10:35 am, my room 	Well…that was fun, for like 4 minutes.  Thursday May 28, 10:43 am, my room 	Now I know what I will do.  I will go online, type people’s names on GOOGLE, and see what comes up.  Thursday May 28, 10:50 am, my room 	Oh, my, god!  I am in utter shock!  That bitch!  How could she?  I mean, sure, I don’t like her but this is low! 	I just typed in my name in GOOGLE and my name popped up.  I clicked on the link that said “Danni Marski on the Web” and my name shows up with a ton of pictures on this website.  In addition, if that isn’t bad enough, the comments about me aren’t nice; they are low.  I scroll down to the bottom of the page to see “made by ***Tammy Hampton***” 	I have to go now and give Tammy a little call.  Friday May 29, 10:10 am, Study Hall 	Well two big things happened.  One is that the school called and said that I could come back to school seeing how they had no evidence to keep me out in the first place.  Two, I tried calling Tammy but her mom picked up and I didn’t want to go “Mrs. Hampton, your daughter has a hate website about me and I don’t like it!” 	So now, I am sitting in BORING study hall watching the ants near my desk.  The have found a Cheerio and are now huddling around it.  Luckily, Brian isn’t here today!  Friday May 29, 3:45 pm, Bus to home	  I am so bored and I don’t know what will pass the time.  Wait.  I will make a list of stuff I need to do!  English: ??????I don’t think we have any??????  Math: Page 457 #’s 1-53 odd, Page 500 #’s 2-10 all  Spanish: Tarea de Toros  Integrated Lab Sciences: Like No!  Gym: Work on touching toes for President Fitness thingy.  Creative (a class that lets you do what you want): NOPE!  Friday May 29, 9:25 pm, recalling what happened on the bus 	I am bored again and Jack is over with Trudy who is sorting our mail by what color the font is.  Natalie took Jack to Blockbuster to get a movie and he brought back the Matrix even though it is rated R.  That is so like Natalie.  So now, I am sitting on my couch watching Keanu Reeves (Neo) fight Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith).  He is so cute!  Neo, I mean, not Agent Smith.  {Only four More Days Left of School}  Few Seconds Later 	God, he stopped it because it was too scary!  Oh, well.  Now I can write about what happened today on the bus.   Oh, my god!  Tammy just stepped on the bus!  Nevertheless, what do I do?  I mean I can’t start a fight or anything because once this kid named Joe and a kid named Joey got into a fight and got kicked off the bus.  I don’t want to be kicked off the bus.  But I don’t want Tammy to think she can do this and get away with it! 	“What did Tammy do?” asks Joan who is sitting with me. 	“Ok, but promise you won’t tell anyone.” 	“Ok, I promise.” 	“She started a website that is, that is about me.” 	“Oh, my god, what did you do?” 	“Nothing yet.” 	“Why?”  Joan sounded concerned 	“I don’t know; I need to think of a plan.” 	“But, I think it’s a crime!” 	“Can’t you think of anything else besides mystery and crime!” I shouted. 	“No.” 	“I am just so confused.”  I said. “Let me help, we can get her back good.” 	“I don’t know, I mean she is friends with Natalie…” 	“God, can’t you think of yourself for once, Tammy is getting away with this and you are just going to sit there!” 	“Well what am I suppose to do?” 	“We are going to do what people who hate other people do in government…we are going to go to war.” 	And that was it.  Before I was peaceful, quiet Danni Marski and now I am a dictator in a war I don’t believe in. 	“Ok, we will need to have a plan, that is how all the successful murders happen, and we will need spies and inside-men and…” 	Right as she is about to name the army we get a little touch of what we are about to attack. 	“Danni”,  it is Tammy.  “I haven’t seen Natalie all day, where is she?” 	“Oh, um, I don’t know.” 	“I mean, I just thought you would.” 	Right after she says that she let’s down her wavy-brown-hair from the hair tie and says… 	“Hey, is it true you got knocked out during a soccer game and had to miss school because you were in the hospital?” 	“Be firm!” Joan whispers to me. 	“Tammy, I did get knocked out and did go to the hospital but that doesn’t make me a loser.” 	After I said that Joan slaps herself in the face. 	“Oh,” (Tammy giggles) “I had just wondered and all.” 	“Sure”.  I said. 	I didn’t believe one word this walking perfume said. 	“Well, talk to you later.”  She turned and sat down with another “perfume”. 	“We really need to work on your people skills.”  Mumbled Joan.   Sunday May 31, 8:30 pm, my room 	Man am I pooped!  Joan came over to discus “Operation Green”.  Personally I have no idea why she called it “green”, I liked “Operation Rat"  She planned it all on her PDA.  I want a PDA.  Brian has a PDA.   	Anyway.  She even planned the date and time of when we are going to “get revenge”.  When she showed it all to me I nearly spit all of the McDonalds McFlurry we had gotten for lunch. 	“Are you ok, you look like you just threw-up in your mouth.” 	“I’m fine, continue, what were you saying about the spiked punch?” 	Just as she left, Natalie walked in the door.  She had been playing soccer with Tammy and Trish.  When Joan bumped into her on the way out she was all “Oh, hi, you must be Danni’s friend Joan”.  She sounded all stuck up-the way Tammy sounds normally.  It was disgusting.  Joan nearly mumbled “Smelly goodbye”. 	At dinner, it was the worst.  Natalie decided to bring up birthdays and how close hers was.  Since she was born on June 2 at 11:45 pm, she has her birthday on June 2.  I was born on June 3 at 12:03 am so I have my birthday the day after.  I hate it.  Natalie has the whole day to make me jealous then on my birthday she just enjoys what she has.   	When Dad wasn’t in the Marines he would make us have it on the same day but Mom doesn’t care.  I wish the war would end.  I wish he could just come home.  I haven’t seen him in a year. 	 Few Seconds later, my room 	Oh my god!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 	I forgot that I have a big test on the English Terms tomorrow and I haven’t studied.  Aside- words spoken by an actor that the other actors are supposed not to hear.
