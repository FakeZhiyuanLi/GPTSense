       Hey everyone! As you can see from my title..YES&nbsp;I'm up to something! Not into trouble though. I just realised it this morning while listening to Avril Lavigne's "My happy ending". Umm.. I don't know, it's like all of a sudden I felt so sad. I was writing an e-mail to one of my friends&nbsp;in the Philippines.&nbsp;I realised that "why do we have to leave?". I mean,&nbsp;we were perfectly stabled and happy but for&nbsp;some&nbsp;reason someone&nbsp;has to take it away from us!&nbsp;That song('My happy ending'),&nbsp;it didn't mean&nbsp;to me as&nbsp;love song, but more of a memories song. I don't know, it's&nbsp;odd. I mean the song is meant to be&nbsp;as love song then a memories song. *sigh*, it's really weird. It's hard&nbsp;to explain. I know what I'm feeling, but to explain it to someone is hard. I'm just really homesick right now! And is school is about to start in a month(first year in hs!). ARGH! This is really annoying, I want to say it but I can't. I can't put in words. Right at this moment, I'm fucking teary eyed. Argh! Why do I have to feel this again! I thought I'm over it! I WANNA GO HOME! I DON'T BELONG IN THIS PLACE! And the sad thing about this, the only person I can talk to about this is my sister. I don't have any friends.&nbsp;Well atleast here.I can't talk to my dad either&nbsp;because he has too much things going on in his mind and I don't want him to worry. Well that's about it. Thanks for caring, and take care!

       Hello everyone! It's&nbsp;a&nbsp;Thursday(duh!)&nbsp;and it's really sunny and warm. It feels sooo good. I love the summer.&nbsp;You're out of school,you get to be lazy,it's sunny,warm, and did I mention no school?!? Hehe. Hmm.. but usually, my summers are really, really boring. I have nothing&nbsp;to do than&nbsp;to stay&nbsp;home, watch t.v., eat,and basically go online. But unless, it's my sisters day off (i have 2 elder sisters). We always go out whenever its their day-off. We go to downtown, lake, hangout with their friends, watch a movie, it's fun. Well, nothing really has happened to me yet though, it's too early. Well actually, something will happen and I'll just go write it down.... Well you see, my sister's friends are&nbsp;coming today at our house. She said that they're staying for the WHOLE day,WHOLE day! Holy shit! I have no problem with her friends,&nbsp;it's just that, I don't know, I just don't like people coming to our house. You know why? Because I always end up cleaning up the mess and cleaning before the visitors come. IT'S SOOO ANNOYING! I don't mean to be whinning, but IT IS&nbsp;REALLY ANNOYING! Oh heck, whatever. I don't know, I just feel&nbsp;that it's unfair on my side (long story).&nbsp; Well, I guess that's about it. Toodles! P.S. I just realise that I made the stupidiest post ever,lol.haha.
