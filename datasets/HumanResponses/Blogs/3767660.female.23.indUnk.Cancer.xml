       So apparently they re-enacted the wedding yesterday in Haworth. Everyone taking part on it had to wear clothes from that time. "Charlotte" and "Arthur" don't really look like their real selves, but it's not so bad. It must have been so much fun seeing it all! :D  Some pics:    That's "Charlotte" coming out of the Parsonage with "Ellen Nussey" by her side.    And this is "Charlotte". The bonnet and the dress seem to have been copied to the detail!   urlLink This is the group photograph outside the Parsonage. Everyone's looking very smart! They know they've attended a very important wedding  Btw, I can't post the picture in here since it's too big and it completely ruins my layout! :S  Oh, and the Brontë Parsonage Museum website seems to be down or something. The link's not working and neither does their home page. I wanted to take that look at the index. It's nothing but a plain list, no links, no shopping, nothing, but still seems interesting to be able to browse through all the articles they've ever published. And also I think many of the issues can be acquired one way or another. What bothers me is wanting a whole issue for the sake of just one article. A marketing idea for the Brontë Society: making all of these articles available online for a little money. You want an article, you pay a sum of money to get it. I think that would bring them very good results. They'd only have to pay for the transcription of those articles (if they don't have them on computer files already) and keep them online, while making money on it. And they could use that money to restore, or pay for another, Anne's tombstone in Scarborough, which is currently falling to pieces and will be a terrible loss if it finally disappears.  This idea is copyrighted in case someone from the Brontë Society happens to read this. Ha! :D   Now, seriously, I'm so satisfied with my idea that I think I'm going to forward it to the Brontë List :D

       During my internet break I found two interesting things:  First of all, the Brontë Society have added to their  urlLink website  an index of all the articles appeared over the years in their journal  Transactions . I think it's worth a look (later)! I've always thought it would be very useful if they did just that! :D  And secondly more news on the new Harry Potter:   I was delighted to see that a hard core of super-bright fans knew that the real title was once, in the long distant past, a possibility for 'Chamber of Secrets', and from that deduced that it was genuine. Certain crucial pieces of information in book six were originally planned for 'Chamber of Secrets', but very early on (first draft of Chamber) I realised that this information's proper home was book six. I have said before now that 'Chamber' holds some very important clues to the ultimate end of the series. Not as many as six, obviously, but there is a link.  Anyway: if you continue to exercise patience, you will find that the Do Not Disturb Door opens again… and again… giving you further hints about book six. But as a little bonus, and compensation for having been messed around by Mr. or Ms. Storgé, I shall tell you one thing without making you shift any bricks at all: the HBP is neither Harry nor Voldemort. And that's all I'm saying on THAT subject until the book's published.   Hmmmm... So the half blood prince is not the obvious character. Still room for lots of characters. Wonder who it is!!!   And the door will open again. I hope next time it will be announcing the release date!  So, back to work now...

       Finally I was able to do with my layout everything I had in mind!   I think it looks great!  Oh, and J. K. Rowling announced the title of the new Harry Potter:  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince . Will it be the obvious "half blood prince"? Hmmm... I'll add it to my Wish List in a minute!  How long will we have to wait...?

       So, I added a few things to my layout. I like the way it looks now. Wanted to add something else but it seems like my image hosting site doesn't feel like opening today. Grrrrr. I thought it was going to look great, but apparently I won't be able to try and see it today. And I don't know what's wrong with it - yesterday it was working okay. Browsing now through the forums I see I'm not the only one having that problem. And now I see Cordelia (hosted there) is not showing either :o( Let's hope it's all fixed tomorrow!  Anyway, today 150 years ago Charlotte Brontë was married to her father's curate Arthur Bell Nicholls :o) According to the villagers that saw her on the special day, Charlotte Brontë looked like a "snowdrop" :D Her wedding dress was destroyed but after that a copy as close to the original as it could be was made and it's now on display at the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth... and I'll be seeing that (and much more) in about 43 days!! :D  Also, and less memorably, today next week I will be "celebrating" my birthday. Horrible as it sounds, I'm really looking forward to getting my presents :P  And a quote from my current read:   Personajes que se me antojaron tan reales como el aire que respiraba me arrastraron en un túnel de aventura y misterio del que no quería escapar. (…). En una ocasión oí comentar a un cliente habitual en la librería de mi padre que pocas cosas marcan tanto a un lector como el primer libro que realmente se abre camino hasta su corazón. Aquellas primeras imágenes, el eco de esas palabras que creemos haber dejado atrás, nos acompañan para toda la vida y esculpen un palacio en nuestra memoria al que, tarde o temprano—no importa cuántos libros leamos, cuántos mundos descubramos, cuánto aprendamos u olvidemos—vamos a regresar.   So true!

       "Just" finished  Sylvia's Lovers  by Mrs Gaskell. The second half was considerably better than the first half. The latter I found very tedious, too many slow descriptions. In my opinion, it wouldn't have been necessary to go into so much detail. Just a brief summary of how things stood would have been more than enough to understand the rest of the novel. Also, by comparison, the ending is so hurried! A little over a year makes up the first half, and then the second half comprises quite a few years! I think it could have been more balanced. As a result, the beginning is too hard to get into, and the ending is too hard to leave.   It definitely won't be up there with my top books by Mrs Gaskell unless a reread proves otherwise, and that won't happen until at least a few years! Oh well. I did enjoy it though. And now I'm free to read  Wives and Daughters  whenever I want to. I'll wait a few weeks to start reading it since I don't like reading two books by the same author one after the other. I hope I won't be disappointed! I've been looking forward to reading it for a long time now.  So, enough on this topic. Can't have spoilers in here since  someone  :P will be reading the book in the (near? :P) future.   Such a long post... Should have been doing some research the afternoon but due to some visits I had an unexpected free afternoon. Which is no good. Let's see what my excuse will be tomorrow for not having done my bit of work... Could be doing something right now, but would be so little that it's not even worth it :o(  Back to books. Even though I still have to read the introduction to  Sylvia's Lovers , tomorrow I'm starting to read this:     A very successful, highly acclaimed book. Let's see how it turns out. It's supposedly perfect for book lovers :D Carlos Ruiz Zafón used to be one of my favourite young-adults literature writers. I have very fond memories of his books. I hope this is just as good. The worse thing is the fact that it's hardcover and huge. Not very handy for reading standing in the underground...   Enough for now! (I promised myself (and  someone  else :P)) I wouldn't be posting here too much personal stuff and look at me already :$

        urlLink Source     THE MOST UNTRANSLATABLE WORD IN THE WORLD  –       IN WORLDWIDE POLL  OF PROFESSIONAL TRANSLATORS      And the winner is ILUNGA  A Word In The Bantu Language Of Tshiluba For   A Person Ready To Forgive Any Abuse For The First Time; To Tolerate It A Second Time; But Never A Third Time    Googly, Spam And Gobbledegook   Are Most Untranslatable Words In English     ‘There Is No Such Word As Googly in Lithuanian’,  Confesses Researcher    Googly, Spam and gobbledegook have been voted among the most untranslatable words in the English language, in a worldwide poll of a thousand professional translators and interpreters.   But the most untranslatable word in any language, reckon the translators, is ilunga, a word in the Bantu language of Tshiluba for a person who is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time; to tolerate it a second time; but never a third time. And I suppose we all know that kind of person.   It narrowly outpointed shlimazl, a Yiddish word for a chronically unlucky person and radioukacz, a Polish word for a person who worked as a telegraphist for the resistance movements on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain. And both finished well ahead of klloshar, the Albanian word for loser, which, perhaps fittingly, came in last place.     The most untranslatable word in the English language was reckoned to be plenipotentiary, which even many native English-speakers may not know means a special ambassador or envoy, invested with full powers.     Whimsy, bumf and serendipity (the faculty of making happy and unexpected discoveries by accident) were other words among the top ten.   The survey was conducted by Today Translations, a London-based translation and interpreting agency, which asked a thousand of its linguists across the world to nominate the words that they found hardest to translate.     ‘My own vote would have gone to googly’, says Jurga Zilinskiene, the managing director of Today Translations, who worked as an interpreter herself before founding Today and becoming an award-winning businesswoman.  ‘People sometimes forget that an interpreter, for example, must translate not just from one language to another but from one culture to another’, says Zilinskiene, 27. ‘Sometimes, the equivalent idea just does not exist in both cultures. I am from Lithuania, for example, and we simply do not have googlies in Lithuania.’   Indeed, confesses Ms Zilinskiene, although she knew that googly was something to do with cricket she could not have told you for certain that it was, in fact, an off-breaking ball with an apparent leg-break action on the part of the bowler.   Other foreign words to make the top 10 included naa, a Japanese word used only in the Kansai area of Japan to emphasise statements or agree with someone, and pochemuchka, the Russian word for a person who asks a lot of questions.   Today Translations uses a worldwide network of over 1,500 professional linguists to provide translation and interpreting services. After asking a thousand of this network to nominate words that were problematic to translate, it then asked 50 of them to vote for just one of the top contenders.   Linguists taking part in the poll were native speakers of languages ranging from English and French to Turkish, Ukranian, Chinese, Dari, Farsi, Amharic, Pushto, Somali, Tamil and many others.   THE RESULTS IN FULL  • THE TEN FOREIGN WORDS THAT WERE VOTED HARDEST TO TRANSLATE   1 ilunga [Tshiluba word for a person who is ready to forgive any abuse for the first time; to tolerate it a second time; but never a third time. Note: Tshiluba is a Bantu language spoken in south-eastern Congo, and Zaire]   2 shlimazl [Yiddish for a chronically unlucky person]   3 radioukacz [Polish for a person who worked as a telegraphist for the resistance movements on the Soviet side of the Iron Curtain]   4 naa [Japanese word only used in the Kansai area of Japan, to emphasise statements or agree with someone]   5 altahmam  [Arabic for a kind of deep sadness]   6 gezellig [Dutch for cosy]   7 saudade [Portuguese for a certain type of longing]   8 selathirupavar  [Tamil for a certain type of truancy]   9 pochemuchka [Russian for a person who asks a lot of questions]   10 klloshar [Albanian for loser]     • THE TEN ENGLISH WORDS THAT WERE VOTED HARDEST TO TRANSLATE  1 plenipotentiary                  2 gobbledegook                   3 serendipity                                      4 poppycock                                     5 googly                                  6 Spam                                     7 whimsy                                8 bumf                                      9 chuffed   10 kitsch

       Reading:     Sylvia's Lovers By Elizabeth Gaskell. Slow beginning, but interesting story. Only 100 pages to go! (that's not my book cover, btw! :o( Couldn't find mine...)  Listening to:     (Re)Discovered Alanis a few weeks ago. Great album! :D

        Yep, that's today! Poor Harry - always spending his birthdays at the Dursleys' when they don't even care!      At any rate, I finished  Diary of an Ordinary Woman  and it's now time to get into the atmosphere for the   journey  . So may books I could choose among, but finally I've decided to take up once more Barker's bio. Not the best book (because of its size) to read in the underground but so interesting all the same. And it has to be something Brontë-related after all! So that's it. Here's the cover :P         And that's about all, really. Haven't done much more these last few days - for better or worse!

        Just back from seeing  Shrek 2 . I liked it but it lacked all the surprises the first one had. With this one you always knew what was going to happen. But it wasn't bad at all though! I enjoyed the little details: shops, characters... and some very funny lines! :D     &nbsp;   I loved it when Puss in Boots put that face... hehe! So cute...     &nbsp;   Oh, and a note for  someone  in case tomorrow I forget these two tiny details. The song from the soundtrack that appears on  Haworth Road  :P (Accidentally in Love) is exactly the one with which the film starts. And also Pinochio in the subtitles appears as Pinocho, so no apparent copyright there :o) Just thought I had to tell you :o)     &nbsp;   So that's about all, don't have much more to say. I changed some of the things in  Now!  Those two CDs I can't certainly stop listening to&nbsp;:o) Such a shame  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  is all gone now :o(     &nbsp;   Also, I can't understand why my previous post is dated on July 25 when I most certainly did it on July 24!!! :S Weird things - they want me crazy! :P     &nbsp;   So,&nbsp;I guess that's all.  Cold Case  will be starting in a while - want to&nbsp;watch it :o)

        Ooooh... a long day today!   And so hot too! I'llkeep this post very short...     &nbsp;   I got two little presents. Here's this lovely polar bear. It has magnets at the end of its claws and right now he's stuck to my bookcase :D He's so cute, but as many others, remains nameless...          What&nbsp;I can't post is the notepad I've got. There aren't any pics available. Suffice it to say that it's very cute as well, of course! :D     And one piece of news / gossip is that J.K. Rowling is expecting her third child. According to her we don't have to worry about this helping delay the isxth book. May I gather from that that we'll have this expected  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince  in about nine months? :D That would be great news!!    And I guess that's all - it's too hot to write more. Just a reminder that a week ago I'd just come home after a truly unforgettable day! :D    P.S. There's my new desktop added. 18 days to go! I'm so looking forward to being right there. As for the company I'll have throughout the journey I don't even have words to describe it. 18 days, 18 days, 18 days... :D

        I changed some things. For one thing I finished reading  Mourning Ruby  and I'm now about to start this:     &nbsp;         Should be fine. I've read  urlLink The Memory Box  by this author and absolutely loved it!    I've realised that it's ages since I read a book by a man. Weird thing. Hmmmm... Fforde is getting nearer and nearer though :D    I also added a new section on what&nbsp;I watch on TV and changed the music I'm listening too! I hadn't noticed I hadn't changed it already! Forgetful me...    Before I leave I want to post a quote from  Mourning Ruby . It belongs to its terrible ending, but what can I do. Seriously though - someone should let Helen Dunmore know how she ruined her own book with that anticlimax ending. The quote:     He's here now, within touch. He is with me. I can see him, touch him, taste him. I am printing him back onto me, dot by dot by dot. It will take me a lifetime and that's what I want.     I think it's very appropriate to mark a week has already gone by since last weekend - it conveys the feeling so well! Honestly, it seems as it all took place only yesterday and it's a week already!!    And I guess this is all. It's too  hot  to write more and yesterday I wrote a week's worth at least!

        July 1983 (no one knows the actual date) was the date John Bongiovi signed a contract with Polygram and thus became Jon Bon Jovi, the front man of rock band Bon Jovi.     &nbsp;   His success had started&nbsp;a few months before when his song Runaway won a radio contest and was included in a record. However, he'd been wanting to get into the music business for a few years already. Ever since his mum got him a guitar and he threw it down the stairs. Well, possibly a little later. It took him getting used to grabbing it in his hands!     &nbsp;   His first band was called The Rest and the songs dating back from that time are very scarce - in fact, I&nbsp;don't think I've heard any. Then he moved on to Power Station. This band's song are more widespread, even though Jon Bon Jovi is completely against them being released. However, he could do nothing against it since they were someone else's property (the people at the studio he recorded them in during the nights after cleaning, which is what he got paid for doing there, and where his cousin, the man behind this "uncomfortable" release, worked).     &nbsp;   At any rate, Runaway was an immediate success and he got signed. Through&nbsp;a number of connections and acquaintances he managed to put his band together. Members of a band who, to this date, don't have an actual contract to the record company, since Jon is the only one actually signed up! The initial members were David Rashbaum, who later changed his Jewish sounding last name to a more common Bryan, Tico Torres and Richie Sambora. The bass for their first album was played by a studio player, Hugh MacDonald. They'd later engage Alec John Such for the job.     &nbsp;   So, Bon Jovi, the album, came out with Runaway among its tracks. The second single would be She Don't Know Me. The band would later renegate of this track since it was imposed on them and they hadn't written it. Such a shame because it's a really nice track.     &nbsp;   They were touring with bigger bands after that. The members of the band have commented on how weird it was for them to be pairing off with heavy rock bands who sang things like "Kill your parents" while they were singing "Oooooh, she's a little runaway". Ahem...     &nbsp;   Almost inmediately after that came their album from hell - 7800º Farenheit. Such a gloomy, depressing album! Jon hates it with a passion (totally understandable!) and says it comes in very handy as a coaster. Only Lonely was quite well-known back then and Tokyo Road obviously became a huge, huge success in Japan. For me, these songs are in the shadow of their worst song ever - King of the Mountain. just thinking of it makes me cringe and I never ever play this album.     &nbsp;   More touring with bands they couldn't relate to but there was nothing more they coud do.     &nbsp;   It was generally agreed among the members of the band that their third album was going to decide it all, for good or bad. They got working on their biggest selling album ever. One of the biggest selling albums ever in fact! There was a time when it was selling 14 million records a week. But that was yet to come. They recorded it in Vancouver, away from their families for the first time. Up to now, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora (maybe the others too) had been living with their parents since they really couldn't afford to move out. Vancouver totally equalled debauchery for them. Clubbing, making noise, drinking, etc were their routine. Their producer, Bruce Fairbairn, even made them drink (just a little!) to get their spirits up so that they sang better. It was in one of those (strip tease) clubs that they came up with the title - Slippery When Wet. Apparently the ladies there took "showers" in front of the audience.     &nbsp;   Back in New Jersey, the record company made a terrible, terrible mistake. They encircled the picture the band had chosen for the cover with a pink band so that, according to them, it matched the woman's nails. See:     &nbsp;       The moment he saw it, Jon Bon Jovi refused to have that for his album cover! Pink?! So the record company answered back that if he wanted somethign else he'd have to get it for himself and in less that 24 hours. There he went, he tood a black plastic bag, sprinkled it with water and wrote Slippery When Wet with his finger and handed it with a historic "There you are!"&nbsp;This is what he did and what we can see today:     &nbsp;       However, copies were already flying to Japan and nobody could stop them. Nowaday, one of these original vynil covers is basically worth a small fortune. Oh well.     Slippery was a huge, instant success for the band. They became huge and started touring by themselves. Suddenly they were rock stars and able to move out of their childhood homes... Such a shame they didn't have the time for anything but touring, promoting, etc.     Only three singles of Slippery were released. By the time the third came ou the band was exhausted and now they could say NO whenever they wanted they used their right. Now the band usually comment on how many good songs - songs that would have been high on the hit lists - were left aside because of that exhaustion.    Then, after a few months' rest, started the recording sessions for their next album - New Jersey. This would be the perfect follow up for Slippery. Such a hit as well. The band, once more, got down to touring here and there and everywhere on the planet. Their longest, most intense tour ever. By the end of the tour things were looking quite so right as their album sales though. For the last shows, Jon was having to get steroids shot straight to his neck so that he could sing without causing irreparable damage to his vocal cords and without feeling a terrible pain every time he sang a note. But that was not all. his relationship with Richie Sambora was cooling down by the day. They could hardly bear to look at each other! During the final concert of that tour in Mexico Jon announced that the band was not likely to go on. It was 1989.    Jon was about to start his "grey summer" as he likes to call it. He went to his house in Malibu (ugh), which he had bought for himself and his now wife Dorothea as a wedding present. He says he spent whole days sitting on the beach, looking at the horizon, with a bottle of anything alcoholic in his hand. He even says that once, when travelling in the back of a car he considered just opening the door and jumping and ending with it. According to him, he then looked at Dorothea, sitting beside him, and knew he couldn't do that - and he didn't, of course!    With perfect timing, he was then offered writing the score for Young Guns II. He said yes. This is when he realised how cool it must be to be an actor and started taking acting lessons in private. The score was a much bigger success than the film. But what's more, it helped him realise just how large Bon Jovi had been. It took some time for him to fully realise this, though. Meanwhile Richie was working in a solo project as well, though he had found it harder to get a record deal. He'd soon release Stranger in this Town, with a collaboration of Eric Clapton himself.    1991. Bon Jovi get together and start working in what would become their fifth album - Keep The Faith. Appropriate title or what? Jon and Richie had decided that it was too stupid fighting to be in the spotlight. Not without reason, one of the causes of their near split up was Richie complaining that Jon got much more attention than he did. Obviously, part of it all came from the fact that Jon was the only one with an actual contract. Things were looking good and bright again!    Keep The Faith is released and it has some trouble finding its way back to the hit lists. the emptiness Bon jovi had left had been replaced by boybands as New Kids On The Block and grunge bands. Their type of music was no longer in demand. Plus, Keep The Faith had absolutely nothing to do with their previous albums. In the end, things didn't turn out so badly though - at least not as far as sales were concerned. Once more Bon Jovi were out on the road. But things were not going well on that department. Alec John Such kept doing silly things on stage. Well, he'd always have, only it was getting worse. Carrying a gun on stage, playing while he was completely drunk, acting silly. And what was worse, he kept on making mistakes that the rest kept having to cover up for him. Jon, as the leader and sort of boss, decided to put an end to it and... fired him! Needless to say, Alec got mad and made his round of interviews telling tales about the band, Jon and everything he thought could bring him back to grace. Jon had none of it and never ever spoke of the matter, never bothered to clarify the real reasons why Alec had been fired. In fact, any journalist could consider the interview as well as over if the topic was brought up. Through the years, though, both have seen each other and Alec even has performed from time to time with the band. But that's it.    The&nbsp;"new" bassist was Hugh MacDonald who, in fact, had been always there, always the bassist for the albums (except for Keep The Faith,&nbsp;I think). however, he'd have a different status. He'd just be the bassist, never an offcioal member - that is, he'd not take part in interviews, photo sessions, etc. Which is pretty good in my eyes since he gets to do only the music thing.    Then in 1995 came their best (for me!!) album. Lyrically speaking is just pure magic. Bon Jovi at their most mature, at their deepest, at their most complex. The album has layers and layers of sound. The production is absolutely FABULOUS. If heaven could be in an album that would These Days for me. Maybe I cherish it so much because it brought the badn to my attention. Their first single This Ain't A Love Song became one of my favourite songs ever instantly and became the tune of a whole summer. It was definitely love at first sight - and it was! the first time I heard the song was on a TV programme and I turned to look at it and, ahem, thought the band's singer was looking so great! Ahem, that has nothing to do with the band...    My aunt gave me a tape of These Days and I played it all the time. It is, to this date, the album I've played the most. My friend lent me a tape of Keep The Faith - it wasn't bad but all&nbsp;I craved was for These Days again and again.    New tour! And they were coming to Madrid! Oh, but i had no one to come with me so I didn't go. however,&nbsp;I did manage to persuade my father to go outsie the stadium to hear it all. By the time we got there, the show was over (too soon!) adn we were in a&nbsp; terrible traffic jam that put my father in a terrible mood. He'll always remember that when I talk about Bon Jovi. Funny man... Back on topic, then&nbsp;I found out Jon had had an attack of hay fever and had been forced to leave earlier after a, well, not a great show.    Oh,&nbsp;I forgot, These Days didn't do well in the charts. Except for in Europe. In fact the band call it the "European album". Okay, let's admit that it's not the usual Bon Jovi - it's Bon Jovi at their best! At any rate, the band do say the lrics are quite sad and they don't know where all that came from since they were all going through quite happy phases in the personal lives.    Cross Road, their greatest hits album, came out with two new songs. Two great songs! They left lots of their hits out, I still don't know why.     Another break for the band after that. Apparently no hard feelings for this one. Just a little time for themselves. By now some had children, some were getting married, some were getting into acting, some were devoting time to painting. Jon released Destination Anywhere. Ugh. Richie released Undiscovered Soul - much better.    Back together in 2000 they came back to the music scene with It's My Life, from their album Crush. They visited Spain on a promo tour and signed my copies of Crush and These Days (which I had in CD by now since the tape was a little worn out). YAY!!    Crush would bring about the end of the old era. Lots of fans deserted the band, saying they'd become poppy and commercial (ahem, as if they'd never been!). On the other hand, legions of new fans joined the ranks and supported the band with renewed strength.     Release of One Wild Night. A compilation of their best well known songs live. Ha! Such a mess. Such a terrible production. Ugh. Bon Jovi, reputed for their good shows, releasing that was certainly not a good idea. It must have put so many people off!    Then Bounce came and it was more of the same. Looking back though, I spent a long time avoiding Crush. When Bounce was released I quite liked it even if I do agree that it's not the usual Bon Jovi at all (and not in a These Days sort of way! Far from it). Then I gave Crush a secind chance and realised it's not so bad. In fact it's so much better than Bounce actually. Bounce has a few good songs but its bad songs make it so terrible. Crush does have Say It Isn't So with, along with King of the Mountain, is my most hated Bon Jovi song. Fifty Fifty.    But Bounce Tour brought the guys over here. This time I'd make sure I went. Even if I had to queue four hours under the pouring rain, skipping classes (hehe, that was a highlight!) and being cold and paying double since I bought my friend into coming along together with her ticket. And it was so much worth it! The show was awesome! It left me reaching out for more.&nbsp;I know it won't be the last show I go to. At least that's what&nbsp;I like to think.    And from there to their little experiment This Left Feels Right. Their greatest hits with a twist. This album divided the fans. Some thought it was great, some thought it was definitely the end of it all. Jon saying that it marked the end of the first chapther of their book didn't help much to be honest. People are scared now! In my opinion, they should have done this live, as they did in the DVD. Then you can really feel the changes in a better way. Jon is so well in there!! I was a bit reluctant towards the album at first. Now I think it's original. And I can see it isn't their intention following that line. In fact, they didn't even promote it. And, really, it sold pretty well after all!    And here we are. The band are once more going their own separate ways for a while. More children, more solo projects, more acting, more collaborations... And also putting together what will become their (ahem 20, a bit late!) anniversary boxset with lots of previously unreleased material that apparently not even the die hard fans can know. Let's see. It's supposed to be released by the end of the year.     So that's it. I'd wanted to keep it shorter but got so carried away...

        (Now I can choose I'm using a "better" font!)     &nbsp;   So this is my brand new Bon Jovi CD:&nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       &nbsp;         &nbsp;   I've enjoyed discovering David and Tico's voices :D Tico's especially :P     &nbsp;   So, that's all for now / today (who knows?). I'm off to look for some pics of Roy Lichtenstein's work, which&nbsp;I do like now :D Such a shame there doesn't seem to be many wallpapers related to his work. The few there are I don't like...      EDIT:  So funny that the new&nbsp;Blogger dashboa  rd makes you edit the HTML everytime you want to post a picture since it understands that you're posting a link, not a picture.

       So I finished  The Photograph  I think it was an amazing book, very originally written. The plot was quite predictable, but the language was so beautiful that it was the reason you read on. Plus, there were some parts where you wanted to know what was going to happen next. In the event it all turned out as you imagined it would though.  The characters are completely different from each other. All of them very three-dimensional. Except for one who I didn't understand. I mean, it was an extremely real character but I just didn't like him.   What I never found were the humourous bits commented in the reviews :S  So, my new read is this:      A very nice cover! Let's see how the contents stand up to it! I'll be starting it tomorrow not today though.  And in a while I'll go to press the rec button so that I can later watch the  Gilmore Girls .  And I guess that's all. I have to phone my cousin to thank her for the DVD which I completely forgot to do yesterday :$ I've been trying to reach her for a while but the line is engaged...  So, this is my post for today. Nothing more, nothing less... :D

       Got the DVD so I removed it from my Wish List (obviously). A few pics to celebrate it!             Where they said:    Bob:  I was feeling tight in the shoulders and neck, so I called down and had a Shiatsu massage in my room...   Charlotte:  Mmh, that's nice!   Bob:   And the tightness has completely disappeared and been replaced by unbelievable pain.  [Charlotte laughs]     Bob:  I don't want to leave.   Charlotte:  So don't. Stay here with me. We'll start a jazz band.     Charlotte:  I tried taking pictures, but they were so mediocre. I guess every girl goes through a photography phase. You know, horses... taking pictures of your feet.   So I guess that's all for today. Wonder when I'll have the time to actually watch it!

       ... I'm going to post today! :D It's just a couple of pictures of my notepad and my new backpack. I think they're very cute...    My backpack. It's got something in front of it which didn't come with it :P     My notepad :D I started it on April 18!! So it's obviously older than the backpack.  And that's all. Tomorrow it's the release date of  Lost In Translation  and I'm really looking forward to buying it! I don't know if I'll have the time to watch it though.   So that's that for today! :o)

       100 years ago, a day like today, Pablo Neruda was born in Parral, Chile. He's one of the few Spanish-speaking poets to whose poetry I can relate. Maybe not the whole of it, but some poems by him I do like very much. I'm posting a couple of his poems as a tiny tribute to his memory. The first one I didn't remember reading, but I must have since we read them all in COU. Anyway, I've read it now, looking for the second one, and thought it was very nice as well. The second one brought tears to my eyes when we were reading it in class, which is not the place where many things actually bring tears to your eyes now, is it? Such a beautiful, beautiful poem.   POEMA 3    Ah vastedad de pinos, rumor de olas quebrándose, lento juego de luces, campana solitaria, crepúsculo cayendo en tus ojos, muñeca, caracola terrestre, en ti la tierra canta!  En ti los ríos cantan y mi alma en ellos huye como tú lo desees y hacia donde tú quieras. Márcame mi camino en tu arco de esperanza y soltaré en delirio mi bandada de flechas.  En torno a mí estoy viendo tu cintura de niebla y tu silencio acosa mis horas perseguidas, y eres tú con tus brazos de piedra transparente donde mis besos anclan y mi húmeda ansia anida.  Ah tu voz misteriosa que el amor tiñe y dobla en el atardecer resonante y muriendo! Así en horas profundas sobre los campos he visto doblarse las espigas en la boca del viento.     POEMA 14    Juegas todos los días con la luz del universo. Sutil visitadora, llegas en la flor y en el agua. Eres más que esta blanca cabecita que aprieto como un racimo entre mis manos cada día.  A nadie te pareces desde que yo te amo. Déjame tenderte entre guirnaldas amarillas. Quién escribe tu nombre con letras de humo entre las estrellas del sur? Ah déjame recordarte como eras entonces, cuando aún no existías.  De pronto el viento aúlla y golpea mi ventana cerrada. El cielo es una red cuajada de peces sombríos. Aquí vienen a dar todos los vientos, todos. Se desviste la lluvia.  Pasan huyendo los pájaros. El viento. El viento. Yo solo puedo luchar contra la fuerza de los hombres. El temporal arremolina hojas oscuras y suelta todas las barcas que anoche amarraron al cielo.  Tú estás aquí. Ah tú no huyes. Tú me responderás hasta el último grito. Ovíllate a mi lado como si tuvieras miedo. Sin embargo alguna vez corrió una sombra extraña por tus ojos.  Ahora, ahora también, pequeña, me traes madreselvas, y tienes hasta los senos perfumados. Mientras el viento triste galopa matando mariposas yo te amo, y mi alegría muerde tu boca de ciruela.  Cuánto te habrá dolido acostumbrarte a mí, a mi alma sola y salvaje, a mi nombre que todos ahuyentan. Hemos visto arder tantas veces el lucero besándonos los ojos y sobre nuestras cabezas destorcerse los crepúsculos en abanicos girantes.  Mis palabras llovieron sobre ti acariciándote. Amé desde hace tiempo tu cuerpo de nácar soleado. Hasta te creo dueña del universo. Te traeré de las montañas flores alegres, copihues, avellanas oscuras, y cestas silvestres de besos.  Quiero hacer contigo lo que la primavera hace con los cerezos.    Awwwwww...  I wanted to post a couple of pictures as well of the small backpack I bought on Friday and the matching notebook but the photo site is acting silly again, so maybe tomorrow...

       New desktop indeed! Seeing as I like to keep it updated with what's going on in my life I felt I should use one that reminded me of what was coming next weekend (as if I needed to!) so what's better than a wallpaper made by the one that's causing all the excitement? :D I don't know if it can be seen in here but on the actual computer it looks really, really nice. It produces good vibrations :D  So, since I have the picture website open, I'm going to post some of those pics I took a few days ago. Still haven't had time to take pics of my new stuffed friends. Will do... some day :P In fact there are only two pictures left from the other day. Both belong to the bookcase that stands by my bed. They're looking old now, since with the Amazon books I had to restructure it all. Oh, but finally nobody was forced to go into exile. They all made room for one another :D    This is the original Brontë place. All of these books are Brontë-related!    And this is the top part of the bookcase. This is shared by Mrs Gaskell and Mrs Woolf :D   Ahem... I now realise that I forgot to take a pic of the Brontë "annexe". Oh well, I'll do when I do the stuffed friends :D  So that's all for today :D

       And I've been defeated! Word is an evil programme and with a life of its own. It doesn't care what you tell it to do, it'll just do whatever it wants.  My old CD burner had a programme for creating your own CD covers, etc, but the new one doesn't, so I've had to make one by myself. Apparently, centimetres in word are smaller than in real life, so the CD cover I've been making for the last couple of hours is smaller than it should and won't fit into the cover. Plus, I wanted to do something else that it just refused to do as well. Grrrrrrr.  So now what could have been a very cute CD cover is just something that looks like I've made in 3 minutes or something :o(  Evil computers!

       I just found out that...   On this day in 1848   Charlotte and Anne Bronte visited London to meet their publisher and revealed their true identity. The Bronte sisters had been using the pseudonyms Acton Currer and Bell.   How interesting. The bit where Charlotte shows George Smith a letter to "Currer Bell" from himself and he asks, puzzled, "where did you get this" and she replies something like "on the mail, sir" always makes me smile :D Oh, those are not the actual words of any of them though :o( I wish I could look them up right now, but I'm afraid I can't :o( I'll check them later!!     EDIT:  (22:15) Just checked the actual quotes. George Smith asked, "Where did you get this from?" and Charlotte replied, "From the post-office" :D  I just found out (thanks to  someone ) that the  Gilmore Girls  are back today. Such a shame  Cuéntame  is still on and my parents are watching that. Oh well, I have to tape GG and watch it some other day. These days I've got plenty of time to catch up on things at night, while I have my dinner... I'm going back to my old (it now seems ages!) timetables, having late showers, having dinner quite late, watching some TV while having it... Going back to what's supposed to be normal and I'm now finding quite dull. Anyway, there are worse things than that, so I can't really complain. And I don't even have reasons to complain - it's just a different schedule. I'm still extremely happy about how things stand and all that :D  News! at last got my books from Amazon - they're so huge and look so great! Haven't had time to put them away yet, will probably do so tomorrow. Now it's time to have a shower, have dinner, watch some TV, go to bed, sleep, dream...

       So, here it is, my first post with 23 years *sigh* It's okay though, not such a bad age. I don't feel any difference really. Well, if anything I'm even more forgetful :$ I didn't think it could get any worse. Now I see it could and has!  So, my birthday was yesterday. Had a longish day, but was worth every minute of it (well maybe I could have spared the children bringing chaos to my room). I started getting presents at 12am and it never stopped. And I got lots and lots of things. Got a couple more today :D And I'll be getting some spare ones in the next few days as well. I got lots of mates for my "stuffed friends" :D There are two sheep, who still don't have names (poor creatures! Suggestions accepted, btw)and a tiny tiger with "magnetic" paws who has just found its way to my library and it has got stuck there in a very cute position, so it's staying put :D It doesn't have a name yet either (again, suggestions are very welcome!). I got a very funny, extremely special Power Point presentation made by  someone  which I must have seen like a thousand times already, every time with an ear-to-ear smile on my face :D Also a hair dryer, which I have partially used for the first time, and will continue to do so in a while. Books (still only in spirit, at least some of them), DVDs, a very nice penchant, pens and all... Presents are very nice, they do help you get through the trauma of becoming older ( Not old... just older! , says Jon Bon Jovi :P).  And today was back to normal, only I was still a bit "high" from all the excitement yesterday, but I'm okay now. Back to my usual self by now, I think.  I'm missing  someone's  conversations on MSN but it's okay. He's having a real break which is just what he needed, so deep down I'm really happy about it. And it's not like we're  incommunicado  from each other. We have our mails and our sms. We still speak lots more than most people... but then again, we're very special people, aren't we?  So that's about all. I updated "Now!" since I'm reading a new book. Ooh, I like its cover, so let me post it in here:     And also added a new section so that I can post both the films I go and see at the cinema and the films I watch at home. I added  The Party  which was a (wanted) birthday present that I couldn't help watching yesterday! I think I'll be watching  Shrek  I (which I got today off a friend) and the two Harry Potters (which I got yesterday... though no  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  DVD as of yet! :P) in the near future.   I might be posting some pics of my new stuffed friends in here in the near future as well. I don't dare to say when since 23 seem to be very busy already, but I will when I have a spare while, I promise :o)  So, time to go and (newly) dry my hair and have dinner and watch TV like normal people apparently do when they don't have the most interesting, funny, sweet conversations on MSN :P

       I just found a website where maps are fun to play with :D   There's a button where you can see the aerial picture of the area, but as you scroll over the image, the names of the streets will appear on top of the actual photo. I like it!  I found two very interesting ones for this summer :D   urlLink Haworth    urlLink Scarborough   Okay, so I manage to find my way in Haworth, but I'm completely lost in Scarborough. I can't even find the famous castle. In fact I can't find anything at all for that matter. Goodness, I'm bad at reading maps! But it's nice to scroll over it anyway :P  I didn't know some Haworth streets were named after Brontë characters such as Shirley Street or Heathcliff Street - can't imagine what Heathcliff Street may look like!  Also, you can play with the maps, zoom in and zoom out. I like them very much. I think it's a very useful and original idea, isn't it?  Just been talking to my Aunt on the phone. She wants to know what to buy me for my birthday. And I just don't know :S I can't think of any book she can get in her area, can't think of anything at all. And she says she's not coming tomorrow if she doesn't have a present for me. What a stressing situation! :D What do I want? I've been going through my books wish list, but all the books I want can't be found in here, so I'm at a loss! Got to think of something I want!!! Think, think, think...

       ...Hehe, it's fun commenting on  someone's  comments :P  So yesterday was the first day I didn't write in here... Surprisingly, I didn't have withdrawal symptoms or anything. It was a busy day, after all. But don't have much to post right now :S  A short review on La Sombra del Viento without spoilers? I'll try :D I finished the book yesterday, and it has to be one of the most addictive books ever! I found the storyline incredibly original, as well as the characters. I like the parallels too. And the style, which is very original as well as very visual. It's easy to picture all of the scenes with very short (but very concise too) descriptions. It all reminded me of the books by Carlos Ruiz Zafón I used to read. The man has a thing with this type of atmospheres, I guess.   I liked the ending, can't say really why without a lot of spoilers, so I'd better shut up :D   I do wonder if Carlos RZ will be writing more books in the near future. so far, I've never been disappointed by a book by him, so I'd be more than willing to give it a try!  In the meantime I wonder what I'm going to read now. I have three books I feel like reading right now, but I can't make up my mind. At any rate, whatever it is, I won't be starting it until the day after my birthday (unless another new one gets in the way). It should be a great one it being the first I'll be reading with 23 years... Oh, we'll see. I'll be reading mags and Brontë Studies in the meantime too.   So I guess this is all for the moment. A post on my last Sunday with 22...

       So, the batteries of our digital camera were about to run out so in order to get rid of them, I've been taking pictures of many things for a while. Here are some of the results. These are  just  a few of my lovely stuffed friends :D    This is Cordelia, given to my by a friend on my last birthday. She's a professional model as you can see! :P    This is Tatty Teddy (his face more like). Such a cutie. It's a native of York, England.    This is Keeper, named after Emily Brontë's dog. Keeper is also a native of York and it captured me right from day one. I used to visit it in the shop like once every two days (sometimes even more often) until I gave in to temptation and bought it in my last week in York. Its touch is superb and (this is not favouritism) it has to be one of the cutest stuffed dogs ever!    Okay, this one is obviously not stuffed, but still so cute. Its name is Mark and I've had it for many years now.  Anyway, I took many more pics, but I'd better keep some of the others for some other day :o)  Now some tidbits. I've got an e-mail from Amazon saying they've sent my books today. I'm happy about it, but a little disappointed that they won't be here for my birthday. Oh well.  I'm completely mesmerised by La Sombra del Viento. I've been reading it for three straight hours without even realising it! And now I'm going back to reading. I'll sit on the balcony until there isn't enough light to read. I'll take a glass of the ice-cold lemon juice I made (!!!) before lunch to accompany my read.  Grrrr, I'm pretty sure I wanted to write something else but I can't remember so I guess that's it!

       I bought a new CD today! :D This one:     Definitely not my favourite album by Alanis, but I guess it's very original. It's not bad, just hard to get into. Maybe it'll take more than just one listen. But it includes  Thank U  which is certainly an amazing song. The rest of the songs are, as most people say, written in "stream-of-consciousness" style. I guess they're right.   Anyway, it was a good offer in the shop and I couldn't let it pass!  But right now  UR  is playing and it's great (I hadn't listened to the second half of the album before, so it's all new now).  So, I guess that's all I have to say.  Oh, and tomorrow's Friday at last and  someone  is starting his holidays. I heartily hope you have a great summer and have all the time to rest and spend time doing just what you want as you rightly deserve! :o)  Me, I'll be just starting my last weekend with 22 years *sigh* Time flies, huh?

       Too bad that I got to know it through a (beer) add, but better to have known it this way than to have never known it at all :D   CANCIONCILLA DEL PRIMER BESO   En la mañana verde, quería ser corazón. Corazón.  Y en la tarde madura quería ser ruiseñor. Ruiseñor.  Alma, ponte color de naranja. Alma, ponte color de amor.  En la mañana viva, yo quería ser yo. Corazón.  Y en la tarde caída quería ser mi voz. Ruiseñor.   Alma, ponte color naranja! Alma, ponte color de amor!             Federico García Lorca   Hehe, that was my first July post! :D

        So we're back...       Hmmm... I don't want (or need to) write everything we did in here, but I wish there was some way I could put into words the magic of it all. I guess part of the magic comes from the fact that it's all completely undefinable and can't be written down. Anyway, we both know what it is and there's really no need to do it. But still I wish I could find some words - in any language - that described that feeling that lasted all throughout the journey. It still lasts, but in a different way.  It's when we're together when it reaches its highest point.       Just wanted to say that these days have been the best (and shortest!) days of my life - I'd never had such a great time. "Great" not meaning only fun, but that magic feeling I was talking about before.      I'll cherish the memories of the whole journey forever but I guess we shouldn't get stuck in here, looking only to a wonderful (already) past experience. We should be looking in both directions - backwards and forwards. And be so happy.      That's all I can really say. I have many things inside my chest but in a way I can't really get them out - not in a  bad way. I just like them in there.       So,  thank you, thank you, thank you  for making these days  completely  unforgettable.       PS. Have you seen my new desktop? :D

             Henri Cartier Bresson died today at 95 :o( I wouldn't define myself as a fan of his work - if only because I know very little about it. But I love some of his pictures and think he was a brilliant photographer who, as is expected of a photographer, could capture the moment perfectly and convey lots of messages through a single image. Here are some of my favourite photographs by him. The first two especially I've always loved:                                     So that's it. A comforting thought - this time next week I'll be in Haworth next to  someone . Really, I'm so, so excited about all this :D

        At last! Kate Atkinson's new book synopsis can finally be read! Sounds a lot different to her usual stuff, but not bad. Shame it will not be released until September 1st - and then it will only get released in hardcover. Better that than nothing at all, I guess.     Here's the synopsis:      Case Histories  by  Kate Atkinson .   The scene is set in Cambridge, with three case histories from the past: A young child who mysteriously disappeared from a tent in her back garden; An unidentified man in a yellow jumper who marched into an office and slashed a young girl through the throat; and a young woman found by the police sitting in her kitchen next to the body of her husband, an axe buried in his head. Jackson Brodie, a private investigator and former police detective, is quietly contemplating life as a divorced father when he is flung into the midst of these resurrected old crimes. Julia and Amelia Land, long having given up hope of uncovering the truth of what happened to their baby sister, Olivia, suddenly discover her lost toy mouse in the study of their recently-deceased father. Enlisting Jackson's help they embroil him in the complexities of their own jealousies, obsessions and lust. A woman named Shirley needs Jackson to help find her lost niece. Amidst the incessant demands of the Land sisters, Jackson meets solicitor Theo Wyre whose daughter, Laura, was murdered in his office and, now that the police case has been closed, is desperate for Jackson to help him lay Laura's ghost to rest.   And the cover, which is alse completely different to all her previous ones!     I'm really looking forward to it being released, even though I still have to read her novel  Emotionally Weird . Hmmm... that should be before this one. I'll manage! :D  So, so happy too - only   8 days   left until the   journey  !!!!! And I still have quite a few things to buy, get ready. Hmmm... I hope I'll have time for everything Monday &amp; Tuesday next week :D But I'll get my pounds ready this week though! That'll be great, a reminder that the   journey   is getting ever so close! Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!!       EDIT:  Ooooh!!! Just found the best site ever for HTML. Well, I didn't really *find* it since there's been a link to it on blogger for ages now, but today was the first day I actually went there. And my! They had everything I needed (and more!) I've been able to do all sorts of things now - from arranging links to open in new windows to use pictures as links to centering the image of my desktop which was getting on my nerves because it wasn't right in the centre of the column! Lots and lots of things! And many more I don't need right now but which I'll certainly bear in mind in the future. Definitely a site worth a visit or two... or a thousand!
