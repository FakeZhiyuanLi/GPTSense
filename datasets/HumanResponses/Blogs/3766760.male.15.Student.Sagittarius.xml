      Suicide... Floats in my mind. One wrong turn, Decides my fate.  Suicide... Bottles up inside. I can't hold it much longer, The stress is too great.  Suicide... Stress takes it's toll. It messes with my life, And eventually it ruins me.  Suicide... It's on a roll. To defeat my purposes, It wants me not to be.   Josh Maloney 6/9/04

      I see your wrists. I know your pain. Lets sompare scars. See who's the bigger man.  What are yours about? Mine are about love. It was about control. So I lost my love.  So you lost your love too. I know how it feels. How long were you with yours? I was with mine for years!  So you made it close. You got as far as black. I got to as good as dead. I went there and back.   Josh Maloney 6/9/04

      The day is dying, i'm completely stressed out. Concentrating on suicide, nobody there to help.  Worse day in my life, and the clock just struck ten. I lay the blade against my wrist, this is the end.  I sit empty, of love, honesty, trust. But only concentrating of one thing, once I die, my body becomes of dust.

      I feel so lonely,  as if I didn't exist. It's harsh pain,  the blister exists.  My love was stolen, from a very hated person. He's tried so much, to change her into another person.  He has stolen my love, the only thing I have left. It hit me like a bullet, the blister exists.   Josh Maloney 6/9/04

      sitting here at 1:30 a.m. with eric king. he's staying over my house tonight, and he's playing wwe raw 2 on my x-box while i sit here, at the computer, typing this out and trying to get my friend jay to buy me a hatchetman off of e-bay, cuz my account doesn't work. and that really fuckin sucks. me, courtney and eric just got done watching a neo nazi movie known as "American History X". awesome fucking movie with Edward Norton, that kid from the Terminator, and that really really fat kid from "The Butterfly Effect" and "Remember The Titans". it's an awesome movie, and i suggest whether you're a nazi, a kkk member, a jewish person, a priest, catholic, christian, prodistinian, satanic, italian, irish, portuguese, black, white, purple, what the fuck ever, go take you fat ass down to blockbuster, or knapp video, or wherever the hell you go to rent a fucking movie, and rent it, it's awesome, and it's not just about neo-nazi civiliazation either. it's about a person who is nazi, he kills blacks, he goes to prison to do his time, and his younger brother follows his footsteps, and in prison, he starts to change his visions on the black community, and isn't nazi anymore. and now he has to change his brother's acts, but he's too late. it's awesome, and your ass needs to see it.  anyways, me, court and eric king went to kiddies day today, and we watched the fireworks, and watched the 100 + wiggas and niggas (You kno who you are!) run their rap-lovin asses from the pigs. Y'ALL ARE PUSSIES WHOEVER WAS RUNNIN!!!  Ozzfest is coming up people, and guess what, if you take your purple asses down to the tweeter center, lawn seats are still availible FOR TEN BUCKS A POP!!! you're pretty fuckin stupid like me if you don't go down there and get yourself a ticket!   but yea, my relationship with courtney is starting to slip, atleast i'm starting to feel that way... and i don't want to. We haven't been talking much, and I really want her to talk to me about things but she won't. and she says nothings wrong. and then sometimes i feel like shes lying to me, but i don't know what, especially shit with jeremy. i've basically given up this cheap shit w/ him... for her, and if she doesn't start doing shit for this relationship, i'm out of it, cuz i can not stand it. and i think she knows that by now. i love her, shes my fiance, but idk, sometimes i gotta do wrong, in order to find the right. shes seems like everything to me, but its shit in our relationship that she keeps from me. I KNOW for a fact theres shit that she won't tell me or she'll tell other people, but not me, and i fuckin hate it, and i'm not gonna deal with it much longer. and some shit she misses like fuckin flirting and all that shit, she could have back, if i break up with her, and she won' have to worry about me being up her ass about jeremy or anybody or anything. and this relationship i want to keep, but its hard to keep it when theres nothing in it for me. and i really want her to start talking to me a lot more, and doing shit with me a lot more, and doing shit for me a lot more. and if you're one of my friends in taunton, then you'll know how much i love courtney, and how much hit i do for her, yet i sit here and discuss my problems. i can't do this with her, cuz then we'll fight, or she'll act a certain way that i don't like, or she'll start doing shit, just because someone else wants her to, and she never understands where i come from. and if you know her, please talk to her a little bit. i love her a lot, but idk at this point. i love you so much courtney and i don't want to loose you.   caitlyn & eric: to of the best friends i have and thank you for being there when i've needed you the most. and i really enjoy helping the both of you out too. you guys are awesome!!!  alyse leonard: you're awesome! a really kool friend to me and i have fun when we hang out. we should hang out more often. and don't worry about bobby, i'll take care of him for you. no problem. *have fun at camp*  john lopes: dude!!! you're a really good fuckin friend and you're ALWAYS there when i need you, especially dealing with courtney's pms bullshit. and especially that night when we both died, and it was a tragic night.  roman fillion: CASHEW!! you're ass better get back from florida and get to the galleria mall, or i'm gonna go psycho, and when you're at fuckin floida... it isn't as boring as massachusetts. theres beaches with REALLY NICE CHICKS!!! or go to fuckin disney world, or a fuckin baseball game, or sea world, or cape canavral, or something, but it's a lot better than massachusetts!!!  courtney demoranville: my baby! i love you so much and i love it when you're there for me, and i'd be dead right now if it wasn't for you, cuz i'd have to go to either a foster home, a group home, or jail, and i'll die if i go back to any of those places. and you kept me from there and you've helped me out and supported my ass with the bullshit with my mom. i love you cupcake! XoxO  ashley jenkins: ashley, i can't even begin to say anything. thank you for believing in me and making me stop drinking, i don't know where i would be if i continued. and i did it all for you. you and your damn emo mucis shit, you've got me listening to it constantly now and sometimes i fuckin hate it. but then again... i love it. ~AND YOU'RE STILL A REDNECK!  brooke leonard: you're an awesome friend to have around and you're a person i can talk to sometimes, and i really enjoy that. you better kick ass in softball!!!  um... it's 2:22 a.m. right now, so if i forgot you, well, it's 2:22 in the fucking morning, so don' pull a hernia on me ok!! kool beans! i'll talk to you all later!!

      This is the year where hope fails you The test subjects run the experiments And the bastards you know, is the hero you hate But cohesing is posssible if we strive Theres no reason, theres no lesson No time like the present, telling you right now What have you got to lose, what have you got to lose Except your soul...just listen  I fight for the unconventional My right, and its unconditional I can only, be as real as i can The disadvantage is I never knew the plan This isnt the way just to be a martyr I cant, walk alone any longer I fight, for the ones that cant fight And if I lose, at least I tried  We, we are the new diablic We, we are the bitter bucolic If I have to give my life you can have it We, we are the pulse of the maggots  I won't, be the inconsequential I won't, be the wasted potential I can make it, as severe as I can Until you realize You'll never take a chance It isn't, just a one-side aversion We've dealt, with a manic diversion And I won't, let the truth be perverted And I won't leave another victim deserted  We, we are the new diablic We, we are the bitter bucolic If I have to give my life you can have it We, we are the pulse of the maggots  Do you understand? (yes) Do you understand? (yes) Do you understand? (yes) Do you understand? (yes)  Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die)  We fight til no one can fight us We live, and no one can stop us We pull when we're pushed too far And the advantages is The bottom line is We never, had to fight in the first place We only, had to spit back at their face We won't, walk alone any longer What doesnt kill us, only makes us stronger  We, we are the new diablic We, we are the bitter bucolic If I have to give my life you can have it We, we are the pulse of the maggots  Do you understand (yes) Do you understand (yes) Do you understand (yes) Do you understand (yes)  Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die) Say it again say it again (we won't die)

      Me and Court just got back from KFC and Dunkin Donuts on 44, we just walked there and back. And now here I am sitting here bored, with Courtney sitting behind me playing with sewing needles, I guess thats the fun thing to do now. Nobody's around. Caitlyn is working until 5, Eric is in Vermont, Alyse is at summer camp, she won't be back until Friday, and then she goes back on Monday, Roman is in Florida, CJ... well id on't know what he's doing, probably sitting at home whacking off, and i haven't really seen Jay around. He was being mean to me yesterday. He wouldn't get me a hatchetman off of Ebay again, cuz he lost the last bid. Lizzie's probably too busy being up Jay's ass, or having crazy, wild sex with him. hmmm... beats me! Oh well!!! i'm bored people, come and get me and do something fun with me, before I waste my life presentng my mallrat life at the Silver City Galleria Mall. Ya' know, sometimes I wish we still had school, friends, fights, teachers to bitch at, school lessons sometimes gives you random ideas to write a story about or draw about, it's funny, but I won't see those days until August 31 when I have to go back to the hell-hole of Taunton High School!!! later Maggots!!!

      Yesterday, Courtney and I went with her parents, and her parents friends to Onset Beach to watch the July 4th fireworks. They were awesome, with the exception that the tide was coming in. We got to Onset around 6-6:30 and sat on the beach the entire time. The fireworks started around 9:10. Me and Courtney had fun trying to dam the water from her Scooby-Doo blanket. The fireworks were pretty good. Some of them I've never seen before. But we had fun. The fireworks ended at 10, and we didn't get home until a little after midnight. It literally took 35 minutes to et out of our parking spot and we were out of the parking lot at 11. PIGS SUCK!! cops of course. 2 cops, standing at the intersection, directing traffic, wouldn't let our street go, so everyone was beeping at the pigs to let us go, it was ... idk. but it was still fun.
