      22 more days till summerschools over, thats a long ass time. Today i saw spiderman 2 finnally. it was allright, i expected it to be better but its all good. Man class sucked today. in english we were watching this gay as hell movie called village of the damned. it was about these little kids who could read minds. god damn it was so fuckin gay. Well during the movie me and a bunch of other guys were cracking up and making jodes and shit. i dont remember what i said but it was something about a monkey barmitsfa... yeah i dont know either. but anyways i said something about a monkey barmitsfa and then mr strappoli heared me and we had to stay late for an "after school session". he got superpissed and said that we would have a 200 point quiz tommorrow so that sucks but whatever its all good. spiderman started at 3:00 and i got there at 1. i was one of the first ones in line. allright well i gotta go now so ill see yall later.

      Today at skewl it was pretty good, it was better than yesterday. Yesterday was boring because noone knew anyone so it was all quiet, but now everyone started getting used to it so everyone was making jokes and stuff. it was pretty cool. football starts in a week and i cant wait for that. it is only 23 more days. for my graduation dad said he was gonna get me a drum set. that will be cool. but then again he said he was gonna get my moped but he didnt so i dont know. well obviously the silent treatment on my dad didnt work that well cause now im talking to him but whatever. my birthdays coming up and hopefully my bro will be out of the slammer by then but whatever. for my birthday my bro and my dad are gonna make another shak in the middle of the yard with the tv and the video games and all that. it will be awesome. but hopefully i will go to my sis's house first.allright i gotta go now so ill c ya later

      Today was my first day of summerschool and it sucked. its two hours a class so that seriously sucked. it is so annoying cause i have a teacher that thinks that hes cool but hes not. on the way home from school my dad and i started fighting over nothing so i said i wouldnt talk to him anymore but well see how that works out. crespi's pretty cool. julian goes there so at least im not alone. i problably wouldnt go to crespi if julian wasnt going but whatever. 24 more horrible days left damnit i cant wait. football practice starts on july 12 so that will be pretty cool. something to look forward to. but they might move me up to varsity. that would be alot more fun.

      20 more days of summmer school left. today was allright i guess. we had a 200 point test in english. i didnt read a word in the book so i totally bombed it. fuck i hope he doesnt call my parents. i also had to do a six page essay five minutes before due time. i finished 4 but couldnt finnish the other 2. oh well. Today in class some retard kid drew a penis on this kids white sweatshirt. what kind of a dumbass would do that. 4th of july is coming up. i dont have major plans, just gonna go out and watch some fireworks fly. i was hoping that tommorrow i could catch some surfing, but its not looking to good. my sister came home yesterday and shes been on my ass since about me doing my homework. but whatever. shes problably looking for me now so i got to go, later.
