      Hey babes~  okay my day was pretty good...all my ladies always know how to make my day better...its not that it was bad but i always am not the most Positive person alive so they always make me feel better...i just wish i'd be takin seriously sometimes and maybe even fricken NOTICED...but that's fine...tracks over so i'm pumped about that...cept schutt still hasta go for 2 more weeks...sry hun...i'm debating about goin to open gym tonight...prolly wont go...not until schools over...and GOOD luck wit ur chorus concert tonight merk and manda...hehe....but neways...all i really want to say is i wish u knew how i felt cuz that might change everything...yet it might not even matter...but i should wrap up...i'll update more later...Love ya all soo much...thanks for everything u've done...  Every picture's painted  differently . Every one has got a vision in their  mind . That  fills  the heart with answers, And the missin' piece that we  hope  to find. And this is  mine .  When I  feel  the world around me, How can I not  believe ? If I'm  high  up on a mountain, Or  down  on my knees, It's just  between  God and me.  peace dawgs...  --Sam--
