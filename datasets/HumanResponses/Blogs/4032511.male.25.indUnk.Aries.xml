      Ok it is not fair that someone that will remain nameless gets to hang out with all of our friends and I don't and he is the one that screwed me over.... Now I know that since I moved away it is my fault as well but I am beginning to hate this I am back with my family who is not hanging out and I only have two friends here in Michigan that want to hang out but not that much. I got used to my life in NM and I miss that life I miss everything about it.... the freedom , my own home, everyone of my friends from NM... I know my friend Michele is right  that I just have to get used to this life again and hopefully it will be soon and make new friends but the issue right now is that I have no idea how to go out and make new friends this is so damn stupid.... I try to go out and lend a hand at the glbt center here but they want me to wait until orientation yet they wont have another one of those for another month and then there is school which I don't have money for yet and then work which after just a week I don't have any hope on making friends.  Albuquerque may suck in ways but the people from Albuquerque rock because they are so nice and it is easy to make friends which is more then what I can say for Detroit.  *oh yeah I called and text message my ex again to get my stuff sent out because I am sick of waiting and yes I missed his voice a little and I know it is wrong but I still done it so blah*  *oh yeah my ex better not even use how I am feelin alone and missing NM..as fodder against me cuz he will regret it cuz i will post more HAHA j/k*

      Why do I keep on trying to touch base with Hans.&nbsp; I just got done b***him about how he is so rude and cold hearted to me and yet I was going through the pictures oh my cell phone and I found one of my cat miss kitty laying on Hans lap and it brought&nbsp;up a good memory so I decided to send it to him so I did and all I got was messages like he didn't really care it just ticked me off.

      Ok my ex begged me to still be friends with him and to talk to him every now and then and so on so I set aside my hurt and said ok to his request because of how long we were together but I find that if I call him because I need someone to talk to or to ask him to send some stuff I forgot he talks to me like I am a piece of s**t and it pisses me off.&nbsp; I admit I may not have been an angel but he was the one who screwed me over with his jerk off friend from Lansing (oh yeah guy in lansing all I have to say to you is meow I hope you can guess what I am tryin to say to you)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hans sounds so annoyed that I called him so I keep askin I will stop if you want me to but send me all my stuff and I will stop but he says declines that and says to keep callin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All I can do is stop callin him for the most part but damn I given up a lot and made sacrifices for him even to this day and he is so selfish he can't even talk to me if I am down in the dumps and I have no one else to talk to and believe it or not I am not always depressed because I use this blog site to get it out of my system.

       Ok 4 years of living in your own house and having total freedom and coming back to your parents house totally sucks.&nbsp; I feel that the house is on fire because once I get home from work I need to get away from my family and go to my room and chat on the web or go out with friends (which doesn't happen enough and I rather do that then chat on the web but its not avail)   well long bi**h short I don't want to be rude to my family because I love them to death and I know everything will fall into place but I think I need to live on my own or with a roomie inorder to communicate and have a good relationship with my family because I wont feel boxed in so I wont be on the defense and be a good son and brother.   all in all without boo having about the same things cuz they are getting better ( except the&nbsp;feeling of being alone)&nbsp;I am slowing getting back into the grind and trying not to fall back into computer all the time laziness which is on the boarder so I have to make sure as of tomorrow I do somethign other then check email and stuff right away and get caught up in conversations LOL.  Which didn't happen today because I went out with a friend for a few hours but I know people who just meet me are making cracks about me being online a lot but I do live my yahoo and AIM on all the time because I have cable modem.  Blah blah others things to worry about like treating my family like they are the most important people in the world cuz they are and that to learn to be with myself before I try to find someone else.&nbsp; So fighting the feeling and urge to meet someone new and start a relationship&nbsp; because I am feeling so alone is basically setting the loop on fire with the angel in one section of the loop and the devil on the other side fighting to break the loop blah I was seriously going somewhere with that but I am so sleepy i doubt it makes sense.  until next time

        Ok I am doing this Blog site right now because it helps me get through&nbsp;a lot of crap that I am going through&nbsp;in a way so if you are reading this and you don't know me don't get the wrong idea about me and think I am nuts because for the most part I am not LOL.&nbsp; I know that this blog will turn into something totally different later on down the road but it has only been a month since my life was turned upside down so bare with me and regular programming will return shortly.

      Moments like this I feel like I am the only one in this world.&nbsp; I am feeling so alone right now and it makes me wonder if I made the right choice in moving back to Michigan.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong I have two great friends in Michigan but they have their own life and they are different then my massive amount of friends in Albuquerque.&nbsp; My friends in NM (can) always&nbsp; hang out if not everyday at least once every other day.&nbsp; My friends in Michigan are different... They (can) (don't know if can is the right word) &nbsp;hang out maybe at least once a week and I can understand that and I love them just as much as I do my NM friends but it causes me to feel so alone.&nbsp; I know that this is how I used to live before I moved to New Mexico but I am glad I grew a lot since then because I was in a bubble.. My own world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that I need to make more friends out here in Michigan and the fact that I am starting work should help a bit because there are a lot of nice people but all those nice people are quitting so blah on that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am going to go back to school maybe even one class this fall if I can and I am even going to start volunteering at Affirmations Gay and lesbian community center starting the 10th of August.&nbsp;   I still feel at a loss right now and maybe this is the a test ... a test of my own character or whatever to show something but me thinks me is failin lol.&nbsp; I don't want to fall back into the same place that I was before I moved I want to go to the next level so to speak.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to prove my ex right that I would fall back into the same old grind... I know that I need some time to adjust to the time change and&nbsp; to everything blah blah blah.&nbsp;   ok my whole bitch session is basically over all said and done I guess I am trying to say that I am really lonely right now and I hate it more then anything.&nbsp; I have my family and they mean more then anything to me&nbsp;but that is complicated and a totally different topic.

      Ok incase anyone doesn't know I am a chub and I date chasers (thin guys who like bigger guys).&nbsp; Well, I been talking to a lot of chaser friends and half of them keep telling me how men are men and how they are naturally interested in sleeping with more then just one person.&nbsp; Well I have to say one thing to that.... BULL SH**.&nbsp; There are plenty of guys out there that when in a Long term relationship or whatever... never cheat on their boyfriend/girlfriend.&nbsp; So what I have to say to those who believe this is  GET A LIFE AND STOP TRYING TO DELUDE YOURSELVES FROM THE FACT THAT YOU R A WHORE WITH&nbsp;RELATIONSHIP ISSUES.&nbsp; Now to any of my friends who believe &nbsp;this I am sorry if I offended you but know I mean it but I still love you just the same as long as you didn't screw me over LOL.    Ok so enough said about that men believe it is ok to whore it up and cheat on their loved one. &nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like to fight what i just said then post once and that is it... if you want to say more then start your own damn blog site.

      Ok I started my new job today and it is ok.&nbsp; I am so thankful that I have a job but I want to let all my friend back in NM know that they should be&nbsp;happy with the 2 month traing that they get because all I get is a side by side monitoring that last a week to learn my job.&nbsp; All well it is a job and I get to make money and I am busy from 8am to 5pm so that rocks.  Ok so I keep getting IM's from guys that just want sex and not a relationship(I am not ready for a relationship as of yet but still this doesnt give me hope for the future)&nbsp;Don't get me wrong I am not a&nbsp;prude and I am not closed minded to&nbsp;sharing that with someone again but&nbsp;when &nbsp;someone contacts me and&nbsp;all they can say is lets meet up and f***&nbsp;&nbsp;... it just puts me off.&nbsp; Now I had this nice guy from up north (MI)&nbsp;IM'ed &nbsp;me about maybe starting to&nbsp;date but I let this guy know that I only want to go out as friends only and see what happens down the road but this guy told me that he had enough friends and he was looking to settle down.&nbsp; Well since then I haven't really heard from him so I just hope I didnt pass something good up.&nbsp;   I believe that I can be happy with someone else again but right now it is&nbsp;too soon cuz all I can do is think of something and how hans would like it or&nbsp;when I rent a movie and think how I would love to snuggle up with hans and watch it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that I am acting like Hans is the best guy on earth when he isn't and I realize that cuz he treated me like crap in a lot of ways which to this day&nbsp;he still doesn't see how he treated me&nbsp;and cuz of what he actually did to end our relationship.  Ok I know  BOO HOO

      Ok so it is 1am and I have to get up at 7am to get ready for my new job and I cannot sleep.&nbsp; I always get nervous like this before starting a new job and I did have something that would help me but umm that isn't avail unless I whore myself out... tee hee.&nbsp; Well anyway I am really nervous about starting a job here in Michigan because I guess it truly means that my life in New Mexico is truly over or over for at least now.&nbsp; I miss everyone of my friends in NM and I think I have been calling them way to much this weekend because of my damn unlimited&nbsp;minutes so I call them and keep b***in about my break up (its the continuous loop thing again LOL) ... I know that they understand my need to talk even if it is about the same thing because right now I am still getting over it and plus I have barely started to live again so I know as of next weekend I will have way more interesting stuff to talk about or at least I hope&nbsp;I know &nbsp;so.&nbsp;   Well today I didn't get to do much because I was all depressed because of my talk with my ex last night(yes I know I shouldn't talk to him but he was a major part of my life so it is hard not to want to get more closure on our relationship then I did which wasn't much at all) so I stayed up real late talking with friends in person, phone, online so I ended up sleeping a little late but then I decided to make this bloc site thanks to my friend Tia and Vanessa (love you both) After make this site I went to a bbq at an old friends house and it was great I love her and her place  I am also worried about a friend of mine i hope this friend realizes that they need help and i hope they get it. Ok got sidetracked and since I don't really have any order to how I am putting entries into my blog site I will end this entry and come back sometime maybe even tomorrow.   Nite

       Well.... this is a new start to my life...my continuous loop.&nbsp; When I say my continuous loop I am referring to what my exboyfriend..(the love of my life who broke my heart way before he ever cheated on me.).. often threw at me instead of having a two way conversation.&nbsp; My continuous loop which i will go into more at a later time is finally starting a new because it is the end of my life with my loved one hans in Albuquerque New Mexico and the start of my single life back in Detroit Michigan.&nbsp; I am doing this blog site to keep record for myself and my friends and even my ex who may become a friend one day so that if for some reason I cant bring myself to tell someone something I can write it on here to save me the trouble of not being able to say it while talking to someone that I care about and to make sure that if......oh hell just to keep everyone up to date.&nbsp; Since I have a bbq to get ready for I will write more later. Until then see you on the loop

       JOSH GROBAN LYRICS   Remember When It Rained  Wash away the thoughts inside That keep my mind away from you. No more love and no more pride And thoughts are all I have to do. Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. Felt the ground and looked up high And called your name. Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. In the darkness I remain. Tears of hope run down my skin. Tears for you that will not dry. They magnify the one within And let the outside slowly die. Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. I felt the ground and looked up high And called your name. Ohhhhhh Remember when it rained. In the water I remain Running down Running down Running down Running down Running down Running down Running down

      Ok now that I have gone nuts and freaked out a lot of people its time to for me to take back my life and start to enjoy being single.  Hell, I never once felt this good about myself or Did I ever really know myself as much as I do now.  Sure, like everyone else I have big areas that I need to improve myself (like letting things go and ignore jerks) so I am not saying that I wont have a moment where I get all sad about what has happened to me and that I won't need to talk to a friend about it but now with the help of my friend david , stan, and johnathan ( the kick in the ass that I so dearly needed)  I know I need to start planning ... planning to some degree what i want to do with myself what I want to be in store for my future and fight through any pain that I still will feel and the anger.  I am realizing that my life isnt hans that because i am not with him and he isnt who I thought he was doesnt mean that my life is over... I am very much alive and I am feeling life ... I,  just like everyone else in this world is going through a break up and feelin that pain and that pain i am feeling is what tells me that I am alive ...going back or is it thinking back to the good times I had with my ex and knowing how because of those good times I am a better person and I wouldn't change it for the world and I know that maybe one day I can talk to hans like a friend once we both get over our shit but if not I know that I am alive I have a life and that it is for me not to waste by worrying about what I have lost and ignore what I have gained or what I will gain.  It is so hard to get over something like this and I hope that if I have to go over something like this again that I can handle it better but I hope that I have a chance of going through this again because if I dont then that means I wont take a chance on finding love with another person and to me that would be the worst ... that I wouldnt allow another man in my life.

      Fallen Heaven Bend to take my handAnd lead me through the fireBe the long awaited answer To a long and painful fightTruth be told I tried my bestBut somewhere long the wayI got caught up in all there was to offerBut the cost was so much more than I could bear Though I've tried I've fallenI have sunk so lowI messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you so We all begin out with good intent When love is raw and youngWe believe that we can change ourselves The past can be undoneBut we carry on our back the burdens time always revealsIn the lonely light of morningIn the wound that would not healIt's the bitter taste of losing everything I've held so dear Though I've tried I've fallenI have sunk so lowI messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you so Heaven bend to take my hand I've nowhere left to turnI'm lost to these I thought were friendsTo everyone I knowOh they turn their heads embarrassed Pretend that they don't see That it's one wrong step one slip before you know it And there doesn't seem away to be redeemed Though I've tried I've fallenI have sunk so low I messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you soI messed up Better I should know So don't come round here and Tell me I told you so  ** I am just feelin this song right now**

      Instead of an email I called and told him off and it felt better then just sending an email..... I will never talk to him again because he hurt me more then someone who was my worst enemy. I hate him more then anything and now I think I can start letting it go now.

      Ok that was my rant to help get my feelings out after hearing the news that Hans decided to be with brad after telling me that he wasn't going to do it and probally using money that was supposed to help me pay my car payment to get back on track was used to buy the fat ars a plane ticket or 2 for a week of sex and DMB at my expense.   Oh yeah ,,, hans if you or brad read this oops I dont care cuz i may send you a copy of the letter and I will probally come back to it and edit it to make sense and to make sure it has my true feeling in it but i will know that you wont care.

      So hans lied to me again and he is with  brad the guy he cheated on me with.  He told me that he didn't want another relationship for sometime because he could think of no one other then me.  Well I should have known that was a damn lie because that is all he can do.

      This Monday felt just like any other Monday and it felt good. I must be on crack but it felt good even if I had to go to the doctors for woman problems (tee hee just kiddin). The gears are grinding and I am excited about that. I even heard how my ex been talkin crap and thinking lowly of me ( you know the one that didn't cheat and the one who worked his ass off to make the relationship work) ... well anyway it bothered me yet I am still going on and I fought the feeling of callin him and tellin him off for being a two faced weak minded jerk. umm ok so that helped me not call him as well LOL    Back to the GRIND.....

        Ok Dave and Stan remember how I sometimes replaced the word coke with another word that sounds familiar.. When I used to say I need a coke well I am doing it again and I said it in front of my father earlier today so I am really embarrassed and got the worst look from him. The word is something that every gay guy always want so if you can't guess what I said hit the x in the upper right hand corner of the window because your just sad LOL ( all my friends have a pass and can ask me)  It's not like I really need umm well you know because I can get it when ever I want ... I guess I was just reliving the silly times when we all hung out at Dave and Stan and walking to the store to get beer and coke.

        Some of my favorite quotes    1.   "Death is not extinguishing the light, it is putting out the candle because the Dawn has come."   (source unknown) (I do not know where I got this from but it somewhat helps me come to terms with death and losing someone you love.  2.    "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."      -Eleanor Roosevelt   I got this one wrote in my last high school year book from an old friend that I grew up with and I wish I still kept in touch with her. I hold this one dear to my heart because of my stature many people try to make me feel inferior for no damn reason.  3.    Love is like gas it will pass    - vanessa via unknown source.   Tee hee this one is great because my great friend vanessa told me this just two days after I got hans to tell me he cheated on me with brad. When vanessa told me this sayin I couldn't cry anymore I could only laugh and I am still laugh my ass off when I think of how much I miss hans but remember what he done to me and just tell myself that love is like gas and it will pass.     Please post and share your favorite quotes with me :)

      My Friend tia and hebba are right about the calling of my ex issue (as well as my friend dave).I know that I am finally at the point in this situation where I don't have to call or if I feel the need to call hans I can fight it but I will still call him to make sure he sends out my crap. Hebba said to make a new life with out ties to hans... I know that is important and I am trying to and it isn't easy but I know it will happen and I still feel that it sucks that I have to be the one to make a different life but whatever I know I chose that. All in all I was not prepaired for this because I was lead to believe that me and hans would have lasted the rest of our lives but I guess I finally got introduced to the real world. It's only been a month but I feel I am doing ok with dealing with this after all its not like the love of my life died... he just ended up not really being the love of my life.

      I have gotten to the point where I still and will always love my ex but I can't worry about what he thinks of me or my actions anymore.  Of course I still hear little things about him and what he thinks about what I do and I admit it bugs me just a little because he says things out of wanting to hurt me instead cuz he cares for me but I am at the point where I just don't care anymore.  I will always love him and hope that maybe one day we can at least talk or email and be friends but I think I finally made it to the point where I am not caring what he does and not caring what he thinks of what I am doing.    I just hope and wish that we could both can get over some things and become friends or whatever one day... I mean become friends if it is meant to be because after all he did do some pretty messed up things to me but whatever.

      Yeah I am bored again at work but I don't really feel to much like posting right now... I just have the same things to write about because I don't do anything interesting anymore :P.   OH OH Well all the responses from my area that i get from my personal are so sad because all of them have a b/f and that just ticks me off ... I think they are sorry for ever contacting me because I ripped them a new one and maybe with the next one I will get his number and let the b/f know that the other is cheating or at least planning to.   Oh yeah if any of my friends can get my mind off of my ex and his new b/f next week please do cuz it will be a sucky week for me.

      Ok I was bored here at work so I decided to look at the Oakland Community College web site  urlLink http://www.occ.cc.mi.us/  and I saw the online register thing so I decided to try it out and see if they still had me on record and they did ... they have me listed as open enrollment and in state and in district so I get to pay the cheapist rate. Guess who is going to school this semester .... timmy is yay :)   I am taking 6 credit hours Music history : history of rock and Social Science: Mass Media and society. I so can't wait.

      I am so shocked by how much I am enjoying writing in this blog.  I know I am just writing free style not worrying about gramar or anything else like that but I can't get over how much I am loving this.   Who knows maybe it will lead to other forms of writing... watch out world here comes the writer Tim.... umm ok maybe I wont go that far but I do feel like I have a new way of expressing my self that has always been avail to me but I just ignored it.

      Ok in reaction to my ex's new love interest I done something that I am not sure was right to do but since I paid for it I will use it.  I got a personal up at  urlLink http://www.biggercity.com/MITIM . I been getting maybe 2 or 3 people that are worth talking to but the rest (sorry if they read this) are just out for one thing.  I am happy with the nice friends I am making but feel weird about the other contacts I am recieving.  I know I need to rework what my personal says so if you read it and have suggestions let me know.   Oh yes to my friends that think I should take it down I won't bedcause I paid for 3 months and I am going to keep it but help me make it better to find friends then.  *first off ...watch out now that I am at work with hardly any work to do I will post more... I know scarry*

      Have I been a bad friend as of late?  I know that I have been and still is wrapped up in my little drama or whatever you want to call it but apart of me feels that I let down my friends that I do have because of it.  I am speaking mostly of my friends in NM because I am 1600 miles away and I am having them as my only support system and just recently not paying attention to their needs.  So have I been a bad friend as of late? For the friends here in MI I feel that I am to demanding because I would like to hang out every other day with them but they are not like that and before I moved nor was I... I have changed and so have they ... we have moved apart in ways and I wish we were more closer but I know it is wrong for me to expect them to change their busy lives to make room for mebut then get hurt cuz they didn't... Have I been a good friend to them?

      Ok here I am at work waiting for calls to come in and just feeling myself back on a loop.  When I say back on a loop I mean that I am going back to the way I been feeling about hans and how I was before I met him and moved out to New Mexico.  First off the way i am feeling about hans is causing me to dream /have nightmares about chasing after him and waking up really sad because he is not at my side when I wake up I start to feel sad all over again... now the feelings arent as strong as they used to be but I know the week he has his new b/f down to visit ..that it will be hell for me even though I am 1600 miles away.  And now for the fact that I feel like I am back to where I was before I loved to New Mexico... I have a few friends that don't like to hang out or if they do want to hang out it is only once a week so I end up stayin home in my room feeling all depressed.  I hate it so much cuz i try to go out on my own and do some new things yet I end up getting lost or end up not finding anything and going back home.  Well because of this I was talkin to a friend of mine from online... her name is jeri and I known her for 10 years. she helped me come out so she really rocks but anyway she just moved to New Orleans and has offered me a room in her house for cheap and because of the way I feel here I am temped to go but I promised my friend Dave who means the world to me that I wouldn't go that I would stick it out here in MI so I guess I will have to do that because apart of me knows he is right and it is the best thing to do even if I want to run away to New orleans and start a new life and plus that would really hurt and tick my family off. OH what to do...... I don't know all I know is I hope things get better and I start making new friends but so far it is not working....

      Ok I talked with my old friend Kristin that I met when I was back in High School and starting a Gay straight alliance. Well long story short she was all into it but she has changed to where she is not even lesbian now and I don't mind that at all cuz it does and can happen and I am happy that she knows who she truly is meant to love but I had an hour debate with her about Christianity and I am very sad because she is an extremist now and I thought that because of how smart she is that she could never be ran through like this I mean I don't dislike that she is Christian but I am hurt that she let her self go into the far right of it and say gays are going to hell or something like that.... I know that I couldn't change the way she feels but I did stand strong with my beliefs and I hope that we will still be friends because I can respect her and love her and still disagree with what she believes when it comes to gays and religion.

      Well today is a better day because I am not thinking about stuff or worring about stuff in which I have no control over... I finally got a bank account and I am getting a better idea of how much money I will be per pay check so that is going to help me figure out when I can get my bills caught up.  It also helped me determined to keep my eyes open for a part time job on the weekends because I miss that extra 3.33 an hour from my old job.  Things are weird ...weird being alone but like I said life is finally starting to rotate gain....

      all I have to say is blah.... I can't do anything right or so it seems... I can't turn my feelings off when I should... I can't stop thinking about certain events even though i think of them a whole lot less and it seems to be getting fewer... I can't stop reaching out to those who hurt me because I am feeling all alone... I can't stop buggin my friends in NM ... I can't stop thinkin gthat I am doing something wrong and I truely dont know if I am doing something wrong or whatever... I am just glad that I keep working and not let anything get in the way of it ... even thought right now I feel I am working for nothing because I am so behind in bills....  I miss my life in NM but I know I need to make a new one for me here in MI. I know I need to live a life that is centered on me and improving myself yet I still feel a need to share it with someone ... and when I mean share I mean even if it is just friendship. What i dont get is that i know what I should do but I am finding it so hard to actually do it...  this is just me bitching because I plan on not bitching to any friends face to face anymore no need to replycuz i know i am being a punk ass bitch and I need to shut the f up and just do what i need to do...

      I do I do.:... I have been wronged by my ex but I dont care anymore... I dont care to let him know that I am doing well or what I am doing... I dont care to know what he is doing anymore... I gave all I could give and he still screwed me over and I am fine with that now I am fine with him being with someone else  ... there is just so much pain that I can feel or allow myself to feel. There is just so much that I can be there for others and care for those who caused me pain... I will always want him to be safe and life a long life but I dont know or care to decide right now if I want to be apart of his life....... I want to be alone and away from him and away from hearing about him... I give up on him ... I give up on a lot of things..... My spirit is broken... I am broken... its not about poor me the love of my life hurt and wronged me so...  it is about me now and only me.... I need to get to know myself again and repair what I feel is shattered ...to repair my faith in relationships my faith in myself... and my abliity to trust again and repair my ablitiy to care again.   I can see things about hans now that I couldnt see before and I pity him even thought he doesnt need my pity... I am still hurt but I don't care... I just don't care about anythign anymore and that scares me... I need to find that again and hope i find it before something... before something........before I give up on everything and really drop off the face of the earth one way or another... really i am not depressed or anything I just find myself not caring for anything anymore... i could move away from my family and from my friends  and not be found until i wanted to be found.... but I would be feeling the same as I feel now so I will stay and go to school and learn and that will be my life ,,, yet I still will not care about anything ... or feel that I dont care fo ranything ... who am I kiddin this is justa  feeling ... just a temp feeling ... I still care for things but I know i don tcare about hans anymore I dont care about anything I have love for him but i dont care for him........  I am just mixed up about my thought but i am not mixed up about knowing that I will never be with him again and knowing he is the one to fuck up... i know i dont need or want to talk to him for a while because if I did talk to him it would be just to make him feel better and he should feel all the lonlyiness in the world.................  Did reading this make your head hurt???? Well welcome to my world right now...
