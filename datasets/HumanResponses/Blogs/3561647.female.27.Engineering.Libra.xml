						   "Godliness with contentment is great gain"  - 1 Timothy 6:6 NIV   The world's concept of happiness is getting what we want. All merchandising is based  o n  this idea. To really be happy, we need a flashier car, a sexier cologne, shapelier bodies,  or any number of items that are better, faster or easier to use than what we already have.  We watch the commercials, read the ads, and pursue all the latest fashions, fads and  fancy doodads. We buy into the lie that we're not really happy until we get what we want.   God's concept of happiness is summed up in the simple proverb: "Happy is the man who  wants what he has." As long as you are focusing on what you don't have, you'll be unhappy.  But when you begin to appreciate what you already have, you'll begin to experience the joys  of life. Paul wrote to Timothy: "Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought  nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing,  we will be content with that.." (1 Timothy 6:6-8 NIV).   Actually, you already have everything you need to live a joyful life. You  not only have jobs in an air conditioned room, three (or more) square meals, trendy and  high-tech gizmos, etc.  Not only you do have the freedom to exercise your faith but most  importantly, you have Jesus Christ. You have eternal life. You are loved by a heavenly Father  who has promised to supply all your needs. No wonder the Bible repeatedly commands us to be  thankful (1 Thessalonians 5:18). If you really want to be happy, learn to be  thankful for what you have and not covet what you don't have. Count your blessings!

						   A LITTLE BIT   I was kinda hesitant to tell you  Should I let you know?  I was never really like this before  Need I say more?  Or maybe Im confused that you are near me  I dont know what to do or I should be  There's only one thing in my mind  That's you and me  Im a little bit of crazy  Im a little bit of a fool  Im a little bit of lonely  Im a little bit of all  Oh I need a cure  Just a little bit of you  And I will fall  Im always on the run to see you  Would you allow me to?  It wasnt my intention to hurt you  this feeling is true

						   last night when i was going to work i was already inside the jeepney when i found out that i forgot my wallet good thing i wasn't that far from the gate of the village yet,when i found out about my wallet i immediately took off the jeepney and headed way back home.i went straight to my bf's house which incidentally just 3 houses away from mine.when i called and i was standing i front of their house,when he went out i saw him dressed in basketball uniform,and his friend,he was a abit shocked,he didn't expect it.he asked me why i was there that i supposed to be on my way to office,i told him,i forgot my wallet.first we were together before i went to work and he didn't tell me anything about their basketball pratice.i didn't show any sign of resentment coz i didn't to go to office with heavy heart or feeling,so i went to work and i got home,i went straight to their house to eat breakfast, he's feeling me,if was mad,he told me"i know you're mad",i didn't show him any hard feeling in front of his brother,it's because i tried to be civil and still showed some respect,and when i went to my pad ( i'm renting a room 3 houses away from his house...sounds confusing to some,,i know)that's when i talked to him,i dunno if i got point to get mad for not asking permission from for his basketball practice and i know some of you wouldn't understand me,an dyou may even think,i have no right feel that way,just because of not asking permission.but anyways,bottomline,we're okay now...do i have all the right to feel that...
