      Hello my friends. Today was really fun. Well not really fun but yeh. At lunch I was sitting with my friends and i was eating pretzels =D. We kinda did something inappropriate at school but yeh, we cleaned it up after that. We were throwing pretzels at eachother. Which was pretty fun, for what I have to say. I didn't started it of course, cause im such a good boy ^_^. It was a pretty good pretzel fight. Even though i was just sitting down the whole time watching them =b. I only threw a few, but i eventually picked them up and started eating it, just playing =b. Well, I'm here in 5th period posting my blogger like Mrs. Spacek sayss. However im real mad, why you ask? Well, ITS BECAUSE I HAVE A B+ IN PE, andi don't like it cause i usually get a 3.83 GPA all year this year, and my goal this quater was to get a 4.0 GPA. I'm pretty mad cause now i lost it >=/. I have Mrs. Glover 1st period and she said I have a B+ becaus i didn't turn in my worksheet, which i had just yesterday but i left it at home and now im realy MAD BECAUUSE THERE GOES MY 4.0 GPA. ^_^ Maybe you should talk to her Mrs. Spacek, i would really appreciate it if you do. Okie dokie, bye.

      School is fun and all, but lately I've been really tired. At home I can barely sleep because my mom is taking out the whole kitchen, in other words, they're remodeling my kitchen. I saw a preview of it and so far so good. It loooked really nice and yeh. However, i felt like I've lost my privacy because my parents are also getting new doors  for the whole house. O.O I felt like i lost my privacy because now i don't even have a door to my room or the bathroom. So yeh, I feel kinda violated and uncomfortable at the moment =b. Well, back to reading Tangerine.

      Today was pretty boring. Yesterday Phi challeneged my friends and I to a basketball game for today. However, when we got to the basketball courts they ddin't even have enough ball for us to go around so we can play a game. So, i went to the leadership room to buy a Chaboya 2004 T-shirt, but they didn't have my size. They didn't have a medium so i was pretty mad and ticked off because i really wanted one. I ate a bag of chips for lunch and it wasn't very good because im getting sick and tired of the food we have here at Chaboya, so here i am typing in my blog in 5th period and yeh.

      The story Tangerine is about a boy name Paul Fisher. Paul is a boy that loves to play soccer and he moved to Tangerine, Florida because his dad got a new job. It always rained in Tangerine and its dangerous becaues lighting can strike someone and kill them. Paul has troubling seeing when he was a little baby, but he didn't know why he has to wear glasses or how he got them. His parents on the other hand, told him that he got it from an eclipse from th sun because he was looking at the sun. So now, Paul wears glasses and he has a big brohter name Eric. Eric is a superstar football player. He has a great future in football. Eric is 4 years older than Paul. They both now live in Tangerine, Florida, and as the story goes on, Paul finds more information about his terrible past.

      I'm real tired. I didn't really get enough sleep last night because my kitchen and door is being remodeled right now. I can't even use to kitchen or anything. My door is being painted right now, and so is the bathroom door. My mom told me that i can't touch it or else I would be in real trouble. So i decided not to touch it or anything. Jose right now is learning how to do his IMovie, he's doing a great job. He's getting the basics and everything.

MY FRIEND GOT MY YEARBOOK DIRTY AND IT REALLY GOT ME MAD BECAUSE ITS ONLY DA FIRST DAY. Man, people have no respect for other people's property jeez. Well, now I'm here in one of my favorite teachers classroom, Mrs. Spacek of course =b, and now i have to do my ABC Summery. Bye ^_^
