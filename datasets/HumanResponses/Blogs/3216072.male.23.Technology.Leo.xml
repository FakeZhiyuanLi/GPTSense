      "Waaa Cha Taaa Suoe Liieddyyy" the little Chinese lady sang. Her music blaring and the kids in the back could only stare in disbelief. She wasn't going fast enough to be getting into the fast lane, but as usual she was oblivious to her driving.  "Cheee Teaaaa Kwaannn DOOOO!" she sang on. Still the kids mouths hung wide. All of the sudden she realized just in the nick of time that the car she was coming up on wasn't going fast. "Wa da fuck is dis foo doin?" she said with a thick accent still left over from her time in china. She was trying to figure out what to do quick. So she swerved to her right.  Crash! "Oh shi!" she screamed as she realized she had hit another car. The car started spinning out of control. Then it started to flip end over end. Like something you would see out of an elaborate car chase filmed by a Hollywood director. All she could do was put her hands on the roof and scream "WEEEEE!".  After the car had stopped flipping and came to a rest on the roof of the van. She looked back at the kids and asked them if they had as much fun as she had. They just stared back with blank expressionless faces. "Oh, wow, I wan do again." she said as she started to crawl out of the car.  As the police arrived on the scene. They saw only a little Chinese lady grasping what looked to be two child size dolls. As the police approached the Chinese lady they asked, "Are you OK?". The Chinese Lady said "Oh, I fine, want do again, but children do not." The police stared at each other for a moment then realized she was talking about the mannequins.  She currently resides in your local Mental Institution...

      Thought this was a neat article by Reuters at Yahoo. Pretty much talking about a blog that is done by an unknown actor/actress in Hollywood and their life...  out

      Yesterday I was in the middle of  urlLink killing kittens  when I decided to stop. I was going to save all the little kittens. So got up right then and there and pledged my allegiance to all the kittens of the world.  Later that night I found my self down at the local pub having no luck. Wishing my pledge had never been spoke into existence. I decided the best thing was to go hoggin'. So I found the biggest most fat lady at the bar and took her out to the country. I told her all the things I wanted to do to her in the pasture under the stars.  After all that I left her out there and headed home. Ahh, what a feeling. Not having to worry about my friends finding out what I had done, but wait...There was one of my friends walking on the side of the road. I stopped to ask what he was doing out here and told him to climb in.  His response was simply a hoggin' gone bad. Turns out his big girl new the scam and left him out in the middle of no where. Guess what comes around goes around. So the conversation turned to me and I decided I could tell him the truth. Well needless to say we had a good laugh and no little kittens got killed.  Thank God...

      This article written by KATIE HAFNER at the New York Times is pretty good. I think it explains how blogging can get a hold of you and gives a few good links. Me I do really enjoy posting to my blog. I haven't in a couple days, because well, I had nothing really to write about. Not to mention I was experimenting with a few other blogs that I deleted. I just decided to put it all here.  out

      To get a reaction from people you must cause them to react. This is easier done than said. On my way home from work tonight, I decided to drive 45 in the fast lane. Let me tell you it was very fulfilling to know that I brought frustration into the hearts of so many of my fellow commuters. Yes there are people right now still cursing my name out there just sitting and waiting to get home.  I don't know what came over me really but it was great. At first people would just fly by me at twice my speed and blow their annoying ass horns. Then one guy who got trapped behind me got as close to my ass as he could and stayed there for too long blowing him self...I mean his horn. Then he proceeded to pull up next to me and it looked like he was trying to cuss me out. As for me, I just smiled back and gave him a pleasant wave with my middle finger. Thinking all the while "What a bitch!".  What happened next made this brilliant idea of mine all the more worth it. The infamous Chinese lady we all know and hate, going around 60 decided to get behind me and did not know what to do. So then in a sudden move she tries to swerve over and BAM! I see her car go flying end over end. The look on her face should have been the next Master Card commercial... Priceless!  So I figured with the days accomplishment under my belt I had better go ahead and join my fellow motorists at a normal 80 miles an hour and call it a day. When I got home I decided to enjoy my handy work by turning on the news. Sure enough there was a special report on about the highway that had to be shut down. And wouldn't you know the President was in town to add to the confusion.  Yes, when it has to be done, do it right. I have to say the joy it brought me and the closer I had was intense. I was finally able to get back at all the little Chinese women that decided to cut me off in traffic and do 20 under the speed limit. Score one for the coalition.

      Today, I decided to call a lawyer and file for bankruptcy. Not that I really need to or anything. I just wanted to fuck myself. Not to mention the fact that I am tired of paying bills. Actually I am just tired of them piling up next to the Martha Stewart catalog. I guess one day I just decided to stop being left out. I mean every one else is fucking me why shouldn't I have a turn.  So I called this lawyer. Let's say his name was Bob. Yea Bob the lawyer. What a guy. He said he could walk me through the whole process. Hell, he would even throw in the first consultation for half price. Half price? "What is half price?" I asked bob. "Well" he says in a southern drawl, "Full price of a consultation is 200.00 dollars and that's the best deal in town!". That's the best deal in town? "Well, Bob what's one of these darn things normally run a fella like me?" I had to ask.  Well after he told me the price, I just had to ask one more question "Well that doesn't sound to bad there Bob, but can I roll that into my bankruptcy along with my other bills?". Needless to say I have to find a new lawyer. Guess ole Bob the lawyer didn't see the humor. I imagine I am going to have to approach this a different way. So I picked the next blood sucker in the list and reached for the phone.

       Plagued by the insecurities brought on by others.  He sees only a tunnel with no outcome.  Never fighting for what is right.  Finding lost causes in every room of his hidden thoughts.  Wanting nothing.  Feeling too much.   Letting the water flood the vessel with only doubt.  Drowning in a sea of forgotten souls.  Screaming with no voice. Holding on with no hands. He follows the red, but leads the grey. He is not, but never to be.

      The sun was bright finally after so many rainy days. I was happy to see my old friend the sun, so that I could where my sunglasses again. "I love these things!", I said aloud while putting them on. And looking into the mirror only reinforced the feeling. I had had this particular pair of sunglasses for only about 2 years. I found them at a gas station one day on the way to my great-grandmothers funeral. I am always on the look out for a good pair of sunglasses, but on the sorrowful day I found the most best pair in the world. I only wore them on special occasions, and today was one of those occasions. The occasion was only that it was sunny.  I had a few errands to run before going to work, so I gave my boss a call and said I was going to be late. I got out to the Jeep and started taking the top off. Oh, what a great day it's going to be, I couldn't help but think. At that moment my neighbor walked up to me and complemented me on my sunglasses. Now this neighbor wasn't just any neighbor but the neighbor. You know the one we all have down the street that you only dream of hooking up with. So we started talking about sunglasses and the weather and before you know it I had a date that night.  On my way to the back I was all smiles. As I was approaching the infamous red-light right before the bank I gunned it and as always it turned yellow just in time to make me stop. "Damn!" I heard a lady's voice say beside me. When I looked over I saw that it was my Senior year Prom Queen. What luck, I thought, could it be the glasses? So I said "Hey, what's it been five, six years?" "Oh my god, is that really you?" I gave a big smile and replied "In the flesh!" So we pulled into the back and got out of the cars. First thing I hear "I like those glasses! Where did you get them?"  I said simply "At a gas station a while back.". So we got to talking and catching up. It was a very interesting conversation cause she kept flirting. I couldn't help my self either cause she had only improved with time and of course she complemented my glasses. So after about a good fifteen or so minutes and another date, I started for the back. Man I can do no wrong today, was all I could think on my way in.  When I got into the back it was time. I pulled out my hand cannon and let three fly. To my astonishment right as I did that some jerk leaned over in the path of what were only meant to be warning shots. Two of the three hit him the head and neck, respectively. Blood went everywhere and he went down like a sack of potatoes. I hadn't meant to aim so low but I couldn't really see that well cause I had left my sunglasses on, but luckily I had slipped on my mask and left the car running. So back out the door I went with my ill gotten gains. I jumped in my car and started for the street and wouldn't you know a cop was pulling in and took notice to the fact that I was speeding off with a mask on. "Oh shit!" I heard the words coming out of my mouth as I realized that if it weren't for the mask I probably would have gotten away. I saw the blue lights come on.  With out a moments delay and with the mask still on I put the jeep to work. I jumped the curb and went through the light barely missing oncoming traffic. I looked back in just enough time to see the cop get side swiped. Man my luck had turned I thought. So I took the mask off. I couldn't help but think that maybe next time I would leave my sunglasses off during a back robbery. When I got home I washed the red paint off the Jeep to show the black paint underneath. I changed the license plate back to the original that was registered to me and disposed of the old one in the trash.  After a day like that I decided to have a drink and to call out of work. I picked up the line to call the neighbor to see what she was doing later that day. She was free and said she would love to come over to go out. When she got to the house we made small talk about a bank robbery she had seen on the news where a man had been severly injured and was in the hospital. I decided to lay low that night and we stayed in. I will leave the rest to imagination...

      Driving into work it seemed it was going to be the norm for me today. Traffic was awful as usual, and with the windows down the smell of exhaust fumes was as potent as ever. It took me, as it always does, an hour to make the 15 mile hike down the highway to my office. I grabbed my parking place in the back of the lot, and walked the normal five minutes to the nine story building. All the while giving a polite nod to fellow co-workers that I have never met and really don't care too.  "Damn" I said under my breath when I realized I had forgotten my security badge in the car as I got to the elevator. I guess one of the guys that works on my floor realized why I had said this, and said "Don't you hate it when that happens?". "Yea man I'll see ya up there in ten." I replied as I started the trek back out to the car. Man, I have to do this at least twice if not three times a month. So I lit a cigarette when I got out of the building, nodded to a lady running into the building trying to get to her desk on time. That was something I stopped trying to do years ago.  As I walked back into the lobby of the building I noticed there was a commotion going on over by the elevators. When I got there I asked what was going on. Apparently one of the elevators cable broke and fell a couple floors before the brakes stopped it. No one was hurt but they were all a little shook up. I couldn't help but to think that I was lucky to not be on that elevator, because it was the one I was going to get on.  The work day was pretty much routine after that and at lunch I decided I would go out instead of eating my lunch that I had brought from home. Walking to the elevator I was stopped by my boos who just wanted to make small talk. Which intern made me miss the elevator, the one that didn't break. So I pushed the little down button and waited for it to come back. Luckily I was able to get on by myself. I hate that awkward silence between two passengers on an elevator.  A feeling came over that I didn't like at the eighth floor, and that is when it happened. All the power was lost and the elevator stopped between the the seventh and eighth floor. "Great just my luck!" I said to no one. So I sat there waiting for the emergency lights to come on, but after a couple of minutes I decided that I would have no such luck. Reaching for my lighter I could only hear the creaking of the elevator in a hollow shaft. Then snap and I heard a loud noise and what sounded to be the other elevator falling. Aloud crash shook the whole building, and the elevator I was in shook even more violently. What is going on I thought to myself in disbelief reaching for the hand rail to brace my self.   With my lighter in hand I looked for the emergency phone. Picking it up I heard the dial tone and then the phone started ringing. It must have rang thirty times with no answer, so hoping that maybe someone had noticed that this elevator had gotten stuck I yelled out. I kept yelling not so much frantic, but more like annoyed. After 5 minutes I decided I would stop with the yelling and just waited it out. Someone was bound to check this damned moving room I was trapped in.   "Christ, its been an hour and still nothing." I was thinking out loud. I went back to my lighter and decided I needed a cigarette. I mean you keep me locked up in here for this long making me miss my lunch with no word. It was the least that I deserved. I figured they must have shut this one down and forgot to look to see if anyone was in here in all the confusion that the other one falling must have brought on. Yet still time crept by.  A pack of gum and 6 cigarettes later, I decided that this was getting ridiculous. So I grabbed the lighter and went looking for that latch you always see them use in the movies. Click! "Ahh, there it is" I said out loud my voice a little horse from not really using it for the past couple of hours. As I claimed up to the top of the car I could see the top half of the eighth floor door. As I got up to it I decided to knock on it, hoping to get someone's attention. No luck! Man what in the world is going on I had to wonder.  After trying to pry the doors open and failing miserably. I remembered that sometimes they had a latch or some type of mechanism to open these doors from the shaft. I finally found what I was looking for just as I was about to give up. It was towards the top and looked like just a little wire, but it got the job done and I stepped out onto the eighth floor. Man what a horrible experience I was thinking to my self as I started looking around for someone. Knowing I couldn't get access to the main part of the eighth floor only the bathrooms I decided to take the stairs back up to nine.  As I walked onto the floor and into the main room I noticed something odd about it all. There was no one there! "What the fuck?" I heard myself say as I walked around looking for any sign of life. Guess this is the reason no one found me. They must have evacuated due to one of the elevators falling, I started to think. So I figured it best that I do the same. As I started down the stairwell I noticed I didn't see and of the doors that led out to the offices on any of the floors. They were just not there! So I darted back up to nine and it was gone as well. "No way!" I said loud enough for it to echo down the stair well. I couldn't help but think did someone slip me something or am I loosing my mind.  At the bottom of the stairs on the lobby floor the door was there. Just the thought of that seemed so perplexing and silly. When I looked back to make sure I wasn't just imagining it all, the stairs were gone! "Ok I really am loosing it!" I said looking at an empty shaft that runs all the way to the top of the building. Now I was in a panic! I ran out into the lobby through the main doors and into what I can only describe and the most beautiful forest I had ever laid eyes one. I could barely breath for the air being so clean and sweet. Slowly the thoughts of what I had just experienced drifted from my mind as if it had never happened.  I looked back to see the building and only saw trees with the clearest stream that anyone had ever laid eyes on winding through them. Suddenly I didn't know why I was looking for a building or what one was for that matter. What was happening I would never know. For all thoughts off that past, that I now hadn't lived, left me. I was in a new world that was known to me only as home. It was an ancient place before civilization. I was one of the greatest hunters my tribe had ever produced. And I was on a trip with my weapon in hand, determined to kill.

      Standing in the front yard looking up at the pair of intruders I new I was in a predicament. With my girl standing next to me and a set of barrels pointed at me it was time to react to this situation. The reason for these men to be at my house alluded me. I could think of no reason for this and it angered me. I wanted them to die as much as it seemed they wanted me dead.  With no further delay I moved to the left towards the truck. Out of nowhere as if some ungodly gift my two guns sprang from the ground. I knew this was caused by the lever my foot had triggered in my sudden movement. Barrels pointing towards the ground and handles moving toward my hands through the air, it seemed time stood still.  My gaze never left the peripheral view of the two villains sent to me. I didn't hear the sounds of their guns, but only witnessed the muzzle flashes. The handguns landed perfectly in my grip. My trigger finger tapped the barrel right above the trigger, as I acquired my targets. My arms straight by my side pointing in the direction of when I had received my two gifts. Still moving to the left in the midst of dust flying from the ground I methodically raised my weapons.  Two shoots fired one right after another. This was when I reached the truck bed. I tucked my left shoulder and spun so my back would touch the top of the bed sides.  I was now totally horizontal which allowed me to spin one last time to land on my back in the bed of the truck. My arms at a ninety degree angle with the gun barrel beside my head. I was waiting for more fire, but I heard only screaming start from the girl I left unattended.  I got to my knees to find my two opponents lying on the porch. I turned my sights on her. She looked to be ok. I jumped from the truck and went to her. Looking her over she truly was physically ok. They had come for me and only for me. They were professionals that didn't mind witnesses. What was I up against here? As I walked up to the two unfortunates, I vowed to find out.

      This night was dark and stormy. I was drunk and looking for a place to get out of the rain. I saw a small boy standing in front of an alley. The boy disfigured stood there waving at something in the alley. As I approached I must have startled him cause he looked my way, without making eye contact. Then like that there was nothing he was gone. When I rounded the corner of the alley to see what the boy had been waving at I saw that it was empty.  Standing there puzzled I looked around to see if anyone had just witnessed these events. Finding no one was around I decided to go to the doorway halfway down the alley and have a seat. It was dry here and a little bare light shown on the ground from above. I had been sitting there for a couple of minutes when I heard something back at street where I had just come from. It was the boy standing there just staring at me.  I just looked at him for a minute before I decided to make contact with the kid. I called out to him and asked if he was ok. He just kept staring. As I started to get up to walk towards the boy he took a step in my direction. I stopped and tried to look a little closer but the rain made it hard to see. His hair hung down over his brow and he made me think of someone I used to know.  Standing there in the rain I couldn't quite make it out, but he did look familiar. I started to walk closer, but this time the boy took a step backwards and looked down the street. As if to say I will run again if you come any closer, but in my state of mind I paid it no attention. I tried to speak to the boy again. I told him it was ok I just wanted to look at him. This seemed to bother him, but he stayed as I came closer. When I reached him I could see that he did have similar features to a childhood friend I once had. I stood there looking down at this boy who stood there looking up at this man. His lip looked like someone had pulled it in two and let it grow back separated. I couldn't stop staring at it. I felt myself reach out and try to touch his disfigurement, but the boy slapped my hand away.  "I am sorry" I told the boy and asked if he had a name. He said that he had forgotten what it was, but his mother knew. By this time the alcohol was wearing thin and I was getting cold from the rain. The boy must have noticed, because he asked me if I would like to come with him to a place out of the rain. As I stumbled after the boy with no name I realized that he also walked with a slight limp. When we arrived at our destination I looked up and saw what appeared to be an extravagant hotel in its day. Now it looked run down almost to the point where the city should condemn the place. Then I heard a buzzing noise that startled me a bit. When I looked I saw the boy, pressing a button on an intercom that hung from its original place in the wall by its wires.  There were no words spoken and I saw no heads appear from the windows above. Just a buzzing noise followed by a click of the lock. As I followed the boy into the dimly lit hallway I could only think of how wet and dark the inside looked. The wooden floor creaked with every step we took. The furniture must have been exquisite in its day, but now looked rotting and discolored. We came to an empty elevator shaft at the end of the Hall. There the boy stopped and looked up the shaft. "The vator must not be working again" he said as he pulled open the door to the stairwell. I followed him in and up countless flights of stairs all the way to the top floor. There on the door hung the number four beside the outline of a one that had long since fallen off.  Into a new hall that resembled the lower floor, but with a deep blue wall paper that was striped away in places. I heard the muffled voice of my little friend say that we are almost to our destination. I watched him enter a doorway with no door. As I rounded the same path I felt as though I had entered another world. It was a living room of sorts with a few people still lingering. I watched an old man seated in front of a had of poker lean towards the boy and ask a question. He slid his eyes up at me in such a manner I knew the question that was being asked. The boy looked back at me and apparently  told the old man what he wanted to hear. The man just tipped his head and resumed playing his game. It struck me odd though that he was playing poker by him self.  This room had only a light on in the back behind some sort of make shift bar, But the whole room flicked from the TV. A woman no older than I sat in front of the TV as if we had never entered just starring into the muted set. Such an odd place this little fellow has brought me, but how could I complain. I now had a place to lay my head.  We sat towards the back of the room where there was no one to bother us. He sat there on the red velvet couch next to a rip that allowed you to see the springs inside. He was starring at me as if he was waiting for the next thing I was to say. "So where is your mother" I said looking for some resolution to the nights events. The boy got up and told me that he needed to go to his room, but I could stay there till morning. When he would come back to wake me.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man in all black stepped from the car, into a world he could no longer endure. He had seen too many of humanities people doing unspeakable things. He himself had not only witnessed them, but led some of the worst. The winner called them untold victories, but the looser was not left to have an account. It was a growing burden that he feared could not be lifted. Yet he stood here in front of this building&nbsp;of which&nbsp;he could not count the number of floors, preparing to win another. Why he kept on with this charade after all justification was lost he&nbsp;could not say. He just knew that he was born with a gift, and he needed to weld this gift for his purpose. No longer was his purpose, their purpose.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not noticing anything that mattered he entered the building and stepped up to the information desk. Finding the name he was looking for with out the help of the attendant he looked toward the elevator. During the ride to the fourteenth floor he was alone. Knowing there was a camera located above the round buttons on the left panel, he kept his guns in their holster. His eyes never strayed from the digital screen with numbers ascending to the eminent death of his next victim. With the chime of a bell the doors slid to the side and the hallway that was laid before him seemed never ending. Within the first few steps he had drawn both guns from beneath his floor length leather coat and started to prepare to take life.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He found the door which was located further from the elevated than he had hoped, but still he knew that it would not matter. He stood there for a moment in silence with his arms hanging at his side. Then with a quick movement the door shattered into pieces and exploded inwards. From the sound of hysteria inside the room he knew the element of surprise was achieved. He walked in as if he were a welcomed guest with the guns still by his side. The fragments of the door seemed to float in the air around him. He could watch debris of all sizes brush of his coat as he moved through the wreckage. Time it seemed slowed to a crawl at his command. Turning to the desk using the confusion he’d caused to his benefit he started to acquire his target. Then he realized he was watching a bullet slip out of a muzzle pointed at him. At this instant he realized for the first time that not moving out of the path of this bullet could be his only peace. Still the will to live was too great. With his eye on the passing bullet he raised his right arm and put the gun on the head of the man sitting behind the desk. With a silent prayer he pulled the trigger as the bullet meant for him struck the far wall.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene he was left with was one he was all too familiar with. Then it seemed that time could not go slow enough. He knew that he had to escape unseen, but that others had heard what just happened. He walked to the door and peeked out both ways and seeing no one was coming to investigate what had just taken place he sprinted for the elevator thankful he had jarred the door.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The elevator seemed to close in around him as the fatigue set in. He tried to calm himself so that he could walk out of the building as if he belonged there. He holstered his weapons as the doors slid open to the eighth floor and a lady that took no notice of him stepped on. This was reassuring that the alarm had not been sounded yet. Maybe I’ll have time to get out unnoticed he thought and the elevator started again for the first floor. When the doors opened it appeared that he was correct and the alarm had not been raised. The lobby looked just as it did when he entered and as he walked out no one paid him any mind. He stood in front of his car and looked around watching the people passing him. They were all walking by unknowing of the act that had just taken place. He almost felt sorry for them.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hallway was dark and cold, the way the rest of the empty house stayed for most of the year. It contained no pictures or anything homely. The whole hose screamed of pain and loss. This place was a forgotten place just waiting to be discovered. It was a place fit for a rouge. Excluded from the world yet very much in touch with humanity. The furniture was very modern and spaced apart. The cheap feel was an expensive endeavor, now covered in white sheets. Not many people have seen this place, and not many people will ever see it. It&nbsp;contained a hidden room not even the builder knew of and could only be found by the owner. It was the only room that was used and had not been used for sometime. It opened to a set of steps that&nbsp;lead to a raised floor. When the lights where on it lit up so bright it would hurt our eyes till they grew accustomed to the room. This room contained forgotten tools used by a type of unknown man that most do not have the desire to become. The shelves made of a Fogged glass and cabinets of a dark wood had a layer of dust waiting to be disturbed. The low hum of cylindrical was the only sound to be heard. These lights specifically designed to be have a second purpose. This purpose was to keep the room out of ear shoot of any electronic listening devices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   There was a man in the corner of this room. He was alone lost in his thoughts. Still hurting from the night before when he was out earning his paycheck. He didn't lead a normal life or spend the wealth the he had earned. He had no plans and was only wondering through life one target at a time. In front of him sat a powerless computer. He waited for the specified time to turn it on and verify that the payment was made. He never really knew who it was that paid him only knowing it was the same person. His benefactor was an agent of sorts that dealt in death. He couldn't guess how many others there were like him only that there had to be others. There were many enemies in this world and many people with money to pay to get rid of those enemies. But now the time had come to power on the machine and verify his funds. He found what he had expected. Tuning the machine off he decided it was time to rest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The next day he sat down in front of the same computer in the same room and waited. Going through the same ritual that he went through day in and day out. And again it was time. As he logged on he had a new message waiting. Very rarely was there two messages for him 2 days in a row. It seemed though that his employer's faith in him was growing. He opened the message and read it. The message only contained a name and an attachment containing a photograph. This was all if not more information than he needed, but he knew it was just another precaution that had to be taken. There was something different about this person, though. Normally the targets where older and this one was younger. They all seemed to be of a certain class in society, but this person looked to be way below the normal standard. Who was he to judge his targets though, but then this wasn't judgment it was research. The beginning of his research. He knew in only a could hours he would know everything there was to know about this person. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The research on this one did not turn up as much as most of the others. There where only a few minor infractions against the young man in the police database. He owned nothing and had never bought anything on credit. He was however a very highly trained unit of the United States Army. He seemed a formidable foe. Though the picture that he had received did not portray this type of person. This picture portrayed someone closely resembling a drug addict. Of course this could be the case. A lot of these young boys sign up to become highly skilled war units for the glory. It is only when their skills and talents lead them into a combatant role in the real world does the true self surface. Many can not handle the after thoughts of what they have done and turn to anything that can help them escape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The man sat behind his computer starring at the picture coming to all the correct conclusions. He did not have to justify the killing of this target as some would, but this would become a mercy killing. No one should have to live with ghosts of a past lifetime. Most can't ever move on and eventually kill themselves one way or another. This target looked as though he was well on his way with the needle. That was the only thing that could make a person resemble a skeleton as this target did. It was time to pack for the journey ahead. The equipment would be transported in his car with him. He would drive to the destination and start his surveillance and intel gathering. He would be patient and wait for the right time to strike. Then with ungodly persuasion it would happen and then as if he was never their it would end. He knew then he would find himself back where he sat waiting to tune on the computer to verify payment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   After loading the car's trunk with only the necessary gear he entered the car and sat in the driver's seat. Sitting there he starred ahead at the glass, not looking past the clear surface. He held the keys in hand and was enjoying the dark silence. He looked into the mirrors making sure they were in the correct position knowing they would be. He slipped the seat belt over his chest and into the buckle. He methodically found the Key to the car and slowly slipped it into the ignition feeling each ridge slide past its rocker. The ignition turned the motor over and the car was started. He paused for a moment before opening the center console and pulling out his one and only pair of sunglasses. They were silver frames with mirror tinted lenses. With gloved hands he reached for the door opener and pushed the round button. The light slowly went from only a line of brightness to a flood, and with that he entered the world. This world was not his world, but only one he studied. He knew isocracies of the human race, but felt him self set apart. Not inferior or superior, just set apart. This was the sole reason he decided on this life, and it was the sole reason he was more and more wanting it to end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The road was comforting and rhythmic to his senses. It gave him time to observe the world as it passed. The young peering at him inquisitive through the back window and the old never moving their eyes off the road in front of them. The only stops that were made where for gas, and these stops where the times he would eat. Normally finding a dinner close to the highway where the people didn't pay him much mind. Only the waitress would talk to him and he could barely make it thought that much interaction. He preferred the stillness of nothing and longed for it most at times like these. This feeling was not something that controlled him, but something he indulged himself in when he could. No he had been in many crowds and could talk his way into anything needed or desired. He was a student of humanity always watching, studying, learning how to better accomplish a desired affect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   When he had arrived at his destination, an old hotel in a bad part of any city, he laid back on the bed with his luggage beside him. Listening to the tenants that most certainly spend most of their life here and the little muffled sounds they or the shows on the television made, he enjoyed the atmosphere. It was far from the cleanliness of his dwelling, but he could appreciate the mood it cast upon him. Letting his mind become the mind of a person that would reside in a place of this nature and enjoying the stillness of the air. He let his eyes close for the first time in a day and a half he felt nothing.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thick skinned and leather bound…Why not is the motto. I am tired of seeking advice from people who ask the same questions. I am from a generation of kids who are no one’s protégé. How about we accept the fact, and grow up. How about we start making our own rules? Why not give the illusion that I know what it is about and move on. These are the thoughts now what will they be when another tragedy happens. Can I stand fast? Well, I am starting with the addiction I am most convicted about and solving it. This is my start, what is yours? What will prove to you that you can succeed? As we grow these things get harder and this is what separates the kid in us from the adult. Were our parents taught this? We will never know, because we will not ask and they will not tell. The greatest generation looks&nbsp;on us as unguided with no purpose. Well, yeah!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents, drugs, work, the opposite sex, life are our topics that we speak around the bowl. How do we act? How do we have fun? Is there really another way? Regardless we move toward the end of the greatest, world wide empire that has ever existed. Math has been taken to a level that was never imagined by people even 10 years ago. Old news is the fact that I can talk face to face someone located twelve hours away. My car now gives me directions to the restaurant it made reservations for. Is this really needed?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This takes a lot out of us. Why aren’t I an accomplished millionaire at the age of twenty one? I guess one day maybe but that isn’t good enough. Our parents gave us what we wanted because it was easier, and now realize that they now have no retirement and wonder why. We are starting to realize that this is not how the world works no matter if we were brought up that way or not. Injustice is double sided. Where do we go from here?
