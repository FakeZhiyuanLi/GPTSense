						   You know what I miss?  Eating pussy.  How's that for an opening line.  Seriously, it's been a long time since I've gone down on a woman.  S doesn't care for it that much.  Don't ask me, I don't know. I really love going down on a woman.  I love everything about a woman's pussy.  I love the look, the taste, the smell.  I love having my nose buried deep while I try to push my tongue in as far as possible.  I love licking the inside of her thighs.  Feeling them against my cheek.  I love giving long slow strokes covering the whole length or short flicks on a hard clit.  I love finger fucking while I suck on that little knob. And when I'm feeling really hot, I'll tongue her tight rosebud, listening for the groan.   The best, absolute best, is feeling her cum on my tongue, hearing her vocalize, clutching my head. mmmmmmmmmmm.......... I love eating pussy.

						   I've been incredibly horny recently.  I go through phases where I am much hornier than others.  The ex and I haven't had much opportunity to do the deed recently, so praise be internet porn.  Not that I don't like porn any other day of the week.  I think my favorite types of porn are swingers and amateurs.  I prefer real people doing it than plastic porn stars.  Plus, it's nice to see a dick that's closer to my own size than the trunk of a tree.  Hey, I'm average, whatta ya gonna do? Anyways so besides enjoying the fun of internet porn,............... I know these posts aren't much, but I figure I'll build up to more.  I'd like to put in some past stories, sex, experiences, the like.

						   It seems all we do at work is talk about sex.  I'm not complaining.  I'm your regular horny guy who loves to talk about sex with women.  I enjoy getting their point of view.  I have three women in my immediate area.  One, a newly married woman, 28 with a baby.  Another a 40y.o. divorced, with a kid, the other 33 in the middle of a divorce, i mentioned her earlier.  the newly married one with a kid seems to be a bit of a freak. Either that or she just talks a good game.  The older one seems to have been a slut when she was younger, and probably still could be if she drank more.  The divorced one is a bit naive, and one of those romantic types.   We talk about all kinds of sex.  Everything from threesomes, to oral, to snow balling to salad tossing.  Needless to say, some days I go home quite horny. I'm horny most of the time anyways.  The ex and i don't do it much.  With the kids and all, it can be hard to fit in.  She can get freaky, but it's not much fun when you only have 20 minutes or so for sex.  She used to give the best blow jobs.  God they were incredible.  She'd love my cock with her tongue, stroking my balls, tickling my ass.  Sometimes it'd be that wonderful half hand job, half blow job, stroking me to cum in her mouth, or better yet on her lips.   Haven't seen one of those in a while. I love oral sex.  Giving and receiving.  I love burying my face in a pussy and sucking the hell out of her.  I love the smell, taste, and feel.  I love the way a clit feels against my tongue.  I love seeing how far i can get my tongue into her.  My favorite way of giving oral is to have her on all fours, sucking her pussy from behind.  I just feel like you can get to everything easier, and if she's into it, play with her ass, too. Getting oral, well, what can you say.  It's basic.  Tongue, plus cock, equals great.  Granted some women are much better than others, but bad oral is still pretty fucking good!

						   I think, overall, I enjoy my job.  It's not always terribly challenging, but it can be rewarding and I like the people I work with.  I work in a branch office for a huge corporation.  The local office only has around 10 people in it.  I'm sort of a jack of all trades in office.  I'm technically the pc coordinator, but i also do accounting, h.r., inventory and any other bullshit my v.p. can dream up. There is a girl in the office going through a divorce, or just starting one.  She claims he ignores her and doesn't pay any attention to her.  Frankly, she's a bit of a drama queen and is always in need of some attention.  Most likely he's sick of her and spends time away to ease his mind.  She is overall a sweet girl. She claims she knew it was over when about a week ago, he sat down next to her, started being really nice, holding hands, rubbing her neck. Obviously he wanted laid.  And she gave it up. But she claims that he didn't kiss her or be gentle or blah blah blah.......  Apparently he blew his load, then got up and went downstairs.  I guess if you are a needy type, this is bad. Hell, sometimes i really like the sex sessions where you just go at it like mad then just get up and move on.  That's pretty much the way sex is between S and I.  S is my ex wife that i live with.  We've always had a pretty good sex life.  Nasty and kinky at times, hot and fulfilling.  But we've never been the lay around and snuggle types.  Not even in the beginning.  I occasionally like to be romantic, take time, seduce a woman. That might be the thing I miss most being with S.  But for sheer get your rocks off, bend her over the counter and go to town sex, we have it going on. Anyways, the chick at work.  She told him last week she wanted a divorce.  He threw a fit.  I have never understood the crying, frantic male.  He apparently balled for hours, called everyone in her family, threw shit, etc. etc.  He sounds a bit unstable.  So come Sunday.  She had spent the weekend with her sister and when she sees him again, he is all calm and cool.  He's ok with the divorce, they'll get a dissolution, be adults.  Sounds a bit wrong to me.  I think he's trying to manipulate her, play on her emotions thinking she won't go through with it.  Chances are she won't.  She is a bit naive.  She's cute.  Her best asset is her rack.  It's stellar.  Big, bouncy.  She wears alot of low cut shirts with a lot of cleavage.  I think she knows how it works 'cause she bends over and drops them out in your face alot.  Doesn't bother me a bit.  It's been a while since i've see big ones up close.  S has little boobs.  My other ex had some nice mammaries.  Big, a little droopy, but nice.  Big hard nipples.  Very fun to play with.  Felt great wrapped around your dick.  If i can find the pic i have of her topless, I'll post it.  God I miss big tits.

						   Yes, another one.  There will be no rhyme or reason for this one.  Random thoughts, links, interesting pics, stories, whatever.   I'm just a 35 year old guy with little direction and sometimes even less motivation. Not the greatest start, but who is a blog really for, the reader, or the writer?
