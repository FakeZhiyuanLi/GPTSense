        Hey... here i am, blogging after quite a while.     Woke up at bout 11. Mom gave me the phone. It was my dentist. He asked me bout the Software. Damn, i had almost forgotten!! Kher, I made some excuse and told him that I'll work on the rest today. Then, I brushed and had some milk. Then, I sat at my pc. Chatted and posted at the forum. Then, I remembered that I had to burn some CDs. So, I located the songs. Converted them. Copied them to Dad's pc and burned the CDs. Then I listened to them and made the song lists. Then printed those lists. Neways, it was boring work.... and it took so long.  In the meantime, I also had lunch and watched the Pakistan vs Sri Lanka match for some time. I used to love cricket... but now, it seems as if i hate it!! I returned to my pc.... and finished those cds. Listened to a few songs. Chatted. Posted at the forum.   Then, I got Deejay's PM. She had gone for a week. And I ahd really missed her. I was happy that she was back. I replied to the message but it seemed that it didnt go. I tried almost a dozen times... but it timed out :@ . Then, I left for jogging. Hamza didnt come. I had done almost 2 rounds when I saw him on the track. He had come late, so i joined him. We took another round after that and then returned. Cooled down and went online. Chatted for a while. Forwarded some mails that had piled up in my inbox. Then, I checked Deejay's inbox. Emptied the junkox because all mails were bouncing!! Kher.... the junkbox was full of mails from the forum. And gues wat.... the msgs i had sent her.... all had gone!! :| It was like 12 msgs or sth. Kher... then i logged on to her forum account and deleted those extra msgs. Then, I continued chatting for a while and listened to songs.  After dinner, I went online again. Sana kept asking me bout the "Boys Forum"... hahahha. She begged me to let her in... but i couldnt :p. Kher... then Deejay came online. Man, were we happy to talk!! :D Her pc was not right so she was at somebody'd place. We talked. Then she went for some time and then came back. I was feeling sad already bcz now, i was going on saturday for a week :(. And, we couldnt even meet b4 that! :| Kher.... then she left bcz she had to go somewhere. I chatted for a while with Sana and Anum. I showed Sana the screendump of the forum.... she went crazy!! hahahahha. But, I couldnt let her in :p. Then, I had some mangoes.... and watched TV. Came back to my pc. Chatted some more. Haseeb Bhai came.... talked to him for a while. Then, I worked on the Software till late into the night.... bout 3. Then, I had a bath and went to sleep. Thats bout it!!    p.s. time is jinxed ;)

       This day, I will remember for the rest of my life. :D Here's how it went...  Woke up at 12. Brushed and had milk. Then, I went online. Checked mails. Went to the forum and posted. Then, at bout 1, I called Farazeh to wake her up. We were to meet at lunch today :D. Then, I went to dad and aplogized to him for not listening to him last night. And promised him that it was the last time. It took me sooo long to convince him... uff! Neways, then I went online for some time. Chatted and read news. I accidently saw the time... it was 2... damn!! I had forgotten!! I quickly disconnected... and went to take a bath. I dont even remember the last time i bathed so quickly :p. Neways, I changed and disconnected the net. Called Farazeh. She said that she had to tell her mom bout goin but she wasnt answering the phone. She told me to call again in a few minutes. Then, she said that her mom was still not answering the phone... and since it was already 3... we decided to go to KFC at 4. So, I went online. She also came on. We chatted for a while. Mamu came. So, dad told him to drop me instead. Bro was to go to defence too so he packed his stuff... well, the games and other boring stuff. Neways, I had said that ill be there at 4.... but got there at 4:25 :o. I had expected her to be there... but she wasnt :(. So, I called her. She said she was on the way... so I told mamu that my friends are coming and that he can go now! :p  Neways, I had to wait for almost 20 minutes b4 she came. In the mean time, I paid so that she wont get to do it... hehe :p. I began munching on some fries and had some coke to kill time. It didnt seem to move!! Finally, she came :D. It was the first time we were meeting so it did seem a little awkward at first... but then we settled in. We ordered the food and then just talked, talked and talked. I dont even remember bout wat... but we still just talked and talked. I really enjoyed it. She was just like I had expected :D. I ate 2 zingers and she was like... aur khana he?? hehehheh. Then, I msged dad from her cell to pick me up. When 5 min passed... she was like: "Abu andar to nai aa jaeyin ge??" Lol. I was scared too... hehe. So, after another 10 min, I told her to better go or i might get in trouble :p.  Then, I looked for a PCO to call dad bcz it was already 20 min since i called. I called him from somewhere and he still at home!! :@ I went back to KFC and waited for him. He came after another 25 minutes!! Then, mom wanted to get the new school books for adil so we went to the bookshop and got the books. Then, I got home. Went straight to the loo!! :p Then I changed and sat at my pc. Sana was online... she was like: tell me wat happened??!! hehehheh... so I told her the full story and she also told me something ;) I was soooo happy after that :D. Then, I started chatting. Time seemed to fly. Farazeh came and i chatted with her too. I chatted for almost 3 hours... my fingers literally began to ache!! Itni windows thien... everybody was so eager to get a reply!! :s Neways, I got off at bout 10:00... and watched TV. Infact, "Kyoun Ki Saas bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi" hehehhheh. Then, I discussed the trip we were planning with dad. We were plannig to go to Kalam, Malam Jabba and Nathiagali. Then, at bout I came online again. Surprisingly, few people were on :o. Neways, I posted at the forum for a while then got off again.  Then, I heated some pizza leftover from yesterday and ate it with apple cidra :D. I was really in a happy mood... and had made up my mind that i was gonna do it. But im still waiting. I guess today is not the day then. Neways, I just unblocked Murad and gave him a long lecture. Lagta he ab samajh gaya he... lol. Now, I remember that I promised that I'll go to sleep early today. Well, 2 isnt early, but still :p. Damn yaar... i dun wanna go.... but i still hve to!! :@  This is my day... i might hve missed some stuff... but the best part is there... and ill surely remember it for the rest of my life!! :D

       *yawn* here's how my day went today.  Woke up at 12. Had french toasts and milkshake. Then, sat at my pc for a few minutes. Dad was getting the store cleaned again so I had to go and help. But just b4 that, I sat on my pc and checked mails, etc. Then, I toiled in the heat for a couple of hours, occasionaly sneaking in and getting to my pc :p. I skipped lunch and continued helping dad. I need to please him ;) !! Neways, this continued till bout 4. I was stinking by then so i had a bath. Sat at my pc for some time. Posted at the forum and chatted. Called Hamza and told him not to come as i was tired and was in no mood to jog :p.  Then, mom called me and told me to help in the kitchen. She was making pizzas with my chachi for the feast. My cousin had gotten pretty godd marks in her 9th exams so there was kinda a celebration. I helped her for some time. Then, I came online again. Posted some more and chatted. Read news and stuff. Then, I went downstairs again to check on the pizzas bcz i was too damn hungry!! Still not ready... so i decided to read the newspaper for a change :p. It was the same old boring stuff. The only interesting thing was the article on Marlon Brando. Neways, finally the food came and i dug in. They were yummy and i dont remember how many pieces i ate... but i didnt get up b4 i was full :p.  I came back to my pc and decided to play underground but Adil came managed to get dad ti tell me to get off the pc. And, u know i cant say no to dad ;). So, I left my pc and looked for a DVD to watch. I found Freaky Friday. So, I put it on and hoped to get myself involved for the next couple of hours. It was a nice movie and the girl reminded of someone ;)... When the movie finished, I got back to my pc. But, just then dad's friend came over with his family. So, I had to go sit with them :s. They just left a couple of minutes back. And since then, ive been chatting, posting, and blogging. Now, im gonna start working on Farazeh's signature... partly bcz she just came online and is gonna ask me bout it!! :p  Lol... she just left and is gonna be back in 10 min... so I better start. Now, I'll be working on the sig till late and chatting with her and hanny. Till 2moro... ciao!

       Yestrday's blog ... bcz.... yet again... i was busy!  Woke up at bout 12. Had some milk. Dad told me to get ready bcz we had to go to the school to get the admission forms. I quickly changed and we left. The first thing i noticed bout Johar town was that the roads had been repaired. But, as we turned towards our school... the misconception was gone :s. I was going to school after bout 3 months. And all the khaddas were still there. Neways, I went in and bought the forms and prospectus. I had to pay for it. The school was being renovated and work was going on. I asked the guy some other details and then left. Next, we went to Lacas. I had seen the map in a newspaper and directed dad according to the directions i remembered. But, we couldnt find it :s. Then, I called Ahmed and asked him bout the way. He said that he ahd just some to our school and that we come over there. Then, we went back to LGS and he told us the way. So, we got to Lacas. They've got a nice, big campus. I went into their office and got the prospectus and forms. It was much better than ours... and they didnt charge any freakin money :o !! On the way back, I studied the stuff. But couldnt decide :s. Neways, we bought haleem on the way, went home, and had haleem for lunch. Then, I sat at my pc. Checked my mail. Chatted. Posted at the forum. Then, I went to the office for a while. Came back, chatted again. Changed and went for jogging. Came back. Chatted some more. Then, I had dinner. Chatted some... more :p. Explored Orkut. It is really an interesting thing. Mamu called and told that they were going to eat Falooda and that we should come along. So, we went to Ferozepur road and had falooda. It wasnt that good, but we still enjoyed it. Neways, then we got back. I changed and sat at the pc. Chatted for a while. Sana told me to make some changes to the sig. Then, she left. Hanan came. Chatted with him for a while. Farazeh came. Chatted with her. Meanwhile, I edited the sig. Adil was trying to convince dad to get him a new, seperate pc and dad even said yes!! This cant be!! :S Neways, since dad was in a good mood, I asked him for a mobile... and he said yes again!! :D Just like this.... time passed. I mailed Sana the sig. Dad kept telling me to get off the pc... but i kept lingerin on... but at bout 2:30... he got up and told me to close it... or no pc from 2moro!! :@ Damn yaar... I hate this!! :@ Neways, this is how the day went.

       Yesterday's blog again... daymn... i was too busy again! neways... here it is.  I was enjoying my sleep when Murad called. It was 12. I had told him to call me at 12 but i forgot myself :s. Neways, I had to get up. Took the call. Told him that the concert was fazool and all. Then, I remembered that I had to call someone. I picked up the phone. Itni baar try kiya. Par phone nai mila. Neways, mujhe yaad aaya keh aaj to Jumma he. So, I had a bath and ahd some milk. Then, I sat at my pc and checked my mails. Then, I chatted a little and left for Jumma.  After the prayer, I had lunch and have been online since. I chatted for some time with Hanan. And ive been posting at the forum and have been reading news at neowin meanwhile. I just called Ahsan and told him bout 2moro. Bichare ke parents ko us par shak ho gaya he... to the extent that, he cant even call his friends for more than 2 min!! :o Damn yaar!! Agar us ke parents ko us ke love affair ke baare mein pata chala... to woh to us ko ghar se nikal dein ge... ohho. Then, I chatted for some while. Mom got furious on seeing me at the pc again. She told me to go to dad at once and apologize. So, I did. Dad gave me long lecture. I promised to be good. And i meant it this time. I was so happy that he was talking to me again!! :D To please him, I did a few chores. He felt nice, I was hapy. Then, I went for jogging. Came back and went online again. Talked to Sana bout the sig. Got the pics. Then, I had dinner.  After dinner, I was working on the sig when all of a sudden, strange noises began coming from my hard disk. Then, after bout 2 min... BSOD!! :| Damn yaar... dunno wats wrong with my pc... i hve to chng hard disk every 3 months :s . Neways, i tried to reboot my pc. Didnt work. Kept giving the error: "Drive nor ready. System Halted." I was so scared!! I took out the hard disk. Took it to dad's pc. Attached it and prayed for it to work. Thank god it did! I backuped all important data on his pc including my huge songs collection. Then, I put it back in my pc. Didnt work again. Took out the RAM and display card. Cleaned the dust. Put it back in and voila!! I was so happy :D nothing was lost.  Neways, then I had some ice cream with mangoes. Chatted for a while. Then, worked on the signature late into the night. Meanwhile, the chatting continued. I stayed up till bout 3, but she didnt come. Neways, i just had some cookies and hit the sack.

Woh bhai to bohot hi aage pohonch gaye hein... hehehh. Then, I sat at my pc.... as soon as i logged in, a flood of msgs came. I began chatting... as always. Hassan online aaya. Played 2 games of pool with him. Score was level at 1-1 when he left. Neways, phir aik aur friend ke saath pool khela. But i had to teach her how to play first :p. Then, the office guy called and asked me if i had edited the page he had sent me. DAMN! I had completely forgotten it. Bari mushkil se Deeya ko manaya keh 10 min sabar kar le. Then, I made those changes and uploaded the page. Chatted some more. Then, I left and had lunch.  After lunch, mein office chala gaya. Showed them the page. Discussed another site. Then, they were sorting some CVs so i helped. At bout 4, I came back. I went to the forum and posted. Then, I went to Neowin and read news. Its nice to keep updated bout everything. Visited Spider's blog and read some more news. Then, I chatted some more. Ahsan came online. He forwarded me his mail to anum. My god. The love in their msgs. They had written poems for each other... hahahhah... kamal! Neways, esse hi time guzar gaya. Then, at bout 6. Farazeh came online. Chatted with her for a while. Hamza came. Went for jogging. Got back after 7. Sat at pc. Chatted with Farazeh. He told bout 2moro's concert. We thought of goin, but thought otherwise. Fazool hi tha. Hmmm.... then I had dinner. Came online and posted at the forum. Then, I watched TV and had mangoes. Phir, light chali gai so i had to go and sit outside. After some time, light aa gai. But bro begged me to give him the pc for some time. So, while he played, I lay down and relaxed. But 12 baje jab mein betha.... light light chali gai. Just one phase didnt go. Thank god, the pc was on that one.  I connected the cooler to that phase and sat at my pc. Farazeh was online as always :p. But shukar he aaj jaldi aa gai thi. I chatted with her. Then, she remembered that i had once promised to make a signature for her. So, I began making one. She sent me the pics. It took me bout 1 hour to make it. Meanwhile, Sana came online. I told her bout Gmail wagheira. Then, I told her bout the sig. She was chatting with Hanan and Farazeh. I told her to invite me. So, I joined their joint convo. Lol. Hanan really just types and types and types.... 4 baje tak chatting karte rhe...lol. Then, I left. Namaz parhi aur so gaya.

       I was to go to my nani's place today with my mom and bro.  Mom woke me up at bout 10 but i was sleepy that i didnt get outta bed. She told me to get up a couple of times but i didnt. Then, she pulled me outta bed and forced me into the bathroom :s. Neways, I had a bath. Drank some milk and sat on the pc. And wat do i see... msgs. I has set a comeback msg for Farazeh. She read it but didnt read that it said:  auto-responder ... heheheh. Like everyone else... she said... u there?? lol. Neways. After that, mamu came to pick us up. And so we went to Nani ghar.  When i got there, I watched TV for a while. Then, I got so sleepy that I almost fell off the sofa. My mom shook me and told me to have lunch first... hehheh. I quickly had lunch and then left to sleep. I went to my mamu's room and lay down on the floor. At once, I was asleep. At bout 5:30... i felt something jumping on me. As i openend my eyes... it was my mamu' daughter, Maira... lol. She was literally pulling my hair and saying: "Uthooaaaa!!" heheheh. Since i couldnt resist her, i had to get up. I washed my face and went out. Ahsan called just then. As i took the phone, he started yelling: "Kutte... tu ne kitna sona he... tujhe yaad nhin tu ne mere saath jana tha??!!" heheheh. I had forgotten that I had to go the tution with him. But, when i reminded him that he was to give me a treat after that, he started making excuses... as always. Saale ko mein ne galiyaan bhi dein... kehta he... "aakhir mein hoon to sheikh hi na"... hahahah. Neways, he said that he would call me after getting back bcz he had to give me some really good news. Then, I had milk and went to the barber's to get a haircut. I told him to just trim the hair. He cut off almost everything. End Result: My hair wont sit down now! :s . When I got back, pata challa keh paani hi band he :S. Then, I went and turned on the pc. Came online after repeated attempts to connect. Neways, went to the forum and posted. Chatted, as always :p. Since no one else was online, I went off. Then, I watched the movie "Girlfriend". Interesting... but i got bored after the middle part. Switched to friends then. Watched it till 9. Then, went and took a bath. Called Ahsan after that. He was busy doin somethin and said that he'll call back. But he didnt! :@ . Then, I read Newsweek. Abu came. We had dinner. Watched those Star Plus soaps :s. Had some mangoes. Then, we left.  I got back at bout 12. Changed. And since then ive been online. Chatting and now, blogging. Mom has been telling me to go to sleep... but im still lingering on :p. Neways, this sums up the day, ciao!

       I somehow knew that today was gonna be bad. And it was sooooo bad... damn!  I woke up at 2:30... nobosy woke me up b4 that. I could sense that something was not right. I was right :(. Dad was getting the store cleaned. Everybody else was helping. But he told everyone not to wake me up. He didnt even talk to me after that. It was as if i wasnt even there. Uff! I felt so guilty. Last night, he had told me to sleep, but i didnt. He was very naraz.  I had lunch. I offered to help in the cleaning thing, but he didnt even reply. My mother got furious and scolded me and told me to go and help. I helped for an hour or so. Then, I sat on the pc. But i didnt feel like doin nething. I was in a helpless state. I called Hamza at bout 6 and told him not to come bcz i was in no mood to go for jogging and hung up. It was rude, but i couldnt help it. Then, I sat on the pc again. Read SPIDER and visited some links. Chatted with Farazeh. Told her everything. She told me to go apologize, but i couldnt muster the courage. Neways, I had dinner. Then, I watched some TV. Bro ko idea aaya that gol gappay khate hein. So, we went to eat gol gappay. As we were leaving, Dad's friend called. He said that he was coming over. Dad told him to come to the gol gappa place. We went there. He also came. We had gol gappay. Got back. Then, I just lazed around. After some time, I decided to talk to dad. He didnt say much. Neways, leave that. Then, at 1 i came online. Since then, ive been posting, and chatting. Now, im off to bed bcz i gotta wake up early 2moro

Neways, i explained the rasta to his driver. Then, I sat on the pc for some time. Then, I bathed and changed. Had some milk. Then sat on pc again. Chatted a little. Called Ahsan. He told that he couldnt come bcz car nhin thi :s. Us ko do teen galiyaan dien... phir phone rakh diya. Raamish thori der mein aa gaya. Fasih didnt come... dumb ass. Hamza also came after some time. Then, I played table tennis with Raamish. Damn! I lost 5 consecutive games!! Then we had lunch. After that, we played some NFS. Phir, I beat Raamish twice... but lost twice again!! :(. I couldnt believe it myself. Then, we went for jogging and took Raamish along. He was sooo slow. We had to walk most of the way bcz he couldnt keep up. Neways, when we got back, his driver was here. He left. Hamza also left. I had sth to drink. Then, I sat online. Chatted a little with Ahsan. Then I had dinner. Watched some TV. Played NFS. Hamza came online. And so did that Nabeela.

       the day started in the same old boring way... woke up late... had breakfast.... sat online.... worked on site... then went for jumma.... had lunch and sat online again... but then a nice, funny thing happened.  Ahsan called. He was sounding as if he had just won some lottery or something... or as if he was on 7th heaven. I referred to his chakar with anum in a previous post. Well, he had just chatted with her. And she had told him, that she liked him... infact, really liked him. And, Ahsan had been feeling the same way so he told her the same too. Wow! He was so happy that i cant tell u. He told me the full story in 45 min on the phone. I was happy for him. He got wat he so much wanted. Lucky Guy!  Neways, apart from the story, I made 2moro's plan with him. He and a few other friends are comin over. After the call, I called Raamish, but he was sleeping. Then, I called Fasih, and told him to come. There was still time b4 jogging, so i came back online. Made a few posts. Chatted. Just then, my mamu came. I had to show him something on the pc. While i was doin that, Deeya came online. She messaged me. I said i was busy. But, i guess i did it in a rude way. So, she got naraaz. I didnt notice at that time. Neways, after my mamu left, Hamza came and we went for jogging. When i came back, she was again online. But she was very angry with me. After much difficulty, i was able to get her mood right. I said sorry but she wont listen. She was really pissed. Neways, then i went to the forum and posted some more. Had dinner and watched TV.  Then, I came online. Hassan was also online. So, I decided to add the buttons we had talked bout to the forum. I added them. Then edited them to change their color. After that, I chatted a little. Just then, I remembered that I had to make the changes to the software. So, since then, ive been doing that. Meanwhile, ive also been chatting :p and waiting for someone.

       Today was another of those boring days. Got up bout 12. Dad was sitting at my pc. Just then, the cable guy called. He told that the cable connection was blocked bcz the dues had not been given. Dad was furious. He said that damn ur cable, i dont want it, come and take away ur stuff and get lost! The cable was still bot working at that time... as always.  Neways, I worked on the site for some time. Had Lunch. Worked some more. Then i got a dialup account and came online. But, MSN refused to sign in. After repeated attempts, I decided to let it go. Then, I listened to some songs, posted at the forum, and just sat bored. At bout 6 i went for jogging. When i got back after an hour, i was flushed. After cooling down, I had some snacks and sat at my pc. Tried to get the cable to work, but couldnt. Then, I had dinner and watched the Ladies Semifinal between Williams and Mauresmo. It was a great match! Neways, then I came back online, chatted for some time and again posted at the forum. Had some ice cream. Then, Ahsan called. I had sent him that chat thing yesterday. He was laughing so hard. Lol. He was also shocked on reading it. Neways, now here I am, posting.  Today I looked at some other blogs and how they had customized their pages. So, i decided to use some of my HTML and CSS knowledge and give it a try myself. Now, im planning to edit the template of this blog and get some custom links in. They'll be done by night. I'll meet u in tommorow's edtion of my blog. Till then, Buhbye!

       hmm.... i just remembered today that i had planned to blog... but ever since my exams finished.... i completely forgot bout it. neways, now i seriously plan to blog regulary, starting from today! :D  Today, I had planned to wake up late. But, the office guy called and woke me up :( . Neways, i got up, changed and sat at my pc. Miraculously, the internet was on. I quickly downloaded my scanner's drivers and began scanning some cards. Then, i went to the office and gave the pics to the office guy. He told me bout the status of the website we are working on. Then, he briefed me bout wat i had to do next. I came back, sat at my pc, and found out that as always, the internet cable wasnt working :@ . I called up the cable guy. He told the same story that he tells me everytime that some hubs arent working properly, so the technician is fixing them.   Then, i scanned some more cards to kill time. After bout an hour, the cable guy came. I had to go out and carry the ladder to the pole. It was sooo hot :@!! Neways, while he was gone, I returned to my pc and worked on the website. After bout an hour, he returned. He claimed that he had fixed the problem. However, the damn net was still not on :@!! I told him to check again. He then came back after another 30 min  but he couldnt get the net to work. But still, he gave me the complaint form and expected me to fill it! I just gave it back to him and told him to come to me when the net is on :@  At bout 3, the cable was working. I chatted with some friends. Then, Ahsan called and confirmed our plan of goin to KFC in the evening. I invited a few other friends to tag along too, but no one was willing to commit on such short notice. If only Ahsan had confirmed the plan earlier... Neways, I chatted till bout 5. Then, I changed and a guy from the office dropped me of at KFC. I was expecting Raamish to be there, but he wasnt! I had to wait for but 20 min b4 he came. Although Ahsan was still not there, we decide to dig in bcz we were damn hungry. Afterall, we hadnt had somethin since morning!! Ahsan came after another 20 min. To kill time, I decided to ask Raamish bout Ahsan's friend Anum. I didnt know that he knew nothing bout her... lol. Since he knew nothing, I decided to tell him something. Well, when Ahsan came, Raamish immediately barking out wat i had told him. Silly guy. Neways, that started the shugal we all wanted. I teased Ahsan bout Anum. He has literally blushing!! Then, a crazy thing happened. I go to Lawrewnce Garden every evening for jogging. And a friend, Hamza, goes with me. lol. What happened is that, I Ahsan told me not to invite Hamza. But i forgot to tell him that I was goin and I wont be home. At bout 6, he came to my house. My mom told him that I was at KFC. lol. He came straight to KFC. Hahahahahah!!! That was a sight!! He was infuriated. It had completely slipped my mind. Neways, after cooling him down, he began eating with us. Only 30 min were left in the all-you-can-eat deal, so he quickly dug in. Then, the fun started. Hamza already knew bout the Ahsan-Anum chakar. Raamish didnt. The two of us teased Ahsan so much that he was literally begging us to stop! Hahahahah... we had so much fun!! By 7, we were so full with chicken, that we were couldnt even get up from our seats!!  After KFC, I came back home with Hamza. We listened to some songs. While I was chatting with a friend, Ahsan came online. He was very angry with me. He was cursing me for telling Raamish bout his chakar. Lol. I managed to cool him down. Then, Hamza left. I went to the forum, posted a little, and now, since the past 30 min, ive been writing my first serious blogging post ever!:D  Now, im calling Ahsan, to tease him a little more. Then, i'll have a bath. Watch some TV. Then play some Underground. Hopefully, I'll try to incorporate the changes the client told me to do in the Clinic Managment Software I made and then ill probably sit online and chat till late.  That sums up my day, and ive finally made my first blogging post!! :D
