      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Let's see...last weekend I went on a road trip to Benicia, which is just outside of San Francisco, to visit my friend Scott with Michele and her friend Mary. Scott, aka Skippy aka Biscottie, or as we like to call him, Scottie, recently moved up north to attend medical school at Toro? Hmmm something like that. I'm not too familiar with it. Michele and I decided it would be a good idea to go visit him before school starts for both him and her. As we all know, I am no longer in school and still have no job. Obviously my schedule was WIDE OPEN.  &nbsp;&nbsp; We left on Friday around 2:30pm after making a couple of quick stops to a few of my favorites and maybe some of yours....The Coffee Bean and In 'N Out. A road trip just isn't a road trip without first stopping at these two delicious places. Now the ride up was not so bad until we hit Berkeley. Mary was going to stay with her friend Matt at his fraternity house the first night so we needed to drop her off before heading to Scott's&nbsp;which was&nbsp;fortunately only about 20min or so away. We exit into the area and are trying to follow the directions that Matt gave us, but the only problem is...Berkeley...doesn't...have...street signs!! Well at least not where you can see them clearly. And of course every other street or so is a One Way...so let's just say after driving for more than 6hrs up north Michele was not a happy camper...well actually driver. Camper. Driver. Tomato.  Tomato . Whatever. And I have to admit it was very frustrating. Because we couldn't find any street signs we just kept driving until we ended up in the ghetto. Scary! Finally we turned around and somehow by luck, found the house.&nbsp;Michele continued to&nbsp;shout F*** Berkeley! F*** Nor Cal! until we actually left the Berkeley area.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Our original mission, which we chose to accept, was to drop Mary off, get to Scott's, eat dinner, get ready to go out to the city and meet up with Mary and Matt there. Our mission was reluctantly aborted when we realized we had reached Scott's after&nbsp;ten and still had not eaten dinner.&nbsp;Fortunately Scott&nbsp;was nice enough to have&nbsp;purchased us&nbsp;each a salad (dinner of champions)&nbsp;which was ready and waiting for us when we got there. Seriously we were starving and very grateful. By the time we finished eating we decided&nbsp;to throw in the towel and&nbsp;try&nbsp;to go out the following night. Since opting for a quiet night in instead of a wild night out we decided to make it a blockbuster night.....well technically a Hollywood Video night and rented an actual&nbsp;video. Literally folks, we rented a  V I D E O T A P E . The&nbsp;store ran out of the movie we wanted to watch on DVD so we opted for the video. It was&nbsp;like watching a movie in the Stone Ages. Scottie couldn't figure out how to even take it out of the box. All&nbsp;of a sudden I was Betty hanging out with Fred and Wilma Flinstone. Where was&nbsp;Barney you ask? Lord only knows...but anyway we watched the film  The Big Bounce&nbsp; starring Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman&nbsp;and Charlie Sheen. Let's just say I wouldn't put it on my  must see  list. Michele fell asleep and I think Scott and I were just waiting for it to be over. Once it was, Scott was itchin for the special features link. Of course we were SOL on that one.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my goodness! I forgot one very important piece of information! I never mentioned the vibrating couch! Scottie has a vibrating couch! This thing is very cool...the left and right seats of the couch recline AAALLLLL the way back. And if you pull down the middle back cushion it reveals the controls to vibrating the back and seats. Believe me it is very VERY cool. Scott was such a gentleman too.&nbsp;He&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;say a word when&nbsp;Michele and I confiscated his bed while he slept on the couch. Unintentionally, I think we made it worth it when Scott walked into his bedroom and found me wiping lotion on Michele's back as she's sitting on his bed wearing nothing but a thong. Really it wasn't that exciting, it just looked really bad. And of course he grabbed her camera and took a picture of it. Guess there will be a little surprise for that film developer.  &nbsp;&nbsp; The next day Scottie took us into the city so that Michele and I could go shopping. Mary was with Matt doing the touristy stuff like seeing art museums and the wharf. Where as Michele and I have been to SF so many times before that shopping was in our favor. We walk into&nbsp;Macy's, which is HUGE by the way, and&nbsp;couldn't even decide where to start. The mall concierge, actually a little old man in uniform, asked us if we needed help finding anything and Michele asked him for women's shoes.&nbsp;He informed us to go up the escalator, through the clothes towards the back and we'll end up in shoe heaven. Then he turns toward Scott and says, "My condolences to you sir, it's going to be a very long day for you." We laughed and headed straight for shoe heaven. The old man&nbsp;could not have  been  any closer to the truth. The place was HUGE! Shoes everywhere! I was like&nbsp;a drug addict and&nbsp;shoes were my heroine.&nbsp;All I needed to do was take that first hit and everything would be aaalllll riiiiight....but alas&nbsp;I could find no shoes to fit my tiny feet. Michele made out like a bandit though.&nbsp;She bought a pair of converse and pumas for $47 total! Biotch!&nbsp;Later we ended up&nbsp;in American Eagle Outfitters and spent way too much. Especially way too much for people who have no jobs. Aren't credit cards the American way?&nbsp;Hmmm maybe not...my mistake.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Matt and Mary found us back in Macy's in the purses and handbag department while waiting&nbsp;for our table in the Cheesecake Factory. Dinner took about 4hrs to complete due to waiting to get a table then just to even get our food.&nbsp;By the time we&nbsp;left the city it was&nbsp;after 9pm. We waved the white flag and surrendered to the fact that we were not going to make it out to the city at night.&nbsp;It turned out to be a wise decision because man were we broke!&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp; The next day&nbsp;the three&nbsp;of us headed out around 12:30pm after eating a quick snack with Scott at Burger King. We wanted to hang on to our appetites since we were planning on hittin up the Gilroy Garlic Festival. The GGF&nbsp;was so much fun! We&nbsp;sampled garlic jelly beans, garlic fries, garlic stuffed olives, garlic pasta, garlic mushrooms, garlic calamari and&nbsp;roasted corn on the&nbsp;cob slathered in garlic butter. We were in garlic heaven.&nbsp;We were all a little scared of the car ride home since we still had about 4hrs to go. It turned out to be not that bad...though we may have just been used to the smell by then.&nbsp;The only thing that sucked was that we were not prepared for the heat that we endured. I was sweating like a little garlic pig in a denim blanket. Fortunately they were giving away free water at the H2O Aquafina booth.    &nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of the ride home was pretty uneventful. Well except for a few things. On the road we ran into two different guys who think that drive by flirting on the freeway&nbsp;is a&nbsp;dying&nbsp;art. One guy kept is speed right next to our car for like 10min until he got our attention. He waved. I waved back. He pointed at his wedding finger motioning me to show him if I was married or not. I shook my head no. He blew a kiss&nbsp;and then&nbsp;Michele proceeded to fake picking her nose and show him what she found to get him off our backs. It's quite a useful tactic. Disgusting....but it gets the job done. Later we saw another man following us for a while.&nbsp;He waved as well and did the whole blow a kiss deal too.&nbsp;Is that standard for car flirting? I'm going to have to go back and read my manual I guess. Once he reached riding next to us consistently he rolled down the window and gave us the "follow me" motion with one finger which soon turned into the whole hand motion to follow him. I mean seriously who does that?!&nbsp;Then he would turn his right blinker on and off to let us know he was exiting and that we should follow him. Does this man think that we are desperate enough&nbsp;or just that stupid that we would follow&nbsp;a stranger off the freeway and meet up with him?! Who are these people?&nbsp;Does this particular tactic actually work for them? As if! After we maneuvered our way through Santa Barbara traffic we were in the home stretch.    &nbsp;&nbsp; And that my friends was my weekend road trip to San Francisco.&nbsp;Hope you enjoyed that story. This weekend my family and I are going to the Orange County Fair. Who knows what will happen next....stay tuned....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp; I know I know I haven't written on here in a while but PEOPLE! I have a life ya know. I&nbsp;do get&nbsp;busy. I have things going on....friends to see...birthdays to celebrate...jobs to apply for...guys to date...(Did I just say that?)well not really. I'm just lazy. But still, I promise I will get around to updating you all on this soap opera called, My Life!, but not tonight. I don't have the strength or energy to jump into that mess right now. SO...I thought I would throw you a bone and share this little&nbsp;article that my dad tossed into my lap tonight. It's about Love vs. Infatuation. Do you know the difference? I found it very interesting and I thought many of you would too. Especially my female readers. Now let me just clarify. I did not write this nor do I know who did or where this article came from, as in a newspaper or magazine. So please don't give me any credit. Here it goes....    LOVE or INFATUATION?   &nbsp;&nbsp;  Infatuation is fleeting desire -- one set of glands calling to another. It is marked by a feeling of insecurity. You are excited and eager but not genuinely happy. There are nagging doubts, unanswered questions, little bits and pieces about the relationship that you would just as soon not examine too closely. It might spoil the dream.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Love is friendship that has caught fire. It takes root and grows, one day at a time. It is quiet understanding and mature acceptance of imperfection. It gives you strength and grows beyond you to bolster your beloved. You are warmed by his presence, even when he is away. Miles do not separate you. But near or far, you know he is yours and you can wait.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Infatuation says, "We must get married right away. I can't risk losing him." Love says, "Be patient. Don't panic. Plan your future with confidence."    &nbsp;&nbsp; Infatuation has an element of sexual excitement. Whenever you are together, you hope it will end in intimacy. Love is not based on sex. It is the maturation of friendship that makes sex so much sweeter. You must be friends before you can be lovers.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Infatuation lacks confidence. When he's away, you wonder if he's being unfaithful. Sometimes, you check.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Love means trust. You are calm, secure and unthreatened. He feels your trust, and it makes him even more trustworthy. Infatuation might&nbsp;lead you to do things you will regret but love never steers you in the wrong direction.    &nbsp;&nbsp; Love is elevating. It lifts you up. It makes you look up. It makes you better than you were before.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  So what did you think? I thought it was very insightful. A very well thought out article&nbsp;defining the differences between Love and Infatuation. I know I can relate to many of the statements made.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok well&nbsp;it's getting late and I'm pretty tired so that's going to have to be it&nbsp;for now...more when we return....&nbsp;

      Let us recap where I left off last because Lord knows it's been forever since I've written on here. We're going to run through this quickly because I have too many things to discuss. Then we'll dive back into the more interesting drama another time.  Ok the last thing I mentioned was my date with J. correct? Well the date went absolutely fabulously! At least that's what I think. Men and women have different perceptions of how a date went, don't they? J. picked me up at 7pm and off we went to have sushi at our favorite Japanese restaurant. Many of you already know which place I'm talking about, the rest of you may not, but probably don't care either. We had a few drinks along with some great conversation, delicious hand rolls and then...he drops the bomb. Not literally though.&nbsp;I find out that J. broke up with his gf of 3yrs (off and on) the day before to I guess, explore other options? Meaning what? I'm not so sure.&nbsp;I know what you're thinking. Where's the beef?! What's the big deal? Believe me, there is more to this meatless story and&nbsp;this&nbsp;news is&nbsp;huge, but way too messy to get into at the moment, so let's just put that on the back burner and let it simmer a while. Afterwards we went to TGIFriday's for some more drinks. It was great! We get along so well together...I guess&nbsp;we always have. Why is it that you never realize how&nbsp;awesome someone is right in front of your face until it may be too late and then they're gone? Man life sucks like that. Is that what they mean by "Love is blind?" Well after we had our little buzz going we headed back to my place to watch a little tv. Now I'm not one to kiss and tell, well at least not in writing so we'll just let your imaginations run wild with this one. Don't be too dirty now...I'm a good girl... =) But let's just say the night ended very very well...well as well as it could be considering I&nbsp;am living&nbsp;at home with my&nbsp;family.&nbsp;So as for J. and I, that is all there is to tell. Nothing more nothing less. Just one awesome night.  Friday night I went to Moose McGillucuddys (I have no idea how to spell that sorry) in Old Town Pasadena with a bunch of girls. It turned out to be a ladies night, which was nice because I haven't done that in a while. Michele was invited by her friend Mary and apparently it snowballed into many other little chickies. J. was supposed to come with one of his friends, but bailed out at the last minute. Figures. Apparently he was drinking all day with a buddy in SB (Santa Barbara). The night turned out to be all right though we were off to a rocky start. Now understand we're coming from Chatsworth, which turned out to be a good 30 - 40min drive&nbsp;to Old Town Pasadena. And once we had literally just dropped the car off at the valet, Michele realizes she forgot her I.D. Long story short, her lovely bf drives all the way out there to drop it off. What a nice guy! All I know is that boy is gettin some major lovin for the next couple of weeks. Anyway the night went on...I drank a little....the girls met some guys. (Actually cute guys&nbsp;and possibly promising) I drank a little more....the girls went dancing. I drank a little more...the girls were still with those guys. By the end of the night I was buzzed and talking to some supposedly 22-year-old guy from Riverside. I know. I was the envy of all the ladies that night. I swear going to clubs/bars is just not as fun as it used to be. I found myself surrounded by a bunch of 22 or 23-year-old girls who would normally be mistaken for models if it wasn't for the fact that they were all between the height of 5'1" and 5'3". Basically I had just come to the realization that I was the Old Maid of the group. 25 going on 55. Could I BE anymore pathetic? Finally the night ended and I was able to crawl into my comfy "girl boxers" and tank top (Come on we're in the valley it's freakin 80 some degrees at night here, if it wasn't for the fact that I was sharing a bed with another girl I'd be naked) and attempt to go to sleep. Apparently the several Malibu and cokes I consumed were not sitting in my malnutritioned stomach. Has anybody ever told you it's not wise to drink on an empty stomach? Well they're right.  The next day I tried to sleep it off after racing home in time to&nbsp;be in attendance for my mom's spontaneously planned Saturday morning brunch. Now I know that sounds like an oxymoron, "spontaneously planned," but what I mean is that my mom planned to make this brunch for us the last couple of days, but has never made brunch for us like this before in my life. Saturday night I made an appearance at Chad's party. Janelle, Corrine and Katy all had other plans and weren't able to make it so the night just wasn't the same without them there. I said my hellos and small talk...and then my goodbyes. At about 10pm I headed over to Michele's bf Steve's parents house. He was having a party too. I actually had a lot of fun there. Mary came over and J. was there too with his friend. We all talked and reminisced about old times. My brother even came and got in on that action. I could tell he was having a good time, not to mention he was drinking and I was driving. What's wrong with this picture? I'm 25 and of legal drinking age. My brother is 19 and 2 yrs from being legal, yet I was the DD? Hmmm I think I got worked.  Sunday my family and I went to Pasadena to visit with my great aunt. We had lunch and hung out for a few hours before heading home. On the way&nbsp;home I&nbsp;noticed that the car's thermometer reached 106 degrees when driving through the valley! That's sick! Fortunately in my town it was in the mid to high 80s with a nice breeze. Why am I giving you the weather report??? I must be tired. To finish off my weekend I ended up having a drink with&nbsp;my old friend Jon&nbsp;from college. That was cool, I hadn't seen him in a couple of years. It's always nice to play catch up. The bartender chick thought it was a first date. Um no!&nbsp;But that was pretty much it. Next weekend I'm supposed to go to San Francisco or at least somewhere just outside it to visit Scottie with Michele and apparently now Mary. I hope it's fun...it should be fun....we'll see....you know you'll hear about it sooner or later.

      Ok people you may be wondering what sort of new and exciting things have gone on in the last 24 hours, well let me give it to ya straight. Not a whole lot...BUT! And it is a big but, I may have a possible job lead. Wahoo! Finally a break in these gloomy unemployment clouds. Are you interested? Well even if you're not, here's the scoop. Yesterday after dinner my friend called, we'll call him R. and asked if I wanted to go get a drink. Me being the complete party animal that I am of course replied, sure! (Please note the sarcasm in that last sentence, if you actually knew me you'd understand) R. picked me up at 8:30pm and we cruised over to BJ's Brewery. After a few drinks and some lively conversation, we began to discuss my job hunting situation. R. sympathized with me because he too was in my shoes just a few months ago. Fortunately he found a job with a small company doing graphic design. Today I get a call from him saying that there may be a position for me with this other company, (apparently they market these new popular shoes that are all the rave with celebrities or something). He said, here's the contact number, call them and check it out. Now he may not have given me a load of detailed information but it's a start right? So now my next mission? To polish up my resume, (I swear I've revised it and revised it and revised it), and psyche myself up enough to call and see what's available. That is my little nugget of news today. Cool huh? As far as "What else did I accomplish today?" Well...my cousin Jennifer called this morning and asked if I wanted to go walking today. Walking. Me. Me and walking. Now there's a concept. Now I know a lot of people walk for exercise and even for fun! But I thought to myself, do I really want to interrupt my lovely day of vegging on the couch watching daytime television and snacking to go walking? Sure, why not.  So I got all decked out in my workout gear, which consisted of navy blue Nike gym shorts, a white sports bra and white tank top and Nike running shoes. I looked like the poster child for Nike. But hey if you're gonna "just do it," do it while looking good, right? Then I met her at noon and we walked...and we walked...and we walked. And at about 12:30, we were done. So to congratulate ourselves on a walk well done we decided to go lay out by her pool. I know it's a hard life, but somebody's gotta do it. Surprisingly it was empty. Apparently everyday that Jennifer has gone to the pool, it's been filled with children and their mothers. Come to find out, the pool was closed, technically. As we're leaving we notice a sign posted on the gate entry, "Pool Closed Today Due to Repairs." Hmmm so that is why those workers kept staring at us when they kept walking by. They were probably thinking "Stupids girls, can't they read the sign?" Ah well...they never told us to leave.  And there you have it...day 2 of the exciting world of Jenny. Tomorrow night I have a date with, one of my really good guy friends, we'll call him J. Here is where it gets pretty interesting. But if you want to know the drama you'll have to wait until next time. It's way passed my bedtime.

         Blog. A word learned in school in one of my many Journalism classes at California State University of Northridge. A word, and its meaning, currently forgotten almost 2 years post graduation. That is until now...     About a week ago or so one of my best friend's, Janelle, AKA Nelly, started her own blog. Then I saw another one of my best friend's, Katy, AKA "Katy M.....r you're all American!," post a comment in response to Janelle's blog. It got me thinking...what a great idea! What a great way for all of my best friends and I to stay updated with one another while also expressing any thoughts or concerns of our own. And anybody who knows me, knows that I am always ALWAYS thinking. Did I mention that I am a very visual person? For those of you who don't know me or at least don't know me well, let me give you the short and sweet version.    My name is Jenny Mo.... well lets leave it at Jenny. I am newly single and living in Southern California, where weatherwise is about the best place there is to live! Cost of living? just about the worst. I just moved back to my hometown from San Antonio, Texas and am currently living with my parents and one 19 year-old brother. My current mission? To find a new job ASAP! Then save some money and get back out on my own. As far as Texas goes, you're probably wondering why I was living there when I was already living in beautiful Southern California? Let's just save that story for next time...    My circle of friends consist of 5 very important women, and 4 very special men.    Kristy is like the sister I never had, but in reality is actually my cousin. Corrine, Janelle and Katy are friends who I have known since either 7th, 8th or 9th grade and are and always will be my CBD sisters! The most recent girlfriend of mine is Michele, who I became close to within the last 5 years. And though she always "gives it to me straight" whether I want to hear it or not, I know she has my best interests at heart. Chad, Eric, Jess and Jeff are guys who I have known since the 7th grade in the good old Monte Vista days. They have always been there for me and I know I can always count on them. Because of these people and many others not mentioned who have touched me life, I am truly blessed.    And there it is folks, my life as we know it in a nutshell. Pretty exciting stuff huh? Don't worry it'll get better...man I hope it gets better!

       Some families camp out in Yosemite National Park. Some families roadtrip it to see the Grand Canyon. Other families may even spend their weekends at the beach playing volleyball or burying one another in the sand. However, Saturday my family went to the Orange County Fair. Now don't get me wrong. I'm just teasing...my parents have taken my brother and I to many very cool places. We've been around Europe, the east and west sides of the Caribbean, two islands of Hawaii, Orlando, Florida etc etc I could go on and on. It's just that as we get older my family goes on far less "family vacations" together. And I guess a part of me misses that. So...as our "family togetherness" this year we went to the Orange County Fair and are also going to San Diego for Labor Day weekend. I guess we're going to Sea World and some Wild Animal Park. I don't know...it sounds like fun! I haven't been to Sea World since I was very young and as for the Wild Animal Park? Never. So it should be good times. Originally we were all supposed to go Lake Tahoe in August, which is what we used to do every other year, but we're hoping I'll have a job by then and my brother should be back in school as well. So it's turning out that my brother and I will have a parent-free week in August instead. I THINK I can handle that. Ok back to the fair. Well we left around nine in the morning to avoid traffic seeing as how it is over an hour away. I think we made it before 11am so it wasn't too crowded at that point and we didn't have to park that far, which was nice. In fact the whole day we had pretty nice weather. It wasn't so hot that I was roasting like a pig, but it was warm enough that I could literally feel my skin turning brown by the minute. Tan lines are not pretty no matter what any guy says. They just like them because it reminds them of the chicks in porn movies. Apparently that's a flattering look in porno world...anyway...once we walked through the gate we treated the fair like any normal soiree. When entering a social event that involves a crowd and entertainment you must always do the "once around" before committing to a location. I believe I got that tip from Cher in  Clueless . So we walked...and we walked...and we walked...passed the game booths, passed the food stands, passed the petting zoos and passed the random mini stages where local unknown bands played. And what do you think the first thing my family wanted to do??? If you know my family at all, I'm sure you guessed right. We ate. Actually they ate, I watched and waited. And what was the first thing they tried out? Fried chicken and garlic fries. Nothing but health food for this fit family. After that we decided to check out the exhibits. That was fun....for my mom and I at least. Basically it was shopping and the poor guys just had to go along with it. I purchased tiny (obviously faux) diamond earrings for $5. I've wanted to replace the silver balls I've had as my second piercings forever with diamond studs. I also bought some dangly chandelier-like earrings that are silver and pink, also $5. Very fun I must tell you. And last but not least the best purchase of the day...my Hawaiian tote bag. Only $1.99!!! It's so cute too! It's cheap but doesn't come off totally cheap looking ya know what I mean? Later I went back to buy more but they were all out of the cute pattern. The rest were kinda eh. Sorry guys otherwise I would have gotten one for each of my CBD girls. Then it was time to sit and have something else to nibble on. My dad and I got some ice-blended coffee drinks (not nearly as good as Coffee Bean but what can you do?) my mom had an iced raspberry tea thing, which turned out to be a bit tart so she didn't like it and my brother had an iced mango tea thing, which was really good and a cheesecake on a stick, not bad. All drinks had whip cream of course. Once we refueled we were ready for round two and headed for the games. My brother played several, some he lost some he won. I played a few and won once. My dad played a couple and won once. My mom on the other hand played one game....and lost. BUT she got a prize just for playing so she didn't leave empty handed, but neither did anyone else who played that game too. In the end our prize list consisted of a large picture and frame of Al Pacino in Scarface (why?), a somewhat medium/large mad looking red dog, a large Nemo-looking yellow fish, a smaller yellow duck wearing sunglasses and 2 red, 1 pink and 1 yellow velvety stuffed roses. I'd say we did all right. As the sun was getting ready to set and our feet were getting more swollen by the minute our stomachs began telling us that it was just about dinner time. The next thing I knew....we were on our way to Irvine Spectrum. For those of you who aren't familiar with Irvine Spectrum, its a large open mall-like area filled with department stores, shops, restaurants, bars etc. It's quite a hang out for the younger generation. Some of us even have memories of going to Irvine Spectrum right Janelle? (wink wink) We walked around a bit there before deciding on sushi as our dinner. We went to Maki Maki, which turned out to be really yummy yummy. And of course it being "My Family" we ordered too much. But it WAS worth it. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Once we ate til we were busting at the seams we wrapped up our leftovers and headed for home. Unfortunately for my dad, he had to drive while the rest of us got to pass out from our food coma and our all around exhausting day at the fair. I believe it was about 9:15pm when we walked through the door. I had planned on possibly going out with some friends that night, but once my butt hit the couch I honestly could not move. So people....that was my family day outing at the Orange County Fair. Was it as good for you as it was for me?
