      Alright this is my first time having one of these.  Let me start off by introducing myself.  My name is Stefanie I life in New Jersey and I live in  a hicks town.  I got a highschool in the middle of nowheres so don't even bother trying to find me.  I Love playing sports especially softball, soccer, and volleyball. My favorite college team is Princeton..I usually watch college sports...yea I'm cool like that.  I have the coolest friends ever!!  I have a wonderful boyfriend too.  And he accepts me for me.  I have a crazy mind.  And I'm the most randomest person you'll find.  I'm just full of ideas and imagination.  However, I do have my downfalls, I am very spoiled, and a brat.  I can be very obnoxious, and I crave for center of attention. ...Lets get down to business..my day today..we had a hypnotist come to our school and a few of my friends were involved with it and I couldn't stop laughing.  I almost peed my pants.  thats my new goal..oh yes..I must add..I have three goals in life Go to Italy Take a trip through all of Europe Get hypnotized  well thats all for now..  ~Stefanie
