      One last thing. I am not allowed to use a Peter Pan email. So I have to think of a new one. Here are my other ideas: Twinkling_Pink_Faerie_72 And others I can't remember right now. Lol. Tootles. ~Ana~

      These past three days have been fantastic!! Wow! The girls had dorms right across from the guys, and it was really fun to wave at them from across the path thingie. Lol. And I met people I had previously known, Like Matt James who was in Mr. McKenna's class with me years ago! Things like that. Or I made new friends and acquaintances with people like Tess, Claire, Catrina, Melissa, Brooke, Helen, Katelyn, and Brad a little. I got to know people like Zayin and Kaz a little better, which, in Zayin's case, was very strange. Lol. We went on a zillion hikes, and I was the first one to stand under the waterfall on our first hike. It was soo cool! And my shoes were dubbed slugs soon after Matt were. His are dead- smooshy and flat, and mine are on thier way out as well. I also was the only girl who fully slid down the snow hill, in my tshirt, on my stomach. That was a blast and when I got to the bottom everyone was cheering and stuff. Whee!! Anyway, I can't write anymore I'm feeling lonely. Tootles. ~Ana~

      Oh I am so excited! I think I am getting this babysitting job tomorrow, and the mom is paying 7.50 an hour! I will be there for 5 hours! That means I will get paid 37.50 for one day. Not bad, and that is just with one kid. Holy cow! And he's pretty little too, I think. Lol. I have gotten two, or more like three votes for my emails. Bets voted for the Peter_Pan_272 And Annie said pick the same if the numbers were sentimental to anything, but she liked the tension between Peter and Hook. So as it stands: Peter_Pan_272 I Peter_Pan_vs_Hook I ARGH ~Ana~

      I just finished reading the coolest book last night. It is called Pirates came to Brooklyn. It is about these two girls who are in leauge with Peter Pan- one is a Christian and the other a Jew. Their parents don't get along too well. But they both love stories, and they band together to help Peter fight the invisible crooks. The Jewish girl, Lee, even learns how to fly! I just love the fun of it. The story of Peter Pan and all of the Lost Boys and Hook and Smee and Neverland has always entranced me- I wish it was real. Where kids could fly and battle pirates! And you would never grow old. I wish I could go there.... Lol. Anyway, on to the next subject. My birthday. I know it isn't until October, but I am still really excited- I am gonna be 15. Wowsers! Here's what I want to do since it is my golden borthday. I want to spend the night at the hotel in town and play in the pool and rent a movie and stuff like that. And maybe eat dinner at Alfy's. The only problem would be how much it would cost and if my mom would let me and my friends stay at a hotel all by ourselves for a whole night. If she can send me on an airplane to California all by myself when I was 7, she can surely let me and a couple friends spend the night at a hotel in town, right? Oh well. I am so ready to drive though!! Not for the cost though. I have to get a job somehow/ Mom says that I have all my life to work, and to just enjoy being a kid, and I am, but I also don't want to go through all of my childhood not knowing how to work, you know? And andother thing that sucks, while I'm at it- I have a                            it-zay. BARF. I mum says that if I get acne now I won't get wrinkly as fast, but I really wish I didn't have to deal with those stupid zits. I envy people like Hilary whose worst zit has been a teeny-tiny little thing where nobody is gonna notice it. Anyway, why in the world am I rambling on about zits when I should be thinking of a new email? I don't know. Here are my ideas so far: Peter_Pan_272 - This is my favorite so far Peter_Pan_vs_Hook - Not too bad actually.... Peter's_Lost_Girl - This sounds like I am talking about my boyfriend, which I don't have one... Lets take a poll. I don't like the one on the bottom so much but I'll leave it there. I think I am going to pick the top one, though the middle is okay.  Write and tell me which one you like!! ~Ana~

      Weekends are always a fighting point with me and my parents. I am always onto the next thing when it comes to sleepovers and hanging out with friends. I didn't have any friends, nor any sleepovers this weekend, because it was about my sister (she had a birthday sleepover) and my parents, who went out to dinner with some of their friends. That's ok though. On Saturday we went to my brother Emmett's baseball game, and boy was that funny! The boys are pretty young- some are only 6 or 7! There is one friend of my brother's names Timmy, and they usually have him play catcher, which he hates. This week he didn't have to catch, and as he ran out to the left field he was all " THANK HEAVEN! I DON'T HAVE TO CATCH!!" It was quite funny. You could tell the boys were tired of playing by the ongoing ballet dancing, glove and hat throwing, and rolling that was going on in the outfield. That was very entertaining as well.  My friend saw this site of mine and decided to set up her own. It is quite nice, all pink and stuff. She is a talented poet and she has already posted one of her pretty rhymes. If you want to read it, here's the link: http://andreabrownie.blogspot.com/ I write poetry too, but not the same time she does. Here's a sample so you know what NOT to expect from her :P Here's one that I wrote a couple years ago. I am not really proud of it, but here it is anyway: Rushing, Tumbling, Swirling, Rippling, Such are the actions of a river so wild, Yet somehow there is a sereneness about it. Perhaps it is the crystal clear, sparkling part? Yet how can something so dangerous remind me of a cold glass of water?  Tumbling, Pushing, Rolling, Splashing,  That is the way of the river- To give a sense of danger and excitement, But to also reveal a clear serenity that not even the most eloquent poets can put to words.... And now for Number two; (This one is very similar) Shining, Flashing, Tumbling, Crashing, Rushing, Curving, Whooshing, Splashing, The water rushed on it's speedy way, Jumping over rocks, dashing through crevices; That's the way the water runs. Slipping, Sliding, Thumping, Bumping, Crashing, Flopping, Falling, Dashing, The river is an endless playground, Children falling, Children crawling,  Looking for hidden animals and caves, Those are the most precious treasures the river hides...  Like I said, crap. But they are ok. I read them on yucky days when I need to feel like I am next to that river, feeling it's anger and speed, you know? I feel it even when I am typing. It takes me into a whirlwind of sounds and thoughts. A picture of something, colors and words all swirled together. Wow. Anyway, not to bore whoever is reading this with senseless blah, I'll move on from my sucky poetry. My brother always tells me that I never write long enough blogs, so here is a REALLY long blog. I won't be able to write one Wednesday through Friday because I will be at Mount Saint Helens with my school science class camp. I think it will be ok, though it would be better if I had some good friends coming. Not to saythat Helen and Katelyn and Susannah aren't good friends, but they aren't the same as Hilary and Hanna and Carly even, who know my secrets- it's more fun to talk about your secrets with people who understand them, you know? Oh well, I think it will still be pretty fun, tiring, but fun. We are going on three hikes on Mount Saint Helen's, which will keep me plenty busy, I'll say. Whew, that was a lot of writing wasn't it? I have to go, I am about to run out of time for tonight. Talk to ya later!! ~Ana~

      YAY! School is out. Kind of.I am still trying to cathc up on my math, but no more classes for me! The only thing I HATE about summer is the flies. I despise flies- they are so nasty and gross and they are on everything!! I wish God would kill them All!! AAAHHH. Sorry. Got a little carried away there. You know, i was up until 11 last night helping my mom redo our kitchen, and then I slept in until noon. My little sister's friend was like "Ana, why did you sleep so long?" and my mom was all "Because she is a teenager honey"  Nearly all the teenagers I know only sleep in until 9:30 or 10-even on Saturday! Isn't that strange? My mom says I need about as much sleep as a 2 year old, which is gratifying and embarassing at the same time... Lol. I need to go. I am painting in the kitchen today and I need to get started.... TTYL Banana Ana

      Turkey-cheese sandwich. Chocolate milk. Cheetos. Best lunch you could find- yup.  I am going to miss all the guys at school- Jordan and his great math-stalling skills, Brandon and his poofy hair and gay lines, Austin and his glasses and earring (yes, just one), Joyce and her playing (:P), Holly and her cheerleading,  Monique and her sense of humor, Gabby and her birthday chair, Emily and...herself! Lol. And all the other great journalism peoples. I WILL MISS YA'LL. But here's the cool thing. I will send you the link to my blog site (this is it in case you don't know) and you can read all the stupid things I have to say. I have to get myself a properly hosted website, but I can't yet. I am totally coming back to journalism just so you all know- what would I do without my writing? And Austin, if you are reading this, I am going to overthrow your Op-Ed throne next year. But I'll still need Mike's editorial cartoons... :P Hope you don't mind. I wonder who will get to be editor next year. I am trying to think of someone in class that I would vote for. Who do you think? I am taking a poll here, and NOT trying to get votes. I tried it once and I don't think I am going to get any support. Everyone keeps telling me not to beat myself up about it but I kinda can't help it- that year kinda sucked, but I am getting over it, I think. Anyway, check this site whenever you want to see what I have been up to, and post a reply if you feel like it- that would be way cool. And Austin and Ellie- aside from my one metro/gay guy, is old-school anime ok?  Email me you guys!! ~Banana Ana~

      Now I have a penpal! His name is Jeremy, he's 14, and he lives in Manhattan. He's going to Egypt this summer and I think I am going to get a souveneir! Yay! I already have a scarab from some rich guy's tomb, and I have yet to be able to figure out what it says on the underside. There are a bunch of heiroglyphs on the bottom but it is the "cursive" version of heiroglyphs so I can't read it.....  I am making gifts for my friends for the last day of school-  Ellie is getting the tie I promised her and Monique gets a Switchfoot cd and a Make-Your-Own-Guitar-Pick-Necklace Kit. I think that's it, we are reviewing the newpspaper in class right now and I have to be able to listen to corrections and stuff. TTYL Banana Ana

      Science project is DONE!! A whole almost 30 pages of it. Hilary took a picture of us and photoshopped it into a nature background, which worked better than going out and taking a picture of us in the actual field. Whew. I'm typing this on a laptop, and it is kinda hard... I think I'll live though.... We went to Potterpuppetpals and watched snape dance, harry and ron bother snape, and harry, ron and hermione used machine guns on voldemordt.....

      Today is environments day at school. Gr. We were supposed to bring our bugs but I am done with those so I didn't- what moron wants to lug a box of bugs around school all day? And last night we had a thunder and lightning storm, wich really sucked. The electricity went out at almost 11pm, and I ended up having our dog, Pepper, who is no little puppy, sleep on the foot of my bed. She would bark every time a clap of thunder sounded, and I had massage her ears to make her stop. By the time the thunder was over for the night it was 2:30, an I got up at 7:20 this morning. I was SO TIRED!! I need about 11 hours of sleep, and I only got 5. Not happy. I want to take a nap.... Yawn. I made my brother a website too, because he was kinda down. :( Anyway, i have a Powerpoint presentation due today- 25 pages of it, so I'd better get to work, huh? Lol.

      There is a time in the school year when you are all ready to go to school- you might even want summer to be over faster! I get that feeling when I am planning classes for my next school year, or when I have run out of things to do over the summer. But this is NOT One of those times. I am ready for school to be done. I spent all morning in jounrnalism class helping out with yearbook stuff (don't ask) and I am going to be here until 3:30 tonight. Wah. I got my yearbook today, and have been hunting people down to get them to sign. Lol. Mom is going to kill me when she finds out that I used up nearly two signature pages on myself, when I am supposed to share with my brothers. Whoops. I have actually not had my picture in the yearbook for 2 years now. It is gratifying, in a way, but also sad. I want to show my kids someday "What a doofus mummy looked like in High School." Lol. I will get some in next year though, no fear.  Austin has a new pair of glasses every week I swear! Last week it was kid's hotwheels sunglasses (Austin, if you are reading this, those were great!) and this week it's a shiny greenish pair. What will come on Friday? Do I even want to know? I should get him some for the end of the year.... :P I am going to be at school 4 days a week next year. Journalism, Health, Spanish I, and Geometry. I will be either swimming or playing volleyball for PE. Yay! I am looking for a penpal in a foreign country (I am in the good old US of A) but I really want to meet someone from Ireland. I am currently writing to a girl in the UK, which is cool. Anyway, I think that is all, except to dedicate this page to my best friends: Hilary, Kristin, Betsey, Annie, Ellie, Sammie, Hanna, Carly, Jesse, Andrea, Mum and Dad, Joyce, McKenna, and so many more. I'll list more next time. Loves!! ~Ana~

               &nbsp;    Well, now I am back! After 3 busy weeks I finally have had the chance to get online and write about my hectic life. First there was fourth of July- a big party and lotsa peoples- as well as tons and tons of foreworks. Then the day after, at about 8 in the morning we (me and my crazy brother) left for California. Then, after ten days there, we return, and the next weekend I start my week as a counselor for a church day camp. And now I am trying to remember what the term "down time" means again. Lol.      In California we did so much stuff I thought I&nbsp;was going to explode! We spent the first almost 3 days with my mom's parents, and that was pretty quiet- reading, drawing, shopping a little, and we went to see Around The World in 80 Days. I got my purse and my wallet when I was there, as well as a good crop of fantastic homemade food. Then we went to stay with my dad's side of the family for the rest of our visit. The day after we got to their house we took a little trip to a place I like to call DISNEYLAND!! We stayed there long enough to see that parade, but then we had to head back because my aunt, who had come with us, had some homework she needed to finish- she's a nurse at UI and she just transferred from Hoag so she had some stuff to wrap up. It was a lot of fun though- we had lunch there, as well as an afternoon snack at a really cool ice cream parlor on Main Street. We rented a wheelchair for the day, mainly for my grandma, who has rather a bad back, but we all got to ride in it at some point or another, which is where they got the idea that I am a bad driver or something- where they came up with a crazy idea like that I have no idea! Lol.      After that we had a day of rest, and at around 8pm we left for Kelly's house- my Aunt Cheryl's friend. Me, my brother, my grandparents and my awesome Uncle John, along with my Aunt's friend Kelly, were going to spend a weekend in a house on the Colorado River. We left at about 8:30pm and finally got there at about 2am. The heat at that time was amazing! It was at least 85 degrees! And by the time we got all settled in and ready for bed it was about 4:45 or 5am. My cousin Jacob, who joined us on the way, as well as my brother and I, spent the night outside, and were woken up at about 8am because of the heat- it was already almost 100 degrees!! We spent the day swimming in the river and the pool, as well as riding the sea-doos, that Kelly brought. I got to drive once, and then we saw someone getting a ticket for driving a sea-doo underage (which is under 16) a $500 ticket. So after that we had to hang onto an adult for the rest of the day, which was fun anyway, though my Uncle John drives like a crazy person. So we hung out, and the next day we got to ride around a little more in the morning, and I rode with my uncle John again, and we hit a crest sideways and flipped over- it was SO COOL!! Lol. Then we spent the rest of the week hanging out, and we got to go see movies and go shopping and stuff too.      Then after I got back I went as a counselor at a day camp with my church called Wonder Camp. I loved working with the kids, and my big sister experience paid off in the end because I was named as Camp Counselor of the Year, which sure made me feel special. Now I am trying to remember what free time means, and on top of all of that it is hot and sticky and I am feeling excessively crabby. Argh.     Later.....     Ana
