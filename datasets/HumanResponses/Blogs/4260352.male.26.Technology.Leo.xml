      Last night I did not feel like going out. I could have stayed in no problem yet, the tempting call from Jay arrives and with it the thoughts of good times, good friends, good beer! So naturally I have to answer the call!  So it's 10pm and RAINING! Not good when you want to go drinking on a summer night. The bars were dead. I mean DEAD. It was like being in a cemetery but, when your out with us your guaranteed to have a good time. Excess amounts of beer also help.  Right... so we drove by Copperfields and it's dead. So over to the Red Lion, our local watering hole. We get to the Lion Rouge and the pulse of the bar is close to dead also. So instinctively each get a pint and know that we will have to be "on" tonight and provide our own entertainment (like we have not had to do that before). Ok, to the patio and James puts up the umbrella as Jay and I wait until it is up before going out. Why should three people have to get wet? Pints, dry table, fags. Looks like we have what we need.  Later on the night got better when Heather and Alex came in for a pint after they finished up work. It is always nice to see great looking girls! Alex, Heather and I all went to high school together and don't really see each other that much at all, just on a rare occasion when we are all in town and out at the bars.  Anyhow, the beer gets flowing and the rain stops. After a few pints we headed over to Copperfields. It was still dead. No, I mean we were the only ones there when we walked in. So the five of us get pints and I get out my camera. Paparazzi time! We snapped tons of shots, being totally silly and half drunk. What can I say we had fun.

       Tuesday, yup it sure feels like a Tuesday. It was an uneventful night. Watched Big Brother 5, which is good for an American version for once. But now where near as good as the British version. Gotta love those Brits.  Other than surfing the usual chat rooms and chat sites, my night was quiet. Wait, Mr. Flash made an appearance tonight, brief yet, effective.       And now to see what Wednesday holds.
