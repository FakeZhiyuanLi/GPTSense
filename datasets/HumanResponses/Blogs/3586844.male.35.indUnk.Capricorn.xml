      Well England are out of Euro 2004. Quel surprise. The played badly and even if  urlLink Sol Campbell's goal  had been allowed I don't think they deserved to win.  My next-door neighbours installed a wood-burning stove in their conservatory on Saturday. The chimney is only about 3 metres above ground level, below the level of my bedroom window.     The smoke blows right in. I'm sure that planning permission is required for a chimney and that both the Environmental Protection Act and the Clean Air Act have been infringed. I shall be in touch with the local council about this.

      England are through to the Euro 2004 quarter finals after beating Croatia 4-2 last night!  Congratulations to the  urlLink Scaled Composites Tier One  team on their space flight. Quite an achievement really considering the budget. The BBC's live webcast was definitely worth watching. I was surprised that for such an important mission the pilot's attitude was so frivolous - letting M&Ms float around the cabin in zero-g. What if one had got stuck in an important flight control?  It reminded me of the attitude of the American air-traffic controllers when I hired a Cessna in Florida a few years ago. Compared with the draconian precision and pedantry of British ATC it seemed very lax. Maybe things are different now in the wake of 9-11.

      Well England succeeded in partially redeeming themselves in Euro 2004 last night by beating Switzerland 3-0. However if Croatia play as well as they did against France (2-2) then we may have a problem on Monday. Ho Hum.  This week a lot of things have fallen into place at work. I've managed to finish off a number of tasks including two PCB designs and a couple of bits of software.  I'm now looking forward to a quiet weekend with a clear conscience, oh and it's Friday lunchtime so we're all off for a pub lunch!

       Well the past weekend has been eventful:   England's humiliating 2-1 defeat at the hands of the French. I reckon Heskey will get lynched for giving away the penalty in extra time.  England's humiliating 36 - 3 defeat at the hands of the All-Blacks  The UK Independence party's humiliating (to the other parties) gain of 12 seats in the European elections   At least there has been something positive. One of my colleagues has offered continental breakfasts on Friday to anyone who cycles in to work this week. This was the incentive I needed! This morning, being the first time I've cycled to work this year, I was only 54 seconds outside my personal best of 22m52s.

      Well, I did my bit for democracy this morning and voted. I'm slightly concerned that because of the unpopularity of the major parties, some of the extremists will make considerable gains. It appears to me that there are a lot of people in this country who are persuaded by the nationalist media, to believe anything. I am a pro-European and think that we should be taking a more active role in European policy as well as signing up for the Euro. The right-wing press and the UK Independence Party, for example, would have you believe that we would have to forfeit the Queen's head on our coins. This is NOT TRUE! Take The Netherlands for example - Queen Beatrix's head is still on their Euro coins. It would be nice if people took the time to discover the full picture before acting like sheep and following the flock.

      I've just created my first Blog. This is really just a test to see how well it works and whether I need to change any options. I've elected to host the Blog on my own website instead of on the blogger.com server. I hope this works!

      My new PC monitor arrived today - a 20.1 inch 1600 x 1200 TFT. Very nice.  I forgot to mention the biking adventure I went on a couple of weeks ago. How could I forget!  I rode up to near Chipping Norton and met up with about 30 other members of the Oxford Honda Owners' Club. We then set off on a nearly 200 mile round trip going through Bicester, Oakley, Stokenchurch, Marlow, Henley and stopping for lunch in Benson.      Mine's the blue one on the extreme right.    Then on to Goring, Wantage, Lambourn, Childrey, Shrivenham, Highworth with an ice-cream break near Lechlade. Then on through Burford and back to Chipping Norton. After&nbsp;the&nbsp;late-afternoon BBQ I made my way back home; another 40 miles!   It's another BBQ tonight too. I mustn't eat too much though, my weight-loss is progressing well.

      I feel I ought to say something as it's been nearly two weeks since my last post.  My sister came up from Cornwall on Monday; it's only the second time she's been to my house in 7 years. We then drove up to Mundesley in Norfolk for my uncle's funeral on Tuesday. The service was good and it was nice to meet my aunt, cousins and their families. We stayed the night at my cousin Jeff's house. On Wednesday morning we got to see my cousin's collection of Ducatis and then we met up with the other relatives for a game of crazy golf. I got a hole-in-one on the second so bought a round of drinks for everyone in the pub afterwards.  Tania (my sister) and I drove back to Didcot in the afternoon and then had a 4-hour panic trying to locate my sister's partner, Ken. Apparently he had got lost trying to find my house and hadn't thought to phone or ask for directions!  Well I'm knackered; the weekend starts here ...

      I went on a 2-day first aid refresher course this week so I'm now re-qualified as a first-aider. My knee is feeling a bit better since the injury and I'm now walking without a limp.  I fixed the tail on the R/C plane and took it flying this afternoon. It hadn't been up long when a gust of wind flipped it inverted out of control and it hit the ground vertically nose down. The motor mounting has now broken and the tail has come off again; interestingly the tail break is in a new place - my repair held fast. I haven't had a lot of luck with the plane so far!  On Friday evening I went to the Henley festival with a few friends. This took my mind off the death of my uncle on Thursday. There was some interesting art and the firework display was impressive.  Oh well, back to work tomorrow.

      Well, it's been an eventful week. On Thursday I played football in a company 5-a-side tournament. Our team won all of their group matches and qualified for the final. During the final I semi-dislocated my knee and had to come off. Despite my absence, the team went on to win!  My parents came up from Cornwall for the weekend and are off to France for a few weeks starting today.  Saturday was Dad's "Founders' Day" at Dulwich college. He was there from 1942-1947. We went up for the lunch and to have a look around. It would have been a lot more enjoyable if we hadn't got fouled up in the Wimbledon traffic. It took us 2&frac12; hours to get from Hammersmith to Dulwich!  On Sunday, when I was able to walk again, I took my radio-controlled plane up to Wittenham Clumps. It's a popular flying site and there were about half a dozen other fliers there. Everything went well until I tried to land. The wind caught the plane from behind making the controls ineffective and I proceeded to crash into a fence. The crash only caused some minor dents on the leading edge of the wings but unfortunately when we retrieved the plane over the fence the tail detached. The tail joint was pre-assembled when I bought the kit and I don't think it was particularly strong. I'll be off to the model shop at lunchtime to get some balsa to repair it.

      Mum and Dad arrived back from France late on Wednesday night. I had to go to work on Thursday but took Friday off. I took Dad over to the golf course at Faringdon on the back of the bike. Mum went by car and took the clubs! We played golf and I was only one shot behind Dad at the end. I was quite pleased since Dad plays a lot and I haven't played much at all recently. My putting was surprisingly good; maybe the crazy golf helped! Mum and Dad are off back to Cornwall tomorrow.  Bad news - I've discovered a few hot pixels on my digital camera.

      It's August. For most of the Northern hemisphere that means summer; nice sunny days when you wish you were outside instead of cooped up inside an office. Not in good old blighty. Here we had storms. Not just any storms, mind you, but some of the worst thunderstorms to hit Britain in a long while. Pershore in Worcestershire had 46mm of rain.  A 14 year old boy was killed when struck by lightning. A shopping centre in Staines had its roof collapse and there was extensive flooding throughout the country.   urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3533022.stm   At work the gutters in the roof overflowed, pouring litres of water into our despatch area. We were also hit by incredible winds which blew most of the Rockwool roofing insulation off the new building going up next door; the workers had spent all morning laying it!  Needless to say I didn't relish the idea of going to the Honda Owners' Club meeting on the bike this evening.
