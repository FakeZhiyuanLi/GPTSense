      I'm feeling better now. A lot better actually. I'm getting together with close friends, have had a relaxing day, and... &nbsp; I just got a puppy and he's absolutely adorable!! I love him so much and he's gotten rid of my bad mood so quickly just because he's so innocent and loves without caring about faults. I'm so glad I have a pet again. It seems like pets are the only things that can truly love someone, becuase it doesn't matter what you look like or what your faults are. I suggest everyone have a pet. It's one of the best things in the world. &nbsp; ~Just a quick uplifting~

      For the first entry- a pissed off person. Fun, yes? Notes: The titles I have are random usually and if they're not and you don't understand, don't ask please. *AND* I  really  don't like saying "fuck" and am trying not to curse as much, but with this family, that seems IMPOSSIBLE.  Okay. This is it. Again. I DESPISE this damn family and can NOT wait to get the hell out of here. Two more fucking years. My whole mood just died and went to hell when my mom and brother came home. My brother's been a fucking brat and my damn parents refuse to admit it's their damn fault because they give him whatever the fuck he wants! So I'm dealing with his whining, squealing and screaming at high-pitched frequencies because my mother's too fucking busy with the mail. And she's already pissed because of something at work, so it's just dandy. Now, she makes dinner and burns the steak so she's pissed off more. I eat, Zach eats, then my parents (my dad had come home) come out of the bedroom from arguing "in private" and eat. I clean up and my dad says to my brother "Don't worry, Sam'll play with you." then gets pissed off that I got pissed off. Gee, why would I be pissed off? Maybe because I don't feel like listening to my brother complain for hours or I have something else to do, or, *gasp* wait now- maybe for the simple fact that he didn't just ASK me!! *gasp...yet again* Imagine that, me being tired of my dad just saying I said something or I'll do something. Now some of you might say "this isn't new; parents don't ask thier kids to do stuff"...well this is where it's my parents fault. My dad used to -always- say please and thank you and ask me to do things. So now that he doesn't, it pisses me off. If he asked, I wouldn't be that bad about it. So I play Crash Bandicoot with Zach for an hour and listen and deal with his shit. He's sent to bed at 9- an hour after he's supposed to be in bed. Now my father starts screaming about how much his life sucks, how my mom is annoying (reasonably so), and goes on a long-ass rant about me. He apparently gets along with me best, but if this is best, I don't wanna be close to him. I've decided to just keep to my damn self. But here are a few points and quotes from the rant:- "she goes out too fucking much"- I "don't do a goddamn thing in this house"- always have an attitude- lately I've been a "lazy bitch"Okay. I'm fucking 16 years old!! Of course I want to go out and have fun! Why? Because later I'll have too many responsibilities! And I do do things around the house!! I love how my cleaning, help watching Zach (because my mom doesn't watch him >_>), and doing anything else they ask doesn't count for a damn thing. So while this rant is going on, loud enough for me to hear, of course, I get in the bath to relax and ignore them before I explode. My mom comes in later and bitches at me for all the reasons my dad brought up. >_> That was fun. I wanted to tell her to just get the fuck out. (on top of it all, I got cuts on my knees from falling and hitting the faucet in the tub...just adds to my good mood, you know?) So I got online to chat, chill and shit. And of course, he wakes up, comes in, and bitches at me. Fucking hell. The worst fucking part is how they make me feel like shit and like they're the best fucking people in the world. >_> I can NOT wait until college! And then they wonder why I love school so much! It's so sad I'm counting down to the first fucking day of school...(the above was written last night...the below is from this morning)So my dad calls me at 8am to wake me up. He bitches at me MORE for last night, bringing up stupid shit from weeks ago. Then he says, "since you're so ungrateful, you'll get to wake up when I do (5am) so you know what it's like". Uh...I got up at 5am every fucking day I had school! So he's going to call me everyday to make sure I'm up. And so far, he's called me 3x to make sure I'm up and each time I pick up he bitches at me more because I'm such a bad child. I swear to fucking G-d! If I'm so damn bad, why the hell doesn't he save us all the headache and send me the fuck away?! He always complains about how bad I am but I don't do much. Yes, I can be in a bitchy mood- but so can he. And he usually is because he truly hates his life and choices. Yes, I can be lazy- but so can he. It's all the same. I'm not a horrible child and I'm tired of listening to them because it's like they're trying to break me down. Well FUCK OFF is all that goes through my head. I'm tired of dealing and I don't want to be here anymore. I keep saying it's almost over, but it's too fucking long.So the final analysis? I'm pissed off beyond belief, would give  ANYTHING  to be off at college, have 2 cuts on my knees, a burn on my hand (from helping with dinner), and am lacking in sleep. So it should be a wonderful day in the fucking neighborhood.This is almost the exact same thing as in my livejournal, so sorry if you just read both. Don't want to sound like a bitch, but deal. I'm in a bitchy mood, so I guess my family's right, ne?  &nbsp; ~ Just the rantings...nothing else~

      Otakon is coming in 4 days!! And I'm spazzing to make my cosplay costume! It's really weird, but I feel excited like at Christmas...is that sad? Meh. I don't care, I have fun. There isn't much going on besides the excitement for Otakon. So I'm just getting this updated, so the no one that reads it can't say I don't update. XP Wow. Writing to no one. It's weird, writing like this- to no one as if I am talking to someone- is strangely relaxing. Even when it's about nothing. Weird.
