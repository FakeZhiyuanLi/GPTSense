      And I'm back :) I hope this one goes under Saturday, rather than Wednesday again... otherwise I'll be angry. lol.   There is something wrong with my eye lol. It won't stop tearing, and it's like completely red. But I don't think it's pink-eye, because it's not itchy or anything; just painful. So I won't be wearing contacts for a while, and if this lasts until Monday I'll have to wear glasses :'( Nooo!   I saw the animated Sinbad last night, while my parents were out at dinner or something. Loved it! Animation has seriously gotten so advanced since Bambi, it's insane. Sure, the characters looked like Bugs Bunny and all, but the scenery was incredible; I especially loved the ocean. I also think Sinbad is cute, so that helps, too. I thought they could have done a better job with the script; Marina fell in love with Sinbad after what, 2 days? I don't think so. Especially when she's engaged with the guy's best friend. It reminded me of the Road to El Dorado, and I  love  that movie! N insists that I've never seen the actual end to it, but I think I have. I also remember having a crush on one of the guys. I forget which. Is there a blonde one? Because I think he was blonde...   And there ^^^ is actual proof that I'm a loser :D Who gets crushes on animations??   But to be honest, the Road to El Dorado was really cute.  Much  better than the Emperor's New Groove, which I hated and thought was stupid and etc etc etc.   Ever noticed how, in all animated movies, there's the smart clever one and the stupid sweet one? Or just the quick and the slow one? It's insane; they're all basically the same. I think I watch too many animated films. Wait, no, I take that back: there is  no such thing  as too many animated films! I love 'em! Long live Disney and all those other great animator people!   What else is new... oh, I might not be watching Donnie Darko tonight after all *cries* Simply because I'm too lazy to make my mum drive me out to Blockbuster, but whatever, it's still sad. I really wanted to see it. Haha, I had recommended it to B because I had read a review of it, and it sounded really good, but I hadn't actually seen it yet. And then she saw it, and was like, thank you! But I still hadn't seen it, so then I was like thank  you  for reminding me that this movie still existed! And then R said it was good too, so now I've got two people who think it's awesome. And I'm still too lazy to drive out to Blockbuster. hehehe. I'm going to be a bum when I grow up.   Speaking of bums, mine is sore from sitting in front of this computer for so long. Unfortunately, I can't think of anything else to do. Nothing's on T.V. until at least 4:00, soo..   So anyways, I have no more to say. Au revoir, a bientot, and pray to whoever you want that I'm not sick by Monday. lol.

      Today was... alright. I'm beginning to feel like I need to have a crush on someone. Not because I actually  like  someone, but because otherwise I feel very pointless. Anyone else feel like that sometimes?   But anyways, the more I thought about that, the more I realized - hmm, the reason I don't have a crush on anyone, is because there  isn't  anyone. Or at least anyone I'd consider having a crush on. See my problem? It is the inescapable circle of doom!! *dum dum dummm*   So  then  I thought, I need to meet more anyones. Which means, I need to go out more and meet more people, because the CDS pool of anyones is sorely lacking. Which means, I need some sort of hobby, since piano guys aren't really my type (or at least until they hit puberty). Which means, I need ideas! And no sports, since I loathe sports.   Or, better idea: instead of  me  meeting people on my own, someone can just  introduce  me to anyones! Any takers? hehe. Just kidding, just kidding.   But I mean honestly. This is weird. I dislike this feeling intensely. I want to  eradicate  it. Isn't that an awesome word? I decided I liked that word today, and that I wanted to use it. So there you go: eradicate. Muahaha. It gives me Dr. Evil-type shivers, you know?   So after all that blathering, I really haven't made a point. And since I don't have one, I've decided I'll be silent, and leave you all in peace. heh. Au revoir!

      Have I ever mentioned how cool A was? I mean honestly. She stole my skin, and I got play-mad, and she changed it! Now how cool is that? She is an honest-to-goodness cool person. I am proud to know her!   Other news... would include I am sickeningly proud of my Garden Gnome piece I wrote on Monday for eng... (hahaha, I might even post that, because I love it soooo much).    ... would include I'm still struggling to come up with an idea for my privilege-themed short story. I wrote one on the snow day, but I'm not sure if it's good or not :S Therefore, no one can read it. I'm going to look over it again on Saturday or Sunday to decide if it's trash material or not.   ... would include I am absolutely inspired by Gwin Dier (or however you spell it) - since most of you suckers aren't in music, you'll have no idea what I'm talking about, so: the Furby let us have our music class off, and go to the PAC to see Mr. Dier talk about neo-cons, Iraq and Pax Americana, because the Furby (and me too, now) worships this man. He's a famous journalist/genius who got started in journalism just by accident - he started off as a historian! Man! This could be me! *ahem* Anyway, to be quick and cheap and easy, he has some brilliant theories about what's going on with the U.S. and this 'war on terror,' as well as a great writer (and speaker), AS WELL as a terrific sense of humour. To be even quicker and cheaper and easier, he is my idol. Along with Neil Gaiman. I will worship them both.   ... would include me considering taking up the harp again. That's right, folks, I used to play the celtic harp. Not one of those massive orchestral beasts, but a rough and small celtic harp, that brought to mind either Irish pubs or Irish fairies, depending on your nature. My old teacher, let's call him RE, just left a message after basically a year of no contact, saying that I'm really musical, that he's always there for me to talk to about music, and that this is not a sales pitch. I'm inclined to disagree, but hey, flattery has worked in the past and will work again. I'd only take lessons in the summer, of course; school work is too hectic right now, but my mum misses the sound of my harp and I kind of do too. Whether this is because of the recent flattery or my obsession with all things Irish and green, we'll find out this summer.   So that's all for now, folks (I've used folks twice in this blog - RE is already influencing me - expect some hippieness, guys), so see ya'll tomorrow.

      No, I haven't disappeared from the face of the earth. Although I wish I did, merely because that sounds interesting. lol. On Friday I managed to convince mummy dear (and yes that's sarcasm, for all of you who are stupid) that it was far too dangerous to go driving to school. About an hour later (too late to get there :p), mummy dear realized I was a jerk and she should have driven us anyways =D   Muahaha. Now, to take over the world...   Anyways, other than that life is pretty good. Kinda boring, just because that is basically life's definition, but I won't complain too much about it. Oh! Also mad at Amy (hehe) because she didn't invite me to Caila's party! :p lollll. I wouldn't have been able to come; I had a piano master class - but  still ! Amy, I am appalled and disgustified at your behaviour. heh.   Something else that's interesting... I'm sure some of you have at least heard of the book Life of Pi, and mummy dear and I were talking about it on the way to my master class... I haven't read it yet, but mum thinks I should, because apparently the theme is pretty cool (or at least, her/her book club's take on it) - life based on a good story (as in, based on a religion or faith) is better than life without one (as in, reality). Yes? No? I can't really decide. I mean, avoiding what the world is really like (we live, we die, that's it, nothing more) by believing, without any sort of evidence other than that belief, in a religion... that seems kind of wimpy. Shouldn't we face the world head on? Accept what we're given, deal with it, not go 'into denial' like most people do? Take the blue pill, instead of the red pill? Or vica versa, since I haven't seen the Matrix for a loong time.. hehe.   But then again, there's nothing wrong with being happy. If living a lie (I guess I'm kind of biased towards living reality lol) lets you deal with life's undeniable injustices, and maybe make some good out of it, then would the lie itself be worth it?   Questions, questions, questions... The question I asked up there ^^^ gets me started on another... do the ends justify the means? Peter asked this crazy question to me and Murdles and some others a few weeks ago (haha, we even have it on tape lol): if, by murdering an innocent, you could solve world hunger, would you? I still have no idea what my answer would be. And I'll shut up now, before I launch into another crazy philosophical debate with myself. I'll just ... keep it in my head. lol :p

      I feel incredibly sick at the mo lol. My throat is threatening murder, and I've got an icky taste in my mouth. Thankfully, though, my piano lesson is cancelled without me having to plead maladie. lol. Not so great is that this means I have to go to piano on Thursday.   Not that I don't like piano! I love it. And I love my teacher, too, he's the best lol. But I'm just a lazy bum and I hate having to leave my beloved computer and T.V. and food to find out about how I'm not doing my technique very well :p I mean, once I leave the lesson, I'm always happy and in a good mood; but up to and until then, I'm rather miserable.   Anyways, speaking of my computer (not that we were), I'm going to play the Sims. Because that's a damn fun game and I like ruling other people's lives. hehehe..

      Oh god. The semi sucked. I hated it. Very, very boring. Everyone at my table was great, but we were so isolated from everyone else, and the reserved places made everyone seem so categorized - you could only hang out with your table, it seemed.    Add the fact that all my guy friends brought a date, making it exceedingly awkward to make stupid jokes with them, didn't help.   Add to that the shoes, which look like the sexiest shoes in the world, but in truth are the most agonizingly painful.   Add to that the frozen food, the discomfort of a strapless bra, the frustration at knowing no eligible guys to date, and the fear that there never will be an eligible guy to date - well, let's just say that it made a pretty pot of horrors.    By the way, it's not so much the fact that I want a boyfriend, it's that I want someone who I can just be myself with; I honestly don't know anyone who's like that. I want the comfort of knowing that somebody loves me - friends somewhat give that comfort, but there's nothing like a kiss on the cheek.   Heh, not that I'd know - for all I know, boyfriends are absolute hell. I am such a naive little innocent. I haven't even seen American Pie. Which sucks, because everyone else has. I'm still not fully aware of the significance of the phrase, "This one time, at band camp." I feel very left out. lol.   Anyways, at least A's sleepover was interesting. I love her room; she has inspired me and I've decided I'm going to go nuts decorating mine, too. Go markers and doodles and rubber duckies! Not only that, but C looked remarkably like the sister of a guy I used to crush on. I keep forgetting to ask her if she has relatives in O. That would be so cool, if she was related to him. And I wouldn't be too surprised, either; they look so alike, it's not even funny. I got the heebiejeebies just looking at her lol.   I'm done my rambling now, ciao :)

      I've made my comments look prettier (not the window that pops up, since I don't know how to do that yet), and I've also decided I am chronically bored.   Been thinking about what to write my personal essay on; I've had a few ideas. Here goes:   1. What I learned as a hillbilly at the farm :) You know, how to be happy with the simple things in life, what I learned from the animals, the 'slight disdain' (read: disgust/hilarity) I feel towards people who are terrified of frogs and insects, working hard, traditions, memories, etc. Also about what I learned when I left the farm; the farm would be my childhood, and moving closer to civilization (heh) would be growing up. I'm still not sure if I like this yet.   2. What I learned from my Camp Arowhon trip. Or however you spell that. I hated that trip. I loathed it. No offense to those who were in my homeroom last year, but I loathed you all. Every one of you. The few friends I had made were way off in different cabins, and that entire trip was sheer torture for me. In fact, I'm not even sure what I learned from that trip; it's just such an awful scar in my memory that I figured it must have  some  meaning.   3. Make some shiz up, tell 'em it's the gosh-darned truth, and come home with $1000. lol.   So, that's what I've come up with so far. Right now I'm closest to choosing the farm-related idea; in fact, I had come up with this awesome first paragraph in the shower last night - except then the power went out, and I forgot everything. All I remember is that it was beautiful, sweet and mildly amusing. Other than that, I'm clueless. So that's no good. Fortunately, I've got over two months to think of something and then write it up. Yay :)   I've just come across this  urlLink hilarious blog , written by a 'queer' (as he likes to call it) Asian. He's so clever and witty! And it's not just about being gay, either; he writes about all sorts of crazy things. I feel like I'm promoting him, but it's just mad funny... go read it! Now!

      I've just lived through one of the worst black-outs I've ever known at my house :p 5:30, the power went out. And I was in the shower. Fortunately, I was basically soapless by that point, but the sudden darkness and the blast of cold water from the shower didn't make it seem like heaven, either. I slipped in the tub and now my knee has an awful bruise on it, fell on the floor, thankfully landing on my towel. Now, have you any idea how difficult it is to find a doorknob with no light? I must have spent five minutes simply feeling up the door. I get the door open, realize the towel had fallen while I was fumbling, curse, and swiftly pull the towel back up around my chest again.   I don't  think  anyone saw.   It'd be hard to tell in the darkness anyways. I could just say I dropped my ring; the towel was there the whole time.   Needless to say, I'm rather traumatized at the moment, and because of the black-out, I'm not going to school. Yay. So you'll be getting a few more blogs today, since I'm bored out of my wits and undoubtedly will have more to complain about :)

      And voila! Brilliant, non? I finally gave and trashed the old eremite; now I have a beautiful skin by maystar designs from blogSkins. Love it. Black is my colour, and I am even more pleased than I was a few days ago lol.   Anyways, what's new... my eng. teacher called me on Monday and I have to write one of the two entries for this personal essay/creative writing contest. I'm not even old enough. Anyone have ideas of a theme that involves 'privilege?' Or any idea what a personal essay is?   I'm flattered, obviously, but I'm still flipping out. Very anxious about making everyone proud - I'm a people pleaser, no doubt about that. *sigh* I'll live, no doubt. And I won't be too upset if I don't place, even if that is losing out on $500 to $1000. I don't need the money. I'm not a needy person.

      I don't have a lot of time for a major post, even if I had been planning for something interesting (or at least fun for me to write :p), because a friend of mine got me swept up in  urlLink blogSkins , a site that provides some awesome skins that you can basically just paste into your template editor, and personalize. It's awesome :) So I'm pleased to announce that  urlLink :: genius ::  (as it's now called) is completely rennovated and beautiful! Even if it only was created    what, two, three days ago?   No matter. As I was saying, that's all I have time for, and I probably won't be doing too much posting tomorrow either, due to lots of homework and a piano lesson. Ciao :)

      I am pleased. Once I figure out how to get the two top squares on the sides of the advertisement to be the same colour as the left column, I think I'll even be satisfied. For fear of becoming too much of a geek to face my friends tomorrow at good ol' SCD, I'll stop writing and go watch some T.V. like a normal person.   I hate being normal...

      New blog, nice. This'll be my more personal one, because I have  urlLink another  that's more for just friends to laugh at. So for now, I'll just fiddle around with it until I think it's beautiful :)   EDIT:   It's not as great as I was hoping, but I'll be changing it some more, especially the description in the right-hand corner.    My name, for all intents and purposes, will be ei :) I'll be using cute little pseudonyms for all the people I know, so that hopefully they won't be able to figure out who I am. I'm a bookworm (especially for Neil Gaiman), a musicworm (especially for A Perfect Circle) and a computerworm (Windows XP, lucky, eh?), but other than that I don't really have any defining characteristics. People say I'm very shy - some say malicious - with/to everyone except my friends and family. Then, apparently I'm very funny. I'm not completely positive about that, but I take compliments when I get 'em.   I've always considered myself to be juvenile compared to most of the people I know, both the same age, younger and older than me. I also think I'm naive compared to the rest of the world, and fairly intelligent, compared to that same world.   Life for me right now isn't perfect, but it's not demonically trying to cut me out of the picture, either. Mostly it's dull, which is sometimes even worse than the latter. I'm sure I'll get through this just like I've gotten through what little else in my life there was to traverse :) My biggest fear/problem is that I don't have anyone who I feel truly close to. Sure, I have my supposed 'best friends,' and I'm sure they think I confide in them. I don't. Normally I don't need another person to talk to, but this utter isolation from people who think they know my deepest secrets is really starting to make me twitch.   Anyways, this is all I have time for, and I'll update as often as I can, but I can't promise anything. Ciao :)

      Ok, I know I said to A that I would post no more quizzie results, but god, I am just so flippin proud of this one.... maybe if I think happy thoughts, I'll be able to fly, too...   You are blessed with FAERY wings. Beauty, laughter, life, magic...that's what you are all about. You are refreshingly innocent and happy with your life of purity and play. Life's a game and it's a good one. In your eyes there's no way to lose! You can be very mischeivous and have been known to cause trouble, but it's all in the name of fun and not meant to really harm anyone. You like to play tricks on people who aren't quite as bright or clever as you - which is almost everyone. Nature is the setting you prefer to be in - Always. Barefoot and wild you can't be tamed. You're probably a restless spirit who loves to travel, and quite a dreamer. Your creativity is astounding and your art (of whatever media - from writing to painting to drama) is like something from another world - ethereal and often very fantasy-oriented. You can either be a social butterfly or a loner with their head in the clouds - but rarely inbetween. You stubbornly refuse to accept responsibility or to give in to the wishes of others - unless you feel like it. You have a strong passion for music and can't imagine life without it. You'll grow up someday, but you'll always be a child at heart. You are adventurous and love to take risks, and feel a deep connection with the weather, plants, and animals. You prefer sunshine to thunder or snow, the warmth of summer to autumn's chill, and quiet forests to suburban backyards. Magic through and through, you are far more powerful than you seem, and are capable of being extremely passionate. Though you can be childish, naive, stubborn, and self-absorbed, one thing is certain - life with you will never be boring!   OMG I know this is egotistical but who else thinks that's me? Yayyy I have faery wings! I mean except for the summer > autumn thing (I hate summer; love autumn), that's like... wowie!    I especially like the 'always be a child at heart.' That's very reasurring. I REALLY don't want to grow up.   Might as well post all of them. Nothing better to do...      Playful    urlLink   what's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla         you are woodstock!    urlLink   which peanuts character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla         Heart of Crystal    urlLink   what is your heart  really  made of?     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla         you're fuck.    urlLink   what swear word are you?     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla         You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.  Quite effective; the kiss that never lessens and always blows your partner away like the first time.    urlLink   what kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla      Ok, I'm done. heh.

      New quizzie result!      You're like a fairy. Fairies were the little pixies that usually lived in the forest with wings like butterflies and perfect little faces. they had brown or blonde hair and pale skin with freckles. They were energetic, joyful, playful, very smart, and peaceful. Fairies are definately the most famous of all fantasy creatures.    urlLink   what mystical creature are you?     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla

      Hey hey hey, look at this quizzie:      Your Element is Wind. You're light-hearted, carefree, kind, sensitive, and mysterious. You have friends and most absolutely love you. You can be calm and soothing one minute and raging in anger the next so no one wants to get on your bad side. Your beauty is inspiring and magical.     urlLink   find your element - (girls only)     brought to you by  urlLink quizilla      I think that's pretty reasonable. And it's nice to think my beauty is inspiring and magical. And that no body wants to get on my bad side =D   Among other things, I'm happy. Heh. FFX is absolutely beautiful (my parents are wonderful and finally bought it for me :p); I saw the sending movie part and that was just stunning. I was in shock afterwards. The only thing that bothers me is that I can only save at save-spheres, which is just friggin  annoying . Also the battle system is kinda stupid; not exciting at all, what with the turns. But then again, I can't come up with a better idea, so who am I to judge.   But FFX isn't the only reason I'm happy :) Unfortunately I can't really reveal why I'm so happy here muahaha, just to make everyone get angry at me =D (be forewarned, I am Wind, hear my roar!)   This is also very strange, since for all of you who aren't in my sci. class and didn't witness my total breakdown... well, suffice to say, I'm not a genius. lol. I'm sure you all knew that already, but for me it's kinda disappointing =D =D =D *cracks up* Egotistical maniac! woo!   Thanks P and B for being so nice :) Honestly, I just have the coolest damn friends. Couldn't be happier. Must be a good neighborhood or something :p

      Well. Life isn't fantabulous just yet, but hopefully I'll be getting pancakes tomorrow, so I'm good.   AND! Big news! I finally bought PS2!! Wooo! And my darling parents (hopefully) will be buying me FFX, because I can't afford it right now, since I blew it all on the platform. But I am pleased. I didn't realize it only carried two controllers lol, which sucks, but I have N64 and it's not too hard to switch between the two systems. Not only that, we'll be fixing up a room upstairs with a TV and speakers, so I might just move one upstairs and leave the other in the living room. Wee!   B is going to tell me how to beat it :D   Other news... my hair is evil. I look like a fuzzball right now. It usually works pretty well if I just let it dry, but I'm afraid I'll have to curl it or something (gasp!). Damn hair...   Also, my posters will all be plaqued by this weekend! For all of you who don't understand... I have a few beautiful posters from Stratford (seeing Romeo and Juliet, a few years back), a hugely massive LotR poster (not a movie advertisement, a real work of art), and a little thing I got for Christmas with an essay I wrote on it, and a picture of a pixie. Anyways, they're all gonna be plaqued - meaning, all pretty and glassed up and heavy.   And, that guy who came in and sang songs was soo cool! Hehehe. I wanna do  that  when I grow up, mommy!   Anyways... buh-bye.

      This won't be a long post, since I'm going to sleep in a few minutes (yes, I'm that tired). BUT:   1. I took the Hell test a while ago. I got Level 8, the Maleborge (or something like that). For malicious, fraudulent people and panderers ... don't ask what a panderer is, I don't know either. Go check A's for more details. lol.   2. I took the personality disorder test, and, not surprisingly...        Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    High       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    Moderate       urlLink Antisocial :    Low       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    High       urlLink Narcissistic :    High       urlLink Avoidant :    Moderate       urlLink Dependent :    Low       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Low       --  urlLink take the test  --       I wasn't too surprised. Paranoid, hell yeah. Narcissistic... even more so. Histrionic (like the narcisism)... I could have guessed that one too.   I was surprised this one wasn't higher, considering what I'm like... lol.    Schizotypal  Many believe that schizotypal personality disorder represents mild schizophrenia. The disorder is characterized by odd forms of thinking and perceiving, and individuals with this disorder often seek isolation from others. They sometimes believe to have extra sensory ability or that unrelated events relate to them in some important way. They generally engage in eccentric behavior and have difficulty concentrating for long periods of time. Their speech is often over elaborate and difficult to follow.   Yes? No? Iunno, just when I read that I was like - hey! That's me! :p But whatevah.   And Justice kid, who are ya? loll.

      The way to become boring is to say everything. Voltaire (1694 - 1778)   First, let me just say I love Voltaire. He was one of the most modern, most intelligent and just damn sexiest famous guy from history. Plus, his name is simply awesome. Voltaire. Woo go sci-fi cheesiness!   And, I hope you all had a happy Valentine's. While a prince didn't carry me off into the horizon, I'm not too upset with that, because I'm still wondering how the sun doesn't burn you once you get there.    And , I got this quote at  urlLink Motivational Quotes of the Day . Great site :)   Finally, to get to my original point... how true is this quotation?? I mean come on, this is basically what boredom is. Once everything's been done and said and thought - what left is there to do or say or think? People who constantly explain things when words really can't describe them and the things should just be left alone, are, in essence,  dull ... Not to mention that they bug me.   So maybe this would explain why people fall asleep while scientists are talking; they just explain too much. Leave me life's mystery! I want to continue replying 'magic' to questions and believe it! Not only are people who push back the curtains to show reality boring, they're dream-breakers. And that's just wrong. Dream-breaking should be made illegal. It's as evil as murder, at least; maybe it's worse. I would rather be dead than dreamless.   This has wandered a bit further from where I meant it to go, but I'm fine with that.   Scientists, I think, are all wrong. Or at least, they're going about their business all wrong. Maybe there aren't angels, and maybe there is no heaven in the clouds, but you know what? There is just as much wonder in that! Textbooks don't describe the beauty of it. I think they are stealing our childhood. I think that if society didn't insist on us all facing reality, we'd stay children for the rest of our lives. We'd be able to live in our own Neverland. Think happy thoughts...   Maybe that's what it is - we only age because we lose our innocence. Maybe that's the key to eternal youth - keeping our innocence.   You know, in a past entry I said I was a realist, that I want to face reality, that I  do  face reality. This entry might make me a hypocrite to some, but I still think I'm looking reality right in the eye. My reality, at least. In my reality, fairies still pull my hair.

      OCTOBER: Loves to chat. Loves those who loves them. Loves to takes things at the center. Inner and physical beauty. Lies but doesn't pretend. Gets angry often. Treats friends importantly. Always making friends. Easily hurt but recovers easily. Daydreamer. Opinionated. Does not care of what others think. Emotional. Decisive. Strong clairvoyance. Loves to travel, the arts and literature. Touchy and easily jealous. Concerned. Loves outdoors. Just and fair. Spendthrift. Easily influenced. Easily loses confidence. Loves children.   Find your month  urlLink here  :)   Now before I go on and tear the above description of me to shreds, let me first say HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY! May you not be single and have many children.   *ahem* To proceed... Ok, I'll admit that the above description is actually pretty accurate. Other than the love children. I mean, I love children, but from a distance. A great distance, to be honest. I'd be one of those scary little old ladies who spy on kids with binoculars. I remember someone did that to me once; it was not a nice experience.   Another thing I'm not very happy with is 'always making friends.' I am one of the worst friend-makers I know. Instead of acting friendly and open when I don't know anyone, I usually either go mousy (which is what my spirit is :p) or arrogant and cold. Usually both, actually, if that's possible. I hate strangers.   Most of the other characteristics are true, though; I am extremely opinionated, extremely touchy (though I don't think I show it very often), extremely emotional, one of the best liars I know (heheheheheeheheehee), very easily influenced, and very concerned with the state of the world. And I love the arts, literature, and travel. Though not planes; they scare me. And I love my friends; I like to think I'm very loyal. Maybe I'm clairvoyant, too, who knows? lol. I like the outdoors from inside, and fine, okay, I am easily made jealous... though I try not to let that affect my relationship with the person I'm jealous of. Just and fair? Painfully so. I've hurt a few people's feelings that way, I think. heh.   I am also an infamous daydreamer. This may be partly the reason why I failed that math assignment lol. Damn fairies pulling my hair. I also love chatting... and it's a wonderful thing that October people are beautiful inside and out. I like that :) Go beauty! What I don't understand is 'take things at the center.' What does that mean?? I mean sure, I like centering fonts and all, but I'm getting the feeling that's not what they were referring to.   Either way, it's pretty accurate. Thx A for showing it to me :) (And A, stop complaining about my initializing your names hehehee).   Oh, and for Valentine's Day, my beloved parents gave me: a Mickey Mouse purse and a zillion billion hairbands. Apparently there was a sale. I guess spendthrift-ness is hereditary.

      Wow. Omigod, wow. Ever feel just wow like that? Just like OMIGODWOWWHATANAWESOMEDAY? I mean I usually don't. Especially on shitty days like this one (which I will explain later :p). But just... wow. OMIGODWOW! Just absolute craziness going on right now that I cannot explain except to say I am floating on clouds for no good reason.   Why was today (except for OMIGODWOWWHATANAWESOMEDAY) so shitty? Well! ... I failed my in-class assignment (just like everyone else - except unlike everyone else, if I get below an 80% on the next test I need to get extra help :S). I didn't know there was a history quiz (I still think I passed that though...). And finally, I forgot that the good copy of our St. Donat journal was due in French today. Luckily she didn't collect them, but I was flipping out for a while.   And then I found out from S and DE that my article won't be published in the Eversley Register, because it's offensive to people who go to SAC. I mean what the fuck? It was just my opinion! Stated in a funny, entertaining way, no less! Grr. I'm mad at MD and that stupid Director of Communications. This is censorship in its purest form! We should protest.   Science got me in a better mood though; everyone was just hilarious. Despite the fact P decided to make 'someone else' not sit beside me. Which is just infuriating, because I can't tell P anything about that. Oh well. I'll live.   And then band was fun too, because M was actually there and it was just great. And then I got to hang out with 'someone else' for a little while, which was fun, because he's funny hehehehehe. :p Anyways. I've gotta run kids, people are yelling at me on MSN.

      Hello my darlings, I am deliriously happy today for no other reason except I  am .   If you don't understand what I'm talking about, you don't deserve to be!   On a side note: RE called again. I honestly think he's one of the sweetest musicians I've ever met, even if I'm still skeptical regarding his claim that the flattery is not, in fact, a sales pitch. lol. I wish more people called me =D Even if I don't answer the phone. It makes me feel important.   So, anyways. Deliriously happy for no apparent reason, important and potentially life-altering realizations that I refuse to spill, and now I'm going to run off and leave y'all wondering what the hell I'm talking about :) Sound good? Great. Go to it.

      I love being a stagehand! It is so fun! I get to tell people what to do, when to go onstage, when to come off... I get to see people flip out from anxiety and then come beaming back after a (stunning) performance... I get to tell people to shut up in the dressing rooms...   Man, I think this is my dream job.

      Well. Going to Chris's place was fun, even if he  did  have dead spiders in boxes hanging on his wall ( why  would you do that! why! whyyy!). Also, I finally got the chance to sit in one of those bubble chair things, and I've discovered that they are  not  as comfortable as everyone makes them out to be. I much prefer bean bag chairs. My sister has one. It has her name on it, too. It's very gushy and comfortable, but I think it must be  very  bad for your back, since it like forces you to slouch and stuff...   I've also discovered I don't like those breadstick things that come with pizza. They taste too strong. Nothing needs  that  much damn spice and...  taste . It made my mouth feel funny. Just give me some goddamn baguette!!! *sigh*   What else.... I didn't understand Kung Pow :p Everyone was just cracking up, and I was like hmmm... I think that cow's leg should be broken... I am such an analytical biatch hehe.   Anyways, I guess that's about it. I'm gonna be helping out at a concert tonight, at the Opera House, so that should be fun. I love being backstage there; sooo cool, with the blue lights and all... my only problem is that other than PN I don't know anyone there, which might be a bit awkward :p Ah well. I'll get over it.

      You know what? Feet suck. I hate feet. They're painful and we should just be able to float around without them. Stupid running around putting chairs everywhere >_   Among other things, I've  totally  redone my desktop and it looks sooo damn cool. I have the most awesome wallpaper  ever . Muahaha, I feel special. Unfortunately, this also means that my darling sister is going to kick me off the internet (yes, we share a line, and yes, it sucks, because suddenly she's decided to be a little social butterfly through MSN..) in about ten minutes.   I am drinking three-days-old coke. Now what does that say of me??   C (meaning Chris for now heh), if you've ever checked my blog past that one time you called me a gangsta (I mean what the fuck???) on my tagboard, you have to tell me what movie we're all going to see. Personally, I'd much rather we all just crashed at your house and rented, because my feet hurt and couches are better than movie seats, but whatever. My vote is for From Hell and Resident Evil. Because Johnny Depp is in From Hell and he is damn sexy, and B wants to see Resident Evil for some (blonde) (ditsy) reason =D   She's going to smack me tomorrow.   And who else is going? I say we invite e v e r y b o d y. That will fit in your living room/family room/whichever room's got a T.V. and either a VCR or a DVD player. Just because it's fun with people :) If you can't have too many people in your house, we should all go to Boston Pizza and then go to a movie! Yay! *is lame* lol. Ciao, everyone.

      Wow. Last night I just saw the strangest and most wonderful movie ever:  urlLink Donnie Darko . It was just...  wow . It is so hard to explain! It has that awesome B-movie quality to it, but at the same time they have some big stars like Drew Barrymore acting as well... it was... wow... I'm speechless!   It seems like the kind of movie you have to watch over and over to fully understand, and I completely intend to do so. It was just incredible; easy to see how it became a cult movie. When my b-day rolls around again (yes, a long time from now, but still!), the first person to buy me the DVD version (if it's out yet - we rented the video) gets a froot bat. I'm not sure what it is, except I found it in In Passing, and I like the word. :D   But back to my most amazing movie-watching experience last night: to all of you who like strange, crazy, hard-to-understand but just... wow... then I really recommend Donnie Darko. It is not a chick flick, or an action-packed thriller, but a real thinking / psycho movie that deserves a lot more than some quick-entertainment-seeking viewer.   Honestly, just... wow. Thank you so much B & R! I wouldn't say Donnie Darko is one of my favourite movies (it's just  too  far out for that...), but it was... wow... *wanders off in a daze*

      Hey hey, look who's back.   Yeah, well, sorry for not posting over March break. You know how it is. Too stuffed with chips and cookies to move past the T.V. remote. So anyways, I've been back for a few days, and all that ignorant bliss of MB has already been pushed away by the miserable cruelty of high school.   *sigh*   I think I'm in one of my pissy-weeks, too. I am in an unusually bad mood, for no good reason at all. I just feel like it ^^; PMS? Maybe. *g* But it seems to occur a few times a year, especially in the winter, after Christmas and March break. Maybe I'm one of those mood-swingy people, unpredictable and rowdy.   Abruptly changing the topic, I want an 'I'm with Stupid' t-shirt. With the arrow and all.   I don't particularly have any more to say, except that my fingers are tired and I feel very... weak. Au revoir, a bientot and... yeah. Look out behind you.

      Now, since I'm a loser, of course I haven't done anything this March break ~v~ I haven't even gone to a movie yet. My sister's been shopping every day since the year 1000 (in other words, since we got out) and here I am, sitting at home, being a loser. And, true to my loser-esque ways... an awesomely cool artist/writer (go check out her friends' work too, omgomgomg! I've already got 3 new wallpapers lol)    urlLink www.meadowhaven.net    Now, since I'm bored and really have nothing further to say that I'd like to post on my blog... I'm off to watch Mickey Blue Eyes. hehe. Hugh Grant may be cheesy and a bad actor, but guys with British accents are always funny, no matter what they say.

      Ever feel like you are just bursting to the brim with something to say or do or think, and you honestly think this creative genius is just going to spill out of your ears if you don't make/play/write/draw/whatever soon? And then you can't? For whatever reason? I mean like.... ahhhhh! It is extremely and painfully aggravating. I hate this. *growls*   I should go play the piano, but it's too late now. And I have nothing to write about. And I don't like my flute. And I tried sketching out some more anime, but that didn't help. *sigh* At least my sketchbook is getting nice and full... what other forms of art are there?   Dance!   *does crazy John Peter Louis dance to Lateralus*   *is tired*    Some time later....  okay, so that helped a little bit. But I am going stir-crazy!!! Really! Silvery art-juice is going to run out of my ears if I don't get rid of it. This is insanely uncomfortable. Now I won't be able to sleep, I won't be able to sit still for any length of time, won't be able to work... I need to scream. Or at least do some mind-numbing activity so that I stop thinking and die or whatever.    Who here believes in an afterlife? I'm not sure if I do. If I did, I'd believe in reincarnation, since I do believe that we're here to learn. Obviously you can't learn everything in one lifetime, so you'd come back... or, your spirit would move on. Because I just don't see how, if you are to learn things, you forget everything when you return in your next life. Of course, maybe we progress to some creature that can't express itself like that... or maybe, I'm just not advanced enough to know.    I'm a Mahalayan Buddhist, btw. That's what the Belief-o-Matic told me. And then a Universalism thing, and then a neo-pagan. I emailed myself a copy of the results :) I love religions! I loathe close-minded people who think their religion is the one true way though. My old best friend was like that *sigh* It was depressing. I remember we got into a massively huge fight because she said my parents didn't know between right from wrong. And I know none of you will believe me lol, but I hadn't said anything personal like that to her! Just that I believed something else. Nothing about her family.    I do remember that I gloated after she got into trouble though. hehehe.   Anyone think religion is a good thing? I think belief is, and faith is, but that religion isn't. I haven't entirely worked out clear distinctions between the three, but I know there are subtle differences. I just haven't figured them out yet. I will eventually.   I've also decided that I'm a hippie =D I'm going to hitchhike across Canada with my harp and show how treehugging-ness is the world's salvation! Hell, maybe I should be the next Jesus or something...   *falls off chair*   I sure as hell hope none of you are strict Christians. hehehehehe...

      This week seems to be the Week of Short Blogs. Because I honestly don't have too much to say, other than that I love the weather, A is  finally  15 now, and today was rather boring.   And damn right I love the weather! Mud and rain and grey skies are what I live for!! April and March, best months of the year. This is when everything is growing and wet and alive!! Spring is my favourite season. And fall. And winter. And... man, I love every season as they come. It's great to be me, non? hehe. The only problem is that this seems to be roadkill season, too >_    *wipes away tears* Anyways, today was boring, because everyone seemed to busy to talk to me!! Plus I wasn't in my usual hyper-happy mood, so people kept giving me funny looks since I wasn't being crazy ^^ I mean jeez, can't a girl be  depressed  for once? ~v~ ~v~ The Curse of Caleigh: people automatically think you're considering suicide if you are not bouncing off the walls and grinning so hard your face is coming unscrewed.   Hehehe, I think I've just used my whine-points for the next thousand years or so.    Have I ever said I love A Perfect Circle? God, I love them. *huggles* They're just... wowie! They're like ei-music. That should be a new genre. A Perfect Circle is the epitome of ei-music, btw. All others who wish to become ei-music should look to A Perfect Circle for A Perfect Example.   *dies*   I'm sorry. I'm bored and I feel very unloved, unlike A, who is very loved ~v~ Happy 15th and we love ya, babes! (Babes, as in, young and naive and helpless ^o^ don't kill me!)   And, despite the fact I need to look up most of em in that awesome site A gave me, I love using anime smilies, at least in my blog. They're just soooo damn cool.   Movie, anyone? Tomorrow night?

And invite us to the cast part-ay, dammit!!   Oh yeah - if any of you understand how to find the average speed of a mid-latitude pressure system over the past 24 hours... call me. Please. Because I fucking don't. And that annoys me to no end.   So anyways, ciao guys, see ya'll at choir. Man, I'm talking like an American now. Damn commies.

      Hey guess what! Today I'm going to actually post, instead of just brag about how well I can manipulate quizzies.   Weell... I am terribly excited, for no reason except for that which I will neeever eeeever tell! ^_~ don't ya'll hate me?   Oh, and I've decided to challenge myself... I will now use those funky anime smileys from now on. They just seem cooler and more interesting and pretty. ^_^ Yay! Don't you think they're cool? Hmm... for all of you who don't understand those (and if you don't, you're a loser, I'm terribly sorry but anyone who spends any amount of time on the computer should know...)... here is a translation!   BTW, I'm sure there are more, except I don't know em. This is probably just a phase anyways, because it takes too long for me to find the ^ key, but whatevah.   In fact, I'm positive there are more, because I only know three :) err... I mean... ^___^ heh.   ^__^ = smile / equivalent to :p >__ ^__~ = you're not stupid.   Anyways, other than my almost-reasonless excitement, life is just okay. School bugs me. And I think everyone shoulda skipped choir this morning. And I'm tired. But that's ok! Because it's gonna rain today, and I love rain ^__^

      No. *g* Except for a cute Frodo and funny A, M & B, it was painfully boring. That stupid Snakes song! It's ridiculous! And the conductor for that piece bugged the hell out of me, too. Something about him was just... spooky... -.- Creed wouldn't be that bad, except for the fact that  we played it all of last year ... like come on!! *sigh* The conductor for that piece wasn't too bad though. She reminded me of the woman from 'Murder, She Wrote.' You know, that old mystery TV show?   UCC was pretty cool. Not as vine-y and old-looking as I thought it would be, but it seemed very athletics-based which is always nice to see. *gag* lol. It was also cool because that's where my dad went for his last few years of highschool. Was looking at the pictures on the wall to see if he was in any of them ^^; I didn't see him though. But he looked different then. He even had long hair!! Ahhh!!   And on the bus ride back... well, let's just say I was ready to kill D&S. They kept getting closer and closer and closer... I can take them from a distance, but once they're in my lap.. eww! No! No! No! I was getting very claustrophobic >   The comp. sci. test went well, I still don't have a debate partner for next week, I'm mad that I missed a grub day, and the cello guy was cute. And I'm done!

      Okay I'm bored. See, I had that massively huge comp.sci. assignment, right? And I was planning to stay after school on Monday (as in, today) to finish it, yes? Stupid Mr M let us work on it in class, and so I finished it there, and now I've got nothing to do! So A and I are practically instant messaging (is that even a word..) each other through gMail (it rocks, BTW -- soo fast and coolio-looking), and I'm reading m0Do's  urlLink Eternal Journal , the coolioest thing since sliced bread. I'll make a separate article on that later. Maybe later today, since I am dyyying of boooredom...   Frodo makes me sad. He's always alone, but he's a great guy. Why doesn't he want friends?

      Yayy I am soo finished the Civics homework! All that is left is the VB part of the comp.sci. assignment, but since I don't have anything remotely resembling VB here at home, I'll do it tomorrow after school. Yayy! I am pleased. Except I hate my printer. It took two flipping hours to print everything. I mean wtf?! It's just absolute insanity. Except me da keeps saying the only way it works properly is if you're nice to it. So next time I'll try that. Yelling at it seems to be futile, soo...   I might like technology, but it sure as hell hates me o_O

      Being a blogger at blog*spot, I had the wonderful opportunity to try out gmail (Google's new free email service)! So, being a technical adventurer, I of course signed up. Only after A tried it out first though ^^; (*G*G*G*G*) Anyways, turns out it's awesome and pretty and easy, unlike hotmail, soo... new email! Of course I'll still use  urlLink feuxfollet16@hotmail.com , because it's easier to remember and the 'normal' email, but this one is just cooler and more interesting...   So, here it is:  urlLink ei.thrd3ey@gmail.com

      Surprisingly enough, layout was fun! I actually enjoyed setting up pages -- and being speedy quick and a genius (*ahem*), I got 5 pages done. Which is pretty cool, considering it took the layout team days and days to get as far as we did in just a few hours. So anyways, hopefully my @#$%!! piece will get published ^^; I toned down a few parts, made my point a bit more subtle in others, and niced it up for all the baby niners... so, hopefully the admin. will be pleased. I also handed in my resume and cover letter... ack! I might end up being Newspaper Editor next year o_O Personally, I think I'm far too immature, but the Doc asked me to at least send in the resume, so whatevah. If I do get chosen, I sure as hell won't be as docile as SC was this year. Spunk! Pizzaz! Life! No more of this 'can't offend the SAC school'-ness!   Not that I have a choice, of course.   Also nice is that I practically finished my comp. sci. assignment. I'm staying after school on Monday to do the VB part, but after that I'm homefree. Yayy! All that's left are those damn Civ. research pieces... *sigh* I'm avoiding it. But tomorrow I'll wake up at 8:00 and get to it. Mr Y will not be displeased! ^^;   And finally, for your amusement...          From  urlLink The Jongleur .

      Both Thank God It's Friday and Thank God I'm Female. Tomorrow I've got to be at the school by 10:00 for lay-out; I'm still not sure if I have to wear my uniform or not. I've also got to start working on those 10 research entries due Monday for Civics... ack! I haven't even started o_O Little ol' procrastinating me. That's okay though. I got four done in two hours... that means 10 done in five. Not that much of a sacrifice. Plus I don't need paragraph-long ideas for each one ^^;   And! Thank God I'm Female ^^; For all of you who are clever enough to figure out who PB is (although if you write his name anywhere on this site or yours I'll take ya to the knacker's (thank you Mrs W!)), he is just insanely hot right now. *sigh* I have bad taste in guys, I know. But he's  so  hot! How can you resist such hotness? Aiee!! *goes insane* It's just absolute craziness. And he doesn't even really fit my 'perfect guy' forward! Just shows to go ya that those things never turn out the way you want them to.   Mmmmmmm though seksyseksyseksy ^^;    *falls off chair*   I'm all alone right now, which always scares me just a little bit. This house is too big for just one person. Honestly, when I own a house of my own, it will be tiny cottage-sized way out in the country. I don't actually know what sort of career other than park ranger lends itself to that sort of lifestyle, but that's just kind of like my dream situation. I could probably deal with an apartment near a nice park. Just not way in a city with all the smog and materialism. ^^; I am slightly (*ahem* another understatement of the year) finicky when it comes to those things.   I am a hippie, really, I am. Just a  high-tech  one. And that doesn't mean I'm always on acid, either, despite what Mr M believes. SohCahToa! That's what it is, right?   Oh, and for all who are wondering: A's s/n "the people at kinko's can" is a reference to my hilariously not funny joke made in Boston. Ask for further details. C and A won't shut up about it, sooo... ah, well. I don't mind flattery too much.   Now, excuse me while I see if I have any accidental shots of PB in my pictures from Boston... ^^;;;;;;;; *g*

      Well, I'm in Civics. Technically, I should be working on the pamphlet, but I am troubled and need some consolation. See, M is suddenly acting very cold and ignoring me. And while I've gotten used to her little funks where she's just a bit mad at me for whatever reason (I've never actually talked to her about it before) because she normally grows out of it in one or two days, but wowie, it's a lot worse this time. Normally I wouldn't care, because she's not my only friend and as long as we don't go hating each other I don't mind not being stuck together at the hip, but M happens to be right in the middle of our little social group with me, and if she suddenly gets mad at me I don't want everyone to be dragged into sides...   So if someone knows what's going on (if anything), please tell me... so I can either ask her about it or fix what I'm doing wrong... Iunno. If there is something going on, it was bound to happen -- we are at the opposite extremes. Hippie v. shopaholic. ^^; oooh, the drama of high school... Gah. I was hoping that wouldn't happen here. This kind of thing only happens to my sister o_O

      Well, the simplest definition of chaos is the possibility that entirely random answers can be had from a normal equation. The chaos theory is basically that disorder can come from order, AND that order can come from disorder. Seemingly entirely random, too. This sudden appearance comes from tiny, tiny tinytinytiny differences in data: a difference of 0.00000000000000001 will, eventually, entirely change the outcome of the equation. Hence the Butterfly Effect: the flap of a butterfly's wing could, potentially, cause or prevent some massive hurricane elsewhere in the world. A near-invisible change in conditions will cause huge differences in later results.    Of course this means that no experiment, of course, is entirely controlled, and that experiment results can always, potentially, be entirely off. You can't control everything in a lab, no matter how hard you try. Everything has some sort of effect on the experiment. Which is bad. Because now we can never be sure if the results were because of some random background noise, or because the cold honestly killed off all the chickens.   Apparently this is called sensitive dependence on initial conditions.   And this takes us into all sorts of other things. If you happen to be absolutely fascinated with how one tiny thing can change the world, you can visit  urlLink Chaos Theory: A Brief Introduction  for tons more information. Or just type 'the chaos theory' into  urlLink Google . So anyways, that's it. Just thought I'd share it with everyone... ^^;   Seeing as I'm weird and all o_O

      Entropy, how can I explain it? I'll take it frame by frame it, to have you all jumping, shouting saying it. Let's just say that it's a measure of disorder, in a system that is closed, like with a border. It's sorta, like a, well a measurement of randomness, proposed in 1850 by a German, but wait I digress. "What the **** is entropy?", I hear the people still exclaiming, it seems I gotta start the explaining.   You ever drop an egg and on the floor you see it break? You go and get a mop so you can clean up your mistake. But did you ever stop to ponder why we know it's true, if you drop a broken egg you will not get an egg that's new.   That's entropy or E-N-T-R-O to the P to the Y, the reason why the sun will one day all burn out and die. Order from disorder is a scientific rarity, allow me to explain it with a little bit more clarity. Did I say rarity? I meant impossibility, at least in a closed system there will always be more entropy. That's entropy and I hope that you're all down with it, if you are here's your membership.   Chorus  You down with entropy? Yeah, you know me! (x3) Who's down with entropy? Every last homey!   Verse 2  Defining entropy as disorder's not complete, 'cause disorder as a definition doesn't cover heat. So my first definition I would now like to withdraw, and offer one that fits thermodynamics second law. First we need to understand that entropy is energy, energy that can't be used to state it more specifically. In a closed system entropy always goes up, that's the second law, now you know what's up.   You can't win, you can't break even, you can't leave the game, 'cause entropy will take it all 'though it seems a shame. The second law, as we now know, is quite clear to state, that entropy must increase and not dissipate.   The second law is quite precise about where it applies, only in a closed system must the entropy count rise. The earth's not a closed system' it's powered by the sun,   That, in a nutshell, is what entropy's about, you're now down with a discount.

      Hmm... where to start, where to start... how about at the beginning? ^^; heeheeheheehe..   Well, the bus ride there was insane.  Someone  (on the student's council, no less!) was around 40 minutes late, so we had to wait for her. And then on the niner's bus someone forgot their uniform, and someone  else  forgot their passport, so apparently they were waiting for that, too. I was flipping out because I really, really didn't want to miss the Blue Man Group ^_^   Other than those few mishaps and a couple of god-awful traffic jams, the bus ride went pretty smooth. Watched a few movies, learned a few card games, sang a few songs, ate more than a few McDonald's fries and in general had a pretty good time. I've never seen Niagara Falls, and that was just incredible. And when we stopped, we wandered outside, which was nice -- I miss being outside ~v~ My computer tends to distract me, I'm afraid.   In the end, though, rather than going to the hotel for an hour to freshen up and such before the show, we just went straight to it.   And then... Oh. My. God. Oh my God!! Aiee!! That was the most incredible show I've ever seen in my life. I won't write what happens in the finale, in case you haven't seen it, but jumping jungle-cats, Batman... WOWIE. Unlike what some people thought (muahaha, I knew better), it wasn't a jazz show at all. Pure percussion. With funky neon glow-in-the-dark paint. And blue men. And absolute hilarity! You all know how I go on and on about Maynard and his bands A Perfect Circle and Tool... well, this show was like Tool personified. One of the things I love so much about Tool is the awesomely-fantasmical percussion, the really, really interesting sounds and music that you just don't hear in typical pop and emo and rock. Aiee!!   After that we just went back on the bus to check in at the hotel. Since the hotel wasn't even actually in Boston, that took a while more in the bus, but it was fun -- GA brought his guitar ( such  a good idea!), and a bunch of guys played and sang and it was just awesome. Guitars are cool. Guys who sing are cooler.   The hotel was surprisingly nice; really, really good pillows. Better than my pillows at home ^^; Had a nice sleep. Breakfast in the morning was good, too -- scrambled eggs, yadda yadda yadda, the usual.   Unfortunately, on the actual tour, I forgot my camera *doh* But Quincey Market was lots of fun, and the Aquarium was craziness, and I bought a squishy penguin and a necklace for my mum. The only downside was being dragged around by my darling roomies to shop at Victoria's Secret and AE and blah blah blah.. I dislike shopping intensely. Fortunately I soon convinced almost all of them (M ditched us to shop more ^^;) that the guys were having more fun interviewing and recording Americans on what is Manifest Destiny, do you think Canada should be the next American state, etc. etc. etc., so the day wasn't a complete loss ^^; Harvard was pretty cool too, though very ugly. McGill is way prettier.   There was also this awesome zapper game that I am just soo angry I didn't buy!! I totally beat everyone at it, and then I forgot to ask where JB got it from, and arrrgh!! Blech. Oh well ^^;   Also, Boston sundaes are good. Very, very, very good. And those mouse rugs were too cool for words (mouse pads, but ORIENTAL CARPETS with the little fringes and everything!!).   The gameshow thing at the hotel was the most boring, most lame and most utterly disappointing show ever. Ugh. I died that night ^^; Was pretty angry afterwards, seeing as we had to leave early right when the dance started because we had to compete the next day... *sigh*   The competition went really well. Lots of fun. Our bands didn't do as well as we hoped (silver all). But the choir got gold, and was first overall in the competition -- we're invited to Salt Lake City to sing with Mormons or something.. (???) Anyways, I got lots of great pictures, and it was insanely fun, and all that jazz.   The Salem witch museum wasn't that great, but hey, whatever. A got a mini Tarot card set, which was pretty cool. She was doing readings for everyone in our room (we had a mini-party, wee!) later that night.   The dance was fun too. I actually thought the music was better than normal; they played way more oldies than most. And everyone knows the oldies are the best songs. Of course the award ceremony beforehand was painfully boring. Those Americans have too much patriotism. I'm not quite sure if I got a pic of me in my nice clothes and all, but I did get one of everyone else, so. I know what I look like; doesn't matter too much ^^;   So yeah, we had fun in the hotel room afterwards, and then we went to sleep. Really nice pillows. Loved 'em.   Got up early the next day, had breakfast, got into the bus and soon were on our way. Poor P had to sit up way in the front *g* Played more cards, listened to more music, watched more movies. Wasn't that bad. And then we realized that the niner bus had disappeared. Yup, that's right. They ended up being 3 hours behind us. Called my mum on M's cell, fortunately, so instead of waiting outside for my sis to get there I just sat in the car and gushed about blue men... but still.   And now there is today. I'm skipping school, thank God, because I am so tired. And the Sens won last night (THAT'S RIGHT YOU FLEA-LOVIN RAGGAMUFFINS! GO OTTAWAAAAA!!). And I ended up going to bed at like 11:30, and I woke up at 12:30 (and only then because N was singing in the damn shower.. grr...). So, all in all, I don't really think the two measly days in Boston were worse the 10+ hours bus ride, the Blue Man Group made it all work out. Wow. They better come to Toronto soon ^^;   ...   READY GO   (8) I think I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese I really think so...

      *~For girls to answer only~*~     1-Flowers or candy?  flowers     2-What kind of flowers?  any ^^;     3-Romantic dinner or Amusement Park date?  ooh.. entirely depends on how well I know him. Romantic dinner for a serious boyfriend, but an amusement park for first- or second-time dates.     4-A long walk or the movies?  Both!     5-The phone or in person?  In person, always. Hate phones.     6-Handwritten letters or e-mails?  Either ^^;     7-First Date Kiss?  NO! Someone who is that forward is just... ick!     8-Outdoors guy or sporty?  Outdoors, totally. I like musicians, but quietness is always iffy and tree-huggers rock my world.     9-Piercings on guys?  sure!     10-Hat or no hat?  Depends     11-Glasses or not?  No glasses     12-Is religion important?  Definitely. I want someone who knows what he believes, accepts and welcomes others' ideas, is willing to talk about religion / other controversial things with me, is very spiritual and cares.     13-Serious or funny?  Ooh.. funny, but understanding. Understanding is essential.     14-Do smarts matter?  Umm... yes. Stupid people bug me. Deep thought and conversation is a must. But not always serious. Someone who can appreciate The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy! Grades aren't important, but Cleverness is, and wit, too. It's also better if he's not a teacher's pet.     15-A guy to hold you or a guy to laugh with?   Laugh with     16-Tan or light?  Hmm... depends.     17-Spontaneous or predictable?   Spontaneous ideas, predictable personality.     18-Describe the perfect date:  Out for an evening walk in the springtime, wandering the streets together, eventually going to a cafe for a quick snacky-dinner. Feeding ducks in a pond!     20-Describe the perfect guy:  Tall, and if not muscular, not skinny, either. I like thickness and coziness and bigness, so that when he hugs me it feels like I'm all wrapped up. Dark, long-ish curly/shaggy hair, quick eyes and sharp nose, easy-to-laugh mouth with pointy teeth ^^; (don't ask *g*) Funny and reasonably obnoxious in groups and with friends, but when it comes to romance, a bit shy and awkward. Still brave enough to make a move though! Loyalty is key. So is independence -- he's all for my 'depending on substances is evil' opinion. Musical, poetic, intelligent but not brainy. Likes games and medieval-y things like me ^^; Has a good sense of humour, slightly irresponsible, in love with nature just like me, realizes I'd give my life for my dog rather than him, and willing to sacrifice everything for something he believes in. Passionate and understanding, edgy and friendly. I'm sure he's out there somewhere. Probably not human, though.

      After yesterday's somewhat-depressing post, I figured I'd better kick it up a notch, so as not to jinx the trip ^^; So! I am going to describe various people, and see if you can guess who they are!   1. Always just a little bit confused, very tough and could probably beat up me and a number of other people despite her small size. Constantly worrying unneccessarily over her weight, an exercise fanatic and likes eating noodles and salads. Obsesses over Armani.   2. Very imaginative and absolutely hilarious over MSN and through writing, but painfully shy and quiet in person. Absolutely insane ideas that almost always work, and knows more about old languages than Tolkien. Has probably fallen off the sacred cloud one too many times.   3. Craziest fashion sense I've ever come across. 'Baby punk,' if there ever was one, except she worries more over school and hair than is appropriate. She can too sing, despite her protestations, and that damn pumpkin doesn't know what she's talking about.   4. Another 'baby punk.' Could probably create a better and safer CN Tower with normal household objects. I'm in the process of re-decorating her bag. She'll also probably be the first female lead in an emo band. Or the next Santana.   5. Psycho girl who can act damn well.   6. Umm... I need more good friends ^^;   *g* Actually I can think of more, except I'm tired and the game's on and I'm bored. So, ^^;, have fun! Not too hard to figure out, but that was the point, mostly.

      I am happy happy happy. Good results on a math test, confident about the science quiz, going to Boston in two days and tomorrow's a Day 3!! So, therefore, I am pleased.    ... Edit...    However, after a very troubling piano lesson, I've got some unpleasant questions....... T.T   Why do kids die? Adults, they've lived their life, they've done it all, they've had a chance to make the world a better place, they're no longer innocent and they've lived it up. Kids haven't. It's painfully unfair to the kid, and almost, even more to the parents. If there is some sort of God up there, why would he let that happen? How could he let a child feel more pain than any human being deserves to feel, die before he/she has had the chance to experience life, or live their life in a hospital? How could he deny anyone these basic human rights, these necessities? How could he not let a person fall in love?   I like to think that Earth is as much heaven as we're ever going to get, that we can and will make it here ourselves, that it's our decision and our responsibility to make this place 'paradise.' That, in fact, it's the very imperfections that make this world so precious. But the way things have been going lately, in fact, the way things have been going for as long as humans remember... I'm getting serious doubts. We may be able to stop war, curb hatred, re-teach the generations that everyone is equal and worthy of love, but who will cure the little girl with leukemia, or the boy with AIDS? Everyone has to die, I'm all for it, it's the way Earth balances itself, if people ever stopped dying, it'd be The End.   Sometimes I just wonder about the way and the how of it, though.

      Easter was insanely fun. I've decided I do like children; only boys, though. Little girls get on my nerves. But two of my uncles brought girlfriends, and one of the girlfriends had to kids -- two boys, 11 and either 4 1/2 or 6. We're not actually sure how old this kid is; he says he's 4 and a half, but his mom said she had the kid when she was 38, and now she's 44... so anyways. Someone is lying ^^;;   So anyways, here's what I've decided: when we're all old and in our own houses, we all have to buy some big house and go there all together for the holidays. Families and everything. It is just soo much fun to have so many people together! I mean, it's craziness, but it is sooo fun! This year 19 (or something like that) people came over, and the only hard part is having to clean up when they're all gone.   Also, I am slightly bloated on chocolate. And my tummy hurts not because of candy, but because A is hilarious and I love her very very much. What would we do without our crazy musical A? I'm actually talking about both of them; A is back from Scotland and A wrote a WOWIE-hilarious blog earlier today. Either way, I am immensely pleased. Life is good.   I had my pia-no lesson today, and it was fun and interesting. My exam (aiee!) is on June 29th, long after our school exams, but still, I'm worried. Strangely enough I'm not actually worried enough to  practice , but that's fine. I'm sure I'll get bonus marks for grovelling. Nah, actually, I'm just a terrible procrastinator. Just watch, by June 28th my fingers will be stumps.   What else, what else... basically nothing. But I'm still looking for that fifth mini-site. I really, really want to add in a fifth link there *g* So if somebody doesn't comment / do the poll / call me / mail me / write it with lipstick on my mirror, I am going to go in some maniacal kill-all frenzy and you'll all be sorry. Or maybe I will anyways, muahaha.. ^^; I jest, I jest! Relax. Don't fall off your chair, jeez, it makes you look immature and dorky... man, you guys...   *falls off chair*

      For some strange reason my champagne post disappeared. No idea why. I think Blogger is haunted by evil blogger spirits. So anyways, here's what the important things were:   1. I complained about champagne / alcohol. 2. I admitted that champagne had very useful bubbly symbolism, and that's why we should bring it out to celebrate because... 3. My website is finished! And 4. The 3 links are up underneath e i 3 3 t H i r d E Y e.    And the unimportant things:   1. My Grandma is coming over. 2. Styling stuff for hair never works. 3. My Easter bunny nibbles. 4. The Goonies is now one of my favourite movies. 5. I'm going crazy when I grow up. 6. I see things that aren't there. (^^;)   And the insanely important thing that you should all know by now and be gasping in awe at:   #1 :::::::::::::: MY HAIR IS CUT AND IT IS SHORT AND BOUNCY. WOO.   Okay. So that's done. I am now going to randomly ramble about my problems with the abridged version of The Princess Bride.     My first problem is WHO WROTE IT. Apparently the 'original' was written by S. Morgenstern but the book is also claiming that Florin and Guilder are  real countries  and that The Princess Bride actually happened! Now okay, I'm skeptical about the whole Florin and Guilder thing, but I mean the guy who abridged it (Goldman) has all these inserts and he honestly talks about Morgenstern like the man existed! And apparently Morgenstern was Florinese and the entire book was written in Florin at first and it's actually a massively huge satire making fun of Florinese nobles. Ahhh!   And you know how at the beginning of books they have quotations from various critics? Well one of the critics is this professor of 'Florinese History'!!!  FLORIN DOESN'T EXIST!  How can it have a historian! But then Goldman is also talking about how, if you go down some street or another in Florin, you can reach the Morgenstern Museum. Oh. My. God. NO! !@#$  There is no Florin!    But they all talk about it so seriously that I'm thinking... well, mayyybe... But no! It's impossible!   And listen to this: Goldman says that  STEPHEN KING WROTE ABRIDGED VERSION OF THE SEQUEL!!!!  No way. No way no way no way. King is a great horror writer, sure, but no way would anybody who liked Morgenstern let King write it. But Goldman is honestly claiming that King wrote it and now I am entirely confused. Because nowhere does it say that this didn't happen! This is insane!!   I mean, as a discordian, I take a bit of pleasure from being bamboozled. But jeepers creepers, it is absolute madness. At least in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I knew it was fake. Here it's like... the twilight zone...   Sorry about that. But I needed to clear my thoughts. ^^;;;

      So's anyways, I woke up this morning and went downstairs expecting chocolate rabbits and pretty eggs, yeah? And so like there I was, standing at the table looking for my loot, and I get this tap on the shoulder. So's I turn around, and nobody's there. I start to go back to searching the table, and I hear this little gurgly *ahem* from behind me. So's I turn around again, look down, and whaddaya know! It's this little white rabbit dude with red eyes. You know the one from the Cadbury (that's its name, right?) commercials, hiding under that kid's bed?   Love 'em.   So there I were, just standing there, facing this little white rabbit dude. I almost can't believe my eyes, yeah? It's like.. whoa.... and then! Get this!! I couldn't believe my frickin eyes when I saw this one, make sure you're sitting down, guys. And  then   the little white rabbit dude  hopped !!!   ...   AND THEN HE SPOKE!!!   "You don't really expect any chocolate, do you?" the white rabbit dude said in this posh, English-y accent. And I'm like, dude, yeah, it's Easter, you know? And then he's like Santa hasn't brought you anything for years. Why should I give you candy when he doesn't?   I just stand there staring at him, yeah? Looking like, what the hell are you talking about, yeah? All angry and stuff. "If Santa hasn't been giving me presents, then what were all those books  from Santa  under the tree last year?"   Then the little white rabbit dude laughed. I was just about ready to slam the creep into the wall, but the red eyes scared me, yeah? So's anyway, the dude was like, that wasn't from  Santa ! That was from  me!    Okay so like by this time I'm totally freaked. Here's this little fluffball with ears saying that Santa hates me or doesn't exist or somethin  and  that I don't got no Easter loot! I mean like what's the world coming to! If we don't get junk every long weekend, what the hell are we here  for ? Human beings are consumers, yeah?, but without those frickin rabbits and fat dudes we don't have a damn thing to consume!!   And then! Get this!! I couldn't believe my frickin eyes when I saw this one, make sure you're sitting down, guys. And  then   the little white rabbit dude  hopped !!!   ...   AND THEN HE LAUGHED MANIACALLY LIKE DR. EVIL AND SAID, LIKE, HE WAS GONNA KILL ME AND ALL THAT STUFF 'CAUSE I KNEW TOO MUCH!!!   ...   Okay so's that's when I slammed him into the wall and now I've gotta clean up this mess 'fore the rents come down, yeah?   Happy Easter for real, guys. *g*

      Hello my darlings! I am terribly sorry I had to vanish like that on you, but unfortunately my tummy was very adamant. I think it was a mix of PMS and too many drugs. Not illegal drugs, don't worry. I'm not that depressed yet. But damnnn... that was painful T.T   So now, I am working on my mini-project (website! yay!), and trying to finish enough of it so I can post up the links and be all happy... HOWEVER. J'ai une probleme. I need another idea for a mini-site. See, I have this amazingly cool set-up for the homepage (i-frames and everything! aw ya!), but for it to look really, REALLY cool, I need 5 links. Not 4. So... any ideas?   Heeheeheehee... and btw -- how did the performance go? I bet ya sounded better without me lol.   A few more things... I'll probably be at school tomorrow, I'm getting my hair cut (YAA), and happy Easter! Oh, and I love Maynard.   Have I said that already? ^^;;;;;;

      How is everyone this fine day? I am in an unusually bad mood still, because of various things I won't be going into due to other various things... ^^;   One thing though: extremely happy that I got the Underworld soundtrack! Yaa! Four songs featuring May-b0y, and lots of others that are just wowie. I am terribly pleased, to say the least. I have discovered an entire new genre of music that is just  perfect  -- apparently A Perfect Circle / Tool aren't the only bands who are awesome!! *woo* Be happy for me ^^;   Apparently industrial metal is what my ears were designed for or something. Iunno. I just know that it's fucking awesome. Pardon my english. o_O *is lame*   So that's all for now, folks, tune in next blog.

      I changed it. The whole 'eremite' thing started to bore me; besides, I felt like tweaking. So voila, you have a somewhat-changed original Blogger template. It's strange; I just don't like using the Blog Skins stuff. Doesn't feel original enough or something. Despite the fact that I can't write HTML for beans.   ei33tHirdEYe... randomness. ei, of course, you all know. CalEIgh. Rather than ie. *g* Thanks to Nith for that wonderful invention that I still use... wow, that was a long time ago. I don't even talk to him any more. It's quite sad. 3 is my favourite number, but I like 2, too, so it's a double-3. Rather than 6. Because I am against math and all that it represents. Logic sucks, and so do most numbers except for 2 and 3. Third Eye is a song by Tool, which is one of my favourite bands, and it is a damn cool song at that. Also, it means so many wonderful things -- and it looks cool. So, for the symbolism, prettiness and the fact that it proves I worship Maynard James Keenan... it, too, is stuck into the name.   The capitalisation of H, E, and Y is just for prettiness. But it also spells 'hey.' I'm not quite sure of the relevance of that, but since I only realized it when I typed "H, E, and Y", I figure it's gotta mean something. I am a firm believer in signs and omens. Weird things don't just happen to be weird, they happen so that we look twice at life before jumping to conclusions.   Anyways, I hope all of you are having a much more exciting weekend than I. Also, it's too bad, A, but I found the Ontario Ren Faire site, and it turns out to 'be entertainment' you have to send in an audition tape... like, 3 months ago. o_O So that's no fun. I won't be playing anything at the Ren Faire.    But we can go anyway!!

      And so it is Friday. TG. I don't actually have that much to say, but I figured I'd let ya'll know I'm alive. Or at least, that my fingers are.   I'm scared all the time. Is that normal, or does that just make me paranoid? I wouldn't mind being paranoid. I'm already planning on living out in the boonies all by myself. With my dog. So not all by myself, because I'll have a dog, but enough by-selfness that it'll finally be    SILENT.   People never know when to shut up.

      So it's comp sci again. We just played jeopardy; 'twas fun. I'm very very sorry that I didn't write yesterday, except I was reading my book ( Windhaven , by George R R Martin and someone else, now finished) and just in general being a slob.   I did very well on my civics. This is good, because I like civics and I want to do well in that course. I think it's terribly fascinating. Maybe I'll be the next equivalent to Trudeau or something ^^; That'd be fun.   I hope everyone here hates Stephen Harper. If you don't hate that redneck leader of Conservatives you're not allowed here ^^; hee, no, I'll just be relatively icy cold to ya up until the election. Then, when the Liberals blow the Conservatives away, I'll be nice again. k?   I also saw  Kill Bill  yesterday. That is the most stupid and ridiculous movie I've ever seen in my life. It was all violence and fight scenes; no plot. Normally I wouldn't mind so much; fight scenes are cool. But these fight scenes  sucked ass . Honestly. Half the time those samurai kids were just jumping and waving their swords around. How is that fighting!! There were  at least  50 baddies, and they all insisted on fighting that yellow-headed chick ONE AT A TIME. How stupid can you get?!?!?!   And she was allowed onto a plane with a frikkin katana... jeeeeez. It was painfully unrealistic. I was disappointed.   Other than that though, I've got no news. Other that I am pissed at a few things. Mostly G. He said I looked like the lead singer from The Vines (what with my hair cut and all) (I agree with him, except he has no right to say so) (plus he said it in a demeaning way; I think it's cool) (stupid kid). And he didn't do the damn brochure so now S and I have to do it  on our own time  and we're gonna get sooo many marks off for it being so fucking late... I SHOULDN'T BE RESPONSIBLE. I WASN'T THERE. Ahhhh!!! I hate that kid. Stupid Giggles. Also I am mad that we have to eat lunch with our homerooms tomorrow. I hate my homeroom. Okay, I don't hate my homeroom -- I am just indifferent to it. As in, I have  no friends  in my homeroom  at all . Arghhh!!! Spending time with my homeroom is absolute hell.   Ok, I am finished with my self-pity ^^; You can all roll your eyes and make an ugly noise at me now. Byee!

      Lots of news! First, my hair is all chopped off. It is short. And when I say short, I mean  short . It is so short that from the back it is not unlikely that I could be mistaken for a scrawny boy with long-ish hair. In fact, it is so short, and I am so scrawny, that I could be mistaken for a boy with long-ish hair from the front, too, if maybe it was dark in the room and I was especially ugly that day.   But this did not come to pass easily! Nay, I had to brave many heavily-accented people, crude jokes and the possibility of being made privy to a secret that could ruin lives... or rather, marriages. See, W is my hairdresser. She is Scottish. She still speaks like a Scot. She also has pink hair, laughs a lot and is very bubbly. She also has a kid who, in her opinion, is like me -- scrawny (though he's a boy, which is worse, because scrawny girls are more acceptable than scrawny boys), nerdy and anti-social. Apparently she and me mum talk about us and laugh about how similar we are when I'm not around.   Anyway, I have enough trouble with W by herself. That Scottish brogue does not make for an easy time of it. W is constantly cracking jokes that I don't get, and so I have to smile uneasily and try to figure it out from what the normal people are saying in response. She likes to poke fun at my anti-social, nerdy, scrawny nature, y'see.   But today!! Oh, today there were 3 other customers: an Irish lady, an Irish lady and a man who wants to be the secret lover of W. The two Irish ladies had as much of an accent as W did (except theirs was Irish), and not only that, they spoke  bloody fast !! Ah couldna understan' a bluddy word theh said! Now say that 10x fast. That was approximately how they spoke. It was painful. And to top it all off, they may not have had pink hair, but they had the same tendency to poke fun at my scrawny, nerdy, anti-social nature.   Wait! I forgot the cherry. The man? Yes, well, he and W may or may not have had a few tumbles in a run-down motel. I'm pretty sure they were joking, but I don't want to be held responsible for not going to their respective spouses and laying it all out to 'em. Of course, W and the man claimed that their spouses liked to watch, but ya never know... These 4 middle-aged to elderly people were dirtier, naughtier and, from what they said, kinkier than any teenage friend of mine. They think  we're  a bad influence on their kids, jeez...   Also: I haven't started to study yet. That says it all.   Also: wee! I've gotten back into drawing anime-type stuff. Iz fun, iz fun. Unfortunately it is also keeping me from studying and playing the piano and all those wonderful things that I should be doing but am not. Fortunately, I just drew the best character I've ever drawn yet. The main problem I have with them is that I can't think of good poses; or if I do, it flies out of my head in the middle of sketching it, which leaves me hanging, which is not a good thing. I'm thinking I should get a pose book. But those are usually of nude, flabby people, so maybe not. I'm not planning on drawing a 50-year-old man's genitals any time soon, thank you very much.   Sorry for not writing yesterday, but I was excited and bored at the same time so I didn't feel like it. Actually I'm not very sorry, but whatever. Oh! My template changed back at school, when I posted during French... So I guess, technically, I did post on Friday, but not really because it was during hours that weren't supposed to count.   I just lost 3 straight games of Cheat. That is sad. I also lost twice in Chinese Checkers. This is also sad.   Gonna go downstairs and watch the hockey game. Cross your fingers for Calgary, ne?

      Yeehaw. Once again I am writing a blog post during class. This is mostly in hope that my template will turn back to normal. I don't think it will though. I wrote to the Blog Support staff thingamabob, and they said I had to empty my cache or something... I don't think they understood my question. It turns out like that old template on  ALL  computers, not just on my own. My template just disappeared and was replaced with that stupid anime one!! Hm. Maybe this is a sign -- I should change my template to something anime-ish.   ALALAL. We are in French right now, wee. Mme. C isn't here because she's in the track thing (thank god). I don't think anyone in this class likes her very much, and I have to say I am one of them. Gahhh! She is evil. You know when we  didn't  go to St. Donat?? She made us, the people who didn't go, write 5 journal entries about what we  would  have done and how much fun we  would  have had, had we gone. Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid. I still haven't forgiven her for that.   So anyway, we're all in (or at least, we're all supposed to be in) Etudiant, doing those damn 3000+ Self-Test Questions. I'm not really doing it though, because it's either too easy or too hard and either way it's too boring. So I blog. It seems like this thing is addictive or something. It's just so bubbly and orange and blue...   Hm. Frodo is on the other side of the classroom all by himself messing around in Word. A is right beside me doing her work like the good girl she is, and Murdles is on my left looking at AX clothes or something... Oh, how typical of them all!!! Hm. And I'm blogging. Now what does that say of everyone... Murdles is materialistic, A is a hard-worker and I'm obsessed with myself. Yay!   I wish I could play a game on the computer except I'm not very good at them and I don't really know how to turn the volume down on this comp. Plus, I get very 'into it' when I play a computer game, so probably whoever that sub-teacher is sitting over there will realize I'm not doing work. People usually don't squeal in glee when they get an answer right. Or at least, normal (and cool) (and ridiculously good-looking) people don't. See, I am a normal (and cool) (and ridiculously good-looking) person. And she knows that. (They all know that). And so I can't play a computer game. I kinda lost my train of thought in there, so if it doesn't make sense I'm sorry. I won't bother to re-read it. Editing is for wussies!   Hmm.   Hmmmm....   I have very little to talk about right now, except that I'm impressed with people who wear all black. I'm not wearing all black (it's a grub day, BTW); I'm wearing a tooth-pasty tank/shirt/thingy and jeans. But I  could  have worn all black. But I didn't. So no, I'm not actually impressed with myself. But there is at least one person in this class who wore all black, and I'm impressed with HIM. But most people are, so it's all good ^^;   You know I don't like G? He's too giggly. We should call him Giggles. Honestly. He giggles more than most of my female friends do. That's just scary and wrong. We should kick him out of the school. Actually, I think he's leaving -- I won't spill all the juicy gossip in here, but if I love you and you ask me I just might tell you why ^^; heehee! Yes, my parents are relatively good friends with the parents who are best friends with G's parents. Hm. Plus, my sister is best friends with the daughter of the parents who are best friends with G's parents.   Yeah.   So anyway, seeing as I'm so bored and all and the teacher is giving me funny looks for typing so much. Ooh! There is going to be a french club next year; Mr L just came in to talk to us about it. I think I'm going to join. Maybe. If I wanna be all French-y in Montreal then I gotta learn the language, ne? But I think he said it was either 1 or 2 lunchtimes a week... ack! I got newspaper, man... *sigh* I guess I'll go when I can. Heyy maybe Britnix will join up too, and A and all those other cool people ^^; Then it'll be fun. And apparently Mr L is pretty cool too; that's what N says. Hmm... aw damn... what if N joins??! Aiee! No clubs with my sister. She scares me. I don't like spending time with her.. T.T I bet she won't go though; she doesn't seem like an extra-curricular kinda person...   So's anyways. That's about it. I honestly think I should stop writing now, just in case anybody catches me and I have to exit this window and delete everything and that'd be bad because I wrote such an insanely insane amount. I don't wanna lose all the writing. Ok. Byeee!

      Well, well, well. Look who's being a not-good student ^o^ hee! I am writing this during comp. sci., because I am bored and this is stupid. Also the exam looks like it's going to be easy. This is good, because even if it seemed like it was going to be hard I probably wouldn't have studied much. This course is  mine !! Muahaha. Now, watch me fail. *g*   So anyway, I'm glad T worked everything out with ya-know. Of course that still leaves the question as to why she's waiting outside the school for him every morning... and even more so, why she runs away and shrieks when his car drives in. I'm confused. Does she want to talk to him or no? I'm going to stop talking about this subject, because earlier I said I didn't want to get involved. This is between T and lover-boy. So, I'll stop. *stops*   Now... what else to talk about. Getting a hair-cut on Saturday, which is cool. I'm hoping she'll also wax my eyebrows. Dammit I hate plucking loll! And then I get my braces off next Wednesday, so yayy I can be a super-model again... *gags* hah. no. Wonder what everyone'd say if I came to school without  any  makeup on? It would be an interesting experiment, but one I am far too afraid to try *g*   I have a piano exam in... 3 weeks. I am scared out of my wits, because I am not prepared. I've hardly memorized my pieces!! Of course, it's my fault, because I don't practice nearly as much as I should, but still. I should probably stop complaining then. It seems like a lot of topics heavy on my mind are off-bounds. *pouts*   What else... ooh! Next period we have a part of the music exam. Hell, on Monday we've got  the  music theory exam. I am screwed for both. I can sing back intervals, but I sure as hell can't name 'em. I don't think I have a very good ear *sigh* Dazok. But I remember singing back intervals in my last piano exam, and that was fine. I did well in that. But aiee! Naming is hard. I lost that sheet saying which song sounds like which interval... blargh. I'm pretty sure I'll survive. BTW, on that whole musicalness topic -- A should totally have been the one to play with the grads. I'm so mad no one else realized that. She is the best frikkin flutist in our class, and yet nobody backed down for her! That makes me mad. She totally deserved that most. Who cares if she's gonna be in Alberta for that!!   So's anyway, J just gave me all the song stuff for the music test next period, so I'll leave to study. Byee!

      I have a Planned Tirade for this one, so hold tight for that. But first: before I met T, my life was nice and quiet. Now it's like someone's put a boom box blasting AVRIL LAVIGNE in my ear ^^; Not that I mind, of course... hee! Ok, onto the Planned Tirade.   So many of my friends are boy-crazy. I go along with it, but I'm really not that interested in anything even remotely resembling a love life. I mean sure, I guess it'd be nice and all, but it seems like the more guys (ie, Frodo) I 'get over,' the more I really don't want to be 'involved' at all. I suppose this is a blessing, seeing as it's fairly unlikely I'll go out with anyone before the end of high school, but it's also just a bit worrying -- everyone  else  I hang out with is obsessed with it! I mean jeez, just look at Murdles and J. Holy macaroni, do those two talk about anything  except  boys?? You know I love 'em, but soon as those guys start talking about Strawberry and Bruno and Cupcake and whoever... like wtf! They've got more nicknames for boys than I have for me! ^^;; I'm just not interested in that sort of thing, and you'd think, what with the raging horomones and all, I  would  be!   And it's not so much that I'm just a cold fish -- I can appreciate a bishie just as much as the next girl. I'm just not... anxious, I guess, or expectant that I'll get married or even meet 'someone special.' Because I can almost guarantee you, if it's not 'someone special' I won't get involved. I'm a Libra. We are lookin' for lifetime partners here, not a quick fix or a maybe-shmaybe.   Maybe that's the thing. It's not that I don't wanna have a boyfriend, it's that this boyfriend has to be 'the one,' or 'my soulmate,' or the 'Real McCoy.' You could call it high expectations. But you could also call it unwilling to throw away any real emotion on someone I don't really care about. Maybe I'm too protective of myself? I always thought that I was almost frighteningly uncaring of what happened to me; that I was more concerned about my friends. That I was either somehow worse/better than everyone else (depending on how you look at it) -- I could take more 'emotional pain' or something. But this really opens up a whole new window, don't it?   Or, it could just be that I don't like getting close to people. God knows that's true *g* I guess I'm expecting some sort of fairy-tale romance; a real partner, not just a boyfriend. Someone that, if the rest of the world just up and left, I'd still be happy with. Somebody who, like me to them, doesn't need anybody else except for me. Very loyal, I guess. And not so much overly dependent -- that's not what I mean -- but that we'd be two sides to the same coin or something. 1 + 1 = 3, you know?   So anyway. If that ever happens (again, I think this unlikely, due to my slightly (slightly? HAH!) bi-polar nature and onionness), I don't mind waiting for it. This, I think, is why I'm so... disgusted isn't the right word... impatient, maybe? with people who are boy-crazy. Or girl-crazy. Your choice. But aren't there more important things? Yes, I know I just spent an entire blog on boys, so maybe I'm a bit of a hypocrite. But after a few days of this nonstop nattering from various people concerning B O Y S, well. A girl gets tired, ne? And we really don't need to discuss, giggle and whisper conspiratorially about the various 75 positions to 'impress my man' from Cosmo. C'mon, do you really think that namby-pamby vanilla mag'll know  anything  about kink?? *BIG g* Please. Cosmo wouldn't be nearly so popular if it put the juicy stuff in there, and if you don't know  that , maybe your mommy should get you a subscription to Chickadee.

      *evil laughter*     03 Pushit    We've been trying something a little different this tour. We've been looking at one of our songs from a different angle, under a different light, so we can hopefully kind of see it almost for the first time. We'd like try that for you tonight, is that okay?   We're gonna need your help though. We're gonna need your help and your permission, so we need you to find a comfortable space, that is not only comfortable, but vulnerable. I want you to shut your eyes and go there, and we'll meet you on the other side..   Saw that gap again today. While you were begging me to stay. Take care not to make me enter. If I do we both may disappear.   Saw that gap again today. While you were begging me to stay Managed to push myself away And you as well, my dear And you, as well Pushed you away my dear   I will choke until I swallow Choke this infant here before me What are you but my reflection? Who am I to judge or strike you down?   But you're pushing me And I'm shoving you And you're pushing me And I'm shoving you   Rest your trigger on my finger, Bang my head upon the fault line You better take care not to make me enter If I do we both may disappear   But you're pushing me And I'm shoving you And you're pushing me And I'm shoving you   You still love me   We're pushing and we're shoving And you're pushing and I'm shoving   You still love me   And we're pushing and we're shoving And I'm pushing as you're shoving   And I'm slipping back into the gap again I feel alive when you touch me... I feel alive when you hold me... ...down   Slipping back to you   I am somewhere I dont wanna be, yeah Put me somewhere I dont wanna be Push me somewhere I dont wanna be Seeing someplace I don't wanna see Never wanna see that place again...   Saw that gap again today While you were begging me to stay Managed to push myself away, And you as well, my dear   If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay, You minimize my movement anyway, I must persuade you another way   Pushing and Shoving and Pushing and Shoving and Pushing me   There's no love in fear.   Staring down the hole again. Hands are on my back again. Survival is my only friend. Terrified of what may come.   Remember I will always love you, As I claw your fucking throat away. It will end no other way.

      Note to A: yes, this blog looks horrendously bad in Netscape and Mozilla. Mostly because I don't use those browsers, and also mostly (yes, two mostlies) because this is horrendously bad coding heh. I am not an XHTML wizard. Sorry. Go get IE if you want legibility.   Secondly!! Anime North was soo insanely fun!! N didn't show up, but we didn't need him because I met tons of people!! I hung out with S for most of the day, because T and S were in a fight and T was soo obsessive over that Dance Dance Revolution game... (holy shit those people have twinkly toes). I even bought a manga!! It's the first one in a series called Wish. It's crazy though, because, to be more authentic, it goes backwards... like, the front of the book would be the back of the book in normal books. Um? Yes, confusing. lol. Anyway, S got it cheaper for me ^^; Said it was in bad condition or something... hehehe.   And then we all started hanging out together again because me and S bought 3 Gun Smith Cats manga for A (who is like in love with that thing) -- in Japanese and everything. And we got a Cardcaptor movie for T, and lucky S, he got the other one. Great deal though. Only $20 for it all. Yayy!   So yeah, after buying a bunch of stuff, me, S and two guys who I didn't really talk to called A and R went to the hotel and saw Anime Idol (LOL!), a few anime movies, a few video game competitions, then went back to the Dealer's. Oh! And we went to the Art Exhibition too! There was some really good stuff there, and some really BAD stuff there. S is convinced someone is ripping off A, but I think he's just paranoid and overreacting.    Had lunch at Mr. Sub's (grilled chicken sub -- very yummy!! ^^;) and dinner at Swiss Chalet. Stupid T for not coming to eat with us!! By then she had a whole crew of DDR fanatics like herself. Actually I think one of 'em bought her like a $20 wallet by the end of it... she's got herself a fan club, man. BTW!! Really nice make-up, too.   It was absolutely pouring and miserable by the end of it, and I left at around 8:30. I am also convinced that I need my own cellphone. I was so paranoid I'd get split up from everyone else, and be unable to find anyone because I didn't have a phone... *sigh* Ok, ok, everyone is right. Cellphones are, after all, useful. Blargh!   All in all, though, it was insanely fun. I wish I brought a camera! (and a backpack, and food, and... thank you  so much  guys for preparing me... *sarcasm* lol) Tons of people were in costumes; they had a masquerade later. All the people were crazy-nice and funny and sweet, and it was just awesome!! So yes, I'll be sure to go to the August one, too. Actually now I'm mad, because I just finished the Wish manga and I wanna find out what happens to Madam Hisui and Kokuyo!! *g*   So yes, now it's my sister's bday. Yayy! (*sarcasm*) I don't like birthdays. I just like the birthday cake.

      W00t!!!! I can go to the Anime Con after all. Turns out the fam is coming over  tomorrow  for my sister's b-day, not today. So yay! I get to hang with T and A and S and N and lots and lots of other people from 1:30 to 8!! *many champagne bottles are whacked against a ship*   I don't even actually know what we'll be doing there. I'm sure it'll be fun (it's always fun with those people), but I don't know, exactly, what it'll be like. I've got a gothic-y shirt on though, just to make S happy (last time I was supposed to go, it was his birthday, and my wearing gothic clothing was supposed to be his present.. (??)). I also have a funky black belt on, that I haven't worn for a while. And rainbow socks, just to prove that, in fact, I am not a Satan-worshipping sadist. Actually my shirt isn't that evil-looking. It's just a black off-the-shoulder thing with big sleeves. Love it ^^;   I don't even know that much about anime! I just like the art, and I can draw it (sometimes). It's too bad Britnix can't go lol; she would totally appreciate it more than me. But she's in OTTAWA riding HORSES, the little fink, so too bad for her. I'll brag about it on Tuesday. Sucker... Hey, does Murdles like anime? I know P doesn't (A&I were making fun of him because we didn't invite him ^^;) Anyway, I can't wait!! Squee!   *g* I know at least 3 As now. It's a puzzle... which one do I mean? *jeopardy (whoa... sp.???) music plays annoyingly in the background* heh.   Oh, and T showed me this totally drool-worthy pic of You-Know-Who. I'd link to it, except then all those lurkers who read this thing would realize who Frodo actually is, and that'd be bad. But jeeeeez! Who knew he looked like that underneath a uniform?? *falls off chair* (NO, he's NOT nekkid, you sicko) (he just has a bathing suit on) (and sunglasses) eheheehehehe...   Dammit, I really need to buy a Blue Man CD. This fantastic Tool music is reminding me painfully of it. Grr. Ooh, who here likes Jet? I got my sister a Jet CD, soo... They're pretty good, but I think that hearing them over and over again would get slightly annoying. That guy's voice just isn't musical, man!! Where is the musicality! Also: music is more important than vocals. Just thought I'd let ya'll know. This is why I love Tool. 'Bout 2/3rds of each song is just music, no vocals at all. Love it. And the vocals are really muted, too, and the lyrics, and...   THIS is obsession. I would only murder T if she got to meet Tool. I wouldn't murder T if she went out with Frodo. So T, a hint: don't go seducing my band, okee? They're mineminemineminemineminemineMINE.   ...       MINE    , got it???? ^^;;; lol.

      So today's Friday. Lots of stuff happened, 'cept I'm too tired to talk about it. Suffice to say, I may be going to the Anime Con tomorrow, and might see N (wee! haven't seen him ... ever... *g*), and I managed to get all the way to Wonderland while attempting to drive home.... *sigh* That was stupid. lol. Fun, but stupid.

      Guess who!      69. Disgustipated        And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber. And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself. And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest. And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil. One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possesed me then. And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?" And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots! You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust." And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared, "Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!" Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus.       Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on........       This is necessary.       It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky then. That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too. When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this. You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this. You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. "If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin." Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color and, of course, those little people out there were yours too.

      Houston, we have a problem. I do believe that a certain guy called PB2 (not a typo ^^;) is being unnaturally and unnecessarily flirtatious. This is his nature. But, as I said, this flirtation is occurring in unusually copious amounts. Therefore, I am worried. Because, for various reasons, this cannot continue. I suppose the most important one is that he has something of a mop on top of his head ^^; And another is that The Promiscuous One has a mini-crush on him (or so I think).   So. T proposed to Frodo. Funny as hell, that. None of us are quite sure what Frodo's response means. But apparently he had a big smile on his face, so we're all assuming that's a good sign and there will soon be wedding bells ringing in the air ^^; Of course, he  also  hasn't 'gotten back to her yet.' Maybe he'll call her tonight? Either way, though, I think it went rather well. If it turns out he doesn't like the idea of marriage, maybe they'll take it slow. Or maybe T'll get over him. Or maybe he does like that idea, so they'll get married and have many short and hairy children, bless the li'l buggers. He didn't seem to be acting that strange later on in the day though; I don't know what that means. T is convinced Frodo likes SH, but I'm convinced he likes MO. Whatever. I'd rather he like SH than MO, because I like SH better. Best of all would be that he liked T (or me!! ^^;), but dazok. I'm just laying out the options, see.   A wants me to slaughter cows to appease the gods. Iunno about that. What about that whole animal cruelty movement?   I handed in my civics essay today. Almost forgot to number the pages (thank you Mr Y for giving me back the essay so I could!!), but I did, so a tragedy was averted. I have to write a French poem for tomorrow. I find this ridiculously stupid, but I find lots of things ridiculously stupid, so that isn't too much out of the norm.   Hey, guess what! I'm listening to SOAD today. I heard them on the radio yesterday morning (yayy! Go 102.1!!), and I was completely reminded of their existence. It's very nostalgic right now ^^; All I need is a tube of really cheap lip gloss in front of my nose, and it'll be like gr. 8 again! I only wore lip gloss as my make-up in gr. 8. That, and a tiny tiny tiny bit of cover-up for the gaping black holes beneath my eyes. Damn those allergies. I'd look like a corpse without my cover-up lol.   Now I'm burning stuff to appease the gods. I think these gods have way too high standards. How about I not say their name in vain or something??   S helped me with my comp. sci ISU after school today. Thank you!! It works and everything now, except he with his boundless genius did it a different way than the teacher told me to. Now I gotta figure out this new way of doing things, and try to make it look like it was me who wrote it... nah. Mr M will know. But hopefully he'll realize I only got help, and that S didn't just write the whole thing for me. Stupid sorting! I am not a programmer, dammit! I am a kid who needed a third subject to pass gr. 10! I might be doing superbly well in this course, but I definitely don't have the right mindset for it. This is insanity!!   Excuse me, comrades, I need to go grab some incense for the sacrificial rituals... (??) rofl.

      Wow. I have just completed an essay-writing marathon. Seriously! From the time I got home (around 4:45) to now (8:30) I have been writing my civics essay. It is 1607 words long. I swear to God though, an entire hour was just spent on that stupid bibliography. Ahh!! Craziness. I am going to be royally screwed in university. I don't think I like writing essays. Although it's pretty cool, seeing as I wrote it in under... 4 hours? That is plausible in university. So maybe I won't be royally screwed. Hmm... *looks pensive but is actually thinking about ice cream*   My printer is sadistic. In fact the entire computer upstairs is sadistic. It breaks constantly. And it freezes constantly. And it takes another fucking hour to print  after  hours of working!! I remember when I spent an hour working on something, and it took longer to print than it did to finish the stupid work... how is that efficient?? Madness, and I hate it. Stupid printer. It hates me.   N is turning 14 this weekend. She is such a young little kid! And she still looks older than me! And, I don't have a present for her ^^; Verver bad *g* I'll buy her a chocolate bar tomorrow or something... lol.   OMG! And T didn't tell Frodo that she liked him. Like wtf!! She promised me. And then he came late to school, so she didn't have the chance. And then she couldn't find me and everyone else at break to tell him, so she chickened out (dunno why -- it's not like we're actually gonna be there when she tells him, so I don't see why she needs us), and then after school T and I were running around like headless hens looking for him. And she had this totally perfect opportunity to tell him, and she didn't, the loser!! I am going to tell him that she likes him myself if she doesn't keep her promise, swear to God! On the good side though, Frodo's sibling (ahem *g*) knows now, so that's pretty cool. Proud of T for telling her that. Even if she did fall over... Murdles does that whenever someone cute walks by though, so it's all good.   The As are yelling at me to finish my entry, so I'll just leave now. Byee! And sorry it's not long ^^;

      Another Tool fix!! This time  46 & 2 .  Forty-Six & 2   My shadow's   Shedding skin and I've been picking Scabs again. I'm down Digging through My old muscles Looking for a clue.   I've been crawling on my belly Clearing out what could've been. I've been wallowing in my own confused And insecure delusions For a piece to cross me over Or a word to guide me in. I wanna feel the changes coming down. I wanna know what I've been hiding in   My shadow. Change is coming through my shadow. My shadow's shedding skin I've been picking My scabs again.   I've been crawling on my belly Clearing out what could've been. I've been wallowing in my own chaotic And insecure delusions.   I wanna feel the change consume me, Feel the outside turning in. I wanna feel the metamorphosis and Cleansing I've endured within   My shadow Change is coming. Now is my time. Listen to my muscle memory. Contemplate what I've been clinging to. Forty-six and two ahead of me.   I choose to live and to Grow, take and give and to Move, learn and love and to Cry, kill and die and to Be paranoid and to Lie, hate and fear and to Do what it takes to move through.   I choose to live and to Lie, kill and give and to Die, learn and love and to Do what it takes to step through.   See my shadow changing, Stretching up and over me. Soften this old armor. Hoping I can clear the way By stepping through my shadow, Coming out the other side. Step into the shadow. Forty six and two are just ahead of me.

      Haha, coming into school tomorrow at 8:20 so that if Frobert doesn't get down on his knees to propose to T, she's got someone to cry on. *falls off chair* See? Teenage soap opera! Oh, the pain, the agony! She actually had the nerve to  call  me.  No one  calls me! I hate phones! I am anti-phone! I will probably go into a rant about that later, so hang tight.   JR is trying to get me to guess the size of his penis. Do I look like I care?? Loser! Loserloserloserloserloser! I hope he reads this and sees that I say he's a L O S E R !! ^^; (JR, don't kill me. Please.) ^^;;;;;;;   I sat with A and C at lunch today, which was cool, because I never sit with those guys any more. I miss you!! *hugs* You two should come sit with us, man, because we are totally cooler than D&P ^o^ hahahahaha sorry D&P. Couldn't resist. (next year, girls, next year...)   So anyways. Just to clear things up: no, I don't   love   Frodo. I think he's cute and sweet and funny. Does that equal love? No! Of course not!! I am not the kind of person who goes throwing herself into passionate love affairs with people she doesn't even talk to!! I am not insane! I am normally challenged. Anyone who's in that madhouse conv. right now will realize I just copied myself. To get back to my point: No, I Do Not Mind If T Proposes to F. In fact I encourage her to ^^; It'd be great if the two of 'em got together; they're both cute people and it'd be very sweet. Plus, I'll just go back to PB, if I must. Cuz I still think he is the hottest frikkin guy in the school. heeheehee   Yes! Okay, this will be my Phone Rant. I dislike phones for many reasons. They make annoying sounds. They're confusing. They're loud and obnoxious and demand your attention. People usually are telemarketers or want help with homework. They tie up your hands, leaving you unable to do anything else. You can't listen to music while on the phone either, since you need to give the person on the line your undivided attention, which is just evil because I never have a fully focussed attention and when it's focussed it's very very short. I just ain't that kinda person. I need to MULTI-TASK, man. That's just the way it goes. Please, please, please don't take away that good ol' MSN!

      A thinks I'm obsessed with Frodo. I don't think I am. I mean it's not like I'm always talking about him (except in my blog, which I have every right to, because you don't  have  to read this and if you don't like it you can just bugger off), or stalking him like T does, or anything like that. I just think he is very cute and sweet and funny and an all-round awesome guy. How is that obsessing??? *puts down her telescope to look at everyone indignantly*   Hey, you know what's crazy? He pretty much fits every single thing I said in response to that perfect guy forward ^^; Look, ma! It's fate!   So anyway. I totally kicked ass in my science presentation, and I am very proud. Or at least, according to B&P I did ^^; I'll take their word for it, because I trust them and I like thinking that I kicked ass in my science presentation. Of course, the other thing that kinda pushes me toward that is that everyone cheered after. Which is always nice, because I like applause.   What is also cool is that tomorrow is a Day 3. I like Day 3s. I like Day 1s even more, but Day 3s aren't too bad. I have english first, which is cool, because that means Frodo's there and he's always fun. Plus, Murdles says she feels better so maybe she'll actually  show up  tomorrow, and Britnix will be there and so will all my other good buddies. Of course, we'll be working on those damn essays, so that won't be too great. But I'll live. Also! On odd days we have music! Yayy! I love music. I don't think I'll take it next year (A isn't taking it, and it's really hard, and I wanna stick to my social sciences so I'll probably be changing from economics to american history), so I'm trying to fit as much musicality into this last month as I can. Aiee! Exams in one month! Aw, crud.. *g* lol.   Hm. Does anyone really know what they want to do with their life?  So many people are like, "I wanna be a lawyer!" or, "I wanna be a doctor!" or whatever. I've got no idea. And not only that, I don't want to have an idea. I'm worried about university. If I go to university right after highschool... what more do I have time for? I mean, I guess I could do all my travelling after university, but.. where is the adventure? I still want to go walk across some country, or at least experience crazy things so that I've got stories for my grandkids. If I have any. Okay, rewrite: ... so that I've got stories for other people's grandkids. Sure, it's nice having an idea of where you're going, but if you just 'follow a plan,' where is the excitement? There is none. I'm just worried that somehow I'll get stuck in a box. I don't want a normal job. I want something that is challenging and lets me do my own thing. I almost (not quite, but almost) wish my life wasn't so great; sure, it'd be hell, but where are the stories? What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. And they give ya something to write in your memoirs.   If I could be anything... I don't know. I'd love to help out in Canada -- politics could work. Except I hate being hated; I'd either have to be really good, or not do it at all. I couldn't stand to do something that people hate me for. Philosophy seems to fit me really well too, what with me going off on tangents all the time about life, but what kind of career is that? Exactly. It's  not  a career. Philosophers died out with the Greeks and the Romans. You either teach it, or read it. Nobody does any actual thinking these days; our ancestors have done pretty much all of it. Or at least, I think so. If anyone knows of an actual, plausible career made out of philosophy (other than professor / teacher / etc.), please, let me know.   Another option would be writing. But as I doubt I'll ever finish a novel, journalism would be the only way to go... and I hate writing that way. I mean, I can usually do a pretty good job, but I loathe writing like that. It is painful for me to write like that. Bare facts are nice, but not my style. I like sticking in my personality and my voice. And if you do that in journalism, that's cheating; that is not giving the public what's  really  going on, that's giving the public what you  think  is going on. Not the same thing. Hopefully the doc and SC aren't reading this ^^; It wouldn't do for the newspaper staff to get wind of this... of course, I've already gotten the job, so what can they do? Oh ya! Me, AR and FR (whoever that is) got Co-Editor. And only 4 people applied. How great is that?? Of course, I'll be the only one in gr. 11, and with any luck FR will ditch us like she did last time, but ya know. Pretty crazy. And gratz to A for getting the managerial (is that even a word?) position at the Country Corner Store.   But back to my original topic. Or what's left of it. I don't want to live a normal life. I want stories and adventures that I can talk about when I'm older and there's nothing more to do. I'd like to be able to say that I went against the flow, and did something beautiful. Didn't bow down to the system, didn't lose the young ideals, didn't give in, didn't back off. Preferably, I'd like to be able to say that I never grew up, and that I'll be 15 forever, but I'm getting the feeling that's not going to happen. Ladies and gentlemen, it's official, Santa Claus doesn't exist, and Peter Pan isn't going to pick up Caleigh on his way to Never Never Land...

      And since it seems to be the current trend to post song lyrics...    Lateralus    by Tool      Black then white are all I see in my infancy. Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. Lets me see. As below, so above and beyond, I imagine drawn beyond the lines of reason. Push the envelope. Watch it bend.   Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind. Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.   Black then white are all I see in my infancy. Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me. Lets me see there is so much more and beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities. As below, so above and beyond, I imagine drawn outside the lines of reason. Push the envelope. Watch it bend.   Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind. Withering my intuition leaving all these opportunities behind.   Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line. Reaching out to embrace the random. Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.   I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected enough to step aside and weep like a widow to feel inspired, to fathom the power, to witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain, to swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.   With my feet upon the ground I lose myself between the sounds and open wide to suck it in, I feel it move across my skin. I'm reaching up and reaching out, I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me. And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been. We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.   Spiral out. Keep going, going...     Because I love them.

      Tons of things to update on! Since the last time I posted was on Friday, I'll go from what's happened since then...   1. I forgot to mention the concert! Heehee! The concert went really well; the band played its best ever, and senior choir did really well too (though not as well as I thought we did in Boston). Didn't talk to Frodo as much as I hoped I would, but ya know. Whatever works, ne? Played a game of jackass, lost, didn't play again ^^; Watched the jazz band, and they were fantastic. The Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy was just brilliant. I would have rathered they didn't turn up M's mic, just because I wanted to hear the harmonies more, but it was still just amazing.   2. Wonderland on Saturday. Practically no one showed up (which I predicted), and the line-ups were horrible and it was the frikkin Ice Age out there. Nonetheless, I had fun ^^; Hope K knew what her present was (they were bath bombs!!). lol, I went on 3 rides in 4 hours. A and I just hung out and danced in front of the Lazer Tag building... aw man, we should do  that  for someone's b-day! I love Lazer Tag!! There was also a cute guy with a checkered shirt, and his blue, blue-eyed friend was even cuter, but I didn't talk to them. I did wave though ^^; A and I also didn't get a chance to go on the new ride, the Tomb-Raider... by the time we realized we'd better get to it, since we had to leave in a half-hour, we also realized that the line-up would be waaay too long. But that's ok. We can go later, after exams.   3. Finished pretty much all my homework, which kicks asssss, man. Just gotta do the civics essay, get a few more items for my trunk, and I'm  done . Wee! Freedom!   4. I saw  Snatch  and  Timeline  over the weekend.  Timeline  was, as expected, reasonably crappy but with neat-o costumes and accents. Claire and Meuric made the movie, if there even was one. But   Snatch  ! Omigod! My sister was a sheer genius for making me watch it. It was brilliantly fantabulous! It was the craziest and most original filming I've ever seen, and the plot was just insane. I love-love-love-LOVED it. I honestly recommend it to everyone. Especially those who a) love action-packed violence, b) love mad-complicated plots and twists, and c) think Brad Pitt is cute! It was just genius, I tell you! Sheer and utter and impossible    GENIUS   !!! I'm in love, guys.  Snatch  is My New Favourite Movie of All Time.   5. New template. It's a bit different from the one I downloaded, but close enough. Used to be called "Alter Ego", but... isn't it pretty? And eventually I'll get rid of that little stripey remainder of the advertisement. lol, the way I got rid of most of it was by making a blank image in Paint and just sticking it in... now that part is just being ornery. Grr. I am the only person/thing/being allowed to be ornery!!   So that's it, mostly. Figured I needed a big update, to make up for the lack of them the past few days. I've been in a bit of a funk (it happens), but I'm okay now. Hopefully Frodo will start talking to me, too. If he doesn't I'll be mad. And probably stalk someone else and leave him for T. Who, by the way, is hilariously funny. Her life should be made into a movie (who the hell tells the guy's sister that...) *sigh* Nevermind. Just... yeah. heehehehehee...

      Yes, well. I'm in a slightly mopey mood right now. Lots of reasons. Mostly because Frodo didn't really talk to me today, which totally bugs the hell out of me. Since CISMF he's talked to me a lot ^^; Now we're all shy again. But that's okay. I'll get over it. Hell, maybe I'll meet someone at Wonderland tomorrow *g* D's not going, btw. He hasn't emailed me or you, so I think it's safe to say he's forgotten. He does that a lot lol.   Of course, I am a total loser for letting a boy affect my mood. I am currently being a bad role model. Little girls, do not emulate me.   But I mean there's other stuff too. Tons of work to do. Actually I miraculously finished my sci. presentation notes today, and most of my history trunk... all that's left is the civics essay. And that's due next Thursday anyway, so I've got tons of time. I'm a bit worried about my sci. presentation though ^^; I hate practicing, soo... might not be 100%-worthy. Of course not much of my stuff is, but I gotta pretend like I'm trying, non?   So that's my life, and it's cool and all, except it's also not because I'm bored. *sigh* Murdles likes someone else (so what else is new? ^^;), I still like the hobbit-meister, and everybody else likes Johnny Depp. Tally ho.

      Can't wait!! Extra time with Frodo ^_~ Anyways, class was fun today. Math test went very well, so I'm pleased. History was awful, what with that horrible, horrible movie we had to watch, but I didn't actually watch it so I'm fine with that too. French wasn't too bad. A few well-loved people, and I'm set for the day. Add to that we were mostly just learning about the French trip next year, and I'm happy as a clam. To quote that Brent kid from  Corner Gas . Love that show!! No canned laughter or anything. Lunch was fun, what with A flipping up C's kilt, and me snoozing in the grass, and everyone throwing peanuts at everyone else... Science was pretty cool too. Wish I was the one who dumped the water all over G. *g* Too bad P missed that. Also Frodo is insanely cute, so that was a plus too. heehee!!   So yes, here I am, sitting in Number 1 Dress, wearing shorts underneath the kilt in case A turns lezzie again, and I'm talking to a guy from the debate. Pretty cool. Also slightly relieved, since T (the guy, not the girl) has totally been ignoring me lol. A few more days like this and I'll delete him off the list. B says he's pretty cool when he talks to her, though, so maybe something will 'blossom' ^^; Because, ya know, he's got seductive eyes.   Congratulations to A for getting her first Brazilian commenter! *falls off chair* LOL!   And I love Maynard. I love him I love him I love him. Except I heard APC is 'going on hiatus' June 13 or something!! Aiee! No! I love them! Even if I kinda like Tool more now. Tool just has the cooler music/lyrics. But anyways. I'm done for now, see ya'll later. And thanks A for posting the lyrics to Tori Amos. The lyrics are nice, anyway. But I like to think I'm not hanging myself from a cross daily.

      I am a  Libra .  (Also known as "Scales")   You have to be a real loser to be born a Libra. Libras are born with two left hands, both of which grow out of their ass. They are tone-deaf and generally have poor eyesight. The senses of self-esteem and humor are in embryotic states at best.   Libras never have any money, their love life is usually a non-starter and they have notoriously bad luck both at work and at home. Pictures of mediocrity, they are incapable of standing out, surprising, outperforming.   Genetically unable to make any decision, they begin to convulse and sweat profusely whenever faced with a choice more important than "paper or plastic?". This is why their whole life they let others decide for them.   While they love to present themselves as patrons of the arts, their knowledge in the area runs no further than they can throw a grand piano.   Libras often end up writing tear-jerking memoirs full of half-truths and embellishments.   urlLink Find yours

      Anyone remember that old nursery rhyme? I'm not quite sure what brought me to type that into the title textbox... but, either way, it's cute. I think it's because I'm running out of interesting titles. So I'm improvising. But whatever.   Today was alright. Except various well-loved people missed the rehearsals this morning, much to my chagrin (OMG people can't just  skip  that!!), but other than that, it was good. However, the well-loved people were there for the rest of the day, so the various classes I had with those well-loved people after the rehearsals were quite amusing and interesting.   Comp sci is just infuriating though!! Apparently, though only Component 3 is due, we're supposed to have like half the coding finished -- and I'm not even close to that. WTF?? Grr. He is making up the rules, man. Totally going against proper teaching etiquette. Doesn't that bug you when teachers start going against what they originally said and all that jazz? I mean, now I feel terribly not up to scratch and inadequate and all those other unsatisfactory words.   Let's just call this the big vocab day, k?   Hey look, I'm a poet and I didn't even... *gags self* lol.   Music was hilariously fun. We did nothing, yet again. Music is my favourite class   of all time   lol. If the exams turn out to be easy, I might even switch from economics to music for next year. Just cuz I'll miss the whole damn class so much. Who's taking music again next year, BTW? If A isn't I don't know if I'll bother... she's my music buddy ^^;   So anyways, a few well-loved people played the piano, which was fun. Didn't know they could, actually, so it was a pretty cool surprise ^^; Then we just hung out for a while. And when A left (her grandfather was glaring at her... spooky...), I hung out with the jazz band. Since they were packing up to go to a Ronald McDonald's thing. I don't know either; don't ask. That was pretty fun. Saxophone is still great *g* And so is C. And all those other fantabulous and well-loved jazz people. *g*   Then afterwards, A and I did our scheduled math tutoring thing, seeing as I have a math test (DAMN YOU MR. M!!) tomorrow, and I got 69% on the in-class assignment... we did actual work for maybe 15, 20 minutes. Then T showed up, all the way from the middle school, and we just talked about guys and unpronouncable last names (mahabsldfjakjs!! ^^;) and how T is a stalker and Avril Lavigne sucks. Then T left, at like quarter to 4, and A and I just doodled in her agenda... All in all, quite a productive hour ^^;   Anyways. I'm just mad I didn't talk to him more. Suuch a coward!! But that's ok.   Oh! And one last thing -- C prank called Jerry... whoa. Funny shiz goin' on there, folks. Hey you know those rap/hip-hop/whatever they call it these songs? Where they pronounce it "thurr" and "hurrr". Here is what I have to say about them:       LOSERS!!

      Yes, a fantastically not original template. Just one I grabbed off of Blogger. But it's so insanely pretty and nice! And I just couldn't help myself... *sniffle sniffle* I've decided I do like pink, after all. *sigh* Turns out I  am  a girly girl... dazok though. Long as I don't play with barbies too often, I am not too upset.   And yes, by 'him' I mean 'The Ultimately Cute Hobbit.'   And yes, what will now follow is a bunch of complaints and exclamations and periods having to do with my life...   So. Frodo just up and talked to me in science. Which was cool, because, you know, I love him and all. Also, C didn't dump J (which, if you read the whole gang's blogs, you'll already know), which makes me very happy. Because I didn't know she was going to dump him in the first place, and when I found that out, I felt really bad, because I had already told Mrs. WW that the two were going out, which made Mrs. WW really happy because she just adores J, and so now that the two of 'em are sticking together I'm just ecstatic because I don't feel nearly so guilty. *keels over, out of breath*   I've got tons of work to do in the next week. Aiee! I'll get it all done (I always do), but it still stresses me out. Mostly because I leave it until the last minute, every time. But dazok too.   Ummm... Wonderland hopefully on Saturday, and OMG if D can come that'd be hilarious. I can't believe K invited him. She honestly talked to the guy for like 15 minutes!! And if any of you hit on him, I'll kick your heinies to the moon. He dated my sister. Paws off. *g* But he's still funny as heeeell, so izallgood. Do we know who's going at all yet? Too bad J&C aren't going. I like J ^^; I woulda liked to mention glittery tube tops, or something of that sort... heehehehehee!!   So, that's all for now. Sucks to P, for saying it was too pink and he didn't like it. *growls* *pushes P off the sacred cloud*   And, I also finally told T that I liked Frodo too. *whew* It was really getting to me there. Felt guilty for not telling her. So that is deeefinitely a load off the mind lol. I was actually worried that she'd flip out, but she took it pretty well; we both know it's highly unlikely anything will happen. Plus, you know how I am with crushes.... *wicked grin*   heh.

      Don't you hate it when someone you respect and love (aka, my mom) acts like an idiot?? This is why teenagers go crazy!! All of a sudden we start thinking on our own and realize that no, actually, our parents  aren't  perfect, not at all. I mean, mum is fantabulous. She does basically all the hard housework, most of the cooking, most of the cleaning... there is very little that she  doesn't  do, in fact. But jeepers creepers!! She's angry and annoyed with this 11-year-old who came to dinner last night, because he wanted to be with his mother rather than us kids. This, apparently, really pissed mum off. I'm not quite sure why. She seems to be getting indignant on our behalf - he ends up getting treated like an 'adult', while us (older) (more mature) (more NORMAL) kids are ignored. I don't really care. Neither does N. Neither does S. Neither does L. But for some reason mum is all up in arms about it.   Of course, there is entirely the possibility of me being close-minded and not being able to get in her head, and that a few hours later from now I'll be smacking myself for being dumb. I'll probably go into that later *g* But anyways, I just can't understand how she can be so malicious towards a kid that young. Is it really his fault if he just doesn't like us? I'm sure if I was his age I'd do the exact same thing. In fact, I'm positive I'd do the exact same thing. Mum just doesn't seem to notice that. But dazok.   On a happier note, I talked to Frodo for pretty much the entire last half of English... woo! Love that kid. If I was brave I'd go talk to him when he's off by himself. I think that's when I like him most ^^; People who like being alone and aren't afraid of loneliness inspire me ~v~ Oh! And did anyone else in my eng. class notice that  he did not talk to MO  once  ?? *cheers*   Yes... and about that smacking myself upside the head. I don't know about you guys, but I constantly say things that I end up regretting later. And I'm just like -- if only I had frikkin  thought  more before I said that!! And it superbly annoys me, mostly because I know I could have responded better had I just been thinking differently, more openly... if there is one thing about me that I hate, it's that I get so focused on one thing that I just stop thinking. Like blinkers on a race horse. Can't see the rest of the world, so I end up doing something stupid. And most of the time, I'm pretty open -- but just, sometimes, those blinkers pop up, and I'm entirely screwed.   Regrets suck, but I still think the world needs more of them.

      Debating was awesome!! I met soo many people (J is hilarious, C!!), including some cute guys (eee!) and some very awesome girls. I think BW and I got most of their emails, too. BW and I got along really well, I made fun of SAC guys' skirts and 'glittery tube tops' (LOLLLL *falls off chair* C, mention that to J ^^;) and they actually had a sense of humour about it, TCS was just beautiful and, the best part of all: debating was awesome! The first time was, obviously, just insane, and I was very, very nervous. Since I was PM, I had to go first, and my first 5-min. speech wasn't too great. But my refutations at the end were awesome, and I had gotten used to it by then and aieee! Funnnnn! Also, the speaker and time-keeper were hothothot in my first debate. The time-keeper especially. He looked like that guy from  Swing Kids  and  The Dead Poet Society . All my partners were just great, too. Got along fantasmically with them all.   So, in the end, I came in tenth out of forty. Pretty damn good, seeing as that was the first time in my life I'd ever debated, I'd only known about it for a week, and yadda yadda yadda. Normally the first ten spots or so are reserved for experienced debaters. But yayyy! Since CDS is hosting the Fulford Competition next year, I won't get to participate, but I sure as hell will be a speaker / time-keeper. So fun! Met so many people!! And if T doesn't have a gf I'll be jumping for joy ^^; More on that later though, heehehehee.   All in all, though, 'twas a grand success. Oh, and one thing the judges all had in common: they all thought I was a very convincing and energetic speaker. I coulda told 'em that, ne? ^^;;;;;;;;;;;; *gags on her arrogance*   OH!!! And J came I think 3rd in the Senior division! Or maybe 4th. But either way he got a certificate thingy! JD didn't do too well because he was really, really sick (as in, he wasn't in the van with us for fear of barfing all over everyone (which he did in his car on the way there)). And while we were eating dinner, the 'big speech guy' came over to C and told her that she had a wonderful gift, and that she shouldn't waste it. Of course, she also managed to convince two gr. 12s that she was their soulmate, but ya know. I think she may have a new boyfriend. Maybe two. Not quite sure. At the very least, the backseat was steamy ^^; heeheheheehe.   And T was the awesomely skilled and adorable guy from Crescent. Funny, cute, nice blue eyes and he looked like a hobbit. Cute guy overload over there, man. Yayyy! So's anyways, expect me to be quite argumentative over the next few days. Hehee. *jumps for joy and runs off to do her much-procrastinated comp. sci. ISU*

      The debate's tomorrow. I hate Mr M. Frodo rocks my world. I hate math. I hate science. I didn't tell the other Mr M I wouldn't be in class tomorrow. Mrs WW is pretty cool after all. BW isn't that bad either. Iunno what I'd do without my best friends. The trunk is due next next Monday after all. I'm jealous of MO. We're having ham for dinner tonight. Music is the awesomest class ever and I was so stupid to not sign up for it next year. I will miss Mr H! Mr H is my favourite teacher!!! We tied up MG with duct tape!!!

      Yesterday and today were just insane! I'm honestly going crazy. Tons of work, tons of  drama , tons of... aiee! Went to choir yesterday, no one was there (aka, A!!!), couldn't go to band today because apparently I had an entire frikkin essay due first period, and then I find out in first period that he was giving us the period to work on it, and then my Frodo-boy left, and then music was boring because 1. we were doing theory and 2. Frodo-boy wasn't there! Ackkk! I waited in the Eng. class for like 10 minutes waiting for either Frodo or my english test (neither appeared), I just had an unwanted cold shower, I have to practice piano otherwise there will be a grisly murder in PN's house, I have to write a speech for the debate  on Friday , and my partner is the scary and explosive CM, I need to write my science handout and I don't have my science binder  here , the history Grandma's trunk is due next Monday, and...   *keels over, out of breath*   BTW, in case you hadn't figured it out yet: yes, I do have a crush on Frodo. *sigh* I'm stupid. ^^; but that's okay.

      Forgive me father, for I have sinned...   (that's how it goes, right?)   eheheeeheeeheheh! Okay, well, the performance was pretty fun, even if aimlessly wandering around downtown wasn't. The senior choir's first song was by far the highlight of the show, at least for me -- so beautifully spiritual and holy-sounding! I love that sort of thing. Inspirational; good thinking music.    Despite everyone's utmost attempts, I did not go speak to the bass guy. Even if he was cute and tall. This was mostly because there was another, cuter and more-liked person there ^^; But we did have a nice lookie relationship *g*   Another really cool thing is that B is an awesome person. Never really got the chance to talk to her, but me, M & B hung out a lot waiting for rehearsals and performances and stuff. And she's a great kid! It's always fun to find out someone's awesome. I love being impressed ^^; This happened more than once today, too... heeheheheehee..   Well. That's not all for now, but just to keep ya on yer toes, I won't be saying any more o_O (shhh!)

      Well guys, this is my last day in Ontario ^^;; Tomorrow's the 11-hour drive to Quebec! W00t! It will be terribly fun, and I will undoubtedly buy lots of pretty things, but I have to say... I'm not looking forward to being in a car for 11 hours. I could barely stand it in a coach for that long *g*   There's a big white stain in my suitcase. I'm thinking someone had a big spill of shampoo a while ago. Shame on them, who ruined my suitcase!!! *shakes fist* Aw damn... I'm talking/writing/typing like T now... *sigh* Whatever.   Blah. I don't really have much to say. Except NH was pretty grateful for my booksite-list. And also I like apples now. I've had at least one apple a day for the past week. I'm revelling in my bracelessness, I think... *g* Looks like no doctor for me! *cheers*   Just to let everyone know: I have a copy of The Princess Bride. Anybody who wants to read it (because it is sooo good!!) is free to ask me for it =D But first come first serve!! So hurry! Hurry, I tell you, hurry!!!!

      Yayy! I passed my piano exam. I mean I don't know my  mark or anything, but it went very very well. It wasn't nearly as long as I thought it would be (20 minutes), and my technique wasn't too horrible, mostly. I screwed up on my List A piece though o.O Missed a whole 3 bars. But I just skipped past it and I thought I recovered really well, so hopefully the examiner won't take lots of marks off... OMG, the examiner was like Lynn's mother in Gilmore Girls *cringes* Except Chinese. Harsh, short, and heavily accented. I was moderately surprised that she didn't bow when I left. Of course... maybe I just didn't deserve to be bowed at *sigh*   Also: have I mentioned I'm volunteering with the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario? Yup. Him and MF, the head of DareARTS, have recruited me, with the help of NH, to write stories and find books for the drug-addicted children of Northern Ontario. I have to discover little fables from their Native American heritage, and we are to teach them morals and values. This should look good on my resume, eh? Of course, that doesn't make this any more fun. *grumbles*   I'm redoing my website. Iunno why. Probably because the old way didn't work on Mozilla, and now that my IE browser is screwy (5 seconds after opening it, a little error pops up saying it has to close), I want it to look good everywhere... so it's much more lowkey now. But still kinda pretty. Just wait 'till you see my Epic mini-site though!! It looks damn professional, I'll tell ya that ^^;;; *cackles*   I've watched Spirited Away 3 times now. Now for Princess Mononoke and Kiki's Delivery Service...   *loserloserloserloserloserloserloser...*   Well, I'm gonna take my list of books to NH now, so byee guys, have a nice life, see ya on the sunny side.

      I got bored with the old one, and I  really  didn't feel like making my own, so I grabbed this fantastico-looking thing off of blogskins. Isn't it cool?? And I love the lyrics under I Am... It's the theme song of that James Bond movie ^^;;; I love James Bond!! And as you all know, I am, in fact, a Bond Girl.   Among other things... Father's Day was fun. That kid L is the cutest thing since... ever! I taught him and his brother how to play FFX, and we just played that the whole night. *g* It was awesome. Neither were very good at it, but whatever. Unfortunately, I didn't get to show everyone the awesomest movie of all time -- Spirited Away. Have I gushed enough over that or what? It is  the  most imaginative, sweet, meaningful and fairy-tale-ish animation of all time. I loved it. The soot balls were too adorable for words... everyone must go see Spirited Away! Nownownow!   There are a bunch of strange guys right outside my window working on the deck. It is, to say the least, disconcerting. I woke up this morning to the sound of drills, yawned, blearily looked out the window (it was soo light outside), did a REALLY FAST double-take and was like wtf why are there strange guys outside my window!! I casually (heh) ran downstairs and freaked out and made my mom put down my blinds. It was funny. Scary, but funny.   My piano exam is on Wednesday. Ahh!! I don't know my scales yet!!! *dies* I will have to practice... tomorrow... :P :P :P Today I am far to engrossed in loafing. That's an awesome word.   Loafloafloafloafloaf...   I am the most anti-social kid of all time. I don't think I've gone to a movie with friends since like March. In fact, the most sociability I've had was going to K's 16th Wonderland party. And when P&K came over to volunteer. Jeepers creepers, I'm a hermit already... Although, I am getting some practise on my drawing skills. Which is always fun.   Strangely enough, I'm listening to Limp Bizkit right now. How weird is that? It all started with someone saying their theme song was Full Nelson, too. Bizarro. I've forgotten how tacky they are. And how they swear every other word. That's quite amusing, actually. I'll bet they write the song lyrics and are just like, "Let's see what happens if we substitute every second word with 'fuck,'"... I won't say what the result is, for fear of sounding too much like that which I'm insulting ^^;;   I'll stop blathering now. I don't know why I felt like writing such a long post, but whatever. It happens sometimes. I think, because I've hardly spoken to anyone my age for the past... year... that I'm talking to myself now. It's a safeguard from insanity. I don't think my body feels I'm quite ready for insanity, if this is what boring ol' sanity is like :P   One more thing!! I'll be in Quebec all next week. From this Saturday till... Tuesday. Or Wednesday. Add 10 days to Saturday, and I'll be back then. Ok? Funfunfunfun! I luuuurve Quebec. W00t!

      If I sing a song will you sing along or should I keep singing right here by myself? If I tell you I'm strong will you play along or will you see I'm as insecure as everybody else? If I follow along does it mean I belong or will I keep on feeling different from everybody else?   If you haven't already heard me crowing from the rooftops, yes, I just bought Audio and The Complex by Blue Man Group. I'm in love. Audio has music, plain and simple -- elaborated music that's played in most of their shows. The Complex has lyrics, and a lot of guest artists, and the three phrases up there are lyrics from a song: "Sing Along." In fact, those are all the guy says, and he just repeats 'em over and over. It's awesome. That's one of my favourite songs.   It just lets you think or drift away, without being in your face or obnoxious or anything... I don't like listening to songs with words, unless it's all very musical and the words aren't supposed to pop out any more than the rest of it.   I am in a slightly grumpy mood, for various reasons. I'm tired. I've been conscripted to write a story for DareARTS, something which I am most certainly not looking forward to. A really good friend of mine said THE most jack-ass thing he's ever said to me since the day I met him, but the worst part is that another, even better friend, who was there when he said it, didn't even do anything to defend me. I'll get over it -- just I don't exactly trust either of them at all any more, which really makes me mad because they both used to be best friends. Guess this just goes to show ya that high school friendships don't often last past graduation for a reason. I have a piano exam next week and I'm not prepared yet, at all. Just I can't bring myself to practice, for all the reasons stated above.   All in all, I'm pissy. Don't bug me. I'm currently of the opinion that becoming a hermit  now  might serve me better than waiting until I've grown up. I love people and all, I just can't stand them.

      Oh jeez, thank god ^^; My baby's home!! Finally! Actually she came home Friday  night, but I'm still very relieved. She was /poisoned!/ Not intentionally, of course. We don't know exactly what did it, but we figure she ate a decomposing animal or a good number of toads (because toads are poisonous). She's not allowed to eat more than a handful of gastro-intestinal food every two hours, she's not allowed to go outside without someone with her (for fear of her getting into whatever it was again -- she's an 'out-patient,' and isn't fully recovered), and she has to take 3 huge pills every night rolled up in a meatball... it's gross, yes. Her forelegs both have these shaved parts on them, from the IVs they had connected to her... 3 IVs! That's more than I had when I broke my arm!! It was really serious, apparently... *cries* but it's okay now. She's going back to the vet tomorrow for a check-up. She's still pretty dopey and it's easy to see she's not feeling herself, but at least she's walking around again... before we took her to the vet the first time, she refused to move :S   YAY IVY! And good luck everyone in the math exam tomorrow!

      Oh yay. Mr M decided not to show up today. And Z and I were the only ones who showed up anyway. So now Z and I are sitting across from each other in the library, and this is not the most splendid way to spend 3 hours. *sigh* I am not happy with this. In fact, I'm rather mad. *growls*   But A chopped all her hair off! She looks much older, scarier and punk-ish. She needs to wear spikes and dye her hair black. And a worn leather jacket, and some baggy t-shirt with a swear word on it or something. Maybe she could just borrow MG2's clothes? ^^; I am very proud of her for cutting it off!! Very brave. It's hard to get rid of all your hair after having it long for a while.   Umm... so yes, my dog is sick. I'm going to try not to talk about this, because it makes my eyes all watery -.-   I have nothing more to say (blah), so I'll just wander the net and be dumb.. *cheers half-heartedly*

      I'm going to keep this a short post, mostly because I am terribly sad and worried and tired. Yes, I'm posting this before extra-help. Anyway, my dog's sick *cries* And you all know how much I love my dog. Ivy's been at the vet since yesterday morning, she's been sick since Tuesday night and still nobody knows what's wrong with her. They're taking more tests to find out what the problem is. But here's the thing -- she's never really been gone from home for this long, and I can't help but think how  lonely  it is! I really really miss my ikkle baby, and I just hope nothing's really wrong. Apparently it's bowel problems (so far), but the vet can't see anything obstructing 'clear passage..' So yes, I am very sad and slightly devastated and in a bad bad mood.

      Because I am bored, and have just been swimming for the past few hours, and therefore tired, I will merely copy A's survey. I am terribly unimaginative ^^;   --Name: Caleigh Jean Minshall --Birthdate: October 11th, 1988 --Birthplace: Credit Valley Hospital; apparently it was a terribly traumatic experience, I took 12 hours and my mom vowed never to go back to that hospital again. She didn't, either. I was born right on my due date though, which is pretty cool. --Current Location: Bedroom, Caledon East, Ontario, Canada --Eye color: Blue-grey --Hair color: Brown --Height: 5'4 *sigh* --Righty or Lefty: Right --Zodiac Sign: Libra! Woo! Go scales!  --Innie or Outtie: Innie, obviously. Do I seem like an outtie person??   // Ver. 2 - Describe   --Your Heritage: Irish / English / French-Canadian. Izgood, izgood. --The Shoes You Wore Today: Black leather school dress shoes --Your Weakness(es): Overly critical of myself and others. Hugely high expectations. At times I am a total introvert and hate people (as unlikely as this may seem to some). I don't like leaving my house, or travelling, unless I know exactly what I'll be doing or whatever. Does not get along well with strangers ^^; --Your Fears: Mostly just that I'll die lonely. I wouldn't mind if I was just alone, but if I was lonely, that would be sad. That's why  Scent of a Woman  touched me so much -- I'm afraid I'll end up like the Al Pacino character from that movie. Also, I'm afraid of the dark ^^; not nighttime dark, but alone dark, when it's all quiet and spooky. I have a far too active dreamlife for that to be healthy. --Your Perfect Pizza: Cheese, pepperoni, whatever. Long as it's not raw or oozy. --One thing You'd Like to Achieve: finish my own book ^^; write a song, whatever. Something that I'm satisfied with, though.   // Ver.3   --What is(are) your most overused phrase(s)?: "Wowie!" "Fantastically awesome" "Insanely fantastically awesome" "Mad-crazy, man!!" --Your first thoughts waking up: Take me now, O Lord... --The first feature you notice in the opposite sex: Sense of humour, and apparent intelligence --Your best physical features: Hair, I guess. Eyes -- but just the eyes, not the bugginess around them (damn allergies). And I like my skin, too ^^; --Your bedtime: 10pm on school nights, and 11 on weekends. Without fail. *g* Early to bed, early to rise, makes a girl healthy, wealthy and wise! --Greatest Fear: Dying lonely, definitely. --Your Most Missed Memory: When I could still tell people about how I had my own world full of heart-creatures and trolls, and they'd think it was sweet and original, not weird.   // Ver.4   --Pepsi or Coke: Coke --McDonald's or Burger King: McDonald's, now. McFlurries, mmm.. --Single or Group Dates: Group, until the guy and I were better friends. Single could get awkward ^^; --Adidas or Nike: NIKE. Because they have a great slogan. "DO IT." How many slogans can be so blatantly applied to sex?? --Chocolate or Vanilla: Chocolate!!!!! Yes, A, I agree with you there. --Cappucino or coffee: Iced capp! I tried T's at Anime North, and it was soo gooood... plus, Tim Hortons! Not Starbucks! Woo! --Boxers or Briefs: Boxers, definitely. Boys who wear briefs are queer.   // Ver.5   --Do you smoke?: Never. But I love the smell of fresh cigarette smoke ^^; --Cuss?: Only sometimes --Sing Well?: Nah. I can hit notes, mostly, but I don't have that great a voice. --Do you think you've been in love?: Nope. Except with my dog. Yes, I'm in love with my dog. Go to hell. --Want to go to college: OF COURSE. Jeepers creepers... life without learning is like life without ... living... *blinkblink* --Liked High School?: Sure. I don't get along with many of my fellow students, but the teachers are all awesome. --Want to get married?: LOL A! This is why I love you! And  no , I don't want to get married. If I meet the right person, I'll get married. If not, I won't. Simple. I ain't lookin' for a husband *g* --Type with fingers on the right keys: Constantly. People who chicken-peck bug me ^^; --Get motion sickness: Only when I've read in the car for too long. But I love roller coasters and that kinda thing, so I guess I don't get motion sickness too bad. --Think you're attractive: Sometimes. Other times I think I look like a corpse. I don't think I'm so much attractive as loveable ^_~ --Think you're a health freak: God no --Get along with parents: Very much so! I love 'em. Everyone always complains about their parents, but mine are the bestest ever. --Like Thunderstorms: Yeah!!   // Ver.6 - in the past month, did/have you:   --Consumed Alchohol: ewwww no! --Have Sex: ewwww no! --Made Out: ... ewwww no! --Gone On Date: *sigh* NO! --Go To the Mall: nope --Eaten an entire box of Oreos: every day, man.. every day --Eaten Sushi: ewwww no! --Gone Skating: ewwww no! ^^; I  watch  people skate. I don't skate myself!! --Made Homemade cookies: ewwww no! ^^;;; --Been in Love: only with Ivy!  --Gone Skinny Dipping: *shifty eyes* nooo... --Dyed your hair: of course not --Stolen Anything: Nope.  // Ver.7  --Have you ever played a game that required removal of clothing?: hee. Yes --Been trashed or completely intoxicated: never! --Been caught "doing something"?: Look, if you're gonna "do something," at least be  discrete  about it... IDIOTS. --Been Called a "Tease": of course not. Me, tease?? --Shoplifted?: nah.   // Ver.8   --Age you hope to be married?: Look up for an answer to this whole marriage thing. --Numbers and Names of Children?: 2 to 4 kids. No idea what the names will be. I like the name Christopher, though... and Taylor. O.O Tristan!! ^^;;;; --Describe your dream wedding: Small, in the country, lots of flowy white material. Apple orchard! Tiny rural church, only close friends and family. The family that I like, at least ^^; --How do you want to die?: I'm immortal. I don't die. --Where do you want to go to college: MCGILL! Well, anywhere that's got a super-good social science program --What do you want to be when you grow up?: Professor of history/philosophy/etc.? Historian? Writer? Musician? ... possibilities are endless. Don't forget that. --most like to visit?: Wales! Big castles and lots of green. That'll make me happy any day.

      Yippee! Got an Elfwood account, except it's on a queu and won't be published for about 3 years. I'm frantically worried about tomorrow's music exam, but I also refuse to practice. I am a stubborn mule. Other than that, no news, and since people are screaming at me on MSN about eurotrash, candles and Prozzac, I'm just gonna go...

      I've watched 3 good / funny movies now.  Something's Gotta Give ,  Prom Queen  and  About Adam . Stuart Townsend was in the last. He is soo cute!!! It's about this one guy who seduces an entire family, without any of them knowing about the others... it is absolutely hilarious. It should be restricted, but it's hilarious. Something's Gotta Give is funny too -- I'm gonna end up being like Erika. Except not as famous and beautiful lol. And Prom Queen! Inspirational comedic cheesiness! Gotta love it, man. Go see it. It's awesome.   So anyway, I've been doing science study notes the whole day, and I should probably continue doing that. What I'm especially worried about, though, is the music playing test. Ahhh! I can't play the flute, man!! I suck!!! T.T   So I'm gonna go now. Nivbed has got some awesome muzak, check out Pandora.

         02 Eulogy    He had alot to say. He had alot of nothing to say. We'll miss him.   So long. We wish you well. You told us how you weren't afraid to die. Well then, so long. Don't cry. Or feel too down. Not all martyrs see divinity. But at least you tried.   Standing above the crowd, He had a voice that was strong and loud. We'll miss him. Ranting and pointing his finger At everything but his heart. We'll miss him.   No way to recall What it was that you had said to me, Like I care at all.   So loud. You sure could yell. You took a stand on every little thing And so loud.   Standing above the crowd, He had a voice so strong and loud and I Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so Eager to identify with Someone above the ground, Someone who seemed to feel the same, Someone prepared to lead the way, with Someone who would die for me.   Will you? Will you now? Would you die for me? Don't you fuckin lie.   Don't you step out of line. Don't you fuckin lie.   You've claimed all this time that you would die for me. Why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?   You had alot to say. You had alot of nothing to say.   Come down. Get off your fuckin cross. We need the fuckin space to nail the next fool martyr.   To ascend you must die. You must be crucified For your sins and your lies. [sic] Goodbye...    BTW, the history exam went fantastically well; so easy! That's why I didn't post last night, of course -- studying. That, and watching the Flames kick the Bolts' bums halfway to the moon!! GO FLAMES GO!

      Wow. Where to start, guys?? I have so much insanely good news that I am fit to burst!   We will go in order. So, this morning, I went to school, all dressed up and preppy in number-one dress, just for the Awards Ceremony. I was expecting at least an hour of boring ol' Mr D and not so old but almost as boring Mr Y. Then, Murdles kindly pointed (yes, much pointing) out my darling mommy, who was, I thought, on TV for an Ontario book club special. And then! Murdles pointed out my darling  daddy , who was supposedly at work and yelling at his employees' insubordination!! At that point I became suspicious.    I  knew  that my sister had won the Intermediate French Award.   But, as everybody is well aware of, ei is very often wrong when she says she  knows  something. Though my sister deserved that award (STUPID MO), it wasn't her. 'Twas me! Looks like my sucking up and participation in the Eversley paid off, folks. 'Lil ol' illiterate me got the Intermediate English award. I got three rounds of applause, too! Mostly because I walked down / up the stairs so slow, but still...   And, it looks like my friends are geniuses. A got the Intermediate Science award, Britnix got the Intermediate Art award, and MM got the Intermediate Spanish award... and jeez, who knew there was a  Guidance award ... *falls off chair* (looooserrrrr)   And then! After being almost positive that my debonding (aka FREEDOM FOR MY TEETH) appointment was on Saturday, mum runs up and says, "Caleigh! We've gotta go to your ortho appointment!" And I was like wha.. ? But I went! And now my teeth are brace-free, except for a few permanent ones behind my teeth that aren't ugly, and a retainer that makes me talk with a horrible, horrible lisp. But that'll go away in 6 months, and it'll officially go away in 2 years. I had no idea my teeth were so big. I am also very proud because there are no blotchy spots on my teeth, either. That's right. I  brush my teeth , you unhygienic slobs...   But there's more! The Civics exam I had like... 30 minutes ago was fantastically easy. The essay especially. All in all, I think it went very well and I am very proud of myself ^^;   But there's even more! I had piano last night, and PN said I played beautifully and I think I got him to stop worrying. I only practised a little bit, too. Of course I have the recital next Saturday, which sucks, but once I screw up in that I'll never have to do it again, which is superbly cool.   So anyway, now I'm stuck here till 4:30 because my dad has to pick us up and he can't get here at 3:10. *sigh* This is starting to become a habit. Fortunately, tomorrow's the last day of school (woo!), so that's only a little bit longer. Everyone is sad that grade 10 is finished. I'm not. I'm not happy, either. I think I am an emotionless freak who only gets upset at things that aren't real, like  The Scent of a Woman  or  Beautiful Mind  or something.   BTW, A, my post was totally longer than yours ^^; There  is  some use for staying till 4:30 in school, isn't there... I can show up A in my amazing typingitity! *cheers* *bashes champagne bottles against various ships* I am going to run out of champagne soon. It's just such a festive thing though; I can't help myself!   History exam is on Friday. I'm okay with that; history isn't too hard. It's actually pretty easy, because everything flows. Everything makes sense. See, math and science aren't like that. You can't guess how multiplication works because you know how to subtract. History, though, you can figure out the patterns! It's just all about human reactions and stuff; easy-peasy lemon squeezie. To quote Mrs. WW. She's cool. We came to a bit of a truce a week or so before the debate, and now we're good.   It is now 10 to 4. I'm feeling kinda hungry, except I can't eat anything solid for 24 hours. Well less than that now, because I got my braces off a while ago, but still. It was originally 24 hours, so we'll stick with that.   How about this? I'll list all the books everyone should read to be like me, k?   -  A Game of Thrones  -  A Clash of Kings  -  A Storm of Swords  -  A Feast for Crows  (soon as it's out!) -  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  -  American Gods  -  Neverwhere  - All  The Sandman  comics - All the  Calvin and Hobbes  comics -  The Onion Girl  -  The Ill-Made Mute  -  The Lady of Sorrows  -  The Bone-Doll's Twin  -  A Room of One's Own  -  The Land of Og  -  The Arkadians  -  Uther  -  King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table    Guess that's about it. These are all fantastic books that I love very very much, and they all have an honoured place on my bookshelf. I think these books explain why I think the way I do. They could also explain why I see things that nobody else does. And why I am just a bit afraid of the dark. Only when I'm alone in the house, though. And when it's nighttime. And when the dog is outside so nobody is there to cuddle with me.   I'm officially hungry. Maybe I'll waste away to nothing before my dad gets here, and he'll be so overcome with remorse when he sees my shrivelled skeletal dust that he'll vow to never keep his one remaining daughter waiting again. Ooh, better: maybe  N 's hungry  too , so  she  can waste away to nothing and I can just bask in the knowledge that I am an only-child and my dad will always pick me up at 3:10.   I am such an evil sibling.   It's 4:00 now, and I have nothing to do. It's very boring. It's a pity they blocked all the game sites; I like games. Maybe I'll waste away of boredom or something. Or hunger. I even took my shoes off, and I'm not struck with any marvelous idea of anti-boredom. This is scary. Normally, when I take my shoes off, I'm just bombarded with marvelous ideas of anti-boredom. I am honestly worried that my shoeless creativity has vanished. Because, you know, that's where I get all my ideas. They come up through my ideagnetic socks, zap through my feet with a little bell-sound and then they echo around in my chest for a while. Sometimes, the really good ones, hurt a bit, because they bounce so hard against my skin. Finally though, the Mindful Hoover sucks them all up through my neck and into the processing factory. They get processed, and since they're all marvelously fantasmical they always get through in one piece (unlike many with-shoe ideas). My Muse finds the best one, and that's the one I use!   No, actually, I don't think that's how it works, but since nobody knows for sure it could definitely be a possibility.   When I become Queen of the World, I'm going to do 3 things:   1. I'm going to make it illegal for anybody to be taller than me. Those that are, will have their heads (or more, depending on how tall they are) chopped off.  2. I'm going to make a huge palace full of cakes. No one will be allowed to go in except for me. 3. I'll ban all uniforms from schools! And throw all ties into a bonfire!   It is now 4:20. ZS is here talking to me, so that's cool. He's not a bad guy. I hope he can't read this ^^; So anyway, I'm gonna publish everything before he realizes I'm writing about him... Byee!   BTW, A, I totally beat you ^o^

      First, let it be said that I really don't like G. I did the brochure in a record 15 minutes, and now I have nothing to do for an hour. This is evil, unnecessary and boring. Actually I woulda had to stay here anyway (my sister is staying 'till 4:30 for some unknown reason), but I like blaming him nonetheless. Because I HATE HIM. Got it?? Stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid... *bashes G's head against a wall* HAH!   I can't wait for summer. My parents are super-mad because, other than a few days of volunteering at DareARTS (who wants to join up?? I need at least 3 other people, so if you wanna, just say so, and I'll tell you when it is when I find out), I have nothing to do. Like, nothing. *g* Awesome, eh? We're going to Quebec or something for like 10 days, and I've got piano and harp lessons going on, but other than that, nada, zilch, rien. I am a happy camper, let me tell you. I simply cannot wait to let my brain languish. By September it'll be a steaming mass of swamp goo. Woo!   I can work on my story and my pictures and (if it's not too hot) walk outside wit da doog, maybe I'll even go to a movie if I ask some people.. ooh, and let's not forget the Anime thing in August... yippee! I had so much fun at the last one, and S claims that the August one is even better. So I can't wait! Plus, Britnix'll be there. Which will just be awesome, because she's cool.   I don't like libraries because everyone can look over your shoulder and see what you're doing. It is also insanely crowded here, and crowded places bug me, especially when everyone in the crowded place is old and tall. Old and tall people bug me too. It seems like they could step on me or go "Abracadabra!" and make me vanish. I don't like the idea that I am so easily made non-existent. Oh Weed Goddess, make me a Dandelion... *g* lol A!   About A. She ditched us in French! She felt 'sick' (yeah, right, A ^^;) and so she 'left.' I'll bet she is just carrying out her dandelion world peace plot. I wouldn't put it past her. That kid is slyyy... living with evil, sadistic grandparents must do that to ya. I know that if I lived with my grandparents I'd go crazy too. But probably, if I lived with any of you, I'd go crazy. I'm much too used to my own family. And I love them.   Do you guys think it's an instinctual thing for mothers to love their children? That, as soon as we.. popped out.. (bad mental picture), they were just overcome with love and willing to throw themselves off of cliffs to save us? I don't think so, but my mum swears it's true. She'd be the one to know, of course, but for some reason I think it's just  expected  mothers are like that. Not that it's actually the truth. Then again, I feel somewhat the same way about my dog (*blush*)... maybe I'll be like a super-mom and commit suicide for no reason at all other than to prove my love for my kids... Martyrdom! Woo!   But if my mum's right, and mothers really do just become automatically overwhelmed with love for their kids, then what about dads? Are dads like that, or are they just kinda along for the ride because of their attachments to their wife? Or maybe dads come to love their kids more over time. See, that's what I thought mothers would be like; they take care of the baby until the baby's old enough to talk and then they love each other because they love each other's personality. That almost seems like a better system. Why love someone who's disgustingly self-obsessed? Because some people's kids turn out that way. I would hate to have to love my kid just because they grew inside me. It's  A Woman's Choice , I tell you! *g*   It is now 3:50. I am bored out of my mind. I think I'll try to keep typing for this entire period, and then maybe I'll get an award for posting the longest post in Blogger history. I'll bet that award is already taken by A though. I'll beat her!! *growls* heeheehee!   So, what to write about...   OH! S's unrelenting insistance that I date N! No! He's old! He's grey-haired and wrinkly! Or not quite, and even then I wouldn't know because I've never actually met him in person, but still! He's graduating  this year , how weird and freaky is that?? He'll be going to university in like... a week! Not only that, if he did go to university, what would be the point in my going out with him ^^; AND, if he can't find someone his own age, I am wondering why I'd go out with him either.  Obviously  there's something wrong with the boy, if no girl his age will go near him... ^^;;;   It's 4:00 now. I'm browsing some art sites because I'm bored. Namely  urlLink DayDreamer  and  urlLink Nivbed's Artistic Extravaganza . I love them both. Nivbed's are kinda disturbing, and Julie's are kinda sweet. Very fantastical, impossible and dreamy. I love the Troika one by Nivbed, in his Finished Illustrations section. Go see!! Oh, and another good one (sexxxxy guys heehehehe!):  urlLink Jo Chen . Whew! You have never seen such sexy anime boys in your life, I swear. They wear leather and they have tattooes!! *stands back in awe*   4:07 by the comp clock, about 4:03 by the library clock. I'm going crazy. I have 30 minutes to blow!! ahh! I wish I had music here or something, except with the way I bash my bag around it'd probably be unsafe for my CD player. *sigh* I hate how we have to put our bags in our lockers. Damn fire hazard. I have 6 loopy things on my bag from broken key chains. This is getting ridiculous.   There is a white board on the wall in front of me, and it says Gill -Reid } Carson, Bolster -Gentile } McRory, and Sansone -Udovich } Leach. English? Must be. But why only 6 people in the class?   I love how they have all the movies on the wall. If I was sitting over there (but I'm not, since there's no computer on that side of the room), I wouldn't be writing in my blog. I'd be reading the blurbs on the movies! I love doing that. They have  12 Monkeys  here, know that? I love that movie! It's so crazy. They actually don't manage to save the world, which is the cool part. It's a bit like... wait. No. I won't ruin the ending for you. Just let it be said that my favourite character is named after a car ^^; And they compare the Earth to a sausage.   I would also like to apologize for leaving our team blog Hitchhikers. I was suddenly reminded of that blog, for no apparent reason... *wink wink nudge nudge* A is re-doing it for her and her English friends. But here is my excuse! I always post on this blog first (obviously), and so I'd have nothing to say on Hitchhikers... or I'd just repeat myself! If you really want to know what I think about life, just check here. Don't make me re-post everything because that's dumb and stupid.   I am mad that Calgary lost last night. Stupid refs. We shoulda won. We totally outplayed 'em.   BTW, if you're Joe Bob from Zimbabwe, I don't live in Calgary. But that's the Canadian team in the finals, so I'm cheering for them because they're cool. Long live the Maple Sugar!   I am sitting very contortedly in this library chair and people are giving me funny looks. I don't mind so much, since people usually do, but if the librarian asks me to stop pretending I'm in Cirque du Soleil I'll be mad. I like Cirque du Soleil, BTW. If I was strong and brave and flexible I might have even wanted to work in it.   It's 4:20 now on the comp. 4:15 on the library clock. These guys have got to get their story straight.   I want a nice sketchbook to doodle in, and make my own crazy dream-story like Charlatan Marmalade from teh nivbed. I like his art. It's very surreal. A should use it for a new blog template, it suits her ^^; I think she expresses herself better though writing, though. And music, too. A, do you like art?   So anyway. I am very bored. I think eventually the government is going to make it required to have a blog, so that they can keep track of all the crazy delinquents and follow the law and all that. I don't think the world will ever be perfect. I think everything is holy and has meaning to and of itself. I don't believe in any gods or goddesses or magic or anything like that. Or at least, if there is, it's not any more or less special than anything else. I think everything, in the end, is equal. I do believe there's such a thing as karma or whatever. I think I could totally teach the niners English. I also think that I'll never be able to speak perfect French no matter what, or perform (musically) completely nerve-free. I think everything everyone does is some form of art and should be treated as such. Or at least known as such, so if you're tired and cranky you're allowed to say "math is stupid and pointless and I wish it would die" as long as in the back of your head you know you're just being tired and cranky and you really don't with it would die.   Let's take a deep literary breath, k?   This chair I'm sitting on seems to be higher than usual, and because of that I feel very tall, even taller than this guy beside me who's probably in gr. 11 and is taller than most people; in fact, I think I'm a giant right now and if I stretched I could probably break through the ceiling and eat the sun -- it would probably burn a bit, but I'm sure it is juicy and sweet and after it had gone off my tongue it'd taste really good, probably like non-alcoholic alcohol or something, and maybe I could even reach past that and I would pick all my friends up and you could sit on my shoulders, and we would all sing starsongs and raise baby birds and angels as our pets, and live in a yellow submarine that floated and maybe all the Earth would drown and it would only be a puddle I could splash in.   You see how much height means to me?? ^^;   Ok, it is officially 4:25 on the library clock, so I am going to post this, gloat at the incredible length (it could have been longer if I hadn't been canoodling on nivbed and jdillon), and sign off. I love you but I love 4:30 more. Byee!

      Do you know, I love Neil Gaiman. Really and truly. Go read his blog. He is too flipping hilarious! He kinda reminds me of A, actually; does crazy things and can write about practically nothing for eons :D A, we love you!! It's the weird, funny questions he gets from readers (and his responses) that he posts, though, that are the greatest. They also make me want to be famous. I'd make a website devoted specifically to the stupid things people ask me. I'd spread rumours about myself, too, just to see what kind of other stupid questions people would ask me. It'd be so fun!! I'd love to make a website just dedicated to real, stupid questions I'm asked. Maybe I'd post answers, too. Ooh! It'd be like a 'serious' website, except all the questions are stupid!   Mwahaha... And then, I shall rule the world with cocoa-puffs and Irish whisky! w00t!   Among other things, I went to the DareARTS office this morning, because N refused to email me back with the answers to my questions. Stupid, stupid, STUPID woman. She hates me. Anyway, so I go over there, she answers my questions, I prepare to leave.  And then!  M and N spontaneously decide to RE-DO EVERY SINGLE VALUE I HAVE TO WRITE ABOUT! As in, go through every single lesson plan, every single story, and every single activity concerning this goddamn Human Spirits Collection and change it. For no reason except they 'didn't like the order.'   I dunno about them, but this would have helped a  lot  more had it been done a few months ago.   But that's not all! Not only are they imbeciles for fixing something that's not broken, they don't make decisions. I was just dying to get out of there, so I practically led them by the hand and said, "We'll do this, this, and this." I'm 15 frikkin years old. Come on. I shouldn't be able to boss around the president of one of the most highly-regarded charities in Ontario. But I had no choice! The two of 'em would just go on and on about how they  might  do this, how they  could  do that and that it would  possibly  be beneficial if they did something else! They talked for ages about the specific word they'd use to describe the value! Does it really matter so much?! The kids are 5-9 years old. They're not Einsteins. Their parents forced them into the program in the first place. And I'll bet they're wasted half the time, too, considering where they live. Do they  really   care  whether we use the word 'sympathy' or 'empathy??'   Adults can be really dense sometimes. I hate it when people are indecisive. If they'd just  do  the damn thing, maybe something would  get done . Hemming and hawing ain't gonna help nobody, and isn't that what DareARTS is all about?   On the bright side, I've got over 15,000 words done. Yay! That leaves 35,000 'till 50,000!! And I've been writing for what, a week? Mwahaha!! I'm just scared that someone who knows what they're talking about will read it and say it's crap :P I mean, it's not the Great Canadian Novel, of course not, it's Fantasy, but still. I'm a touchy person ^^;;;

      Since it's the current trend to show how many songs/artists we know, I will write for your perusal 20 songs that I like. They're in no particular order, because I am an indecisive person and to choose one song that is my favourite would be very difficult for me :) This may also turn into a list longer than 20. heh.   1. Kiss From a Rose, by Seal 2. Lateralus, by Tool 3. Magdalena, by A Perfect Circle 4. Rose, by A Perfect Circle 5. Aenima, by Tool 6. Give It Away, by Zero 7 7. Song for Olabi, by Bliss 8. Suite Pee, by System of a Down 9. Mr. Jack, by System of a Down 10. Awakening, by Damning Well and a few other people that I forget 11. 22:20, by Danny Lohner, Maynard James Keenan (w00t) and Puscifer 12. Everyone's A Junkie, by Our Lady Peace 13. Alone in the Universe, by David Usher 14. Butterfly, by David Usher 15. I'm No Angel, by Dido 16. All You Want, by Dido 17. PVC IV, by the Blue Man Group 18. Mandelgroove, by the Blue Man Groop 19. Mosquito Song, by Queens of the Stone Age 20. Optimissed, by Skinny Puppy   Okay, only 20, aren't you lucky :) And what can I say? I'm a house music kinda person :D hehe. Actually, even the techno type music in there is  good  music. It's better than most of the junk on the radio these days, at least. And sorry for putting artists down more than once a few times... I woulda put even more songs by them, but ya know. That would have looked slightly pathetic.   So, that's about it. I'm angry at A and A for not saying thank you for the cookies on my chatterbox :) And BTW, for some reason I can't post on chatterboxes right now, so imagine that on A's chatterbox, it says "YAYAYAYAYA TOOL!!!!!! LATERALUS IS A BETTER SONG THOUGH!!!!!", and on A's chatterbox it says "YAYAYAYAYAYA MAYNARD!!!!!!!!! GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!"   Thank you. :)

      A insisted that I write a blog entry, but I have very little to write about. I think I remember writing about NaNoWriMo earlier, so I'll talk about my plan with that. I'm planning on trying that, this November. But I'm also using the 1,500 words a day meter for THIS month, and August, too :) So far I've only got 9,700-something words, but that's in four days. heh. 1 r sp33d 7yp3r. w00t!     It's not the epic story, it's a different one. I got way too bogged down with the Chisien outline, and it just got tedious. This time, I've tried a different tactic: write the 'idea' like a blurb (vague, but exciting and  going somewhere ), and then write how the ending will work out, and every time you get an idea write it down. Whether you think it'll work or not. So, I've got I think 5 documents, all for the same book :P One's the plot&blurb document, the other's just to keep track of the family (I'll explain that later), then there's the glossary, then there's the log (how many words I write a day, and the total for each day), and finally the story itself. So far, it's going really well! The site  urlLink www.hollylisle.com  helped a lot: candy bar scenes was a good idea, as was just 'having the end in mind.' Not an outline, per se, but just knowing how, eventually, it's going to end. That helped. It allows a lot of freedom. Holly Lisle also gave me the idea of 'scenes,' which makes it easier to keep track of progress and where I am. I've always been  aware  of scenes, of course, but now I'm actually using them consciously.     NaNoWriMo also helped because it got me to realize that, mwahaha,  QUANTITY  over  QUALITY . My entire first chapter needs a rewrite, because my style changed in the middle of the second chapter, and I like it better now, but I'm gonna wait until I'm further on. Let's get the  story  out, and then fix it up, ne? :) Hence keeping track and making a log. Looking back on your progress is a real good motivation.     So far, my biggest problem is POV *sigh* Too omniscient! Must... focus... on... Taj!! :) I'm working on it. I'm even thinking of switching to first-person, but I've never entirely liked that POV because you're restricted to your character's voice. My main character happens to be only 12 years old (at this point in the story), so that wouldn't work. I like describing settings, surroundings, etc., and first-person doesn't usually allow that kind of freedom. I haven't had much difficulty actually coming up with the plot (in fact, so far it's all been winding together quite nicely, with very little direction from me at all -- yay!), so that's good. Another big problem, though, is just sitting down and writing. Sometimes I'll just sit there and stare at the screen and agonize over how to start. Usually, once I actually  do  start, I'll end up liking it. It's just taking that first plunge. As I said, though, my  first  first plunge wasn't too good :P I'm starting to cringe at the thought of that first chapter... heh.     Oh, right! I was supposed to explain why I have to keep track of the family. Well, this is mostly because the family's pretty big.     Oh, all right. I'll explain more ^^;;; Taj is a princess. Her dad, the Emperor, has five wives. He had about thirty kids, too. So, it's hard to keep track of them all ^^;; I've only named the wives, the dad, Taj, and maybe three of her siblings. But, I just wanted to make sure nobody started switching brothers and sisters, or ages, or training (all imperial kids are 'dedicated' to a certain caste, like the arts, craftsmanship, etc.). So I've got a seperate document for that. Yeah.     I won't go on to explain the entire story unless you ask me to :)     A is insisting that I have other things to talk about. Other than the fact I've only written like 700 words because today is music day and I'm being swamped with practice, there's not much going on. My harp lessons are going surprisingly well, considering I play the harp once a week (at the lesson). My piano lessons aren't going so well, but I'm planning on going over the songs before I leave. They're  hard songs! They're grade 7! I'm still in a grade 6 mindset!!     That's about it, though. Have fun! *gives cookies to A and A*

      More books!! *squirreldance* I am such a bookworm!!!     Also, I got my hair cut. It's short again, like before, except maybe a bit shorter. And I got my eyebrow waxed hee. I hate plucking. Waxing is painful, but it's quick. Plucking is painful, and it's long. So! Easy to choose.     Among the books I got, though... THE SANDMAN! By Neil Gaiman! His comic series! Omigod!! I love him. You guys all know how much I love him. He is one of the most hilarious and thoughtful and just downright AMAZINGOFANTASTICOMAGNIFICKOWONDERFULOAWESOME writers of all time, so I am very very pleased. Booklore is starting to expand its inventory, I think: they have a lot of cool comics now *g* I got the Nausicaa one from Booklore, actually. That is a  good  comic!!     I'm downloading a Messenger Plus! update, and it is making my conversation with A very very slow. This is insanely annoying. I'll type out a sentence, and thirty seconds later each ... and ... every ... character ... will ... appear ... one ... by ... one.     Ahhhhh! Writer's nightmare!!     It's 29% finished now.     30%     31%     Hah, did I scare you? Did I make you think I was gonna count up all the way to 100%?? *cackles* 32%!!!     There is a whole organization that is about writing a novel in like a month or something. NaNoWriMo. Something like that, at least. It's pretty crazy. And apparently they have a hugely massively fantastic party at the end of it, too =D wee!!     Speaking of hugely massively fantastic parties, A and I are going to the Burning Man when we're 21. hehehhehee! It is a week-long festival of the arts, out in the desert. You basically bring all the things you'd bring if you were camping out there alone (LOTS of water, and some food, and stuff to tie it all down with because winds are usually pretty high and storms are really sudden). There are tons of parties, and it turns into a CITY because so many people go (30 000). You walk around, give your art to people (be that music, paintings, sculptures, etc.), and see what other people brought or built while they were there. There's nothing for sale except ice, coffee and pop, and no cars are allowed. You can bring a bike though! Anyway, at the end of the week, there's a huge bonfire and they burn a 40ft. wooden 'man', in a massive bonfire, with singing and dancing and all that.     This is my dream, folks. I'm going to a Burning Man when I'm old enough!! Partay partay partay!! *Italian chicken dance song playing in the background* w00t!

      Hallo everyone, yes, I'm still alive!!! *g* I've just had very little to write about for the past... summer... lol. But I'm doing pretty good. Got an awesome unique vinyl thing for my car =D Yayy Need for Speed: Underground!! Hehe. I think the only reason I play it is because my dad is super-bad and I enjoy rubbing it in. *cackles evilly*    Do you know, I am very mad at A and B because neither of them have   REPLIED   to my Ren Faire email???    By the way, if anyone else is interested, just ask about it. Basically a lot of people (don't worry, you don't have to!!) run around in costume and talk with a half-decent Elizabethan accent. Lots of funny funny funny shows, lots of shopping and sparklies, lots of food and even a huge jousting tournament ( not staged ) with these massively gigantic horses and these big guys all in armor swinging swords and stuff at each other. It's fun.    Lots of cool music-o, too!    On Tuesday I had my piano and harp lessons again... the harp one went rather well (considering I didn't practice what I was supposed to), but the piano was iffy. I think I'm getting so good at sight-reading mainly because I don't look at the pieces until the lesson itself. *sigh* They are so patient with me!! Actually, PN kicks out the students who don't practice, but he thinks I do (because I'm so fan-flipping-tastic hee). Yup. We still make fun of KH who never practiced once and was very very bad and ended up quitting because she found a piano teacher who basically lived in a better neighborhood. Oh please. There is nothing wrong with where PN lives. In fact, I love where he lives; lots of cute little houses, lots of little kids, a few punks/goths/scary teenagers -- all in all, a very family-friendly place. Of course, he's moving now, but ya know. It all works out in the end.    I am such a bookworm!!! I have read basically a book a day for the past week. It's kind of pathetic. A, have you heard of Andre Norton? I'm not sure if I like her or not... I like her style of writing, but the plot/characters seem slightly cliche and even a bit *gasp*  boring . But apparently she's a classic and she won the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement. So Iunno. It could possibly just be me being a crappy book critic ^^;;; I still think everyone should read George R R Martin, though. He wrote the best fantasy books of all time. A, have you read those yet???? He is much too brilliant to be human. Oh, and read Neil Gaiman, too.  American Gods  and  Neverwhere  are my favourites...  Neverwhere  is super-funny and just all-round-GOOD (horror + humour + insanity -- WEE), and  American Gods  was just wow. I totally didn't see the end coming. I was very very surprised. That doesn't often happen to me. If you give me the starting sentence of a novel I can sometimes predict the entire story ^^;;; but the best thing was, it all fit; even if I hadn't thought of it, it all fit perfectly and that's just the best ending ever. So read it, and see if you can figure it out!!!    Of course, with my luck, some kid who's got the mind of a 3-year-old will figure it out and then spit on me.    Other than the fact I've been watching a strange amount of English movies lately, I think that's it. Oh, and  Le Divorce  isn't very good. But  Mickey Blue-Eyes  will always,  always  be the funniest thing since ever.

      Welp, lots of exciting and fantastical things have happened since I last wrote. Mostly, a lot of music things, but also a lot of bathing suit things and book things, and even a bit of video game things.   Shall we start with the music, then?   Yesterday was a Tuesday. I know it was a Tuesday, because I have my handy-dandy computer calendar open. Don'tcha hate how as the summer goes by you lose track of the date? I feel like I'm floating in some sort of green jelly. Really. Anyway, back to my point.   Yesterday was a Tuesday, and as such is my 'muzak day.' I had two music lessons yesterday. In two different instruments!! *shock* That's right, folks, I am doing more this summer than sitting on mah bee-hind. In the morning, I had an hour-long lesson with RE, on the harp. (cue long paragraph about hippies and The Bohemian Dream)   RE lives in a barn. That is the nicest way to put it. The first time I went there, it was like: where's the house? Surely he doesn't live in that! But he  does  live in that, and it's actually a very nice that, if rather dusty and infested with ants. Fortunately the ants don't bite. Anyway, we sat outside yesterday, with his dogs and the cat running around like mad (actually one of the dogs just lay down beside me and when I wasn't playing I was giving a very satisfactory belly rub to her ^^;;).  I still have hives :S So, we were sitting outside, hoping it wouldn't rain, and I was just a bit worried how it would go. I hadn't seen him for a while, and I  quit , so it's not like we parted on absolutely wonderful terms (although they weren't bad). He didn't seem to be holding any grudges, and in fact he went a long way to make me feel better about myself and all that (must be that hippy thing). He let me toodle around a bit, getting to know my new harp (more on that next paragraph), and I was very surprised by how much I remembered. I remember lots of songs; how they should sound, little funks I added a while ago, etc. The only thing that're different are my fingers: they don't remember where the strings are! So that made for some very frustrated playing. Also, RE went on and on about modes and transposition and craziness like that. Apparently it's a lot different on the harp than it is on the piano (although who knows why). RE thinks it'll just 'sink into me' after a while, but Iunno. I just hope musictheory.net has some info on nodes and... aiee! It's insane, let me tell ya.   Ok, I lied. This paragraph won't be about my harp, it will be a nice reprieve for your eyes after reading that huge chunk of text. That is to say, I am continuing my narrative on the lesson. Deal with it ^^;; I've forgotten how much I admire the way he lives. He might not be the most sensible guy I know, or even the most musical, but his confidence that that is the way to live is really awe-inspiring. I don't know if I'd ever want to live in a barn, communing with nature and farming for money, but knowing him has really changed my outlook on things. If I hadn't met RE, I coulda turned into one of those all-matching fashionistas who can't get their heads outta their makeup that are so common at CDS!!! I think everyone should meet someone who's like RE. They just remind you to figure out what's important to you in life, rather than what everyone else figures is important. I don't think I'm as down-to-earth as RE, but I'm sure not the frooty-drink type, either. It's just a great thing to be reminded, once in a while.   On to my harp. Her name is Oceans. She's one of his oldest harps, and she's the one that he brings to markets and such when he plays. I don't know what type of wood she is, but she's really dark (I think it's the varnish or something), and  very   slender, delicate and fragile: no direct sunlight, no leaving her standing and no letting strange Muggles play her! *g* Because she's so slender (although very tall), her soundbox isn't that big, and she's very very quiet. For RE, this isn't a problem, because he's fiddled with her to make her able to hook up to an amp. Since I don't have an amp, or have any idea how to hook the thing up even if I did, she'll just have to stay sweet and quiet and all that. *whispers* I don't think he tuned her properly though. I'll have to re-do it.   Ok, I'm done with harps. To the next lesson!   The next lesson was at 6:30, for half an hour, in piano. I'm in GRADE SEVEN now, guys!! One more exam, I'll be in grade 8 and I'll get a credit for it and I'll be able to quit. *cheers* One of the other music teachers in the studio had stolen all the gr. 7 books (grr!), so we had to make do with photocopies, until PN can order some new ones (or steal back the old ones heh). It went well!! For the first ten minutes or so, we talked about my exam and how it went and what went wrong, etc. He already knew my mark, and since it's above the average (72%), he was pleased. Although he did think I shoulda got over 80% ^^;;; I didn't practice my technique enough, what can I say. We haven't gotten the comments back, but I'll see 'em soon. Anyway!! He offered me Rollo icecream, I refused (which I now regret, since we have no good icecream in the house and I miss it). I'm only playing two songs right now, and they're both a bit harder than I'm used to... not so much the fingering or speed being hard, but the rhythm and figuring out when I come in. I've always been a bit weak on sight-reading; what can I say? It was over pretty quick, as the lessons always are -- I'm always surprised. PN and I almost always go 10 minutes or so over the time I'm supposed to be there (I think I'm one of his very last lessons), but since we spend the first 10 minutes or so just talking about what's up, it kinda evens out... *guilty grin* lol.   Today we went bathing suit shopping, just me and mum because shnigga-boom has a drama camp thing she's leading, and anyway N always makes us feel bad when we go bathing suit shopping ^^;;; Not all of us are super-model material!!! Anyway, as you have all probably guessed, not many bathing suits fit me. At least those that aren't in the kiddie section... but, lo and behold, I've got two more bathing suits now!!! I'm sure this doesn't seem much to all you normal-sized people, but to ME, who's been using the same bathing suit for I think two years now, it's BIG NEWS!! I'm actually reasonably happy with one of them, too. You know, I hate bathing suits. I feel like I'm walking around in my underwear. And basically I  am , because most bathing suits are even more revealing than the underwear I use... *sigh* I am such a prude. I DON'T WANT EVERYONE TO SEE ME!!! My parents did their job too well. Really. I've never been kissed, I hate showing lots of skin and if a boy hugs me I smack his nose off.   heh. Not literally, obviously.   Then we went to Chapters!! Squeeeeee!!!! I got lots and lots of books, and so I'm happy happy happy. Books just make me all warm and fuzzy. Games do too, but those are much more expensive than most books so I don't get them as often. That's ok though. Once I figure out a game, I tend to get tired with it, so that's no good. And with me, I either figure out the game super-fast, or I can't figure it out at all and it bugs the hell outta me. Either way, I quit ^^;;; I have very little willpower, I'm thinking.   Finally, the game things!! A while ago, my dad and I got a few more PS2 games. Unfortunately, since my dad was there, all the games were HIS types of games. ie, racing, wrestling, sporting. *groans* Stupid dad. So anyway, we were playing the racing game last night (I forget the name, sorry people, but it seems pretty cool), and I totally beat him!! My dad is such a bad driver!!! ^^;;;; He probably doesn't appreciate me announcing this over me blog, but this is what happens when you can't figure out how to turn when it says you have to turn!!!! =D So yes, I beat the crap out of him. He made me restart every time I got too far ahead, though... hehehe. You wouldn't believe how much that made my mum laugh when she found out. Wow. Seems like all I do in this family is bring hilarity. I don't mind, of course, except it bothers me a bit when I don't understand what's so funny but end up laughing anyway. Feels like I'm being manipulated or something.    Maybe I should be a clown when I grow up!   hehehehehe....   Nah, clowns wear too much makeup. I haven't worn like any makeup since the summer started. It's kinda strange, actually. I've gone out all these times, makeup-less. Last year I woulda died before I did that. It's not that I've gotten any prettier; I've just kinda resigned myself to my fate. I will be ugly GRACEFULLY!! Mwahaha!!! *smites everyone to death*   Sorry, guys. Couldn't resist.

      Just thought I'd let everyone know that I got honours in my piano exam ^^;;;; which is a SPECIAL THING, unlike honours at CDS *grins* Honours in the RCM is, as yet, still a holy and unblemished institution. Of course, with my receiving 'em, that is quite likely to change. *cackles*   I'm in a better mood now, in case you can't tell.   Where is everyone????? I haven't spoken to anyone. In fact, I have spoken ONLY to A, A and B this whole summer. And maybe S a little bit. This is making me rather scared. I do have other friends... don't I??? *shifty eyes*   Do you know, I almost typed shitty eyes there.   For some reason this strikes me as hilariously funny.

      I probably shouldn't be saying this on my blog where everyone can see how completely friendless I am, but I haven't gone out with friends since summer started. ONCE, a few people came over to my house, but that wasn't even really a 'social thing,' since they were volunteering with me. I feel very pathetic. The worst thing is that I'm not actually missing the going out with friends, but just embarassed that I'm not doing anything. If there were no people in the world to make fun behind my back, I probably wouldn't care and I'd be happily hermit-ized forever and ever and ever. I think the most I'll be doing this summer is the Anime Con thing in August, and the Ren Faire... the Anime Con is even looking doubtful, cuz I haven't spoken to A, S or T for ages.   Hopefully one of 'em will call me. *g*   Among other things... my cousin came over on Friday, and left yesterday. I dislike her, practically on principle now. We've never liked her ^^;; But the thing is, her parents are really nice, and we feel sorry for them (y'know, them living with that she-demon and all), so we babysit her every once in a while. She's the strangest kid, too. In some ways, she's REALLY mature for her age, and in others she's just downright stupid/immature. She's got some real social problems, too. She's either left-handed or ambidextrous, with all the usual problems that go along with that, and she goes to that Mentor Team school, where kids who need a bit of help get it. She's doing really well, too, apparently -- it's so stupid, the reason they can't push her up into the 'higher' school is because she's doing painfully bad in French and spelling. Who the hell needs French and spelling?! My dad can't spell whatsoever, and he got the highest marks at his university in psychology and business, which (at the time of his being there... *grins*) were some of the newest fields where not much was known -- ie., you got marks if you 'figured stuff out,' rather than just reciting by memory.   And I mean it. He REALLY can't spell. It's funny.   He's left-handed too, come to think of it...   So anyway. The world seems to be leaving me behind; that basically sums up my feelings right now. I talk to school friends so rarely that I've got no idea what's going on any more. I've got the same ol', same ol' friends that I've been with since early or mid-grade 9, and they're all hanging out all over the place! I guess I'm happy in my little group of... maybe 5 people... but being the paranoid wretch I am, of course I'm always afraid I'll get left behind. Accidentally even; not on purpose at all. My friends are way too nice to ditch me. But you guys are spreading out, what can I say, and I'm not -- I don't get along with everyone, DEFINITELY not, and those that I get along well with, I think I'm already friends with you ^^;;; why  should  I spread out? To keep up with the Joneses? Bah. I think I'll stay right where I am. All the people worth knowing, I already know. You guys can go hang out with as many eejeets as ya want =D Left behind or no, I'll find something to keep myself occupied with.   ... this might be the best reason of all to go outside again: I'm going crazy. Heh.   I've always thought it would be cool if all our minds were suddenly opened to everyone else: all those hidden, animalistic desires and impulses for the world to see. Would the thin layer of civilisation be enough to keep everyone from retching at the minds of everyone else? Would the knowledge that everyone feels like that, that it's the  control  that matters, not the impulses, keep you from isolating yourself from that revolting mass of humanity? I so often think that if we could just accept that revolting mass of humanity that is US, and come to love it for those imperfections, that we'd be able to accept everyone else too, and the world would be a much better place. After all, I think it's true that you are just as badly off as the worst off person in the world: as long as one person suffers, everyone suffers. No man is an island!! Those horrible imperfections you see in others are only reflections of those in you; maybe the reason we consider those imperfections so horrible is that they remind us of how horrible our imperfections are. I know that's the case with me, lots of times. Other times it's just because they're stupid. But then, the fact that I'm so bothered by stupidity only highlights my impatience and lack of understanding. I dunno. But before you can go around saying you know people, you love people, yadda yadda, you've gotta be able to say you love yourself. Stop worrying about how you dislike so-and-so, and how so-and-someone-else is bitchy -- worry how you're heartless, and how you're not compassionate enough. Then, accept it, know yourself, and love the other people for showing you that. The basic human desire is to be understood; the only way for that to start is for you to understand yourself.   Crazy, ne?   Maybe we're all crazy and if we opened our minds to everyone else, then we'd realize it. What'd we do then? Put us all in the crazy bin? Or realize that it doesn't really matter how you perceive reality, long as you're happy? Maybe we're all part of some mass delusion, started by Jesus or some other famous prophet, convincing ourselves that  this  is how the world is, and if you don't think it's so then you're wrong and should be locked up because you're dangerous to society. But isn't all truth dangerous? I'm not saying all the crazy people are prophets, or even right, but just that normality isn't all that important when thinking you're a duck makes you happy.   Don't worry, though. To me, being a duck isn't all that appealing.

      Sorry I haven't written for so long ^^;; In fact, the only reason I'm writing now is because A is making me. Yup. She has much strength and persuasion, even over MSN. *sigh* Whatever.   She's suggesting that I write about the CDs and books I got today. Hmm.. okeedoke! Me and me family went to Futureshop and got a bunch of CDs... I bought two David Usher CDs (older ones), and and an older one by Danny Michel. Yup. I love David Usher especially, though :P he's super cool!!   Then we headed over to Booklore, a small private bookstore that's awesome and always has lots of signings and stuff. I have a book actually SIGNED by George RR Martin!! Isn't that insane?!?! He's like the best author ever, so. Anyway, I got the next two books in the Senet trilogy (by someone I forget -- it's a girl though!!). I hardly even remember the first book, except I DO remember that I liked it a lot and it was a pretty cool idea (something a bout overthrowing a religion). What else... oh! A Discworld book, by Terry Pratchett. Wee Free Men, I think it's called. Terry Pratchett is hilarious. He is to fantasy what Douglas Adams is to science fiction. Except Douglas Adams had a nicer writing style, I think.   Also, my dog rocks. Honestly. She's the coolest thing of all time. And she knows not to bite hard!! When she feels anything tasting remotely like human flesh/skin, she spits it out and freaks out a bit. Unless she's with me, because then she knows it's ok because I'm nice and I don't mind playing rough.    My cousin's coming over for the weekend. This sucks for a number of reasons, but mostly it sucks because she hates me and to be honest I don't like her that much either. However, in order for someone other than me (as I am now broke from the CD splurge (mummy buys the books for me because reading is healthy)(I don't understand how David Usher and Danny Michel aren't healthy, but hey, she's the boss)) to pay for an expansion to a game I really like (Rise of Nations, to be specific), I have to be nice and hang out with her and all. Blah. I think she's 13. This makes her a year younger than N. I still think my cousin looks like an 8-year-old, though.   I have her jelly bellies in front of me. I'm eating these stale things in protest of my mum and sister's dieting and exercising frenzy. So every time I pop one of these candy-gone-rocks into my mouth, I'm thinking "HAH! Take that, you health-nazis!!"   This is the longest pointless post I've ever written ^^;; Well, except for those two or three written during class/after school. Which were insanely pointless but also insanely long, for no reason except that I'm bored. Only difference is that now I'm being forced to; not bored.   PN is ignoring us. I was supposed to start my piano lessons yesterday, but he never called back. I think he might be moving. Have I mentioned how much I love his wife? She is soo cool! She's a paramedic, and used to teach the piano too (which is where they met; they were both teachers in his Studio), and she's super-nice and fun and all that.   And hopefully I'll be starting the harp again!! W00t!! Of course, I don't have a harp, and I'm not sure if RE will let me rent one, so that's no good. I'm hoping I'll foil the 'rents into buying me a nice one from Dusty Strings or something... 31-string, levers on F and B, made of some nice wood like cherry or something... I can dream, right?

      Bonjour, everyone, I am back from my wonderful, rainy trip in Quebec. Wanna know why I'm back two days early? Because the weather was so facking bad we all just got fed up and left.  The Minshall family is a bunch of quitters. Deal with it :D   Mostly I bought jewellery.. *shifty eyes* I'm trying to find the PERFECT RING to replace the one I lost. I haven't actually succeeded yet... but I have found lots of  other  rings that are nice and pretty ^^;; I also have billions of bracelets, too. Cool, ne? I am pleased, to say the least. And a nice cross necklace, too. I haven't turned manic-Christian, don't worry :P The cross has been around a long time before Jesus. Everyone seems to forget that. You know Odin was hanged and nailed upon the Yggdrasil and speared in the side, too? Way before Jesus ever came along? And he was  sacrificing himself , no less! Now does that sound uncannily like plagiarism, or what? He has the coolest nickname ever: Lord of the Gallows. Neat, huh?   YAY LIBERALS WON!!! And I'm not sure -- but didn't the Green Party get a seat? HOLY SHITE was it not just absolutely hilarious / terrifying when the Marxist-Lennonist party was AHEAD in that Mississauga riding?!?!?! My cousins live there... *cries* *falls off chair laughing* *is confused* That was just... strange. In your face, Harper. That's for believing your own press!! He thought he'd get a  majority , the eedjeet. I have no patience for imbeciles.   This election also brings to light why proportional representation would so totally work better than first-past-the-post. Bloc Quebecois had 12% of Canada's vote. They got 54 seats. The NDP had 14% of Canada's vote. They got 19 seats. How is that fair?? grr. Of course the Liberals don't want pro. rep., because then they'd be even worse off than they are now... lol. Least they won, that's all I can say. lol, I saw this sign advertising Harper in Quebec City, and there was some pretty crazy (funny) grafitti: a Hitler moustache, and the words FASCIST scrolled across it. The Frenchies might be voting for an idiot, but at least they know Harper's worse. *big grin*   Among other things... I can't actually see my blog. IE is screwed, and Mozilla, for some odd reason, isn't showing my blog past the song lyrics. Blah. So, if anyone is writing anything on my chatterbox for whatever reason, that's why. And yes, ei is Caleigh. I think I'm worse than A on all counts, BTW ^^;;; Mwahaha! Go screw yourselves if you don't like it! All my friends love me, and people who aren't my friends I really don't care about, to tell ya the truth... hee, and if it wasn't Peter and Timur, I'm sorry =D Although knowing what I know about the two of you, you can hardly blame me for assuming, ne? (even if assumptions are bad) (so I'll apologize for assuming) (but not for assuming it was YOU TWO) (if that makes sense)   Did you know Chateau Frontenac was like its own city?? We stayed at the Auberge St. Pierre, but jeeeez. It was huge. And there were these two cute juggler guys on the first or second night there, too. Which was cool. I think they were students. I still think Montreal is way prettier though; Quebec has a great old town, but outside of that it's pretty normal. Long live Montreal!!   And then we went to... Chevralier or something? Anyway, we stayed at the Richelieu hotel. It was an hour away from an awesome whale-watching cruise, and that was just unbelievable. We saw an insanely huge amount of whales; a blue whale, too, the largest whale in the world and the first sighting of one this season. Woo! Out at sea for 4 hours though... it was damn cold. And the fjord (forget its name) was just beautiful, too. I don't think my da took enough pictures *pouts* He keeps insisting on  people  being in the picture, and I think that's just ridiculous...   We also went to see the St. Anne Gorge (or canyon)? I had no idea my dad was afraid of heights!!! It was hilarious. 3 suspension bridges over some of the worst white water in Canada, in this huge canyon... it was beautiful, and terrifying, at the same time. *shudders* I think we got some good pictures though. And I walked 400+ steps to be I think 9m over the river... *whew* but I beat my dad! Who works out like every weekend! *cheers*   My mum and my sister are doing an exercise and diet regime. I'm in shock. I feel very left out. But also proud, because I will never ever be caught dead eating a grape fruit, you freaks.   Other than that... I love my dog, she's wonderful and the best. I can't speak French for beans but I'm getting better. And I hate sitting in the car. :P A la prochaine!

      I've been thinking some scary thoughts lately. They mostly have to do with how little we know about each other. I mean, if I committed suicide  right now , or murdered  every single person  in my family, nobody would know why. But I could. It's not as if I am so perfect that there isn't some situation, some set of circumstance that wouldn't cause me to do so. My morals aren't so strong; my principles aren't so courageous. My walls could break down one day, and I could go crazy. Only, here it is: it wouldn't be going crazy. It would just be releasing what is already inside of me. And nobody, not even  one person  among you, would understand just what made me do it. It would be entirely different from what I am to all of you, and yet it is still what I am -- I committed the act, after all. You just don't understand why.   Isn't this terrifying? Your best friend, your husband, your child: they are all completely unknown to you. They could be a terrorist, and you wouldn't know. You only know what they choose to show you. I don't care how long you've lived with them, even if you raised them: you just  can't be in their head . The beast is part of us all, and none of us ever know when it'll be released. I could go crazy, but it's not really crazy, it's just a mystery to everyone else. In some ways, the darkness behind our eyes gives us so many gifts -- creativity, genius, imagination, the space for individual thought. But it separates us all. We will never,  ever  truly understand each other. We'll never know why other people do things. We will always be hurt by misunderstandings, we will always have a sense that we are worth something, we will always feel more important and that our problems are the end-all be-all. We can't learn from the mistakes of others, and this is why we are bound to repeat history; we just can't know  why  people do the things they do, and so we can't  change  it. We are limited to the darkness behind our eyes, and that's all there is for us. No matter how smart you are, you only have that darkness to explore, and nowhere else.   And you might say that I would never, ever commit suicide, never, ever become a serial killer. But how do you know that? It is scary, sometimes, how close I am to the uncivilized side of the soul. I can honestly contemplate doing these things; I'm not disgusted by it, I'm not terrified by it. I can see myself doing just that. But what would it help? This, I think, is what civilization really is; the voice of reason that asks how would this solve anything? ...but isn't that, in itself, scary? Because, when it  does  solve something, I might just go out and  do  it -- and would that be civilized or not? I'd like to understand what goes on behind everybody's eyes, and then maybe I'd figure a way out of this. But then I wouldn't be I at all. I'd be Everything.

      Yes, A, there will be another faire next year! The tenth anniversary, too! Yayy! That means they will probably have extra-cool shows and stuff. I am very excited. I hope we can go on the pirate invasion weekend next year, too, because maybe Johnny Depp will be there *big grin*   Well, A described everything rather perfectly. But I know how to describe chronological, and therefore I will tell it all in a chronological manner *another big grin*   First, I got there. We were listening to an awesome CD my sister had made; lots of big rap booms and that kinda thing. People were looking at us strangely. Anyway, we sat there for a while, and I wondered if maybe B and A had gone into the Faire already. Then A appeared, with her wacky Tibetan Tourist bag, and I went "WEEEEE!", hopped out of the car, and did the macarena.   We waited for a while, with a bit of an awkward moment with A's dad, and then B arrived, blonde hair all over the place, and I did the macarena again. In case you couldn't tell, I was kidding about the macarena part. Do you know, I think B is one of the most hyper people I know. I mean, she has good reason to be hyper, what with her lover-boy and all, but I just thought I'd mention that.   Well, after that, we went shopping. Visited all the jewelry shops first, and I got a black velvet choker with a silver cross, and a silver ear cuff with little black jewel-y things. That's actually all I got. Didn't get a ring this year; they don't sell the sweet little undecorated things like they did when I bought my first one. Looks like I won't be replacing my baby Nimrodel :( But that's okay. I'll just name my ear cuff Bernie and we'll be fine and dandy.   We went to all the pointy places, too, and that was cool. I'm really mad they don't let unaccompanied people under 18 to touch the swords and all that, but we did anyway, so that's okay :D hehe. They have some super cool things there! We tried to convince B to buy the letter-opener (we had been joking about that over MSN only a few nights before), but she didn't, the poop. Instead, we only gaped at the swords and the knives, and laughed nervously when the salesman made the jokes about "how dangerous his job was, with the pretties looking at the pretties." lol. He was funny, but I hate it when men try to be flirty with minors, even if it's only in play. It's not funny, and I'm not flattered. Leave me alone!   The jousting was NOT staged! It says so right in the brochure!! It was  really  funny when they started bonking each other on the head with those wooden swords, though. They must end up being really bruised. And the horses were pretty, too. Very big, and smelly. I'm glad we didn't sit too close to the front, lol. The dust made my nose twitch.   We also went to see the Men in Tights, and  I LOVE THEM . Man, they are just awesomely fantabulous! I remember we stalked them last time, hehe, but not this time, because I was too embarassed to talk to them  LAST  year, and I didn't want to go through that torture again. I still like their Romeo and Juliet show best, but Macbeth was pretty good. They say they're family-oriented, but man, do they make some raunchy jokes :P I think they say it's family-oriented because no little kid would get them. Only old people like ME do :D mwahaha. Yes, I'm old. Deal with it!!!!   What else did we do... yes, the lithomancy thing was cool. I also thought it was rather boring. How do you get a head-aching gypsy to leave you alone? No, I don't want to go to Hamilton for the Psychic Convention. No, I'm not coming back next weekend. No, I'm not interested in buying an unlucky black cat. No, I don't want the fingernails you trimmed yesterday. Go away!!! It's just a load of fooey, anyway!!! That's right! You're false! You're a liar! You're a sham! You don't have the frikking third eye, now  silence , mortal! *smites her*   Oh, and yes, those sky-chairs are comfortable. *purrs* I could just sit in those for ages. It's too bad we're not allowed to swing, though. I really think a chair war would be fun :D Except no shoes allowed, of course. I think somebody should invent the Ultimate Book Reading Chair. It'd be somewhat like the sky-chair, except with some sort of book-holder, and maybe even that table me and B were talking about, for laptops and junk. And yes, bopping a drink-holder is fun.   Oh yeah, and the House of Musical Traditions was tons of fun. I still think A should go back with her dad to buy the flute thingamajig. BTW -- tell your dad that my mom is very sorry she didn't speak with him (she just didn't know who exactly he was, in that big group of people you call your family :P). I grooved on the drums, grooved on the harp, considered buying a music book, decided not to because that would be geeky, and then we continued on our Renaissance journey, whoopee. (no cushion).   And finally, the guy playing the dulcimer was  UBER-COOL . That's right, I said uber. You will just have to accept that. I almost wish I bought a CD, but that, too, would have been geeky, so I didn't. He had nice hair. Wonder if it was a wig? Although, it  is  a rule that all guys who attend the Ren Faire have  long hair...   So, all in all, it was a success, despite the fact that there were not as many gothic teenagers that there usually were (probably because we went on the seniors' free day) (which would explain all the gothic seniors, hehe). I am dead tired now, of course, but that doesn't matter. I'm just not used to being with people, lol :P Sociability wears me out, ya know?   That's about it, though. Gotta get back to work. Cyaz.

      Yayyy! I'm excited! :D   Okay, so that's done. What else? My hands are falling off, mostly. I have typed around 6000 words today, and not one concerned my beloved Taj. Nope, it was all those stupid DareARTS stories. Grr! I have a blue rabbit called Blue, a dormouse called Dora and a duckling called Bernie so far. Stupid stupid stupid. I've finished two stories, on my second. That means I've got 7 more to go, including the unfinished one. *sigh* And then, I've got to  rewrite  all these stories for  teenagers . Ahhh! *dies*   They're advertising a job position in the Blogger News thing. That sounds cool. I've always liked how Blogger is friendly and funny and stuff, not all serious. Google sounds like a good company. Of course, I'm sure it's all a sham. I'll bet Google and Starbucks hook up to take over the world. Think they could? Hey, are private armies illegal?   I think that's what I'd do if I ever won the lottery. Buy a private army. Then I'd be like a world power without land. It'd be like my Rise of Nations game all over again :D w00t! That's a good game. I should probably go play it, since I'm bored, and my fingers hurt. This is a hint: never, ever type 6000 words straight. It is painful. I can feel my knuckles loosening as they prepare to fly away even now. *sigh* BLAH!   Oh, and my parents are snoopy :D That's about it. Okeedoke, done. Byee!

      *swoons* I think I'm in love :D If you think you know who I'm in love with, sil-vous-play MSN me and maybe I will tell you that you're wrong. Let this, however, be known: he sent me such a cute anime thing! So yes, I am in love with him because he sent me an adorable anime video. I am loving the video through him, you see. It all makes perfect sense. And did I ever mention that he is very very gorgeous? Like he really is. Like really. Like really really really.   He's smart, too, but that's not nearly as important as the really-really-reallies.   My sister is coming home today with a friend. This makes me mad, because I hate it when her friends sleep over. They are usually shrill, loud and tall. And they insist on banging doors and whispering and giggling, which bugs me. Also, N goes like super-sonic-hyper when friends are over, and just goes... well, best way to put it would be 'chirpy.' It is very unnatural. I'm not used to N being super-sonic-hyper like that; it is strange, and I don't like it. This is why I am mad that she is having a friend over for a sleepover.   Other than that, I've very little to say. I'm going to the renn faire on Sunday, which will be cool. I am wearing a funky hat, but not the one I bought last year there. I'm wearing my Quebec hat. It's cool and I like it. And I'm pretty close to reaching 25,000 words, which will be a happy-sad moment. I have to re-do practically everything in the first two/three chapters *sigh* But that's ok. I'll do that later. For now, I think I am just going to surf on the wave of creativity.   Peace.   heheheehehee...

      I got bored :) Hopefully this one'll last a while, too, because I've gotta tell ya, it is  painful  changing those stupid templates! This means that there will never again be a chatterbox, or links to whatever, or blah blah blah. You guys all know the address anyway :D I am such a lazy bum, but that's okay, because I am a loveable lazy bum. Right? Right???   And by the way, I was serious about sending me $1. That'd be great. ^__^   Please?   Just to try something out...  HEY EVERYBODY! IS THIS REALLY A COOL COLOUR OR WHAT?!
