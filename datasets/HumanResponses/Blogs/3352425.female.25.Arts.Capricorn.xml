      So after weeks of preparing myself for the not big deal baptismal(?)  I had a great day! Let me back track to the events leading up to many smile and lots of love.   The begining Well It was mentioned we should have gregory baptised by my mother nad gradmother teal.  I thought yeah sure whatever and never put a whole lot of thought into it.  Then it came up again, and then my uncle informed me whenthe next baptism services were, so word had begun to spread but well I wasn't doing the chitter chatter. So then I go to church to see if it's well churchy.  Believe it or not it was okay and I was suddenly intriged and thought it would be a really NICE thing to do.  Middle I had to call the parish office, I put it off!  This is a wonderful trait of min and I tend to do this in all aspects of life. Including my son's birth. It took 2 days to induce for god sakes. Anyway back to the events. So finally after hounding I called and low and behold I left a message.  So then it kinda just went on highatis( sp?)  anyway, colin and I disscussed it one evening and it turned into a moral fight.  You don't believe in organized religion why are we doing this blah blah blah. WellI convinced him that it was for our son and not for us.  although I was feeling pressure from all my parents and grandparents. I just though it was NICE and that everyone would be there celebrating our lovely child in the most kind place that I know of. End  Here is where it gets crazy Pasture calls back and we have to go to a metting pre baptism. to go over the book and such. So we make a date and I write it down, life goes on. I need an outfit, my uncle informs me he has one we can borrow. That chapter is finshed for me. Mom buys a bonnet I moan and sit uncomfortable at the fact my boy is wearing soemthing other than a touqe or a baseball hat.  So I say thank you and bring it home, colin rolling his eye then snickering at me, nad gregory i suppose. So my stress level is now rising, this is such a big deal to every one, who's going to make what oh we should have a BBQ of course we will do it here, and I just smile and agree my family has taken over. Lets get the word out so everyone can attend. We go to our meeting at church, twice ina year in the doors of teh lord, he must be grabbing his chest at this point. ( god that is)   We read teh books, and colin is getting ver agitated, we have to rnounce satan  and accpet the ways of the lord into our lives, and promising to do so for our child.This is not going over well for him, because he at this point has no idea what he believes.  Me I am aware that we are in CHURCH and it's about GOD.. So I think nothing of it. we levae after making small talk with some of teh other parents and come home to you guessed it a discussion and colinis furious that i would put into of position where he feels like a liar. Did he think lightening was about to strike. I remind him it's a celbration of our son, and it is a nice thing to do. So it means something to me, and I am excited ( yet stresssed to th max at this point) so he decides to go through with it and attend on my behalf.  The day. I made tons of food which has a lasting smell of garlic all over teh place, including the car.   We pour into the smallest church in the world.  Half of te peopel there are my family. Everyone has come, I feel so proud and nervous. I brought coffee to teh church, terri was munching on a bagel.  There is no grbage so i found one, ahh in teh spooky church basment, terri wmade me go down with her eeeekk.  we rushed up stairs her smacking my bum in suit and then we come up giggling and with people staring at us... opps. So the sermon begins and we sign, well let me tell ya jen mcmillian and terri made those hyms sound liek well not like hyms. Terri informed me that even god blesses little thugs meaning us and my son, who is the happiest baby in the whole church. Terri being godmothe was in her glory. so coems time for baptisms of cranky babies after the lengthy sermon, AMEN.  We are the last to go and we manage to mess it up, we lost teh page and have no idea what to say, we aren't even sitting together.  We make it coem to gether in teh end. So we go up front, I cry terri cries and gregory looks up at the celling and stares inamazement at teh ceiling fan, then grabs the women whom is pouring the haly water over his head and ointing him with smelly oil. She presents him to the church and he acts like he owns the place. I cry and cry and cry... colinand terri are beaming, I look out and see 30 people who love me and my family. MY friends have coem they all ohh and ahh and take pictures of us all. i cary and feel loved I really felt very loved. Then we ate our faces off I opened wonderful gifts on my angels behalf.  The day winds to an end, I am no longer stressed and exhausted. i have cried all day. Feeling so happy that my baby never cried when all the others did, he loked in wonder at tthe many faces,a nd many strangers who held him and kissed him today. He laughed, he cuddled, and he was a true prince. Now he is sound a sleep. I am wide awake feeling over emotional at teh wonder of my son.... my son  I have this wonderful baby boy who touches the hearts f many at 5 months. How lucky are we to have this in our life. For teh first time ever I know what it is to be blessed Mama

      So here I am at the computer typing out another days events.  I often wish I was opening a word program to finish the masterpeice of teh book I have written, but unfortuanatley it is daily events instead.  I really feel teh creative juices flowing however, it's a matter of making them work into a peice of writting that is publish worthy, I amy hae to stick to children non fiction articles for now. I feel as if my book has to do a little more resting before it's ready for a reveal.    As for now my little man gregory is becoming very aware of his world, it's amazing to watch him take everything as new.  This week he has discovered his toes, how they look feel, and taste. he now curls up in a ball and use his hands and feet to tackle and toys or anything around him.  Oh and the smiles you should see the smiles.  I have such a happy child. Minus nap time however he wakes up laughing. I just hope it's not at me, a litle early for that yet.  I bought him a new toy, that is supposed to be a long eared dog with multi colors for all and when you pull him he extnds and then shkaes back into place, gregs new game is pulling letting go shriking and doing it again, he is now comentaring thsi post, i asured him he's been mentioned more than once,  Oh and here comes my reward. A big smelly poo... wooo the wafting and gruntting has uexpectenly hit my nostrils. well the smell not the sounds. So while he is finishing up his poo poo I will sign off this post. Colin is chainsawing away in teh back yard. clearing away small tree so we can see more of our brook.  I can not wait to create a little oasis back there. Tanya will hardly recognize the home we bought only a year ago!! Well i better head off to well change the little stink bum.  wish me luck  Until tomorow or soon after  love jenn

      WELL TODAY IS A SUNNY DAY HERE IN NS. I enjoyed teh day with colin, and baby greg, looking a lawn stuff and things for teh garden.  We picked up a few CD's new linken park, hooba stank( I love) Smashing pumpkin hits, and thornbey, was recomended. I actually really  like it, I still want to pick up finger 11, default and JET. Anyway the flies started to eat me and greg, so he went for a nap and now i am typing away at teh compter, writing this wonderful blog, which I am becoming addicted to it very easily thanks tan.   I think later I will have to begin soem work on my childrens lit assignment, and read one of my many books which i have just recently purchased. Before i settle into relax I ma going to head off to good ols wally word, drop off my film, and print off a large van gough picture to hang my wall. Art has become my new obsession.     Do you how relaxing it is to just sip away on some pink lemonade with all windows open, play some music and enjoy the nice weather, an d having time to enjoy it. I have to say all is well in life today. Financal difficulties or not!! well I am now off to start the rest of my relaxation process. I hope everyone else is enjoying the day in some way shape or form. Mamma

      Well we had a little bit of a drunk fest here last night.  I was taking care of gregory so i got to watch teh drunks get smashed over a period of a few hours and laugh. Then when gregory went to bed I got lit up little a small christmas tree. Just enough light to feel a little off this planet .  I woke up to colin throwing up at 4 am which made me giggle aswell. Well today we get rain, damp and chilly. Colin and I have decided to watch season 4 of teh sopranos. We're a tad addicted to watching dvd after dvd these days. since we are both not working reading diapers, formula, house cleaning and TV has become our new friends. Well thats all today, oh gregory tried to have a conversation with our big cat ben, gooing and gagging at him, then sqealing with delight. He makes me grin like it's christmas morning every day.

      Well here it is may and I am sweating it's great!!  Gregory whom is now 4 months has on his new orange blue and yello summer sleeper, that i got for a steal at walmart. 3.94$ I must add!! Tonight we are having a small BBQ to celebrate nice weather and our new almost completed renovations.( AKA the new BAR)  So I wish tanya could be here because I miss her and because she can really appreciate all the renovations, since she saw the shell before it became a beautiful home. I just made teh best pasta salad, with pesto, yummmyyy. wow my thoughts are all over teh place. yikes I better get my self grounded here so I can start making soem sense, and watch my spelling mishaps.  Colin is out on our deck enjoying a beer and teh sun. The birds are singing away in teh background, it kinda looks like a commercial. Well I have to thank tanya for this site because if not for her i would not be here rambling on. Did I mention Gregory sat up in his swing yesterday, he is so very cute!! I have to say I really love being a mommy it's incredable and there really are no ways to describe it!!! By for now Jenn

      I totally wrote a huge ass blog last night and boom.... I logon today to read eveyone elses and it's puff gone.. by bye. weird. Ahh well an excuse for me to write another I suppose. So I think I may be on the ban wagon about the new fad of.. yup scrapbooking. well it's not an overlly new fad, but is to me. I adore it!  The little pictures you get, the sayings and the paper.. ohhhh the paper. Fun fun.   I have started one about gregory while i was prego, haven't gotten far at all but I have all teh supplies. Old man time sometimes needs to make a few days strech out more.  Colin started his new job today. he left and came back 3 times before he actually hit teh highway. i think he was a tad nervous about having everything he needed. Iam so happy for him though. Imean money is getting tight with 3 weddings, one standing, one giving and thenmy own. Who can afford that. I may even need to get a loan.. eeek  Ahh well it would be all worth it though. anyway this blog ssucks.. i have nothing after last night and i can't even remeber what I went on about.  I'll make soem tea play with baby, call home outfitters to register for my wedding.. and go for a walk. Don't get lost in teh interest of this blog for god sakes.

      wow my little man is amazing.  He really is my world !! What did I do before him?  I mean he is wonderful!  he is starting to reach for me and touch and study my face with his hands.  I am really begining to feel like mommy can cure all. Like when he bumps his head while attempting to crawl, or when he gets frustrated during his belly time because he can't reach something. Or when he gets scareed all he wants is mommy or daddy Ilove it.  I feel so useful, and proud all at once I really love it.    Right now he is drink his bittle playing with his hair( what hair he does have) and looking around at allof his surroundings. every now and again he stops and stares at me with his big beautiful eyes.  Now  he is getting sleepy and will soon want to cuddle. I can not compare anything to that.  It is so little so every day, and even sometimes frustrating, but when I stop and soak it all up it's like WOW. Look at what love created. Look how beautiful and innocent new life is.  I have all the tools to mold and care for this little being. My son.  Oh god I am soo going to cry! Bye I need a tissue.

Gregory is getting so big, it really amazes me how each month is well so fullof new things. He is a growing boy, fullof mischief just waiting to get out.  I really think i am in for a comedin here. He has this little quirky side to him at 5 months. crazy crazy crazy.  He tries to choke himself with various objects all the time now.  I really have no stress in my life really I think I should umm do something to add more stress to my life, here it can help you loose weight. ha ha Justjoking here folks, if you can't laugh at life your missing out on how humerous it all is. No Sun today, good ole nova scotia rain. headache weather. and wouldn't you know I do have a headache.  The only time I didn't was when I went tanning. ahh the only 11 minutes of my day I just go somewhere else. How I love it so!   So tonights the big hockey night, in celebration of teh flames, we are having some munchies and inviting Andrew Higgins over for a visit.  Yes gals me and all the men,( colin, gregory, and andrew) I might just have to brag about this one.  Now if they all gave me presents and rubbed my back and fed me grapesI would be in pure heaven.. instead I am looking after teh baby ( waiting for teh daily poo to show itself)  making wings and trying not to munch to much and watching gulp a full game of hockey.  Wow I am in heaven. Why didn't soemone let me know. He hee. Gregory is doing something ver sill y with his toungue. It's as if he discovered soemthing new to do with it. This is entertainment for hours for me, I will have to video tape it.

      poor gregory is just drooling away on a ribbion I gave him from liz kyles wedding invitation, Liz I am sorry he just was enjoying it so much.  I am watching him like a hawk so he doesn't shove it down the trap. Okay now I got nervous and took it from him, he's wiling for his dangerous friend to come back , and is making little 5 month old eyes at me, not sure if it means comfort me or you hateful bitch.  okayhe's over it.  the poor man is now grabbing at everything. if  he can't get it into his mouth, is a huge deal. i thinked he has paved his road to future behaviour problems.   greg is also teething and wants  to massage his little gums as much as possible. if i could only feel what it was like. poor guy. i will finsh up later my man needs a nap.....

      Well It seems nice and sunny out again today. This is really teh best part of teh day because nothing has really warmedn up and it's a half decent temperature in and outside the house.  I love teh sun, but honestly the heat has got me wishing a lived in water like a dolphin, or at my current weight a small whale.     I feel for teh little gregory aswell, I mean he gets so agittaed and uncomfortable their is really nothing I can do except throw him in his baby hide away pool untill his lipps begin to chatter.  Although I know I am lucky as even when he is agitated by teh heat he rareley gets overly cranky, more like annoyed.  He's such a good boy.  He is now up on hands and knees bouncing in spot. All it takes is for him to move a leg or an arm forward and he may figure out it will move him, iT's really cute to watch though. He looks so proud of him self.  I think I may have to remember that look when he is crawling and causing terror on our little home.  He already laughs at me when I tell him no.  It's a good thing he doesn't really dooo anything yet, he has no idea how mommy can bring down the hammer. So at this point he's pretty lucky too.      The hosue is already warming up, I went downstairs and I hit a heat wall while coming back up stairs, won't be long now until everyone is dragging their bums around trying to get cool. Al except colin that is. Now taht he returned home at 7 am from his  12 hour night shift, poor guy had to drive with the window down for an hour so he wouldn't drift off( this makes me un easy by teh way) He is nestled in bed trying to catch soem much needed sleep and the rest of the world is alive and  hot!  I hope he doesn't have to pull alot of those shifts as they are so hard to adjust to.  I remember when Tanya sloan worked swing shift and her world was upside down for a year. ( sleep wise)  Poor guy.It's hard to beacuse he won't see gregory until 3:30 or later this afternoon, then He may have to go back to owrk depending on if they call him in or not! Ahh well he is working and we will have more money now, but I do miss him 12 hour shifts are long. Well enough of my mindless babble I should get up and going here, I realy want to go back to sleep but the truth is hello good morning, a new day is here!

      The sacle .......... teh number was to say teh least a last straw.So here it is I am laying it down liek this.... i saw me in a very pretty bridesmaids dress and teh secret is out. I look huge not just huge grandmunguos.&nbsp; So I have 3 months what teh hell am i going to do to loose weight in three months.&nbsp; I really have to figure soemthing out here. I can never be satisfyed with me in MY wedding dress looking the way I do now.&nbsp; It's like hard core.&nbsp; I can not beleive the way I looked and yes this is negative and I promised my self I wiouldn't let it take over my life, but ignoring my weight isn't helping either. i feel so large, so disgusting and yes yes unpretty. Horrible for one to admit but so very true. I am actually worried about my health. my lack of energy and being tired and lazy. That is no way to live a life. I was doing great 3 months ago with body image and everything but now well now I really need to get back into that and make it work for me!!! Because my current situtaion is well making me feel pretty damn bad about myself. Veggies water and excersise it worked when i first had teh baby and i will make it work again.  &nbsp; Jennifer Marie Miller I challenge you to a victory only you can win and only you cna benifit from.  Think of gregory and how he will see you,and how fustrated he will be if you can't participate in activities because of your weight!!!!!!!!!

      So I have had a bit of allergy since Gregory was born( all of 6 months ago) It was getting better but today uh uh. hello full force sneezing, ichy red watery eyes, post nasal drip which comes out whenever it pleases like a little fawcet. Drip drip drip. I sound stuffed alllll the time, and every day soem one says ooh you have a cold. When I sniff it sounds like a mating call for some rare species of mamal.  It's horrib;e.  I finally have an apointment to go see Dr R on friday. I really need allergy tests done. It is something I am around everyday, adn to be honest it can not be seasonal because it started in Jan. The other day my noistrles cleared enough so i could identify garbage  and flowers.  One nostril is always clear when gregory poops too. It's liekmy body is playing a wicked joke or something. argghhh     On a happy note, tanya will be here in 4 days including today. I am sossosoooo excited to see teh sloanster. It's been a year, way too long and I nee her to hug and laugh and cry and just be tan. I miss her little ways, after living together for a year,it's like all the little things are more important hen every before and I really miss her silly antics,a nd late night talks with chcolate and tea, and movies and well everything okay. Sooo do I sound likea stalker??????  Hee hee Blush blush blush. Gregory has begun to fus fuss fuss I think it is his teeth but no pearly whites yet. When I leave him for a few he has a new whine.. and it was ahh cute at first but now..  arggghhhh  yesterday though he was in his chair asleep and we were at home depot buying tile for grandmas floor and he woke up and colin and I weren't in immediate sight, and he must have saw the unfamiliar soroundings and got scared. teh cry that came out of him was enough to break my heart. I had to scoop him up and snuggle until we left to go home. Ohh He is such a mamas boy. Well now that I lost precious sleep time due to teh allergy suffering I must try to hit the hey before therest of the house gets up in and hour and ahalf. Who am I kidding no sleep for me until 10 pm or 11 pm tonight.. joy joy joy.

      I can post but cannot read.. how very strange.   So here I am at 2:01 in teh am worring again about money. It's just paper.. make more.  I am starting to want to go back to work but not my old job, but a bright fancy new one. I have to say I feel un- qualified as a regular working woman  these days. I have to be honest I feel a bit lost. Colin doesn't start traing for our local youth jail until teh 12, there fore our increase in wages will probably not start until after that. poopy seeing as we are broke now!!!! heehee..    I actually got out of my comfy little bed and wrote a letter to ma and pa, asking for a loan of some sort.  I do not know what to do here. Money is the root of all evil you know. getting by day by day, worrying about everything.  I mean we will be okay but man it just never lasts.. when the going gets good, it disapers in less than a blink. There is however solace in my son where, he is so innocent and just acts on his emotions minute to minute. He has no real worries. It's nice to have that. Although I wish I was on teh recieving end of that deal.    Also I have been writing kids stories and well all is at a loss this week. perhaps teh stress. Well I better stop my moaning and groaning and try to figure out how to view this thing!! Then maybe I should consider going  back to bed now theres a nice thought! Mama
