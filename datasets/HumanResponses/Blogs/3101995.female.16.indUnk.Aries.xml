      hey! well im sum wut grounded i guess. my mom never told me if im still grounded or not cuz shes letting me on the comp. more and all that fun stuff now so thats good. i just got back from my cuzinz house in federal way. that wuz cool cuz i hung out w/them today and i went to the mall also (fun fun i guess), im a pretty boring person who prolly shouldnt be keeping a blog but anywayz. my friend jd iz in cali (not fair) my other friend iz in las vegas (sooo not fair) and like a lot of my other friendz r in freakin DC or NY (sum school trip but it wuz kinda expensive). so im stuck w/barely anyone to hang out w/. well at least my bf iz leaving to go sumwhere. but hez leaving in june or somethin like that to go to Norway to visit relativez (i wish i wuz going too) but yah...... ok ive run out of thingz to talk/write about...thiz iz really sad well im gonna go * hug~kayce *
