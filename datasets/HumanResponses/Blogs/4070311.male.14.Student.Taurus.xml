Father Lord in Heaven, I come before You Lord to pray for all those people out there Lord. That Lord, You will guide them and give them the wisdom that they need for this period, while they have their common test in school Lord. Father that You will give them good health so that they will be able to pass the test with flying colours Lord. Father i pray that you will remove all the distraction that comes before them Lord. Father that through this Lord, that they might be able to glorify your Holy Name Lord. I thank You Lord, in Jesus' name, AMEN!   Good luck for your test guys! study hard!

Anyway .... after the national celebration hor.... i went back to my oLd sKoOl ....

After visiting and stuff like that, Yiheng, chubby and I went to fEnGshAn CC and have lunch.... afTer lunch, chubby and I went to the playground and chat about things that happened recently while Yi heng went to play sOccer .... After chatting for about 1 hour, chubby wanted to come to mah house. so he came lor. Den hor.... we tok tok and tok. Den, he went to see my hamsters. After seeing and playing wif them for awhile, one of my hamsters died ! that hamster was from a friend of my mom. She gave it to her recently only.... and after 1 or 2 months, it died! anyway .... had oikos at night. Very little people came. But, its alright. Cuz, in God's eyes, He doesn't see by the number of people that is around us, beside us, or wherever they may be. But, by the faith that we have in him. bLeAhx .... btw hor .... i can't realli use the computer these few days. Because of the nearing common test. So, if i can;t update my blog, realli SORRY! alright. Stop here for today. Take care and God bless u.   *Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.

       Yox ! its sundae...! wheE~ hahax .... today, i was out whole day man ! from 8.30 - 11.30! wahaha ... 15 hours out ! lolx.... lets start frm daa mornin. Alright... i Was SupPose to WakE up At 7am for mY tuition at dhoby Ghaut at 9am ... but Woke up at 8.20~! i was late ! i sms-ed my tuition teacher and told him that i wasn't able to make it for the tuition... so, i went to bathe lor.... after bathing, i called yi heng to find out bout wad time to meet in church and stuff... so i am to reach church by 9.00 for Bible study.... followed by the Main Service in the sanctuary. btw ... my church ish Bethesda Cathedral .... daa big and white Church tt looks like a Castle! lolx ... back to my story ... Before mAin servIce startEd, We SaNg WoRship Songs like, " one way, Days of Elijah and many many more songs " These songs realli made me think about God and His purpose of bringing me into this Earth that we are in. by The wAy, in the weeks Bulletin, there was this  sign-[NO GOSSIPING] that struck me. it was like... i have been gossiping about people these few days! Is God trying to speak to me? so, I have decided that since God doesn't want us to gossip about other people... why not juz follow his commands? So guys ... if u see me gossiping hor.... remind me not to gossip alright? wahaha. aNd During tHe main service, Pastor talked about the Healing annoiting upon our church. That during the time of Jesus, Jesus sent 12 people to went out and heal everyone that is blind, sick, crippled and many more. etc. aT tHe eNd of the mAin service, Pastor called out for those hu has pain in the leg for healing... and surprisingly, there was a lot of people with pain in the leg ! there was like 15 of them! And after Pastor prayed, almost one third of them was healed! PRAISE THE LORD! After main service, Auntie Hwee Phen brought us out for lunch at cafe cartel .... was raining den. ... so the atmosphere wasn't there. =( . But, It was still a lunch that i enjoyed. =) ... During youth service, We split up into classes to ask if we had any difficulties while trying to share Christ with our friends... although i did not hav any qns, i learnt alot from there... After youth service ended, it was Gordon's audition for music ministry as a DruMmer ! keWlz coolz... haahx ... he played not bad..... But he was so shy that he wanted everyone to go out of the room except himself and timothy cheng. wahahax .... but .... we crawled back into the room to see him play! wahahahax... the best part was when we open the door soo big and he did not even notice the door open. lolx .... Anyway , something sad happened after that. its better that i don't tell about it. soMething that is not associated to me.... but i veh kaypo ... lolx..... wahh! i write until sooo long! wahaha.... okiex .... think that i'll stop till here. Continue tml.   bUhbYeZ!~   God loves all of us inspite of how bad and evil we are.   tAke cAre ~
