      Let's see, today I worked (been doing that a lot lately), and I'm planning on working through Friday, too.  On Saturday, though, I'm taking some friends to Austin for day of climbing at Reimer's Ranch, and swimming in the Pendernales.  The tree swing is awesome.  It'll be a great way to cool off in the afternoon when the sun is directly overhead.  I get to play climbing teacher again, but that doesn't bother me too much - I'm hoping to grow my pool of available climbing partners so that one day I can actually start progressing in the sport again.  I can't wait for  urlLink Misty  to get her harness off the slow boat from China.  She's got quite the body for climbing.    The rain's supposed to have stopped dumping in Austin this afternoon, so I'm sure it'll dry out quickly, but damn have we had a lot of rain.  Don't get me wrong, I love the rain (and I'm not ready for the blistering days of summer, thankyouverymuch), so I don't want it to go, but I also don't want it to come around so much.  On a whim, I tuned into an internet radio station streaming punk.  See, I usually listen to trance/techno/house, as do most of the people I know who write software for a living (commentary on  that  vocational adaptation I'll leave for another post), so it follows that I wasn't programming this afternoon...  and we'll leave it at that.    I ought to end this post right now, but the reggae station, "playin' mostly marley mon'", was definitely worth a mention.

      Maybe you were wondering about the title of this blog.  See, I'm a huge fan of trance, techno, vocal trance, progressive trance, and house music. I stream  urlLink Digitally Imported  radio from the time I get to work in the morning till the time I go to sleep at night.  Now click  urlLink here .  Got it? Good.

      I've seen enough failed promises from people on the Internet, saying that they'll do this or that - I mean, have you ever tried to work on an Open Source project?  urlLink Quod erat demonstrandum .  Anyway, someone I trust a whole lot says it's totally addicting, and a good idea.  So, I guess I'll try it out for a few days.  I figure, sure, I'm a bit of an exhibitionist, so this fits right in.  The great thing about exhibitionism is that you get your thrills even if no one sees you.  It's just that the opportunity was there.  So that's my way of saying, leave a comment if you want. Or not, no worries.  No promises though.

      For anyone that happens upon this site, let it be known that I didn't  want  to start a blog so much as I wanted to post a comment to another Blogger's blog, but the registration process involved setting up my own blog.  So here it is.

      Finally, I'm awake. I went out to Northgate last night with some friends, so yes, there was consumption of alcohol. The cops were out like I'd never seen before, and folks were getting MIPs left and right. Pretty crazy. Early on, Kyle and I hit up the convience store for some cigs, and when we came back there were these two girls sitting with our group. Apparently, they were sisters, and of course, one was cute. So there Kyle and I are talking to the cute one, and everyone is having a good laugh. What's so funny? Oh, just that she's FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. Stupified, we needed a drink, so it was off to New York Sub for $2 chuggers. When we got back we all had a lot of fun laughing about it.  Let's see, I ran into a girl from a past ski trip - she's going sky diving today. I attempted to get an invite to come along, but apparently you've got to reserve seats on the plane ahead of time. I had nothing better to do today, so why not jump out of a plane? Oh well, maybe next time.  I ran into another pair of sisters, one of whom I've known for a long time.  Yes, they are  old enough to drive , but not old enough to drink. The one I knew had gotten herself an MIP. We hung out for a while, I ran into some more old friends. I got her number, maybe we'll keep in touch this time.  Around closing time, we decided that we were hungry, so it was off to MickyDees for burgers and fries of various heart-clogging obesiety-inducing flavors. Unfortunately, what we didn't know, was that it was African-American appreciation night. Probably every black person in College Station was there. Now, being a progressive on race relations, I was all for going in, but the girls in the car vetoed that idea. We ended up at Whataburger, and you'd think that was safe from vocal, possibly mililitant, minorities right? Wrong, gay appreciation night at the Whataburger. I'm sorry, but some gay men look completely stupid; I know my fashion sense is bad, but who  really  thinks turned up collars on pink polo shirts on round gay men with spiky hair is sexy? Thankfully, tonight it was Kyle, and not myself, that got hit on. We all had a good laugh at the "well aren't you a pretty boy?" comment he received.  And then I drove home, turned on the chillout stream from di.fm, and went to sleep. 568 minutes of ambient/psychedelic/chillout trance later, I'm posting this, and damnit, I forgot to record the stream. *sigh*  It's a beautiful day outside, so I'm going to go play.

      I'm hit on by gay men all the freakin' time. I just wanted a steak omlette and some pancakes, not some unessecary attention from a waiter who thinks I'm cute. Thanks, but I'm not even sitting in your section of the restaurant! Just for the hell of it, one of these days I might even lead one of these guys on. Hmmm, I must be feeling evil today. Oh, and I think of Misty everytime it happens, and I'm like, "shit, did I catch gay-magnetism or something from her?" Which is an admittedly funny, but ultimately pretty fucked up legacy for your ex to leave you.  But, ya know, the pancakes were pretty tasty.  The steak omlette, not so great.

      Coming back from lunch, I ran into our VP, he said, "Hey David, building good things for us?" I thought that was pretty funny.  Of course, the strong margarita I'd had 15 minutes prior at Chiptole probably made it funnier that it really was.  I think I'll go out drinking tonight, I'm feeling pretty nice right now.

      Both of my shoulders hurt today, but the right one really hurts.  I think I aggravated it by climbing on it yesterday (duh).  It's the rotator cuff.  I need some ibuprofen.    Oh well, it'll heal.    Despite my shoulders, Wednesday at the wall kicked ass, just a bunch of old farts like me indulging our addictions.  A great community.  I ran into Ashley and Jamie who I haven't seen since last fall. And I on-sighted a 5.9, which felt great. I think I'll be back up to climbing 5.10 in a few weeks.  Then maybe I'll pull out the lead ropes and start that quest again.  And if I do end up moving to Raleigh, I'll have all of that at my vertical disposal.    Anything else going on? Well, I met a couple really cool girls, and I've been talking to each of them pretty much every night this week, hence the lack of updates.  It's been a whole lot of fun, that's for sure.    Oh, last thing before I go to lunch, I was invited to go climbing at Enchanted Rock on August 13-15.  I'm going to do a couple of multi-pitch routes.  I've never done multi-pitch before; I'm really excited, but a bit nervous.  It's entirely possible that I could fall and die.  Hooray for danger.

      Saturday, Saturday, what did I do on Saturday?  You know, it's funny, I sat down to write about this weekend, and now I can't remember what I did on Saturday. Oh well, on  Sunday , I visited A&M Church of Christ.  I didn't make it in time for the service, but caught the college class instead.  The  a cappella  worship was really lovely, but the guy who delivered the message seriously rambled from here to Kentucky and back.  Presumably, he wanted to talk about what the Bible says about judging others, and I guess he made a few good points (like, don't give destructive criticism, like say, in the form of a personal ad directed against your ex who, despite the reality, you're still in love with - an amazingly concrete example *wink*), but it really didn't ring my bell. Ya know?    Ok, now it gets interesting.  I got a good hair cut - if you know me, then you'll know that it's always been a shot in the dark to get a good cut.  I dropped $80 on a webcam, then I set up daveshottyparadise.com so that I can "perform" and whatnot for kinky fun and profit (cha-ching!).  Just kidding, but I did get a webcam, and I had a whole lot of fun making silly recordings of myself and taking pictures.  I enjoyed watching the lighting flash, the thunder roar, and the rain fall cleaning my car (whoop) and washing away all chances of getting to swim in the outdoor pool (hiss).  Then, of course, I went up to the Rec.  I was really happy with my climbing; I was able to complete a number of different routes that I was struggling with last week.  Kinda disappointed in the lap pool though, my joints felt really close to hyperextending on almost every stroke.  Maybe I'm just paranoid about another knee injury.  Oh, and I've gained about 10lbs since going on my diet which is awesome, the extra muscle was really helping me climb better.  Physically, I'm feeling pretty confident.  Maybe my mind's playing tricks, but I think I've noticed more people checkin' me out.  Sweet.    Emotionally, I'm pretty blank.  Definitely not depressed or sad or anything like that, and definitely happier on average, but still pretty disappointed that the best thing to come into my life is now gone.  Knowing that I have no grounds for pity (see also: caricature urlLink  ), well, that leaves me feeling blank.  I'd like to reconcile, but that's going to be on your terms.  And there's still the matter of the story I'm writing about you.  I'm trying to paint the most clear picture of how I understand you from what I know about you; I hope you'll find it revealing and appreciate it.  Who knows though? Who can say?    Oh, now I remember, I saw a matinee showing of "The Bourne Supremacy" on Saturday.  That movie is so incrediably cool - you've got to check it out.  It's coming back to me now, I woke up early and paid my bills online (still have to pay utilities - don't forget dave!), talked to my mom for about an hour.  I love my mom, I told her about the caricature and she didn't rip me a new one. Her birthday is today.  Happy Birthday, Mom.  I talked to a business partner of mine, and I may (read:  may ) be moving to Raleigh, North Carolina and get paid a generous salary to work on a number of different projects.   I finished up the night chatting on the IM with someone.   So, Saturday wasn't as action-packed as Sunday, but still pretty enjoyable.    That's my weekend, I hope you had a good one too.

      I owe it to you to create something which isn't a caricature like the other thing was.  It's coming together in my mind, but it's going to take a little more time to create - not because it's hard to come up with things, but because there is so much.  I don't know if you even visit my deserted streetcorner anymore, but I hope so.

      Uppers:  Finally doing the right thing when I got an emergency phone call (ie stop whatever you're doing and go)  Indirectly letting someone know how much of an asshole he is.  Seeing in her eyes that she did care about me.  Getting to the Rec in time to climb.  Adequately explaining my point of view in person.  Looking forward to spending a long time creating a portrait of your good side.  Deleting the post completely.    Downers:  Seeing her brokenness and rage.  Seeing the tears run down her face.  Knowing that I hurt you.  Knowing that I will never match your ideal.  Not pulling that 5.8 as cleanly as I used to be able to do.  Knowing that my dreams will torment me tonight.    Hopefuls:  I know you agree with some of those things.  I hope you can use it to better yourself.  Getting back down to par climbing.  Hoping to meet your impossible ideal in a dark back alley one day.    Funnies:  Imagining you smashing those $50 flowers with those $100 tiki torches is actually kind of funny. But then I imagine your tear-stained face, and I'm ashamed. I'm sure you'll be amused to know that I've yet to pay those off my credit card.    I leave myself open to you.  I will put up no defense.

      It's 3:15pm, the day is almost over! I'm so looking forward to going home. I picked up the latest Rock &amp; Ice last night for some evening reading at Coffee Station. This month's training section is pretty interesting. No surprise here, but I'm hungry for Fazoli's.    I'm beginning to see the things that I used to ignore or excuse.

      1:30 - I went to Fazoli's first. The girl wasn't there, but I got a nice chicken parmisan anyway -  free breadsticks! sweet!     2:10 - I'm at Academy Sports getting new toys. $150 well spent. Whoop!    3:00 - I'm at the Rec for some climbing fun. It's a good day, I meet up with another David for some bouldering and top rope action. I'm feeling good, I'm moving well, not enough power yet, but I'm rusty and I'm working on that.    5:00 - I'm in the pool? Doing laps? Ok, so, I did plan to do laps after I climbed, but it's been about two years since my pool injury, so it's odd. But great! I'm swimming in the outdoor pool, Sun on my back, feeling the cool water flow over my body. Breath, stroke, kick, breath, stroke, kick. It's amazing.    6:00 - I'm in the locker room, and I check my messages. It's Aaron. I bet he wants ... yep ... he wants to go climbing. Well, why not, I've got a day pass! I stroll back out to the wall, and he and Leann are there. Aaron moves like the 6' 6" 220 lbs of struggling mass up the wall that he is, but the guy is tenacious - props. Leann moves like the 5' 6' 120 lbs that she is, like a cat, methodical, balanced, and smooth. And we climb till close. And it's awesome.    10:00 - We are dog tired from climbing for four hours.  I've been at the Rec since 3:00.  So, let's go to IHOP!    10:30 - The biggest omlete I've ever seen is lying before me. I devour it. Happily. Mmmm. We talk about weight-training, food, school, work, horror stories about breakups - just good times. The fact that I'm not in school and working fulltime doesn't phase these people one bit. I really appreciate that. Both of them are about my age, graduating in a couple semesters, moved around, have loans, jobs, and all that. And I love it. What a great day!    11:45 - I'm home. I finally check my messages. Looks like grampa is doing ok now.  Still kind of weak though.   Final tally? 65 minutes of bad against 460 minutes of good. Day's a winner. Collect your prizes at the door.    I'm gonna sleep sooooooooooooooooooooooooo well tonight.

      Last night I saw "I, Robot". Very cool, go see it! Afterwards I remembered that today would be Sunday and that I wanted to go to church. I had some old roommates who went to A&amp;M Church of Christ, and so I thought, "Self, why not?". I pulled out my Yellow Pages, and I had the address "1901 Harvey Mitchell South College Station". So far so good, and I went to sleep.    In the morning, I drove directly to 6 and 2818 to A&amp;M Church of Christ, only it wasn't A&amp;M Church of Christ, it was Brethern Church, so turned around and began searching 2818 for this church which I had no idea where it was, and it was 10:25, and service started at 10:30. Finally, I pull into A&amp;M Church of Christ's parking lot at 10:35, but what's this? It's abandoned!    C'mon! This is like the 4th Sunday in a row I've tried to go to any church, and it's closed or no service or whatever. I'm not having any of this, so I drive around looking for any church that isn't Peace Lutheran on 2818. That leaves Friend's Congressional Church and First Baptist Church. Well, Friend's service has obviously already started, so that was out - and First Baptist didn't start till 11:00. It's about 10:40 now. I really don't want to wait, maybe Peace will work, I think to myself.    Will that person be there? There is a small chance so, but I can sit in an unlikely place and we won't run into each other. Ok, so I pull into the parking lot just as my Low Fuel light turns on. Ok God, I'll go in. I'm sitting watching people enter and none are bringing in Bibles. Odd. Should I leave mine in the car? I'm already kind of nervous, so I take it along for peace of mind. Walking in I know that a Lutheran church does things very differently from a Baptist church, so I walk up to the greeters and introduce myself hoping that they might explain anything which I might need to know - like where the secret hymnals are or how to get the brochure. But they neglected to point those out, so I went and sat in a pew. And waited.    And the service starts, a casual glance around fails to uncover the person, and I relax a little - it'll be all right, I tell myself, even without the special hymnal or a bloody clue as to what's going on the service picks me up and I'm feeling at ease.    The second song starts, don't ask me what it was. I decide that at the end I'm going to ask the lady to my right where she got the hymnals so that I can participate. Yeah that's a good plan. The lady to my right. Yeah. That's the ticket. Yeah. WHAT THE HECK!??!?! OH MAN I AM SO SCREWED! LOOK, THIS ISN'T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. Guess who is coming down this pew, and stands right next to me on my right.    Oh if I wasn't a bundle of nerves before I am now. The song ends, and so I gently asked, "Miss, where'd you get that hymnal?" short, terse, quick, with a hint of pissedoffedness came spoken response "In front," and the unspoken response very clearly being  what the hell are you doing here?  and I'm thinking, "Geez, I didn't come here to see you, I thought you were out of town,  why are you here ? Why did you come and sit  right next to me ? Why didn't you go sit  over there  where you sat before? This could have been easy, but now it won't be."    So I scoot over a bit and put a good two feet in between us, out of range of any covert kicks, punches, or whacks, and try to just focus on the service. And oh goody, it looks like - surprise surprise - they're going to do Communion today. If you know me, you'll know that lately, whenever I go to any church they have Communion on that day. It's ridiculous. In a Baptist church like the one I grew up in, you have Communion at most once a year. So it's a special event. Like Easter or Christmas. But the churches around here must be going through bread and wine at a phenomenal rate. Or maybe God's just letting me catch up.    Ok, so I want to take Communion, but if I do I know I can't be angry at the person next to me. In fact, I was never angry, just a little scared (and wouldn't you be? she's got nails and scary hair and gets in mosh pits and could probably kick my ass right there in church and if people got upset about the commotion in the back row she could just point at me and say "ER" and everyone would just go back to praising God, or something, did I get a little carried away there?). Oh well, nothing I can do about that now. So I pray extra hard during the prayers, and focus extra well on the baptism and sermon, and when it comes time for the food, I take it in rememberance of Him. And I like it.    Oh this is great. I actually enjoyed the service. A lot. &lt;sarcasm&gt;Fantastic.&lt;/sarcasm&gt; I'm so screwed. How's this going to work out? I'm not Lutheran, I didn't grew up Lutheran, I don't know a thing beyond what I picked up in the service about them, I couldn't find their secret hymnals, and someone who doesn't want me here is here and actually knows the words to the random incantations spoken from the congregation seemingly at random throughout the service.    It hurts when I think about losing you. It hurts to think of you with someone else. I try not to think about that too much.  I have to stay busy.  There are other girls.    I'm hungry. I'm jittery. I'm going to Fazoli's to see if the girl with the nice smile (Russ said she thought I was cute! I feel like I'm in High School) is working today and for some fine Italian dining, and then to the Rec to climb. Or maybe I'll go after I go to the Rec.  Better idea.

      Two major things happened today. It looks like I'll be taking Monday off to go to Austin - my grandfather had a stroke which paralyzed his left side.  And it looks like the block on my transcripts from A&amp;M is about to be lifted which will finally let me do something about my degree!    But I had a great night out last night.  Met a lot of random people which was a lot of fun.  Finished off that pack of Red Kamel's that I bought for the most dubious of reasons.  I woke up this morning with a moderate hangover, and was like "huh? work?" Hehehe.

      Sometimes you can say things on blogs which elicit one hell of a reaction. I mean, I'm sure that if I were to totally burn some bridges, then I could say whatever I bloody well want to say on my own damn blog. However, if I only burn some bridges, but not others, then the unburnt bridges might  urlLink spontaneously combust . Which sucks, because I like one bridge in particular a lot, but since that bridge has its own problems and God only knows if bridge repair technicians (medic!) are on their way, then I'm pretty much forced into keeping my mouth shut.    But I still think someone needs a good amount of verbal abuse hurled their way.    And that's pretty much all I'm allowed to say about that.

      I've finally got enough things on my mind to mitigate the impact of any one thing on my poor psyche.  Yay!  Hopefully, that'll last for a little while.

      I love these little mini-vacations.  A two-day getaway to the apartment of your choice.  Sprinkle random activities, season to taste.  Jenn and I attended A&M United Methodist this morning.  It was pleasant, but, she talks a lot! During the service even!  She even whooped!!  Needless to say, I was caught off guard. Hahaha.  I took Communion, but I only mention it because I have a proclivity to visit new churches on the day when they have Communion. I've got to sort of speed-observe whether or not the particular church conforms more or less to what I know is in the Bible while simultaneously evaluating my past couple days to make sure that I'm spiritually in a place where I can participate.  So that's kind of stressful.  I'm so used to going out to eat now, a habit I basically was required to pick up from Misty, then I went to Rudy's for some solo bbq after the service.  It kinda sucks eating in public alone, but then again, I was hungry and there was naught but 'tatoes in the fridge.  And I got a new toy. Yay!   Update: Check out the content-sensitive Google banner ad up top.  A couple days ago, it was all about trance and climbing.  Now it's got love poetry and the ten commandments. Bwahahahaha.  Google's always good for a laugh.

      Ok, I had a pretty sweet Saturday. I had a little mid-morning workout, a four hour you're-so-rusty-but-damn-that-felt-good climbing bonanza, I got the sandwich that Coffee Station owed me, I learned Jennie's name from Rebecca and Rebecca's name from Jennie in a smooth not-mad-at-for-forgetting sort of way (they're twins, they work at different places, connect the dots), and then I went and saw Will Farrel's Anchorman.  The movie was funny, I'll give it that.  But I could have done without the George W. Bush cheapshot at the end.  What is this crap? Is July the month of Bush Administration black-eyes-on-the-big-screen?  I almost afraid of watching "I, Robot" for fear of YABB (yet another Bush bashing).  And I wasn't alone, I heard half a dozen people grumbling about it as the credits rolled.  I even had one girl whining at me about it!  Hollywood, fuck off.

      After last night, I figured I'd take a short nap after work yesterday before heading out to Northgate.  Yeah, that plan didn't work. Hahahaha, I woke up at 8am this morning full of energy which was awesome, so I went and worked out.  Time to coax those climbing muscles back into shape!  Ah this feels good, my forearms are still twitching as I write this which is mildly annoying, but ah well.  The only downside here is that I still need a climbing partner, maybe I can find someone on texasclimbers.com .  Really though, I need to move to a city with a rock gym, and not stick around college station anymore.  But I need a new job to do that.  Anyone need a crack .NET programmer?  Hehehehehe.  I've got the whole day, it's only 10:30 am, what am I gonna do?  I think I'm gonna shell out the $15 to go boulder at the A&M rock wall...

I've been on like one crazy week long party, getting home after work and going out every night, but last night some old friends and I went up to Chicken, shot pool, drank, and met some cool people.  One of the guys with us works there, so we got to play pool for free all night - an awesome perk.  After they kicked us all out at 2am, we grabbed our trunks and jumped in the hot tub over at Sterling apartments.  That was a blast, we were diving off the sides and just monkeying around in the pool.  One of the girls turned out to be a raver kid, so of course, we hit it right off. And, as it always seems to, everyone's favorite subject of body piercings came up, um, yeah she and I are tied on that one. Oh, and then we had waffles. Mmmmm, good.  So basically, I rolled in around 5:30, got a quick shower to wash off the funk, rolled into bed about 6, rolled out of bed around 7, took another shower, and rolled into work around 8.    I'm so excited to see Jenn on Sunday, that'll be a blast.  Church then bar hopping? lol, you gotta love that girl.  Yeah, Dave's had a fun week...  but, honestly, it would've been better if a certain person was still around...

      I've realized the most wonderous thing. Consider,  How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! (1 Jn 3:1) and also, Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.  This is the first and greatest commandment.  And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'" I had read verses like these since before I can remember, "God loves you," was always heard around my house and my church.  I was taught the whole "love is a verb" and not "an overheated passion" thing, but I guess I never really understood honestly what that was all about - I mean, I suppose that I accepted that God loved me like the way I accepted that McDonald's has billions and billions sold (and no, I never went and saw Mel's The Passion of the Christ, but yes, I know Jesus died on a cross for me).  So, I guess I missed the Sunday School lesson where they taught what love actually is (aside from "you'll just know when you're in love" which is honestly no help at all), so I decided that if I thought I loved her, then I'd better bloody well know what I was getting into before I told her.  Lo and behold, I found this: Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.  Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. (1 Co 13:4-7) How awesome is that?! As surely as I breath, I would want to love and be loved like that.  I now know what God is acting like when He says He loves me.  I now know how I am supposed to love Him, and love others, including her.  So, while I'm still struggling with my own failures, and the consequences of those failures on those I care about, at least I understand what my goals are - what it takes to fulfill the first and second greatest commandments.  I am learning, I am growing, and it is wonderful, I will not be the same person in 5 years as I am today.  And praise God for that, eh?

      I went to Coffee Station this evening, after playing basketball with some guys from work - this has nothing to do with the post, but crikey, how did I run around a full court for an hour during high school?  My muscles don't remember how to play  at all .  I left the court dripping with sweat, and I could feel each individual muscle fiber twitching.  So anyway, I went to Coffee Station, conviently located a short walk away from my apartment complex, and got a lime/passion fruit Italian soda.  Bar none, the best Italian soda flavor combination you can get, in case you wanted to know.  &lt;interlude&gt; I just got a surpise phone call from a girl whom I spent a summer - there was a little troupe of us; those were good people.  Looks like she's still in College Station, and presumably we're going to go to her church on Sunday and then go bar hopping - hey, I'm just passing along what she said. &lt;/interlude&gt;  Ok, I'm sitting outside and looking at the stars.  I started thinking about how photons are ejected from these massive fusion reactions thousands of light years away.  These photons travel across the vast gulf of space and terminate on the back of my retina.  And then I think, surely this is profound, but it's not.  Profound is the hard work a certain person is putting into a certain relationship.  Stars have nothing on her.

      A couple months back I bought a few books on climbing.  One of the books is nothing but knots.  There are like 200 different knots in this book, knots for climbing, fishing, restraint, hauling, etc.  In the past week or so, I've spent a fair amount of time studying these knots, and now I can tie about 20 or so from memory.  I have to admit that it's as much fun tying these knots as it is to consider the practical applications of them.  If you're interested, you can read another review  urlLink here .

       I drew near, she drew away. A lusting heart. Tormented, the day became night.  I drew near, she drew away. A loving heart. Uplifted, the night became day.  Redemption. At last. Redemption.  My Father has given me such a rich life; He has watered my heart, and shown me how to change and grow.  You, O Lord, keep my lamp burning; my God turns my darkness into light (Ps 18:28). I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation. I will sing to the Lord, for he has been good to me (Ps 13:5-6).

      In China, the government runs most (by 'most' I mean 'all') of the major newspapers.  Sure, they have freedom of the press, the press is free to run what the government approves of.  Therefore, things like the 200,000-person protest in Hong Kong last week turned into 'a troublesome traffic jam' or 'a few people getting together to celebrate the anniversary of reunification with China' in Beijing.  Consequently, analysts have to read everything coming out of the country with a grain of salt.  What's not written is as important as what is written, and it's their job to figure out what really happened from what was written.  Now, I only bring this up to contrast myself with these paragons of understanding of the written word, because I'm a complete boob at the fine art of reading between the lines.  So if anyone can point me to Sun Tzu's The Art of Not Getting Oneself Into Hot Water (Again), for the love, please tell.

      Wow, I feel better. I had a good talk with a neutral third party.  Now I've just got to figure out what I want to do this weekend, I may just go solo climbing - dangerous as that is.  Really, I don't care, but I want to do something, because staying at home is just sad.  Maybe I can get my brother to come down from Dallas... hmmm

      She said,   I think the low carb thing is stupid. People lose weight by not eating carbs, but then once they reach their goal weight they go off the diet and back to eating whatever they want, and then they gain all the weight back. Then they wonder what went wrong. DUH!! You starved yourself of essential things your body needs, then gave them all back at once.  Then he said,  Join me and together let's kill these Atkins people.   LMAO.

      I just was informed that I won't be going climbing this weekend.  A complete disappointment.  I really needed to get away; I need a vacation.

      I took out my tongue ring last night.  I'm sure the hole has healed by now, but not the hole in my heart (awww).  We had the good times, TR and me (and various others *cough*).  But we've grown distant in the past couple months, and Misty says she's half-n-half about it.. which I think means 'take it out' in girl-speak (but I'm not that good at girl-speak, translators are welcome).  It feels really wierd not having a couple balls in my mouth. Metal. ::pulls out a red card:: Mind, Gutter, break it up.  *sigh* just as well, I'll be able to lick ice cream without trenching it or worrying about chipping my teeth. ;)

      The weekend started off pretty poorly, but launched around 3pm Sunday afternoon.  I'm exhausted, so I'll write about it later.  ...  hours pass  ...  Ok, now I'm ready to write.  Let's touch on Saturday real quick. I was sad on Saturday, I did nothing productive, and I just slunked around the aptartment all day long. I knew what was wrong, but I didn't fix it. Instead, I just let it fester in my mind. Then I fucking  called her , and she didn't call me back. Boy, that was dumb. Just dumb, and I knew I shouldn't have done it, but I didn't want to get off my lazy ass and fix the sadness problem.  Ok, fast forward to Sunday. I skipped church, and slept in. I considered going to Peace, but that would've just looked bad. So whatever, I ran some errands instead. Then I got a couch! and a coffee table! Actually, that may have happened on Saturday, but getting new furniture was definitely a not a Saturday thing. Whatever, they look great, and really fill out my living room. Then I went climbing ... for 6 hours.  We played games! This one game, you picked a "goal" hold, climbed to it, then removed a hold of your choice. Obviously, the jugs go first, and it takes more and more technical moves to get to the goal. Then we played a round of Add-On, with 8 people. It was the largest game of add-on I've ever played. We had people adding on their move, jumping off, running to the start, getting back to their last move, and facing 7 new moves to do. Insanity. I got to top rope, lead, and check out all the cute girls with Eric the Homophobe from the comfort of their nice couch.  Afterwards, I went to F's, met the girl that I'd been talking to who works there, and got a date. Can you see how Sunday was the good day? I drove off thinking that if the night ended right then it'd be ok. It was not to end, however, I ended up getting a call from one of the rec staffers with an invite to watch Best of Will Farrell DVDs and drink cheap wine with a bunch of people up at his place. When the Jeopardy skit came on, I nearly suffocated I was laughing so hard. "Suck it Trebek". Classic.  I slept so well.  Ok that's the end of the wrapup, but it's time for another installment of Ctae's Introspection Corner.  Basically, for the past two weeks or so, I've been talking with this girl, let's call her, Rachel. Nothing kinky, just flirting, talk, and whatnot. No need to get into it. Well, tonight I told her that it wouldn't work out between us because we're different in a couple of ways that, frankly, I don't want to have to deal with. Why do I mention this? Because it's probably the first time I've rejected someone. What normally happens is that the girl does things I don't like or can't stand, but I stay with it thinking good times will come. Then I can forget about the bad times, and move on. That never happens, if it had, I'd probably be married. For instance, with Misty, honestly, we should've broken up back in March. She's a good girl, but she wasn't meeting  my needs .  I should've ended it.  Misty and I could've been good  friends , but we're definitely not cut out to be  partners , and I knew it back in March. I'm a dumbass, however, and didn't brake or end it, I escalated it because "maybe she wants more,  and then , it'll be good times," I told myself. Dumbass. I escalated that train right into a wall. I told myself that I loved her. I believed it.  I loved her, but it was all wrong.  I was pushing things I had no honest control over. The train wreck was inevitable, I knew it, and could only hope the end was further off.  I took Misty rock climbing once. She was safe, and I pushed her to climb higher, farther. She was tired and wanted down, but I was in control (of the rope). She'd come down when I'd allow her, at the time, I wanted her to work harder, climb higher. She did for a bit, but then got pissed, and I let her down. Later, I told her that I did it to see how much she could take before she broke, but we recognized that it was ok since I was in control, and everyone was safe.  Well, in our relationship, I wasn't in control. There was no rope. I couldn't lower her down because I didn't want to admit that it wasn't ever going to work out. So I pushed her on and on until she broke. When she finally broke, so did my heart.  I took control today. I let Rachel down in a kind way. I didn't accelerate when I saw the gap in the tracks ahead. I let it go, and I'm moving on. Maybe the thing with the Fazoli's girl will work out, maybe it won't. I guess we'll see. I know exactly what I want, and, frankly, I'm not going to settle for less.

      I woke up this morning missing her.  That's a pretty hard way to start the day.  Oooh .... what a wierd feeling - I just had some sort of crazy ... ooh ... buzz. I know, it's probably those pills I took for joint pain last night.  Lately when I've been climbing, my shoulders will hurt when I'm locked off on a hold, but then release. So anyway, I went to Smoothie King last night, and picked up a bottle marked 3-in-1 Joint Health. "These statements are not evaluated by the FDA," so who knows what sort of crazy reaction is going on in my brain. I just hope the pills help the stiffness in my joints.  Ok, that solves that,  now to take a hot shower, workout, and go rollerblade around Research Park if it stays cool outside.

      You would be too if your belay partner wasn't paying attention and let you  hit the deck from 20'  up the wall. Thankfully, I didn't break or sprain anything. Aaron, the guy I climb with, got a suitable tongue lashing from the staff, and made damn sure that I had no slack in the rope for the rest of the workout. Hahaha, he was pretty stressed about it, but I can understand that, I mean, your negligence almost seriously injured someone. You can tell I'm not too mad about it, I just never get that angry about anything really. It's not worth it. Like I said, I let it go, and we kept climbing.  I am so excited to go climbing for 3 days at E-rock the weekend after next. I found out that we'll be renting a hotel room instead of camping out. Which is good, because it's way too hot outside for camping right now.  I've got a birthday coming up on the first of September. Just thought you might be interested in knowing. Hopefully, I'll live to see it.  I'm getting kind of sick of Modest Mouse now that I've listened to tracks #3, 4, 13 over and over and over. I even heard #3 played as bumper music on a talk radio show.   After all they shared could he simply say, "no". After all they shared he turned away from her to go. She said she wouldn't cry. That was really just a lie.   That was just the vocals playing right now on the stream I'm listening to. Now you can listen along too! Damn, aren't you enjoying my stream of conciousness writing this morning?  Let's see, anything else? Oh, I'm getting a love seat, a coffee table, and a kitchen table without chairs tonight from a girl I climb with. The couch is really comfortable, but the upholstery is pretty fugly. I'll be going to WAL*MART for a couch cover for sure.  I was at Coffee Station the other night, and there was this fairly attractive girl strandling the trunk by the stairs. Let's just say that I wouldn't have minded being the trunk, ok? So, I walked over and started talking to her. Then she smiled at me, oops, braces. What is it with me, and picking out the young? Anyway, I finished the conversation up, and walked away. I just needed to confess that, and lacking my best friend, this deserted street corner will have to do. Thanks.    Oh, I just added a link to an Atom feed on the sidebar to your right.

      My secret to happiness? A little trick I'm not going to reveal, but I'm feeling pretty damn awesome today. I had an awesome weekend; I already blogged about Friday, so I'll just cover Saturday and Sunday before going back to work.  After I recovered from the hangover, I went out and picked up the Modest Mouse's  Good News for People Who Like Bad News . I figured you'd be able to guess from that last post of mine.  I've just been looping  Float On  and  Ocean Breathes Salty  pretty much all weekend. Having nothing planned for Saturday, I picked up Max Payne 2 from the bargain bin, and played it through. Pretty fun game, great graphics, fun plot, but shorter than the original.  I wasn't too keen about spending all afternoon inside playing computer games, but I wanted to rest my shoulder for Sunday's climbing at the Rec.  Resting my shoulder turned out to be the best thing I could have done given the insane workout I did on Sunday.  I showed up around 4pm, met a guy without a partner who wanted to lead climb.  Let's get this straight, I haven't seriously climbed lead since the night last fall when Misty came up to watch me.  Somehow, I managed to glide through the skills test and get my pass - and I didn't even have to pay for it!.  Then I climbed lead on a number of more difficult routes than I'd been top-roping in the past few weeks.   It was really awesome, but the guy had to leave, so I jumped in with a group of girls who really pushed me to climb hard.  I actually did pretty well, and my shoulder isn't hurting so much.  I'm going to really turn up the heat on Wednesday and see what I'm capable of.  The only disappointment was not being able to jump into the lap pool before it closed, oh, and not getting to the Brethern church in the morning.  Yeah, that happens when you play games till 2am.  I could have made it to Peace on time, but I didn't want to incite a riot by my mere presence, so I did laundry instead.  I finished off the weekend with a cold shower, Fazoli's, and Coffee Station.  Am I getting predictable yet? I loving having an active routine with minimal idle time, oh, and making sure my brain is awash in happy-inducing neurotransmitters helps too.  A girl at work went to Maggie Moo's for ice cream this weekend, and recommended it highly.  I think I'll check it out tonight around 7:30.  It's in the Rock Prairie / 6 shopping center if you read this in time and care to join me. Hahaha, ya ya ya, I know, no one reads this blog.
