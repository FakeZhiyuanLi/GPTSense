       hav we come to a point where romance means nothing and just sayin 'i love you' is enuff to hold together a relationship? what is actually more important in a relationship and is a passionless relationship actually a proper relationship?!   yes its old fashioned, but wot did happen to gd old cheesy romance?!  is it somewhere out there or ihav i just not found it yet! i no its dumb, but i was brought up on disney films- filled romance n happy endings! mayb im mad 2 want it but thats just how i feel! mayb it comes naturally to some ppl n not to others, or mayb it only comes naturally for u wen its with the right person for u! i  think a relationship minus the passion and romance leave companionship - which yes thats a good thing but is it actually a happy companionship?!     "companionship: relationship of friends: the company of friends and the relationship that exists between them,a person you spend a lot of time with."   "OLD USE in the past, a young woman who was paid to care for and provide friendship for an old or ill woman, especially while she was travelling" is it wrong that i want more than that?!     now that woman have 'equal rights' it seems they r the ones wearin the trousers alot more than the men- in some cases even when thay dont piticually want toI it seems guys want us to make all the desisions and all the moves- plz correct me if this is just me n my relationships but i think it sucks! it just shouldnt b so much like this!  grrrrrrrrrr!  its soo frustrating! im not sayin i want flowers and posh presants, im sayin i want 2 b made 2 feel special! if we are more than just friend then there needs 2 b a distinction btween being together and being just friends! if that doesnt make sence wel.....i dunno it makes sence 2 me n i dont care how silly it sounds! :P

(the coolness!:S)  today i hav to admit i hav been kinda.....how to put it nicely......moody! i hav rather alot on my mind to say the least! i dont think i can quite go in to most of it atm coz im still kinda hurtin...alot- briefly, i like sum1 alot- mi x , and now one of my close mates has started likin him, really really likin him alot n i think he likes her just as much. i no it doesnt sound much-  teenage girly problem ! but it really hurts,... really really hurts!  im kinda surprised im not used to it by now, coz wen i first started goin out with him a gd, almost best mate of mine tryed to break us up coz she liked him, later on in the ' relationship ' he tells me he really likes one of my other closest freinds! grrrr! but yet i still like him?! madness! i dont no wot it is about him,everyone likes him....he just makes you feel so special and wanted, just by tlkin to you! but is he the one for me?! lol we so should go on like  ricky lake  or sumit ' go ricky, go ricky! '....or not!  part of me's sayin  'he'll b better off with her, she's great'  and  'leave them to b happy together' ,  but then another part is sayin  'fight for him'  and  'dont just give up' , but i dunno, im confussed! well, im always confused but not im just completly cafuzzled! :S:S:S:S and on top of that i get my  gcse  results  2moz!  5yrs of school workin up to these n ill find it out soo soon!  but my other problems r bigger! i could go down the beach 2dy but they'll both b there n i really really dont wanna c anyone, i just dont feel like i can face seeing ppl! i just wouldnt no wot 2 say to anyone bout anythin-especially to her! last night, online she was turned 2 me and asked how i'd feel n wot id do if they got 2gether! my god! she new/no's how i feel about him, but as long as everyone else is happy! the sad thing is that was actually my outlook on things,  'if it'll make sum1 else happy! ' but y should i? nobody else does! i dunno wot 2 do or wot 2 say....grrrrrr! xxx

      if only people believed and went along with this my life for one, would b a hell of a lot happier, i no that! i think its a very valid point! y is it wen ppl hav something, they always at some point want something else, and can neva just settle for what theyve got! again, plz correct me if im wrong but from my experience so far this is frightenly true! altho sometimes it is little but important things, others are just selfish self-satisfying things! i mean, if wot uve got is good and the kinda thing u want, y look sumwhere else for another of what uve already got?! but if its smaller things to evolve wot uve already got then y not. is it because ppl get bored of what theyve got, see a chance for sumthing differerent n seise it, thinkin of thereown well being and happiness? i dunno! yas im complicating matters buT:"Woman are meant to be loved, not to be understood" altho i soo make sence:S:S:S i went 2 sams this evening, it was gd, :) gd 2 c him again since...yeah!! felt a tad wierd at times- for example he got abit wierd about  nath coz we were txtin eachother, n  one minute i look up n he's like staring at me and its like 'ahh this is how it used 2 b!*sigh*,  but then i look right next to him n see a very nice present from another close friend of his. petty...yes,but understandable also yes and im my face! again with 'the door thing' (hehehe!) if i was 2 open the half open door again, the past is always gonna b there one form or another.  is it possible to move forwards with the past constantly in ure face?!  when uve been let down, and had a lot of doubts about someone, or just in general, how easy is it 2 just move on merrily, altho knowing in the bac of ure mind that u hav 2 b  prepaired for  'yet another'  war against another lovestruck female...to what extent is it worth it?  especially when u care for your enemy almost as much as you do for your prize!  if love causes hatred and the loss of close friends, is it actually worth it! hmmm.......heavy!  change........wot is change?! i just dont get it! people say...ill change! but do they....do they really really change?! i mean, not all change is good, sum ppl r fine how they r, but if ure gonna say that ure gonna change....shouldnt it show it the slightest?! but u can always just loose interest and completly give up wen ure the one who has to do the chassin 4 once! thats always an option!  'im gonna change the way i act! i promise......well im gonna show you how i feel for you, now, fully, and all the time'  sayin this is great, im not askin ppl 2 change- they can b who they wanna b, but this is showing passion, and emotional feelings but sum ppl just turn out to be all words! can i ask, when does 'all the time start'?!  o well here 2 hopin!  i have no willpower! ive given up already! if sum1 is interested in me, its up2 them im done chasing round in circles! im weak! im afraid i dont make moves- unless i happen 2 b in an exceedinly horney mood! likely?! hmmm sorry u prob didnt wanna no that much! :S but thats just me! like it or....give up!i no this all seems quite harsh, n im sorry if it does but if p[pl really wanna no how i feel- this isnt believe it or not nessisarially ablout certain ppl, bits r then most r just bits of feelings ive got inside which juist kinda flow out!:S i think i might actually hav the most fked up n anoyin tummy probs n stuff  eva!  my god! i thought sam was frustrating:P:P nothing just seems to b right with me! im gonna hav 2 go c the doctor again coz its just......wrong?! soz once again an 'overshare!' but a very painfull overshare!:S    BEJEESUS!  hehehe! how funky is that word! go sam s! its his word but it is pretty good! u hav 2 respect it! hehehe! i cant actually fisically   hehehe!  bless! nath got bac from camp, n told me about one of the things they did 2 him.....heheh! i would share buit he will kill me! but dam it i missed the show! hehehe! but theres always next time! whahaha (cackle) hehe! lol im 2 hyper! *deep breath n calm down* hehe! stop tlkin! help! hmmm if i tlk ne more ill prob  upset sum1 or sumit! so night night!  huge hugz! hehehe! luv ya! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

(and bitin n anoyin sam s of course!) i dunno y i felt like this- i would hav thought i would love to b really interactive coz ive been workin so mch but i just felt rather...plz dont notice me...im not here! it might've been the constant sugar rush?! i had a craving! n the only thing accessable to fulfil it was sweets! so we walked 2 the shop n brought loadsa lovely fruityness! hehe! the pbag seemed 2 b endless! ppl kept eatin buit it neva went down! i was the  'never endin sweet supply'?!  ahhh the goodness! hehe!its so strange! ive mainly been seein sam latly- therefore should b enjoyin other ppl, but i couldnt help missin him- u c a couple n think...i want that! n then u think wait ive got that! but he's not here!  *tear!*  :'( lol the soppyness! hehe! hmmm it was gd tlkin 2 emz n gemz tho! n i cleared a few things up in my head! which is always a success coz its so eeeerrrrrrggggg!

      hi...hmmmm! yea i havnt posted recently- coz i normally post wen im happyish...n im just not to be honest!  yes it was xmas again....o the fun! yet again it was the same as normal, but this time i didnt hav a huge fight with dad! (only a slight lil one!) it was the usual...wake up, open pressants, (which is always gd- soo easy 2 tell if ppl really like your gifts or not!) then its dun.....we all do our own seperate thing. it was gd! just...lacking in magic n me lacking in......happyness!  i was right about my free txts! :$  they all kinda went 2 days ago! so like 300 txts in like a week! *eak* how am i gonna cope till we go bac 2 college?! im actually lookin 4ward 2 goin bac! *shock!* i think this is the 1st time eva! but its gd there! not really the lessons, but my frees!:S i get 2 sit around with people i really like n chat, n play games etc! im missin kelly! i need girly chats! n then theres playin shithead with pete! ive actually got 2 the point that i wanna go 2 college- even 4 the lessons, coz then it'll take my mind off other things which being at home im constantly thinking of!  i really dont no how 2 see it atm....coz guys keep tellin me their opinions -from a 'guys perspective' n its just like...'WOT!' hmmm! i soo hope guys are all very different! :S  its new years eve 2moz, n i can actually say im lookin forwad 2 the new year! so far, hopefully and inbetween all my exams:S theres barcelona with photography (yay!) n  mum n dad hav just told me they wanna go 2 CUBA! like all enclusive! how amazin is that...yay! :D  so mayb the new year can be the door to a whole fresh start, and a year of happyness?! it would do me good! forget the past n focus on the future....or thats what ppl keep telling me....but i think im very nieve....i just cant physically listen 2 them! thats pretty mch the highlight of my life atm n thats like quite vague coz who knows how long ne of us have left.....we could die at any moment! but...hmmmm...! ok random flow of thought! :S  say i died like 2moz, who would actually notice?! coz ....i dunno...it seems that the important ppl 2 me tlk 2 me n all, but wen i contact them..or wen its convienient 4 them! like if im online it easy...if im not n i havnt txt em....2 much hassel! so, as mch as ppl say they'd care...how would they no?! i could b dead now n no one would no!  im thinking about death way, ways 2 much! it disturbing! n morbid...but yet i dont find it scarey or slightly spine-tingeling thinking about me dying and it being the end of everything 4 me! if it happens it happens...but what if......and truely...if only!.....

      its true, its a normality for people to live with! there're ppl everywhere hurting, physicallyand mentally! expecially emotionally! do guys actualy get as emotionally attached as girls do?! or is it just certain weaklings that get attached..what eva sex?! (random trail of thought:S)  hmmm...i feel so :S its so easy to take for granted what u hav, not even taking into account that the thing u complain about is what others have always wanted! each day we take our things for granted n dont even think what it'd b like to not have it! like it only takes a second to loose someone close, to loose them forever- maybe with them not knowing the truth, or not feeling special and loved by you, yet it only takes a moment to make that tiny bit of effort to make them feel like totally priceless! coz if you miss that moment, you could loose it and everything forever....  the thing that really gets me is the thought of not being able to say goodbye...like either if i was to die, or one of my friends....to leave everything unsaid, ...... to leave feelings unknown, ..... to miss the chance to express how mch they care for me.... ppl say its never to late...but how is it not?! the longer you wait, the harder it is and the lower ure chances get! whilst your sitting happily at your computer, a person you love could've died.....

      im doin well do far! im 40%gay! woohoo! 76%compatable n marriable?! eak!hehe!  hehe n im 63% loveable : Is it a bird? A plane? Is it a boy? A girl? Is it love, or is it lust? Ah, you. You are that rare mix of sensitive and sensual, romantic and randy, pride and prejudice, etc. When you see your crush, you waffle like a Belgian, unsure of whether you'd rather paint their toes or suck on their toes. Poets have long been puzzled by your kind. You'll never fall for robots or nymphos, but you will suffer longs bouts of marriage.     urlLink        Your Passion is Purple!  You're passionate - but more people view you as funky.  You're more about sampling the different flavors of passion...  Not that you don't mind getting swept off your feet.  It's just you need a little someone new every once and a while.      and.....  You are a Romantic Realist  Okay, so you fall in the middle.  You know that love isn't like a greeting card…  Yet you can always find a greeting card to describe your feelings.    You are the best of both worlds  Girly yet independent, dreamy yet serious.  Almost any guy can find balance with you.      urlLink        You Are a Sensual Kiss!  Wet, soft, sweet, rough…   For you, kissing is all about how it feels  Whether you're kissing a longtime sweetie or a stranger  It's all about the sensual experience, nothing else!      urlLink        You Are Dreamy Sexy!  Your sex appeal stems from your constant dreamlike state.  Not only do you think about fairy tales, you have the ways of a fairy princess.  You're sweet, soft manner attracts similarly dreamy guys  And your natural girly beauty lures all men in, so be discriminating!    Vx

      hey. hmmm! not so bad as yesterday! today was fun! had a free 2nd, so i'd planned 2 do loadsa business revision - brought in my folder n everything! but there were exams everywhere, so we had like no1 2 go! our sports cafe was close! *tear* so instead we went on an  'expadition!'  me, maisie, carrie n kelly and floyed all had frees, n then kim didnt bother goin 2 her lesson n pete decided 2 cum 2 coz he didnt wanna go 2 law! ( which is fair enough!  ) so we aimed for forfars just gonna get food,  but then we decided 2 try 2 get lost?!?!  i cant actually remember who decided this, or why we'd want to...but it seemed like a gd idea!   so we wondered down sum random roads and found this random park with like a huge kiddys adventure play area! genious!  at this point we were rather hi on sugar ( as usual  :S) n ended up doin the monkies walk in a linked line down the middle of a road!  we like soo had the rhythem! :)  great fun! n ppl who saw us seemed 2 b amused! hehe! we then spotted the sea, looking extreemly big n funky, so we aimed townrds it..it was like soo in tidy thing! like just about hitting the wall! im all  'yay'  coz pete had his lil digi cam with him, so we took some funky beach photos and wave photos that i can use in my work, n we had a group photo...to  'chereish the memory'  as kimothy said! hehe!  n i kinda still hav petes hat which i nicked off him the other day...well i didnt actually nick it, he said i could keep wearing it after i borrowed it...c im not evil! n he just kinda forgot it after we went 2 the beach..hehe! its wierd! ive like neva dun hats b4! but its really funky n it keeps ure ears warm!  genious!   so for once, by the time i got to band i was like really happy n jolly- people were shocked coz  i was actually smiling!  ( they've kinda got it in their minds that im goin through some kind of teenage rebellion lookin unhappy stage...but hello mayb i just hav issues!   eargh! ) but i was happy! n wen im happy- nicks happy n deans happy! so we were a happy percussion section! n i wasnt as shy wen playin kit n stuff! ( in my funnky petey hat! )!  *go me!*  hehe!  then i got home......hmm!  its completly crappy ! dad got in a mood with me...and i didnt even say anything 2 him! so he stormed up to bed n then if id gone up 2 c him he would've shouted at me 2 leave him alone, so having lots of practice with this, ( and still being in a very fragile! ) i didnt go upn i left him alone!  (makes sence ya?!)  so wen i eventually went up 2 say goodnight he randomly starts havin a go at me how im a bad daughter n i dont bother coming up 2 tlk 2 him n make convo?!?!?! do u get this?! coz i dont! wot am i 2 do?!  i soo dont need this!  so then he upset me more! n im now in one of those really, really fragile moods! so like u say sumit in a slightly mean way n  *poww*  my eyes start leakin!  i think i need 2 see sam. i havnt seen him in like ages....n it might make things a lil easyer...but then it could (n i think  it soo will ) make things 100 times harder! but then if i dont im still stuck in my dilema, which doesnt seem to be going ne where! hmm i dunno! yeah  i need 2  c him! i  want 2  c him! i  miss him ! but then thats like 2wice we havnt worked.....i mean its not like we're spoke bout gettin bac or owt...havnt really spoken that mch, but eargh! i hav a completly split made-decision! ( therefor no made decision!)  i hav my friends who r tryin 2 help, if they dont no sam,they're just like thinkin of it from my side....do i wanna get hurt again?! coz they dont no him so they are more set on the wot i want n how i feel! ( which still doesnt help wen even i dont no !) its good 2 no their opinions tho n like hear their stories n experiences n situations!  n then ppl hu no him r like yeah but he's.....n u2..... n stuff! but theres so many  buts ! everything is like  but then if......what if?!?!    *eak!*   Vx

      ok...not good! im in a really spiritually out of body mood! again! i really wanna vanish! like die! n c who cares n how they care! coz im gettin such mixed signals from some ppl i just dont no anymore! i think its coz im off college, trapped in a more unsocial outerworld of my house doin work, not able 2 c the ppl who care for me enough to make me feel loved!   When you walk through a storm Keep your chin up high And don't be afraid of the dark. At he end of the storm Is a golden sky And the sweet silver song of a lark.  Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain, Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown.Walk on, walk on With hope in your heart And you'll never walk alone, You'll never walk alone  you'll never walk alone from carousel, martin jsut randomly sent it 2 me..mayb coz my name shows some of my dispair n giving-upness...   but sometimes being alone with my heart i feel even more alone than i should! not from lack of people loving me i dont think, but i think from lack of direction! i mean i dont know where im goin with my life or what i want! i mean i hav many amazinly great people i can b with that i lv, but yet i cant help but feel emptly! like a part of me's missin! itmight just b coz im missin ppl! i mean simon n pete r on holiday, sam's like dissownin himself from me n pushin himself further away which i supose its gd if im gonna get with simon n move on...but im still lackin in something! n i really really need a tim hug! i think i m missin him altho ive neva met him! n i need lotsa hugs! n no ones here 2 hug me! mayb thats y im down coz i feel alone.....n i cant 'walk on' n open my heart coz if i open my heart it will just get hurt again! n now im not making any sence and im gettin way way 2 emotional! *drys eyes!* when in doubt blame hormones! :| *blushes!* i think im gonna go snuggle up with my snowey n mayb watch sum ally mcbeal! *comfortyness!*  Vx

      :S hmmm morbidity! but o well!  ooooo! guess who i was talking too...well 'chatting' too- as in friendlyness.....sean! :|:|:|:|:| yes im as shocked as everyone, but whats more shocking is the fact that all the time i was talking too him i didnt hate him,want him to die, hurt him and i wasnt even angry with him! it was...strange! the first time in like....3 years?!?! he's back home from the army for two weeks. and we were just chatting..he even brought up the whole him breaking my heart thing...hmmm the first time he was actually willing to talk about it and tell me why what happened happened....it takes a while to get my head round as he's always refused to talk about it, and would just get nasty,.....when i could be bothered to try! he still remembers how it was...which is strange cause i never thought he really noticed...he said he really missed my texts and our calls (coz we spent hrs on the phone) and stuff like that....   quite hard to deal with...not that i like him/love him anymore, but because i wanted to hear him say this stuff soo much years ago, but i gave up and tryed to put it behind me....and now he's said it! its like....i dunno...sureal..and very satisfyin in a way to finally have things explained to me!   i always thought it was spite that caused him to do it..because he never gave me an explenation...but it as wierd...it was like a random outburst- as though he had to tell me because it was slowly eating away at his soul! wel maybe...he said he started to care for me more than emma *bitch of a gf who he was with for like ages* and it broke them up n he couldnt deal n stuff...i mean that is prob jusy an excuse....btu the fact he made the effort to tell me, because he wanted me to know ment alot! *simple things* i think he might have actually changed...*shock!* it only took the army to do it! :S  we might even meet up next week.... :| how wierd would that be?!?! last time we went rollerblading! :| im not too good at it...but ment i had to hold on to him alot!...hehe subtle ways to get closer to him! my word that was sooo long ago!   eak! im like totally in my own world, reminising in the past....hmmm!

      well hello there! well im back at college now! *horrey!!* yes that was a horrey! sad...yes, boffiny...hell no! i just missed my girlies! it was very strange to start with!(the whole me n pete in public finally goin out thing!) but its gettin easyer! its bad enough i feel :| from insecurities..but stairing ppl?!?! ive been feeling quite :S tho, altho its great with pete, so i should be extreemly happy inside and out, but i think im just hiding my inner feelings....   i havnt really spoken to simon, spoke to him online and he said he  'doesnt think we'll be able to be friends!'  and that he thinks  'it was a bad idea we went out because its wierd now! ' that hurt...that really hurt! cause how did we know how it was going to turn out! it could've gone either way! then he was like  'yea but ou never gave it a chance'   yep, just give the knife a twist! its not like i wanted it to end like it did! o and i anoy him! hmmm go me! i think im jus tfeeling like i used to feel, like im not being accepted for me being me, im just annoyin people... its just little things that make me feel like this:S   i think the thing that started it off was floyd. he was talking to kim and maisie about kim and steve and stuff like that, and he turned to her and said how she's not good enough for steve and he doesnt like her as much because she's getting too much like me!.... a simple comment..that leaves a painfull scar....  i mean i know im not going to get on with everyone....but i just cant help thinking why?! whats so bad with me?! what is it about me that annoys people and makes me not fit in?! ive tryed not to be so me-like...but is an endless stream of unhappyness worth pleasing a few people?! i want to just be accepted! fair enough if people dont like me...but is there any need to make spitefully comments?!  its not that im depressed, cause im happy, but i keep having patches of possibe depression and morbid moments, facinated by the shiney-pointedness of sharp objects...almost pathetic, but uncontrollable earges....  Too Afraid  You lock yourself away In hibernation mode When night turns into day You stay in your abode  Still running from your pain Turn to an only friend It opens up your vein You're wishing for an end  You watch blood trickle down A warm flow to the floor You notice it and frown You'll need to do some more  You're cutting yet more deep That one will really scar "Forever let me sleep" You wish upon a star  But you don't have the guts And so cheat death once more "I couldn't go past cuts" You think and hit the door  You wander off to bed Bleeding on the sheet The wish that you were dead A thought you will repeat    drastic..but utterly amazin! and no i didnt write it *unfortunatly* its.....incredible! she's amazin! a genious! i dont know how but her poems mean so much tome...they've really touched me.....

      well today started off well, work up to find texts from sam....   "lettin u know i passed out, now i remember a lot more. like why we finished. i know you thought it was2do with u, it was that i was fallin in love with some1 else"   i mean hello! thats o so nice of him to tell me as we broke up in.....DECEMBER! and yet after a few weeks of not being together he wanted us to 'see eachother' and get close?! and of course he thought he'd tell me this just after me gettin with pete....he just happened to remember?!?! convienient?! and he was like...my god i passed on other girls for u...hello i didnt for him! he hurt me soo soo fkin badly! but o yea he loves me so much coz im his world! i think he's serioulsly fked up in the head! and he wouldnt tell it was emilia that he was falin in love with bcoz he didnt wanna hurt her! ahhh bless he's such a caring darling! he's sick and cruel!   i have actually had a really good day! i worked, and i was all hyper coz after work at 3 i was goin to petes! i was kinda *eak* about the whole train thing, so he came to meet me after work!! hehe! bless him!  it was really gd at his! *sigh* we watched the lion king! soo gd! and it was all lovely! hehe!  so i got home all happy, to tlk to sam and get depressed about that- brought up bad memories of when we broke up, and then to read katies blog- im famous! i got a whole section dedicated to what a bad friend i am coz i neva tlk to her coz i didnt tell her in detail about me and pete! its not that i didnt wanna tell her, but i didnt hav a chance! when i was tlkin to her online, i had pete on the phone and was tlkin to like simon n sam online (the x's!) mainly sam was :S coz it was all :S n i was all upset, and me n pete were only jus ttlkin about it! so i didnt hav a chance to go into detail!  so she thinks im jus tbeing distant and says what a bad friend i am coz i treat them like crap! HELLO! when has she eva rung me?! or txt me tryin to sort this out?!?! she says how i havnt tryed, but why do i always hav to be the one who makes all the effort?! when i left blatch i thought id left behind me all the one-way relationships! i cant deal with this! esp with al this fkin sam crap!  after i read it i txt her sayin..... "look katie, i love u to bits, but u go on about what a bad friend i am, but at what point did u pick up the phone to ring me, or text me to see how i was or to sort thigs out with me?! u expect me to do all the chasin but u neva seem to care! u say i dont tlk to u, but when do u eva ask? ure aleays caught up in ue own problems to remotly notice anyone elses! i sont meanit in a mean way coz i lv u, but think about it"    yes its abit harsh, but its totally tru! i dont wanna upset her, but when someones anoyed with me for not makin an effort with them and they hardly ever put in the effort with me then what>!?! she cant jus tsay stuff like that! unless she's purposly tryin to upset me and hurt me?! i no we've got distant, but she needs to tlk to me about it and bother with it insteed of givin up!   i really cant deal with this!!

      i feel really down. ive been talking to sam. it hurts. just the way he talk. then i clicked on an old blog of mine and if was from when we were goin out....i just burst into tears! its not even that i want to be with him, i thought i did, but he's let me down so many times- and he didnt even say happy birthday to me on my bday!!! (not that i hold grudges!) he didnt put the effort in with me like he should've! like pete does! he actually makes me feel special! its just me and change...saying goodbye....althought we havnt been together for ages, its like we were kinda spirtitually together, so in a sence i was breaking up with him...so i jus tfind it hard to tlk to him now because i automatically think or the good times and not the bad times, and theres actually almost as many bad times as there are good! which is really really not what i need! so i need to just....get my head round him not being around, even as a friend...coz i no it's for the best!   *hides in the corner with chocolate in tears*  Vx

      Monday night... the disaster that was the easter party! i had my visions of the college party at the standard- ots of ppl - me, tim,kim,maisie,pete,andy and katie were all gonna cum bac 2 mine after to drink and stay over- it was gonna be great! i had a new outfit- lkil pink ruffly ra-ra skirt and a v.low backless lovely strappy haltery top!  it was all happy- sitting on the beach drinkin- pete sittin btween my legs- not in a pervy way! but coz he felt left out in a line, it was cole..and we're close! when we went to the club, firstly the bouncers took out almost full big bottle of vodka!! - very unammusin!  then we were all happy and chirpy...i turn around and theres pete sitting on the floor hitting his head against the wall like really really hard!!! of course i ran over and he just sat there..for lke ever! in silence...not saying or doin anything! as i was abit tipsey and it was really horrible (my best mate sitting there not reacting to me-we thought he wwas drugged) so i ran to the loo in tears. ages later, when id calmed down abit tim and andy had managed to pull him up and he was perched sumwhere else-still not reacting to us!  i then had kimmy run up to me to tell me how pete had been telling andy that he was like soo soo in love with me- more than Charmie! and thats y he was actin like that?!?!  then when i tryed to tlk to pete and try to get him to tlk to me, he would just say 'you know what i wanna say...i cant' i was jus tcompletly OMG!!   recently he's lkike lived here- mum and dad absolutly adore him! every oter sentence from them is...'go out with pete!' very irritating!  anyway! then he locked himself in the guys toilets- as if that would stop me! so i wasnt charging in and ended up climbing up on top of the toliet next to him- almost climbing over the top but completly stuck on the ceiling- in low cut top, mini skirt and stilletoes! *empressive ehh?!?!* in the end he came into the toilet i was stuck in and carried me down :$ we just sat their for ages hugging and crying. he wouldnt talk to me and i realy didnt know what to say! then the security guard came in and told me to get out- i dragged ete out with me!  we went outside *to the freezing cold* to get space. again there was alot of hugs and tears -we spoke abit but nor much. i managed to peteyfy him again - from sitting doin nothin to my petey.  in the meantime id completly left the others - i abandoned tim! :S opps! we got andy to ring his dad so him n pete could stay there- thought it was best that pete got some time away from me so he could really tink about what he wants- i told him i only think of him as a best mate.....  but now he's put doubt in my head! i cant get my head round it! coz i know sometimes when im with him i;m like OMW i so wanna be with him, and others im like hapy im not! i mean if he broke up with charmie and get with me, if we didnt work out he'd have lost both of u and i doubt we'd ever be that close again! i love our closeness! i do admit we're abnormally close,,,,so thats why i keep thinking maybe im jus tdenying it and i think we should be together!  i really dont know! tehres still sam! *sigh*  i really cant stop crying! seriously! the minute im alone i just explode- or if im huggin mum! its rediculous! but he looked so hurt - i know what its like to love someone and it not be returned! i feel like ive led him on so badly! and im crushing him! i really cant deal with this!  i really wanna just curl into a ball, sit in my room and cry for days! everyone says i look exhausted and tired- but im really just numb i dont know what i feel, i dont know what i think, i dont know what i want! im completly dead inside! and i cant stop crying! grrr!   in a way i dont think i want to be with him...but i cant not be with him! it doesnt make sence! i need him! he's always here for me..but then thats a friend thing!is he best jus tas a best friend?! i cant deal with this! i really cant! this is why im dead inside and why i now feel nothing coz im numb from all the confusion! i keep trying to find solutions frommy problems- then have to re-think them and think of some that dont include knives, pills or cars! its just if i died then everything would be better! pete would be with charmie and be happy- he wouldnt be trying to make himself unconsious on the wall or burn his arms! ad ui wouldnt be feeling like this! i dont want to cry so much! i care so much for him! its unbelievable! i love him to bits- but is it a friend thing?! i jus tdont know anymore! *eak* i wanna die so mch right now!

      ok now i feel really crappy!  ive just read katies blog, and alot of it is about how down ive made her and how depressed she is. i never ment to hurt her! i really do love her! i just have found everything really hard recently! its like the little things! like the other day i was sittin in the sports cafe with them, n rather than tlkin to me katie was off tlkin to simon. which, yea i no theres nothing wrong with that coz he's absolutly lovely, but it wasnt that long after we broke up, n to be honest i still really liked him....n it hurt....it hurt in the way that others could tlk to him but i couldnt. i no im the one that ended it, but it wasnt because i dont care abotu him! not at all! but because we just didnt really click...not that i even gave it a chance....i dnt know how to explain it... *tear*  that didnt make me in a mood with her! i dont no what was wrong with me.... i started sorting thigs out with her today, coz we need to tlk- i miss her! but she feels i cant open up to her, but some things i jus tcant express....i cant put into words how im feeling and whats going through my mind! it actualy drives me crazy! it builds up more and more untill i loose my mind! the last weeks been hell at home coz ive not really been here spiritually...i was hurting and depressed so i blocked the world out and hibinated into a world of myown- to then have my parents shouting at me because i never tlk to them...dahh i wasnt tlkin to anyone! but they have to revolve everything around them...*bitterness*  i cant stop crying. im sitting here in my corner with tears streeming down my cheaks, trying to hide it from my parents. but then when i try to think why, i cant define it! its like a worldwind of emotions, spirling uncontrollabley, sucking me in, pulling me apart....    'i dont want the world to see me, coz i dont think that they'd understand'  i cant get these lyricks out of my head! for the last few weeks i wake up...i put this song on...i shower n i sing this :$:$:$.....i got to bed n i listen to it! i think it's now part of my world! a part of me, lyricly trying to understand myself before i attempt to make others understand me! in a way i wish i could get into my brain, so i could try to figure myself out. i think im a bitch. i always manage to hurt the ppl who mean so much to me. i mean i hurt simon, pete and sam all together! go me:|:|:| now ive hurt katie. itry not to think about it coz i hate the thought of people being upset because of me! ive been upset enough to no what its like. normally i try my best to go out my way to make people smile and feel wanted- like the lil things like runnin up n randomly huggin em! its dumb but when someone does it to u, esp. someone who loves you, you feel like your priceless! it makes your heart bounce and makes you feel soo wanted and loved! *EAK!* :$:$:$ well i hope it does.... ive neva actually asked ppl..:S :$:$:$ but thats how i feel!i love being made to feel special and i love even more making other people feel special! especially when they are as special to me as katie and all my close ppl are to me! its my way of expressing that i love them. i dont know what id do if i lost any of them..i dont think i could deal with it! n i keep thinkin what if...what if id neva met kim n ppl, n waht if i hadnt gone to bhasvic! i would b stuck in the tiersome circle at blatch.....pretend to be someone im not to fit in...leak abit of me-age...them notice abit of me and see how they dont like the real me...so i get rejected for being who i am.....endless pain and depressin...lost identity...lost soul trapped in a world of fakeness and unwantedness. all i ever wanted was to fit in! but they never understood that because i wasnt like them! if i was still at blatch i would still be arguing,still be crying, still be hurting. there were endless weeks of getting home from school to lock myself in my room crying in a corner for hours, and other times sitting in tears telling my mum how much i hate my life and how much i want to die more than anything! its not natural for a school girl to wanna kill herself! but thats how much i wanted to be accepted and wanted!  *opps got off the point abit:S i doont even know where that came from, but it came with alot of tears and emotion. i take i didnt let out all my emotions about this stuff so it was still bunged up:S:S *blushes* i seriously dont know where any of this comes from! its like i put my music on really loud through my headsets n jus ttype..i start to type n i jus tcant stop! im not thinkin about any of it! i hav 2 go back and read it jus tto find out what oi put (and to try and correct some of the many mistakes!)  k so where was my point?! oooo! yea if i hadnt gone to bhasvic then i wouldnt hav such good friends- wouldnt hav met my new ppl and wouldnt have got so muchcloser with katie and liana! i couldnt, and wouldnt want to imagine my life without them...because its just a horrible thought!  its actually really strange! i like it at college! i wake up..and instead of eargh school! its yay college! not my lessons of course! (appart from media n photography) but for my free's and jus tbecause i feel so wanted because my friends are so amazing! i no that sounds dumb, but even if we dont tlk that much theres jus tsomthing there that shows how mch we care about eachother, and for once in my life i actually feel like i fit in by being myself! n im gradually getting more confidence- not ashamed to be me, so ill invole myself and get myself noticed more for being me! altho i still find it so hard! some days i get to college and im just like.....omg everyones staring at me...i look such a mess...thats y they're stairing at me...they're judgin me....they all hate me...!!! n of course no one is actually staring at me....coz i mean i me so y shouod they! there are some amazinly gorgeous ppl at college! you see them and jus tfeel completly inadequite! its taking soo much for me to actually get some confidence! most people cant understand me, because theyve never been like me...they dont look and feel like i do so they dont feel as insecure and disgusting as i do! people always say they understand, but they couoldnt possible!its on of those things you can only feel if you've been there! empathising doesnt work! thats y ive hurt myself as muc has i hav, not for the pain, but because i hate how i look (in my fits of phyconess) i always feel inadiquite and worthless! however much effort i put in! theres always everyone else who looks, acts and is better! thats one reason i love having a blog, i feel i can tell al of this and it cant respond! coz if this was one of my friends i was tlkin to then they would be sayin o no thats not tru ure better.....blaahh do blaahh! coz they think its the right thing to say!but really its not! ppl think complements will make things better, buit they just make things more doubtfull!

      sams just left. was tlkin to him online and he knew how depresed i was so he came up. it was good. i really needed a hug! and he seemed to know just the right hugs to give me to cheer me up. so im not so eargh must die kinda thing. i think he thought i was suicidal...fun. i wont deny it, but i dont have the guts to do anything.....  he's got a new lady friend- not officially but he's working on it. it really hurts. because yet again i know her. its like he cant completly move on to someone completely new! its charlie mcmillan. o the joy. i mean she's really sweet....but y cant he go for someone i dont know?! i mean me n sam originally got together the evenin the charlie lost her v! we were there! (obviously not in the room, that'd b gross!) we were upstairs watchin a film n on her trampoline n they were...busy...! but for him to now go for her?! it really relaly hurts!   i mean, i know that ive moved on (obviously) coz im with pete and its great, and i dont expect him to be single forever....but i supose a part of me must still love him abit, not mch, just lil bit...and it hurt because i no her! it woud be fine if it was a stranger! but its not! and she links to our past! we got close at her house! therefor she's part of our history and now he wants her!!! im gettin flustered again.

      ive just got home from my band concert...goody! i arrived just after 7, thinkin it started at 7.30....to arive to the wonderful sounf of the band! yes i was wrong- it started at 7! so i went rushing in, shirt undone, no bowtie and almost in tears!(not from lateness...from life!)! what a great start! so i was so looking forward to playin! i didnt actually have to play much coz dean played it- he's actually incredible! his band played 'basketcase' (amazin song!!) and he was just...omw! i couldnt help but feel a nothing..theres just no need for me to be there! i just get in the way....  so many times my eyes just randomly welled up and i wanted to run out crying! but then id remember....im in a concert! fun. all those peopl stairing...i couldnt let them c my upset, its just not what i do. mum tryed to tlk to me about it in the break, but i nearlystarted to cry again so ran off= to then hav my ankle play up! i seriously just wanted to die! and i told mum that. neva a gd move! but the can=can solo went well! but my 3rd blister popped. nice.  work was dreadful! i couldnt focus, i was completly in a world of depression and every fkin customer was a size 8! but instead of wanting to hurt them i just wanted to hurt myself! we're progressing! its quite unbelievable how much i wanted to die today! i couldnt deal with it! so much that people could tell i was down- which always shows its quite major coz i can normally hide it quite well.   then when we finished the concert, i turned my phone on and found a text from katie, saying how 'she knows i dont seem to want to tlk to her which is upsetting, but thats just me!' i just burst into tears when i read this!coz she always does this! everytime im down she makes me feel bad for not tlkin to her and how im hurting her bcoz i dont confide in her...she doesnt get that i have nothing to tlk about! she makes it so personal to her, but i have nothing to tlk about! im depressed. i wanna die. nothing else to it! why cant she just deal with it? i do!! depression= fact no explination needed! but of course im a fucking bad friend because i dont run straight to her and tell her all about it! but all about what?!?! i dont get it! but she hurts me with the texts she sends me about how she's upset that i wont tell her! eargh!!! its going round in circles! but i sooo cant deal with this right now!   it just adds on to my crapp, uselessness as a person! im even a crap friend!! i try so hard to make ppl feel wanted, coz i rly no what its like not to b! but its hard when ppl only notice the slightly negative things- they're not even negative things! but just not as exagerated and flamboiant as i normally am with my ppl! so if im not an eager loving ova the top friend then therefor i have a problem with them! but i dont exactly get mch bac! yea course i do feel loved, but sometimes i just feel that the zest that boosts my overlovingness with katie is her expectation for it and not so mch in return! im not even sayin i want more! i dont really know what im saying coz i cant think straight or see straight oz im all flustered again! and now im gonna have katie upset with me for writtin this and for the text i just sent her and i cant deal with any more crap in my life atm! i feel bad enough as it is and its gonna push me too far.... im gonna go now coz i dont want the parents seeing me this upset...thats all i need! i dont wanna upset ppl! but its as though im not alowed to be upset coz it upsets others! i just wanna b alone!

      todays been....well in theory good! but in reality,  emotionally unstable and depressing!   college was ok, only haf 2 lessons- last ones b4 our exams:S n found out that for media course work we got the highest they eva give- 58/60 !!!(i personally got 110/120!!) and theres a possiility that we're up for nomination for the bhasvictus! but ive felt v.depressed again- and emotional again, like i was last week! its like my emotions have gone in a circle- they got better to suddenly get worse again! apparently its because of the new pills im on n a mixture of drugs and hormones...goody! so together they equal weeks of depression and sorrow....  so its rather crappy realy! ive just been feelng  unexplainably down and own-worldly!  i couldnt explain what was wrong because that part of the overwhelming sence of wanting to be invisible was still hidden deep down, so not even i could reach it, let alone others.   in our free i noticed simon looking really down, so obviously i want just gonna leave him, so i went to c him, but he wouldnt really talk, so me, maisie n kim dragged him (and his chair) into guppy, so we could lock him in the dark n make him tell us! and he did! which was good, because we didnt force him, but he did tell us, so he must feel almost comfortable talking to us! its always good when people confide in you and tell u how they feel!   this evening, at band i was actually..happy..happy..v.happy....depressed! i was watching dean play, and o my word he's like soo good! so then i got thinking and realised how crap i am! not just at drums, but at  everything!!  i mean what is the point in me really?!  i have no usp!! nothing!  to get places in life u have to have a good usp, be unique, or just be amazing at something! and im just not! im not intellegant(understatement!!) i have no future prospects, im fat n disgusting, i cant seem to get anything right, various health yuckynesses and im not even a good drummer! people say i am either a) to make me feel better n get more confidence, or b) coz they dont no any better! it doesnt work!! i just feel that im a  lost soul , a  wasted spirit  with no path, no direction! i dont no where im going or what i want because im not good enough at something which wil help with anything....im just   not good enough in general    i feel  inadequate  and a waste of space to be honest! dunno y im being honest, doesnt matter anyway! im fed up of feeling like this! it hurts, physically and mentally....it hurts that i see people who are everything i want to be and more, and...nobody seems to be able to understand..but it just... realy hurts to be me ! and i cant fking stop crying!!! eargh! kill me now! *you cant stop the tears that are coming* Vx

      a friend of mine wrote this...  Depressed, dejected Wanting to die Yet all I have the guts to do Is sit alone and cry  I can pick up the knife I can mark out the place As I start to dig Tears stream down my face  A cloudy fog of doubt Overwhelms my mind Incomplete and all alone My entire life goes blind  I’m pathetic I’m a wimp Can’t deal with the bloodstained thought Of my entire body going limp And crashing to the floor  So I sit here on my bed Trying to disappear Morbid thought fill my head All I wish is to be dead  To die would be bliss The pain sheer relief The sight of blood relaxing Yet for people I love just grief  I imagine the world through your eyes Finding me blood-covered on the floor I can feel your heart as it dries And sense your soul as it cries   But would you actually mourn for the loss Would you really cry for my pain Will you reminisce on the past we had Our endless wonders in the rain   I didn’t do it because of you It was a selfish deed I had to do it, had to get out My spirit had to be freed  But yet they are just wishes Of how it could be I wish I could not feel I yearn not to be me  The worse my feelings get The deeper I have to scratch I cannot let them heal They are all that is real  Scratching is as far as I go Because I stopped myself again Back to the beginning I always go Then round the endless circles again  One day I’ll be brave And my time on earth will end But I’ll keep my feelings hidden away Always until then  impressed?! can she feel anymore like me?!

      its strange. ive been feeling surprisingly down lately. ive now mastered the art of hiding it from the few people who care, but i really feel it when im at home. everyone have their own ways of dealing with depression...i dont think i should be judged for mine... if it makes you feel better then why not?! lol its not like im the only one! i soo soo want to vanish. *pooof* and dissapear! the question is who would notice? and of those who notice who will do anthing about it?! im just feeling very....i dont even know how to explain it......i feel like giving up onthe world...turning my back on it and leaving forever... or more turning my back on me, and never have to see myself again... that would b amazin...to look in the mirror and see someone else...engenious. i would love to live a day in the body of someone who has all that i wish i had,,and for them to try living a day being me. although i dont like sympathy and its destened when you think i have a lifetime stuck being me...o the fun. i dont really know what im going on about...just a random trail of thought that like most i will absorb into my inner part and morn for the life i can only wish for.....

      Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) You had a crap weekend and you're ready to say, "Fuck it! I'm stocking up on vibrators and/or porn and becoming a shut-in!" We recommend holding off on the self-imposed seclusion. This week you have four planets stacked up in your true love sector, so you're destined to catch the eye of someone who's ready and willing to indulge in some of your more, let's just say, peculiar fantasies. The 26th will be your best date night yet, with Cupid planning a sneak attack that will leave you sore in a good kind of way. Cupid's arrows could easily be coming from behind, so don't panic if, when you're out and about, the new object of your affection doesn't materialize in front of you. Vx

      ok..major emo turn! i cant b at home and not b depressed! which is crappy coz im not unhappy at home or owt..im just unhappy with myself!   today was good, only one and a bit lessons..always gd! went to newman to visit ben and luke- when i was merry i remembered him to be hot...and he is! lol. we also saw dave and joe, it was gd. altho they said i was flirtin with dave...i so wasnt!! we the met chris n went to his house, when we were tlkin with him n mary(his adorable sis) she was like...o u might no our cousin sophie!! :| out of anyone it had to be her. goody. i was like..hmmm yea i no her abit...as in she wants my bf! i wasnt bitter at all.....:S   i love being in this corner on the comp, coz i have my headset on and just want to dissapear from the world...well i do dissapear untill my parents start talkin to me! i wish i could like make a black box around me so im completly cut off! we've got a new assienment for photography...like a mini project about revealing inner me...do i rly wanna do that?! id rather do it litually and cut myself open to show...head guts!! lol! (lil kimmy thing bless her...we all have head guts in our heads, not brains!lol) but anyway...i like the topic...but it'll b tricky. you can do like fragmented dreams...so i might interlink all the scarey things that goes on im my mind with dreams....coz ppl knowing that theyre real would jst b wierd!  i was thinkin of mayb doing some to show lonelyness n stuff...but i dunno...coz it would b like impossible to get someone to pose and act like i feel..coz they woldnt understand coz they're not me! so if hav to photograph myself...which is iccky coz im horrible and unphotographic! ill break the camera! i have a few ideas...but i dunno..it'd b hard to do alone but imbarracin to do with ppl!altho maisie n kim i can tell anything to...i dont think they'd understand coz i couldnt imagine them ever feeling like this.... see how emo am i being?! n i actually am gonna go and sit in the dark and cry now!  i havnt spent enough time with pete lately...things feel as tho they've changed...only a bit...but it kinda worries me..coz that was the startin point of me n sams last break up...he got wierd n distant! its just like lil things thathave changed...meaningless to most ppl..but i notice! n i dont no what to do. coz with sam, he got distant..he wouldnt admit anything but i new something was up..i could just tell! so i thought that if i put in more effort then he might go back to normal..but instead he got worse...n worse.. i new there was someone else...i could see it in his eyes...not all the time, jus little hints every so often..and then when we broke up it hurt even more.... so i dont rly no what to do...coz if i dont put the extra effort, like i havnt been then nor does he! he doesnt seem to be makin so mch effort...but that might b coz im not...but then what if i put more in and try n get closee to him and the same thing happens?! do i just push ppl away?! or just put them off?! it must be something, coz things seem to always change in the same way... n its hurting already! n it doesnt help havin rly close friends of mind tellin me i sldnt b with him n always sayin things against him...it does hurt coz he is still my bf, n matter if others like it or not!

       Aquarius:   If you use your imagination, you could successfully transform aspects of your closest relationships in order to accommodate your future needs. After a lot of thought and deliberation, you know now that you are ready for a change in direction and others will be incredibly supportive. As long as you take other people’s needs into consideration, you will achieve a great deal. Do all you can to sort out emotional commitments. Vx

      i cant take this anymore! for the last....four hours ive been crying...and they're not even startin to slow down! i had a shitty day at work-got very very depressed coz of thin fkin bitches and gorgeous grls etc! i very nearly burst into tears serveral times at work- how perfessional would that look?!?! i felt very ill, depressed and kept goin giddy...and i had like an oooba bad headache! so all i wanted to do was get home, sit down and mayb even hav a nap! but....no course i cant!  i got home, my feet were killin me, i had cramp in my leg and my headache got about 100 times worse. so i sat on the couch, and as i hadnt gone in to dad to see him and make a bit song and dance over him, he came into the lounge. all i said to him was that i had a bad headache - ive been in a kimmy ppl hatin mood but i didnt even say it mooodily! and he storms out shouting a cursing and slammin the doors.  what had i done?! apparently i had a bad attitude and gave him a horrible look....course it was a fkin horrible look i had a fkin stabbing pain in my brain! so of course as i was feeling comp. shit anyways i burst into tears and ran up to be on my own whilst i can hear mum and dad arguing downstair. why do i need this the minute i get home?! i was soo upset!   and then he just upn left! no phone, no money, no car and a bad ancle. and he just vanished! leaving mum and me rly rly upset and no idea where he was! how can he make us feel guilty and bad for somehting he's done!? a car then pulled up with him in...hrs later whilst mum was on the way back from the park lookin for him. i mean what right does he have to treat us like this?! nxt time it'll be me walking out and i hope he gets alot more worried than we were! we're still not tlkin. he says he's had enough of my attitude and the fact i dont tlk to him and he doesnt feel involved in my life...coz im suposed to find gkin time to fkin tlk to him inbetween college, work, revisoin and band?!?! i dont know what to do! he's now said he's given up and sayin how he's gonna leave...so yet again its me thats caused the argumens and all the problems! whats the point of me?! im ruining their life- mums like sooo upset coz they're not tlkin.   if i wasnt here they wouldnt b arguing and their lifes would be happier! both of them wont be feeling like they are now and nor will i! it'd solve everything! ive always been the one that causes all the arguments, deaj never does....they'd be so much happier without me! and then i wouldnt be crying! my eyes hurt. and my headache's got worse. i just want to die. its not alot to ask for! its salvation for everyone!

      seriously wierd and freaky! yesterday morning, i woke up, but then kinda fell into an unconsious dreamworld which felt and looked like reality! it was like a really really bad evil shower moment.  it started at the beach pty..which is why it seemed so realistic! because in my dreamthing i was upset with drunken pete so went to sit on my own on the prominade and was lying down watchin the stars just by the peace statue. as it was dark i couldnt be seen and i was in my own world, so when a white ford transit van wanted to drive down there they didnt see me, and ran me over. i think luke shouted look out so i sat up and it hit me and then completly ran over me.  the thing that makes it even more real is the fact that when i saw pete like that i fif want to just go and dit up there on my own, but ended up goin wonderin with the girls and luke, and when we came back we were all standing at the peace statue and a white transit van came along there and luke pushed us all out of the way so we didnt get run over! its just soo real! coz it could've easily happened..and every bit of detail was identical!  luke then rang an ambulance and my parents and i was taken to hospital. there was nothin they could do for me..i was dying slowly-internal bleeding as id been crushed. as there was nothing they could do i was inthe hospital bed gradually deteriarating. i knew i was going to die, and i knew i would never be able to see my friend and all the people i love again- coz they didnt know anything about the acident, coz of course it wasnt exactly mum and dads imediate reaction after finding their daughter was dying! so i wrote goodbye letters, one to my girlies, including little bits for pete and different people to be read out to all, and one to my parents. instead of the distant dream thing, kinda heres one i did earlier and pull out a letter, i went through the wholem word by word making corrections and adding personal bit...it was exactly what i would write if i found i was dying right now!  for mum and dad, to tell them how i felt i not only wront a letter to them, but i expressed my feelings in a poem to them...again i actually wrote the poem in my sleep and could remember it when i woke up...its abit sketchy, but i did write it in my sleep!     My Dying Goodbye  I'm sorry if I hurt you I'm sorry I make you cry my time has come for me to leave so this is my goodbye. I know I made you angry and I know I made you mad but now I'm gone I'd hate to leave You always looking sad. I never really got to say how much you mean to me you really were amazing parents the best they'll ever be. I love you both with all my heart I'm too young to have to go But with my depart they'll always be the love i didnt always show.  I'm sorry that i have to go I'm sorry I'm leaving this way I'm sorry i won't appear at the door smiling and saying 'hay'. I'll miss how safe you made me feel and you always being there without you I feel lost and weak cause' I'm alone and feeling scared. I love you more than the world itself and I'll miss you more everyday I wish I could have more time to care I wish that I could stay. Cause now I'm starting to get scared what am I going to do? I'm going to a place far far away I dont want to be without you! But i will be brave, i will be strong cause' my future wasnt ment to be whenever you feel sad and alone you can always talk to me.  Mum and dad i love you I'll watch over you every day I'll keep you safe and happy and be listening to what you say. I'm sorry i never listened before I'm sorry i dissobayed i never did anything when you said It always had to be my way. But this isnt the way i want I dont like saying goodbye this is the hardest one I've had to do Because today I'm going to die. So with this my feelings i hope you know you know I'd never lie I'll never forget you, I love you so much But this is my dying goodbye.     see its rather sketchy, but the fact i wasnt consious at the time makes it abt more impressive...and the fact i ment and meanit all!  i then died..which obviously was inevitable! the feeling of dying wasnt actually there tho- i didnt feel myself go, it kinda skipped to when i was dead and going to tell my loved ones (not me myself obviously!)  so it was mum, she was in the car n picked up chloe from blatch- insisted she had to be here coz it was important- none off them even knew i was in an accedent. so they went to the sports cafe, it was buzzin and loud as usual!  when mum walked up to our group they all kinda went sillent and still when they saw mums red, puffy tear stained eyes, but people who wernt with us didnt so were still rly loud, so kim randomly jummped up and screamed 'shut up everyone!' coz they couldnt rly hear mum tlk! very unkim-like...but it could happen! mum then told them briefly what happened, quickly gave them the letter and hurried off in tears. kim, mais and clo then read the letter as everyone listened shocked into silence.  pete wasnt there tho. i think it was a late start for him or something, so when he walked into the s.cafe late it was full of sympethetic eyes stairing at him, expecting him to have already known. it was horrible. then i woke up in tears!my pillows were absolutly drenched, because as i was writting the letters and poem in my dream i was crying....but i was actually crying in reality as well! very very strange! it was soo soo unbelievabley real! i couldnt stop crying when i woke up!i was totally spun out! it was that real!    urlLink    Family is so important to me&nbsp;   Vx

and the only one of your friends i even talk to katie, and thats like once every full moon, Just to lert you know the whole world doesnt revolve around you so does that mean anyone you know i cant talk to..... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bye Vicky&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;    &nbsp; hurtfull?! i thoguht so! i ran coz it hurt to stay...i argue coz it hurts to tlk and think about him atm. so i can just be left to cry over him once again. lol im normally ok at not reactin to emails n stuff...but that hurt soo soo much! i dont even understand why! but...yea if his aim with it was to hurt me he rly rly succeeded...   ive  kinda been bottlin things again. its not good. it builds up and i get stuck in vicky world! like goin off n just thinkin....but not really thinkin anything particular...everythings just kinda blurrey! i actually rly needed pete to hug me when im down but he's not here:( i hav got barnaby tho! *the huge amazinly great teddy i got him for his bday!* so i can hug him.  i thought i was gettin better- being happy..thinkin happy thoughts, but it seems that no matter what i do or how i feel my hatrid for me just gets bigger and bigger and stronger! in a sence its taken over! i would write about it..but for once im actually ashamed! although i dont think i should be ashamed because i cant stop myself cozwhen i do it, its like ive been tken over and it doesnt feel like me! i just have the scars.... i dont rly wanna tlk about it coz it....upsetting! and im feelin rly emotional again! the thoughts in my head hav got so bad i even thought of telin my parents and getting them to fix me....but i just cant bring myself to do it! if im ashamed then how will they feel?! they'll never understand! they read my suicie diary and were disgusted and ashamed. they didnt understand at all n apparently they were ry worried coz they thought i was suicidal *dahh* but what did they do?! mum tried to tlk to me once...but i clammed up...so she gave up! there is no way they'd ever ever understand me! they'd just think im pathetic! which i think...but i cant stop myself! i dont wanna do it! but when i go into these hatrid moods i cant not do it! i wouldnt have written all the stuff in my project if id never felt it..if i didnt feel it! people have read it n asked about it- like paula my photography teacher...but how can i tlk to her?! coz its not like i feel it all the time coz i can block it out when im in public!  tlkin to tom's helped...i wanna tlk more to him about it but i feel wierd! how do u bring up a delicate subject like that?! its just wierd. so therefore im just alone! i cant tlk so i bottle up...it builds up higher n higher. im all alone so i cant stop myself...im not strong enough on my own coz its gettin worse....and now we hav tears again! hmmm gonna go! not dealin well   &nbsp;  Vx
