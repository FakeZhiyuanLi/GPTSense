         &nbsp;&nbsp; Well I am not sure what to write here but I guess I will just talk about nothing. Well tonight I have to go to church youth group. It will be boring if hardly anybody comes, but there are only 7 people that come on a regular basis, but there are 2 others that come occasionally. We are going to go to TYL Camp in August. It should be pretty fun, especially the car rides back and forth. I'm kinda nervous about not really having any friends going with me except my older sister, Chelsea, who is 3 years older than me, and is can be pretty mean, and can do some damage even with her 5' 3" size. Compared to my 5' 8 1/2" size.       &nbsp;&nbsp; My Grandma Judy came on Saturday and she is staying a week with us. Yesterday we went to the Mall of America. It was pretty fun.     I got 2 CDs, Newsboys Remixed, and Maria Mena single, You're the Only One. They are both really good! Especially newsboys. They are a Christian group and they are the first of that genre to enter my abundant collection, speaking of abundant I need to get another CD case, mine is overflowing! Actually the 2 I have are overflowing. And I was planning on getting the Ashlee Simpson CD tomorrow when I go to Wal-Mart with Heather! I really want that one, and N.E.R.D.'s latest, Fly or Die. I LOVE the song She Wants to Move! It is AWESOME! You should go on  urlLink www.n-e-r-d.com  and check it out!       &nbsp;&nbsp; Well that is about it for today! I shall inform you of the huge changes in my life if they ever happen!&nbsp; Gotta go!      &nbsp;

           &nbsp;&nbsp; Well i finally got home on Saturday! yay! i had a TON of fun with my friend Ashley Luhman, she lives in Illinois where i used to live, i got to go to Memphis, TN with her and her family! I got to see Elvis's house and stuff, it was pretty cool! After we got back from Memphis and Graceland we had to get her 4-H projects done. She had NOTHING done and fair was in a couple of days!&nbsp;We&nbsp;had to do her sewing outfit, her dog training, cat, buying outfit and poster, and her car model!   It was pretty stressful, but we had fun! She may go to State Fair on her modeling.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I leeft her house I went to my Grandparents house and stayed there with my little sister Molly because it was her 10th birthday and my mum thought i should stay with her. So I listened to my Mum like the good girl that I am! yeah, right! jk We got to go to Monical's to eat for her b-day! It is this GREATLY, DELICIOUSLY, EXCELLENTLY, SUPERB, pizza place.&nbsp;TI has the BEST thin crust cheese pizza on the face of the Earth! TI is especially good wiht their French and Ranch dressing on it! you should try it sometime! It is to die for!!! seriously! it is the best! The bad part is that they are only in Danville, Watseka, Champaign, and other small Illinois towns! So if yuo go to east-central illinois anytime be sure to go there and get the Family Pleaser! It is THE BEST! no joke! and if you happen to go to Danville or Champaign you can get dessert at Custard Cup! IT has THE BEST lemon hard custard! i get it every time we go to Danville. (Danville is the cheaper one) But enough with food... lol!    &nbsp;&nbsp; We stayed there until Saturday then we came home to wonderful Waseca! yeah, right! Right after I got home we had to go to Aaron and Anthony Ingram's house for dinner. We stayed there until like 12:30 in the morning. We had fun. FYI: Aaron is NOT very good at plaing Sppons! He loost practically every game, he's just too slow! lol!    &nbsp;&nbsp; Then yesterday after church me, Chelsea, mum, and Virginia (Aaron &amp; Anthony's mom) went to Mankato to go shopping! We had fun! It was pretty funny all the stuff we did! Chelsea decided she wasnted some jeans but they were for guys but she wanted them anyway...we also got Aaron the same pair of jeans cause they are the same size! It was pretty funny! But dont tell Aaron cause then he wont wear them! After we got back we stayed at their house for a while until we all had to go to church for youth group. After that we went back to their house adn hung out and watched TV and stuff. Then at like 10 or something we came home! well thats my boring life and i better get back to cleaning my room! ttyl! love always!!!!

        VBS ended out pretty well, surprisingly! When Dan and I were with one of the groups for recreation though we were rolling down the hill and the kids persuaded me to roll down the hill too, and i guess i was too close to the wall and at the very end i rolled kinda into it! It kinda hurt and my clothes got some grass stains on them of course! o well! they will hopefully wash! But it wasnt as bad as when Dan Justice was chasing Bret Huisenga during Steal the Flag and Dan ran into the big bushes and got stains and dist all over his right side which was hilarious because he even got stains in his armpit! Which is quite a feat (sp?). But the whole day ended up pretty fun.      Yesterday Kaitlynn and Alicia, Aaron and Anthony's younger sisters came over and ended up spending the night. Kaitlynn is soo cute and she had me paint her nails a turquoise color, but it kept getting smudged because she wouldn't sit still! o well! But she had me redo them this morning. So it looks pretty good.      We FINALLY got the lists with addresses of people from TYL! I have been waiting for it for a week! It took me a LONG time to add the people but it is cool to talk to them again!      Chelsea went to Illinois on Saturday and won't be back until the 28th. Gives me a break from her! Yes! Sweet, Sweet, Freedom! It is so refreshing! haha      I think that's all there is to say for now! Love always to all people!

         Well today went fairly well. I woke up late this morning so i had to take a REALLY quick shower (at least for me it was quick). After that I had to hurry to church to help get ready for vacation bible school for today. Luckily the escapees only went outside once today when they weren't supposed to, but Anthony and Dan went and got them to come back in. So i didn't have to stress over them getting hit by a car again today! Yay! Today's color was blue, so i wore my Waseca sweatshirt. Yesterday it was purple and the day before it was yellow. Tomorrow it is green. I am not sure what to wear tomorrow. Oh well! The day I am really worried about coordinating with is Friday which is red. I have NOTHING that is red, pink maybe, but red, not quite. If need be I can ask Chelsea for some clothes. It is SOOOO cold this week! I can not believe how cold it is for what time of the year it is! Back in Indiana it is usually in the 80s or 90s! I love warm weather like that! Not cold 50s and 60s! But enough with the whining....I can't think of what else to talk about so I will go now! love always!

           Well I got back from TYL camp on Saturday and today is Tuesday so i have been home for almost 3 full days. It was a blast! I have a friend form Owatonna, Jacia, and luckily she went so i had someone other than my sister there that i could hang out with! yeah! I was very happy! so we were there for a week and we got to swim in this lake and it was A LOT cleaner than Clear Lake here in Waseca! I was soo happy! it was so much fun because they had this thing on the lake called 'The Blob' and it was one of those huge pillow trampoline things that you jump on from a ladder and then scoot to the end and then get bounced off from the next person in line! It was fun except that i only stayed on it once, i kept slipping off the side and falling into the lake. But it was still fun the time i did get to go off the end! it was really a great experience over-all and i got to meet a ton of really cool people. There was a girl from Germany, Benita,  in my cabin and we hung out a lot throughout the week. She knew a lot of English but the phrases she used someimes were funny. I learned a few new words in german that are fun to say and i learned about their culture which was really cool. And YES they do shave their legs AND arm-pits! no worries ladies! As Benita would say, "Of Course we do!" (with her german accent). I love her accent! it was soo cool! But anyway...    This week I am helping with the recreation part of vacation bible school at my church. The little kids can be demon children sometimes! rrrrrrrg! 3 kids this morning right before closing time decided to run outside and roll down the hill! So of course i run out there to try and round them up! but they dont come, so i have to chase them around the church and try to keep them form climbing on the ladders and running into the middle of the street! i was about to yell at them and stuff-but i didnt! they made me so mad though! rrrrrr! but i will get over it! Well that is about it and if you want to know more about camp ask me later... I am soo exhausted! Love always!
