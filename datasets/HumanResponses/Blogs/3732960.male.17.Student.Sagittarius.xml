      how odd are we all? keeping an online journal so anybody who's anybody can find out what we're doing on a day to day basis. id say we all never got enough attention when we were younger....  im bored... i could really go for a smoke, but its raining outside and that sucks.  lets see... whatd i do friday... i met up with kels at 2:25ish to go to work the phish show at 3 at alpine. so we saw kreger at the show and did nothing (and got paid for it) for like 2 1/2 hours. then my team leader forgot about me, so i didnt get a break till 10ish. i bummed a cig from some chick and it was a lite, so that lasted me all night until after everything was done and we were goin home at like 120 in the morning when i went up to some other girl and asked to bum one of her camels which she did give me. so then i went home and my sis was home from college and we sat in our driveway and smoked a cig and she told me how horrible her date went. then we went inside and talked about Bonaroo (cuz she went) over a beer. then i went to bed cuz i had to work at steins the next day.  which brings us to saturday. i went to work from 1230 - 9pm and during the day me jamie and katie decided we'd hang out. so after work i came home and took a shower and called them up and they came and picked me up. so we drove around and smoked 2 bowls of katies dank ass nugs, and then went to dennys. in the car, the 3 of us were geekin. so when we got into dennys, jamie went to the bathroom and when the waitress came, me and katie geeked for like 10 minutes (which was bad) cuz it was so obvious we were fuckin ripped. then one of our bosses from steins walked in with his girlfriend around 11 and we were like oh fuck. but nothin bad happened. later when i started getting tired and we were all done eating, katie went to the bathroom and jamie was like "youre tired arent you" and i said yea but i still wanted to hang out with em cuz i didnt wanna seem like i was having a bad time or anything, which i wasnt, but jamie was like "dude its no big deal, cuz i know you have to work at 9 tomorrow". my ripped ass was like ok. so they dropped me off at home and me and my dog sat around till like 130 watching shitty TV.   which gets us to sunday. i went to work at 9 (till 1) and it went by surprisingly fast. when i first got there jamie told me about how her and katie accidentally ran somebody off the road cuz jamie was fuckin around in her car and not looking and she ended up in the wrong lane, which made me laugh. then i went and worked till i got to leave.   cool thing happened this weekend. i found out jamie likes horror movies and reading about true murderers and stuff. which was really cool, cuz i like that shit too... i love scaring the shit outta myself for some odd reason. so anyway, jamie let me borrow a couple of books she has about scary people that were murderers. then i went home and took a shower and me and my brother went to best buy, circuit city, and soundwaves. i bought dead or alive 2:hardcore cuz its one of the only videogames i actually like, Gia, and donnie darko. and that brings me to this very moment... queens of the stoneage "No one knows" is playing. i like that song.

       PRETTY SHITT!   lets see, everyday i have to wake up at 9 to get ready and go to summer school. then every couple of days i get to come home, take a 2 hour nap, then go work at Steins. and i have to devote a large handful of weekends to working at alpine valley (music theater) and thats not really fun, cuz you get there at like 11 in the morning and dont get to go home till 1 or 2 AM the next day! last year was pretty fun cuz we got to do whatever we wanted there, but now they changed everything and you dont get to walk around everywhere, you have to stay in one parking lot, and you get switched around, so sometimes you're working in the show but the only plus to that is you KINDA get to see the show, but the shitty thing is youre checking tickets and standing ALL NIGHT LONG.   so its not even worth trying to go out and party or anything cuz if its during the week i have to get up at 9 and go to school and then go work at steins, and if its a weekend im working at either steins or alpine!   now i know what youre all thinking.. yea but youll have money... WRONG! i still owe my dad like $450-$500 for car insurance and a large chunck of the rest goes into savings... FUCK SCHOOL, FUCK WORK, FUCK DEBT....this summer sucks

      the life i used to have. my freshman year, i had two or three really close friends who would come over EVERY weekend and drink and smoke at my house. seriously for 6 months straight all we did was go in my basement and take shots and then around midnight we'd head outside and do stupid shit all night. we'd sit in cait's car and smoke or take walks down the road and smoke out of our homemade bongs and shit (occasionally we had a pipe) but thats besides the point. now everyone is stupid and doesnt know how to have fun. one of the close friends i had cant smoke or drink anymore because his girlfriend wont allow it and the others all graduated and have work everyday and shit... and im only a senior.  I started talking to my one of my friends again today. Monica AKA monular. we went to school together freshman year, then she moved and now she goes to a different school. but hey at least we started talking again.  this year i had to "buckle down" and worry about grades and stuff cuz i want to go to college and be able to support myself when im older, but i just missed constantly being high and drunk. ive only smoked three times in the past 2 weeks... if this were a couple years ago... i couldnt have gone 2 weeks without smokin at least once a day, and im not talking one bowl, im talking fucking RIPPED off my ass. and one of the best nights of my life was when i was on x.... everything was so fucking awesome, i felt sooo good and everyone was having a good time. i miss shroomin too...  you know youre good and fucked up when your living room starts getting smaller and smaller. heh.   last year was kinda like that. but i always make friends with older people and then they go and graduate. i had a good share of my drunk and high times, and now my BEST friend in the world is moving away and getting married aug. 21st and the rest of them are all going to school and working everyday. this sucks...im going to bed.

      im bored.  i hate all that lord of the rings shit. granted, ive never seen or read any of the stories... its all just so "dungeons and dragons"-ish and all that shit is stupid (in my opinion). Im not a big fan of the whole harry potter craze either, same with all that Pokemon shit... never liked it at all. I played it once, and had absolutely no idea what anything meant, so i stopped. Fun things are easy to follow. No complicated story lines or any of that shit. Unless youre talkin about the movie memento... now there was a good complicated movie. ive seen it like 5 times now. im listening to "Control" by Puddle of Mudd.... just thought id share. im headin out for a smoke.... be right back (11:22 pm)ok im back (11:26 pm) well that was fun. i've got "Broken" by seether playing now.. good song. My friend Becky is hilarious. she always tells me that the first time she heard me talking was when i was talking to this other girl about drugs and she thought to herself "i hope that kid never talks to me" now we're best friends. I think we get along so well cuz we're both really sarcastic.. about EVERYTHING!                            *AIM CONVERSATION* me: i hope your watching TV er something, cuz i dont have one with cable in here, so if it says somethinglike hey get in yer basement tornado to the fullest... i wouldnt know becky: lol becky: tornado to the fullest becky: is that like the BET weather channel  BET is black entertainment television for all you out there who don't know that. *wink*   i hate living in a small town... and i hate being in high school (only one year left thank god) you're so sheltered from everything, and i hate being naive.

      I planned on starting this thing on monday, but that never happened, so ill go back to the beginning of the week.  fucking summer school started on monday... god damn shit fuck bitch cunt.... ok ive vented. kathy (my better half) left for virginia beach on monday too.. she'll be gone for a week. so yea i woke up and took a shower and got ready for school and i realized i was kinda early. so i called my friend katie up and asked if she wanted to smoke. eventhough she'd just waked n baked she said sure. so i picked her up and we smoked. then i had to go to summer school, so i drove out to bumfuck mukwonago and sat in school for 2 hours... the whole time fidgeting cuz i needed a smoke. after school came home and slept, cuz schwag does that to ya. (Dont get the impression that me and my friends are dirty schwizzo smokers, she got it for free, so what the hell, eh?) then i woke up and called my friend erin and we had to go to the library for a book for my summer school class... then we went to her place and watched the end of Futurama and Family Guy, then i decided to go home  tuesday was shitty. woke up, went to school, came home, watched tv for awhile, then worked 4-9, came home, watched 50 first dates, and went to bed.  that brings us to today. (listenin to the beatles, "Love Me Do" is on) so i had to get up early and get my work permit for alpine valley, and i forgot how long that shit takes and i cant be late for summer school, so i left at 9:15 to get that shit done and got to the place at 9:25ish and realized that all she had to do was sign and photocopy some stuff... so i was going to be hella early to school. i decided to entertain myself and drive out of my way on a cigarette roady.. too bad that only took up 5 minutes of my time. i got to school around 9:40 and sat and ("From me to you" is on now)read from this book SMACK by Melvin Burgess. Its about running away from home and getting addicted to what else... heroin. sounds good, ill keep you all posted. then i came home and watched tv for awhile then listened to music.

       yea so my dad's been being a penis as usual. he always walks around like we're all ruining his life, when in actuality none of us are doing anything wrong. the other day he accused my mom of hiding his bills.... explain this to me somebody!! why would my mom hide HIS BILLS, that she has NOTHING to do with!? (which is exactly what she said to him). Then i hear he's bitching because me and my brothers dont do his yardwork anymore. my ma says he said something along the lines of "Im not doin all this yard work myself, those boys dont do anything around here" or something to that effect... ok, me and my brothers are no longer 10, 12, and 16 years old anymore! we're 17, 19, and 23! we all have more important things to do LIKE OUR JOBS than his yard work. I have summer school every day, and then most of those days, i have to go to work a couple hours later! and then on the weekends im either working one job or the other, or both! i dont have time to do that shit and he knows it. seriously, he just likes bitching and acting like no one is useful except himself, and its really fucking annoying. Im sick of him telling me how im useless and getting a "free ride" because when i was younger, we busted ass helping him with stuff. Sorry dad, that we have lives now.

      Yesterday me and kathy went to lunch after summer school... yes i know, subway is so romantic. Then i went home and slept and she went shopping and to get Sally fixed. When i woke up and got ready, we headed to summerfest. we'd panned on seeing switchfoot. then we decided to keep our options open, cuz we'd both heard "meant to live" 100000 times on the radio, so we were debating between switchfoot, dashboard confessional, and trapt. What did we end up seeing??? NONE OF THEM! We just walked around the whole time. I saw some cool people. Brie, Heikinnen, Menghe, Christina and Sidlarz, Britney, Dan, Chiello, Hannah, and my friend jessica, so that was cool. But the plan was to meet up with some of my other friends and get shit-faced. turns out they decided to leave their cell phone at home, and i didnt find 'em all night. Then we got to the car to go home and got stuck in the parking structure for about 45 minutes, and there were stupid people who kept laying on the horn cuz there was a huge ass traffic jam and it just started to give me a headache, but when their stupidness died down, i was fine. Then me and kathy decided to say fuck you to the huge traffic jam getting on the freeway, and we went the other way.... only problem: we didnt know how to get home that way. Yea Turns out, kathy's a spectacular driver and navigated her way from there to the freeway and we got home around 1:15ish. I made myself a drink (which i'd wanted to do all night) and then kathy decided she should go, cuz she had to work this morning at 9... poor kathy. **Dumbest License Plate: "GV THNX 2"  Thursday I went to school, came home and slept, went to work, then came home and did nothing.  Wednesday I honestly can't even remember what I did.  Tuesday I went to school, then went to kathy's right after and she made me lunch. Then we were bored and decided to go to Soundwaves, then to the mall... i made 4$ (kathy made 6$) take a survey at the mall... it was pretty worth it, cept the lady asking the questions was a fucking crackhead.
