      I just realized that I have to go get my oil changed tomorrow. I have to have a moment of silence for all service memebers (past & present). Study for my computer class (yuck). Maybe I will get a little creative writing in. Oh I know, I can pay some bills. The Lakers play again tomorrow....please Timberwolves win!!   On a weird note: What's the deal with the oil? If we are fightening because we want more oil or cheaper oil, then how come gas is so F****ing expensive? I thought we "controlled" the oil fields according to Al Franken and Janine Garafaglo or however you spell it.   On a sc-fi note: Whitley Strieber of www.unknowncountry.com has one of the most facinating radio programs besides www.coasttocoastam.com with Art Bell and George Noory! Topics include but never limited to: secret government stuff, UFO's, aliens, technology, astronomy, robots (A.I.) etc...etc. Great stuff!!!

        I can't wait. The sooner I get all my general requirements out of the way the better. I mean the sooner I win the lottery the better. Timberwolves stuck it to the Lakers last night while I was at work...barely! Come on guys, defeat the Lakers!    I need to take more English courses and hopefully by winter I will be on the college newspaper. Then they will see what it looks like when an adult writes, not a bunch of kids writing about happy meals and other waste of time subjects.   Keep Hope Alive....For me winning the lottery!

      I just realized I have no CGI support from my server because I am el-cheapo. Oh well, so far blogspot has been good to me but I would like to integrate it into my web site so people wouldn't have to leave my site. Wait a minute.....people? What people? Nobody looks at my site except me!!!

      Seems that I need more money than I have to have fun. I want to build a really powerful pc, so I can build really cool interactive web site. Yeah this is going to happen as soon as Judy Garland' clone fly's out my butt.   Why is it that people always want to give you advice, even thought you never ever ask them for it? If I say it's hot out today, that's not an invitation for you to suggest a million different ways to get cooler! Leave me alone... I miss my studio apartment in Oceanside,CA. That was the best place ever. No one there to bother me, I could read all day or draw or play games without a care to whom I was or wasn't talking or paying attention to.   Lottery............don't fail me now!

      Star Trek Deep Space Nine is on, it is the 2nd part of a season finale. Also, I can't believe the Lakers beat the Timberwolves. Someone has got to stop the Lakers!!!!! We need to hire Tonya Harding to do a whack job on some of the Lakers knee's to slow them down. This web stuff is so addicting. The more I learn, the more I want to do...except unix crap.

      I know this guy, let's just call him David. He talks about all the busy work he has to do and how much time he spends on it. In reality, this person (again let's just call him David) really loves to do this self busy work so he can have something to talk about. It's ok, he is still a nice guy.

      Well, I finished my english paper just about 15 min ago. It was 6 pages long. My math is done and all I have left is to read a story.....which I will do in the morning before class!    Just a weird observation. There are too many flakey people around today. Oh sure they will tell you all sorts of things but when its time to put up or shut, they shut up! I try to stand by my words no matter how hard it may be sometimes. When I tell someone I give them my word, thats like putting it in a vault and throwing away the key. Thats just the way I am. I dont know where I get it from, can't be my family, well maybe my uncle. Without your word, people will not trust you and then nobody will like you. Enough on that!   I really enjoy my new pc. I was watching a dvd, burning a cd, chatting online, using microsoft word, and surfing the internet with 4 tabs open on my Mozilla Firefox. The only thing I did notice was that buring a cd was the most comsuming (memory wise) but it wasnt too bad. Hats off to the dude who sold it to me and kudos to Paul for working his magic with the i386 file (wink wink)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   There is a guy I know, who at one time knocked a guy out because he said he was going to kick my ass. The guy was huge, it was in the military, he had an attitude and thought he could intimidate me with his size. He didn't because pain is temporary and I do not scare easily. I knew he wouldn't kill me so whats the worst he could do or stomach? Anyways, my friend Cosmo heard about it from another guy and walked down to this guys room, asked his roomates where he was, and then soon as he found him he clocked he so hard he went down like a ton of bricks. Cosmo is big, really big. Because I was such a good friend to him, he wanted to make sure nothing happedn to me. I didn't even ask him to do it, or require him to do it. I am sure I could have hurt this guy but that is the mark of a true friend.

      School went by quickly, I have a paper to write today but I will do that when I go home today. I am at work now so it would be hard to actually write my paper, but I am thinking of ideas for the paper. This is really addicting, this blog stuff. Its good practice for when I write a book or publish poems or an essay.   Well back to "work". :-)

       I wonder if I can make a million dollars before I am 30. I think I would like to try. Then you would see all sorts of "friends" come out of the wood works. That would be very interesting.    I would also like to have a book publish, kinda like a journal but with more of an outline or theme/direction to it. I think it would sell, I have tons of crazy things happen to me in the military, all over the world, and in my personal life.

      Wow, since I have the new PC and have been tweaking it here and there, lots of homework, and actual work, I was pretty tired the last 2 days. I tell you what, I am not working on Sunday's anymore! I will make up that time lost during the week a few hours a day so its less stress on me. I need time off and this will give me the breather I need every week.   My mind wanders a lot lately, if anyone wanted to know. I dream, plan, think, and then start the process all over again. I am trying to picture my self 5 years from now and what I will be doing. I really don't know except that it will involve computers/internet and writing. I want to build that web idea of mine, I need support though. I think I will talk with my uncle and run my ideas by him. He is really smart and I could take constructive criticism from him. He wouldn't b.s. me either, if it sucks it sucks. You know what I mean? I would love to do some sort of web job permanently and if it paid well enough, that would be my main source of cash'ola.  I have been doing pretty good at becoming more of a robot. I really have. It was hard at first, but now it is easier and easier. Remove feelings and emotions from the day to day life and its much better. Of course I still laugh and care about my friends etc...etc.... but the invisible forces do not tell me when to move anymore.   I need to finish some homework but I want to take a shower.

        I am watching the Discovery Channel at work and they are having another biker build off contest. It is soooo main stream and yuppized now, I can't believe it. If I hear another cheesy announcer say that is "old school" or that's the way it used to be done, I am going to lose my mind. Every single bike show and builder uses the same techniques it seems like. They all know how to use metal/gold/silver flakes in their paint, and they all bend steel and aluminum so I what's the catch? They are all the same!!! The designs are different yes, but they all use the same techniques I swear!!!! So high class and yuppized. You know what's real and old school? Some poor bloke that is fixed his piece of crap Honda or whatever in his garage himself or trying to paint it himself!!! That's old school!   In other new, I am going to see my friend at her work to get some of my DVD's back that I want to watch. I don't think it will go well. I bet my left eye that soon as I walk in there, she will hand me the DVD's and walk away. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. Well, I could go to Taco Bell afterwards. Yeah, that sounds like a plan. A stupid plan but its my plan!

      Well,     I have written some pretty weird stuff while sitting in here left alone to m own thoughts. I almost seem like in a trance when I write down things that mean something to me. I feel weird. Like it took a lot of energy or something. I will post them on my poetry section soon. I wish I could write a happy poem or story. I guess I will when the words come to me. I shouldn't try to force happiness. That only gets you deeper in the pain department if you want to know my opinion.    I have a craving for some pasta right now but I can't do jack about it. I am the only one here so I can't leave to get anything. So I have been eating Starburst candies that I found in my backpack. Yum yum.

      It is so slow today. I hate it when there is no one here. I have actually acomplished alot with computer maintenance but now I am bored. I kinda made an outline/list of what my next paper should be about. It is not due for awhile so I dont really feel like doing that now. I almost want to shut the room down but I need the money.    More exciting news to come! :-(

      Man, I need that time machine! I was just thinking about all the things I have to do vs. all the things I want to do vs. all things I told people I would do for them. Jeesh!!!    Let's see :  I have to do homework, pay my bills, etc             I want to : build my pc, make a new web site for myself. Draw, write, surf the net.             I told people: make them web sites, help them build computers.   I want to start building web sites for a couple of people, whenever they get around to actually purchasing a web host. With out that, I will not start on a site. Computer repair/building is an always ongoing topic with anyone I know. My web site.....is just a dream for now. So this is why I need my time machine, it doesn't have to be a DeLorean, I could use my truck. That would be ok.

      I slept ok last night. The neighbors idiot dog didn't keep barking all night like it did on Saturday!    So I am at work now. I did some maintenance on all the computers, restarted the fileserver (it was responding way too slow) and restated the primary server. Everything is running smooth now. The fileserver is back to its old self again too.    I still have a paper to write, but I am not in the mood right now. There is nobody in here!! 2 people at the most have come in. I wish Paul would come in!!!! I really want to show him the K-Meleon Kiosk browser that I configured yesterday. He probably had tons of super genius homework to do.    I think I will surf Craigslist for awhile. I can't wait until Monday afternoon so I can start my art project (which is due Tuesday) and build my new computer!!!!! Muah ahahahahahah.

        Paul was trying to make a kiosk that was totally secure and wouldn't allow anyone to surf the web and go to bad web sites or input any web sites. He was going to almost create a new program or edit an existing web browser to do this. Since he was so nice to help me fix my computer yesterday, I went to work on the Kiosk browser problem after I did my homework today. I downloaded the browser K-Meleon (freeware) which uses the same engine as Mozilla Firefox (freeware also), and proceeded to read all there was to read on configuring and customizing K-Meleon. After a couple of hours, and some frustrating trial and error, I got it. Now when Paul comes in tomorrow, I can show him how I did it and how it works so we can setup the final product on the real computer that will be eventually located in Portland somewhere on the street so homeless people can point and click on the web sites we give the access to (government stuff, info on jobs/shelters, stuff like that) and they wont need to type anything because we will remove the keyboard. It will be smooth as butter. Best of all, its free.    In other news, I will have to draw my art project on Monday because I just cant draw here...period. I think I will setup a collage of interesting items in my room, then sit in my chair for a dew hours listening to Pink Floyd while I draw. I will use the techniques the teacher wants us teach  so it will be a little different than I am used to, but hey that's the point of me taking this class in the first place. If I just drew everything the same way as I do now, then I can't expand as an artist.   1 hour until closing time! Yippie. I talked with Barbara today. I met her sister Kelley. She seems nice and I look forward to hanging out at Barbara's and meeting her. No one really here today in the computer room. Quite...too quite.    My thoughts wander over to my room and my new PC sitting there waiting for me to put some new hardware in her. Her name is Seatec Astronomy. She is great. I envision us having a great human computer experience for a few years to come. Eventually, and money permitting, I will drop in 2 GB of mind warping RAM. Speed and power that will be unrivaled by anyone for awhile, at least anyone I know.     I was researching my web idea some more and found a similar (just one aspect) site and web author. I think I am on the right track if just one aspect of my idea is working for someone and they are making money, not a lot, but its a start. I think I will eventually ask some people if they want to become partners with me to start up my idea.

      So I finished 3 assignment so far for English 101. I still have one more paper to write and some biographies to read and summarize but I think I will take a break for now. I have my art project to do but the wackos in here wont stop bugging me! I can't draw when I am aggravated. Its different when you typing, you can stop and then come back to it and it looks the same. If I try to draw, I will probably mess up and that would make me mad!   The nose is feeling good today.   I was thinking more about making a new website but I would like to research the idea I have more before I put any of my money into it. I think it would work. Other web sites have similar services/info, but not they way I want to display it and have people respond to it if they want to. The web page would take a lot of planning, then a lot of time to maintain, but really think it could work. At least I know for sure it had a good possibly of becoming popular.  The computer room is empty now. I am bored. My only friends are the sound of 20 computers humming along with no one to operate them. Sad.....yes.....true...yep.

       I was passing the Columbia Tech Center Waterfall Fountain on the corner of Millplain and 164th and I started to miss the suds! These kids used to always fill that waterfall/pool area with soap late at night or early in the morning and that always made me laugh as I drove by. I haven't seen the suds in a few months now and I am getting worried that those kids haven't been keeping up of the town moral with their suds duties! One time, I think it was Halloween, they put red dye and soap in the waterfall. There were these huge red foam bubbles everywhere! It was great. My hats off to those guys!!!!

      When I am dealing with people I don't want to talk to, I should just agree with them so the conversation will end. Especially with people who you know wont even listen to what you have to say! I need to just think in my head more and not outside my head outloud. More contemplation, less aggravation is my new motto.  Work was great. Paul and Barbara helped me figure out that my hard drive on my new PC was shit and I got a semi-new one from Matt. He kinda owed me anyways for his dog eating my face!   I have a art project and a few English papers I must get done this weekend.....Preferably!!!!   Ice in my vains, chills up my spine, I am in a mood again.

      Wow, this is going fast. Only 7 more weeks then I am done with another quarter of college. I can't wait to get it over with. I am enjoying my art class htough. The teacher is very nice and laid back. Today we drew for 2 hours, different styles and techiniques, and listened to music. If only all my class were so relaxing. I felt almost sad to leave class, except for the fact my face still hurts!   I bought a new (used) pc today. It is very powerfull. When I get it all configured and up and running, it will smash this thing I am on now. The pc I am on now is really fast and can do lots of things. I want more though. I want to really try to get into more graphics design and more hardcore web design. Of course while those apps are open, I will be streaming audio from multiple sites, have a couple IM windows opne for chatting, surfing the web for more ideas and art examples, and whatever graphics editor I choose to use. Its a P4 with 512MB RAM...I plan on upgrading that to 2 GB of RAM!!!!!! Muah ha hahaha ha.  Other than that, I wonder about things alot now. I seem to do that when I am alone. I was walking on campus today to go to get a bagel formt he cafeteria and I just stopped and looked around at all the people, all 20 of them during the summer, walking to and from their classes. I wonder what classes they are taking, what are they doing in life? Then I continue on to the cafeteria and then the bakery lady, out of nowhere, starts talking to me all seriuos about her daughter and her son's school work and all sorts of stuff. I guess she needed someone to talk to so I listened for almost 10 minutes and then her boss or teacher or bakery manager wanted her to do something but she thanked me for my time and then gave me my bagel.

        I was talking to a friend who lives in Seattle, he said to look online for a date because that's how he met his wife! I told him that I am not into that kinda thing so I will just wait for "something to come my way" I guess. It was good to hear from him after not seeing him for a couple years now.     I got a letter from the Navy Reserve telling me I had to update my contact information in case they want to recall me to active duty. I would sooner put a gun to my head than go back into the service. The first 2 years were great...the last 3 years were a living hell with no sense of reality or common sense. I think I would either tell them to piss off or go live in Canada. Actually, I should just tell them I have a heavy drug problem or something. I should anyways right?????    I was thinking about that whole dog bite my nose off thing. I was pissed that crap keeps happening to me but then I was thinking, at least that stupid dog didn't take my eye! It was so close to my eye; I don't think I could live happily with one eye. The eye patch would be kinda cool though.

What the hell, I am used to crap so I shouldn't be too pissed over the whole life sucks situation. I don't feel like doing anything now, not even homework but I have to! So I am going to try and listen to my headphones and chill while I do some homework.    Life:1,232,343  Rob: 2  So far life is kicking my ass!!!!

      You know what hurts the most? Its the fact that I had to miss work. Well the nose hurts the most but that other thing hurts the second most. I enjoy going to work during the week. Now I have to do my homework but I have to try to get myself in the mood. I just want to lay here and sleep. I am watching Il Padrino II (thats The Godfather II for you non-Italiano's) :-)  I love the Godfather! That and Goodfellas are 2 great movies.     urlLink Pics Of My Still Messed Up Face!!!!

      I was at my friend Matt's house to pick up some computers with him while we were at work and his dog, which was very nice to me in the beginning, bit me hard as hell in the face/nose. Man, I feel like some one punched me hard....then bit me. Npow I know how Evander Holyfield felt when Tyson bit his ear!   I am not mad at Matt or the dog, things just happen I guess. Lately, it seems they happen to me!!!!!   urlLink Pics Of My Messed Up Face!!!!

      After the comedy club last night, I feel relax in the brain. I needed a good couple of hours of straight laugther. Now I am off to go to school and read an essay that I should have read yesterday before class.   Also, the latte lady has a new girl working there. She is becomeing more and more like latte lady sr., what a weirdo.

      Today was a good day at school. I know now that I am left to my own thoughts. I think I said 5 words all day at school and you know what, I didn't even care. Good more time to write and think. I met a guy I worked with like 7 years ago before I joined the Navy in my art class today. I am happy to see that he has a family and is doing somewhat well. I think I will enjoy this art class this summer. I went to the Clark bookstore and picked up a bunch of supplies. I really want to do weird art projects but I think this is a more structured class.  So anyways, I am slowly returning back to where I belong. It is more of a mental challenge to repress the urge to say hi to people or talk to people or go out of my way to be nice, but in the end, it will pay off. The machine state of Rob will be fully functional...Hopefully soon. Robotic in nature, robotic in emotions.

      The day went as planned. I got to my classes just fine and I think I will like my english class. Math I could care less about and Art is cool. So anyways, I don't think I am wanted anymore...in any type of shape or form. I don't know what I did or didn't do but I can't control or understand what I have no clue about. I just need to get back to me, I am the only person who cares about me so I think I should actively look out for myself more often. It's really weird how life just points its finger at you on some special day and flips your world upside down or maybe completely squashes it. Well, I will fight back and will not go down easily. Invisible forces will no longer control me.   Oh, also there is another cool motorcycle special on the Discovery Channel tonight. I think I will watch it after I spend sometime with my old friend "The Catcher In The Rye".

      Mmmmm, I had garlic bread and lasagna. I got an e-mail from my friend Dave or as the state of California refers to him as, "pyscho". Damn it's hot as hell in my room but "f" it; I am not turning my computer off!   There is a cool motorcycle special on Discovery Channel. I don't ride or want o, but I like to watch people build things. It's like me building a story or peom but they do it with metal.   Wish me luck in school tomorrow!

      There is a frozen meal in the freezer with my name in it baby! I can't get a hold of Marcus....I have some ideas for his web page. He is not answering his pager. He probably doesn't even know its off or broken. I think I will stop by the store on my way home tonight and buy some lottery tickets. I close down the computer room at 8:00pm but it's not soon enough. So boring today, I think I will put on my headphones to melt away the silence.

      I think I will take the credit for this one. I came in a little early to work to install updates on the server and then I restarted it to let the updates take effect. Pow...zoom...I can't remember the connection here being so fast. Also since Matt isn't here today, his laptop is sucking the bandwidth out of the network while he downloads the lastest Aqua Teen Hunger Force episodes.....not that I don't like to watch them when he's here!   School starts tomorrow. I am glad I checked my schedule....and then rechecked it again. It looks pretty sweet for me. I will be out at 9:30am 2 days a week and at noon the other 2 days leaving me with Friday off. I still have to come to "work" but hey I will live!  Thinking about book writing and web building. I just wish I had the time to read and learn all the stuff that I want to learn about instead of what a school say I should learn! I think I am better at self teaching...at least about the subjects I care about. Math is a subject I don't care about.

      I think shortly I will create and buy a new web site/address. I want to keep the slot car one, maybe even show my friend how to update it, so he can do that and I can focus on more creative things that interest me at the moment. I was thinking of a new web name for my site....like www.independentideas.com or creativeideas.com or creativethoughts.com or something like that. So it would be a web site about me and things that I do like write, build web stuff, a little drawing maybe. I want it to have my own built in blog and a message board for people to post ideas, opinions, and comments about anything they want on my site. This is still just at thought so far, we shall see where it goes.

      I was driving to work today, like I do every weekend, and I got to thinking. I was beautiful. I used to be a machine. Nothing could touch me. Nothing. Things would bounce off of my skin like it was nothing, and back then it was nothing to me. I didn't care about anyone or anything too much that it affected me or what I was doing. I cared about stuff, just that stuff didn't take over my thoughts or life. I remember those times and I think, "what the hell happened to me"? I need to get back to that old Rob. The more focused person, the machine I used to be. I will rebuild and overcome. I will topple over anything that stands in my way.

      I left work a little early today to go pick up some backyard furniture that my mom found at some garage sale for free. So I get there and there I see one of the biggest piece of shit plastic table I have ever seen. It looked like the sun ate thru it and changed it into 3 different shades of puke green. It was so dirty and had bugs all over it. How fun it was to pick it up and haul it over to my house. Just a little paint she says...yeah right. I will probably be taking that thing to the dunp next week!   It was fun seeing my Aunt & Uncle again. I used to see them all the time but since school and work, I dont get to do that many things. My Uncle says he is really proud of me and all but it sucks never to be able to plan for a nice longweekend or something.   I just think that I deserve more. Hopefully, when school starts, I will breeze thru these classes and have fun. I cant wait to take some journalism classes and show these punk ass kids what a real story should look like, instead of sloppy joe updates and whats the schools favorite color.

      Talked with my friend Pete and Stephanie. They are great. They made me feel great and broght my spirits up a little. So did Barbara and Paul the other day. I am pleased. I just got finished with 2 more poems. I wasnt even trying to write, I just sat down, put on my Spiderworks CD in the server room, yes I used the Developer Machine! I am somehow angry today. I dont know if this is just part of the whole "I dont feel loved thing" i a have been going thru but I will smash it down soon. It wont bother me anymore. Damn its hot in this server room!

I want to see that movie Super Size Me....it looks funny as hell!!!!!!!!!    Well, goodbye Shaq and Phil.....maybe on some other team you guys can win another championship.   Maybe this period of my life is for the best??? Thats what she says but I have a hard time believing it. One day, the big guy upstairs will let it be known to me why I was made to suffer.

      Last night I hung out with a cool dude form college. We have a lot in common and are going to hook each other up with cool things.   My friend, she seems confused. I hope she can sift thru her confusion and realize that I will be her friend no matter where she moves to. Thats what friends are all about. I enjoy our friendship and want it to continue on as a friendship. Hopefully, she wants to be my friend too and not just push me away because she might move.

      Now here comes my old friend pain. How I have missed you. No love connection here with my friend but we are still friends and we can talk about our feelings no matter what they are which is really great.   My heart turned to ice............so cold and motionless. I still will care and think about her, wish her well in anything she does or in any relationship she has. I just have to hope, just hope that one day my dreams and her dreams will cross and on that day, she will find feelings of love for me. Until then, I will be the best friend and man I know how to be.    I wrote some poems....... just go back to my web site. www.soylentracing.com Its under the stories/poem link...or under the "whats on my mind" part of the menu at the top.  The newer ones towards the bottom reflect my current feelings. Read'em, make fn of them, laugfh at them, I dont care. Someone is trying to stomp out my love of life, I can't let them win! I will go on.  Oh and also.......HURRAY FOR THE PISTONS!!!! Sorry Kobe.....dont drop the soap!

      Wow, my friend is sooo cool. When I look into her eyes, I just become a zombie, so focused on her and what she's doing. I think she feels the same way about me too. I am not looking for a filler relationship. I want to look for the long term. She is so great and I could see her in my future and hopefully she can see me in hers. We went to the V-Mall and walked around and then we sat at the food court and just talked about all the things we were feeling, what we liked in a relationship and what we didn't like in a relationship. I think she might have been holding back a little, but that's probably wrong. I was so happy that she was even talking about having a relationship with me and I cant wait to see her. She is my number 1 thought. Runners up in my thought category are: Steve Nash, Microsoft, Catcher In The Rye, Love, Friendships, My Dog, Washing my truck, building web sites, writing some sort of book, drawing, sore legs and feet, Bob Ross, and many many others.

      Well the trip ended a little early but thats ok. We covered alot of ground in a short time so thats good. Lots of cool scenery. Could have done without the crappy boots that never stayed dry but oh well, lifes a bitch.   So the blog gods were listening kinda. When I got back from the trip, my friend called me so we went to hangout (I was tired as hell but took some motrin and drank some coffee to spend time with her). I think she likes me but is undedcided if she wants to pursue anything with me due to the fact that she is moving to California in a month. She said that we will see what happens if she moves or not. I hope she doesnt but I do not want her to stay with me out of pitty or guilt. I want her to feel happy with her choices so if that means watching her go away to California, then I will have to let her go. It will be very sad but I want her to be happy.   Today, my friend and I are going to hangout in my truck and watch movies on her laptop, and no nothing is going to happen!!!!! Jerks! I will tell her watch I just told you random people of the internet.

      Wow, I am ready for my trip...I think. The one thing though, is I am nervous about a certain friend I have. I really enjoy our friendship but I can't deny that I have feelings for this person. I want to find the perfect time to tell this person but the ting is, this person will be moving soon. Man it hurts, I dont want to go through life wondering what if?????? I did that once before and it sucked. If the feelings are not mutual, I will still be happy to be just friends. Tonight is the night I hope I can find a moment alone to tell my feelings.    Hello???? Blog gods???? Help me out with this one!!!!

On top of that, I am hungry and I wont to leave work now but I can't until after 5 o'clock when the next computer room worker shows up. Arrrrrgghh!  Lakers vs Pistons tonight!!!!!!!!! Go Detroit!!!!!!!!!  So I think I will just forget about the extra credit. I don't think I need it anyways. After I eat something later, I might feel up to it.

It should be tons of fun. We will be gone from Friday until the following Wed/Thursday. I will be preparing for the trek. I will also keep a journal of the daily events. Then I will put them on this blog and my web site. This trip will be a cross between Deliverance and the movie Alive.

      Man, on the way to bingo, some big dude on this stupid moped was swurving all around trying to be "cool" in front of us on a side street when he lost control and flipped off his moped. He was going like 20mph! He tumbled and hit his head on the street. Blood was steadily pouring from his head and he was banged up pretty good. We stopped and some lady put a t-shirt around his head. I tried to get the guy to stop moving and quit trying to stand up but he wanted to move. So he kinda crouched there while my friend called 911 from my cell phone. This guys wife and kid pulled up on their moped and went crazy. The kid was balling and the wife was nuts. There was a nice pool of blood on the street next to where his head was. The ambulance came and took him away.It reminded me of my medic days. I think his shoulder or arm had a fracture in it somewhere and he had some head trauma. The was a nice big lump and swelling on the side of his head. When I first saw his head when he was on the ground, I thought that part of it was gone for a second or there was a hole in it. X-rays will tell the story and possibley a MRI for his head. ONe thing is for sure, he will never mess around like that again on a moped without a helmut!  I didn't win crap at the bingo place and it was filled with old hags. I need to do homework and a research paper I have been neglecting, but I will wait until tomorrow I think.

      As much as I hate math and school in general, I am acing all of my classes so far. You mighy say I probably just ruined it by saying that but I don't think so. Work went ok. School was ok too. I think this older lady, in her late 30's or early 40's, likes me. She sits near me in one of my classes and she always stares at me and is looking at me. When I return her look, she looks away real quick. Maybe I have a booger or something every morning and she doesn't have the heart to tell me.   I must stay foceussed on school and work. That is my priority. I can not detour from that!

What happend to those great songs about wives leaving their husbands, lost jobs, and trucks breakiung down?????? It's all about the money. Chicks love that beach bum cowboy shit.  I finished my art project, a self-portrait. It's pretty good. It could have been better but I didn't feel like spending all day on it.

I was so happy. I laughed my ass off!   So it's 1:24pm and I haven't eaten anything today. I want to get a sub sandwich and then I guess I will come back home and watch a movie (Sopranos probably), then goof around online or something. The weather is alot cooler today so I feel pretty relaxed. I still have the song World Destruction stuck in my head. Oh well, at least it keeps me company.

I would love to live alone and invent things and write about things. That can't be all there is to my life is it? I think so. If I strive for other things, friends, relationships, anything, I just fall flat. Arrrghhhh. I guess patience is what is needed but the longer you wait and have no idea what will come, the more impatient you get with life. It's a vicious circle.

      I can't wait for the air conditioner to be fixed!! Its hot in this computer room. Lots of machines are on and lots of people too. Thank God that there is one air conditioner near the "customer" computer area so that I do not have to smell B.O. if it gets too hot. In my area, I have only fans! It sucks.  I have the urge to beat the living shit out of my neighbor. His stupid f*ing dog will not shut up and the housing manager says all we can do is complain to animal control. Eventually it will take up to a year or more to evict these scumbags according to the manager. All I want to do is file a complaint with this guys face with my fist. That will solve it. Then he would shut his dog up and shut his fat wife up too. But....I know I would go to jail and I would seem like a bad guy but this guy's stupid dog barks 24/7 and wakes me up almost every night and annoys everybody in the neighborhood during the day. I have a plan though...it takes me bak to my more devious days. Nuff' said.

I found out that it actually costs money to patent inventions. I will have to save some money to pay a patent lawyer to draw up the correct paperwork and let the lawyer submit them. If all goes according to my plan, nothing ever does, I could make a nice chunk of side change.

      So I left work about 5ish....get on the freeway and boom.......I am stuck in massive traffic. Some semi-truck fliped the hell over right on the on-ramp that I neede to take. It was to late to take another exit and the only other exit was AFTER you go over the I-5 bridge to Portland!!! So I was forced to drive to Portland, get on I-84E, then get on I-205N, then finally get back to Washington State!!!!!!!!!!!!! Damn that sucked. It ate up over 2 hours! It was rush hour bumper-to-bumper wherever I went. From now on, after work, I will just tak 4th Plain all the way to 164th to my house. No more chancing the freeway near 5 o'clock rush hour!!!

      I need to get this stupid art project over with! THe teacher says it should take 4 hours. Yeah right, 4 hours my ass. Maybe 2 hours for me. There is no way I am staring at my foot for more than 15 minutes....thats right one of the things I have to draw is my foot. That is a great mental pic huh??? &nbsp; On a weirdness note...I am slipping away....to where I am not sure yet.

      Well, the homework is pretty much destroyed!!!! I kicked its butt.  &nbsp; Now I am all alone to my thoughts again. Thats a bad thing because then I get all dopey and lonely.&nbsp; Its all quiet here and thats cool but I am just thinking about that person who wasn't my friend. I know I shouldn't even write about that here but who cares, its my website!!!!!!!!! I still feel saddend. Not as bad but still I wonder what the hell?? How could I let myself fall and fall hard? I think I am insane. We all are insane but I can see that I am insane and I am comfortable with that. I am not comfortable with society and what it thinks is normal though. &nbsp; 3 more hours to go until I can go home. 60 more years until I die or maybe sooner who knows? I was thinking about stopping by a bar before I go home and relax but then who am I kidding, I can't relax anywhere but my cave of a room. Thats my own little world there.

      I have typed up 5 (one page) biographies and am almost done with all my English homework for the quarter. I still need to do a frickin' huge art project but I can't do that here so it will have to wait until tomorrow. I am hungry now. My hands are tired of typing so I am taking a break from homework for awhile.  &nbsp; On a happiness note: I feel like I am going nowhere in life and working my ass off in school and going to work and all that stuff....for nothing. We shall see though.

      I am doing ok today...sorta. I seem to "just listen" a little more now when people are talking aboutthings they no nothing about or anything in general. I just make a note in my mid that they are wrong, especially when it comes to computers and stuff, and then I just say oh wow thanks for the information.   Now its time to write another 6 page essay. I was stmped about what to write but I had an inspiration right now so I will whip this assignment out in no time! Hopefully.

      We moved (about 60%) the computer room today. I think that the new room will provide the needed "space" between customer and technition that we all want. So I am tired of moving tables and cabinets and computers. I need to do a little english homework but that should go smooth. I will listen to Phil Hendrie while I do it. I love Phile Hendrie. Somethings in life that have been constant for me is my love of the Phil Hendrie Show. For over 7 years I listen and laugh at all the stupid people who call in and argue with his "guests".     To follow The Way, is to follow your destiny

      Wow it's hot today. I finished my art project like in 20 minutes. I was supposed to take 3 hours or so but screw that...I am hot. I drew a picture of my vacuum cleaner with a football helmut on top of the handle with a roll of toilet paper hanging out of it. This class is interesting but difficult because I am not a very strong or structured artist. I like random drawings, lines, and chaos on the paper. I guess you could call my style abstract. The teacher doesn't seem to into abstract so I better do well on my next project.  So I think I might watch another movie or something. Maybe I will watch Starship Troopers 2. Yeah, I think I will.

         I guess it's best not to even talk to someone who was never really your friend to begin with. In my mind I was a friend, however, in the other persons mind I wasn't much of anything. The best thing for me is to forget this whole thing, forget the past of this person, present, and the future of this person. I don't wish harm or anything bad; its just that why bother?   Good bye      It is like 90 degrees in my room. I am almost done with my english homework and I've finished my stupid math. I have to draw my art project today. I think I am going to wait until everyone leaves the house later on to start on it. I think I am going to draw my hot water heater in my garage with some tools on it. It has a good shape and nice easy lines so I should finsh that quickly....I hope.

      Homework is done...as done as I want it to be. Now I want to relax and watch some good old mafia style killings!! I love Tony Soprano. He cracks me up. When he said in one episode after his son vandalized the school swimming pool, "How do you vandalize a swimming pool?"  I just died laughing when he said that.

      Well enough loafing around, its homework time. I ate a 12" sub for lunch so that made me extra tired so I watched tv for like 2 hours and vegetated. Now I must get my work done. I like to listen to my headphones and get into the right mindset for homework. After thats done, I want to watch a movie or smoke some crack. Well, maybe just the movie...lol.

      15 more minutes until work is done. I found a new search engine I have never heard of before. It is called   urlLink Giga Blast  . It so fast I cant believe it. I think it is faster than Google and possible a better search engine. Try it, at least you will find it interesting.

      Work is almost over. I have been courtious to all but very short with my answers. That way, people dont bug me as much. Before, I used to actually talk with people here but then they didnt know when to stop talking and stay out of your own conversations with someone else.    Wowsa wowsa. I got that song in my head that makes me laugh by the Rolling Stones,  urlLink She's So Cold!   It reminds me of my situation. :-)  It's funny, life that is. But its funny in that cruel ironic way.

      Damn it. I got to get my head back. This totally sucks. I just want to go home and lay down. Crap. I want to do something. I got to just get my head back. I need something to occupy that space. I hate this. I hate this. I hate this. I need a vaction from my mind. Hmmm, maybe I should just start a new split personality.   On a hydration note, I have drank 1 XL coffee, half of my bottled water, and half of my Poweraide jug. I have been taking a leak almost every 10 min it seems! I know, TMI right?

      I don't understand thigns. People give pieces of themselves away and the people take pieces away from you. The thing is, I just don't get it. Why do things turn out the way they do? Damn. I don't want to be here right now. This is not a good place to just "be by yourself" or "gather your thoughts". I am so confused and hurt.  Its not anybodys fault but my own . I should just shut up and drift away.

I will have better things to say later but for now I cant type too well because  I am just too f***ing sad .

      Well I got nothing to do so I rented some movies but now I dont feel like watching them. I was just thinking about Super Troopers. I love Farva. The part when he is about to eat that hamburger and looks at it and says, "does this look like spit to you....awww fuck it". LOL   I think I will just watch some reruns of The Sopranos dvd's. They make me happy. I love the violent humor of the Italian mafia. Of course there are the 1,000 web/computer projects I got going on now. I do those tomorrow at work.   What goes up....must eventually come down and vice versa.

This is my normal schedule so its not like I am cutting out early or something. I might go and hang out with a friend later on but I don't know for sure.

Is he typing e-mail? Chatting? Playing a game????? It none of anybodys business as long as I do my job....and I do!   I am even staying late tonight until 7:00pm instead of 5:00pm because I am that nice. I don't have to, I am not that desparate for hours, but I will try to be nice.

Also, some other people need to get off their ass and help those who need help!   Arrgghhhh...............I must keep my mouth shut and let all this crap blow over. I do not get paid enough to be stressed out!

      I was kinda tired when I woke up this morning. I stopped at the Brewed Awakenings and got a xtra large mocha to start my school day off. I had 2 test and I think I did ok on them both...hopefully. Work was weird. Some guy was talking about legalizing pot and of course that got everyone talking becasue most of the people are recovering addicts. Man I was pissed that this guy brought up this subjuect in front of these guys, so I left the room and went to the server room for a bit. I worked on the VA kiosk project for a few hours, then did some internet research for some English homework. I finally got paid today from the GI Bill. Danm they take forever and I even have direct deposit!  I just finished posting new poems on my website. About 4 or 5 of them towards the bottom with blue arrows next to them. Sometimes when I get down and feel blue, I just start to write exactley how I feel. Well sometimes not ewxactley because then I would ahve to say I am tired of life and can't wait for something better. I am listening to Phil Hendrie right now and at least I am happy when I listen to him. He cracks me up. Also what is really funny is all the stupid people in the world tha tcall up his show and debate his "guests".     urlLink Here is my poetry page

      So the homework is done. I looked over my books a little for a couple of test tomorrow. I am listening to some tunes right now. Just trying to mellow out. I have lots of new poetry but I don't want to rush putting them on my website so they will wait until tomorrow. I think I can work it in my schedule if I am not too busy at my work. Now I am just surfing the web, thinking about nice things. I want to get rid of this monkey on my damn back. My idea was to just "get away" but that will never work. Where would I go? There are people everywhere. I need to make a new front. The neutral front that I show to the everyday common folk. That way, I will blend into the background of everyday life. That is exactly where I want to be, just observing. That is also what Lao Tzu teaches in the Taoteching. Smart, very smart.

      Wow! Everybody at work today was on pins and needles including myself. We are all working hard at trying to keep the computers from falling apart and making them easier for the guys to use. A small group of people like to abuse our generousity and our skills as computer helpers and as nice people in general. It makes it hard to want to help anyone but for myself, I just need to step back and regroup.   I have homework to do. I should always put that first instead of anything extra they want me to do at work. They don't care how well I do in school anyways! I care so its me first and then they get what I give them.

      Well school is over for today. I was pretty tired because I was out late last night up at Martin's studio. It was cool and a beautifull view from his studio. I had fun fixing his computer and helping with the website.   I have been writing more lately. I need to take some time tonight and put them on my web page. They are hopeless thoughts from a dopey guy.   I have to get back to work now.

I want to do my homework now and the family wants me to tear apart some tent shade thing that they used for the 4th. So I do that, but then they have to chime in on how its being done. I wanted to just get it over with but simple things take forever in my family. Thats why I am different from them. I tackle things and solve or destroy them very quickly so I can move on to something else more important.   Now I begin my homework.

      I ate way too much today. I will not have to eat food for at least 3 days now. Well I am kinda in a weird place right now. I would rather talk to myself than anybody else. I wonder what the world would be like, at least the lives of all that are around me now, would be like if I went away or was never born. It would be kinda like Its A Wonderful Life. So far, I see no real purpose for my existence, except that I am curious as hell about tons of things and I love knowledge and creativity. It must be all the cake I ate today getting me all loopy!!! I will post some poems on Monday after I do a little homey work gee funk.

      Holy crap on a stick. Whenever I get a stupid idea, I need to hit myself in the foot with a hammer...nuff' said. Its about 7:12pm and work is crawling on by. Well, at least 90% of my homework is done. I need to re-write my hug paper in English class and do a few math sections in the book oh and also start another art project...but that can wait until later Sunday and early Monday. I will go visit Martin at his music studio Monday night and check it out and check out his computer! Maybe I can get a quick guitar lesson while I am there. Shoot, who can even start another hobby when school eates up 80% of my time and work eats up like 15% and the rest of the "free" time is traveling in between the two places!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I just realized today that I am my own best friend.   I trust myself and look forward to being alone alot so then I must be....right????? Oh well, who cares. I have nothing to look forward to except a nice funeral and possibly becoming a ghost. I would love to come back and haunt people and mess with people that I didn't like when I was alive.Hey, that sounds like a good book or movie plot. I got dibs on it.  On a smelly note. The area is now at a musty 6 out of 10 stink points.

      Duh, I finally figured out what RSS stands for; Really Simple Syndication. I can't believe I didn't know that! It has to conform to XML 1.0 standards. You know what that means right?? I have to learn RSS and now XML!!! Arrggghhhhh!!!!!    I wish I had some sort of matter de-materializer combobulator thingy. That would make the day go by smoother. I would jsut zap the idiots that are just plain weird.    Where is the truth in the world? I am wondering what the heck am I breaking my back for? The lottery seems like such a sweet dream right now. Things would be different. I would live alone in a house. Well it would look like a house but it would be more like a fortress! State-of-the-art everything! Lets just say the house would talk to me. I know how to do that too. It would take a few really good computers and some custom software. I would be like,"house, what is on TV or order me a pizza online". It seems stupid or not possible, but it is and I will do that my house if I win the lottery!!!!

       It all over baby. Oh well friends come and go. I am forever, the more I stray from this idea, the more bad crap happens to me. So from now on, it me and the advancement of me. Its a cruel world but as the old saying goes...how is it again??? Oh yeah its "fuck it".    I installed a cd-rom drive into this computer I am on at work. For some stupid reason, the dvd-r drive didnt want to play any audio files of any type. It read data just fine though. I didn't bring a movie to test that but I have seen other people watch movies on this thing before so I am sure it works. Now at least I've got my tunes to keep me company in the luney bin. Man, soon as I put them on, everyone wants to borrow them because there is only 1 set in this room for everyone to share. Thats not my problem so nobody gets my headphones! They cost me $30!      Murphy...your my hero

      I was at a friends place and we watched Happy Texas. Let me give you some advice, happy means gay and thats what this movie is!!! Overall, it was funny because most of us were cracking jokes about how gay the movie was. I had a great time.    I have to remember to go to work early tomorrow. This nice guy I know there has an interview online at 9:00am sharp but the room opens at 9 so I told him I would get there early so he can login in time to setup for htis interview. I am too nice I know after I even said that I wasn't going to help anyone anymore! Damn, my achilles heal, kindness. Its that urge I have to help people. Sometimes it hurts me to help others. I get taken advantage of so I must be carefull. This guy seems pretty stand up.   Say no to Happy Texas!!!

      That's it. No more small talk in the computer room for me. No more answering peoples questions at all that does not relate to computers. Especially no opinion questions. No more info about me or what I like or what I am doing. People in here just get too damn nosey!!!!! Today totally sucked. I didn't get anything done. I reseached some stuff but thats about it. I know Saturday will be a long day in this room for me. I think I am going to bring my headphones, maybe even a movie. I wont give people a chance to bother me. No common sense. Just mind you own business and everything else will fall in line.

      Holy crap! I am so pissed right now. This guy at work was bitching and moaning at me, about how the work studys' don't do there job and thats why the big boss made new rules in the room. I am so tired of people bitching at me for the rules. If everyone used the computers for job searches and to play simple games, we would all be fine. Thats not the case though. You have idiots who spend all their time in chat rooms trying to pick up on "women", people trying burn cd's in a government room, people who are curious and try to alter or edit things on the computers and the list goes on and on. Thats why the rules keep getting more ridiculous and stricter. Get mad at the other people that use the room and that mess it up for you  not get mad at the people who keep the room open and make sure the computers work and help you type and surf the web!!!!!! I don't make the rules of this room. I am paid to keep the doors open, help vets with pc problems and thats it. Anything else I do is extra and out of the kindness of my heart. I don't think I will "go the extra mile" for these people. Robotic, I must be robotic!!!!! Arrrghh this world is sooooo frustrating.

If you want to say you like the color blue, don't go into a philibister about the history of the color pallette or why you hate all the other colors, just say you like the color blue. Jeesh!!!  Checkout   urlLink KFI AM640 online . You can listen to any of their radio shows live via their cool streaming program. I recommend catching  urlLink The Phil Hendrie Show  from 7:00pm til 10:00pm.

      I am at work, researching how to automatically make Internet Explorer restart to its homepage after 10 min of inactivity. Its boring stuff I know, but someone has to do it.   Oh yeah, whats the deal with all those road counter things you drive over???? They are on Highway 14 from I-5 all the way to the 164th exit. Is Big Brother trying to get info from us???? There were a lot of highway pigs on the road too.   Remember, the government is always trying to get information from its citizens all the time, almost at any costs. Dont believe me, then check out this site if you thought the internet is unchecked.   urlLink FBI's Info Stealing Program

      I love that movie! It always makes me laugh when I see it. I remember the first time I saw it was when I was on the USS Belleau Wood and this other corpsman was like, "you have never seen Super Troopers"????? As if it was a crime. I realize now that it is a crime not to see this movie!!!!!  I am going to work today. I got a lot of people overthere hooked on making websites; you can do a lot with the free yahoo web site account. Now its non-stop. Hey Rob can you take a look at this file for my web site, hey Rob how do I edit this part of my web site...etc...etc. Its actually kinda funny but it can be tasking sometimes when 2 people are in the room both editing their web sites and both asking me questions about them.   July 4th. Its my uncles b-day and my other uncles b-day is on the 9th so I have to spend more money and get people presents! I think I will make a couple cool CD's for them and then get them some lottery tickets. What can I do??? I am poor.

      Well its my firday...I am at work now but not for long. I am going over to a friends house and wathc Super Troopers I think. Then I will probably watch Rocky. I love that movie. It so sad, then he rises to fame, but really in the end that meant nothing becasue he had Adrianne and he made his peace with Mickey.   Math is really intense, if I hear anymore  x to the coefficeint of y cubed over the absolute value of -4 to the 5th power......my head will explode!!!!!!!!  More to come later.

       I already hate the term "old school." It is so fake and phony. Another one is "I have a lot on my plate." Whatever, just suck it up you whinny bitch and get on with it. Shut up or kill yourself if you can't handle your "plate."    I finished my research paper revision and I am confident that I will get a good grade on it. I man, I just forgot to revise another paper. I will do that tomorrow!    School's out next week. I want to get my registration date in the mail soon so I can register for fall. People are like, "I did that already when I registered for summer." So what! I hate doing that and I shouldn't have to!!!!!!!   I can't wait to clean up my room and get rid of a lot of paperwork trash I have been saving from school. I want to make room for an eisel so I can draw more easily. Also make more room for computers!!!!!!  Damn, I was thinking of going on a blind date thru a mutal friend but then I came to my senses! Why the heck would I want to go thru de-Robification for some stupid broad????? Focus baby! I on the prize....a degree.

      I didn't do anything last night. I watched TV and then I got really tired. I listened to Art Bell on am1080 KEX for awhile while I was drifting in and out of sleep. I finished my English paper today. The rough draft anyways. Man, I wish I could just win the lottery so I can do what I really want with my life. Money....maybe I should rob a bank. LOL. That would be stupid and futile. Now, computer hacking into a bank....lol, that may work. I could never do that, at least not from my current setup and location.   I tried to setup my router/network briefly. It was pissing me off and I need to clean my room. This next week, I will this guy at work to see if he can't help me out. I know nerworking, enough to get by and troubleshoot at work, but for the first time setup, I would like someone with more experience to walk me through it. I know I can figure it out but I do not want to spend needless hours if I do not have to.   The fountain was dry again today. I saw it on the way to Quiznos.

        I have no one to go out with tonight. This sucks. I wanna get trashed...I think but I don't want to go to a bar then come home to my parents house and have to hear anything. I miss the good old years of having my own place. But then I wasn't in school or anything. When I was in the military, I could do my job in my sleep. Now school and work however are a constantly changing thing so I have to make sure I stay on top of things. Well, I guess I will just go home and watch tv...hurray for me.

      I can't wait to setup my network in my room. It will let me practice and learn new skills and let me download lots and lots of stuff when I don't want to tie up my main desktop or even when I am not at home. Then I will hook my X-Box up to my network also then the fun will begin.   I drove past the fountain near Millplain and 164th st. and it was dry. I want to see suds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Is that too much for a guy to ask?  I made my outline for my research paper. I even started the into and thesis too. I will finish it tomorrow. I can't seem to get into a groove here at work when it comes to English homework or art. Wow, I still have my final art project to do. I have to draw 5 objects that represent me. Can't I just draw a mushroom cloud and get it over with?????????  I have more and more ideas for new inventions or just improvements on existing stuff. I need to team up with someone who knows business and who believes in my visions.

      Well, after debate (almost 2 years) I think I will begin to subscribe to the  urlLink  Lykis 101  , well at least 75% of it or more. I am not all for the go out and bang as amny women as you want or can mentallity, but I do agree with my new "father" that the majority of women are gold diggers. Few are not, but then they have their own drawbacks and flaws....like trying to change you into their own "dream" of what a husband or mate should be. "F" all that jazz!!!   It's sad but to have feelings...makes you vulnerable. At least mask them and conceal them so they can never be used agaisnt you.

      I saw a ad on  urlLink Craigslist.org  for a router/firewall for $15 in Gladstone, Oregon. So I get there like at 6:30ish pm and he seemed nice enough. His house was kinda secluded from the road so it was a little creepy. He was nerdly though and small so I wasn't afraid but when he said come check out some other equipment he had for sale in his basement, my life sorta flashed before my eyes. I mean, you hear it all the time. Guy goes over to someones house and gets lured in and then WHAM, gets hit in the head while in the basement. Well it was on the up and up and I looked at his stuff but didn't want any of it. Just a creepy yet fun experience overall.    Phil Hendrie is on..........must listen....can't stop!

Man, jsut now I was talking to Rob, this other Rob I know, he is a really cool guy and he gave me some really good ideas on how to setup my own network in my room.

      I heard somehting funny today. I was listening to the  Rick Emerson show on 910am , he was talking about nuns and how they are not hot. He said that he remembered a nun that looked like Brian Denehey (the dad from Tommy Boy) with that nun hat on. I was dying because I went to catholic private schools almost all my early school career. Then he started to talk about "diesel lesbians" and how they kick ass and stuff. I really enjoy that show. I want to find a website that has show downloads for free. I found a website that has tons of  Phile Hendrie  mp3's on it for  free !   So I was thinking today. I was kinda down and just thought where will I be in 10 years? My answer to myself was living in a modest home somewhere in or around Vancouver alone. That actually made me happy. I think the happiest times I can remember was in my Oceanside and Fallbrooke apartments in California. Well, my old apartment in Vancouver I had before the Navy was cool too. I remember the times when people from work would try to get me to go out with them and I just told them I was busy. They alwasy bugged me about being a hermit. I loved it though. I read books all the time, played my PS2, and watched dvd's while tossing back some beers. Man, I felt great. I felt totally free, I came in when I wanted, left when I wanted and best of all....I answered to no one. I had a phone but I always had the ringer off or I just let it ring then I *69'ed it to see if it was work or not! LOL. Those were the days baby!
