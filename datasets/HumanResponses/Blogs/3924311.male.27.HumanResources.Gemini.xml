      Yea, silence is the key. I try only to speak about job stuff. The rest of the time, may the silence rule the place. Why? Because I´m trying to forget her and the first step to forget a girl u have to see everyday is ignoring her. So I hardly say a word.

      First off, let me say that English is not my native tongue but I want this to be understood for as much people as possible. So, why "Old words for a new blog"? Well, the "new blog" part is easy: this is the first time that I do something like this. And the "old words"? That´s the reason I´m putting these words here.  Right now I´m in the office. My hands, my fingers, my knees are shaking; I´m lucky of being sit down. I also have a little headache and my stomach hurts bad. Do I have the flu? Nope, but it´s because of something as old as the flu: I´m in love.   I admit it, I´m in love with one of my office mates; in fact, she´s my only mate because there´s only the two of us here at the offcice. We´re completly alone.   I don´t wanna tell all the story now from the beginning, I´ll do it on another time. Today, I just need to say that she´s not in love with me. She hasn´t told it that way, but I know it and the knowing of it it´s what´s killing me deep inside, making me feel really really bad. I don´t know words in English to express the pain I´m going thru but I´m sure many of you know what I´m talking about. So you can imagine my situation. She´s only a few steps away from me but that distance is an abyss I cannot jump. So close and so far. I wanna reach out and touch her, feel her skin (the smoothest skin ever) but I can´t. And I´m dying. That´s pretty close to what I´m feeling now; I feel like I´m dying.   Why she didn´t tell me that she didn´t feel anything about me?  Why did she let me believe that I had any opportunity with her?
