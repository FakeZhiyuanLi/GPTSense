						   Ok, so the wedding was on July 24, and I'm just now getting around to writing about it.&nbsp; It was fun, got to see a lot of people.&nbsp; Kevin has pictures posted on his  urlLink website . &nbsp;I ended up with the garder, wink wink.&nbsp; One of the best parts of the reception was the final dance...we danced to Tunak Tunak by the talented Daler Mehndi.&nbsp; I've gone ahead and posted both the  urlLink MP3  and  urlLink Video  of this wonderful song.&nbsp; The video is a real file though...don't hurt me, that's all I could find.&nbsp; The girl serving at the recpetion tried to card me for chapage, cause she thought I was too young.&nbsp; So that got me a little pissed off.  After the wedding we went and hung out at Ed's hotel, the Hilton, and spent some time in the hot tub, that felt so relaxing.&nbsp; Then we went out to eat and meet up with Jason.&nbsp; On Sunday is when I drove back to Seattle, or at least tried.&nbsp; I ended up breaking down just South of Baker City.&nbsp; I nice trucker stopped and gave me a ride to a gas station where I called for a tow.&nbsp; I ended up having to spend the night there, and the girl at the hotel I stayed at carded me, cause she didn't think I was over 18, and they don't rent rooms to people under 18...turns out I'm older than she is :-P&nbsp; Monday morning, finally got my car fixed and drove up to Seattle, talk about a long and expensive weekend.

						   weee...the bachlor party rocked.&nbsp; We conviced some people that I was the one getting married, cause the guy getting married was ridding in a different.&nbsp; So, I'm a little...drunk...not too sure how much I had tonight, but I know I only had 1 beer (bitch beer that is), everything else was hard A.&nbsp; I had a good time, I got to relax and have fun with my buddies.&nbsp; It's good to relax.&nbsp; Wedding is tomorro, so I'll be in my tux and ready for pixs by 12:30pm.&nbsp; Well, it's late (or early depending on how you look at it) so I'm going to crash on Eric's couch...so my parents don't know I was out drinking...hehe

						   Well, by 8:30pm tonight I really wanted to pack up and go back to Boise.&nbsp; Had a hard day at work, don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the work, it's a lot of fun, just don't like having to keep changing the same small thing, over and over again, because everyone thinks that things should be done slightly differently or in a slightly different location....ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh I just have to remember that God has put me here for a reason, and He won't put me in any situation that I can't handle.&nbsp; I'm starting to make friends, so that's good.&nbsp; Meet more people at bible study tonight, beats me what their names are though :)&nbsp; And, I'll be in Boise this weekend, get to see Kira's baby, and see everyone at the wedding.&nbsp; Sleepy sleepy time now..........

						   Fellowship was tonight's sermon topic, and how we no longer have the "agape" feast, so after the sermon everyone went into the fellowship hall for pizza, fellowship, and each table took communion on their own.&nbsp; The key verse for the sermon was Luke 14:12-14 - "The Jesus said to his host, 'When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.&nbsp; But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind. and you will be blessed.&nbsp; Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.'" (NIV)  So, I hung out, ate pizza, and meet new people.&nbsp; I sat with a family, didn't get their names, and Pat, the pastor's son.&nbsp; The father of the family was pretty cool, they asked what I do, and I told them, and he just went off and on different projects that he's been on, which were pretty cool.&nbsp; He also talked about him and his dad doing stuff with X10, and hooking X10 up with hot tubs.

						   Yesterday Erik and I went to the Bite of Seattle, on the way there traffic was so bad, I ended up cutting in front of someone, and ended up "tapping" the pickup in front of us.&nbsp; We got to looking at the pickup and saw the license plate cover and it said "Alumni Washington Status University", great I tapped someone from Wazzu, but there was no damage, so scratch.&nbsp; We followed him for awhile, since we were going in the same direction, he finally got out at a stop light and checked his bumpper, I apoligized, and he said since there was any damage to not worry about it, and he turned right and we turned left and went out separte ways. &nbsp; When we finally made it down to the Seattle Center area, parking was expensive, so I found&nbsp;a spot to parallel park :D&nbsp; I ended about half way up on the curb, but hey, I was out of the way.&nbsp; There were so many people at the Bite of Seattle, virtually no where to sit, and it's been a very long time since I've felt like a minority, and boy did Erik and I stand out, at least we thought so.&nbsp; There were a lot of freaks out there too, saw 1 guy with a rather large spiky mohauk.&nbsp; We stayed for about an hour, then left.&nbsp; The food wasn't anything special, the ads said that 50 area resturants would have booths there, but it was mostly fair food, stuff you see at just about any fair or carnival. &nbsp; After the Bite of Seattle we came back to Kirkland, than around 9:30pm we went downtown since we've noticed that at night Kirkland gets rather busy.&nbsp; Walked by a couple of places that I'll have to go back and check out sometime, and I don't have to feel bad being that 1 guy sitting there all alone, saw a couple of different people that were all by themselves. &nbsp; Guess I should start getting my stuff together to go to work, weee, as long as I'm out of there by 5:30pm so I can make it to church :)

						   My trip here to the Seattle area has been great! I've been trying to plan a weekend to come up and see David for awhile and it was perfec timing.  Did a lot of fun stuff including: visiting Pike's Market, seeing the Blue Angels, taking some time to wander through the IKEA store and look for furniture for David's apartment, I bought more than he though, since he didn't actually buy anything this time.  We went to the lab/office. David showed me his work~which since I didn't get to see the Senior Design when I went to his graduation, was very much anticipated. It was, for lack of a better word, Astounding.  I am one of the only ones in the family that actually understands computers and what David does, so I have been in on his projects from the start. I was surprised at how far it has come and been developed farther than I was expecting.  David is SOO excited about this project, his child-like excitement in showing me the demo-room was contagious and relieving. David is doing something he loves and is excited about it-I am proud to say the least...Okay enough of the sappy stuff...the project Rocks!! David's nerdness pays off, who would have ever guessed but me of course. Never had a doubt!  So Seattle is great and fun, and relaxing gettaway for myself with some great company, but as all great things end-I need to head home and go back to my job and home.  Have fun World!

						   There were 2 rather odd deaths in the news today, first one was a 13 year old boy that died after running from a bear.  He didn't die because the bear caught him, nor did he run off a cliff, he died from respiratory distress.   urlLink Kid dies running from bear .  US has the most over weight people in the world, and the most out of shape people in the world.  Granted, I'd have some respiratory distress too if I had to run for my life, but I wouldn't drop over dead from it...I hope.  The second odd death, wasn't really that odd as much as it was a very traject accident.  Man in England was prunning a tree with a chainsaw while his wife was below him working in the garden, he fell and the chainsaw landed on her, nough said.  I can't find the link anymore.  My question is, why was she below him, while he's on a ladder with a chainsaw, that's just asking for trouble.  Umm, maybe someone should submit these 2 to the Darwin awards.   urlLink Real offbeat news  you've got to check out this article, some people will do anything for their pets.  blah blah blah, yea it was one of those days, but tomorrow will be better, why you ask, cause I said so :P

						   Well...more or less I guess. I finally moved my bed in from the living room, where it's been against the wall since I got back from the wedding. It's so nice to sleep on a bed and not the floor. Put my desk together too, now my computer isn't on the floor, so I can lay in bed and watch TV on my computer now :) Got my DVDs and VeggieTales stuff unpacked today. I think I'm going to put my Legos on the bottom shelf of my little book shelf instead of text books. Heather is planning on coming up and visiting next weekend, not for sure though. She's going to help me pick out some couches. Hopefully I have enough money for couches, I spent over $800 last week with my car breaking down, and getting a hitch put on, and renting a trailer and hotel room. Which reminds me, I need to get the recipe for being towed mailed into my insurance so they reimburse me.  Project at work is pretty much done, MS will be in on Tuesday to check it out, they were suppose to be in a Friday, but rescheduled. Not too sure what will happen with work after this though, guess time will tell.  Got to remember, no matter what, I'm here for a reason.
