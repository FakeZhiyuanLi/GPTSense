I was supposed to recieve an official offer package almost a week ago but it was never sent due to some administrative glitch. 
I just found out today that they are now resending it. 
  
I also attended a mandatory session about getting a training Visa for the US. Looks like I need a US banking account to get paid.

I was just informed that I'm going to be living in a different apt. than the one I was originally supposed to be in. 
For what it's worth, my address will be
  
1540 Vista Club Circle, #306, 
Santa Clara, CA 95054
  
...in case anybody wants to write me on dead tree (hint hint).

I just heard from the travel agency. 
Looks like I'll be flying out of TO at noon on Aug 24th and returning at 9pm on Dec 20th. 
That gives me about a week of play-time before I have to start work.

I finally heard from my manager today, so now I know that I'll be starting work on Sept 2nd and finishing up on Dec 19th. 
That information allowed me to finalize my housing arrangements, which means I'll be moving into my apt. on Aug 29th. 
  
Also, it turns out that I will indeed be working with James Gosling himself! 
It's going to be amazing to work with the creator of the Java language :-)

I recieved my passport the day before yesterday via registered mail, a scant 6 days after I applied for it. I have to admit I'm thoroughly impressed by the speed of our beaurocracy.

This is my traveblog, in which I shall chronicle my adventures in Silicon Valley this fall (2003). 
  
Today also happens to be Canada day but, since nobody knows about this blog yet, I'm not going to wish anyone a happy Canada day.

Although I flew into SF from TO on Sunday, we headed back to Sacramento almost immediately. 
However, thanks to the ignorance of the INS officer at SFO,  urlLink I was back in SF  on Tuesday. 
While waiting for my number to come up at the INS office in SF, I was able to take in a few of the tourist traps downtown.
  
My uncle took me to this very beatnik bookstore, where all the radical thinkers from the 60s used to chill. 
They even had a poetry reading room at the top!
The book selection was a little eclectic but a refreshing change from the tripe usually found at Chapters et al. 
We actually managed to spend almost an hour just walking through the place because we couldn't avoid picking up the books that caught our eye as we walked past them.
  
When it came time for lunch we retrieved my aunt & little cousin from her office &amp; ate at a Japanese joint. 
The most interesting thing I noticed there was that they use  real  crab flesh in their California rolls.
I was quite impressed by the ease with which my aunt was able to quaff wasabi, since I've never developed a tolerence for the stuff.
  
After lunch, my uncle &amp; I walked down to the pier, where the sea port is located. 
We scared a seagull &amp; convinced a random dude to take  urlLink a pic of us  with my digicam before going into what promised to be the actual sea port building.
Sadly, the building was nothing more than a mall so we didn't stick around long.
There was some interesting industrial sculpture outside it though, so  urlLink I climbed atop a large concrete sphere  to watch the people go by for a bit. 
  
After I had my I-94 in hand, we had a couple of beers at this quirky little microbrewery since it was happy hour &amp; they offered drinks for a buck each. 
The beer was good, although not as good as Hoegartens or that stuff at Brewtopia in Montreal. 
The bar did have some really fascinating ceiliing fans though; 
They were actually mounted on a long rod that stretched acrosss the ceiling and spun the blades like parallel catherine wheels!
  
The last thing we did before heading home was to grab a pre-supper snack at this Indian restaurant. 
While we were there, one of the other patrons expostulated that it was the 2 nd  best Indian joint he'd ever been in. 
The other one is in Santa Clara, where I'll be living, but I cannot remember the name of the place any more :-(
Besides, I'm not convinced it could compare to Gerard street in TO...

Yes, I am still alive &amp; kicking. Three very intense days have gone by since I left TO so this is going to be a whopper of a post. 
  
First, some background: I am being allowed to work in the US this fall on a J1 visa, which is designed for students in specialized fields to gain practical training. As a Canadian, I was supposed to have my Visa stamped and pick up an I-94 from US customs at the port of entry when I crossed the border. Sounds simple enough, except that I was told that all flights from Canada to the US were now considered international. Consequently, I was expecting to encounter US customs when I landed in San Francisco so, when I was asked for my passport at Pearson, I didn't volunteer the document that was supposed to get me an I-94, thinking it was simply a preliminary examination. And when I was asked for the purpose of my visit, I said I was going for a 4-month training program, unfortunately neglecting to mention the J1. 
  
The customs officer misunderstood my intentions &amp; thought I was just another Canuck crossing the border for pleasure. As a result, my passport was not stamped and I was not given an I-94, which I require to start working in the US. At the time, I did not realize that something was amiss, believing that this process would happen when I got off the plane. It was only when I picked up my luggage in SFO that the horrible truth dawned upon me. My mind rushing, I quickly decided that I should contact US immigration &amp; see if they would do the needful at SFO, which I figured would be a major port of entry. 
  
The officer at the immigration office in the airport said that I needed to go to an INS office during business hours and ask for a deferred inspection. Since I was going to be in the state capital (Sacramento) for the next few days, he suggested visiting the INS office there in the morning. Unfortunately, when I went there, I was told that this inspection could only be done at the INS office in downtown SF. 
  
Thanks to much assistance from the relatives with whom I am spending time this week, I got to the INS office in SF at slightly after 8 am on the 26th. After standing in line for about 45 mins, I managed to get a number barely 15 mins before they ran out for the day. Realizing that it would be several hours before my number came up, I went gallivanting around SF with my uncle until there were only a few numbers remaining. As it happened, I was using the washroom when my number was called unexpectedly early, thanks to some no-shows being skipped over. Most fortunately, my uncle was able to convince the officer not to skip over me. She turned out to be very nice, in fact, unlike the officer who issued me a number earlier. After examining my paperwork, she sent me up to the 9 th  floor. 
  
Upstairs, another officer took my paperwork and made us wait for about 45 mins before he issued me an I-94, gave me a backdated stamp on my passport &amp; confirmed that I was now aware of the importance of mentioning the J1 at customs when entering the US. Heaving a collosal sigh of relief, I walked out of the building.

BuskerFest is in town. I stopped by the St. Lawrence market for an hour today evening and had a chance to watch a couple of performers. The 1 st  was a contortionist/juggler/comedian from Oz. When I showed up he had just started his act and was telling jokes in an attempt to draw a larger crowd. Once he was satisfied with the size of his following, he began to do a few warm-up contortions, which included bringing his arms over his head from behind his back with hands clasped. I wasn't impressed yet but I kept watching, since he had promised the show would keep getting better. 
  
He followed that up by  urlLink passing his entire body through a squash racquet whose strings had been removed . Admittedly, I've never done that myself but it didn't look  that  difficult, although I had to admire the aplomb with which he pulled it off. Next came his final act, for which he selected several volunteers from the audience. No sooner had he launched into his schpiel than a pair of old men began to fight over who had the right to an unobstructed view of the performance! I have to give him credit for handling this potentially volatile situation quite fluidly while continuing to spout jokes. After dispensing with the grumpy old men, the busker proceeded to climb atop a steel pole, upon which he juggled first  urlLink balls  and then  urlLink knives . That was a fine sight indeed. 
  
The other act I saw was a pair of jugglers from Tokyo, who made heavy use of ethnically charged slapstick to hold audience interest as they  urlLink progressed through their repartoire . Even  urlLink the best of their antics  did not beat what I had seen earlier but I did enjoy watching them juggle wooden boxes on umbrellas.

Thinking it would be a good idea to confirm my flight details a few days in advance, I called Air Canada yesterday. 
I was shocked to find out that they had been  urlLink rendered helpless  
by one of the recent Windows virii. 
The individual I spoke to suggested I call them back in a day or two, by which point he expected that they would have the problem under control.
This is rather disconcerting, to say the least.

Not even the Great Blackout of 2003 was sufficient to derail the plans that Lex &amp; I had made to visit Sarah in Ottawa. 
After confirming that power had been restored to the Enterprise office where he was to pick up the car, Lex called me &amp; we agreed to proceed as originally planned. 
He drove down to TO and picked me up in a silver  car from the future , 
whereupon we played some of my CDs until we got to Kingston. 
Since I'd never eaten at a Denny's before, I convinced Lex that we should have dinner there, which we did. 
I've decided I like the food at Denny's. 
By the time we reached Ottawa it was dark so we just sat around for a wee bit &amp; 
watched  a really bad TV show  before turning in. 
  
The next day I rose bright &amp; ridiculously early (as usual) but even Sarah wasn't up yet 
so I wandered off to the Bytowne market to amuse myself for a couple of hours. 
By the time I left it, I had procured a couple of avacados, a small box of rasberries and a dozen Montreal bagels. 
When I got back to Sarah's digs, we loaded our stuff into the car &amp; went to pick up Sarah's friend Laura. 
Having done that, we picked up a few last-minute items from a grocery store and drove into the Gatts.
  
The beach was not as desolate as we had hoped for and none of us had remembered to bring our frisbees.
However, minor inconveniences of that nature are easy to ignore on a sunny day, especially at the beach. 
We swam around &amp; played catch (with my indestructible watch) in the water until we were exhausted &amp; cold. 
Then we sat around on the sand &amp; ate snacks for a bit before leaving.
  
The journey back turned into a veritable odyssey as we took time to explore random hamlets in Quebec. 
Encouraged by the great mileage the car was getting, we initially decided to stop in a little place that I was told had fantastic ice-cream. 
When we finally got there, it turned out to be nothing more spectacular than standard fare Nestle ice-cream.
In its defence, the store had a very picturesque statue of a bearcub carved out of a tree trunk beside it. 
For some inexplicable reason, I was the only one who seemed to think so...
  
To be contd...

Power has finally been restored here in downtown Toronto after the unprecedented blackout that lasted about 14 hours. Yesterday evening was certainly interesting. I had just put stuff into the washer in the laundromat &amp; was in the elevator going up. The elevator stopped at the lobby &amp; then the power failed with the doors half-open. Not wanting to stick around, I squeezed through them &amp; walked up instead. Shortly thereafter, I found out that the power outage had taken down the entire Eastern seaboard. 
  
Rather than mope around at home, my family elected to take to the streets. Apparently, millions of others had the same thought. It was nice to see so many people walking around. It was a tad less nice when I realized that the few bars &amp; restaurants still open were filled to capacity. After much wandering, we managed to find a Pizza Pizza that was operational - hurray for gas stoves - and procured some dinner, which we consumed as the sun set. I don't think I've ever seen so many stars in TO! Walking back home was a bit of an adventure but there were sufficient random emergency lights to find my way. Apparently the elevators were actually running, although I didn't realize this at the time &amp; walked up 20 storeys.

I've always liked Ben Folds, although I'd never heard him live. So when Magic Dave suggested we go to a combined Ben Folds &amp; Tori Amos concert, I decided it would be fun. We ended up driving from Waterloo to downtown Toronto, grabbing sashimi en route, briefly getting lost on the highways &amp; getting to the ampitheatre in Ontario Place with minutes to spare. Because I was hungry again by the time we entered the park, we bought fries and ate them while fending off a squad of intrepid birds by thrusting plastic forks at them. 
  
Ben Folds was most entertainng, with his charecteristic blend of satirical banter &amp; whimsical ivory-tickling. I loved how he would actually stand up to bang on the piano when he wanted to play the notes  really loudly . He also experimented with having the audience simulate the horn section in a couple of songs using their combined vocal chords. Unsurprisingly, his tirade against the genre of music promulgated by Korn was met with keen laughter from the crowd. 
  
The diva herself finally appeared onstage amidst much applause, wrapped in a long dress as flowing as it was frilly. 
She sat down at her mind-bogglingly expensive piano and began to play as she sang. 
Right away I was struck by her voice, which was both rich &amp; melodious. 
After a few songs, she switched to playing the harpsichord instead. 
I've been a fan of the harpsichord ever since I first heard it being played solo last summer.
What was most impressive, however, was when she began playing both instruments at once - each with a different hand - while gazing at her audience. 
  
My favourite song of the evening was undoubtedly "Cornflake Girl". 
Judging by the response of everyone around me, I'm not alone with that opinion.
Several random girls broke out into dance when she sang that song.
It was also the reason for her stage backdrop, which had a girl's face with cornflakes for hair.
  
By the time she was done, I had decided I thoroughly enjoyed her music &amp; would happily accept an autograph if she were to grace me with one. 
I think I might procure a few of her albums, especially the one with "Cornflake Girl".

Plans are now underway for Lex &amp; I to drive up to Ottawa for the Aug 15-17 weekend, where I'm sure Sarah will have plenty of kewl stuff  TM  planned for us. We've also managed to acquire a passenger who goes by the pseudonym of Sean.

Yesterday I called SunDial (Sun has lots of cute little names for its various programs) to register for an intern orientation, which mostly involves an hour of paperwork. 
  
After being informed by my friend Nathan Babcock of an exciting conference being held in Palo Alto, I signed up for it. So I'll be attending the Accelerating Change conference on Sept 12-14 :-)  
There's also this O'Reilly Mac OS X conference at the end of Oct that I'm looking at but I don't need to sign up for it until Sept 15 so I think I'll wait until I'm actually down there before making plans for that one, since it takes place during the workweek, rather than on a weekend.

Sun Labs has a neat tradition called the Intellectual Dessert; every Tuesday at 3pm somebody gives an hour-long presentation about their ongoing research. They're usually quite interesting &amp; serve to keep people at the lab in touch with what their collegues are doing. Today's presentation was about  urlLink an amazing breakthrough that was recently in the news : Proximity Interconnect. 
  
Rob Drost (with a little help from Ivan Sutherland) gave an overview of the technology &amp; followed it with some fairly detailed (and classified) explanations of how this new design is made possible. Rob is an excellent speaker so my rudimentary knowledge of electrical circuits &amp; rusty knowledge of chip design were sufficient for me to follow almost everything he said.

This morning I made my course selection for the upcoming term. After surviving Graphics this summer, I've decided to proceed with my plan of taking Compilers &amp; Programming Languages simultaneously, although I'll be taking only 4 courses this time, instead of the full courseload I bore in the summer. Apparently these 2 courses complement each other extremely well &amp; tend to result in massive Eureka moments during the term; should be a nice finale to my undergrad CS career. 
  
Still pursuing my goal of pulling off a double major with English Rhetoric as the other barrel, I plan to take the 1st-year English course that I still need as well as one of the core 3rd-year Rhetoric offerings. Having a 1st-year course will allow me to expend more time on Compilers, which will probably chew up every minute I can spare. I tried to enroll in  Rhetoric: Principles &amp; Practice  (Engl 309A) but Quest wouldn't let me because I am missing the prerequisite, which isn't even offered this winter. However, I have been assured by the prof (Michael MacDonald, whom I had for Semiotics last autumn) that he will let me in regardless so I've selected a dummy 1st-year course (to avoid running into trouble with the administration over tuition) &amp; will switch the courses as needed during my 1st week back on campus. 
  
Right now my schedule has all my lectures on Tue &amp; Thurs but once I do the course switcharoo, some of that will be moved to Monday.

I got my cellphone bill a few days ago &amp; it was due tomorrow so I tried to pay it by credit card. However, MetroPCS has the most stringent anti-fraud measure I've ever seen. They even wanted to verify my zip code &amp; street number! Of course, since I was trying to use a Canadian credit card, this failed miserably :-(
I had to pay the bill in person at a mall, which cost me an extra $3. On the bright side, I finally received my bank card for the account I opened almost 2 weeks ago.

I cooked some butternut squash today, mashing it &amp; stirring in some maple syrup. It's one of those dishes that I'd never eaten until after I started school at UW. My former landlady Betty Ann introduced me to it &amp; I now try to make it at least once every term. Usually, I use 3-4 squash &amp; it lasts me about a week. 
  
The other event of note for today is that I finished reading  Sophie's World , which has taken me about 5 weeks of irregular reading to get through. What a book though! I'm exceedingly glad my sister cajoled me into reading it just before I left TO. I heartily recommend it to anybody with a casual interest in philosophy who also enjoys reading. 
I recently purchased a book called  Barbarians led by Bill Gates  from Amazon after reading a glowing appraisal of it on James Gosling's home page. I think I'll read that next.

I went to the Berkeley campus with my roommate &amp; 3 other interns yesterday. The trip is a bit under an hour each way. The area surrounding campus has a smorgasbord of ethnic restaurants &amp; a fair number of student-oriented stores, like a bike shop &amp; a skateboard shop. The campus itself is massive (compared to UW) &amp; set on the side of a hill, which meant we had an uphill climb to the other side. 
  
Unlike UW, Berkeley has campus maps all over the place, which allowed us to plot a course that let us see most of the buildings without getting lost &amp; having to revisit landmarks repeatedly. The campus is also very clean, which we attributed to the fact that they probably have enough money to hire a cleanup crew on a regular &amp; frequent basis. We also noticed a surprising number of infants being carried around or pushed along on strollers; another departure from what we're used to at UW. 
  
After our long climb up the hill, we arrived at the football stadium, where a game was in session against Santa Cruz, which is apparently the #3 ranked team in the state. We considered going in to watch the game but sticker shock convinced us otherwise. Instead, we sauntered through the frat district, where we saw hordes of drunken undergrads standing on the roofs &amp; balconies taking to each other loudly. By this time we were in need of  a little something  so we consulted one of the omnipresent campus maps &amp; headed over to the shopping district on Telegraph st.
  
Here we were confronted by a veritable bazaar, with aging hippies hawking all manners of trinkets, mostly handmade. There were also a few mainstream stores &amp; eventually found an inviting pizza joint with a deck out front. The place made excellent calzones and even had a hippie sitting on the deck with his large dog. Every so often, he would sing along with the music, which never ceased to amuse us. Having stuffed ourselves silly, we decided it was time to leave as the sun was threatening to set &amp; so we walked back to the car &amp; drove home.

I went to a pub in San Jose yesterday with the same crew. What I didn't realize was that the place didn't serve food. I mean, what kind of pub doesn't serve food!? Aware that drinking on an empty stomach isn't such a hot idea, I stayed dry most of the night until we decided to finish off with a round of scotch on the rocks. However, we got a lot more scotch in our glasses than we had been expecting &amp; I was soon plastered. 
  
While I was there, I realized that it wasn't as much fun being at a pub with these people as it had been when I would go to pubs with my friends in Waterloo. Those were more relaxed &amp; friendly experiences. This time I was a bit on edge the whole time, even when I could no longer have walked in a straight line. I guess it could be because I don't know the other interns well enough yet.

Last night 4 other Sun interns &amp; I went to Indian Oven in San Francisco for dinner. The food was wonderful, marred only by the complete lack of parking anywhere remotely near the restaurant. 
  
Today I also visited the post office &amp; found out that they do have special stamps just for Canada. I bought a pack of 20 so I might end up actually sending people snail mail if I run out of reasons to use them before I leave here.

 Warning : this entry is on the geeky side so my nontechnical readers probably won't get much out of it.
  
Having seen my original project - the semi-complete tree visualizer for Java source code that I inherited - through to completion, I've been given a larger one that should take up the rest of my time here. This time I'll be writing a symbol tree verifier for our source code transformation engine. It looks like I'll be diving deep into the bowels of the Java compiler in the process, which ought to prove very handy when I take the compiler construction course this winter. The first step will be to shadow the syntax analyser, validating the partially reattributed symbol tree for consistency with the existing abstract syntax tree where the stock syntax analyser would normally add nodes to a nascant symbol tree.

On Friday night a bunch of us Sun co-ops checked out the nightlife in San Jose; nothing special. I think I'll stick to The City in future.
  
Had a water-pistol fight with my cousin Lorraine &amp; her (unrelated to me) cousin Kyle. Spent the rest of the weekend at my uncle's place in Fremont, managing to spin a lot of cycles in a less than completely successful attempt at setting him up with a triple-boot system; damn shortsighted BIOS manufacturers...
  
Went to a farmer's market, where they had cheap avacadoes; still not as cheap as Ottawa though! My aunt cooked dinner &amp; even gave me some to take home. Nothing quite like home-cooked food :-)

I'm back from the ACC 2003, which lasted all weekend. I met several intriguing people &amp; learned a lot, mostly about AI &amp; nanotech. I also had some interesting experiences while working around the despicable lack of decent public transit in Silicon Valley. Here's my story. 
  
After the weekly Bash on Friday, Mike Godfrey dropped me off at Tressider Union on the Stanford campus in Palo Alto, where the conference was being held. I signed in at the registration desk &amp; then proceeded to mingle with the other attendees, all of whom were conveniently wearing name tags. It was during this time that I had a chance to initially meet some of the individuals with whom I had several invigorating conversations over the course of the weekend. 
At around 9:30 I got a ride to the nearest VTA transit station with  urlLink Peter Voss , who has been working on  urlLink an Artificial General Intelligence project  for some time now. I caught the 22, which took me to the Santa Clara transit centre, from which I was supposed to get home via the 60. Unfortunately, the last 60 for the night had already left. 
Stranded, I tried calling my roommate on my cellphone, whose battery was almost dead. Unfortunately, however, he was not in. Next I tried Maria in San Jose, who wasn't sure where the transit centre was but promised to find it &amp; come rescue me, which she did. By the time I finally got home it was well past midnight &amp; the conference was scheduled to resume at 9am the next day. 
I needed a better travel plan. 
  
By the time I was done with breakfast on Saturday morning I had come to a very useful realization: the transit systems in Silicon Valley made up in bike-friendliness what they lacked in coverage. Inspired by this new perspective, I biked down to El Camino Real, caught the 22, loaded my bike onto the rack at the front, rode it all the way to Stanford &amp; then biked across campus to the conference venue, getting there with minutes to spare. 
  
As it turned out, the begining of the day was plagued by technical difficulties, arising from a last-minute attempt to get a complicated &amp; relatively unproven holographic projection system running in a room filled with EM interference from a panapoly of comunication systems. The keynote by Ray Kurzweil began almost an hour late and we were never able to actually see him. He spoke about the increasingly quickening pace of technological development &amp; what it heralds for the next couple of decades. This was followed by a debate between him &amp; 2 physically present naysayers whose objections he was able to vanquish for the most part. 
  
I spent lunch engaged in a lively discussion about the state of the global economy with  urlLink 2 fascinating women from LA  whom I'd met the previous evening &amp; an impressively knowledgable elderly gentleman who never actually introduced himself to me. 
After lunch I attended a talk about genetic programming by a Stanford CS prof. It seems that this approach to programming can trivialize conventional engineering problems, although it does nothing to help with problems that cannot be formally stated or whose potential solutions cannot be automatically verified. Nevertheless, designing new circuits, logic controllers, algorithms and the like can now be done via evolution of randomly generated code. 
  
He was followed by  urlLink Ben Goertzel , whose talk about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) forced me to begin rethinking my plans for grad school. I had planned to conduct research into the creation of machine intelligence that would be able to learn how to understand &amp; use human languages. However, Ben's talk made me realize that this would be impossible until we have an AGI that has acquired the basic human life experiences of a 2-3 year-old human child, after which picking up language would likely be trivial. 
  
The next few hours consisted of 3 speculative speeches about the origins of the universe, followed by a debate between the 3 speakers about the various theories that are currently prevalent. Some of it was interesting but , as expected, there was no progress on the problem of trying to prove theories that seem to be inherently unprovable. 
Then we had a dramatic switch of gears as Sun Microsystems CTO Greg Papadopoulos spoke about how networked devices are continuing to change our lives. As expected, he got in a few good digs at the beast of Redmond. He was certainly the most entertaining speaker at the conference, peppering his talk with more than enough hilarity to ensure that everybody stayed awake &amp; paid attention. He even managed to sneak in an allusion to My Big Fat Greek Wedding when he joked that the Greek words for large numbers were much better than the latin ones so beloved by the computer industry. 
  
The dinner tables were tagged with questions to stimulate discussion so I went around looking for the most interesting one. That was when I met the legendary (well, at UW, anyway)  urlLink Ka Ping Yee , who followed my lead &amp; did the same thing. Apparently he is now pursuing a PhD in CS, exploring software for group discussions. 
I ended up having dinner with Ben Goertzel &amp; a friend of his from a former AI company as well as a few other students also interested in AI. Oddly enough, we almost ignored our assigned topic &amp; instead talked about all manners of other interesting things, including the nature of human language - one of my favourite topics of late - and Jef Raskin's discovery that  urlLink aeroplane's do not really fly because of the Bernoulli effect . 
After dinner John Smart, the conference organizer, gave us a light talk about accelerating change, which was pretty insightful &amp; I wish I hadn't been so sleepy during it. By the time he was done, around 11pm, I had decided that I was in no shape to face the long trip back home &amp; began thinking of alternatives. Fortunately, I had brought along a change of clothes so I wouldn't have to wear the same outfit the next day. 
  
I sauntered over to a nearby student house, where  urlLink a bunch of Stanford students were chilling on the front porch  & hung out with them for a bit, sipping a beer. After hearing about my plight, they offered to let me crash on a couch in their living room, so I did. They explained the Stanford student housing system to me. Apparently frosh live in dorms &amp; then move out into these student houses for the remainder of their undergrad career. However, the student houses there are massive compared to the ones in Waterloo, often holding as many as 60 people. This was one of the smallest, with a capacity of only 30. As expected, the place was a mess, with  urlLink random junk strewn all over the landing , piles of unused furniture stacked on  urlLink the far side of the main hall  &amp; a  urlLink dining table that wasn't hired for its looks . 
  
The last day of the conference was pleasantly free from technical disruptions. It began with a moving talk about why treating everybody well is good for business &amp; followed that up with a presentation by the founder of a startup pursuing a software replica of the human cortex before the lunch break. 
After lunch, the two interesting events were an introductory talk on nanotech by Christine Peterson of the  urlLink Foresight Institute  &amp; one on social software (like blogs). I had to miss a talk by Tim O'Reilly in order to attend the nanotech one but I did have a chance to meet him briefly after the talk. He's a really friendly guy. Well, unless you happen to work for a company whose legal division is hell bent upon destroying any goodwill that people may have towards them, as a pair of SCO employees found out when they approached him &amp; were met with some vocal vitriol.
  
I made it home in time to get in on my roommate's weekly trip to the grovery store.

I'd been mildly sick with a head cold for the past 3 days so I didn't do much besides work &amp; rest. However, as of this morning I'm back to my usual exhuberant self. I biked in to work again &amp; would have taken some photographs of the scenery but my digicam was out of juice. 
  
My team went out for a lunch buffet at this Indian restaurant called Sue's. OK, so Sue isn't really an authentic-sounding Indian name but neither is Tony. The food was pretty authentic, anyway; some of the best vegetarian food I've ever tasted. 
  
There was a big meeting today so that all the outgoing interns could share their valuable insights with the incoming ones. We planned a few intern activities for the term, shared tips for making the most of the term, compared the previous term with what this one promises to be &amp; generally raised the usual ruckus. 
  
After getting home, I went to the gym with my roommate. There were some random Sun employees playing volleyball outside the gym so, naturally, I joined in &amp; we played until it got dark. Then I went inside &amp; pumped iron until I was exhausted. Quite a busy day.

Frustrated by Suse's refusal to provide an ISO for creating an installation CD, I turned to Debian &amp; spent most of the day installing &amp; configuring it on my PC workstation. The scroll-wheel on my mouse still doesn't work, since it's some obscure brand that Gateway bundles with their systems. But at least I now have Evolution &amp; Mozilla-Firebird :-)
  
I also had lunch with  urlLink Mike Godfrey , a UW CS prof whose sabbatical is being spent working on Jackpot. He's quite a personable guy &amp; one of the few professional computer scientists with perfect vision.

This weekend my roommate made our lives interesting when he accidentally put Tide into the dishwasher. After it had been going for a while, soap suds began to leak all over the kitchen floor. It took several rinses and much scooping of foam before the situation was under control. The dishes are extremely clean now but I would not advise trying this yourself.

Yesterday morning I finally got around to exploring a means of getting to the lab via bike and light-rail, for which Sun has provided me with a monthly pass. It turns out that, despite living in a sleepy residential neighbourhood, there is a major transit station (where 3 systems converge) just up the street from my apartment complex. 
It took me 5 minutes to bike to it. The train stops there every half-hour on weekends, although it will run twice as frequently on weekdays. I boarded the train with my bike &amp; discovered they had a special car for bikes, which was quite heartening.
  
The train took about 25 minutes to arrive at downtown Mountain View, averaging about 90 seconds between stops. 
Apparently it works like the GTA's GO in that passengers do not need to use tickets/tokens to board but random spot checks with the threat of heavy fines are conducted to ensure that the honour system is adhered to. I tried to memorize the station names but after a while they all got muddled in my head. I'm sure they'll work their way into my mindwith time. 
  
Once in downtown MV, there's a 5 minute trip to the start of the trail, which would have been faster if not for traffic lights. Unfortunately, I had only been on the trail for a couple of minutes when there was a construction zone that slowed me down a bit since they ask that bikes be walked through it. That took another couple of minutes to get through. However, the next section of the trail is just a long straight path flanked by dense foliage on the right and industrial wasteland on the left. This took me about 5 minutes to whiz through, as I passed many others enjoying the fresh air on foot, bike or rollerblade. Eventually I hit a fork in the path &amp; had to ask for directions, after which I set off down the left prong. 
  
This final section of the trail winds through some of the most picturesque scenery I've ever seen, ekeing out a path between bodies of shimmering blue water and lush natural vegetation;God's country, as it were. 
Unfortunately, this mesh of paths resulted in me getting lost multiple times before I found the lab. However, the return trip was less confusing by far &amp; allowed me to determine that this leg of the journey constitutes about 10 minutes of biking. 
  
While waiting for the train in downtown MV I wandered around in the annual wine &amp; food festival that was underway. 
Lots of music, cheery people, attractive trinkets &amp; tantalizing food; your garden-variety festival. 
I did come across a booth where CDs containing music of the Andes were being sold and, as usual, I had no money with which to purchase one.

I've finally had an opportunity to meet the people with whom I'm to work this term. Michael, my supervisor, teaches middle-school kids how to juggle. He's also a Mac user. 
Actually, almost everybody on my team uses a TiBook running OS X. The lone Linux user is Tom, my mentor, who is a veritable fountain of fascinating information about Mexican food. 
The other interesting thing I found out is that both James (Gosling) &amp; Michael grew up in rural settings and consequently have plenty of great stories to tell. 
  
I have a SunRay &amp; a Linux box to work on, although I've been having some issues getting RedHat9 to play nice with the PC that is supposed to be a Linux box. Perhaps Suse 8.2 will fare a little better...
The SunRays are kewl because of the way they use a JavaCard to allow roaming sesions. I stick my JavaCard into the SunRay to use it and then take the card with me when I leave. Then I can stick the card into any other SunRay in the lab &amp; my session will pop up onscreen, ready to use. 
  
A few of my coworkers have many plants in their cubicles &amp; one of them was kind enough to lend me a couple of hers to green up my work area. It's always a delight to have rich green foliage to add some life to the artificial indoor environment :-)

I finally moved into my apartment on Labour day. Each bedroom has its own bathroom &amp; the place is fully furnished, including laundry facilities. I had no desk or phone in my room so I called &amp; asked for those. 
My roommate Kirill &amp; I walked around to explore the complex. There are 3 heated swimming pools, none of which are very deep. The gym is not very good though, consisting of nothing but stationary bikes &amp; treadmills. 
We only get a single parking spot but that should not pose a problem, since I don't drive anyway. 
  
The downside is that I live close to the San Jose airport so the sound of an aeroplane either landing or taking off shatters the air every couple of minutes. Fortunately, it hasn't interfered with my sleep. 
The neighbourhood is very much a suburban one, so the only thing with any semblence of civilization nearby is a tiny shopping centre. 
  
The bike I'd requested was already in the apt. when I got there but the tyres needed an air infusion so I biked over to the closest gas station last night. 
There's nothing quite like biking the wrong way on a highway in the dark to get that adrenaline flowing ;-)

I'd been ruminating about jumping on the cellphone bandwagon for a few years now but the one thing that held me back was the lack of an unlimited all-day plan, since I tend to talk a lot. 
Well, there's a company in NorCal called MetroPCS that offers exactly such a plan so I now have a cellphone. It lets me call anywhere in Northern Cali any time of day and talk as much as I want, all for just $35/mo. 
I think I'm allowed to recieve long-distance calls at no extra charge so I'll publish my number here in case anybody needs to get a hold of me: 408-849-9673.

The 1 st  time I was in Sacramento - before I found out that I'd have to return to SF to visit the INS inspection office - I walked over to the Capitol building, where I had an opportunity to watch the state assembly in session. Everybody was walking around &amp; chatting with each other while individual politicians delivered eloquent speeches to them. On the way back I walked through this amazing park filled with trees that had trunks too  wide for me to get my arms around. 
  
The day after I got my I-94, I took the Greyhound back to Sacramento. Even before I got on the bus, I recieved the distinct impression that Greyhound in the US is a somewhat different beast than the one in the great white North. There is no Greyhound stop in Fremont, where my uncle lives, so we drove to the nearest one, which was in the next town. Apparently, Fremont used to have a Greyhound stop but the city forced Greyhound to shut it down because they didn't want people coming there on the Greyhound! 
  
The bus was late so we struck up a conversation with the only other person at the stop, the lone Greyhound employee. Judging from what she told us, it seemed that driving between Fremont &amp; Oakland so as to catch a bus that travelled between Oakland &amp; Sacramento would save a fair bit of time, since there was a long layover at Oakland otherwise. 
My uncle offered to collect me from the Oakland stop when I returned. We were on the verge of driving to Oakland to catch the connecting bus when the bus finally deigned to make an appearence. The ride to Sacramento, layover &amp; all, was fairly uneventful, since I just read through a chunk of Sophie's World en route. 
  
Once I got to Sacramento, I explored the big mall near David's office. The kewlest feature of this mall is a giant sand sculpture depicting The Little Mermaid. A few spots had been disrupted by little birds but it was still a breathtaking sight. I wish my camera hadn't been indisposed at the time :-(
  
Later on, while I was chilling in David's office, the office gardener dropped by to water his plant for him. There was a plant in her little trolley so I asked her about it &amp; she ended up letting me have it to replace the one I was forced to leave behind in Canada. 
  
The next day, Renata &amp; Matt picked me up from David's office in the morning and we went to Renata's friend Juli'ene's house, where her brother let me use his air rifle to take shots at random junk in the backyard. Gotta love those American guns...
Once I had confirmed that I was lousy shot, we drove to a nearby lake to see if the water was warm enough to swim in. It wasn't. Matt didn't think so, however, so we watched him swim in water that was scarcely above 10 degrees. I told him he should move to Canada ;-)
  
Afterwards we went to visit Matt's family, who are a fabulous bunch of people. Well, I only met his mom, brother &amp; parakeet but extrapolating my experiences with them would indicate that his sister &amp; dad must be equally fabulous. 
I didn't take to their dog quite as well but I'm told that nobody ever does. Matt's mom wrote down their phone number for me &amp; said to call them if I ever needed their help while I was here. I was quite bowled over by their friendliness. 
  
The following day David took me to apply for my social security card. Because he needed to pick Jane &amp; Josie up from school - they had just returned from a 5-day camping trip - he left me at the social security office. Unfortunately, I soon realized that I needed to know my phone number &amp; address to apply for the card. Not an unreasonable requirement, except that I had no clue what these were, since I hadn't even seen my apartment yet. Fortunately, I still had the piece of paper with Matt's number on it so I convinced the security guard to let me use the phone marked "not for outside calls" to call the number. I got Matt's mom to look my address up in one of my older posts here and Renata looked my number up on her cell phone. Pretty resourceful, eh?
  
Later that day David's family took me to the state fair. It was a lot like the CNE, although there was a cattle show and an elephant ride. A surprisingly high number of rides required that I be wearing  real  shoes. At the end of the day,  we sat on the golden bears at the park gates. The golden bear is the official mascot of California. We also rejuvenated our tired feet by sitting on these little chairs that massaged feet. The CNE has  got  to get some of those! 
  
After we left the fair, I met up with Renata &amp; Matt for what was supposed to be a LAN party. However, only 5 of us showed up so I ended up having Matt teach me how to play his favourite RTS while we made &amp; ate guacamole, which everybody around here seems to call 'guac'. 
  
The next morning, David dropped me off at the Greyhound stop so I could catch the 12:30 bus to Oakland. We got there at exactly 12:30 but I already had my ticket &amp; the bus driver hadn't boarded yet so I figured everything would be OK. Boy, was I ever wrong! I used my plant to save a seat on the bus &amp; then informed the driver that I wished to place my suitcases in the cargo compartmnt of the bus. He told me that I couldn't get them onto the bus until they had been tagged. Having no clue as to what he was talking about, I inquired as to the nature of this tagging. He explained that I needed to satnd in line at the ticketing counter to have tags put on my baggage before he would consent to stowing it in the cargo compartment. I rushed off to the counter, stood in line for several minutes, got the suitcases tagged &amp; returned to the bus, only to be informed that it was full. Unlike Greyhound Canada, where they will commission another bus if yours fills up, the US Greyhound made me wait over an hour for the next one.
  
When I was finally able to board the bus, I realized that my plant had gone on without me. So I inquired as to its potential whereabouts in Oakland. The dude at the lost'n'found desk actually asked me if it was a  weed  plant! He eventually suggested I check the lost'n'found in SF so I went to SF for the 3rd time. Fortunately, they did have my plant there & were able to return it to me.

Since the O'Reilly OS X conference was being held a mere 10 minute bike ride away from my apartment, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to attend. I used a combination of the student discount as well as the special Sun Mac users discount to get in on the cheap. The first day was essentially a warm-up with no keynotes so I skipped it. Then on  urlLink Tuesday morning , I biked over to the Westin hotel, picked up my registration package and went to the first keynote. On my way into the hall I noticed that several people were using the (presumably) provided wireless access point. 
  
Tim O'Reilly, whom I'd had a chance to meet a few weeks ago at the Accelerating Change conference, had just begun speaking when I walked in. That man is a veritable fountain of ideas! He highlighted several cases where facilities provided in one of the iApps were missing in others that could have made good use of them. After praising Apple for being innovative with their user-centric design, he chided them for not being consistent with the implementation of their ideas. For instance, he remarked that we ought to be able to share our images in iPhoto the way we can share music in iTunes. For a more detailed write-up of his keynote, take a look at  urlLink somebody else's coverage of the keynote . 
  
Tim was followed by David Pogue, who held the audience's attention for the next 45 minutes as he delivered  urlLink a highly entertaining tour of some little-known aspects of Panther . He also confessed that many of the secrets uncovered by his books were actually discovered by a young chap called Adam Goldstein, whom he has now hired. 
  
After Mr. Pogue left the stage, I skipped the rest of the day to take a look at the new digs that my team is moving into at Menlo Park. 
  
Unfortunately, I didn't make very good time getting to the hotel the next morning and Adam Engst had already launched into  urlLink his keynote  by the time I got to the room. He essentially presented a report card, grading the new OS release in several categories. In the end, deemed it worthy of an A-, which was an improvement from the B that Jaguar merited. 
  
When he was done, Adam handed the stage over to Andy Ihnatko, the tech columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. Andy had already foreshadowed his keynote in  urlLink interview  he gave a week or so before the conference. 
 urlLink His keynote  was essentially a walk down memory lane for longtime Mac users, of which I am not one. Nevertheless, he is a very amusing guy and, with the help of a large collection of photographs, he managed to do a fabulous job of keeping the audience in stitches. 
My favourite anecdote was the one about how he once inadvertently had his email address mistaken for an Apple VP, resulting in his being privy to several very interesting &amp; highly confidential information about Apple's activities. 
  
There were 6 sessions that day, organized along different tracks that catered to the various groups of people in attendance. Since most of the work I do can be considered software development, I stuck to the Programming track. 
  
The first session was called  UI design for collaborative multi-user apps . The presenter introduced us to some useful tactic: data can be divided into quantitative (exact numerical values), ordinal (ordered relative to each other) &amp; nominal (used for identification only); Time can be organized by synchronicity &amp; immediacy (think chat VS email); Collaboration can be organized by the author/audience relationship (round-table VS leader/group), number of tasks &amp; scale of collaboration (number of participants); Visual language used by the UI needs to reflect ownership, permissions &amp; latency. 
  
The next session was about  urlLink using Java-based web tech to create desktop user apps . The key idea put forth here was that the browser could be used for the UI &amp; the engine could run as a Java appserver on the client machine instead of having a central server. This strategy leverages the high-powered desktops now prevalent in most computing environments &amp; neatly avoids the issue of network traffic congestion or disconnected portable computers. 
  
I was fortunate enough to run into the creator of iBlog at the beginning of the lunch break &amp; had a pleasant conversation with him about Apple's Cocoa API while we ate lunch. 
  
The session after lunch bore the title  Multi-modal UI design . 
It focused upon the use of handwriting recognition as well as speech synthesis &amp; recognition in OS X. However, the presenter failed to consider the impact of internationalization &amp; localization upon these nascent technologies. 
  
Once this session had concluded, Andy Ihnatko returned for an encore. 
This time he waxed poetic about the merits of AppleScript, which he felt is often given short shrift for not being a  real  development tool. 
He actually compared it to the Ebola virus, talking about how it is extremely simple to start using for basic task automation but scales well to application integration and even all-out software development. 
As proof, he offered his custom weblog system, which started out as glue between the various apps he used to maintain the blog &amp; has now evolved to actually replace much of the functionality heretofore provided by those apps. 
  
The  urlLink next session  began after a short break. It carried the provocative title  Why Mac users hate Java  &amp proceeded to outline some of these reasons. 
Apparently speed is no longer the prime concern; it has been replaced with the feeling that momentum for Java on the desktop has stalled. 
The presenter explored some solutions to this stagnation, most of which revolved around breathing new life into desktop Java by producing innovative desktop apps that take advantage of Java's strengths. 
  
Keeping with the Java theme, the final session of the day was about Java hacks for OS X. The 1st few were simple VM args that enabled some neat Mac-only enhancements to Java apps. These were some more in-depth instructions for overriding the default About box with a custom one &amp; using resource files combined with polymorphism to implement platform-specific keyboard shortcuts for menu items. 
At the end of this session, I spoke to Apple's Java product manager, Rob Fraser, who showed me how to get Ant working with Xcode, which makes my life a lot easier. 
  
Even while I was speaking to Rob,  urlLink the next event  was being set up. The creators of several popular shareware apps for OS X took the stage to entertain questions from the audience. 
I was impressed by just how many lone coders were able to produce such polished apps in so short a time span. From their responses to questions it is clear that almost all of them believe that Cocoa &amp; Objective-C are the best possible development platform out there. 
They were also generally happy with user uptake of their work.
  
The last thing I did that day was to attend an informal discussion with the 2 people currently responsible for the OS X port of OpenOffice.org, the largest open source program in existence. 
They talked about how they had recently managed to substitute the X11 dependencies of OpenOffice.org on the Mac with Java instead, which is good news in the short term as Java has astonishingly good support on OS X. 
Near the end of their discussion, somebody even showed up with free beer for all takers!
  
 urlLink The 1st keynote of the last day  was basically all about Apple's forays into the scientific computing market, spurred by the popularity of the G5's low price/performance ration. Much ballyhooing was made of all the scientific visualization tools available for OS X.
  
The last part of the conference that I attended was the keynote by a computer scientist turned biologist working at the Rockefeller Institute in San Diego. 
Her talk was completely devoid of the OS X cheerleading that had marked the rest of the conference but heavy on biological jargon. 
She ran through  urlLink an introduction to bioinformatics with a specific focus on gene sequencing . 
Among her revelations was the fact that the quantity of data being uncovered was actually managing to outpace the growth in CPU horsepower! 
She cautioned, however, that accuracy is more important than raw speed when making predictions in this field because a bad guess could waste upto a year of valuable research time. 
I found myself struggling to recall the relationships between genetics terms that I used to be familiar with a few scant years hence so I vowed to brush up on them. 
  
On my way out, I ran into the creator of  urlLink F-script , a SmallTalk-derived language for accessing &amp; manipulating Cocoa objects. 
We spoke briefly &amp; he handed me a paper about adding support for array-based language features to regular object-oriented languages.

On our way home from work today, some guy in a minivan got pretty enraged - we're not sure why - and gave us the one-finger salute several times. Kirill rolled down the window &amp; fired an appropriately worded threat in the guy's direction but he proved incapable of responding with anything more than the verbal equivalent of his previously displayed gesture. 
  
During our weekly groceery trip on the way back from the gym, the cash register crashed while the clerk was weighing some of the produce I'd picked up. 
It was the 1st time I've ever seen a cash register rebooted. The device had a Phoenix BIOS so I guess it was powered by an x86 CPU, although it booted off the network &amp; didn't run any OS I recognized.

Kirill &amp; I returned the Alera yesterday afternoon. In its stead we now have a Mitsubishi Diamante, which he describes as a Japanese Mercedes. It has a sun-roof &amp; heated leather seats, among other things. We took it for a spin &amp; have decided that it is much nicer than the Alera. 
  
While we were at Hertz, however, we found out that they had been charging Sun $5.50/day for property theft insurance that Kirill had not asked for &amp; was quite unaware of. Considering that we never leave anything remotely valuable in the car, this was basically about $300 down the tube because the Hertz employee that gave Kirill the car in SFO had pulled a sneaky trick.

For lunch yesterday Mike [Godfrey] &amp; I went to the most interesting sushi place I've ever seen. They used brown rice instead of the usual white kind. Brown has a much stronger taste than white rice does so it seems almost unnecessary to use Soy sauce with it. They also use white pickled ginger instead of the usual pink variety. The miso soup was some of the best we'd had too. 
  
The other kewl thing that happened yesterday was that my  'free'  copy of 
 urlLink Panther  showed up. 
I opted to simply upgrade my existing system, which seems to have gone well :-)

 urlLink Adam Spitz , with whom I used to work at Checkfree back in 2nd year, has been hired by Sun Labs as a full time employee. He stayed with  Kirill  &amp; me for a couple of days until he was able to move into a place of his own. Adam is a big fan of a Smalltalk variant called Squeak so he told me all about it &amp; showed me some kewl stuff that it can be done with it. I tried to run it on  hermod  but it simply refused to start, much to Adam's bewilderment. It's too bad because the Squeak workspace seemed really fascinating.

As I mentioned last Wednesday, the Computer History Museum held its 2003 Fellow Awards Celebration last night &amp; Sun sent 10 people, including me, to attend  the shindig. The 1st thing that happened when we got in was that we were offered a glass of champagne each. Not a bad start to the evening, eh. There is a room that houses the machines brought out of storage; about a tenth of the total artifacts possessed by the museum. I walked in and began to walk backwards through the chronologically arranges displays. I stopped for a few moments to pay homage to the ZX Spectrum, the machine on which I wrote my 1st lines of code at the age of 4. The next thing I discovered was the original teacup from Utah that has now become the most widely used model in 3D graphics programming. Beside it was a prototype of the very 1st VR headset, designed by Ivan Sutherland who works at the lab with me. Further on, there were some extremely large supercomputers &amp; mainframes. I was amazed to notice that these beasts actually had a physical button for each instruction that could be executed. Eventually my hunger pangs won out &amp; I decided to hit the buffet. 
  
While I availed myself of the scrumptious food laid out for our consumption, I chatted with a random guy from Google. He kept going on about the free food that Google gives its employees. When I asked him about the troubles his company was having with PageRank, he assured me that it was still being used &amp; that he had not heard of any plans to retire it. I also spotted David Filo, the founder of Yahoo. Unfortunately, he was being monopolized by some other people already so I didn't have an opportunity to say hi. Oh, well; his loss. A while later I ran into my supervisor, who was being hounded by a reporter so I lent him moral support for a while until he managed to extricate himself from the situation. 
  
When it was time for the ceremonies to begin, I headed upstairs &amp; into the auditorium. But just before I entered, I spotted Tim Berners-Lee standing outside so I siezed the opportunity to say hi to him &amp; personally thank him for his dogged work ensuring that the world wide web he invented didn't get destroyed by a babel of competing proprietary standards. He replied that there was still much work to be done, which puzzled me a little but I didn't want to straggle too long so I found the Sun reserved seating &amp; took up a spot beside my supervisor, who pointed Doug Engelbart, inventor of the mouse, out to me as the man walked by us. 
  
The ceremony kicked off with a comedian/magician type guy who provided some light entertainment before the 1st luminary, Gordon Bell, was called up on stage to receive his award &amp; say a few words. He was followed by Tim Berners-Lee &amp; then David Wheeler. They all regaled us with a few interesting stories from the past before stepping offstage. After the hoopla was over, we streamed out of the auditorium &amp; went home.
  
The next evening I returned to the museum to hear Tim Berners-Lee give a talk. He spoke about his ongoing work to convince people that they should move away from visually marked-up content directed at humans and towards semantically marked-up content targeted at both people &amp; machines instead. During his speech, he delved into several amusing anecdotes about the history of the Web. The most surprising aspect of the entire presentation was that he seems to use Safari as his web browser of choice! Now, while I like the UI in Safari myself, I have to come down hard on it for failing to fully support key Web standards like HTML 4 &amp; CSS2. Naturally, the fact that the man who has devoted his life to promoting these standards should use Safari was more than a little perplexing.

I just spent the entire day reading about recent discoveries that have prompted  urlLink an overhaul of the prevailing theory about ancient Indian civilization . It's amazing how much psychological damage the British empire inflicted upon Indian culture in only 3 centuries! 
Speaking of India, I ate half of my papaya today. It was quite good, although I was rather surprised at the lack of seeds within it.

Today I helped Jeanie, one of the lab support staff, bring some decorative pumpkins back from 
 urlLink a nearby pumpkin patch . 
There were  urlLink giant bundles of corn stalks  all over the place to attract passers by. There was also this  urlLink pumpkin throne  that had a giant pumpkin as the seat back. After wandering around the place for a while, we found 6 that we liked. She was kind enough to get me a papaya while we were there. It's been years since I've tasted papaya so I'm eagerly looking forward to eating it. After leaving the pumpkin patch, we stopped at a nearby saloon for lunch. The saloon was this little rustic place with  urlLink wood tables that had been engraved  so many times that they make for a splendid sight now.

Today, I decided to see if there were any wireless networks accessible from my apartment. Lo &amp; behold, I found a whole bunch! It seems everybody is jumping on the wireless LAN bandwagon these days. Curious, I tried each one &amp; found 2 that had been left wide open. Consequently, I am now able to connect to the Net 
by piggybacking on either of these 2. No more being tethered to a 7 foot ethernet cable :-)
  
I also qualified to be one of the 10 Sun Microsystems employees attending the Computer History Museum's 
 urlLink 2003 Fellow Awards Celebration  next Tuesday.

As of yesterday, I have managed to make the transition from doing all my development on the Linux box in my cubicle to doing it on my Powerbook instead. This is very convenient, as it allows me to work, not just from home, but from just about anywhere I am. 
Of course, since  urlLink Xcode , Apple's revolutionary new IDE, is not available for a few more weeks, I'm still stuck using the old Project Builder for the next little while.

Last night I went through a car wash for the 1st time in my life. Yeah, I'm sure that doesn't sound the least bit exciting to anybody else but it was quite the novelty for me. Then today I went to a pumpkin patch for the 1st time ever. On a different note, I figured out how to work around the problem with the latch on my powerbook, thanks to a tip from my brother. And, after finishing  The Prisoner of Azkaban , I now understand why everybody simply  had  to start reading the next book.

After about five &amp; a half months of not having a computer of my own, I'm now in possession of  urlLink a new 15 inch Aluminium G4 Powerbook  with a DVD burner. 
There was a wee spot of trouble with the delivery when the delivery guy went to the wrong address, despite having the correct one on the package, but it eventually made its way to me in  urlLink a nice black box . I named it Hermod, after the Norse messenger of the gods. So far it has been highly satisfactory, aside from a minor problem with the latch that keeps the lid shut when it is closed. 
  
As most of the world probably knows by now, California has elected a new governor. 
He wasn't  urlLink my 1st choice  but I can live with it.

After the bash, my roommate dropped me off at the ACE station, where I had planned to catch a bus to Stockton, from which I could transfer to a train that would take me all the way to downtown Sacramento. So, the 1st thing I did was to pull a Tony. 
  
I boarded the bus &amp; told the driver that I wished to purchase a ticket. It turned out that he had been assigned to this route at the umpteenth nanosecond &amp; had no idea how that was supposed to work. I began to calmly explain to him, in excruciating detail, how I had been told by the good folks at Amtrak that I would be able to procure a ticket from the bus driver. About three &amp; a half seconds into my story, he succumbed &amp; told me I could have a free ride. 
  
The rest of the trip proceeded as anticipated, with me finishing  Barbarians Led by Bill Gates  en route &amp; I was picked up at the Amtrak by David,  urlLink Jane, Josie &amp; Mikey . They were still recovering from jet lag after a 2 week vacation in Brampton but stayed up until the wee hours of the morning chatting with me. 
  
The next morning they took me to a nice Thai restaurant in downtown Sacramento for lunch. When we were done eating, we went to a nearby arts show. Not being an art show veteran, I wasn't quite sure what to expect but, had I any expectations, they would have been more than met. 
  
The show was a melange of artists displaying (and hoping to sell) their work, which ranged in price from 2 to 4 digits. One of the 1st items that captured my fancy was  urlLink a soapstone sculpture of a very dog-like bear , whose carefully chiseled face was graced by a forlorn smile begging onlookers to rescue him from this life of endless public scrutiny. 
  
Next to captivate me was a series of "spirit shadow" photographs. These were taken at night using a long-exposure camera. The artist had walked around in the scene being captured &amp; used a bright lamp to cast his shadow on the scene as it was being recorded onto the film. This had the effect of producing photographs with these bodiless humanoid shadows in them. His most prized shot was one depicting the stonehenge with crouching shadowy figured cast onto each visible stone. Apparently he had received special permission from the British gov't to skulk around this anthropological treasure. 
  
By far the most amusing (not to mention thought-provoking) piece of work I came across was a graphite sketch bearing the title "Spirit of mount Rushmore". It featured the well-known landmark but with the faces of the 5 presidents replaced by faces of the 5 native tribal leaders decked out in full regalia. I was so taken by it that I made a point of expressing my awe to the artist. 
  
I spent much of the remainder of my stay playing with Mikey, watching Josie sketch manga (both her mother &amp; paternal grandmother were gifted visual artists &amp; she's keeping up the good work) &amp; having highly animated discussions with David &amp; Jane. 
  
On Sunday evening, they were kind enough to drop me back at my apartment. I gave them a tour of the place &amp; introduced them to my roommate.

James took our 6-person team out for dim-sum today. The official purpose of the lunch meeting was to discuss the potential for a promising new application for the technology we've been working on. Of course, as is wont to happen when a bunch of long-time computer programmers (and one curious intern) get together informally, there was also much narration of computery anecdotes. The food was good but the stories blew them away  8-)
  
...and - oh yeah -  good riddance to the Tories  :->

Today I went on a tour of the Sun manufacturing facilities in Newark. They made us wear special smocks &amp; put anti-static straps on our shoes before we could enter the factory. The guide led us around the floor, pointing out the various machines &amp; explaining their purposes. Apparently, ever since the rolling brownouts 2 years ago, the factory has had backup power generation for all critical systems. 
  
In other news, the 15-inch Powerbook I ordered last week has finally shipped :-)

Who says grad students don't know how to have fun? I was at a random grad student party on the Stanford campus last night &amp; they sure knew how to have a good time. The 1st thing I learned was that karaoke is a lot harder than some people make it look. The 2nd thing I learned was that it helps if you know the song  really  well. It also helps to sing with a bunch of other people &amp; use a song with an energetic chorus that falls comfortably within your vocal range. 
  
Although I got a ride home from some random people I met there, I had to take the CalTrain from Mountain View to Palo Alto (3 stops) on my way there. Having never taken CalTrain before, I wasn't sure what to expect but it was quite a nice experience. The only downside to the night is that my bike is now at the closest VTA stop, which is a 5 minute bike ride away. I guess I'll have to go for a walk at some point today...

I finally managed to sneak into a class at San Jose State today. It was a graduate level class on cryptography &amp; quantum cryptography was being introduced. The prof started out by going over the differences between classical &amp; quantum physics, then proceeded to explain the math used to describe quantum mechanics. 
I noticed that I seemed to be one of the very few people in the class that was following along; the rest looked hopelessly lost. I suspect that my strong Math background courtsey of UW helped a lot as there was a considerable amount of linear algebra involved. 
  
I was impressed by how clearly the prof was able to explain the concepts behind quantum cryptography - yes, he used Alice, Bob &amp; Eve - once he had gone through the required quantum mechanics preamble. I certainly learned a lot in this class, especially about polarized light.

Sarah Chang entered the stage to much applause, sporting a pink conservative 1-piece, and took up her spot amidst the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. She played  urlLink Shostakovich 's  urlLink opus number 77 , which has four parts. The first part was a rather melancholy, slow piece that I wasn't particularly fond of, despite having been starved for live orchestral music since last summer. However, the second one livened up considerably. It filled my head with visions of large goofy creatures; multitudes of them hopping around. The third part started out like a military marching song but soon dropped to a slower pace, not unlike the first. I found it rather inconsistent, which ruined whatever effect it was meant to have. Fortunately, the fourth part was much more to my liking. It conjured up images of friends being gathered together from disparate areas and assembled into a force that kept advancing on an incumbent enemy that slowly gave way, one skirmish at a time, in the face of an inevitable restoration of a once vanquished power to its former glory.

What a weekend! My uncle turned 50 on the 3rd so there was a party for him on the weekend. His (and my mom's) cousin, Raynah, cooked dinner. She's an amazing cook so the food was absolutely smashing. She actually made marzipan from scratch by hand! Among the guests was the novelist  urlLink Vance Bourjaily , who told me the story of how he started out as a writer. He also recited the poem that he'd used to win his wife's heart. 
  
Although the party had ended by 1:30, we didn't get to bed until 3am. The next day was spent listening to Raynah regale us with stories of her colourful globetrotting life.

After about 10 weeks of being away from it, I'd actually started to miss campus life a bit. Fortunately, I have a neat way of dealing with it: I take the light rail over to the nearby San Jose State University campus, plug hermod into one of the ethernet jacks at the library &amp; work there. 
It's an interesting change from working in my cube, since there are a ton of students milling around at the library. 
  
Of course, I still need to check my Sun email, so I don't head over to the campus until after lunch. Instead, I work in a flexible workspace at Sun's Santa Clara HQ, which is right around the corner from my apt. This way I can eat at the awesome cafeteria there and catch a game of pickup volleyball just before lunch.

As a result of  urlLink some organizational changes , my team has moved to a different building and I'm being allowed to work from home since none of them will be around at the lab anyway. 
On Friday I tried working from home for the 1st time. It has its pros &amp; cons: while I saved some time by not commuting, could play music all day as I worked &amp; was able to hit the fridge for snacks when I felt hungry, there was nobody to eat lunch with.

Well, the adventure has come to an end; I completed my research a few days ago. My supervisor was extremely pleased with my work. On Friday, we had the last bash of the year to toast the departure of the Fall interns. I was up until 2am packing but was able to board my flight with no major hiccups. 
  
I guess it's only appropriate to make a few closing comments about my experience working in Silicon Valley. The biggest difference for me was the complete dependence upon cars; If I am able to return, I've decided to take up driving. I also found most of the Canadian myths about the pushy ignorant Americans to be rather exaggerated; they're not as different from us as we'd like to believe; well, at least not in Northern California. It must have something to do with that fact that the ethnic diversity in The Valley (and ,to a lesser extent, the entire state) is very high.

Kirill &amp; I had something of an adventure today. We drove to a clothing store somewhere in Sunnyvale so he could pick up a jacket but got lost upon leaving the store and ended up driving around aimlessly in some very hilly areas with lots of sharp cuurves in the roads. Eventually we found our way to downtown Palo Alto and decided to have dinner at the same place I'd had lunch at yesterday. 
  
Interestingly enough, there was a belly-dancer competition going on there when we arrived! Unfortunately, we got a table with nary a view of the whirling forms. The music was pretty decent though. After dinner we went to Fry's so I could pick up this dirt cheap 802.11g wireless router that had been advertised in yesterday's paper. However, it turned out to be an error on the part of the newspaper and I had to spend a little more than I had been expecting, although the router is still pretty cheap for what it offers. 
  
I've configured it and it works, although it turns out I can get a better signal from somebody else's open WLAN in my bedroom!

Renata had been saying all term that she, Matt &amp; Forrest would take a road trip to visit me in Santa Clara. Since this weekend was their last shot at doing so, they finally made it over. They didn't have any trouble getting to my place, although Forrest seemed to be completely exhausted from the previous day. 
  
After giving him a little while to rest, we went to visit Matt's brother Jason at Stanford. He showed s around his dorm &amp; then we went off-campus for lunch. Before eating, we spent some time poking around the UN store, which reminded me of 10,000 Villages. Jason treated us to lunch at this Mediterranean wrap restaurant, which was quite good. We ran across a bubble-tea place so I insisted upon going in, since it had been months since my last one. 
  
There are an impressively high number of indie cinemas around campus but we didn't really want to spent 2-3 hours watching a movie when we could be enjoying the sun instead. While we were finishing off our desserts, I spotted a fellow Sun intern, Ryan Singer, who was wandering around town in an attempt to avoid writing an essay. I introduced him to the Sacramentonians before we decided to drop Jason back, since he had an exam for which he needed to study. 
  
After depositing Jason in his dorm, we went to the Stanford Art museum, which had a most impressive collection of sculptures. I especially liked  urlLink Rodin's  The Gates of Hell  , which is the most awe-inspiring piece of sculpture I have ever set eyes upon. Another interesting thing we saw was the Stone River, constructed out of hundreds of rocks formed into a curvy wall inside a long pit. 
  
By this point it had started to get dark so we soon left, stopping to rent  Bruce Almighty  en route to my apartment. Renata &amp; Matt made jalapeno poppers, which were terrific but very spicy. Fortunately, I had enough eggnog to deal with that :-)
  
I gave Renata my plant to take home, since I won't be here too much longer &amp; she promised to continue the excellent job I'd been doing nursing it back to health.

Down here, most people seem to get 2 days off to fondly recall that touching moment in North American history when friendly natives taught starving European explorers how to live off the land so that the grateful explorers would be able to eventually repay the favour by slaughtering virtually the entire native population and annexing their land. Because these 2 holidays conveniently make for a very long weekend, I had plans to visit my cousin David's family once last time before I returned to the Great White North. I took an Amtrak train to Sacramento on Wednesday and was picked up by David, Jane, Josie &amp; Mikey. 
  
After taking the minivan through a car-wash, all of us went to Jane's sister's place for Thanksgiving lunch on Thursday, where I demonstrated my prowess on the trampoline in their back yard. All present were suitably impressed, even after I divulged that had taken lessons last summer. Renata &amp; I made plans to hang out with some of her friends on Saturday. Once we had supped, several of us went for a walk in the local park before David &amp; Jane took Josie, Mikey, me &amp; 2 other cousins back home. 
  
After being subjected to much Disney propaganda on TV, we convinced Josie to play some board games with us. She had a chess set so I taught her how to play chess, Tony-style; all the pieces talk and have their own distinct personailities (except the pawns, who are like agent Smith from The Matrix). She seemed to enjoy the game a lot, even though I was ruthlessly crushing her. The game was made even more interesting by Mikey, who kept trying to snatch pieces off the board.
  
Friday was spent playing with Mikey &amp; Josie, discussing various social issues with Jane &amp; listening to David tell stories of the family from days gone by. I also taught David & Josie to play hangman, although they didn't seem to taken by it. Jane needed to get some work done on her car so we went out for lunch while it was being fixed up. There had been plans to visit lake Tahoe but the threat of rain skittled those. 
  
On Saturday we went to Jane's sister Ruth's place for a photo shoot by her son Ricardo, who's a budding photographer. Among many others, he took some pictures of me with Renata, David, Mikey &amp; Josie. After lunch, Renata &amp; I headed off to her place, which makes the Geekhaus look clean by comparision. However, they did have a wireless LAN, which I made good use of. Renata, Matt, Dan &amp; I went briefly explored a nearby botanical garden &amp; watched a few episodes of the Animatrix before heading off to her friends' place for the night. 
  
Once there, we sat around talking for a while before playing Balderdash, followed by a rowdy game that combined Charades, Pictionary, wordplay &amp; Trivial Pursuit. Eventually we had to leave, although we did stop to check up on somebody's dog en route to Renata's place. This dog had, in addition to it's own room, it's own water-filtration system! Instead of going to sleep as we had plannned, we ended up having a late-night discussion about theoretical Physics. 
  
Jane took Josie, Mikey &amp; me out for dinner on Sunday, while David did some work at home. The next morning I went in to work with David &amp; walked to the train station from there. No sooner had I made it to the station than it began raining. Fortunately, the rain had stopped by the time I got to Santa Clara.

Alex has been hankering for me to meet Kris, an old friend of his, for a couple of years now. He finally got around to having us both over simultaneously. It was tricky to schedule because I was already involved in several plans that accounted for much of my vacation and Kris had to work a lot. However, Alex did eventually manage to find an evening that would be convenient for both of us. As he was staying with Sarah's mom on that day, we agreed to hang out in Guelph. 
  
I told him I'd catch a bus that would get me to Guelph around noon. This bus was scheduled to leave TO at 10:30. It was almost 10:10 by the time I got out of the building. I knew it would be tight but decided not to try using the subway as an expedient since it wasn't a long enough walk to be worth the setup time of actually boarding a subway train. By the time I got to the Greyhound station, there were only 5 minutes left for the bus to depart and it was already in the station so I couldn't count on a delay.
  
The queue at the ticketing booth did not inspire much confidence either. My first attempt to work around the system failed because the express cash-only booth at the other end of the station was closed. Realizing that I wasn't going to make the bus without resorting to drastic measures, I fell back to my trump card; using all the Jedi mind-control skills I could muster that instant, I convinced each person in the queue to let me ahead of them. I didn't want to deal with the extra minute required to process a credit transaction so I paid or the ticket in cash, thereby obliterating the tiny amount of Canadian currency I possessed. 
  
I boarded the bus less than a minute before it pulled out of the station. The trip itself was uneventful, although I did arrive in Guelph 10 minutes ahead of schedule. Alex and Sarah were late getting there but I killed time by reading while I waited for them. They actually showed up in Sarah's mom's 19-year-old hippie van, which is more an adventure than a form of transportation. 
  
Sarah's mom is currently in the throes of moving to a new house so we helped her move some boxes into the van and she gave us the grand tour of the new place, which is a warren of little rooms, most of which have lovely hardwood floors. Alex, Sarah and I ate lunch at a little place in downtown Guelph, where they took longer to prepare my food than it took me to eat it; and anybody whose watched me eat a social meal can appreciate quite how tardy the service was. 
  
After hanging out at the house for a bit, Alex and I took Sarah's doggie for a walk. He let me hold the leash until my hand got cold. It was the first time I've ever walked a dog. Kris had shown up by the time we returned so he, Alex and I went out for Pizza. Kris is an entertaining guy. We hung out a bit longer once back at the house, although Kris had to leave shortly so I showed my 3D game to Alex, who played it for longer than I've ever seen anybody else do, giving me a few suggestions for improvement in the process. 
  
When everybody else showed up again, Sarah produced the DVD for "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days", which we watched before going to bed. I didn't get much sleep because the heating system kept starting and stopping all night. Oddly enough, however, I wasn't sleepy in the morning. Plus Sarah's mom was nice enough to lend us the car for a while so Alex and Sarah could drop me off directly at Michelle's place in Oakville, since I was supposed to meet up with her that afternoon.

On Friday morning I took the Metro to Alex's house. When I attempted to board the bus on the South shore, however, my transfer was met with a vitriolic stream of French. After a few unsuccessful attempts at explaining that I did not understand French, one of the other passengers translated for me. Appparently I needed to buy another fare in order to travel on the South shore; fair enough, although I think this episode caused the driver to take an instant dislike to me. I asked him to let me off at St. Charles, which is where Alex lives. Instead he let me off a block  before  St. Charles and told me it was a couple of blocks behind us. If I hadn't beeen lost in that area only a couple of days ago, I would have wasted a good deal of time wandering around aimlessly. 
  
I had an enjoyable time talking to  urlLink Izzy & Alex  for a few hours before we left for a soiree at Alex's friend Jacob's studio apartment on the island. Jacob's apt. is a very colourful place, with all manners of interesting artifacts on the walls. I met a bunch of fascinating Montrealers there and  urlLink played with this kewl sword I found  :-) It was during that time that I decided Montreal was definately more fun than TO. 
  
The night before I left, Alex, Izzy & I went out for dinner at this neat little Sushi buffet on the South shore. The proprietor explained to me the significance of that ceramic cat that seems to grace so many Asian restaurants. Apparently it is a symbol of good fortune, with each of its paws representing health & wealth, respectively.

When   urlLink 
 
  urlLink  Shade    used to tell me stories about his time at Dawson, referring to it as "the largest English CEGEP in the world", I never quite grasped the enormity of the phrase; until yesterday that is, when I went to Dawson to meet Alex Somma, who teaches a media course at  urlLink New School . There are over 8000 students in attendance at this one colossal building in downtown Montreal.  urlLink Alex has a radio show at Dawson  so I got to be his guest. We made up fake news stories to amuse ourselves, since I don't think many people actually listen to the school radio. 
 
Later that day   urlLink 
 
  urlLink  Shade    took me to an amazing restaurant called Santropol for  urlLink dinner . His sandwich had this delicious hot pepper jelly in it so I picked up a wee bottle of the stuff to bring back to this bland Anglophone province for use with SpucChuck. On our way back, I took a picture of  urlLink this crazy street that had 1-way signs pointing in both directions ! When we got to his place,   urlLink 
 
  urlLink  Finn    was over so I had an engaging & entertaining conversation with them & their mother, lubricated by a lot of wine.

Kerriann took Prish, Sue, Steph and me to a club in Kingston last night. It was retro night so the music was all very 80s. Kerriann seems to know about half the patrons of the club so she kept darting off to go talk to different friends that had just showed up. 
 
We went skating on the canal in Ottawa today afternoon. The only other time I'd been skating was a few years ago. Steph pulled me around for the first little while, which was fun but rather passive and strained my back. Then Sue tried supporting me as I attempted to propel myself but that didn't work too well as I only had support on one side. So I tried again with with Prish & Sue each holding one of my hands, which worked somewhat better; enough to get me to the point where I could try skating on my own. I had a lot of trouble with my balance, although by the end I was able to skate in short bursts, albeit in a rather crude manner. It was a very tiring experience for me, since I was putting enormous effort into moving forward while staying on my feet. 
 
The drive into Montreal was fairly straightforward, although we got lost after missing a turnoff just a few blocks from Alex Somma's house on the South shore. I got directions from some random Francophones in a gas station dep and we eventually made it to Somma's place, only to discover that he wasn't home! Prish & Sue were tired & hungry by this point so I tracked Jer down instead & arranged to hang out with him instead. Then we went to  urlLink the hostel where Prish & Sue are staying  to check them in, followed by a hearty dinner - I had bifteck - at Nickels, which has fantastic broccoli. 
 
Once we'd eaten, the girls dropped me off at the apt. where Jer's friends Chris & Esther live. Two other friends,  urlLink Julie & Jaime  were there too. It was absolutely wonderful to meet some of the people about whom I have heard Jer tell stories. I discovered that Julie knows Alex Somma, Andrew Jones & Shannon Headland from high school! It was a lot of fun hanging out with them, although we could only stay so long as Jer needed to be up at 6am in the morning.

Well, I'm back in the centre of the universe for an indeterminate amount of time now. I spent most of yesterday at Wonderland with Don, Magic, Keith &amp; Ed. Cat, Sue & 3 of Cat's friends were there too but they split up from us at lunch so we only went on a couple of rides with them. Keith was late so Don, Magic &amp; I pelted him with pine cones. Since it was opening day, several of the rides broke down while we were in line, although they were fixed within minutes, except for Top Gun, on which Keith &amp; I got stuck for about 15 minutes! At the end of the day, we tried on various random hats &amp; ate overpriced  (but delicious) funnel cakes.

Since Ange was going to Montreal this weekend, I figured it would be a great opportunity to visit my friends in Montreal (and possibly Ottawa). Ange &amp; a co-worker picked me up at Yorkdale on Friday afternoon &amp; we drove to the West island nonstop, eating a picnic lunch in the car. Then Ange &amp; I took the Metro to 
 urlLink 
 
  urlLink 
 Shade  's place, where we were treated to a delicious home-cooked meal while he &amp; his mom entertained us with verbal banter. 
  
After supper, Shade,  urlLink 
 
  urlLink 
 Finn  , Shade's friend Stu and I watched Shrek 2, which was loaded with the expected Disney jokes. 
We then proceeded to Brutopia, where we ran into Ange! Stellar company & good drinks made for a thoroughly enjoyable night until the bar closed &amp; we returned to Stu's place where we crashed. 
  
On Saturday Shade taught me how to play  urlLink Magic  &amp; then I played a couple of games with him &amp; Stu. After that I took a break from Magic &amp; let Shade &amp; Stu play each other once before I rejoined the fray. That game ended up being a marathon that went on for hours, thanks to me drawing &amp; playing three cards that slowed down the pace by an order of magnitude (meekstones, for anybody who plays). We were supposed to have dinner with Fabienne &amp; Frank that evening so I eventually conceded the game since Shade showed no signs of leaving before it was over. 
  
After a brief stopover at Shade's place (where I had an opportunity to meet Finn's new Powerbook, Gwen), we went over to Fabienne &amp; Frank's place in downtown Montreal, where two of Fab's friends from France were visiting. It turned out that I was the only one who didn't speak French, although one of her friends spoke English very haltingly. Nevertheless, with three virtually bilingual people around, translations were not hard to come by. One interesting observation I made was that Fab now runs Linux (localized in French) on her laptop. 
  
We quickly reached a unanimous decision about the dinner venue for the night: this vegetarian French restaurant with a twist; there's no menu; instead they tell you what you will be eating and you decide how much you want; if you can't finish your meal, there's a $2 fine that goes to charity &amp; you are denied dessert; if you don't finish dessert after opting to have some, you are banned from the restaurant. Their strange methodology seems to be working, considering that all six of us had heard of the place, although none of us knew anybody who had eaten there! The food was fantastic and there's a student discount on the main course so it only costs $10. The dessert is overkill, although we all tried it anyway just to have the complete experience. 
  
Having finished the fifth Harry Potter book, I am now reading  The Life of Pi . I happened to mention this to Shade at one point on Sunday morning, only to learn that his mother actually knows the author! Apparently she volunteered with him at  hospital for a while. When the book was published, she invited him to speak at her book club. He agreed and then went on to win the Booker award mere weeks later. The members of her book club must have been thrilled. 
  
I spent the afternoon at Fab & Frank's place. While there, I played the famous  I am Canadian  rant for Fab, who had never heard of it before. I also played for her the  I am not Canadian  spoof, which parodies the Quebecois. Apparently neither of them are quite as funny to people who aren't from Ontario...
  
Steph had come to Montreal too so I met up with her &amp; Shade before returning to his place for dinner. As expected, the conversation was all over the place, although it never ceased to be interesting or entertaining. At one point we were talking about the advantages of LEDs over traditional light sources and Shade's mom gifted me with a nifty wand powered by a blue LED. It has four settings for the speed at which it can flash: off, slow pulses, epilepsy &amp; steady glow. 
  
Today was a very rainy day so we didn't really feel like going outside too much after a brief excursion to get bagels. The bagels were scrumptious though. Fresh Montreal bagels are one of life's simple pleasures. 
  
While pottering around the house, I discovered this fascinating wooden musical instrument called a  tamboa , which is a wooden box whose top consists of six cantilevered fingers (three on each side) of different lengths such that the tips of each opposing pair are the same miniscule distance from each other. It can produce the most wonderful sounds &amp; I sat around for a while playing with it.
  
The last thing we did before Ange picked Steph &amp; me up was to play a board game called  Abalone , which is vaguely similar to Draughts or Go (in that is has two differently coloured sets of identically shaped pieces) but played on a hexagonal board like Chinese Checkers. It's a neat game &amp; I'd be interested in playing it again.

My friends Rich and Deb are getting married next weekend. Since Deb has only three female friends, one of whom is in Europe right now, Carol (her sister/maid of honour) decided to throw them a combined bachelor party. The plan was to meet up at Deb's parent's place in Flamborough and then drive to Niagara Falls for a night of revelry. She asked me to take the GO to Burlington, where she would pick me up. It seemed easy enough, except that I'm not familiar with the GO at all and have certainly never taken it to Burlington before. 
 
While I was on the train to Oakville, I was staring at my ticket and realized that they need to be cancelled (whatever that meant)  before  boarding the train. I hadn't cancelled the tickets I'd used for my prior two train trips on the GO so it was probably lucky that nobody had performed a ticket check either time. However, I did get this ticket cancelled upon boarding the bus to Hamilton at Oakville. Now, the Burlington stop is the first one on that route. However, thanks to an inexplicable chain of illogic, I somehow began to think that I was supposed to meet Carol at Hamilton and so took it all the way there. 
 
Naturally, nobody was waiting for me at the station. After waiting around for a while, I called Deb's place. They had sent out a pair of search parties to look for me at various GO stations between Burlington and Toronto! It hadn't occurred to them that I might have slipped under their very noses at Burlington. The worst part is that Carol almost got onto the bus at Burlington to see if I was on it when I never stepped off it. If only they had, we would have avoided a two hour delay. Oh well. 
 
The first thing we did in Niagara-on-the-lake was to eat dinner at one of the many restaurants there. Most of them had people standing outside beckoning passers-by to eat there. One place even handed us a menu with the encouraging words,  the prices are in Canadian dollars.   I should bloody hope so, given that they're conducting business on Canadian soil!  
I ordered a medium-rare 7 oz bison steak since I'd never had bison before. It tasted similar to beef, although I could distinguish between the two by taste. During conversation, it came to light that Rich'n'Deb do have a gift registry&mdash;they simply hadn't thought to tell most people about it! Rich lived up to his reputation be polishing off a 20 oz porterhouse steak and then eating half of Deb's meal too. 
 
After dinner we split up and some of us went to look at the falls. The last time I saw the falls was seven years ago. They haven't changed much. I did, however, discover that what I previously thought was a permanent rainbow is actually faked using powerful strobe lights that project a rainbow onto the great mass of swirling mist that hangs above the falls. That mist is very thick; thick enough to fog up my glasses as we walked through it. We saw some people attempting to shield themselves from the mist with a  urlLink brolly . Apparently it hadn't occurred to them that this would be ineffective against water that was hanging in the air as they walked through it rather than falling down from above. 
 
Once we were tired of gazing into the never-ending torrent of water and our clothes had begun to turn uncomfortably damp, we headed into the casino. None of us had ever been into a casino before so we were expecting something out of the heist movies. Reality was somewhat disappointing. There were people smoking everywhere when we entered, which was rather disgusting until we found out that there was non-smoking floor lurking beneath the main one. Deb and I wandered around watching people gamble as we kept an eye out for the others. The tables were actually rather boring. People were winning and losing hundreds of dollars without looking remotely excited. Neither Deb nor I spent a dime, being painfully aware of the statistical futility involved with gambling. However, upon regrouping with the remainder of our company, we discovered that carol had won $150 before losing most of it again to end up with $60; not bad for a $5 outlay. 
 
The hockey game was just going into overtime when we left the casino so we stood in front of a TV at a nearby patio and watched as nobody scored anything for the first OT. There was some pretty intense karaoke going on beside us, fuelled by a string of reliable 80's hits. Some of the singers were surprisingly good. A few of them were rewarded by people dancing to their songs. Deb's friend Brian was wearing a Tampa Bay jersey, which drew a more than trivial number of jeers. I was rather disappointed to see the Flames lose in the first minute of the second OT. 
 
The last thing we did in Niagara was to visit one of the many haunted houses there. It had a Dracula motif and offered three levels of fright: normal, brave and insane. Of course, we all had to pick insane. It wasn't as scary as they made it out to be. They did have people inside the maze to jump out an effort to scare us but one of them got inadvertently poked in the eye by Rich's best man. Taking it upon myself to give the rest of our party their money's worth, I forged ahead and crouched down in wait. When they came around the bend, I sprung up with a scream that almost knocked a few people over. [I would make such a great tiger.]
