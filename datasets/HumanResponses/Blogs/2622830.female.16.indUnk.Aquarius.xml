      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDon't you just love helping people out?  Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't.  Like Monday, I was driving home and passed a tree branch half hanging in the road.  I didn't care and I was going about 55 so I just drove buy.  Tuesday it was still there and I was feeling like a good samaritan, so I pulled over and got it all off the road and out of the way.  Today though, I topped that by a mile!  Although today it was a bit more painful and 'draining.'  That's right, I donated blood today.  I think everyone should  urlLink donate blood . &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasically, I did it through work.  I got outta work for over an hour and I still got paid for it.  And when I got back I didn't have to do any hard work.  But it was a really slow day and I was ahead of the game today so it didn't matter.  I went in and they asked me about all the drugs I do and all the sex I have with diseased 3rd world whores and all the time I spent in jail/juvienile hall and all the 3rd world countries I spent years in.  They poked my finger with a needle and got a drop of blood into some kinda tester thing and it said my blood was ok.  She sent me in the next room where they poked me...  AUGHHHHH!  YOU QUACK!  IT WHEN CLEAR THROUGH MY ARM!!!    Just kidding.  I didn't really yell that, but I was thinking about it.  Heh heh.  Well, the lady was really nice and did a great job.  I have good veins but since I'm a small guy, my bones are close so she has to make sure she doesn't pinch the vein against a bone.  She was great and talked to me and was really nice about it.  Some people don't know what they are doing and don't really care, but I only hear about that once in a while.  I'm a fast bleeder I guess because I was done in about 7 minutes and she said that has to be some kind of record for a guy my size.  Usually only big people are done quick.  It was only seven minutes, but it took FOREVER!  I absolutely hate having the needle in me.  It's kinda like the feeling you get when you hear fingernails scratching a chalkboard.  Only I felt it in my elbow.  Blegh!  It's still worth it though.  Blood supplies are low and I believe I have one of the more needed blood types.  I don't know which one it is, but the letter they sent me said it was the type they needed the most.  It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside!  IDK.  America needs blood so do your part people!  Just go  urlLink donate blood , please!?  You get cool stickers that say "Be nice to me, I donated blood today!"  Then you can show it to your girlfriend, say something dumb, and she won't beat you up for it!  Yay!  I was thinking I should keep it on the paper and keep it in the glove box just incase I get pulled over for speeding.  What kind of cop would give a speeding ticket to someone who has a sticker that says, "Be nice to me, I donated blood today!"?  "Sorry officer, all the blood I donated must have made me not realize just how fast I was going."  And there's gotta be a million more uses for it.  Well, that's all for now.  Thanks for reading!    The answer is, 'Yes, you ARE your brother's keeper.'  It is YOUR responsibility to watch out for each and every other person on this planet.  Big responsiblity, huh?  Well, don't worry, there's about 6 billion more people who are suppose to be sharing that responsibility with you.  If everyone just does their part, it'll all turn out okay in the end.  Everyone else might not be doing it, but that's no excuse for YOU not to do YOUR part.  Besides, just look at the benefits of this plan, now YOU have 6 billion people who are watching out for you.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWell, I haven't posted much this week. It's waaaay past my bed time and I should go to sleep, but I'm going to post anyway.  I know I'll regret it tomorrow at work so here goes nothing. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFriday night Crystal and I went to Enfield so I could buy oil and an oil filter so I could change the oil in my truck.  Since Crystal waited in the truck, I didn't want to spend a lot of time looking around.  It took me long enough to find the stupid oil filter.  I saw some cool looking lock boxes/tool boxes for the bed of my truck but I just looked quickly.  Then we went to Marshal's and Dots so Crystal could buy some pants.  After we ate at Taco Bell, we called Jay and Meghan who were hanging out at Trainor's.  I called Meghan and saw her sitting outside as we drove buy so I stopped and we all ended up outside talking.  We left and went to the shed and had some fun for a bit. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSaturday, after I went to Enfield with Jay and Meghan, I went down a dirt road at Soapstone.  This dirt road is normally blocked with a huge rock, so since it was moved, I wanted to see where it went.  After about a thousand feet, I realized I couldn't go anymore because of some rocks sticking out of the ground.  When I tried to back up, the truck didn't want to go anywhere.  I managed to get the truck back up about 50 feet.  What pissed me off is that if I could have gone another 2 feet I would have been fine.  Over an hour goes buy and we finally get a couple who was nice enough to stop and help tow us out.  I doubt they are reading this but  THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!   Well, I hauled ass back to Stafford to pick up Crystal so we could go to the Drive-ins like we had been planning on all week.  Well, I was getting the 'tude' again because apparently I ruined everything even though I didn't.  I was just going to make her go anyway but then we ended up just driving around for a few minutes and there was shouting and door slaming and people jumping out of moving vehicles.  Anyway, we talked about it and I basically came to the conclusion that she had a REALLY EXTREMELY  SUPER SHITTY  day at work.  We also got some bad stuff out of the way and everything was chil by the end of the night.  I love Crystal! &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspToday was good over all.  Crystal woke me up, then I woke up  urlLink Meghan  who then woke up Jason.  After I cleaned off my truck ($10) Jason and I changed the oil in our vehicles.  It was cool.  Had a mini OCP (oil changing party).  We were suppose to go to the beach but the weather wasn't that great so we decided on dinner and a movie instead.  Bryan, Matt, and Veronica all ended up coming over and we thought it would be cool to all go as a group.  Jason, Meghan, Crystal, and I went in one car while Matt took Veronica and Bryan.  We left together but Jason had to stop for gas so when we got there we couldn't find the others.  We found out they were at the Verison store so we went to Target to get some candy.  After we went into  I, Robot  and we are saving seats for three more people, Meghan gets a call and we find out that Matt, Veronica, and Bryan are going to see  Spiderman 2 .  I don't know why because we had already told them what we were going to see and they said that was cool.  We could have gone to see  Spiderman 2 .  I don't think Meghan and Jason saw it and Crystal and I did see it already, but we definitly would have gone to see it again because it was sooooo great.  Some people thought it was kind of rude.  I did too but I didn't really care about that.  I was more disappointed because I was looking forward to hanging out with my friends.  I know it sounds dumb because we would have just been sitting in the dark, not talking or anything, but anyone who reads my blogger already knows that what I really enjoy is being with my friends.  I didn't care if it was rude or not, I was just disappointed because I wasn't with all my friends.  I don't really care, and it's not even worth having any kind of arguement with a friend over.  It's not even worth mentioning in my blog.  I'm only commenting so much on this because I know they will read this and I want them to know that I'm not holding any grudge or anything.  However, I do think that this gives us the right to give them some guff if they ever invite us to go out to the movies!  ;-) &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEnough of that.  Well, after the movies we went to Friendly's and had dinner.  It was fun.  Good friends + good food = great times.  We all talked and ate and just had a great time.  I can't say it enough:  I don't care what it is you are doing (even if it is sitting in the dark, not talking to eachother), good friends always make it better.  After Friendly's, we hit up Jay's house for a bit and had a mini tail gate party.  Mini because I was the only one with a truck.  Yay! &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWell, now I'm home and I've posted all this and it is no longer waaaay past my bed time.  It is  WAAAAAAAAAAY  past my bed time!  So I'm off to bed everyone!  G'night cracka!   urlLink Postage is up!    Thanks for reading!

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI would just like to thank everyone for joining and posting.  I think this blogger is coming along very well.  I'm glad to see that Jason finally joined.  That was everyone on the waiting list.  If anyone else is reading this and wants to post also, just give me your e-mail adress.  E-mail me if you have to:     nvolpejr@cox.net  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDon't send anything to my old e-mail nvolpejr@lycos.com  I'm not using that anymore.  Anyway, I am trying to get everything for me online to be nvolpejr but I can't remember what my password to that screen name on AIM was, so for now, AIM is still Nick0VJr.  IDK. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWell, since this is my blog and all I guess I should post.  I don't really have too much to say now so I'll post more later.

       So, Nick, I see you are moving along with this cool ass shit.&nbsp; Okay dokay... so I am queer.&nbsp; I like the title though.&nbsp; Anyways, that's a lot of sex and I am not one of those crazy numbers... which makes little Bryan not to happy in the pants of bigger Bryan.&nbsp; Anyways.... the rantings of a completely "coked out"(coca cola) person while he has nothing better to do at work and that includes work.&nbsp; Gotta love the yellow.&nbsp; Did you that this yellow nonsense in teh actual blog editing window makes it really really hard to see.&nbsp; Try it sometime.&nbsp; :-P&nbsp; Okay before I ruin all the energy I have I will let every go with a cute little something.    &nbsp;  It's pretty much official that Now Entering The Middle will have humungous amount of extra donkey sex in the near future and that those of you who are lucky to participate should enjoy the several sexy dokeys that contribute to it's nonsense.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  This is Bryan.... signing out.    urlLink http://www.bryanfowler.com

      Tip - If your girlfriend is wearing a shirt with any kind of glitter on it, do  not  let her get in your bed until she takes the shirt off or you will be COVERED in glitter after laying in bed.  And do you have any idea just how big of a pain it is to try and get glitter off yourself?  Here's a hint:  it doesn't come off.  Volpe quotes... &nbsp&nbsp&nbspStuff - Each day, 100 million people engage in some form of sexual intercourse, resulting in 910,000 conceptions; 350,000 cases of sexually transmitted diseases; and at least a dozen orgasms thrown in for good measure.   - There are three times as many adult bookstores as there are McDonald's in the U.S.    "I'm Nick Volpe Jr. and I approve this post"

        Well I must say that I agree with Nick. This weekend was pretty good. I had alot of fun. But I dont really have anything else to say. Nick covered basically everything. I might go apply for a job at the hospital tomorrow. Thats about it I think. Goodnight everyone.      &nbsp;    Baby you're all that I want.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI discovered something this weekend:  The only thing you need to have a good time is to be with good friends.  It doesn't matter where I am, what I am doing, or anthing else because if I am with people who I care about and care about me, then  it is GREAT!  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLast weekend I came up with the idea to have a picnic at Bigalow Hallow and Jason and Meghan thought that it would be cool.  Crystal was excited when I told her too.  Andy, I'm  SO  sorry I forgot to call you!  Please forgive me!  (and send me your e-mail so I can invite you to this!)  On Saturday, we got together and headed out there.  We were behind some guy who was goin' soooooooo slow (45 mph) so we passed him.  We got in for free because we got the hook up from the girl at the booth because we knew her from high school.  Although I can't seem to remember her name right now so I guess I didn't know her that well.  Anyway, we got everything down to the picnic area and realized I forgot the plastic forks and knives.  Jay and I walked all the way back to the truck and then walked all the way back and realized there was an open parking space right up front now.  I kicked off my sandals and ran all the way back to the truck and broght it up front so we wouldn't have to carry the stuff or walk all the way back when we left.  After we had everything, we cooked our food (Natural History RULES!).  After we ate, we talked a bit then went swimming for an hour and a half.  That was so much fun.  I made a pile of rocks under water and we had a 'chicken fight.'  For those of you who were like me and didn't know what a chicken fight is, it is where the girls get on the guys' shoulders and they try to knock eachother off.  Meghan and Jason won and I almost drownd so we didn't try it again.  After swimming we made smores and toasted marshmellows.  That was a tastey gooey mess!  Just as we were done we could hear thunder off in the distance so we packed up quickly and left. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter we got cleaned up and changed, we relaxed at Jay's house for a bit and then went to Bummpers and played pool.  It was fun times playing pool.  After a while we did our usual 'we are all bored so lets just mess everything up' routine and just started all shooting at once.  When we left to bring the girls home, things ended kind of gayishly, but friends are friends because they can get over dumb shit and laugh about it later!  (Yeah Mr. I got out of paying for pool because I'm mad!  Good plan to save money!  J/K) &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspToday I picked up Crystal and Meghan and we went over Jays and I played with Jasmine(the dog) for a while.  We went for a walk downtown and I met a lot of people I haven't seen for a while.  Cool door poppers Dan, now shave those doors!  After we had ice cream we talked for a while and watched people drive by.  My lovely girlfriend started to get hungry again so we all had some pizza at Stafford House.  That was good, we had a cool waitress who looked at me wierd just for wanting a side of bacon.  Well, we walked back and hung out in the shed for a while.  I got the 'tude from Crystal for not being right next to her and getting up from the couch for a minute who then plays a game on a cell phone when I do sit next to her!  Well we wrestled and then made up.  It's all good.  You gotta be able to forgive and forget dumb shit like that.  Make that you WILL forgive and forget dumb shit like that if you want the relationship to last.  It just doesn't work any other way.  Well now I'm home and typing all this up and it's WAY past my bedtime, so I'm out ya'll!  Watch out for the middle!  Thanks for reading!    Beginnings are often scary and endings are usually sad; it's what's in the middle that counts.  Remember that next time you find yourself in the middle.

      Yes, as I am posting now, my web site is nothing more than a blank nonethingness that doesn't even appear when you type in my URL. Sad, I sat and wept mentally for minutes just to realize that I have money set aside and can be allocated to save it's life as I had before. Many of you who actually view my site know that my site was in a coma for a while, but recentally it awoke from that useless state in my blog and in the future a web site. Just to fall short with a little cancerous tumor which needs to be removed and treated. So, after the chemotherapy it will feel much better much stronger than before and you will be able to tell that it has been reprieved of that nasty cancer. I am taking care of this problem soon. Thank you.

       Hmmm... I think I will talk about the good things that have happened in the past couple days. Everything else isn't worth mentioning. Let's see Thursday I hung out with Crystal again which was cool. Then we went to Nick's where us three hung out and then Jay joined us once he got home from work. Then Friday morning Crystal and I went shopping. We didnt plan on going it just happened while we waited for Nick to get out of work. Then me her and Nick went to Six Flags and then to the Drive Ins. Then I hung out with Jay for a little bit. It was cool. Shopping was fun. I got a rings, toe rings, bracelets, a necklace, a shirt, flip flops, and earrings. It was fun. I am glad I had money to buy stuff. Now most of its gone. Oh well it was worth it. I was gonna get a black skirt but I decided not to. Crystal and I tried on these wicked cute shoes. Very tempted to buy them. She also got wicked cute shoes for $5. Awesome deal! Shopping was cool. Cant wait to go again. Hopefully sometime soon. Six Flags was good too. I finally got to use my season pass which was good. My picture came out pretty sucky but they all do so whatever. It was wicked hot today. We should of worn our bathing suits and gone in the water park but we didnt. We went on a couple rides that got us cooled off which was good. Oh ya on the way out they gave us Coke C2 and IT SUCKS! After Six Flags we all felt gross so we went home and showered then got together again and went and saw The Village and Spiderman 2. The Village sucked! But Spiderman 2 was good. I must say that today was pretty good day.       Now its like 3:30ish am Saturday morning and I am bored and online and just ate pizza and chicken cutlets. Eh, I was hungry what can I say. Wicked upset that Boy Meets World isnt on. Im having withdrawls from Boy Meets World and 7th Heaven. Haha, just kidding. :-P          Thank you for the invite to the movies Trainor and Beth :)       Oh ya my parents left Thursday for Vermont. My grandparents came up Thursday and spent the night but they are gone now. So basically me and Amanda have the house to ourselves for the weekend because Cara and Jeana are gone for the weekend too. They went with their friends to Vermont also. Finally some peace and quiet.        Well I think Im going to go upstairs and sleep or atleast attempt to sleep. One of the two. Goodnight everyone. Well, actually, Good morning. :)

We played with the cube for ever loving every minute of the joy it shared with us. For hours we were in a zen like state laughing and taking mushrooms to go faster and steal ballons. We also shot red and green shells at each other and it was fun. I will leave you with this Hi this is daisy.

       Last night after leaving Trainor's Jay and I went to his house where we hung out with Nick and Crystal for a little bit. Crystal got&nbsp;glitter EVERYWHERE cuz&nbsp;she was wearing her glittery shirt.&nbsp;:-P&nbsp;Then today Me, Nick, and Jay went to Enfield then up to Soapstone where we got stuck in the mud! FOR EVER! Well not for ever it was actually like over an hour. But ya we got stuck, couldnt get the truck out. Nothing was working so then this couple drove by in a BIGGER truck so I told them we needed help and that we were stuck in the mud and they were nice enough to help us. Andy and Matt and Adam drove up there too to try and help. Im glad those people helped us. If they didnt we may have been there a while longer. Well after we got out of the mud Nick brought me and Jay to Jay's house and he went to go hang out with Crystal. We didnt do much tonight. Just hung out. I saw Stephanie while she was working and talked to her for a while which was cool. When I came home there was   purple   mascara in my room which means either my mom or my sister got it for me while they were in Enfield today.   Wicked Awesome!   Im excited!     I love purple! :)   Well I think Im going to go to bed. Tomorrow I was suppose to go to the beach but the weather isnt suppose to be that great so I think Im going to the movies and out to eat instead with Jay Nick and Crystal. We will have fun and just go to the beach on a nicer day. :) Good night everyone!

I didnt sleep good last night. I went to sleep at like 1 and woke up at 4 and couldnt fall back asleep until like 7 and didnt sleep that great that finally I decided toget up at like 9:30. Then I ate Breakfast, stacked wood, and showered and stuff. Then Pieny picked me up and me and her went to her parents house and we picked up her brother and we all went out.

        Today I woke up around 10, made some food then watched 7th Heaven.  I love that show!  Then I decided to go outside and tan cuz it was nice out.  So I was tanning and listening to Full House and then I got hot so i went inside for a few.  Then I went back outside and tanned some more and let my sister throw a water balloon at me.  Oh ya and in between all this I attempted to make some water balloons and Im not that great at tying them so water just kept going everywhere and I MEAN EVERYWHERE.  It was funny.  Then I was wondering what would happen if you froze a water ballon so I made a water balloon and put it in&nbsp;a container and put it in the freezer . It didnt freeze completely though.  Oh well&nbsp;it was still fun.&nbsp; Then I showered and stuff and watched Step By Step and ate fruit salad.   I LOVE FRUIT SALAD!  So basically today I did the usual went online and watched tv.&nbsp; Then my parents got home and my dad yelled at me for not&nbsp;cleaning up my mess.  Oh well Im over it.&nbsp; Then around 5:30 Crystal and Nick picked me up.  As we left my house i realized I left my water/half frozen balloon on the counter so we went back and got it.  Next stop was Jasons house.  We went there and picked him up then we were on our way to Bigalow to go swimming again.  Me and Nick swam from one side to another side then we took a trail back to where we were.  It was fun.  My legs hurt after a while and so did his arms.  The four of us had fun.  Then after we left I realized I forgot my sandals in the parking lot.  Yes I know Im dumb.  But Nick forgot his too!  So we turned around and went back for our sandals.  I still have water in my ear and its really annoying.  Then Crystal dropped me and Jay off at his house and we hung out for a bit then he brought me home.  Now Im home and I ate two cosmic brownies.   I LOVE COSMIC BROWNIES!  Now Im watchin tv and talking to people and Im gonna try and watch Badder Santa and maybe Dickie Roberts Former Child Star . I dont know if I will be able to stay up long enough to watch them both but I will try.  Well I think that was all I wanted to say.  Bye!

       Lets see... I sat home for the day. It was pretty nice out and I should have tanned but I was lazy and didnt shower til like 3:30 and just sat and watched tv and went online all day. Then when Jay got out of work he picked me up. We went to his house and Nick met us there and then the three of us went to Bigalow to go swimming. It was cool. The water was nice. I was doing a headstand and I cut my finger on a rock and it hurt and was bleeding alot so I got out of the water. Then after a little while Jay and Nick got out of the water and we left. Then Nick dropped us off at Jays and me and Jay just watched tv. Now I am home and online and watching tv agian..  :-P  Well goodnight everyone!  :)      Oh ya and I was just looking at&nbsp;my younger sister's profile (Jeana) and I see she created her own blog...&nbsp;  urlLink  http://xOhugs_n_kissesOx.blogspot.com  &nbsp; She chose the same template as&nbsp;I did and she put hearts around her&nbsp;name just like&nbsp;I did.. Grrr... Oh well what are you gonna do.       &nbsp;   On a Monday, I am waiting  Tuesday, I am fading  And by Wednesday, I can't sleep  Then the phone rings, I hear you  And the darkness is a clear view  Cuz you've come to rescue me   Fall... With you, I fall so fast  I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts   [Chorus:]  Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I like the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you've known me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me   I am moody, messy  I get restless, and it's senseless  How you never seem to care  When I'm angry, you listen  When youre happy, it's a mission  And you wont stop 'til I'm there   Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast  Well, I hit that bottom  Crash, you're all I have   [Chorus:]  Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I like the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you known me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me   How do you know everything I'm about to say?  Am I that obvious?  And if it's written on my face...  I hope it never goes away... yeah   On a Monday, I am waiting  And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms...  So I can breathe   [Chorus:]  Ohhhhh  It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real  I love the way that feels  Ohhhhh  It's as if you've know me better than I ever knew myself  I love how you can tell  Ohhhhh  I love how you can tell  Ohhhhh  I love how you can tell  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...

       Today was alright.&nbsp;I&nbsp;sat around watching tv for a while then when&nbsp;Nick got out of work and I showered and stuff he brought me to the Hospital where I applied for a job and picked up a volunteer packet for my sister. Then after that we went to Evergreen so I could apply for a job there also. Hopefully I hear from one place and get hired. I could use a job. It would give me money which I need and something to do. After that Nick brought me home and I went online and watched tv and ate dinner with my family (havent done that in a loooonnnngggg time). Then I went online again and talked to Jay. Then Beth and Trainor picked me up and we went back to their place where I hung out with them and Jay. Now I am home and Boy Meets World is on soon so I will probably watch that and then maybe go to sleep.

I got a season pass for Six Flags last week so I am hoping to go there soon. Today I am going to go apply for a job at the hospital and maybe Evergreen too. Im not sure yet. I wish it was sunny and nice out cuz I want to get&nbsp;tanner.

       This weekend was a good one. Friday during the day I ended up playing basketball with Andy and few others. It was cool. I hadnt hung out with Andy in a while. This weekend was fun but I dont feel like going in to too much detail about it. I got to hang out with a couple people that I havent hung out with or seen in a while. Im now home. I left Friday. It was nice to not be at home for a couple days. Tomorrow I go to the dentist which should be fun. Hah. But for right now I am gonna go upstairs read my magazine, maybe watch some tv, and go to sleep in my own bed. :)
