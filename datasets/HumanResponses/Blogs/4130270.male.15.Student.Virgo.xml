      Well I haven't been able to get anybody to repley to blogs about me So I thought I would put some opinion into the page.  Well here it goes.  I Despice the way Goerge W. Bush went about revenging 9-11.  I believe with popular support that he used 9-11 for his own twisted plot to capture Saddam Hussien.  I don't believe Hussien had anything to do with 9-11 and furthore more I believe Bush hasn't been looking for Osama Bin Laden with all of his power insteed he has ben focusing on Hussien.  Now that I have either made you completly hotter than a teapot or mad you say Hallaluia there are sain people in this nation I am going to explain myself.  It has been proven by many by many political leaders including republicans that Bush has wanted to go to war with Iraq since before his term even began.  Actually in my opinion he has wanted to go ever since his father was unsuccessful.   I believe that Bush started using tactics since right after 9-11 that would make the general public "satisfied" with the capture of Hussien.  The tactics thatI speak of are his constent speeces/remarks about how bad Hussien is, how he is in league with Al-Quida, and how Bin Laden is hiding in Iraq.  Also Bush has been refering to Bin Laden and Hussien as little more than one unitfor so long many people have decided if you capture Hussien Bin Laden is no more.  But in reality Bin Laden is still out there and so is the terrist threat.  All this WAR, Not Freedom Fight, Has done for us is kill hundreds of American Soldiers and increase our National debt sooo much that we have to raisae our dept limit or not "pay our bills".  Now don't get me wrong except for this one MAJOR disagreement I have with him I like most of his other view points.  Now if I made youmad post to tell me how wrong I am and I f you agree with me post to help me with anything I left out.  Hope to Reasd from YOU soon.  Laterz,

      Hi everybody. Well today I just got back from my school Registration. It ws very unorganized. the sheets with a "todo list" was really scramble. Well anyway It has just sunk in that 3 of my friends are moving to different states this year. One of my friends is moving to California another is moving to Arizona and yet another is going to Texas. I am going to miss them all it is very sad. Two of them were on the forensics team with me and both did CX for at least Part of the year.  I went camping last night and realized that even nowadays when plp "Rough it" they not only have indoor plumbing but a lot of them bring their house(RV's). Over 3/4 of there "campers" were in RV's. I mean why go camping if your going to bring a house and all of its comforts with you... Come on plp.   Later,

      Hi person-that-has-nothing-better-to-do-than-read-about-me!!!!  I'm only kidding.  Well I found this website when messing around on yahoo search with a friend, Hi Casey, well she found it really.  on of her shurch interns has a blog on here.  Well this site if you haven't guessed is going to be my Homepage, thus it will be filled with various things about my life.  Pretty boring.  Maybe it will one day be about more stuff.  Well I guess I will give a brief bio to start with.                I am a sophmore in High school.  I enjoy speech and literature.  I have 2 brothers and a mom.  We all live in the U.S.A.  i am on my High school forensics team.  I participate in the hardest type of debate, Cross-Examination or CX for short.  My Cx partner, Josh, is a total Rep.  so we disagree on a lot of issues in debate.   I completly despise all of Bush's tactics with war and some of his others.  Josh on the other hand is the biggest Bush supporter in the world.  I plan to go to college to get a degree in theology and philosophy to be a youth minister when I am older.  I love texas and hope to move their when I move out of home.  I am a big tech fan but an even bigger Huskers fan (college sports).   Well I can't think of anything else to say right now.  Maybe I will write soon.                                               Later,
