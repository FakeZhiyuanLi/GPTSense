       weird how life is isnt it? some ppl&nbsp; fall in love with some one whos in love with some one else, others dont have enough to eat, still others want out of their marrige , and some others just cant seem to get their marrige working.   Starving millions in sudan, drug dealers and drug addicts. serial killers , war, murders, pain, death, sorrow&nbsp;  why ?  Who matters an individual or society?

       Decided to go back home. I mean theres nothing else here for me, prolly go home recoup and try again to get out of that godforsaken place. I'd still have to live of my folks , but thats only until i beginto fly. Once i do, theres no holding me back . I'll repay them with the debts ive incurred&nbsp;, which is currently 10000GBP. A lotta money. lol im neck deep in debt, neck deep in love with a&nbsp; gal whom i;d probably never meet (for her sake atleast) and&nbsp;I have nothing to hold on to    When all that you wanted     And all that you had     Don’t seem so much     For you to hold on to     For you to belong to&nbsp;     [JET : Hold On ]       &nbsp;

       So here I stand at the edge of my world, having lost all that I never really found. She was something to live for, but what do you do when the one you love the most, loves another the way you love her. I decided to leave; well I didn’t have much of a choice didn’t I? Told her I’d stand by her side. She said she needs me to be with her as a friend. Does she, when she’d have all that she wants by her side? I will always be by her side, always have since the day I met her. I couldn't leave even if i wanted to. She’s got real friends, real people, people who matter, I not among those people who’d matter. It wouldn’t matter if I pass away, I won’t be missed.  &nbsp;  I guess this is my measure about how many lives you have touched and made a difference, I haven’t touched or made a difference in anyone’s life. I’m afraid, I guess I’m still looking for some one to come and save me. In a way I was sure that it was her. It’s not something you can blame, it’s not something that you can point a finger on and say that was the reason it didn’t work out. All I’d say that it’s my fault; I fell for her she didn’t for me.  &nbsp;  I guess now that I always say that I’m back to the way I was, everyone’s gonna be happy. Can I really be like the person I was? It isn’t easy bolting up your feelings inside and keeping them there, those last few happy memories for you know that you wont have anymore of those, no matter how much you want to have more.  &nbsp;   Is this the end?  So we now part as friends  You said you need in your life for ever as a friend  We will meet some day if things don’t go your way  I pray that we don’t meet, for you I pray  I wanted to travel though medieval cities  Watch setting suns, and the frosty ice lands  Lush treed forests, holding you in my hands  But this is the end where we part as friends &nbsp;

      Hi..  I've been thinking . Trying to do everything to get you out of my mind.. Tried talking .. Shutting you out ..By watching movies,sleeping,walking,cycling,praying,church,reading  .. I'm outta options everything I see some one I think of you , I see a girl running I think of you ,I see an ambulance I think of you ,  I see a billboard with a girl I think of you..I watch a movie, there's always something in the movie that reminds me of you, I cant sleep without thinking if yer sleeping in peace , wake up and think .... I wish she's thinking of me ..I'm sorry C I cant shut you out,everything I see or do  reminds me of you.   As much as I know that things between us wont workout cant seem to forget you.sorry if I send you a lot of texts and mails. I miss you. I know you don't have any feelings for me . I'm just a friend. I'm trying to be there C as a friend.. I just miss being there and holding your hand feeling secure .. but then again this is how I feel when I'm with you..I know that I don't make you feel the same .. So it cant be anything more than a friend ( some where deep down inside I think I've lost even that right)  I guess I always thought I made a difference in your life..Like u had made in mine...guess not ..I still care C  ..Its just that everytime I do, I lose you.. I lost you once soon after I reached here , we never mailed each other much, then again in December.. and now. Why cant I just let go of you and forget all these weird feelings I have for you ? I want to.i cant sit still without thinking of you.  wish I could have this big magic wand I could wave and make you the happiest person on the whole world , and make me like you as a friend.   I don't expect any reply for you, cos I've been a jerk and I've said stuff like how I feel.    ------------------------------------------------------------ dear C,           i cant let go .. i have been trying to let go .. everytime i do i seem to miss you more. i know u dont have the same feelings for me ... i wish that you did .. but i guess i understand .. i am not good enough .  maybe some day when u think if things arent going your way .. or you feel that lfes  i guess if i dont see you today i'll understand C, i am not important.  maybe some day if you find that special bond that we had ( dunno if its caled love) you know where to find me .. i am sure i wont hear from you for a while. sorry C. im sorry i fell in love with you  yer friend  viv

      I decide to rush off to work , but they hve cancelled my shifts for today, cos i missed the last shift, and didnt bther telling them.Well i guess its ok.. didnt feel like working today.  Met my Ghanian friend, Ebenizer.... well i havent sopken to him in a long time since i first saw him at manchester.I have said hi-how are you - bye though whenever i see him.Decide dto go ask god for help. Visited church , attended a sermon( i appreciated the music was rockish - gospel) and listened to a weired sermon about gates and shutting the darkness... all i could think of was gates to shut her out and gates to hold me in , so that i can stay aloof... and not think of her anymore.  After that i went and watched Bruce almighty (again) .. his last 2 wishes to god.. um i'd have asked the same for her.It kept making me wish i were dead. I cant i just miss her .. aint got anyone to speak to it about, hold it all inside.  Then decide dto visit an other indian friend. Lunch at his palce.More taling .. still had her in my mind.She doesnt wanna leave.   Came online, and spoke to her BF . " just her fears about some things. she does love me and the feelings are there i just need to build on them " that hurt bad. really really bad. why cant i let go of her ?   Decided to run away.Dont know where. Met Rita Rotsalynan ( Finnish female from work) she used to speak to me, benice to me .. she has suddenly turned snooty .. well i dont care. wish she had invited me to her place to hang out with her  . all i wanted was some one to speak to.  Decided to go to the movies. I biked half way .. walked around the river bank for about 2 hours..ranting and raving at god... he's not listenin. Wanted to speak to some one so badly ..,. decided to call Dave his mobile numbers changed (is he really my best friend if he cant tell me about the change in his number ?) kept trying ... wanted to call her up and say "  why dont you get the hell outta my head "  walked a long distance until i reached a section where there was no track .. ploded along .. but decided not to go any further as it got thicker along the banks ... missed her loads and loads .. why cant i just let go ?  Decided to go and watch a movie . watched "The dAy after tomorrow". everytime the camera zoomed in on Sam's (Gyllenhaal) g/f .. all i could do was think of her.Still feeling sick about the entire episode.The movie was ok.

As much as i wanna text her and send her mails .. i keep trying not to .. there is no "us" .. its her and me... well now it more so seems like me ... she never gets online .. i've lost  her again . lost her like i did in december .. have this big viopd that no one can fill but her .. wish i made her feel the same .. why me god? why me ?  She came back when life was bleak .. notthats its any better now that i've lost her too.  Im trying not to give in .. my lifes in shambles.. i guess lifes a whole lot better when you have some one by your side ... just wish it was her  im off to work .. i guess i dont like coming online ..   I feel confused, these strange emotions that she brings about in me.At home things arent very good .Lisa's BF has moved in, makes me feel odd. I am hardly home offlate .Spend my time somewhere else or in the lab, go home at odd hours and hope that I dont see them. I ugessthats where C came in, she made me feel secure.   Why do i ever fallin love with people who dont care?

      had a lil barbeque in the kitchen .. the oil i was gonna use caught fire and the flames were licking high.. the whole place above the stve was pitch black. well not my faultthat oil catches fire anyway it was an accident.. glad that we dont have smoke alarms . else we'd have had the whole place ringing with alarms .. anyway it wasnt a very big fire. i asked her to open the back door so i could take it out and deal with it . she wanted to dump a wet towel over it i was holding it damn i dodnt want any of the oil cracking and spitting over my hands . ( the oil was buring in a wok) ..i eventually let her dump the wet towel over it .. lisa was making a big f deal about nothing.   today morning she says that she wants to have a talk and dredges up topics on how i stole her comp. excuse me i borrowed it and i just didnt tell her when i was gonna return home anyway .. mistrustful bitch .. so she starts off by saying some crap about the atmosphere and ... goes on raising her voice .. i told her that im keeping to my own .. and not troubling her .. she also said some shit that she had complained to the police about the comp.she added that i was showing attitude , i told her not to raise her voice .. well she went on yelling somethin i wasnt paying attention . she said that im supposed to buy stuff for the house .. if she wants to she can .. im done with her . i aint cleaning stuff/ buyng anything thats not required for me.  she said that i dont say bye while leaving the house ..... who is she, that i must answer to her ? if i go on like this i will end up huring ppl and i will be all alone. as though i care. i care about a few ppl thats all, others dont matter ,never have never will.shes the one with issues, u stay out of my way and i will out if your way . i dont ask her to speak to me. no wonder none of her bfs stick around. ( i know that sounds rude. but like i said i dont care)  well shes suposed to leave today . for the weekend she still hasnt .shes probably going to leave a whole lot of "post it notes" all over the house ....   i have an answer to all post it notes. "whatever" (as jen said .. its a polite way of saying fu)  damn some ppl . why cant they let me be.

      When all your dreams come crashing down again  All that you had built up, All the things you dreamt of  Its all over  Nothing sems to matter, anymore The love that you had ,  The job that you worked for  They all seem to fade away  As i stare at my reflection  I see myself as a ... loser  when the only thing that gave you hope was a job prospect and now when you see it gone, a love that doesnt exist, a life thats no longer there . all i can say is that its all over   what do you do when the evry dreams that get you through the day turn and crumble into dust right in front of your very eyes?what do you do when the will to exist no longer ceases to breathe?

      missed her a lot. had no one to speak to . imagine going through days without speaking to anyone.  it was lonely, i walked a lot just walked, among those large buildings felt secure in a way,lost,alone,had nothing to worry about but i missed her . a yearning to break free from this stupid grasp of love, a sense of hopelessness .... just wanted to share so much with some one, just wanted some one to be there ..  i tried running away from all these feelings, i guess thats why i walked , so i wouldnt think of her it doesnt really help. seeing couples, hearing ppl with an american accent,seeing women who have brown hair, all of them in  a way happy..i couldnt run away.

      "another non-combatant beheaded by militants in iraq..."  Why are there so many deaths? dont these people realize that they cant change the system by beheading a few.. the system cannot be changed ... revolutions just get a new sysyem in place that over the years will deacay.nothing changer .. eventually the country is run by a few , we as masses just exist .. attimes its us individuals that matter .. our petty lives all the people that we know .. nothing else .  Why do i feel sorry for these people .. feel sorry for their mothers and their relatives... i know no ones gonna grieve for me if i get killed, well except for mum   Thought of her today morning while packing my bags.. keep telling myself that its over no matter how much i want it not to be over.

Robs finised designing his thesis , all he has left is the implementation.  I was shit scared yesterday about my dissertation.Still think of her, jkeep tellin myself to let go.She replied saying that shes doing ok.No emotions in her reply,is it what im dreading of losing something that i never had ?I dont know ... ive lost a lot before already maybe this time it doesnt matter .. nothin matters.  all i do is sit and listen to punk rock, sad songs about heart aches and breakups.its helping i guess .. i'll be ok. always have always will. cant let go but i'll be ok .   am i missing mum ? in a way i do .. in a way i dont. mums are always there arent they?friends ..... are they aways there or do they just lose touch ... friends just leave   [random thought out of the blue]  think or her , it doesnt hurt when i miss her ... just that i see a lotta things that remind me of her .... i still dont know what im holding on to  [end-random thought out of the blue]  Got my project proposal typed in, the lecturer aint in. I'm leaving for london ( hope i get killed . or beaten up so that i end up with amnesia... i wont be missed by many except for mum and angel) well i wont remember and i'll end up with a spotless mind, isn't that a good thing     These NOFX guys write some really good lyrics . Been listening to a song called "where's my slice" the lyrics are interesting    We'll spend the day protesting all the problems that we're facing Anything but face reality  Where's my slice? I want more than equal rights I want everything for free!   Atleast they dont have weired anarchist theories like . who was the band that screamed "wake up... wake up.... " ... well u know whom i mean anyway  Im bored i'm off home to get some stuff and i'll head back here to start work.

      MXPX LYRICS  "Without You"  I got a confession to make That my heart would break To hear you say goodbye You're my every dream You're the threadwork to my seams And you know that I can't lie, when I say  I can't stop thinking about you I can't stop thinking about how My heart's empty without you  I just hate myself To think of you with someone else To hear you say goodbye I love you for who you are No more, no less And you know that I can't lie, when I say. . .  My dreams will never come true without you

      i miss her a lot. I know i shouldnt miss her, they why am i having these wierd feelings ? Life seems empty when i dont hear from her. I wish i could catch a plane and go meet her .. i cant seem to concentrate on anything else . keep blaming god .. but does he really exist? If he does does he really care ?    Artist: Blink-182  Song: I Miss You   Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)   I got locked out of my room today , had to cycle twice in the rain to the accommodation office to go get the right set of keys.I go have a shower and when i get back up the door's locked.. blasted luck ... i guess i was lucky cos i still had a set of tracks and a T,i could atleast go out and i didnt have to ask Lisa.    Lisa is still being  a bitch .   Think a lot about C, wish she's ok .I wish that she calls / leaves offliners more often , i guess she wont understand the way i feel about her, even if she did, she'd have to love me ... keep having this thought of free well in my head from  Bruce Almighty  why must i be the one to miss her ? why me ?    Artist: Sugarcult Song: Memory    This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same      Artist: Simple Plan Song: I'd Do Anything  Another day is goin by im thinkin about you All the time but your out there and im here waiting And wrote this letter in my head cuz so many things were left unsaid but now your gone and i cant think straight  This could be the one last chance To make you understand  I'd do anything just to hold you in my arms to try to make you laugh somehow i cant put you in the past i'd do anything just to fall asleep with you will you remember me? cuz i know i wont forget you

      Why dont friends keep in touch? I mean is it asking too much of Dave or C to send me an email, or give me a blank/ missed call ? Maybe it is asking too much ... or arent they just real friends?dave still hasnt bothered giving me his new number .. i mean why must he care, after all i guess im not worthy enough of being given a new number  C i guess shes too busy getting better and being with real people, ppl who really matter, i dont matter.  Spoke to sal yesterday, her mums back,i hope aunty calls.   Some where along the line ive become this "thing" that craves for a little recognition an acknlowdgement,from people i know, to tell me that i am being thought of and i'm not forgotten . Alas, its just doesnt work that way i guess. No one really cares, not unless you are real. Am i real?

      sat up all night watching movies, maybe in a way hoping that all these things in my head will get sorted out. didnt help much , ended up watching a si-fi horror called "the thing" while flipping between whoopie goldberg's "Made in America" and cant remmber what else .. followed by "Pyromaniacs love story". love all the way all night ? maybe its the closest i can ever get to the real thing. lol for now . for ever ? { you'd never know what fate has in store for you , i could die now ,or probably loose my lower torso, my brain , my mind , my head who knows ?)   she replied which kinda made me feel better, just dunno if i was missed by anyone.home here i come, not that i want to but cos i have no choice.

       Some of the funniest scenes that made me chuckle with glee.  Brendan Fraser is one of those ppl who i respect immensely. He;s the geek in all of us, moreover he's got class, hes good looking and well manered. He's commited to his family and work. Havent seen him using a lot of swear words in his movies. His comedy is not like jim carrey's or adam sandler's in your face kind of a comedy. His one liners are witty. (Boy... am i rambling or what).&nbsp;I like him beacuse i can identify with&nbsp;some of the characters he's protrayed.    &nbsp;  The Mummy  Rick O'Connell... Hangman: Any last requests, pig?  Rick: Yeah, loosen the knot and let me go. &nbsp; Evelyn: By the way, why did you kiss me?  Rick: I don't know. I was about to be hanged. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  &nbsp;  George of the Jungle  George have strring of special feelings right now..good thing shes same species &nbsp;  Blast from the Past    urlLink Adam : Uh, Eve, this is Adam. Look, I just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me. And I wanted to tell you that I... that uh... that I wish so many good things for you. I wish so hard that all of your dreams come true, and... and that's all I... and that's all.  &nbsp;  that ^^ C is for you .    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Sitting here and wondering what's gonna become of my life. Staring at a blank screen , no one here to speak to. none of th eppl i kno are online, never really had a lotta&nbsp;friends in real life.  &nbsp;  Staring out of my window watching clouds drift past slowly, i would give a limb and a portion of my soul just to have C with me her now. ( a portion&nbsp;of my soul, hell all of it , if need may be).Storm clouds gathering, adding to th depressive atmosphere that already prevails.  &nbsp;  Watch little birds fly away watching them become smaller and smaller, the further away they go, until they eventually disappear.  &nbsp;  Lisa is in manchester for the day (and night). wish that she'd never come back(lol)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have the 99 red baloons song singing in my head. wonder what Eddie's is up to.He probably&nbsp;still chilling in Mexico.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  [As you can see i am bored as hell .. gonna pop and&nbsp;have a look at rob's site . lol see how much he progressed in his work .. damn which&nbsp;reminds me i still havent seriously started]  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Angel's internet connections gonna be terminated soon, its sad cos she’s the last person I have left. Why does god try and take away everything I have or I have ever wanted? (I don’t have too many wants) I’m worried about her. She’s always been there for me. She was an angel and she will always be my guardian angel. I wonder how she is going to get on with her life. I cant help her even if i wanted to, its really frustrating!   To make matters worse, still, no sign of C. As much as I want to contact her, I’m trying not to. I guess it’s gonna end up like dawn. She won’t keep in touch and well I’ll just bear the brunt and live on. I never was worth much to anyone. Why must things never for once go my way?  Been thinking of going back home, least I’d be there at home for mum. All my life all what I’ve wanted was some one to love me. lol I guess that’s what a lotta people want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I always though that she’d be the one.   Why is it, that all we guys have this concept of some one who’d save us from ourselves? I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it will all be over now in a few more days, I’ll be back where I started. Alone and unloved, except by mum. Then again aren’t mums and dads supposed to love you, no matter how you are?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Mums 59, I guess it’s better to go home and stay with her rather than staying here alone. That way even though I may not be happy, at least mum will be. Maybe a death to all the things that I want to do and the things I want to see. [Shrug] That’s what life is about, sacrifices and choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I have another interview on Monday; I don’t really give a damn about it now. Life doesn’t seem to matter anymore. I did a while ago when I had some one to work for. With every passing day things get harder. Try living your life in loneliness, its not that I choose to be this way. Things happen and at the end of the day I end up being alone. I do know there are a lot more important things besides me, Im not going to raise my hands and say …” but what can I do?” How can I help some one if I can’t help myself?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Whooshes gotta new guy. I’m happy for her. They are making long term plans. She’s another person who’s living her life to the max. The good old American dream. I dared to dream once; it got shot down before it even grew wings. Dave’s on the roll with his new job. I hope he sticks to this one and the politics doesn’t get to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  I made peace with Lisa the other day. So things are better at home. Not that&nbsp;&nbsp; I like her , just that if I can hurt one less person I might as well do .As dad always says “what are you going to gain my making enemies when you are going to leave, might as well part as friends.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still haven’t been able to find any accommodation for the last 1 month here .I don’t know what to do, I don’t have just enough money to get through.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do i miss her, at least it not the hurt and miss feeling (not yet). I just can’t stop thinking about her. How’s it all gonna end I don’t know. Will I end up alone, stuck at home still living with my folks? Will be able to travel around the world with C or with a bunch of friends? Will I be able to road trip? I'm not asking much am I.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Take me down to the roads again  To the lonely interstates and skies,  And all I ask is a big bike and a map to steer me by   Another Friday night passes by , lonely as I stand. All days seem alike. It was her who made a difference. I actually wanted to do so much for her, i would have, I still do. A man without hope that’s what I’ve become. I'll move on, these things won’t hurt me anymore (I won’t have anymore of these kind of feelings ever) &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; I’m glad that Angel's kitten is ok. Least she will have some one when she goes offline. Weird isn’t it how little things can make u smile. I’m sitting here smiling at a little kit that I haven’t seen who’s making&nbsp; Angel smile. &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; As you get to know people you begin to wonder how alike they all are with respect to you. It’s like u see splinters of you in their woodwork&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Friend's don’t just get up and go away.

      Its been happening for a while right now. I get up and one of the 1st things that come to my mind is her. I grab my phone to see what time it is and to see if shes called or sent a text, though deep inside i do know the answer. The times roughly what i think it is  atleast i know when its 7o clock, 9'o clock or whatever the time might be. Lie in bed knowingthat she asleep, probably dreaming and getting much needed rest.   They say that loves something thats suposed to make you feel happy. All the forms of love that i've had have never given me happiness. " There no one there to catch you when you fall, It's survival in the city - Eagles".   It aint easy trying to forget sone one you care about, as much as i want to forget and move on i find it difficult to do so     Joel: Why do I fall in love with every woman I see that shows me the least bit of attention?   I couldnt have asked for a better  movie in my life at the time i watched it.

      Feeling helpless. I cant help anyone  no matter how much I want to. Wish some one would help me out of this why god why me?   I culdnt sleep last night, all i could do was lie awake and think of her . I'm wasting time on her i guess, but friends dont get up and go... do they ?

      last spoke to her on the 4th of jly. I still havent heard form her .AS much as i want to let go , i dont want to either.I dont want much at this point just want to speak to her and see that shes ok . Well arent they always ok ? Times it feels like no one cares and nothing can ease the pain inside except a certain some one but when the some one aint there how do you move on ?

      angel's lil kitten seems to be ok . doesnt move a lt , just sits there. she said that the docs told her that it has no broken bones . i just wish that the lil soul can give her the strength she needs to snap out and start again .  but then again , life has a sick and twisted way of kicking you in the face when u least expect it .   its like this kitten signifies hope. Hope for something better.

      Life has a  weired way of getting back doesnt it ? daves got a new job , working for a high advnture company doing stuff that well he always wanted to do in the army .. i hope this palce offers the same deal to him.Is some one so buzy that hey cant even keep in touch ? Aroo said thatthey were speaking about me ... prolly thinking that im living my life .lol @ living my life.   Angel gets a kitten that she loves only to have the kitten get stomped upon.  I dont know if i;ve lost Lisa's CD.I just wish i dont have anything to do with her. I miss C  more  than ever.  I try to forget the memory creeps in, one way or the other.  These little things that actually mean squat if you consider life as a whole .. but this is my life , my friends .. ppl i care about ... ppl who make me happy / sad. Must we be content with the things we get , even though we desire something thats equivalent but does provide us with happiness , even though it its just for a little while ?  Sometimes i dont know if there is a god, if everything that we do is already writtn down(predestiny), this whole concept of soulmates , why some ppl are stronger and more capeable of coping with situations , why some ppl are insecure and others insensitive to others and worst of all why do we love/care.   I guess its better for me to live in a society where you dont have emotions . i'll blend in very well.  Having thoughts about me living all alone and my sister being well off, thoughts like that i had penned down a good six years ago re-surfacing . No i wont go and ask them for help. whom can i ask for help . no one helps . well the ones who can , cant and the ones who wont , well they just wont help. Maybe i always find it easier to live in poverty,I never did have too many materialistic wants.   Times i wonder if im clinically depressed . Not enough happy chemicals in my head . Well like all things come to an end i beleive that my story will come to an end too.A  happy one or a sad one , i dont know .I sure hope it doesnt end up as a lonely one ... but then again , im so used to being alone .. it wouldnt matter.

      I guess thats how it always ends in the movies, the good guys gets what he wants.Spiderman2 is a love story i guess.Peter Parker waiting for Mary Jane Watson and she eventually realizes that she loves him and goes to be with him .   Wonder what would have happened in real life if we say spiderman didnt have all those powers, but was still leading a double life as a vigilantee ? He'd have died a slo death alone , among the ones he loved but yet unable to do or say anything about how he felt.

      To Dave: You are a fucktard! How many months has it been since i have last spoken to you? When was the lasttime i received a mail from you? I guess thats what best friends do.. give up on each other and loose touch. I guess its my fault, I never kept in touch.I miss you Dave, miss you ina way more that you could ever know. I think,wish and pray that you are doing good. You are always doing good.I always felt that I was there for you,just like you were for me ( well more like i just used to drop in in case i needed to speak to you ).Sometimes i see so much in you Dave, you never realize what you are worth, chasing that army dream.. in a way i guess i learnt that from you 'Never give up' its just that i apply it to people. Where were you when i needed you, that day when i hurt , that day when i was lost , that day when i called. Is this the way we are to part?  To C(the only person who can call me silly, and bring a smile on my face): Where do i start C? I miss you as much as i miss dave, except that you arent real.Will we ever meet? I dont know the answer to that. I miss you C,I can be a hopless romantic fool for you, i can be your anything. I'll acheive it for you.You wont realize if what they say behind every man there is a woman ... that woman behind me is you C.I cant explain the way I feel about you. i dont know if its love.. cos i guess have never felt love .. ive felt pain .. but never felt love .I'm dumb sheesh. To you i'll always be that 3rd grader and you always be my favorite teacher. dont ou ever feel lonely, cos you will always have my love , my wishes and my prayers. All I ever want to be is by your side. Be there when you cross the finish line of the triaths.Be there when yer asleep, be there to catch your tears before they fall on the ground, be there so that you will never hurt again.[please dont sigh if you read this or bite your lip ]. You are my world, even though you;d never feel the same about me.  To Angel: You've always been there angel. I hope that we never loose in touch. You are my guardian angel .In a way shielded me from the pain , smiled when i was happy. Sometimes i see myself in you. Were you sent by the heavens ..? Sorry for all the times I've been bossy with you pushing you to do things, I dont like seeing you sad angel and I dont like seeing you loose hope . Sometmes how i wish that you;d get out of that sad town and move to a different place and start again, but as megadeth says  " Moving on is a simple thing , What it leaves behind is hard " . You will over come some day angel , against all odds. Its just going to take a while.I'll be there Angel. We have been through a lot havent we, im glad that we met angel, cos if we hadnt I'm sure i'd have broken by now.Everytime C said sleep tight with real angels, i used to smile, cos i know that some where out there among the Adirondack Mountains, near Long Lake i have an angel to watch over me when I sleep .  To Mum : thank you for bearing with me, cos if i had a son like me i;d have kicked him out of the house and let him suffer all alone.I;d ba happier alone no one to worry about . Crib and writher about the way life treated me and shit like that.

      Who ever said that didnt concider the prevaling environment that a person would be in. The stress,pressures and factors that are applied on an individual that inhibit the amount of success/failure that he can acheive. Some call it chance, others opportunities and some others fate.No matter how hard an individual tries he never acheived the results that he sets out to acheive. nothing ever dne goes right he first time , on successive reattemts lead to further rejections. How many rejections can an individual take? Even simple tasks have to be redone atleast twice to make them work right.    Nothing i have ever done has worked right the 1st time. none of the tasks undertaken have gone smoothly. I have aways thought that thats the way life is , more fun when things dont go right. I guess im gettng to the end my patience tolerence factor. whos the blame God or me ?

      I think i had more dreams of her today. why did she tell me the other day not to worry about her? I knwo that shes got some one else to care for her ., is that why?  Why am i still liking her , i must try and stop liking her cos she now belongs to her soulmate Mark. i cant have these feelings for some one whos taken . Im trying not to. she does'nt have the same feelings for me as i do for her. I just want to get away from everything, wantto get away and start all over again.   My lifes not going the way i want it to, not even in the slightest bit . im F**ked.&nbsp; I cant stop mssing her. These weired feelings. Get up and live ina daze, i dont want it to be this way C&nbsp; .Life feels empty.

      Still cant seem to get her out of my mind. How can you be there for some one whos already taken . Its wrong   Before i hit the sack i think of her . I had 2 dreams about her this morning, about me meeting her ( why me ?) .. sometimes things dont work the way you owntthem to .I guess i must lean to accept the consequences.&nbsp; I mean she's happy.. thats what really matters, not how i feel. Aint easy trying to be there for some one as a friend whom you like them a whole lot more.   Why did you ask me to be there for the wedding C. You know that i wont. Dont think i;d be able to hold myself if i were there.   Still have so many plans for, i wonder if they'd ever take off. I mean somethings are worth it, i do have a reason to live.. maybe i'd never tell you about it . as much as i want to, im not real to you. I can tell you stuff, but i cant make you feel.   Wonder if we'd never walk along the wall of berlin, wonder if we'd go to all those pretty places I dont want to go alone, In a way i nevr alone cos i carry you with me, a memory  A man without hope. that will never be me, i'll always have hope ... its got me this far. I may have never accomplished a lot in life.. ive been there for ppl , ive been there when some one needed me ... i not destined for greatness or anything ,. im that silly sidekick , who'd always be there.

      All good things ome to an end. The monsters were vanquished, the princess met her long lost prince and they lived happily ever after. C's gonna meet up with Mark.&nbsp;Its gonna work out ,as much as i dont want it to i cant wish for that. She's happy, that what matters. Peoples happiness matters. Isnt that want utiopia is all about, other ppl who matter. The individual must make sacrifices so that people are happy . This is my personal utopia.Where the people in my world are happy. Im slowly accepting who i am , accepting how and why&nbsp;Athan's son never got married. did he fall in love with some one whom h coud never have ? i dont knw. i have deamons to face ... i just want ppl to look back nd say that they have had some one by their side through their tough times. i'll be forgotten though ina&nbsp; few tyears , who 'll remember me ?My real friends dont.&nbsp;   People are gonna come and go , some ppl make an impact on how i live my life, in a very very big way i'll always love them for that.Loves a big word, but thats the only word that wuld describe the way i feel about them. If i have to &nbsp;give my life away for them, i will. (im expendable )   Coming back to the main issue , a broken heart bleeds.I know what love is.&nbsp;I know what hurt is ,but i still dont know what happiness is . I kow how i feel when i see someone online , a brief flutter of the heart , i hold my emotions &nbsp;put on a smile and try and be happy for her . Its working, except when she says dont worry about me... as much as i dont want to i still do . Shes got someone to catch her, i wont be required now.   Like i said all stories come to an end, this one is slowly drawing close. I guess its time for me to move on. I dont expect any rosy fields, or green plains.To me it really doesnt matter , just another failure added to my long list. failed&nbsp;yet again. &nbsp;   I&nbsp;dont knwo what to say anymore . ive been rambing i dont know what to put on here anymore.&nbsp; Yes i asked&nbsp; god to keep her happy. I'm sure he will .&nbsp;I knew how it will end .   This is the last i'll see of you C.Our road trippin will never happen, well i dont want it to happen for your sake . I wont be sad, it will be good to know that you are being treated well and that you are happy.   [i dont knwo what to type anymore, its like i've given up on everything ]   Homeward aho. A place where i can make the second person happy( hopefully) . ( Is that lie ? )   She still doesnt know how i feel about her , we said that well meet up and road tripp in 5 years if things dont work out for her . 5 years is a long time , i should&nbsp;know. lives get set right in&nbsp; 5 years.   Thus we parted, and in me is left no emotion to describe the way i feel&nbsp;.  i feel strained, the sky still looks blue,  the grass green and the pale colors all look the same.  The foods still hasnt regained&nbsp; taste,  but somethings missing ..... something that adds life to all this, is missing .   Today is a new day , a new beginning for someone .........and this is to her everlasting happiness.

       She at last sent me a few messages she’s doing well. ( in a way im glad).I've got a heavy heart though. Life’s funny isn’t it? When you aren't around, everyone seems to be happy. Want to leave this place behind, I guess I’m still here because of Angel. I just want her to be on her own two feet. C&nbsp;will be able to manage she's&nbsp;happier when I’m not around. &nbsp;I wonder how my parents are doing too. My mums probably missing me. I wonder if I’m gonna be showered with kisses when i get back home.  &nbsp;  Dave’s online, just sent him a quick hi message.&nbsp;He's doing well. [that was an hour and a half ago , no reply yet form Dave] . Yeah I know how much I’m worth. This was from some one who once said that I’m putting up my price.  &nbsp;  Why is it that i crave for&nbsp;friends and a little recognition?&nbsp;Why is it that I don’t have any real friends. Even back in b'lore ,&nbsp;I always was with Dave none of the others cared. Most of them were hi -bye. Never had any serious relationships or friends. Dave was an odd ball, I guess we were together because he wanted the life that I had (seclusive and where no one took notice of me) and i wanted toe life that he had where everyone knew him and he had so&nbsp;many friends.  &nbsp;  I sometimes wonder if i live in my head. Like Curt Cobain sang “I found God he was in my head". For me its more like, I found&nbsp;friends they are&nbsp;in my head.&nbsp; I guess i just want to belong. Been watching reality shows, and I’m beginning to wonder will a person like me ever really have any friends. leave alone&nbsp; love.&nbsp;I mean how some one can love some one who's not good-looking. Beauty is skin deep. Watching "Average Joe" yesterday, yes I was god smacked. Realizing how ugly i am. Every one picks some one who's good looking. People like me just exist, no matter how much we try and how we are, we don’t get far ahead&nbsp; in life. We are the guys who are picked on, shunned upon; we’re the average Joe’s. Nerds, dweebs, that’s. I still remember getting picked by Rajeev, Sachin, Gautam Menda, was i ever really accepted. Even in Christ College I used to be called crazy, was it my fault for trying too hard for being accepted?  &nbsp;  Tears for remembrance and tears for joy  Tears for somebody and this lonely boy&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Is it enough to just think about god, when some one doesnt even have a dress to wear to go to church ? &nbsp; Still miss her, remember dreaming about deciding to call her up. I call up an operator and ask her if i withold the number, will it still appear on the receivers phone? The operator said that it would if the other person had my number on their list. so i didnt call her up even in my dream &nbsp;  "the heart does not always listen to what the mind wants it to"  forgetting aint easy is it ? &nbsp;

      Michael More, I liked his previous documentary about &nbsp;the Columbine Massacre. This new installment has a&nbsp;healthy dose of Bush Bashing, of which i did get a little tired.&nbsp;It seemed more like a political campaign. Towards the end when Michael More goes around asking Senators to sign up their kids for the army …..umm isn’t it the kids who are supposed to decide ? Which senator would want to speak to Michael More? For all you might know he might secretly be making a documentary on the senator. &nbsp; Still cannot get her out of my mind. I didn’t know that a whole lotta drama, about the election campaign, happened in Florida. Well I did expect Al Gore to win; no I am not politically affiliated to either one of the parties. If you ask me politicians are schmucks. &nbsp; Constantly had this feeling about how did she feel when all these things were happening. I remember when it happened; Anand told me that some one had rammed a plane into the world trade centre and how his friend would be very sad because he loved the World Trade Centre. It didn’t even occur to me that …. woah, its actually a big deal. I remember going home telling dad that some one had rammed a plane into the WTC. It just didn’t matter to me. Should it have? Don’t know. &nbsp; All thought the movie all I wondered as to what C might have been thinking when this happened. How did she react? &nbsp; Was this documentary just a political gimmick? Not a single mention of Blair or the war efforts offered by the Coalition forces. All what he depicted about the war were the horror stories, and the shady side of it. People getting shot and blood and guts spilled all over the victim. I am not that well informed on the war in Iraq, but to me it did sound like a bunch of half truths. It was funny watching Bush not leave the class room in Florida, when he was informed about the attack. Hell, does the president decide? Or do his aides tell him what to do? May be he was told not to do anything and await further orders from his aides. I don’t know, I could be wrong on this. &nbsp; Aren’t you supposed to turn off the camera when people break down? Hell no let it roll; watch ‘em cry, it adds to the effect! Watching a hardened mother who so firmly believed in the army, gets disillusioned when she loses her son. Watching Iraqi women wail and curse, when the bodies of their sons are taken away. When are people gonna realize that war doesn’t solve anything. People like Michael Moore make money by selling half truths. Stupid politicians like Bush condemning American and Iraqi citizens to their death, for whose fault. Was the war fought because of oil or was it a “Wag the Dog” strategy? There were a whole lot of wars in the last decade, the 90;s had so many conflicts in so many countries. All this leads you to ask just a few questions …why. What’s the purpose of life? Why must the innocent suffer? Why do kids get killed? &nbsp; The bottom line about war, no one wants it. Mothers lose a lot during wars, which every side may the sons/daughters be fighting on. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  One of the things about being either under a democracy or under a regime, to an average man is that it doesn’t matter. All that matters is getting 3 square meals a day, making sure that your family has sufficient to eat and the little kids get a proper education, so that when they grow up they might have more money to lead a little more comfortable life. Do politics, regimes, dictators and democracy really matter to an average citizen? Aren’t we all just sheep?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Feel so locked down, I look at the world seems so depressive.. Some times I feel&nbsp; I don’t fit in here .. All I can think of is lyrics from Queensryche's song "There is so much more I can be”&nbsp;Really loud party music slamming in hard from the part hall nearby, every one seems to be having a good time. "Two words that don’t make sense" (to me)&nbsp;Things weren’t supposed to work out this way. &nbsp;I did go to work today, it sucked. but I wasn’t as bored as I was last time. I hate doing omni surveys they always suck. Somehow this time around it wasn’t that bad probably because we had&nbsp;24 minutes of training.&nbsp;&nbsp; Treated myself to a pizza, well as much as I could afford though a 10" margarita, the best I’ve had so far. Don’t know just felt like having one so I did.   I did get to meet the supervisor, got to finish that thing soon and be on my way.   There’s something that still keeps me going,&nbsp;it’s not much but its all I have. One last bit, kinda like the last brown autumn&nbsp;leaf clinging onto a tree. It’s all I’ve got, and I’m holding on to it, wishing on it ... I don’t know how it’s all going to turn out.&nbsp;

      I still cant seem to find the urge to move on, have a few things to sort out . Things that will get done by the end of next week   1: Hand in my resignation on Sunday.  2: Pay up my rent by monday  3: Buy tickets by wednesday  4: Wrap up this project by the 8th   Mama i'm coming home , home, home ! ( Do i wanna go home or am i just running away)   I'm at a stage where nothin matters anymore. I guess i'm back to my usual self again. this time around with a heart burn. Ironice isn;t it how one person can make so much of a difference in your life ( is it a choice am i letting myself to beleive this. can&nbsp;these feelings change if i choose not to?)    So many things to do    So many ppl to meet    So many lives to touch    Nothing matters ,    Coz i feel&nbsp;alone without you &nbsp;   Been trying to get hold of my supervisor , he's never there&nbsp;. Blah. My life, sometimes i wonder if things will ever change.   The chat room's been empty too, none of the regs are there. Guess thats the end of my hangout joint.  &nbsp;     Artist : MXPX     Song : You make me, me     &nbsp;  I was lost and then I found you You make my ocean, you make my sky blue  You make me smile You make me sing You make me scream You make me, everything You make me, me

      Gonna have to stop cribbing about how things are in my life and start living. (Yeah right,! try to get a life . something that I haven’t had&nbsp;&nbsp;at all .. till now ?)&nbsp;  Lisa's being nice off late, at least she ain’t being a pain in the rear.   I've never been happier (well I wasn’t exactly happy, more of a sense of relief)&nbsp;to see £69.85 credited into my account. Least i have enough to survive for&nbsp;this month.&nbsp;   My dissertation’s chugging along at a snails pace.   I’ve got work all week, dunno know if I’d go still trying to work out the math’s , so that I can attend only the required number of shifts and stay there and &nbsp;without getting chucked out.    urlLink http://obstacle-man.blogspot.com/ &nbsp;  Dread going back home, I’d feel like a loser. I'm kind of getting used to my loneliness and if i do go back I’d have mum and dad around(&nbsp;yep I still live with my folks)&nbsp;.   I still haven’t paid my rent for the month of September&nbsp;or booked tickets, I guess I’m worried that if I book tickets something will crop up.  Got another call from another placement agent, asked me to get back to him once my dissertation's done.   I still haven’t kicked my gaming habit, I’m working on a P2 350 megs 192 MB RAM [ woooo hooooo .. I’m developing .NET apps on it] I cant seem to play Red Fraction (but I did manage to advance from one of the previous stages where I was stuck). I love the geo-mod technology used in the game. The game kind of, works on a 2x AGP card.   My Materialistic Wish List:  1: An XBOX and a Game Cube  2: Red Fraction 1 and 2, Dues Ex 1 and 2&nbsp; and GTA3  3: N gage&nbsp;  4: A reasonably good PC so that I can play DOOM3&nbsp;  5: A Digital Camera&nbsp;  6:&nbsp;A mo-bike&nbsp;   Now, I'm addicted to the pinball machine (read game) that ships along Win XP. Wasn’t long ago when I was addicted to Space Impact II (Yep that old game that shipped with a Nokia 3510i.)     Artist : Blink 182  Song :&nbsp; Sometimes   &nbsp;  Sometimes it seems like all I hope for  just gets thrown down on the floor  and then it seems like you don't love me anymore  sometimes I wish that I could run away  sometimes I wish I just had something to say    [I’m trying really hard not to miss her.]   WOOSh's lifes getting better. Her life and C's life usually head along a parallel path .&nbsp;  I'm not gonna txt C , till she leaves me an offliner or two.I've been staying away form the internet too. Councelling, doesnt really help a lot. You just go there and speak about everything under the sun. I'm beginning to doubt my councellor. I guess I have just attended my last session yesterday.   Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

      C's profile's updated, she didn’t bother leaving me an offliner. Best friends eh? I don’t know... Why is it that i crave for her attention?  Just want to go back home. I guess life never offers us second chances... Are things really beyond our control? I've tried to sort a lotta things but all come back really mucked up. Loosing faith in him ... I believe in him. I guess the way I've been brought up is to believe in him, but its ok to question some of the things that "imposes" on us, but at the end of the day still pray and trust out the judgements that he dolls out so graciously on us.   My food reserve is down to the minimum. Guess there ain’t enough to eat .Have to save up to go back home. Have just enough to pay my rent and buy a ticket home. Lol nothing would be left to eat.   Still trying to figure out how many friends i have. Still trying to figure out how to start living again. May be this time I won’t care for anyone.   I think I’ll go meet the counselor again, at least its some one to speak to. Someone real, I don’t expect him to understand anything; it’s just my way of sorting things out in my life. Still remember going to Dave’s house, just sitting there and asking him a whole lot of questions, he'd have answers to some of them, to &nbsp;others we'd just find an amiable solution. I guess he’s not Dave , he's&nbsp; a 50+ year old man, while flowing beard, kinda reminds me of Gandalf the Grey (except his beard not that long as i imagined it to be)&nbsp;[ not&nbsp;Ian McKellen&nbsp; ]  Where am I heading? All seems so lost and bleak. It’s worse than the British winter. Summer wasn’t meant to be such, but in my case, my &nbsp;real winter is happening during a British&nbsp;summer.    Song : Eyes of a Stranger    Artist : Queensryche    &nbsp;  Is this all that's left Of my life before me Straight jacket memories, sedative highs No happy ending like they've always promised There's got to be something left for me And I raise my head and stare Into the eyes of a stranger I've always known that the mirror never lies People always turn away From the eyes of a stranger Afraid to know what Lies behind the stare {Lies behind my stare}

      Every morning I get up and think of her. Off late I keep thinking that she’s gonna go away. Ironic isn’t it I have the same feelings that she has for Mark, probably in the same magnitude too. Trying to get some one out of your m1nd isn’t easy; I guess having some one by your side is supposed to help. I don’t know what to feel anymore; at least C doesn’t hurt like Dawn did. I don’t know if she loves me, I mean people usually take everything in the wrong sense just because you are nice to them. I guess I did to with C. I took everything in the wrong sense. How I wish that things would be different. Maybe if I run away it will all become ok. Leave this world of the internet behind; take away their names from my list.  Find something to do, like they say what you cant see cant hurt you, so If I don’t see C anymore I wont think of her, she doesn’t see me I wont be a the curse I am to everyone. I bring bad luck to everyone. Mum and dad haven’t had a happy marriage, was it because I was there ?My sister didn’t have a happy teen, wasn’t I there .She’s happy now, she’s got her life and everything’s good for her. Maybe if I just stop speaking to everyone that would make everyone and everything better.  I’ve been with angel for a year nothing’s improved in her life. Life went bad for C after I met her. And Dave, Life wasn’t going his way when I was with him. Maybe if I don’t see him before September, he’ll make it through the army. The day the letter I wrote, reached Dave was the day he got discharged from the army. My mums never been happy, I’ve been around her always.&nbsp;   Holy god this cant be true, can it?  &nbsp; I was on a lookout for accommodation. You kinda expect all the Indians to help, so I went to these bunch of Indians who have taken up a house some where on De Grey street and ask them if I can stay with them for about a month, and I wouldn’t have any problems paying them the desired rent. The guy I spoke to said that I’ll have to take up the matter with their Real Estate Agency, instead of them (I was like WOOOOT . man can ya’ll accommodate me say in the living room for about 3 weeks , damn I was even willing to pay rent … fair enough I guess I’m gonna go back home broke as a duck now. I asked another guy before that and he was like I live in a very small room, and there’s not enough space for himself … (yeah right like its said no one helps, I mean why would they care if I were on the streets , no one cares . no one but family )   &nbsp; NoFx sung a song called “Drugs Are Good” and years later they wrote another song called “Whoops I Od’d”. Ionic ?

      Something is missing. I mean i guess i now understand how she actually felt about me , i was just a friend all along. There were no special feelings . I was just another friend. Her heart belongs to some one else. I cant stand her trying to not say things i want to tell her. im there for her , i'll be down below to catch her if she falls , i hope she doesnt and that shes always happy . Sometimes thats all that matters, her happiness.   I miss her, but isnt it wrong to like someone whos already taken ?

      I did in fact hear from that company, they though that I would be returning on the 11th of august, Replied that d be coming back only on the 11th of Sept. Anyway, I still miss her. Been 2 weeks since I have last spoken to her. I guess that things will be going good for her. I know that we are going to lose in touch , unless she deicide to get back in touch with me. Wonder if anyone really cares about how i feel . Keep thinking for how long am I going to keep wishing that some one would come and save me. The e is no one to come and save me thats the bottom line. Good things like that happen only in the movies not in real life. In real life u get hit and walk on. Paula’s mums in Prague, I wonder if I’d ever get to travel like that . Travel around the word, but doesn't it all boil down to just one thing? Money! "It's all about the money" Planning on visiting Jammu and Kashmir.. prolly in Jan/Feb, before the snow melts . Just don’t want to come back from that trip who know what can happen, a bomb can go off and some really exciting stuff can happen.. If not.. Hell I’d have just visited j and K  we all make plans and work towards them some come through and some fade away plans are reasons, for which we live the hurt, pain and other emotions they bring.  Lisa said that the new housemates are moving in next week and we need to get the house cleaned up by then.  I watched Manoj kinght Shamlyans, Unbreakable. It was weird. A tale of a morden day superhero whos unbreakable literally. I guess it answered qustions about can an ordinary man live a dual life as a father, husband and employee on one hand and a superhero on other. Samuel L Jackson plays this guy who's trying to convince Brucel Wills that hes a superhero.

Got my fingers crossed. The other one is a tester's job in London, sent the recruitment guy my CV, let’s see what he has to say  More rejections on the way I don’t know.

       "Very well.   Just note that it is very hard for IT people to findwork now with some 160,000 unemployed IT workers in the US alone vying forjobs.  We have over 3000 applicants for this position, so you were veryfortunate to have been selected."     I wish I could tell you how unhappy I am, letting that offer go, but I can’t work from home. Not in India where wont get the tools I need (maybe that’s untrue).. The truth is, I wanted to work in LA, even if that meant without pay. I’m not doing it for the money ... well I don’t have anything to work for (that’s a lie. I do try and work towards something, someone)… Anywhere just to be closer to her (if ever there is such a thing called closeness) David, the job didn’t matter it was supposed to be a means to an end. Its unpaid and I cant get to work where I wanted to. Its a boolean AND situation, i was execting a boolean OR .If one OR the other, i;d have chosen it. My only regret is that im soon gonna be further away from her than I want to.  Sent her an email with my permanent address, people loose in touch. Maybe I just want her to send me a letter that’s all. I mean who cares about me. Monique said that she wanted to meet me … she hardly knows me. We barely know each other.  Lisa keeps going on and on about how she’s gonna visit India. I didn’t even bother telling her that she can visit me.  Mum want me to come back to the UK in October, I’m not so sure that I want to. I always end up at the wrong place at the wrong time; say the wrong things at the wrong moment.  I’ve been reading JP’s blog. It looks like he’s settled into a normal life. I don’t know if I’d wanna speak to him. I mean he doesn’t care, who does?  Paula said “ if you are counting on another person to make you happy then it never will be ” I guess I’m still wishing for some one to come and save me.  I guess I’d have lived my life if I do the following 1. Haul my lazy ass to Canada 2. Figure out how to snowboard 3. Get mum to Canada 4. Send my sister a return ticket to any destination in the whole world of her choice (I think she’d want to go someplace in the US of A) 5. Run a mile w/o getting tired 6. Own an X-Box, PS2 and a Game Cube. 7. Do something for the environment (um I could kill myself in the woods, that way I can be useful as manure =)) 8. Meet a whole lotta people whom I’ve spoken to online. 9. Have a whole load of good friends.  [PS if I can achieve all that in 2 years. I can die by the age of 26]

      Sent a check to the travel agents today, asking them to book tickets for the 11th of Sept. Its a return ticket and I may ( dunno I’m not sure of coming back) return on the 11th of October. Still miss her a lot . I haven’t heard form her in almost 2 weeks. I guess she’s happy. AS the saying goes "No news is good news".... I always have this fear "that no news means that some one out there is dead"... that’s just me.  Slowly inching my way towards finishing my dissertation, I’ve been slacking a lot lately... at least there are no problems at home. (Amen to that) I've been speaking  a lot to god, dunno if he ever listens ( i guess u start speaking to god when u are at the verge of giving up on life, hoping that he'd show you the way)  Speaking of home, where exactly is home? I never felt secure within the four walls of my parent’s home, never felt secure at this place where I am in.... Where is home? Isn’t a place where you are to feel secure? Where u can go back and rest your weary bones after a hard day? I wonder where my homes gonna be?  Watched a movie where Christopher reeve plays a paralyzed cop. It was nice movie, but I had this feeling that I had seen it before, because I knew how it was gonna end.  Wonder if my sister thinks of me? Rema doesn’t really care how. Damn I’ll have to meet her if I land in Bombay and listen to all the stuff she’s gonna tell me(oh yeah and wash the vessels when I’m done.. like she once said there’s no such thing as a free meal  ) I like her, but she gets on my nerves. I’m looking forward to see Dave and Aroo.

      Just ANother DAy. Got up at 2 in the afternoon... feel like I’m slipping .. Had random thoughts of her, in my head as soon as i get up, days arent ment to be his way.  I’m still cracking on my thesis. I should start my documentation today .Hell with Pete, I'm gonna show him how much I’ve done till date. I just wanna go back and recover from this shitty phase i am in, and after that who knows. Turkey, Canadia, Australia , J&K or prolly stay in B’lore .. Move away from mum and dad. I dunno.  In other news today, Lisa was being a B***H (again) acting rather rude. .. So I just let her be (was fun ignoring her and not having to listen to stupid remarks being said about me because I was ignoring her) .. guess she was having a shitty day too... was on the phone all day, and watching tele (I'm not complaining). The stupid Git burnt the carpet and wants to blame the Chinese housemates who had stayed here previously. I just nodded my head in affirmation .I'm gonna shift sides depending on the situation.  She touched a raw nerve when she said that we can blame the Chinese for burning the hob. Yeah right, wasn’t she the one who walked in to the accommodation office and told them that i set the kitchen afire , and nagged to Sally’s friends (hell she doesn’t even know them.. they were there just for the night) about me burning the whole place up? Once people are in shit how quickly they forget the past .  Trying to install XP on Virtual PC and hopefully I’d have doom3 downloaded too. More on that later.  * 4 hours later* Damn Virtual PC  emulates a S3 Trio 32/64 [ sheesh ] doom3 doesnt work on that [Sheesh *2]

Never fall for a friend , it never works out. Why is it that im always stuck up as this guy whos there for the moment? Looking back there's nothing that i can look at and say i was happy to do it.    Everything was so crazy I think i was havin fun Lost in your arms I was living a dream  Till i heard you say he's back All the same feelings that You had for him in the past I let go and try getting over with          No body wants to be stuck with a loser like me.

That sounds like Dio.... lmao and he suddenly starts sing "his names Dio, Ronnie James Dio". Simple things amuse simple m1nds..... i guess. It sure did make me feel better. I’m now sitting here with a stupid grin on my face.  Guess this year's been the year of Punk for me. At least I Fund something happy-sad-mellow-snappy to listen to, to keep me going on.  While i was biking to school, I kept thinking as to why I need women in my life. All I’ve ever got from them is hurt.. hurt by everyone. I guess i have this script buried deep inside that's always told me to stay away from people, I guess that’s why I’m am so .. I don’t know.  Still searching for a job, nothing seems to be working out. I've been applying no more replies. I applied for an internship in Turkey through AEISEC, it’s a .NET job. I still haven’t heard from them. The Chinese internship is gonna work out to be too very expensive I can’t afford it. The job from B'lore has been put on hold, till I get back. Knowing my luck, it would have been filled up when I get there.  Haven’t done any work, by the time I decided to do something I found out that i have the wrong version with me [sheesh me], Heading home, hopefully I may do some work done. I think I will show Pete as much as I’ve finished so that I can start the documentation process and be done with it soon.

      Saw her in an extreme sports room today. I wasn’t expecting to see her .. She left as I popped into the room. I mean why? C I wont say i love you when your heart belongs to some one else... at least the feeling's diminishing... I guess that it will  all fade away, someday.  As Melina said "I just have to let this crush die away ... like all the other ones".  Times you just want to be comforted, but there's no there. I want something to hold on to , some where to belong to. A deep yearning for some sense of belonging, wishing that some one some where can hear these silent screams.  Sometimes i wonder if all we ever want is a little bit of security. Was reading some guys blog about traveling alone , and read a comment posted by another reader .. she had said that its no fun travelling alone, cos there no one to share the good moments with . (That’s true happened to me when i was in London ... traveling alone is worse)  Cant afford tickets for the Dio concert , I mean i can always ask mum for a small loan because I wont be getting paid till a much later date, I just don’t want to. AS much as I want to go, I wont.  At least Whoosh still sees and speaks to me online. None of my other peers do. [ i don’t know what to write .... i just feel so numb ... ]  Lisa was being a B***h today telling me to buy stain removal liquid because her £35 skirt has grease stains on it, something tome me. better to take the easier path and not argue .  Somewhere deep down inside my m1nd I have this feeling that I’m a pushover doll for everyone. Like I end up taking the blame when she’s drunk and decides to fall on my bike. I need to stop being nice to people. People who are rude are less likely to be hurt I guess. Wonder how Viren's doing. God usually keeps ppl like him happy.  The past year seems like a bury haze especially this year .I have so many good things to look back on last year, I wonder if it was the best ever in my life.  Worried about angel too, In away she’s all I got and i cant seem to help her find her way back. Shes addicted to her depression meds. She doesn’t seem to want to do anything. She told me her house is a mess. i know how she feels, cos that’s how i feel .. but then again i cant help her. If i had one wish, I'd make it on her. She deserves another chance .  Didn’t do any work on my thesis yesterday. I have a demo on Monday, I’ll have to ask Pete to have a look at it on Friday . Going to clench my fists, I’ve got to bear this just for 3 more weeks after that I’m outta here.   Out into the unknown, not knowing where    I’d goThe roads they all seem alike    A lone stranger I roam hoping to find a purpose   So with a sense of accomplishment I can die.   Deep down inside I keep wishing that the aircraft I'm gonna be flying in is taken over by chechnian terrorists and hope I get killed ( but thats selfish just cos i wanna die . others needn't ) Its probably because its been hammered down mythroat that suicide is a bad thing and that your soul never makes the transition .. and you'll end up stuck here as a ghost (who'd wanna take such a chance?... you wouldn't not if you are a beleiver) So I guess its ok to get killed rather than take my own life away. I know someday i'll find a reason to live and by then my days will be numbered., till then i'll have no will to live, but i;;l exist.   I cant make a difference, Im not good enough ....   To anyone who actually reads this... my life’s boring for now, I’ll change it .. I will make it more interesting. I still have about 5 years of life left in me. ( I believe that after 30 life’s as good as over ... responsibilities start creeping in)  I still have random thoughts about being a dad. I don’t want a father a daughter, but a son. (Knowing me that might change, I’ll want a daughter when (IF) i have a son).  Watched Ali G on TV yesterday, He’s STUPID. The only thing good about the entire show was when he kept rapping "Ali in the island, Ali in Northern Ireland” .. With Drum and Base in the back Ground (the clip was about 10 seconds long)

      Got cracking on my dissertation , its 75% done, still have to start the report. Not seeing her online is helping, least i dont think of her so often as i used to .. but then again i still miss her. spoke to her the other day, it felt like something was missing. I guess its time for me to move on ( or move away?)  Dont expect anything to happen to me now i\ll be heading back home soon . Telling everyone that im happy to go back, but the truth is that, i dont want to go back  there is still  so much to do and so mauch to see. it cant end this way  can it ... time will tell . None of the job companies have replied .  WOOSh's havin the time of her life. I still havent heard from Dave.   Song blurry   Artist Puddle of Mudd   Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake and everybody's empty and everything is so messed uppre-occupied without you I cannot live at allMy whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl You could be my someone you could be my scene you know that i'll protect you from all of the obscene I wonder what you're doing imagine where you are there's oceans in between us but that's not very far Can you take it all away /snip/  Everyone is changing there's no one left that's real to make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel cause I am lost without you I cannot live at all  my whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl  Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake and everybody's empty and everything is so messed up pre-occupied without you I cannot live at all My whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl You could be my someone you could be my scene you know that i'll protect you from all of the obscene I wonder what you're doing imagine where you are there's oceans in between us but that's not very far Can you take it all away /snip/  Everyone is changing there's no one left that's real to make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel cause I am lost without you I cannot live at all  my whole world surrounds you I stumble then I crawl

      The other women billionaires ..... Akki .... worth Rs 675 crore (Rs 6.75 billion). [pulled that off from the rediff website]  Billion ... thats a Big number .  Still remember her waving a copy of dataquest (i think) with her dads pic on it on the cover way back in 1996, when we were in PUC. I still remember having that feeling , ok so what if his pic is on the cover of a mag ? (notta lotta stuff interest me .. in some ways i still havent changed )  I guess thats why I never wanted to work for that company....... damn now i know why i never wanted to work there .. cos i had made a resoultion that i wouldnt work there . lol ... phew its a releif whe u suddely remember stuff . I didnt think t was right for me to work under my peer. weird how your m1nd thinks when yer a 16 year old . Imust admint that i did go for an interview , but i didnt get selected ( yeah i cursed god for a while .. cos i needed a better paying job at that juncture... looking back, i cant explain it.. i guess sometimes wishes do come true )

      Have so much to say today; just don’t feel like putting my thoughts to words. She left me a few off liners ... didn’t expect her to. She has this uncanny knack of popping up every now and again just when I seem to think I’m over it. Will we always friends C? If I vanish someday ... Will you find me? I try not to think of you C. Believe me I don't want to think of you, because every time I do, I still think someday that we'll meet ,some day things will be as us when clearly there is (was , start with in the 1st place) no us.  Keep having this weird thought of leaving everything behind and going away.Probably one of those strife or crime filled places ..like Phalestine, Iraq, Afghanisthan, Turkey or any of the south American countries.i can take physical pain .. its the emotional women related ones that I cant handle.  I don’t feel like speaking to anyone off late. I just want to alone. I’m not downstairs when Lisa is in the house; I kind of keep telling her that I’m stuck with a problem that I can’t fix... So I can get away acting as though I’m sulking... It gives me lots of space. Its contradictory emotions, wherein you wanna be alone, but you don’t wanna be alone.  I guess that I’m just gonna try and wait these 3 weeks and be done with it. I think I look forward to going home as a way of recouping...in a way I dread going back home.  There is nothing there, besides Mum, which is more like I have to do it because she's Mum.

       It doesn't really matter now   how the world can go... cos i have lost all    more that you ever know      You were all i had   Thought i had put all my bad dreams in the past    And the fun times were to last ....    Save me...      Save me...  [come on and]   Save me...  [come on and]   Will you come and save me from the mess I'm in ?      It doesnt really matter now,    Where i go.. The further from you the better they say    But I dont wanna head home       So can i come to you?   Will you hold me close  and ease the pain away ?   Maybe the fun times.. this time will last
