      Wow, today was Morgan's fourteenth birthday. The party was really great! We had pizza and chips and coke. Luke did some stupid stuff that could have gotten us in alot of trouble, but hell, who cares? We all ran around and yelled and crazy stuff, like Rich and myself's pants went a little low. Becca's finger was licked by me, and Rich nearly blew up. It was hillarious. Then when me, PeeWee, Luke, and Alex H. all were throwing pool balls across a table, one flew and hit me square in the place-of-immense-pain-and-pleasure. It was all great though and we all had fun, even though Aaron wasn't invited!

      (Some of you QUEEN fans might recognize that reference in the title...hope you do)  Today I discovered great new song on my Queen CD A Night At The Opera, The Prophet's Song. I love it. I can't get enough of it, even though it is 8 minutes and 21 seconds long. It is a great rhapsody, kinda like Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Led Zepellin's Stairway to Heaven. It is kinda confusing. I think it may have something to do with Christ...though I am not entirely sure what the hell it means - I only know it is great.  Today was a great day. I actually got along with my sister and enjoyed her company! This morning for an hour or so, we listened to music in the Reading/Music Room. It was really cool. We kinda talked about how we both like classic rock. I am proud of her. Then we went to lunch because I was in a good mood and guess what! We actually had fun! I couldn't believe it.  I got through 100 pages of my last summer reading book: A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Even though I kinda used unethical methods - and going behind my mother's back methods - I am not to worried. I told one of my friends something today. It was taken kinda much worse than I hoped it would, but Oh well.  [Blank]  will get over it pretty damn soon, even though  [blank]  might think me kinda funny about it.

      I finnaly finished my second Summer Reading book:  Cold Sassy Tree.   It was great.  It actually had a meaning, and was very sad...I could have cried.  It taught me alot of things that usually aren't taught.  It taught me about life and death.  It taught me about lifein general.  I know it may only be a book, but it showed me overwhelming happiness and sadness.   Today, I discoverd that if you eat a potatoe and then leave the plate with the crumbs on it, it hardens like a rock!  Wow, I guess you learn something new everyday!   I didn't go to the YMCA today for a few reasons.  One is that I slept in, but that is because I told my mom I am not going to the Y today.  Another is I am tired of devotiong myself to something so dead-end and uncaring.  The people are great, but I don't think I really want to work for LIT any more, where I pay them to work Nine to Five...but don't get paid!  I do more work for the Y then any Bus boy/bag boy prick so I to should get paid some or at least not have to pay them!  And it turns out that out of the eight of us, I am the only one to pay full price!  A few didn't pay at all and some were on "Y Welfare" or whatever the hell that is.

      Today is the last Monday of the Summer...and man, that sucks.  But actually it is really good, because I am going to a great High School and I can't wait to meet all my new friends, even though I am gonna miss my other friends like crazy, but unlike some of them, I have confidence our friendships will last.  I am still talking to people I have known and haven't seen in awhile, so I know things can work.  Today I have been reading Summer Reading like crazy!  And man, I am almost done with Cold Sassy Tree...then I have to read A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (sorry all you conn. people about spelling conn. wrong).  Hopefully I'll be done with it all by thursday or Friday.  Then on Saturday I'll write my notes on the book...urgh the thought of it all...  Right now I am listening to a great band...The Killers.  I have only heard two songs, but I already love them.  They sing "Mr. Brighside" and "Somebody Told Me", those both are two of the greatest songs I have heard in a long time.  I already want their CD "Hot Fuss".  They are from the UK, so they have a British background and sound...so I like it all.

      Title:  I dunno, I am listening to Franz Ferdinand, and I like the song Dark of the Matinee.  Speaking of Matinee, I went to one today.   Alien vs. Predator.  Whoo who.  What a gay ass excuse for a movie.  Anyway, I am kinda disapointed in one of my friends.  I am now doubting if  [blank]  tells the truth to me.  I think I caught  [blank]  in a lie, but I am not sure.  I might confront  [blank]  later about it and get the real story.  It is disapointing.  Also I finished Draft Three of my screenplay currently titled The Abduction of Four.  I guess it is a good script, I have had it screened with some people, they all liked it except one.  He hates it.

      Wow, nothing has really happened in my life that is so crazy.  I am getting sick of the YMCA, where I volunteer.  I am tired of working my ass of from 9 to 5 and not getting paid, but instead paying them!  It is really hard, and gets really annoying when I could be out having fun somewhere else.  So I am thinking of just quitting and getting a job or something, I really need the money nowadays.  Anyway, Aaron and I went and saw Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle.  It was great, just check out my website for the review of it:   urlLink http://www.freewebs.com/mylifeisupsidedown/

      I never really thought of it this way until I heard the song '39, but I realized that the end of the feel-good world was over.  It took 50 years more of fear for the collapse of the USSR for the feel good times to start up again.  But then on Sept. 11, 2001 our world was again plunged into turmoil.  And now the world is turning grey and the darkness is spreading.  There are so many forces acting that how can we know who will win?

       At least 11:59 is when I started typing this. I dunno what to say. I need to finish Summer Reading for High School! Tomorrow I have an easy day at the YMCA so I'll be able to finish at least one book hopefully. Opps it just turned 12:00. Anyway, I don't know what to say besides:  Check out my website! The Link is on my profile, so get your ass over there.  Oh yea, it just turned 12:02. Bye.

      Oh man, today I had to go to a SC equivelent to Chuckie-E-Cheese, Gatti Town.  Wow.  That was crazy dumb.  I had to meet some kids with my freind, but they didn't exactly wanna talk with us to much.  I am not gonna worry though, because they are going to a diffrent school than me.  They seemed nice, but not interested in me and my freind to much.  We would talk and they would walk.  But it is alright in the end.

      Well today I had a few interesting revelations from a few of my freinds. One, revealed she may not exactly be a model for total sanity (sorry, but I had to say it). Another revealed that he is slightly jealous of me, which is ironic, because I am usually jealous of him. Anyway, I watched the movie Resvoir Dogs, and as you know I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan, so seeing his first movie was great. It was pretty good but very, very bloody.

      Today I finnaly watched a long anticipated film, Pulp Fiction.  After alot of arguing with my parents, they finnaly caved and allowed me to rent the classic movie, which was excellent.  I know none of this is really important, but I just had to tell the world how great it was.  My favorite director, Quentin Tarantino has done a great job.   QT Films:  Resovoir Dogs:  Haven't seen Pulp Fiction:  5 stars Jackie Brown:  4 stars Kill Bill Vol. 1 :  5 stars Kill Bill Vol. 2: 5 stars
