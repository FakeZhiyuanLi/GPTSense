      Kubanske rytmar kan h�yrast i Montparnasse p� livlege kveldar i Paris. I Tel Aviv vert Buena Vista vist heile tida. Europearar drikk den kubanske cocktail El Mojito: Sitron blanda med kubansk rom med peparmynteblad. Over heile verda st�r kubanske sigarar utstilt p� butikkhyller, og svenskar og kanadiarar g�r rundt og viser fram fargen dei har f�tt i Karibien.  i miss norway =(

      hi. i am quite bored. jasper is at his clarinet lessons, holly is well, here. and i have no one to talk to. i suppose i could talk to holly but she doesn't seem too interested. muffin, holly's dog is on my leg right now. i always try to politely kick him off but i end up either flying him across the room, or just scooting him over a bit. i have no patience for poodles. or whatever the hell kind of dog he is. i phoned mumma today. she said all is well and that libby misses me. what about frank? he doesn't miss me? well, i miss him... i wonder how madison and all my pals are doing... i should send them all a little postcard, or an e-mail. or letter. i still haven't told anyone about my kiss. i most certainly do not want austin or jay to know. maybe i'm just shy. i have always had a little crush on them, but not as much as elan. you know, i bet madison and aria and anna will tell them anyway... i wonder when jasper will be home!!!!! ??? he's my favourite cousin. by far. we're so much alike. 2 years apart but we get along great. he's a funny kid. not too posh, not too scruffy. actually he is quite scruffy. reminds me of his dad. good old uncle rob. a typical englishman. the kind that drinks beer, and...stuff. i just asked aunt jane what time jasper would be home. she said 5:30 or so...10 more minutes of waiting. she said i should take muffin for a walk... damn...! well, that's it for now.   jasper, come home early so i don't have to walk your ugly ass of a dog!!!

      today was possibly the best day of my entire f-ing life. wow. me, jasper, rosie, joss, and elan (yummy) all went to the nearest park down the road. i wore my black blazer with my purple scarf. oh and my jeans... elan said i looked fit. ha ha ha. we all rolled down the hill and i fell and ripped my pants. at the same time i scraped my knee and it started to bleed. it was quite embarrassing, but then elan kissed me...yes i know!!! kissed! wow. it was my first kiss. =) and i loved it. it was the perfect day too. it was misty and cool, yet still warm. ahhh...i officially love elan. before i wasn't so sure. he is so hardcore. i love that in a guy. but the kiss was a little embarrassing because my cousin was sitting right there! i hope he doesn't tell all of his posh little friends who have crushes on our group. or aunt jane and uncle rob. oh dear. but it was nice. elan is a good kisser, i must say. later on today we went to get chips. yummm. well, i am officially in love and officially, "out". peace
