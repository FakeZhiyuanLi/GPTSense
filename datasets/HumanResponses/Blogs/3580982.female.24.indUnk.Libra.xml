      I just returned from a slothful vacation near Table Rock Lake.  My husband and I met up with my sister and our folks.  We played Settlers of Katan (the Knights and Cities version), read read read (I read Mansfield Park), watched multiple movies, walked while conversing, and ate.  It was delightful.  Let me confess my ignorance of copying CD's via Windows Media Player.  This is something I've just began to play with, and in the process have rediscovered some great songs which were previously trapped on lame-o CD's.  Songs such as VOL's "Wondering Where the Lions are" and Sixpence None the Richer's "The Ground You Shook."  These songs used to live on a dreadful mixed CD entitled "Roaring Lambs."  Don't buy it.  Don't even think about buying it.    Okay, I must go and concoct dinner.  Tonight we will have some sort of salmon with a big salad.  I think I may experiment with a maple glaze.  I feel like living on the edge tonight.

      Last night there was a solid rain--gentle wind, lightning, rumbling thunder, the works.  It was the best sort of storm.  I woke up contented several times through the night.  I watched "Reality Bites" for the first time ever last night.  What a great flick.  It's one of the movies that makes you feel more like you really are a part of the experience of humanity.  We just bought the anniversary addition, and there's some good extra stuff.    I made some killer biscuits for lunch today--these look and taste like the kinds that come out of a can.  (So why not just make them out of a can, you ask?  I dunno--I guess I enjoy those "dang, those were good" warm fuzzy feelings.)  Here it goes...this is from a stripped extra copy of Cook's Illustrated that I picked up from the Bookstore I work for--the silly magazine suppliers always send waaaaaay too many copies of everything.)   Dang Good Buttermilk Biscuits     Dough   2 cups (10 ounces) flour 1 T double-acting baking powder 1 T sugar 1 t salt 1/2 t baking soda 4 T cold unsalted butter, cut into smallish chunks 1 1/2 cups cold low-fat buttermilk    stuff for forming the biscuits   1 cup flour, distributed in a rimmed baking sheet 2 T melted butter  1. Put oven rack in the middle of the oven.  Heat to 500 degrees.  Spray 9-inch round cake pan with nonstick cooking spray.  Spray inside and out of a 1/4 cup measuring cup with nonstick spray.  2. TO MAKE THE DOUGH:  In a food processor (or with a patience and a fork), pulse flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and baking soda to combine, about six quick pulses.  Scatter butter chunks over dry ingredients; pulse until mixture resembles pebbly, coarse cornmeal, eight to ten quick pulses.  Transfer mixture to a medium bowl; add buttermilk and stir.  (Batter will be wet and slightly lumpy.)  3. TO FORM & BAKE BISCUITS:  Using the coated 1/4 cup measuring cup to quickly spoon out a level amount of dough--drop this in the flour-covered baking sheet.  Roll it around, shake off extra dough, and then put it in the cake pan.  Line the outer ring of the cake pan with biscuits first, and then put the final biscuits in the center.  Gently brush the melted butter on the tops (don't squish them!).  Bake 5 min, reduce temperature to 450 degrees, and then bake til the biscuits are very golden brown, about 15 minutes.  Cool in pan 2 minutes, dump the pan over.  Turn all the biscuits right side up, break them apart and let them cool 5 more minutes before devouring.  (Letting them cool those last five minutes really does keep your biscuits from being soggy.)  That's all for now...

      Because food is a key part of life.  I'm by no means a foodie, but I like to slow down enough to enjoy what I'm eating . . . I love to feed people good food and spoil friends with a feast.  When you eat a meal with someone, you are living out an essential element of community.  When I ask others to eat something I've made, I'm inviting them, even if in a small and simple way, to be a part of my life, and taking a risk that they won't like my creation (especially when you consider some of the things I make!).  So a recipe finds meaning in my blog in part because I think it's dang tasty, but also because more than likely, it's been a part of interaction with other folks.  Take the hummus again--hummus is a food that forces a level of intimacy because it is difficult to eat gracefully.  You scoop it onto a pita chip, and inevitably a bit dribbles off the edge.  Hummus is not a stuffy food.  There's only so boring a person can be and eat hummus at the same time.

      I am a personal trainer--most of my clients are women in their 20's-50's who are trying to lose 10-20 pounds and do something good for their bodies.  The other female trainers at my gym are cut, tan, and incredibly strong.  I approach lifting from the standpoint of a dancer (this is my excuse for being a little scrawny when it comes to my muscles).  Today I think I overkilled my shoulders.  Grrr.  It is strange to be in an occupation so extremely focused on external appearances.  I would much rather have a stranger notice what book I'm presently reading than what my arms look like.  But honestly, that in itself is another form of vanity, not more glorious just because it is cerebral instead of physical.    On the menu for lunch?  Honeydew melon.  And crackers and cheese (try the new Kashi TLC "tasty little crackers" ---wow.  That's a fantastic cracker).  Anyone else irked that disc two of Buffy season 6 is not working??

      Welcome to my blog.    This will be a brain dumping quagmire of thoughts and process, recipes and literature, political quirks and cultural ahas.  We'll see how far I get.  Today's recipe:   Sun Dried Tomato Hummus  1 can chickpeas, rinsed and drained 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes in flavored oil 1/2 t kosher salt 1/4 t freshly ground pepper 1/4 c water 2 cloves o' garlic a squeeze of fresh lemon juice  Dump everything into a blender or food processor, blend, and eat with oven-browned whole wheat pita slices, tomato, and cucumber.  Yum.  I'm eating this at this very moment.
