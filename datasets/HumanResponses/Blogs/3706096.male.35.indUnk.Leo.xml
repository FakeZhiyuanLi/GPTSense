      Perhaps I should identify what my background is regarding the topic addressed in the assigned reading before voicing MHO (my humble opinion.) In 1999 I was happily employed, but as a consequence I also had no social life.  To make myself feel better I turned to a program called ICQ (an instant messaging program like Yahoo messenger or MSN messenger.) After spending several months talking to hundreds of different people, I happened across a rather charming female who I quickly became friends with.  With in three months of meeting online she flew to where I was so we could meet.  With in the next year of several extended visits I decided to leave my job and my country to live with this female in Mexico City. I learned a lot from that relationship (I lasted a year in Mexico City, but unforeseen cultural differences caused the relationship to implode,) and developed my own judgments on cyber-romance.  The author does a fine job of generalizing the rather complex world of online communication, but avoids talking about the instant messaging clients and the rapid-fire communication they invoke. I do believe however, that common sense and IRL (in real life) social norms should apply to the online world.  If you wouldn’t say something to someone’s face, then what justifies it to be said online. BTW, I’ve found that most who fit into the author’s category of “virtual anarchists” in instant message land, are in fact angry teenage males, regardless of their actual age, that is how they come across.

      A question was presented today that is worthy of addressing here;  What function in a culture does religion fill?  Since the beginning of time man has struggled with that which he does not understand.  From that point forward the way man has rationalized these non-understood events is to blame them upon some natural unseen, super natural, spiritual, godly force.  This way of thinking developed into religion.  Religion is what humans have relied upon for answers to questions that are beyond current understanding.  Questions like, what happens when you die, why did these events happen, and what can I do to ensure the safety of my loved ones. Many great thinkers have stated in the past that this belief in the supernatural would disappear with time, education, or wealth, contrary to that belief however, we live in the most educated and wealthy society that the world has ever seen, but, arguments over values that differentiate religious systems cause wars to this day, religion continues to play a predominate roll in politics and societies morals still revolve around basic precepts developed within the code of the religions. Today, religion provides the frame work in which people attempt to control gods will through prayer, moral living, and attending religious services.  Religion provides a comfort zone for those grieving over the loss of a loved one, by allowing the living family to look forward to seeing the deceased in heaven when they too die. Religion is also used as the last stop for hope.  People who are in the greatest need, turn to god and pray for salvation; Salvation not just of their soul, but also of their happiness and in many cases their monetary situations.

      The internet has proven it’s self as wonderful recourse for specialty items.  These niche marketers are able to find the individuals through out the country and the world who seek their unique items.  People who are inclined to agree with the extremist views of hate groups are thankfully a rare breed; the internet allows these groups an inexpensive avenue to preach their words to those unique few who will listen worldwide.  The greatest weakness in the argument presented in Brasher’s book  Give Me That Online Religion  is the movements she fails to address.  The most paramount of those are the sites devoted to promoting the religion or belief of hate.  Stormfront, the KKK, and several other groups hate consider themselves religious organizations; these groups quickly embraced the internet, realizing the enormous audience they could potentially teach their rhetoric of hate.   Brasher discounted fanatical groups as mostly harmless and short lived.  Hate groups, which would categorically fit under fanatical groups, but were left unmentioned.  Are we to believe that Matthew Hale’s World Church of the Creator* would avoid a domain recognizing that organization as a religious organization?  Brasher’s argument was for a reserved domain for religion.  To implement this is problematic.  If we reserve a domain, like .gov for government and .edu for education institutions, for religion some sort of standard will need to be developed to determine who will qualify.  How do we judge who is a religion, do we use the country of origins standards?  Do we only allow established religions with more then a hundred, a thousand, or a hundred thousand members?  Do we allow whomever claims to be a religion to qualify?  Sadly, Brasher did not address hate groups nor, for that matter, any religion who preaches violence.  This omission is a logical error that can not be ignored.  *According to an FBI press release issued June 9th of this year, Matthew Hale has been convicted for plotting a federal judge’s murder, sentencing is in August with a maximum sentence of 50 years.

      Thesis: Rather then condemn the internet for this “whiteness,” it becomes evident to the scholar of communication that the centricism of the internet is a continuation of the unifying process that started with the printing press.  The paper argues that the regional (national) changes caused by the printing press in the 1600’s is equivalent to the change being propagated by the internet, with the exception being the change is on a global scale.  The paper rejects the notion of “whiteness,” arguing that when several hundred regional dialects of Europe were refined into national languages, the aggregate effect was to streamline communication, which in effect produced a solidifying of national boundaries, If your neighbor’s all speak French, then you living in France.

      The video “Game Over,” was at best an entertaining program.&nbsp; It focused in upon a small by sensational segment of the multi billion dollar computer entertainment market.&nbsp; Providing only one prospective of computer gaming culture, the video is unforgiving placing blame directly upon the developers of the games.&nbsp; Regardless the video overlooked the huge segment of computer games that are non-violent and disregarded the market successes or failure of the games addressed in the video.  The successes or failure of a game motivates the market to adjust.&nbsp; A super successful game will cause other game developers to attempt to develop a better version of a similar concept.&nbsp; Failure will and has caused entire genres to disappear from store shelves.&nbsp; Another point the video did not address is that other media is also becoming more realistic and more explicit in depictions of violence.&nbsp; Even in sports, the camera seems to zoom in closer rather then pan out when a player becomes hurt.  News media and some academics have always found fame in looking at fringe behavior and addressing it as if it is the norm.&nbsp; In the mid 80’s the television program 60 minutes did a report on the evils of the roll playing game Dungeons and Dragons.&nbsp; In that report the program presented several stories of individuals who took the concept too far attempting to practice magic, worship devils, etc.&nbsp; It is true, Dungeons and Dragons may be a criminal waste of time, but very few individuals actually attempt to bring the fantasy world into reality.  The maddening fact of this sort of reporting is that the reporters seem to think that rather then presenting the story evenly, that the public needs to be lead in the proper direction.&nbsp; This act of leading people’s options may have worked well in the past, but will people continue to tune to such news shows when time after time the stories are so one-sided? I think not.

      Mudding and chatting via an instant messenger (IM) client are similar.&nbsp; The differences mostly are in that mudding communities are small, tech savvy communities where the instant messengers attract thousands of people on an hourly basis.  Within the IM realm, objects are rare and far less colorful then in most muds.&nbsp; A chat room may be named “the pub” or “the hot tub” but rarely do the participants role play except to briefly interact with others currently online.  Identity is far more suspect in IM.&nbsp; Meeting the same person twice is rare unless that person is added to your “friends” list.&nbsp; Masquerading as another gender, age or individual is commonplace though looked down upon by those who use a single identity exclusively.  Robots commonly referred to as “bots” are also common in chartrooms.&nbsp; These bots much like the bots present in the muds, however the bots primary purpose within the chat room is to lure users to porn sites.&nbsp; Which lately have become more and more interactive luring many an unsuspecting user to sites that are not what they were originally looking for.  Although identity issues can be troubling, many different resources exist for the would be chatter.&nbsp; Users who are uncomfortable with identity being either too fixed or too fluid should choose a service that caters to their individual taste.

      Artificial life(Alife) is a super set of &nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI), where AI is focused directly upon making machines think, Alife is focused upon developing a simple set of rules that will allow hardware or software to adapt and adjust to environmental conditions, essentially being able to evolve.  Where AI focuses upon super complex programming and huge databases to program in intelligence, Alife leans upon a rule set that governs actions, this rule set ideally would include the ability to learn from the environment that it interacts with.  Artificial Intelligence has Alife, but Alife need not have AI.&nbsp; A machine extensively programmed to the point of having AI, would also have the basics that would constitute Alife.  The stark difference between Alife and AI is that Artificial Intelligence circles do not claim that a machine with AI is a living system.&nbsp; Alife circles however seem very preoccupied upon what exactly is the definition of life in order to attempt to create it within hardware or software, essentially attempting to create a living system.  Another difference is that AI attempts to mimic human intelligence, where Alife is initially far simpler and is focused upon developing a rule set that will allow a system to adapt and evolve through time and experience.

      Turning Test (p2): Being able to pass as human during a dialog (1959 A. Turning)  Alife (p3): adaptive, robust, flexible, (and friendly) “Life is a kind of behavior, not a kid of stuff” – Langon (96) Aims: (1) To create viable computer simulations of biological forms and processes as a method of studying “natural” life.&nbsp; (Weak) (2) To synthesis new forms of artificial life in both hardware (robotics) and software.&nbsp; (Strong)  Emergent Life (p3):  That which is not programmed in, evolves spontaneously, from bottom up through interaction with environment. First Order: Any behavior or property that cannot be found in a systems individual components or their additive properties. Second Order:&nbsp; Appearance of a behavior, which stimulates the development of adaptive behavior (involves the evolution of the ability to evolve.)  Anthropomorphism (p4): Attribution of human characteristics to inanimate objects, animals, or natural phenomena.  Epistemology (p4): The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge, its presuppositions and foundations, and its extent and validity.  Paradigm (p4): Model; A set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline.  Memetic (p4): Study of memes and their social and cultural effects. Memes: A unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another.  Epoch (p4): A point in time  Autonomy (p4): The condition or quality of being not controlled by others or by outside forces independent.  Derided (p5) To speak of or treat with contemptuous mirth.  Entropy (p5): A measure of the loss of information in a transmitted message.  Posthumanism: post liberal humanism (p6):  Is an attitude on how to deal with the limitations of the human form.&nbsp; It is a vision of how to move beyond those limits by the radical use of technological and other means. URL= http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/Posthuman.html  &nbsp; Autopoiesis (p6):  the process whereby an organization produces itself. An autopoietic organization is an  urlLink autonomous  and self-maintaining unity which contains component-producing processes. The components, through their interaction, generate recursively the same network of processes which produced them. An autopoietic system is operationally closed and structurally state determined with no apparent inputs and outputs. A cell, an organism, and perhaps a corporation are examples of autopoietic systems. See  urlLink allopoiesis.  (F. Varela)  Literally, self-production. The property of  urlLink systems  whose components (1) participate recursively in the same  urlLink network  of productions that produced them, and (2) realize the  urlLink network  of productions as a  urlLink unity  in the space in which the components exist (after Varela) (see  urlLink recursion ). Autopoiesis is a process whereby a system produces its own  urlLink organization  and maintains and constitutes itself in a space. E.g., a biological cell, a living organism and to some extend a corporation and a society as a  urlLink whole.
