       It is Saturday morning and I am just hanging out at Kent's place.  I stayed the night and today he is working so I have just been sitting around here.  Ok, that's a lie, I was actually sleeping until 4:00 so that is why it still feels like the morning to me.  Penny, left somewhere this morning and both Kent and Brandon had to work today.  Kent is still at the sweatshop and Brandon and I are in the computer room watching bike videos, etc. We Kent should be home any minute now so I will wrap this up.  Have a good Saturday night to the so many many people who read my blog!  Be responsible and stay clean... (roll eyes)

       I am in Kent's computer room.  Took about an hour to get everything that we needed for our LAN party.  It should have only took about 30-45 minutes.  But I made 2 trips home to get some things I forgot.  We are all set up but Kent's computer is having issues... :(  I sent him America's Army and it transfered at 300 kb/s.  But the Dell won't install anything... :(  I think he has some major issues.  So instead of our LAN, I am playing alone while he... tries to download the file from another server.  Finally, he just found a good server.  Should be done in and hour.  I still don't believe it will solve what I want... :(  Let's hope.  This would have been so awesome... :(  Oh well, HAVE FAITH!  Now, Kent is watching Red vs Blue that I sent him and I am still, playin' alone.  HURRAY!  The download is complete!  Yeah, I have been writing this post on and off for a few hours... f*ck this post.  I am pissed off at a few people... CAPICHE!   urlLink    LAN Party Panorama

       I did my regular ruitine today.  Went to physio and did my 10 minutes on elliptical and 10 minutes on the stair climber.  Not sure if I have mentioned this in previous posts or not, but it is very tiring and hard for me.  I have been doing stair climber for... 4 weeks now and this is about my second week doing both stair climber and elliptical.  When I first began doing both, I was dead tired and my legs were burning and sore.  Now, I work up a good sweat and it feels 'good'.    I was progressed today to jumping.  No, I am not allowed to do my dunks anymore, just jump rope height of jump.  I am supposed to try this one day, take a day off try it again.  If the knee joint tollerates that, I am allowed to run 1 minute, walk 1 minute.  Again, taking a day off inbetween.  But this is added a minute at a time.  Once I get up to 10 minutes or jog and 10 minutes of walk.  I am allowed to run freely for how long I wish.  After this, I can being lunges onto the operated knee. (cringe)  I am also allowed to mow lawns, so I can make more money with my little business. :D  I think we are getting a new lawn mower tomorrow so it will be easier to 'push' (self-propelled).  That is the current update on my knee.  I think it's time for me to shower... I smell after that physio and work-out on the Bowflex... M M M M M... rippedness... :)   urlLink    ACL Poster 1 of 3   urlLink    ACL Poster 2 of 3   urlLink    ACL Poster 3 of 3

       I borrowed a pedometer from my wellness teacher the other day.  I was curious to know how far I was walking in a day, how far I went during my physio training, etc.  Just pure curioustity.  In under 2 days, I have made 15 656 steps! :|  This totals to 14.40 km.  Now, if you are saying, that's nothing!  I f*cking hate you!  I have not been physically active what so ever for about a year.  Then, once my knee surgery was completed, I spend 2 weeks at home, sitting on my ass doing absolutely nothing!  Muscle atrophy my friends... my left leg (operated knee) looked... still does... like a 5 year-old's leg.  The right calf looked massive compared to my left.  I mean, I know my legs are not big by anymeans, but still.  Amazing how you can lose muscle mass so immidiately.  Something that I have learned and taken from the knee surgery, other than the information I had studied, is that do not take things for granted.  I have noticed to not take my legs for granted.  Broken Foot = 2 Weeks On Crutches = Hell... ACL Reconstructive Surgery = 2 Weeks At Home = 5 Weeks On Crutches... F*ck was it ever nice to walk again I tell yeah...

       If you do not play MSN, then you most likely do not understand the title.  :@  Is a 'command' on MSN to show an emoticon.  This emoticon shows anger with a scowling red face.  I am kinda pissed off right now (Hence the title...).  Not entirely sure what it is, but it seems numerous events have just thrown me over the edge.  I was filling out my grad party form and wrote down 8 tickets (8 beer/coolers/rum/etc.) and my Mom says that's too much.  I was offended by her telling me what I can and can't do, so I slammed the pen down and came into here.  Turned up my angry music, A Static Lullaby, The Distillers, just anything loud, hard, with alot of bass.  It sure shows my emotion.  So yeah... parents... seem so damn aggravating at times... Well that is all for now... Can't wait for supper... 8-) (Rolling eyes emoticon...)

       Hiya.  So yeah, title says it all.  It's late, and I feel I should post anyways.  School was... school.  Nothing great.  I didn't have homework so that's a plus.    After school I did my routine physio treatment.  This consists of 10 minutes on and eliptocal and 10 minutes on a stair climber.  Sure, sounds easy to you people, but don't be physically active for a year and spend two weeks of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and get some of that good ol' muscle atrophy.  So, for me, it is pretty tough.  It is getting easier so that is a plus.  I was then awaited by Laura and Kendra sitting in my van.  I usually go straight home and do a work-out.  But instead, we sat around and talked for a good length of time then they wanted to play with Bowflex, so we did.    This afternoon I had received my windscreen for my bike.  So after dinner, I installed that for about 10 minutes.  Scott came and gave a hand.     urlLink    F.Fabbri Darksmoke Windscreen 1   urlLink    F.Fabbri Darksmoke Windscreen 2   urlLink    F.Fabbri Darksmoke Windscreen 3  We then went to his house and played some X-box Live for an hour or so.  THEN, we took the Yuskalade (Yukon/Escalade) for a drive.  She's perdy I tell yeah... I mean, who in Shaunavon has '20's on their feets'? Please!  We went to his shop to look at his bike parts.  They are primed and need one more sanding session and are ready for powdercoating.  I can't wait for his bike to be ready!  It is said to be ready by the middle to the end of June.  Which works out great for me because it is when about I will start riding.  So this way I am not tempted to force my knee.  We also looked at the Yamaha R6 at his shop.  Spiffy!  But no SV... :D  He then dropped me off at home.   The day was good... It is pretty late and I still have to e-mail Laura so I will leave today's post with this in your head... How can I get better sleeping patterns?  Post them in comments! Thanks,

       Hm... I was first introduced to blog's was when I read Kosta and Gerard's.  When I was reading them I was like, 'This is dry.  I want a blog and I will entertain the WORLD!'  Well, now that I have a blog, I have abso-fucking-lutely nothing to say.  :(    As you know, if you read my first post, doubtful... but as you know, I was up late last night.  Oh say... 3-ish.  I had to wake up and go to the sweatshop (work) this morning.  All week I had been dreading going to work.  Not to sure why, I just wanted a long weekend where I had nothing to think about or worry about, I suppose.  But, once I got there, alittle tired, I realized that my job is quite good.  I am fortunate to have the job I do.  For you people who are dumb and shouldn't have been reading this because you don't know me, I work at a computer store, Legacy Computers/Radio Shack.  The ... (10 minutes later...) Yeah, OK I am easily distracted, MSN (the best procrastination tool of all), eBay, SV650.org, Winamp, just to name a few, distracted me for a couple minutes.  Anyways... The... morning was fairly quiet.  This meant I got to fix computers.  Little spyware issues.  I hate you spyware... (glare)  But then again, if it wasn't for spyware my job wouldn't exist.  So, I would like to thank spyware for providing me with a job.  Secondly, I would like to thank Spybot: S&D and HijackThis! for making my job that much easier.  I would I went for my 30 minute lunch break and arrived to a busy store.  Some lady, not to mention anynames... phoned in the afternoon.  Wanted someone to come over and fix her computer right away!  I said Rob was busy at the moment and I will leave a message for him to get back to her.  (Rob is my boss, more like... yeah boss, but real nice boss.)  So anyways... (15 minutes later, distracted by HijackThis!)... Hmm now I am all ugly registry free I guess... :S  SO ANYWAYS, at work, I gave Rob the message.  At this point the store was busy.  He told me to call her back and say today is not an option to come over but he will for sure go there Tuesday.  He also said, if she sounded angry to offer and say he'd be willing to meet her there on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.  I called her back and she was the biggest bitch to me.  "I've bought this this and this from there I think I deserve the service."  I try to tell her that she can meet with him Sunday or Monday and she persists on cutting me off!  Saying "I bought all this." and "I will get my husband to talk to him then."  I finally got it through and she threatens me with, "I will get my husband to call him."  I kinda wanted to punch her in the face.  'Cause Rob does not sell shy of service, he knows all his customers on a personal note and is very accomodating. (7 hours later, I went out...)  So as it turned out, Rob had to go over their, being the good man he is, and fixed it for her.  I held 'fort' all by myself.  I sold some items, helped people out, felt good.  Nerve racking, but good.  The rest of the day went well, fixed some more computers, had the odd customer come in, talked with Rob.  It was well.    After work I came home and had tacos for dinner.  Then after that Laura, popped over for abit. Then Chris, Kent, and Jeremy, THEN we went to the Big House to see Sarah and after that... drove around, got pulled over.  Talked to some drunk/stoned people in my school... then... went to Kent's, hung out there.  Not alot, not uneventful night, better than most.  Well, yet again, I have managed to stay up till 3:30 to post.  I think I will wrap this up and see what I have tp write for my next post... Hm... I better start thinking... :D

       YAHOO!  It is riding season!  Firstly, reason I have not been posting lately... I am gonna create the excuse of I was studying.  I wrote two grade 12 finals last week.  English30A, which I wrote on Monday was lengthy.  Only about 5 pages long in questions but I wrote 6 pages of fullscap.  This consided of... 2 essays I think.  Perhaps 3, it was a week ago.  My other exam was Math30B.  This was a departmental, meaning I had to write a test made by the Saskatchewan government.  This was a 50 question multiple choice. Thankfully, it was multiple choice because there was a few questions I had no idea on how to complete.  These questions, I eneded up guessing on.  Both these exams took nearly the full time to write.  Just under 2 hours and 30 minutes for each.    Then, once I was done Wednesday at noon, I was officially ready to ride the SV!!  Well, I shouldn't be riding her yet...  Doctor said I can't ride until full recovery.  But I am thinking what is a couple of months?  I can't possibly miss my summer and not ride.  It's been hard enough so far.  So I made it once I was done riding exams, I would start riding again.  If I was to ride before exams, I knew I would not study a minute.    I have been riding nearly everyday and love it!  The first ride, I was worried I'd forget how to ride... not the case.  Sat on the pony and it all came back to me!  Just like that!  I guess it's like riding a bicycle, you never forget how to ride.  The SV looks so god damn gorgeous!  I will post some pictures on the new modifications and other happenings with my baby...

       Kaiser Cave came into my life in 1991.  He was not only a pet, but a friend and a brother.  I do not remember his puppy years.  I was only 5 years old so it went by so quickly.  It is so sad that I cannot remember him two years ago.  That is a regreat that I have.  He was a great dog to me.  He'd lick my back for some odd reason.  He'd also walk around the house licking the floor too.  He spent much of his life sleeping in the sun spots, by the heater, and close to his friends.  When we got Gabby, he looked out for her.  He did seem jealous but wouldn't show it.  She was his eyes and ears.  When someone came to the house, Gabby'd get up and kaiser would immidiately start barking.  Gabby gave Kaiser some flack, always wanting to play and jumping on him.  Once Gabby was put down, rest her soul, Kaiser noticed that she was gone.  It was almost as if he was looking for her constantly.  He missed her, you could tell.  Kaiser would come into the computer room and roll around even until his last few days.  On June 18th, 2004, we had to put Kaiser down.  Kaiser was 14 years of age and had lived a long life for a wirehaired dachshund.  I will miss Kaiser.  Miss all the memories of him.  Closing the door when I leave for school having him watch me walk all the way out and down the front steps.  Kaiser will be gratly missed.  And this house will seem very empty with no dogs within.  Sorry for this rambling non-sense.  I had to do it for Kaiser and myself.  I love you Kaiser!  See yeah later Kais'.  :( :'(

       	Everyone has had a minor knee problem at one time or another. Whether it was caused from everyday wear and tear, overuse, or sports injury.  The knee joint, is separated by menisci (two discs that act as 'cushions'). Ligaments and muscles connect the femur (upper leg bone) and fibula and tibia (lower leg bones).  The quadricep tendon connects to the patella (kneecap) and to the quadriceps (upper leg muscles).  The patellar tendon connects the patella to the tibia.  Articular cartilage covers the ends of the bones.  In my opinion, the knee is a poorly designed joint for the stress it succumbs to. Although,  I am biased as you will understand after reading this essay. 	   	I began playing soccer for the Swift Current United provincial team in the year 2000.   We went to North Battleford for provincials that year.  In the final game, I scored to make the score 1 – 0.  We went on to be provincial champions in 2000.  I continued to play with Swift Current United in 2001 and 2002.  On July 6th, 2002, I was playing in the provincial southern playdowns in Regina.  Early into the first game was when my injury occurred.  The ball was in the open and I leaped  leading with my left leg in the air.  From my left, the larger opponent's knee hit the inside of my left knee.  As my left knee planted on the ground, his momentum kept moving through my knee. Consequently, his momentum dislocated it and tore my anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and some lateral meniscus.  Since that date, it has been an ongoing injury.  I have never played soccer since that day. I have experienced problems with other sports as well.  Football was too vigorous with the tackling and planting.  Hockey, on the other hand, was do-able. In hockey, I was able  to favor my left leg, putting more stress on the other.  I am conscience of when I am going to be hit into the boards to brace myself with my right leg, protecting the left.   	 	I had a knee brace that enabled me to be active.  The brace was  to "help prevent" further injury of the knee.  That's exactly what the brace did, it assisted in stability. Although, it was not very effective.  This custom fit brace featured ultra-light carbon composite frame and weighed under 25 oz.   It was also equipped with dual hinges and a full extension lock.  Also, the custom paint job I picked, flames, is pretty awesome.  For $1900.00, my knee still wanted to dislocate nearly every hockey game.  Other than the pain which I became immune to, this Innovation Sports CTi2 knee brace allowed me to play a sport I love.   urlLink    CTi² Knee Brace 1   urlLink    CTi² Knee Brace 2 	 	Two years after the initial injury, my growth plates were finally closed.  Meaning, I was done growing and ready for surgery on January 8th, 2004. 	 	ACL reconstructive surgery is a somewhat complicated procedure.  The purpose of the surgery is to restore normal stability and function of the knee, limit the loss of function in the knee, and prevent injury to the other knee.  In my case, the ACL was completely tore so it needed to be replaced.  To do so, a graft, made from strong material, would be found elsewhere on my body.  The common grafts used are the patellar tendon or hamstring muscle.  My doctor, Dr. Michael Paul Bering, decided to use open surgery with a graft from my patellar tendon.  The surgery was originally booked for two and a half hours at Medicine Hat Regional Hospital.  On March 1st, 2004, at about 10:00 am, I was moved out of my room and into the operating room.  I met with my doctor to go over everything and took a relaxant.  Immediately after arriving in the operating room, I was transferred onto a narrow operating bed where I was met by my anesthesiologist.  My arms were extended out from my sides, and a needle was injected into my left arm.  The last thing I remember, is telling the anesthesiologist, "I don't think it's working."   For this procedure, I was under general anesthesia.  The doctor then makes the incision down the front of the knee, approximately two inches.  There was four other small incisions around the knee.  One was used to pump sterile saline solution to expand the knee and wash blood from the area.  This hole was also used to insert a tube which led to a pump that aided in the drainage of the blood after the surgery.  The other three holes were for the arthoscopic equipment.  A tool with a camera on the end takes digital images and are displayed on a monitor in the operating room.  Surgical drills were placed through the small incisions.  The doctor drills holes in the upper and lower leg bones forming a tunnel.  This "passage" will be used for the new tendon graft.  At this stage, the doctor takes a graft from the middle of the patellar tendon.  The doctor, also removes small pieces of bone from either end called "bone blocks".  This new graft is pulled through the "tunnels" in the upper and lower leg bones.  The bone grafts are now secured into place by a screw at either end.  The doctor then closes the incision with staples.  In my case, the incision down the front was about two and a half inches long and used fourteen staples to keep it shut.  Four other staples were used in the small holes on the sides of the knee.  This procedure ran long and took three hours to complete.  From this stage, I was taken into the recovery room were I woke up for about an hour.  The next day, I was given a quick briefing on crutches and how to get around at home. This information was communicated to me by the occupational and physiotherapists.  I was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday March 2nd around 2:00 p.m.   urlLink    Preparing For Surgery.

Helped Keep Swelling Down, Greatly!   urlLink    Drain 2  	One of the most important things about ACL reconstructive surgery, is the rehabilitation and therapy.  Since the recovery time is so lengthy, you lose a lot of muscle mass in your leg.  On my discharge, my therapy began.  I had met with occupational and physiotherapists in the hospital.  My instructions were pressure, ice, elevation, and rest. (P.I.E.R.).  The goal in the first one to two weeks is mainly to minimize the swelling.  These four steps would be my "work out" for the two weeks I spent laying around the house. I wore a tensor everyday until the majority of the swelling was lost.  Icing the knee for fifteen minutes every two to four hours was also important to minimize the swelling.  Elevation and resting the knee was the most important in my opinion.  I spent two weeks sitting around the house elevating my knee above my heart for the majority of my days.  My first physiotherapy appointment was four days post-operation.  My physiotherapist, Diane Greenlay, was not able to further me on exercises according to the ACL protocol given to her from my doctor.  I was to work on getting full extension by laying my leg flat and applying pressure to the top.  An exercise to eliminate swelling, given by my physiotherapist, was to pump my ankles.   Stage one of the protocol, zero to ten days after the surgery, had goals to heal the scar, crutch walking, attain 0° to 90° range of motion, and begin to regain quadricep control.  I was instructed to continue to use P.I.E.R.  I was to concentrate on gaining my full range of motion, especially my extension so that my ligaments do not shorten.  A range of motion exercise was to sit on the end of a bed and softly swing my legs back and forth.  My range of motion was being restricted due to the swelling around the knee joint.  At about seven to ten days I was supposed to begin patellar and scar mobilization.  This "knee cap wiggling" was to pump out swelling, loosen up the patellar tendon, and prevent the skin where the scar was located from attaching, losing it's pliability.  I was permitted to crutch walk as tolerated to aid in gaining my extension in the joint and to help correct my posture.  Ten days to six weeks was stage two of the protocol.  The goals were to attain regular extension, 0° to 190°, increase general leg strength in quadriceps and hamstrings, ensure patella and scar mobility, and discontinue crutches at three to six weeks.  Two weeks after the surgery, I went to see my doctor.  I was sent to radiology where two x-rays were taken, medial and a skyline images.  I went to castings where the sixteen staples were removed from my knee.  Dr. Bering then looked at my x-rays and then my knee.  I asked him a few questions.  Diane Greenlay had found a lump located on my hamstring, which I asked Dr. Bering about.  He was not sure what this mass was, so he is booking me an appointment to get a magnetic resolution image (MRI) of it.  The exercises for stage two remained the same until six weeks post-op.  At this point, I was advanced to begin a light cardiovascular on an elliptical, stair climber, or stationary bicycle with low resistance.  Stage three occurs at six to twelve weeks after the surgery date.  This stages' goals are to continue increasing strength and endurance.  I am just beginning to enter this stage.  Exercises that increase your leg strength would be calf raises and leg squats.  Both of those can be reduced to single leg.  Endurance continues to use the  elliptical, stair climber, stationary bicycle, and swimming exercises.  Stage four is the longest recovery stage, twelve to twenty-four weeks.  Again, like the previous stages, increasing endurance and strength, but back to it's original state.  Endurance can be increased by light jogging in a straight line on a flat surface and cord running (forwards and backwards).  I am going to begin with jog then walk with one minute intervals.  Low impact aerobics are permitted.  Stage five is the final stage at twenty-four weeks on.  This stage allows the patient to continue with sports if the doctor permits.  The way my recovery has been proceeding, physiotherapist Greenlay said I will be able to play football in the fall with no problems.   	  urlLink    X-Ray   urlLink    The Final Product  	Tearing my ACL has been a life experience.  This surgery, if continues to be successful, will allow my life to continue on.  I will be very pleased and would recommend the surgery if I am able to play sports again.  Hopefully, in the future, I will look back on these days just as a memory of a 'bump in the road of life'.

       Last night at 7:00 was Colour Night.  For some of you who do not know what Colour Night is, it's a evening where academic, athletic, and other awards are given to students of the Shaunavon High School.  As far as friends go:   Chris : Top Male Jr. Track Athlete as he competed in 100m at the provincial track meet on June 4th, in Saskatoon.    Kent : Computer Honourable Mention for grade 10.  (Congratulations, young apprentice!  May the force be with you!)     Gayle, Me, Laura, & Sarah : Honour Role  (80% average or better)  and Major Athletic Awards.  Laura : Social Studies Honourable Mention, English Honourable Mention, Science Honourable Mention, Math Honourable Mention, French Honourable Mention, Physical Education Honourable Mention, Work Ethic Honourable Mention, Art Honourable Mention, the Proficiency Award, and 2nd Highest Average in grade 9.     (Takes a deep breath)  Congratulations to all my friends.  I am glad that I am friends with a group that can apply themselves and be successful in many diverse ways.  You make me proud.    As for myself... I don't like to boast and I try to avoid it, but I will share mine with you, cause I mean, this is a Blog about ME! ;) I received the History Award, Computer Science Award, and Good Work Ethic Award.  I am glad I won the History Award because, not only was my mark good, but I actually enjoy the topic.  I find myself a history 'buff'.  I am interested in World War I, but even more so, World War II.  Mr. Smith knew that I watched and owned many WWII movies.  He was also surprised to know that sometimes I'd go onto a site, that he had recommended for me for any historical essays, and just read up on things for my own personal interest and good.  The Computer Science Award, was also appreciated.  I had the knowledge going into the class and the highest average throughout the semester.  Everyone says I won because I work at Legacy Computers.  It is true that I've learned alot at Legacy, but what I have learned there from Rob and Evan was not taken in the class.  I knew alot of the topic before I worked there.  The Work Ethic was also earned in my biast opinion.  I calculated that I had missed 5½ weeks of school.  I got very sick in the first semester with mononucleosis and viral meningitis.  I was in the hospital for one week  (Missed my f*cking Birthday!)  and missed 2½ weeks sitting at home.  The other 2 weeks I missed were for the recovery of my knee surgery that I spent at home hopping around on one leg between the toilet, fridge, TV, and computer.  I also missed days here and there for doctor appointments, holidays, track meet, etc.  So to keep a 90% average after all of that is a accomplishment in itself.  I believe my cocky rant is done.    The night was good and I feel it's nice to see people awarded for the effort they put in year round.  Makes one feel good inside.   Now, if I missed your name and the awards that you have won in the first paragraph, let me know and I will edit the post.   (If I consider you a friend of course...)

       On June 7th,  (I know, this post is alittle late.  I have been busy with school as there is only 6 days left of regular classes.  Then I write and english final on Monday and a math final on Tuesday.)    MRI is the use of a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to produce electronic images of specific atoms and molecular structures in solids, especially human cells, tissues, and organs.  Now, basically, it is like a CT scan where you slide into the massive tube and lay there while they... scan you.  So, I did some research on the topic as I like to know what I am getting myself into so that I can empower myself.  I learned about it from  urlLink WebMD .  One thing I had heard of  (from Morgan)  was that you need an injection.  Now, I am not afraid of needles, but I have had my fair share lately.  Giving blood, hooked up to IV's for surgery and my mono/meningitis near death experience, and many for my spinal tap... :|  (Note to self: Do not get spinal tap)   So, I have come to the conclusion that I hate the "hype" about needles, dentists, surgeries, etc.  I sit and think too much and scare myself crazy.   urlLink WebMD , told me that sometimes 'Contrast material  (Is a substance used to make specific organs, blood vessels, or types of tissue, such as tumors, more visible on X-rays. Contrast material may also be used during a CT scan, an ultrasound, or an MRI scan) may be injected into your knee joint. To reduce discomfort, the technologist may inject local anesthetic into your joint before the contrast material. Then additional MRI scans are done.'  Needle in my knee... NO THANK YOU!    Reason this MRI is taking place is during my recovery, at physio, a lump of 'mass' was noticed on the back of my knee up around the hamstring.  I showed Dr. Bering (my knee specialist) and he was not sure of this so wanted it to get checked out.  My doctor got me in early in Medicine Hat as there is a long waiting list in Saskatoon.  I told Diane Greenlay, my physio therapist, this and she said I was lucky.  "Consider yourself lucky, only cancer patients get this special treatment."  :/ Ah... excuse me?  I have cancer on my leg, fantastic!  I do not think that is what have gathered there, more that my doctor has an interest in me and is curious to what it is.  I had the MRI appointment booked at 2:15 PM in Medicine Hat and was to arrive at 1:30 PM.  I walk into the visual diagnostics waiting room after being sent all over the hospital from waiting room to waiting room.  A nurse led me into another room and asked me some questions.  It was from a form which I had filled about when I had my staples removed.  The questions consisted of, if I had metal in my eye, or any new surgeries, etc.  She also asked what kinda of music I liked.  I just said something current.  I didn't want to be picky and say, "Punk!".  Then a bald guy, maybe early 20's comes over.   "Doctor Pain is in the house," he says.   I am like... "Uh oh,"  :|    "Just kidding," he says.  He sits down, "Wait, the lady earlier told you you'd be getting a needle right?"   "Yes," I reply with. "OK good.  I hate it when I come over, 'Oh by the way, here comes a needle!'." the brute man stated.  "Do you have those big gushy veins?" "Ah... I am not too sure," I replied. He straps the rubber band thing around my upper arm and says, "OH YEAH!  That's what I like."  How can one get excited over such a thing?  Must be a medical thing... :S  "Don't worry, it's not a big needle, it won't hurt.  I will put an IV in, but it's not like the rigid needle it will be a soft tube.  Like this,"  flicks some tape that will be used to told the IV in place.  "OK good.  But I wouldn't know what is considered a 'big' needle, I don't look." "OK, just look away then.  Here's alittle poke."  Jabs the needle through my epidermis blood squirts into my eye!  OK, over dramatic.  Didn't feel a thing.  Then he left a needle thing attached to my arm which contained the contrast material.  "This part is cool.  You gotta watch this.  Now... are you a bleeder?"  He pulls the needle thing out and some of my blood is dilluted into the needle's canister.   (Don't exactly know the terminology)     I removed my metal items, watch, chain, belt and buckle.  I also left my debit card and license as the machine can 'zap' them.  Also left bunnyhug, hat, and other pocket items.  I walk towards the room the man says, "After your done you get this!" He holds up a huge, thick needle, with the liquid running down the tip.  I look towards the nurse knowing he's joking as she shakes her head and leads my into the room with the MRI machine.  (See MRI picture below)   I was layed down on the table.  My knee was strapped down and in a plastic tube thing.   (Also in MRI picture below)   I was then slide into the machine upto about my shoulders.  I could still see the ceiling.  I was given headphones and the lady nurse left me with the panic button and said the scans would begin in a few minutes.  I sit there and wait for my music.  Lady comes on, "Oh, I picked out Now 6 for you."  I laugh to myself and think sarcastically, 'Nice choice...'.    I sat for a few more minutes when the man came on and said, "Ah... I am gonna get you a better CD... something you will actually like."  I laugh and give a thumbs-up to the window behind me that they watch me through.  The scans began.  The MRI machine is very loud and 'clunky'.  I could hear it over my music.  They did about 10 minutes of scans  (Seemed like 10 minutes, I had no track of time.)   Then they told me they'd come in and give me my injection.  The nurse and the man walk in and play around with my IV for abit while I listen to my music.  They are talking to me and I can't really hear them just kind of nodding and smiling.    "You might feel a cold feeling and a taste in your mouth," the man says, "Anything?"   I shake my head 'No'.  I did feel a very slight cold tingle up my arm for about 2 seconds but nothing serious. "OK, cool," he says.  They leave and continued the scans.  I was worried my knee would get sore because of the metal screws inside but there was nothing.  My feet and knee did get sore but I think it was because they never moved the whole time.  Also, I was looking for the pain too I think.  So the experience was fine.  I'd do it again.  I just hate the 'hype'.    I got out where my parents were waiting.  They said I was gone for an hour and ten minutes.  I was surprised it took so long.  I then went and got two x-rays of my knee, doctors orders.  This MRI was also a good way to see how the knee is recovering, the graft, ligaments, etc.    That is my adventure for the week.  I sure have experienced alot with this knee.  Seen things most people wouldn't.  I have more stories for the grandchildren as my mother says.  So, I thought I'd share this situation with everyone so that if they ever need one, not to worry like me.   urlLink    MRI

       The new America's Army: Special Forces Downrange was released Tuesday, June 1st, 2004.  This latest release in the America's Army game series continues to focus on the critical, specialized role of the Army's Special Forces within the U.S. Army as they fight the Global War on Terrorism, but expands the scope to include Stryker vehicles, and the M136 AT4.    New Weapon :  The M136 AT4 (the Army's primary light anti-tank weapon) is a recoilless rifle used primarily by  Infantry Forces for engagement and defeat of light armor.    Stryker Armored Vehicle : This version of America's Army introduces the Army's new Interim Armored Vehicle, a.k.a. the Stryker. The Stryker vehicle is currently implemented as a stationary vehicle with a fully functioning .50 cal turret usable by the player. The Stryker turret zoom in/out keys are defaulted to the MouseWheelUp and MouseWheelDown keys, however they can be changed through the settings menu.  New RPG and AT4 3D Ironsights with Adjustable Range Settings: Both the RPG-7 and the AT-4 have new adjustable 3D ironsights in this latest version of America's Army. These weapons both have the new functionality of 'adjustable range settings' based on the distance to target. The RPG/AT4 can be set to the following ranges: 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 meters.    New 'Tournament Mode' : This version of America's Army features new tournament mode features, which are accessible either via the command line or a GUI interface. These include an adjustable pre-match warm-up period with an in-game notification that the match is beginning. The time remaining until the  tournament start is also displayed on the score screen, as well as in-game reminders, and a final 10-second countdown.    New Demo/Kiosk Mode : New in this version of America's Army is a Demo/Kiosk mode. This 'Demo Mode' allows for the game to run demos either at the press of a button or after a customizable set time limit. This demo mode allows for the gameplay to be demonstrated without having internet connectivity. Player created demos can be used in this demo mode as  well.   Two New Maps : - SF Arctic - SF Village   Other Additions : - New Character 'Ragdoll' Physics - New U.S. Weapon - M136 AT4 - Realistic Suns Including Lens Flare - Bullet/Explosion decals on terrain - Display as OpFor option for Spinny Weapon Weapon Mod page  - Added locational damage for projectiles. Players no longer take global damage from getting hit with projectiles. They now take damage based on the speed of the projectile and the area of the body hit. For instance a player hit in the head with an RPG round will now die, but a hit to the arm would not be fatal.  - Added delayed shell ejection. Weapons with delayed shell ejection (M203, M24, Mos, BS1 etc.) will now eject spent shells. Bolt action weapons now correctly eject shells when working the bolt.  - Player Count is displayed next to each team (Assault and Defense)  - Player Start: Indigenous Force Advanced Marksman (VSS Vintorez Sniper)  - New Arctic Indigenous Force player textures.  - Added turret death message - SF Sandstorm: added new animated palm trees and louder ambient wind sounds - Adjusted the AK74 iron sight position to provide a better sight picture and reduce model "jitter" - Binoculars no longer breathe cycle - Improved team swapping. Will now fulfill players change team requests better   Screenshots :   urlLink    Village 1:  Detailed Background   urlLink    Village 2: Detailed Background, Sky, Sun, and Fire/Smoke Effects   urlLink    Sun Lens Flare 1   urlLink    Sun Lens Flare 2 (Scope)   urlLink    Invisible Spectating Effect   urlLink    'Ragdoll' Dieing Physics   urlLink    New RPG and AT4

       Yeah... title was influenced by Chris. I was originally going to say that I feel like a good guy. The other night when Chris and I were leaving the resort lobby, I spotted a turtle in the parking lot up against the curb. So, I immidiately thought to myself that there was a good chance of it either getting run over, lost, or dried out. So, I decided to save it. We walked to the water trap  (In pitch black)  and Chris located the water. I then set him in the water and then set him free. It felt great, especially cause I am an owner of a red-eared turtle, myself.

       In my previous post I claimed that I went 180 km's on my bike... Well, I must confess that that was a slight bending of the truth.  I only saw 177 km's on the speedometer so technically, I cannot claim to have gone that fast.   But, today, that does not matter. ..    I was awaken today by my sister who gave me the phone.  It was Kim from work, she told me to bring left-handed scissors tomorrow because I have to cut out crap for 'I Love Shaunavon'.  :(  Anyways, I fell asleep and was woken by Tyler.  'Wake up, we're going to Eastend.'  So, I got up, put on clothes and we rode to Eastend.  He bought me my chicken burger with bacon and iced tea.   On the way there, I am proud to say, I went 200 km's.  And this is not a lie, I swear!  I wanted to see the 2 - 0 - 0.  Also, unlike the 180 km's, this was for about half a minute.  I did not reach my speed goal then let off, I rode for a bit which was intense!  It took a bit of time to reach that speed aswell.  We ate, and rode back.  I tried getting to 200 again, but only made 195, riding next to Tyler.  He signalled to stop as my license plate holder was falling off.  So for 10 minutes, I ride with my left hand on the tail of the bike holding this home-made jobbie together.  We stopped in Dollard at an abandoned house and found a bolt to temporarily fix it.     That is my journey for today... Such a fast one at that... :D

       Boo yeah!  I went for my motorcycle exam this morning at 10:00.  I was SO nervous!  I tried to convince myself that it was not a big deal and I could just go for it again in two weeks.  Even so, I woke up every 5-10 minutes this morning starting at around 7:00.  ALso, I think didn't want to sleep through the appointment.  When I arrived at the Shawnee Hall, I met my instructor as she was just walking back after testing Jared Smith (He got his license).  She led my outside where we went to the bike and checked signals, brake, horn, etc.  I was given a radio deal, thicker than a pack of cigarettes which clipped on my jacket.  She then followed me in a car given me command from a radio.  At first, I never thought this clip-on system would actually work, but it was fine.  I did some left and right turns through-out town.  Yields, stops, the whole bit.  She even took me onto the highway, and it wasn't an 80 km speed zone which I was only permitted to.  I went out to the vet clinic on this highway then did a two-point turn... yeah... weird.  :S  We went back to town turning a few more.  On my right turns, my blocking position was off.  She came right up behind me.  She told me after this was my warning to move more to the right so a car can't pass.  Thing is, you have to be in the middle, can't be to far right, or you can be passed on the left.  Can't be too far left or they can pass you on the right.  So, what was to be my last turn, she came to the right and drove by and said, 'Let's go back to the office.' in a somewhat bitter voice.  I parked and walked over to her vehicle with a feeling of failure.  She told me that my blocking positions needed work.  I immidiately thought, see you in 2 weeks!  As she stood by her car, clipboard on the hood, I could tell she was debating whether to give it to me.  She also said that I was a tad to close to the center line.  So if she marked both of those, I would be done she said.  But, I was only marked for my blocking position on the right turns.  I believe she left the center line because I never crossed it and I was consistent on my position, it was not like I couldn't control being that close.  I was that close all exam.  So, in the end, I got it!  I felt great and thankful.  Thanks to the instructor... I think she felt that she didn't want me coming back to do the exam in two weeks because of a simple blocking position.  She made sure I understood what I was doing, and I stated I was aware of my mistake.  I was basically understanding and resonable, and for that, I think I earned it.  She stated there was nothing to dock me on and I had great control of the bike.  She also commented on my baby... :D  So, I shook her hand, thanked her, and went to SGI to renue my license.  I walked to my bike, and Tyler was riding up the street.  I hooked up with him and we did some riding.  We rode a few miles north of town, I tried to keep up.  We got him some mroe gas, then we went out to the golf course to visit my sister and grab some lunch.  After that, back into town, and back north on 36 highway again.  I got my bike up to 180 km!  I was so pumped!  Before, I was slowly getting there chasing Tyler down the highway, 140, 160, each run getting more comfortable.  I am proud of myself.  COnsidering, last year, I only had to bike up to about 130.  This year, I had only had it up to 100 until last night.  Great progress these past few days.  Having someone to ride with makes riding A MILLION times funner.  I am becoming a better rider because of it.  After all this riding, I went home rested a bit before I went to work at 1:30.    Tonight, I will be hanging out with Laura after I cut a lawn.  It was a productive, good, and happy day for me! :D

       Wow, tonight was intense!  Chris and I hung out.  We walked to the public school and watched the lightning.  It was so cool.  Forks,  heat, sheet, bolt, St. Elmo's fire, EVERYTHING!   So we tried finding Scott cause we saw him driving earlier and thought it'd be fun to go watch it on the corner of the town.  We ran around trying to catch him.  He did a U-turn about 20 feet away from us and drove off.  It was frustrating.  We eventually met up with him, as he was driving with Pete.  He picked us up in the Celica and we drove in that for abit.  We then went to Scott's truck and drove around.  The storm was immaculate!  Lightning every 5 seconds, serious.  It was raining crazy too.  The power had gone out and the streets were pitch black.  It was a fun night for once...

       On my last day of school, I came home and was sitting on the couch talking with my Mom and Dad.  I was discussing how my last exam, Math30B departmental, for the year went.  As we are talking, my Dad stands up and kinda gave my Mom a look.  He walks outside comes back in with Icon Super-Duty boots.  I was so surprised and grateful.  I was talking to them earlier about how I thought I should invest in some boots as every rider recommends them.  Well, I guess they do listen to me.  They said the reason the bought them was for the point previous and that I had a rough school year.  They said they were proud of me for the amount of school that I missed.  They said I missed alot, but never skipped a beat.  Thanks Mom and Dad!   	  The words "comfort" and "street boots" were never before closely associated. The all new Super-Duty boot is the first riding boot you will not be dying to get off your feet at the end of the ride. Super-Duty boots offer the protection you want in a serious riding boot and the styling of your favorite casual shoes. 	         · Hardened ankle, toe, and heel cups. 	· Molded plastic shift level nubs protects boot and offers incredible response. 	· Mid-foot stabilizer strap with Aluminum positive lock buckle. 	· Protected Nylon speed lacing system. 	· Padded Leather upper for comfortable "over-the-ankle" support. 	· Stitched on rubber outsole for traction and comfort.   urlLink ICON: Ride Among Us     urlLink    Icon Super-Duty

       That's right.  Today, before the f*cking rain, I have successfully travelled 1000 km's on the SV.  I feels great and I know there will be many more ahead of me.  The best companionship, me and the SV... :D   urlLink    Tachometer 1   urlLink    Tachometer 2

       I have Evan in on the mystery now as well.  Which helps cause he's hacked javascript before... legally of course.  Hopefully something will be pieced together.

            The first reports of the game began around July 16, 2004, when some prominent members of the ARG community  received jars of honey in the mail , in which the letters spelling out "ilovebees" were immersed.  At around the same time, an advert for  Halo 2  shown at screenings of I, Robot at Loews Cineplex theatres flashed a link to www.ilovebees.com, which is ostensibly a site related to beekeeping.  The site, however, was covered in content that did not pertain to bees at all, but was instead some form of gobbledygook. This link quickly spread amongst Halo fansites and ARG sites.  Shortly after the site was "attacked", the webmaster created a  webblog  stating that something had gone wrong, and the site itself was attacked. Later entries state that her attempts to fix it were in vain.  -   Wikipedia

        Some conspiracy has came up over the past week or so.  It seems the  Halo 2 Theatrical Trailer  has an 'Easter egg' of sorts.  At the end, for two frames, the  www.xbox.com  URL under the Xbox logo changes to  www.ilovebees.com . Now if you go to that site, it appears to be hacked. Looking deeper, you will find odd detail. Among these are the META keywords and cryptic messages scattered throughout the domain. It has been noted that the countdown on the front page is to August 24th 2004. This date is 77 days before Halo 2's release (Bungie has an odd fascination with the number seven, I've read). Some odd phrases can be found in the hex for several of the site's images as well.

       Yup. As of yesterday we got our new puppy! He is only 8 weeks old.  Will  is a purebred weimaraner. To give you an image of his size and look, when he is full grown, he will be similar to a lab and a greyhound. Not as heavy as a lab, not as small and thin as a greyhound.  Grey-ish coat and blue eyes.  Once he is full grown,  Will  will compete in dog shows. He needs to get 10 points to become a Canadian Champion (something like that).  So far, he has been venturing around the house, sleeping, eating, playing in the backyard, nawing on the concrete rocks, you know, things that dogs like to do. As far as I know, his official registered name will be Good  Will  Hunting. Oh yeah, he has a micro-chip in his back... he's a techi too! :D   urlLink     Will  1  (With His Brothers & Sisters)    urlLink     Will  2  (Looking Proud)     urlLink     Will  3  (Roaming The Backyard)    urlLink     Will  4  (Sitting)    urlLink     Will  5  (Most Likely Eating Twigs)    urlLink     Will  6  (Yeah... I don't know, he looks like a dinosaur.)
