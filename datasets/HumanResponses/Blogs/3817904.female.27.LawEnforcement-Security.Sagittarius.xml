        friday was my mother's birthday. if she had lived to see it, she would have been 55.&nbsp; i feel so cheated sometimes when i hear my friends talk about their moms and what they plan to do with them, cause i can only say that when i go home i plan to clean aroung my mother's grave and sit and talk to her and sing to her. i miss her so much. she is and was my air, the wind beneath my wings. i am so glad that i will be off for the next 2 days.  &nbsp;     &nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   urlLink http://members-services.blackplanet.com/members/mypage/personalpage-preview.html

       okay, i am back. my pain is acute today. i feel all loss keenly today, my Mami and Ja.                             Mami   I miss you every second of every day. Sometimes I feel as if I will go mad if I can't hear your sweet, squeaky voice in my ear saying "Hello Darling!" I can only achieve solace in my dreams, we are no longer separated, but walking hand in hand in beautiful lands. I long to just lay my eyes on you just once more, hug your beautiful soul to my troubled and broken one just one last time.  I feel your loss keenly, but i am reminded every time I look in a mirror. For you see, my dearest sweet little Mami, I wear your angelic face, squint my eyes through glasses, have your squeaky voice, funny little laugh, and Praise God, I walk your crooked walk! All this I acknowledge with the greatest of pride, your baby daughter twin.                            I love you always,                         Punkin Pooh, or your Lickle Nana

       another boring day at work! so ready to go home. been talking to my sister on the phone about my oh so cute little nephew, kherynton. still watching SEX and THE CITY. I am going home to watch The Family Guy dvd collection. I love love love Stewie! My noisy neighbors moved out and now it's so quiet at my townhouse. why am i so thirsty? why did this lady come in the bathroom while i was in there and got in the stall right next to mine and tear it up? okay, that was one of those boo boos she should have went home to take. okay i was just trying to sham, i was just sitting there reading, but it was my 15 minutes to play like i was using it, and she totally ruined it for me. stanky bootie azz little girl!!

       This is my first posting. Hello to anyone who is nosy enough about me to read this, :). I am so sad today, I miss my mami. I am angry because it is the first of the month, and that means rent time. I hate giving people my money, especially for something that I don't own. Time to prepare to buy another house. I finally saw Return of the King, the third part of the LOTR trilogy. I feel some depression trying to creep in, so time for a shot of humor. Bout to watch HOw High. And All About the Benjamins. Why do people call you when u have already let them know u ain't feeling that anymore? And that you are trying to work on getting yourself together so you can have a relationship with somebody?
