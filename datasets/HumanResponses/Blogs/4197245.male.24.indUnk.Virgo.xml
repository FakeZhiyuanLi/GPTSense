						   I had the pleasure to watch  The Passion of the Christ  and  The Last Temptation of Christ  over the last two days. You can not find two movies so diametrically opposed in their views of Jesus. I would like to share my opinions on the two films and what I feel about the controversies that surrounded both films.   The Passion  was one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. Mel Gibson really showed what Christ went through for all of humanity. I feel that this film should be seen by every Christian because it really brings home suffering that Jesus suffered for us while at the same time showing quite accurately (at least biblically) the way Jesus was viewed at that time. I can see why some people in the Jewish community may feel that it's anti-Semitic as the spiritual leaders were shown to be wanting bloodshed over Jesus. The one interesting thing to me was the portrayal of Pontius Pilate. He seemed to be a man that saw Jesus as innocent and actually wanting to believe in Christ. I don't know if it was actually that way in reality. I know that he felt that Jesus was innocent but in  The Passion  it seems to be more than just sympathetic. I can't really put it into words tho. The one brilliant thing about the film tho was the fact that it was done in Aramiac. I think the film would've lost much of its power if it was done in English. The use of the original language immerses the viewer into the world of Jesus and enhances the atmosphere within the film.   Last Temptation  on the other hand is a far more troubling film. I can see the merits of the battle between humanity and God. After all Jesus is said to be fully divine as well as human. The whole idea of Jesus wanting something that we take for granted is provocative yet may have some merit. After all there is a groundswell of support for the Historical Jesus so who is to say that Jesus didn't live on earth past the resurrection. (I don't necessarily agree with that but I find it interesting nonetheless) There are some problems with the film tho and it's to be expected when you're dealing with a subject that is best left for the print medium. Jesus is presented as someone who DOESN'T want to be the Son of God and be the saviour of humankind. He's also portrayed as a vacillating, doubtful and even spacy figure. This goes so against the traditional view of Jesus that it was quite frankly abhorrent to me. I however kept an open mind and watched the entire film. Another problem is the whole idea that the betrayal of Jesus was something that he and Judas basically collaborated on. Jesus has to actually talk Judas into the betrayal and in fact says to Judas that his (Judas' job) is the easy thing to do whereas Jesus being crucified for our sins is the hard job. This is true but I can't see how something like this could've happened.  The last 20-15 minutes of the film are the most disturbing. Satan has tempted Jesus offering human life and offering up a vision of Christ raising a family with Mary Magdalene while at the same time rejecting the very divine nature that he is. There's a scene in which he sees Paul and basically throws away the very core of Christianity by saying he wasn't crucified and that the Christianity that Paul's preaching is a bold face lie. near the end of this vision of Jesus being granted humanity it is the Judas/Jesus dynamic that is turned upside down as an aged Judas calls Jesus a failure, a coward and someone who didn't live up to his purpose on earth. This makes Jesus realize the temptation that Satan (who is in the form of a sweet girl) has offered him as something deplorable and Jesus begs God to allow him to be crucified and that he realizes his divine nature excludes him from having the humanity that we so enjoy.  Aesthetically the film was well done in some areas however I got such a negative feeling over Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Jesus. It seemed to me that there was just something inherently wrong with his Jesus. It was in the looks and also in the voice. I can't really explain it but it just didn't feel right.  In the end the two films have interesting views and while the latter film is far more deserving of the criticism it received it's still one that I think a lot of people should see if they haven't done so.

						   This is a lot later than this afternoon LOL but at least I get this done tonight. In the first part of the Liberalism vs Conservatism piece I examined the differences in ideology and how the two ideologies would handle some current event topics. In this post I will examine why there's such animus between the right and left.  I think the genesis of hating the left and liberalism in general occurred when Franklin Delano Roosevelt became president in 1933. The United States was in the throes of the Great Depression. The minimalist policies of Herbert Hoover hindered any chance for the US to climb out of the Depression and it was incumbent upon FDR to solve the problems ailing the nation. FDR decided to make the government more involved in the economic welfare of the state. This was accomplished by creating public works programs. Roosevelt tackled the economic problems by loosening credit and insuring deposits in the nation's banks, putting the country off the gold standard, and establishing the Securities and Exchange commission to regulate Wall Street.  It wasn't the economic side of the New Deal that rankled most people to the point that being a democrat would be equated with being extremist. It was the social programs that did that. As mentioned earlier Roosevelt created Public Works programs but he also established Social Security along with using the nation's natural resources with the establishment of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Rural Electrification Administration.  It was just 30 years later that the imprint of modern liberalism was made with LBJ's Great Society program. It was an ambitious program that sought to heal the rift between blacks and the mainstream of America. The central thrust of the Great Society was social with the goal of eliminating poverty. Johnson did many things that upset conservatives such as the establishment of Medicare, providing funding and help for parochial schools, protecting the environment and generally providing programs for the betterment of the country. One wonders if Johnson hadn't failed so miserably in Vietnam if his policies would've had more long range success. In my opinion if there was no Vietnam then the policies of the Johnson administration would've become more in the political mainstream then it is now.  The Republican conservative movement wouldn't come to fruition until the '80s with the "Reagan Revolution". Unlike previous Republican policies of letting the market sort itself the Reagan policy was to be more involved by instituting tax cuts, huge defense spending and a linking with the elite of the corporate world. Reagan's policies was less about religion but it set the template for future Republican administrations. We are seeing the same kind of policies for the most part with the Bush admin. However G.W. Bush has added the element of neo-social conservatism where the social ethics and values are more religious and biblical in nature. A prime example of this was Bush's initiative of faith based funding. According to an episode of Bill Moyers NOW none of the faith based money went to organizations outside of Christianity.  As we can clearly see the differences between Liberalism and Conservatism is huge. The vast differences is what causes the confrontational aspect of the ideological battle. Conservatives view Liberals as legislative monsters who want to create a welfare society and increase taxation. Liberals see Conservatives as reckless with monetary policy, warhawks with a military fetish and  TOO  close-minded when it comes to social problems.  I've heard from conservatives that the problem with liberalism is that they advocate a governmental system that makes the people too dependent on the powers that be in Washington. It is my view however that the policies of conservative minded politicians are too distant and don't help the people when they generally need some kind of governmental intervention. We have seen the US middle class shrink considerably over the last four years because the Bush tax cuts target big corporations and the rich. The tax cuts that do go to the middle class are being offset by rising medical fees and state/local taxes rising. Sometimes there has to be a helping hand for the masses.  Well that does it for this two part look at conservatism and liberalism. Just so that people understand I'd say that I'm fiscally conservative (in some areas) while being a liberal in regards to social policy.

						   I would like to talk about the ideological battle between Liberalism and Conservatism. In the last few years the conservative movement has swiftly made its way into the mainstream. This to me is a somewhat troubling development as the Republican party has made it so hard to for the opposing views of the Democrats to be heard in a sane and reasonable way. The conservative movement is now a thinly amalgum of religion and politics. Sometimes religion can be a good thing in public life but it can cloud the judgment of those who espouse it.  The conservative movement that was started by Barry Goldwater in the 1960s was not one that made Evangilical Christianity the central tenet of the ideology. It was quite the contrary as the movement was more about advocating a strong defense while upholding moral and sensible values with the emphasis on government not playing a big role in the lives of people. It is lamentable that the current GOP has strayed so far from that central idea. It is now a party with a huge emphasis on religion as a backbone for decision making. Admittedly the US has gotten more conservative in tone after the Clinton presidency but the Republicans have taken the nation  TOO  far to the right.  I have heard from many right wing pundits that the Democrats and John Kerry especially are "liberal" as if it's a dirty word. I think we should look at the definitions of Conservative and Liberal and use some real world examples of how the two ideologies would handle two relevant issues today: the Iraq war and stem cell research    conservative: Favoring traditional views and values; tending to oppose change   Liberal:   1a) Not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or dogmas; free from bigotry.   1b) Favoring proposals for reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others; broad-minded.      As we can see the definition of a liberal is much more broad and in my opinion far more positive. What the definition of conservative fails to point out is the emergence of the  Religious  conservative. The religious conservative is even more intolerant of change and in some ways quite backward in thinking. Now let's take a look at how a liberal viewpoint and a conservative viewpoint would handle the Iraq war.  We all know what happened when President George W. Bush plunged America into war with Iraq. He masked his true reasoning with the bogeyman that is WMDs. Some have postulated that the true reason for the war was the fact that Neo-Conservatives want to see peace in the Middle East in order to bring about biblical prophesy. This may seem like a far fetched idea but considering the fact that most conservatives today are religious in their viewpoint then it should be no surprise. The other reason for Bush to fight the war was personal. In the mid '90s his father and family was almost assasinated by Saddam Hussein. This has been something that has gnawed on the younger Bush. It gnawed at him so much that the first order of business for the Bush administration was to come up with a workable warplan against Iraq.   The Liberal side wouldn't have jumped to conclusions and manipulate intelligence to fit their needs. One purported reason for going to war was the Iraq-Al Qaeda connection. It was originally said that a high ranking Al Qaeda member met with Iraqi officials before the 9/11 attacks but foriegn intelligence agencies all debunked this myth. In the run up to war President Bush urged Saddam to destroy his WMDs and in fact saddam WAS doing that with the help of inspectors. As I recall 75 or so Al-Samud missiles were being destroyed in the week or so before war. The Democratic or Liberal view was the continue the process of sending investigators and looking at the strategy of containment. After all it was containment that eventually doomed the Soviet Union. It may be a longer process than the war was but it would've been far more stable a situation then the one we have now.  Stem Cell research is another issue where we see a gulf in the views between conservatives and liberals. The conservative view is that the embryos are human life and shouldn't be destroyed while the liberal view is that the embryos have the POSSIBILITY to become sentient life but it is not and therefore should be used to cure some of the more dehibilitating diseases such as Alzheimers. I find it pretty funny in the midst of the election campaign that First Lady Laura Bush said:  ``I hope that stem-cell research will yield cures and therapies for a myriad of illnesses, But I know that embryonic stem-cell research is very preliminary, and the implication that cures for Alzheimer's are around the corner is just not right, and it's really not fair to the people who are watching a loved one suffer from this disease."  Yet at the same time she defends the limited funding for this vital research by saying  ``(it made it) possible for researchers to explore the potential of stem cells while respecting the ethical and moral implications''   The second statement is obviously aimed at those who support stem cell research. You can't have it both ways by saying you're morally against the research yet pointing to the restricted financing of said research as an achievement.  In my next post I will talk about why there is such animus between conservatives and liberals.

						   Well this is my first time doing something like this. I usually have a lot of thoughts on my mind so I thought that this would be the perfect place to put them for all the world to see. I guess I should tell everyone a little about myself and what kind of content this blog will have. I'm a 24 (almost 25) year old guy from Toronto, Canada. I was born with vision and hearing problems. I have survived that tho. There are lots of little things about my life that I hope to share. As for the content of this blog well it's going to be about my views on movies, TV, politics, life, sports, videogames and whatever strikes my fancy.  I shall make another post tomorrow and will attempt to add new commentary and such at least once a day.  So long for now.
