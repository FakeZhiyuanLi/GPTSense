       Well ladies and gentlemen, the project to raise funds to replace the van that was stolen and destroyed last weekend has ended as quickly as it has started.  I am happy to say that this story does, indeed, have a happy ending!  I just received the following news item in relation to the project:    FM 96.5 Listeners Come Through! Halifax, N.S. July 26/2004  FM 96.5 listeners rallied to the cause to help Jennifer Gallant, the Dartmouth single mother whose customized wheelchair accessible van worth $80,000 was stolen and then set on fire this past weekend.  Monday morning Griff and Donna each pledged $100 towards the cost of replacing the vehicle and FM 96.5 listeners were quick to follow suit. Griff and Donna were absolutely blown away by the support “By the end of the morning show, we have had calls from residents all over metro just wanting to help”, says Griff. Over $8,000 had been pledged by noon Monday.  Steele Ford heard about the cause and is donating a completely customized wheelchair accessible vehicle for the family.  Thank You to all the BIG HEARTS out there who made a donation to this effort. All dollars donated have been placed in trust for the family.    So, the Gallants will have a new fully accessible wheelchair van and will have $8,000 in trust as well to help them out.  Today is a VERY happy day!  :)  I would like to thank everyone who spread the URL for your time and caring.  For those who still want to donate to the trust fund, I will leave the website up and active for a week or so and you can make donations through the website and I will pass along the money received to the Gallant Trust Fund to assist them in the future.  Again, thanks to everyone for caring and getting behind me in this endeavour.  I am sorry we didn't get to see what could have been raised but at the same time, I am very excited that the goal has been achieved!  Thank You and have a great weekend!

       First of all, I'd like to wish my Dad a Happy 60th Birthday!  Dad turns 60 on Thursday July 29th and we are all looking forward to sharing some birthday cake with him!  Here's wishing you a great day, Dad and many more to come!  Secondly, I want to enlist  YOUR  help.  This is  VERY  important and I am hoping that each and every one of you can help in some way. Here's the story:  As I am sure some of you are aware, last weekend in Nova Scotia, a van belonging to a single mother and her seven year old son with cerebral palsy, was stolen.  This van was a wheelchair-accessible van and was worth over $80,000 and the insurance on the van does not cover theft.  To make matters worse, the van was found a couple of days ago and had been torched and was completely destroyed by fire.  Now, this 28-year old mother has no way to get her child to doctor's appointments and just to get out anywhere.  She cannot even afford a car, let alone a new accessible van.  This is something that they desperately need.  Let me make something clear, I do not know this young lady or her son.  I was just very much saddened to hear that someone could do something so evil that affects a disabled child.  I feel the need to try to do something to help.  The method I have chosen to help is to create my own website whereby people can donate money to help purchase a new van for this child.  The money will be handled by me and  every penny donated WILL go directly towards the purchase of a new wheelchair accessible van for this child .  I have created a PayPal donation button on my website that people can easily use to make a donation.  It is very easy and totally secure.  So, you're probably wondering how YOU can help?  Well, you can help in a couple of ways.  First of all, you can make a donation.  Even one dollar is a help.  Dollars add up quickly.  I know many of you cannot afford to donate money so the second option is critical.  I would appreciate it if all of you could forward the URL of the website to as many of your friends and family as possible.  Please inform them that this is a legitimate appeal and that you know the person directly who has created this page.  Please ask them to pass it on to as many people as they can as well.  Also, if you have access to any message boards where you think it would be appropriate, please post the website URL there as well so that we can get this thing moving and start getting the donations coming in.  The internet is a huge community and if this thing is put out there....potentially, millions of people can see the website.  If only 8% of those million people were to donate $1, then we would easily reach our goal of $80,000!  It  CAN  happen and  you can help make it happen!   So,  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, pass this URL along to anyone and everyone you think would be interested in seeing it and ask them to pass it along .  Every little bit will help and I thank you very much in advance.

Oh well...rain is better than snow, right?!  The hottest thing on the Internet is a two-minute Flash movie callled "This Land" chronicling the US Presidential Race between George W.

        I am going to learn how to do Flash™ Animation!    There, I said it!   For the longest time, I have wanted to learn how to do Flash™ animation so that I can further develop my desire to do websites. I have very limited experience in the web-design theater but after some recent encouragement from Angela and Matt, I have decided to put all of my efforts into learning more and am going to do my best to develop my own home-based business. This won't happen overnight and I realize that. It's going to take a lot of reading and learning and I am going to dedicate myself to it. I guess I am telling you this as sort of my way of having to do something about it. I mean, if I tell the world that I am going to learn Flash™ animation and learn how to make great websites and then I don't bother, then I will look silly in front of the whole world! This way, I will have an extra incentive to really dig in and learn this stuff!   As I learn new skills and am able to create something worthy of showing everyone, I will publish my works here on this site. I hope that you will provide me with feedback on the things that I create so that I may continue to improve my skills.   I have been dabbling in basic web-design for the past few years but have not really committed to learning the full range of skills that are needed to make a go of it so the sites that I have created have been from templates or created with limited skill required. Have a look at some of the websites that I have created in the past by clicking the links below:    urlLink Mark Driscoll Productions - Hollywood, California My first website, and to this day, the one I devote most of my time to.     urlLink Brookside Business - Summerside, PEI - Simple layout and clean design.     urlLink Charry's Karate - Thunder Bay, Ontario - Simple design for a karate school.    These are the websites that I currently work on. As time goes by and as I add others, I will post them on this site as well.   So...here goes nothing! I am hoping that I have some great work to show you soon! It's going to be an interesting learning experience for me!

       Welcome to my first restaurant review.&nbsp; Over time, I will be writing reviews of the restaurants on PEI as well as those off-Island that I happen to visit.&nbsp; I hope you find them helpful and informative when making your choice of where to eat when you go out on the town.  &nbsp;         &nbsp;  Our first stop is  urlLink Off Broadway  in Old Charlottetown.&nbsp; Now, let me begin by saying that Off Broadway is not a spot to go to grab a quick snack.&nbsp; This is fine dining, folks.&nbsp; Leave the cut-off shorts and tank-tops at home as Off Broadway is formal dining at it's finest in PEI.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Specializing in steak, seafood, crepes, &amp; luscious homemade desserts, Off Broadway is a charming restaurant  urlLink located in Old Charlottetown, PEI .&nbsp;&nbsp; Once inside, you'll notice the atmosphere is just right with it's softly lit dining room and the individual tables set up in such a way as to provide privacy to the diner.&nbsp;   Apart from knowing nothing about fine dining, I felt right at home when I was seated.&nbsp; The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to assist you in any way possible.&nbsp; Other restaurants in Charlottetown could definitely take lessons on customer service from the staff of Off Broadway.  The  urlLink menu  was a tad intimidating to me.&nbsp; Being someone who tends to frequent establishments like McDonald's and Subway as a general rule, I was quite perplexed at most of the menu items.&nbsp; It was a good thing that my date was quite cultured and well-versed in the fine-dining menu.&nbsp; She assisted me in picking out items that I had never tried but that I enjoyed immensely.&nbsp;   For starters, we ordered the baked brie which came topped with a warm raspberry sauce.&nbsp; I had never had, nor had I heard of baked brie previous to this excursion so I wasn't sure what to expect from this appetizer. I was very pleasantly surprised as it was delicious.&nbsp; One order was more than sufficient for the two of us to share as we didn't want to fill up too much before the main course.  We ordered a couple of drinks and then it was on to the main course.&nbsp; Again, I wasn't sure what I was going to order so my date assisted me again and we both ordered the Chicken Divan Crepes.&nbsp; Allow me to tell you that this had to be one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted.&nbsp; It was done perfectly and was a delight to the tastebuds.&nbsp; In fact, when my date couldn't finish all of hers, I quickly ( but discreetly ) snatched hers up and made short work of it.&nbsp; Definitely a must-have if you visit Off Broadway.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dish also came with the Soup of the Day which was Carrot Soup.&nbsp; Now, I thought that sounded pretty un-appealing and when the hostess brought it over to the table, it looked like orange strained carrots that you would get in a baby food bottle.&nbsp; My date tasted it and she said it was really good.&nbsp; I tried it and it was amazing.&nbsp; It was absolutely delicious!&nbsp; I am definitely ordering it next time.&nbsp; Highly recommended!  For desert, we ordered a single Banana Torte to share between us.&nbsp; Now, I love bananas and assumed that I would love this desert but I was, unfortunately, disappointed with the Banana Torte.&nbsp; It had no banana flavor to it whatsoever and was quite bland to be perfectly honest.&nbsp; It was basically a pie crust with whipped cream on it.&nbsp; At least that's what it looked and tasted like.&nbsp; So, I would recommend you try something different if you partake in desert.&nbsp; My date ordered a Monte Christo Coffee which she tells me was delectable.&nbsp; I, personally, do not like coffee.  Of course, at this point, you're probably wondering how much all of this costs?&nbsp; Well, I am not going to tell you the total of the bill but let me say that it was definitely lower than I had expected and was well worth every penny.&nbsp; A wonderful meal in a fantastic atmosphere for a price that is hard to beat for what you receive.&nbsp;   In summary, Off Broadway is an excellent restaurant with high class atmosphere and cuisine, extremely pleasant and helpful staff, and value that is hard to beat.&nbsp; I definitely give Off Broadway my full recommendation and suggest you check it out sometime.   I give Off Broadway 5 Stars out of 5.

       Well, it's happened once again.  Prince Edward Island's chance to host a major event and take us out of the dark ages and into the present has been dashed by "poor ticket sales".  In my opinion, this was our one big shot at drawing some major concert events in the future and it appears the chance has been blown, big time!  I am not really sure where the fault lies in this whole issue but one of the big problems, if we can believe the story the promoter is giving about poor ticket sales, then we, the ticket buyers and fans are partially responsible.  Tell me where else in North American could you see a ten-hour rock concert headlined by Default, Fountains of Wayne, Five For Fighting, and Train for a mere $30?  I'll tell you where...NOWHERE!  This is the lowest price you'll ever see for a concert of this magnitude.  If people couldn't be bothered buying a ticket to a concert like this for such a low price, then we don't deserve to have something like this come to PEI.  I also feel a large part of the fault lies with the promoter.  Aside from their well-done website, the Rock The Island event had very little promotion.  I never heard it mentioned on the radio.  There were no newspaper ads except for the actual story that announced the concert.  In fact, as recently as two days before the cancellation of the event, I had friends who didn't even know the concert existed.  A huge concert and people on this small Island hadn't even heard of it?  Now that's poor promotion!  And tell me this.  Last week, the newspaper quoted the promoter as saying that tickets were "selling fast".  This was also stated on the website.  They also said that over 7,000 of the 15,000 tickets were already sold.  If this were the case, why did they cancel the concert this week over poor ticket sales?  Why did they do an interview for the paper last week making it look like everything was going smoothly?  Certainly, they had to have been seriously considering cancelling the show at that point, yet they made the concert look like it was definitely a go.  Boo to the promoters for duping us into believing that this was actually going to happen.  So, Prince Edward Island, it looks like we are doomed to be a dark-ages, back-woods province who never gets anything big here because we don't bother to support it when it does come here.  Perhaps the promoters should have first called WWE Owner Vince McMahon and asked him what ticket sales are like here in PEI.  The last WWE house show in PEI had about 300 people there *ESTIMATE ONLY*.  All I can say is...Sad..really really sad.  Shame on us.  I guess we will have to continue travelling to Halifax and Moncton for the big events...they know how to support large scale entertainment events.  So the concert ain't happenin'!  Remember...if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!  Doc  Below is the official cancellation of the Rock The Island Festival from their website:   ROCK THE ISLAND FESTIVAL CANCELLED    The dismal North American Summer Concert Touring season has found its way to the shores of PEI.  With great disappointment the organizers for Rock the Island have announced that the August 1 festival on Prince Edward Island has been cancelled.  “Our vision and passion, while shared by a great many people, has been no match for the North American wide reality of slow advance ticket sales in the concert touring industry, particularly with the outdoor festival concept,” Producer David Carver said. “We tried to keep the event alive using every strategy possible, however in the end, the poor advance ticket sales combined with a suffering tourism season has forced us to cancel the festival.”   ALL TICKETS TO BE REFUNDED  All tickets can be refunded starting Wednesday, July 14 through the original point of purchase, at the Jungle Jims stores in Maritime Canada, Mikes Restaurant in Fredericton, Radioland in Charlottetown, Av Entertainment in Summerside or Radio Shack in Montague.  All processed credit card orders by phone and online will be refunded directly to the credit card.  NOTE: ALL ONLINE PURCHASE REQUESTS FOR TICKETS AND CAMPSITES WERE NOT PROCESSED AND THEREFORE THERE WILL BE NO CHARGES APPLIED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD.   urlLink Click Here for Official Rock The Island Concert Cancellation Announcement
