        daryl always surprises me.      there are times when i crave his affection. when we first met, i cherished each brush stroke of his fingertip across my waiting cheek, his hand on my neck, light caresses on my arms. something has changed since then. he has never been one to exasperate loving phrases --when they come, i lose my breath.  finally. my heart has waited for you.  then it is gone for awhile longer --could come sooner, or it may be a longer wait than before. and the touch --yes, his magic touch, though he himself does not know it's full effect on me. anyone passionately in love knows this feeling of whirling butterflies tickling your skin, your insides, feeding the maddened beating of your heart. his touch does this. and that feeling is so sought after.       until lately. i've noticed he has reached for me lately :::tears:::   he has reached for me when i didn't expect it, came to sit by me when i thought i needed to give him space. that space that is so hard to give! i feel his energy when he is near and long for its return. i hold myself back from touching him all the time --his hair is so soft and yields wonderfully to my fingertips. his skin is supple, flawless and firm underneath my exploring fingers. his scent draws me closer, intoxicating like the feel of his lips in a smoldering embrace. all these things that i experience, i wish he would experience as well.      his words always captivate me. an insight to his innermost self --that's when it comes out. the rest of daryl is reserved, protected, his own inner circle of light and mystery. and i wait until i am allowed to glimpse the depth which ebbs from his tides. look at his eyes closely and you will see. there is a greatness in him that i will always believe in and draw from in my own moments of weakness.      that is my daryl

      it's been awhile since i've written.&nbsp; i have meant to purge my system many times, but for some reason just never sat down to write.  my personal drama with the family ensues, although not as intensely.&nbsp; i felt that my mother was distant, aloof...and i haven't even spoken to my father since the whole money issue erupted.&nbsp; today though my mother seemed&nbsp; more her old self, which was very reassuring.  summer finals are over with.&nbsp; i made it through second organic with a B --a great relief after my disastrous beginning, and at the same time disappointing -- i know i could have earned an A.&nbsp; i didn't jump start my study habits until the third test.&nbsp; a B is nothing to scoff at, either, considering half the class either dropped or "stuck in there" to make a D.&nbsp; still ...i don't know why i don't live up to my potential at times.&nbsp; it took me years to acknowledge the fact that if i didn't try, i couldn't risk failing.&nbsp; but that isn't the way to a successful and meaningful existence, is it?&nbsp;   i realized this summer that i'm a little bit of an existentialist, absolutist, relativist, utilitarianist with a belief in master and slave morality.&nbsp; how is all this possible?&nbsp; don't ask!&nbsp; obviously a few lessons in philosophy crept under my dusty carpet.&nbsp; i found aspects that i was newly introduced to and some that i always believed in but never stated into words.&nbsp; interesting-- the thoughts of great minds throughout the centuries literally at our fingertips.&nbsp; so much of it unappreciated by so many people.&nbsp; those that are complacent with a dull existence lacking knowledge and a soul's euphoria, for certainly it cannot be gained simply by sitting in a large room once a week singing praises to a God that serves only when convenient.&nbsp;   ramblings.&nbsp; that's the whole point of all this, eh?&nbsp; when is it during our lifetime that we really begin to see ourselves?&nbsp; and when do we stop?&nbsp;  don't stop.

      ...royally, i did.  there are certain lessons all of us must learn in life.  some are moral, some are social, and there are also the general lessons that enable us to live independently and succesfully (on a relative basis).  when it comes to managing finances, it took me about 8 years before i realized that i can't continue to spend now and pay later.  sure, i always  knew  that, but i didn't start consistently acting upon it until much too late.  and the end result?  i'm in over my head, my parents have to bail me out until i can repay them.  the cost?  sacrifice of pride, risking the reputation of my beloved (who is  not  to blame), making my father --who works his ass off as it is -- consider taking on a second job.  a second job?  this is the point in my parents' lives when they should be enjoying a leisurely life.  they both deserve it, much more than i do.  they've worked hard since way before i came into their lives.  but instead they work and budget to continue paying for certain living expenses for me while also paying for my Upnth year of college, just waiting for the day i graduate and become a successful professional.  then they can rest.  and daryl.  poor daryl, taking the brunt for something that isn't even in his control.  if anything he offers me guidance and self-control, which doesn't always stay in my head when it should.  how do i resolve this?  what can i do to ammend the relationship between the person i love and hope to spend eternity with and those who sacrifice so much for me?    ...who said life was easy, eh? i'm done for now.  too many thoughts are racing through my head.

      ...washes over me.  reminds me of a time when i lay to find the stars still shone above, feel the hand of a loved one glide over me with the summer breeze.  all was beautiful.  all was still.  what was that penetrating from within?  unfamiliar, though welcome.  it coursed in my veins, throbbed in my temples and overfloweth my senses.  love, they call it.  was that you?  yes, it is Love, in all her splendor and quiet presence.  not boastful or lewd.  the gentle slope of a woman's breast, the firmness found in a man's chest...together they are beautiful, united and glorious, cast in moonlight, bathed in passion.  come, gentle rain...

           A new dawn arises.  What will we do with this day?  Some people are dying, some are starving, some are living lavishly but lacking soul requisites.  What shall I do with my allotted time this day?  Reflect.  That is why I decided to create this thing-called-blog.  Over the years I've ignored my brain and my spirit, forgot I need room to stretch out my wings and dust off the webs.  Mere intellectual study is not sufficient.  Minds need circles of thought before they can arive at new geometric anomalies of wonder and unchartered territories.  In my thirst I feel I've become someone I have never admired...shallow.  Does my spirit only run ankle deep?  I don't know myself anymore, so how can I expect my loved ones to understand me?  Depth.  ░░OxYgEn░░ Be truthful and ye shall find yourself within.   What will you do with this day?
