      I mentioned these things to myself recently.  They are my feelings told to our abusers.  ---  There are things we hide.  I hide emotions and thoughts from you.  You hide your own pain.  I’ve become a somewhat altered being towards you through my distrust and through coping mechanisms that I’ve set up for myself.  Some of these mechanisms are natural, some of them are unhealthy.    Real consequences that have effected now over 6 women in our family.  People are on medication, seeking psychiatric treatment, attempting suicide and having violent thoughts of revenge.  Intimacy problems, panic attacks, post traumatic stress, anxiety attacks, depression and irritable bowl syndrome affect us.  A lack of trust has emerged.  Hiding has made those around you distrust permanently.  New light has been shed upon your behavior throughout your life because now we are getting a picture of the abuse you sustained.  Grandpa is a pedophile and a predator.  Through weakness of character, he has been allowed to victimize.  Palpable damage has been sustained.  We see that you and your brother are a network of support for this hiding.  Neither of you has risen to fight such an effective negative force in our lives.  Our father’s life was influenced by your deception.  His feelings were affected and his investment in our family changed because of your disposition.  You and your brother played a role of influence in his life.  We’re not interested in hiding your deeds.  The effects of your behavior have changed our perceptions and our lives permanently.  Your lack of interest in addressing our feelings has promoted anger and altered the course of our relationships.  We recognize that you were also victims.  We are not alone, although our mindsets are different.  Your ACTION has spoken for you.  You have failed to act in ways consistent with the defense of your babies.  We feel disappointment in you.  We feel lied to and played by you.  We feel abandoned by you.  We feel effected by you.  We feel sentenced to a life of our minds being dominated by our confusion surrounding your behavior.  We think of you constantly.  We feel manipulated by these thoughts.  We have sustained physical abuse.  We know your behaviors were wrong.  We are not interested in justifications.  These things hurt us.  We acknowledge loving acts put forth by you.  We do not deem you devils.  Rather than compensate, these things have served to confuse us.  This confusion transpired while we were children and were of weak moral conscience.  We resent this sort of advantage taking.  You have been dethroned as experts.  Our minds have crossed a line.  Our feelings are no longer susceptible to the same manipulation that they once were.  We acknowledge that you have feelings too.  We do not trust that you are revealing them to us.  Rather, we feel you are showing us what you wish we would believe.  We feel you are incapable of gathering the courage to discuss reality.  Your commitment to this sort of behavior and this thought process indicates to us your unwillingness to accept our positions.  We do not feel that you are interested in addressing the reality that is the way we feel.  All of us are fed up with communication that is ineffectual.  We have lost faith in our ability to be heard.  We attribute this to the extent to which you are protecting yourself from the pain of the truth.  We feel you were not aware of, or did not accept that we have made clear and justified identifications of the sexual predatory nature of some of your behaviors.  We are weary of having children.  If we do, we do not trust them with you.  This is due to the fact that we saw you choose for us that which terrorizes us.  We are uncomfortable being happier to be away from you than around you.  You deny what is obvious to us.  Our unnatural relationships with you hide our true selves.  We are intimidated by you.  We are different, enjoyable people when away from you.  Your inability to recognize this has left us with a sense that you are not interested in knowing us.  Only interested in the semblance of us that fits this schema of fraud.  This leaves us longing.  We have realized the extent to which this fraud serves to warm otherwise cold feelings that surround our family interactions.  Through our exploration of our feelings, we see the root of our coping mechanism in you.  As we notice that this type of fraud is inconsistent with our sense of joy, we feel disappointed that you are so interested in prolonging such unhealthy behavior.  We have sought through our actions to draw attention to our ill feelings.  These actions themselves are ill and are marked by our ability to hurt ourselves for your acceptance.  We do not feel that our grandfather’s sexual predation is excusable.  We suffer to come to grips with a boundary that our own parents were unwilling to set.  Our anger about the subject suggests that that boundary be harsh.  We feel that malice has entered your hearts.  We feel that your insulting degrading behavior is important to you because it allows you to hide your pain.  We see through your actions that it is supremely important to you to hide your pain.  We feel that admitting your wrongs is now less important to you than the warm feeling of protection that this malice generates.  We understand that your pain must be great.  We believe that you feel that it would be too painful to reveal.  We see that you choose to remain cloaked, and continue abuse, rather than uncover your pain and deal with it.  This leaves us feeling desperate about the future of our relationships with you.  We know we cannot continue in this fashion with you.  Because we have no other experience, we fear going forward without you.  This confusion dominates our daily lives.  Most of us have reached a point where we would rather be dead, or poor, or without relationships with you, or have our children without grandparents, than continue this type of progression.  Our desperation is palpable and at this point, is actionable.  We recognize and appreciate the good memories we have of our families.  We are haunted by our memories of abuse and confusion.  We rarely know what to do with such feelings.  We recognize your intelligence.  We are confounded by your treatment of ours.  We don’t understand why our feelings are so easy for you to cast aside.  This shows itself in the logistics of our relationships.  We have recognized a pattern.  Semantics and language are things that you attack.  You attempt to deny the value of our words with specific attacks on our placement and usage.  We see this as follows: rather than deal with the feelings being communicated, you attack the communication itself.  Because of this, we fear that our communication will never be effective.  We have all sought to numb our pain with self destructive action.  This is in stark contrast to each of our known mental ability.  Your desire to hide from us the truth about the abusive nature or your family has led us to distrust your descriptions of other family events.  We have recognized the pattern by which you have each systematically abused your spouses.  Although we disrespect their ability to defend themselves and us, we notice that they too have been victims of your designs.

      I've got a mother.  She's abusive and lost.  I have a father.  He's dead.  There's more to this.  I have one sister; aunts, uncles and cousins, too.  In the past eleven months, I've learned much about my family.  All of my life I've learned a lot about abuse.  My life has been tumultuous, rewarding, aloof, introspective and short.  My family has been loving, shitty, memorable and broken.   I have a difficult relationship with my mother.  She is my abuser.  She emotionally abuses me.  She psychologically abuses me.  She is verbally abusive.  She abuses anyone close.  She was abused.  My story is not magnanimous or unique, it's just mine.  Right now, we don't speak.  I speak with my sister and some in my family who don't close the door.  We're sad right now, as a collective.  Here's why.  My father was killed.  He showed his love for us as kids and we haven't forgotten it.  The death caused an implosion within my nuclear family.  My mother was consumed with anger.  My sister and I were shocked and left to drift.  My sister was married.  Then my cousin called.  Lets call her Jill.  Jill wanted to know if I'd speak with her.  We were headed to see her for a family wedding.  She mentioned that her time spent at home and under the thumb of a controlling father was getting to her.  I had moved away from my disapproving mother when I was twenty after a failed stint away at school.  She had need for this experience.  We talked.  Jill told me she had been sexually abused as a child.  Our grandfather had forced himself on her when she was young.  She had called it a bad dream since.  Then she described her life with her own father.  It paralleled mine, but worse.  She described physical abuse.  Beatings.  She described the same psychological abuse I had sustained.  We cried together.  Then we spoke with my sister.  She had warded off sexual approaches by my grandfather.  Jill revealed that my mother had approached her and admitted being a victim of his sexual abuse, too.  Jill told me about her mother, my aunt.  She had been preyed upon.  She told me of a cousin of her father... and who knows where it ends.  A predator in our family had robbed every woman of some part of her dignity.  The men weren't left alone either.  I'm working with a counselor.  Jill is working with a counselor.  My sister is working with a counselor.  Our abusers don't know we know.  I'm exausted by it.

      Why not?  I'm feeling a bit out of sorts.  This weblog comes in the middle of turmoil.  I'm wondering about the future.  I have a past.  I'm recording, for your insight and for my life.  I'm abused.  I'm finding something in writing.  I hope you find me here, but if you find yourself... tell me where you are.
