       During Lunch Lexx asked me to show him how to play, so I took my best Deck and cut it in half and gave it to him.  in 3 turns he had me to 200 life points  on the 4th turn he had me at -6100 life points...  ouch! guess my deck is in need of a little shoring up from  quick damage attacks...

       I got up as Peach was getting up to go to work, (she gets up at 5:00 because she has to be at work at 6:30) told her I couln't go back to sleep but I guess I did because at 7:00 my alarm was going off and I still wasn't out of bed, got up, took a bath, decided I would stop by Bob's Restaurant and get me some breakfast, when I got to the Office about 8:05, I noticed there was no cars in the lot except the AC guys who have been installing new AC all week for our office  he was apparently still waiting to get in and I'm like "Biddit should be here" so I unlocked the Door and let him in, about 5-10 mins later Est came in and I asked him where Biddit was and he said "oh, he's off for the rest of the week.." I'm just wondering why our QA person/Project manager doesn't like to Email people telling them this info.. anyways I think that's enough for now... I'll write more as things happen...

       lets see I'll tell you a little bit about myself and introduce you to our cast of characters.  I'm 34, I grew up in a little town called Springfield, Ohio. My nickname came from some "Aquaintences" I had in High School where most nicknames start, I guess I got it because I was very distant and acted like I was on Acid all the time. Had a friend named Freon that actually did freon, (yes the cold stuff you put in your AC) it lowered his voice whenever he did it I thought of it like reverse helium. anyways, I currently work in a Web Development firm for the timeshare industry. here are the people in my life right now... (Names changed to keep this safe...)  Mom (I moved her out here from Cali after my Father passed away becuase money was tight)  Peach (my Current GF) just moved to town from Georgia because of a job move, we live together)  AAGirl (Peaches Niece) lives with us.. needs to stop smoking and needs to see drinking and driving is bad...  Lexx (my Direct Supervisor), a cool guy, has all the looks most women want, and the personality to go with it  Est (Co worker), cool guy, knows alot about Oracle DB's and is my go-to guy when things get wierd in code  Biddit (Another Coworker) our QA Guy, really gets on my nerves and a few other peoples here too but he has this personality that you can't stay mad at for long  Anim (Yet another Co Worker) does Comic books and is my co-on-call person  Bjork (Owner of our company) cool guy from out of the country.
