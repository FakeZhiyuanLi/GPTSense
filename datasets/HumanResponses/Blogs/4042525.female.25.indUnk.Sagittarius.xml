      My fashion show was a great success, and we won some cool and groovy things.  But, most of all we helped to motivate other women on their paths of nursing.  Peace and Breastfeeding bliss, Merry Part Krys

       urlLink Blue Moons    Well this weekend there will be a few important things happening.&nbsp; Friday Terrance and I will be in a fashion show to show support for Breastfeeding.&nbsp; Then Saturday night is the Blue Moon, the second full moon to fall in the month of July.&nbsp; It is also the Fall Equinox or Lammas.&nbsp;   This is the time of the year that the first crops of the season were normally brought in--corn, wheat, and barley.&nbsp; This signals the begining of the three harvest seasons.&nbsp;   Cornbread, Blackberries, bread made from newly harvested grains, and grain ale, honey, and pork are some of the foods that are associated with this Sabbat-or holiday. This is the time of the Mother Goddess while she is pregnant with the God who will be reborn arounf Yule.&nbsp;   This is the holiday to honor the first fruits from the farm.&nbsp; You can have canning parties to preserve the bounties from your garden if you have one.&nbsp; You can have a party and have your guests come as farmers and bring pot luck&nbsp;dishes made from vegetables.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh melons are yet another food that is taken in during the first harvest.   You could take moment when you are outside saturday night to gaze at the stars, there are many wonderful sights to see on this evening,&nbsp;who knows you might see a shooting star or&nbsp;two.   Have a wonderful Lammas, and may your harvest season be plentiful!   Krys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       So, I just cannot say enough positive things for this Blogging&nbsp; thing.&nbsp; I have been looking for a way to share my pictures with my family and friends.&nbsp; I do not think that websites are as easy as some people say.&nbsp; This is a far better showcase for my family photos.&nbsp; On top of the fact that I think I can see my son doing one of his own when he figures out the typing and spelling thing.   This is an undiscovered frontier, I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I hope to be adding maybe on a weekly basis........

      It never ceases to amaze me that some things can wear you down.&nbsp; I just wish there were other ways of taking care of the boredom of the average day than the droning on of the moments when you are restless and cannot settle down and do the simplest of tasks.&nbsp; I have this issue sometimes that I cannot focus on even the easiest taasks that involve sitting down and doing something.&nbsp; So I wind up pacing and looking for something to do or watch.&nbsp;

       I just thought that I would start off with a bit of a welcome.&nbsp; I just found out about this thing-a-mijigger.&nbsp; I think that it would be a good idea, as I have been looking for a sure fire way to share my photos with friends and family.&nbsp; Allthough, I do admit to being a bit unsure about sharing the journaled moments with strangers.&nbsp; However, maybe it is just the&nbsp; outlet that I need.&nbsp; Maybe sharing with strangers is the way to go.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So, welcome to my mind.&nbsp; I am a 25 year-old stay at home mom.&nbsp; I have a 2 year old son named Terrance--more commonly known as Tazzie-- and my long term boyfriend and partner in this parenthood gig--Drew.&nbsp; He is a DJ at the Top O' Mast.&nbsp; He spins for the beach.....Ft Myers Beach, FL.&nbsp; A great vacation spot......for anybody who might be headed this way.&nbsp;     I spend my days chasing my kid about, and of course there is that constant task of housework.&nbsp; But, all of it is surprisingly reassuring.&nbsp; Finally I have found the dream job I have always wanted.&nbsp; Then there is the chance for extending my studies of my craft.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have the time to be able to perfect&nbsp;all of my talents.     &nbsp;   I even enjoy hanging out at one of the best Pagan message boards...PaganPath.com     &nbsp;   I also occasionally find the time to hop on my lovely red and black Specialized Hard Rock.&nbsp; Granted, now I have to attach the trailor, but, I have noticed that&nbsp; my son enjoys those speedbumps.&nbsp; Don't know why, but, I guess it could considered a blast for a 2 yr old.
