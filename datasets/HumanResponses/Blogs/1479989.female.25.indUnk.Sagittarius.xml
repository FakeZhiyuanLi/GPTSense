      okay so this was my dream the night before last (thursday night).  i dreamt about bouncer and his girlfriend.  i guess that she had found out that he was hitting on me and started yelling at me.  i tried to make her my friend, but it didn't work.  she was acting all stupid.  she was sad and cried.  bouncer denied me and made me feel stupid.  i was really upset.  i think she lived in a sororiety house and i think i was trying to get in it.  i was with someone.  probably TLB, because she would be the only person (well aside from bebo) who would be risky and crazy enough to go on a mission like that with me.  i can't remember the details anymore.  but yeah, i just was trying to get to her.  and hurt that bouncer treated me like dirt.    dreamt about spiders after that.  dreamt that there were tons of spiders and i had to kill them.  and there were just so many.  just all over the place.  i needed to try to kill them as fast as i could.  then there was a part that i was running and i ran through a giant spider web.  i was freaking out.  so grossed out and trying to get the web off of me.  then i noticed that there was a giant spider.  and i was like.. EEEEEEKKKKKKK!!! and tried to run away.  so yeah.  i can't remember what happened next.    stupid spider man movie.  it must have come from that.

      man i really need to stop taking these damn afternoon naps!!! urgh.  just so tired.  so here goes.  i only remember bits and pieces and they are slowly fading away as i type.   i guess we were in hawaii.  or something like that.  TLB was there and i was really happy about it.  for some reason she was staying at a hotel w/ some other friends?  i wasn't staying at my house either.  i was staying w/ the aloha crew for some reason.  Aloha and vas was there.  i think chicken was there too.  i'm not sure.  i can't remember.  so we were hanging out and i was trying to ignore vas, because i didn't want to go that same road again of our stupid relationship, plus i didn't want to get rejected.  hmmm.  then i think i had to pick up TLB.  i don't remember what happened next but the scene changed and we were going to the club.  and my ex iceman was there.  and he had his new girl.  i think i may have been a tiny bit jealous, but we were good friends so i got over it.  there were other breakers there.   oh yeah, there was a part that i was taking a shower and i was naked and there was some sort of YFC or SFC praise event that my aunt was throwing and they were letting people in.  so i had to grab the rug from the floor and use it as a towel to cover my nakedness.   so back to the club, i guess i had to get through the club to get TLB.  i got distracted by some breakdancer lesbians.  they were the butch kind.  one kept hitting one me.  i kept calling one of them liz.  then i dunno we walked back to the hawaii house.  then we were at the hawaii house and it was stalker's house.  but he wasn't stalker, he was crackhead.  it was so weird.  so i told the manager that i was crackhead's gf and he let us stay here.  then me TLB and princess were hanging out in his room.  and someone came in.  it was a hot guy.  i don't know who, but i knew him.  so i wanted to fool around.  then it gets even weirder.   stalker (who is now himself) comes in.  and he gets mad that there's another guy there and they start arguing.  then it gets even weirder.  he says, well what if the circumstances were different.  and then it rewinds and there's more people coming into the room and it was if other people came and if stalker hadn't come until a different time.  then different results, worse results than the prior scenario.  then stalker changed it again.  he says what if the friends that u invited to my house weren't friends and were gangstas?  and different gangstas from different gangs.  then different people started coming into the room.  each time it would rewind and people would go backwards and the scene would start again.  this time, i noticed one of the new people come in with a gun and someone else had a gun and i knew they were enemies.  so i ran out.  i didn't know where TLB or princess were.  i ran through a hallway and reached neighbor's room (stalker's neighbor in the dream; the hot boy).  then i kept telling him to lock the door before it was too late, because stalker was gonna come charging through it any minute.  he couldn't, the locks were broken.  then i don't remember what happened next. all of a sudden, i see stalker w/ a gun and he's trying to go after me.  but he wasn't stalker but a deranged psycho killer.  he was stalker, but he had turned to a deranged psycho killer.  he saw me.  and all of a sudden tlb was in the picture and she jumped at him and tried to distract him.  he shot her while i tried to escape.  i tried to go back but i think she said to run.  i did, and all of a sudden, he was in front of me.  telling me scary stories.  then i didn't know who it was.  i think it was still stalker but he had changed.  he had a towel over his head (like when athletes sweat and they put a towel on their head and the sides hang down).  i couldn't see his face and he was holding me, and i couldn't get away.  then i opened my eyes telling myself it was a dream.  and i couldn't wake up.  i kept staring at the towel and the hidden face beneath.  i couldn't see the face, but i didn't want to see the face.  i had a feelign i had my eyes open but everything was blurry.  i didn't know what to do.  it was laughing at me.  then the phone rang and i turned my head and it was tlb.  i woke up.  omg.  it was crazy.  when i hung up the phone with her, i turned my head again and realized that when i thought i was awake and had my eyes open, i was right.  what i was looking at (when i was thinking about the psycho w/ a towel over his head) was my chair.  i had slung the towel over it after i showered this morning.  it could have looked like a face because of it's shape.  but omg.  how scary.  i was staring at it the whole time, trying to wake up, believing that it was a psycho killer waiting for a wrong move.  thank god tlb for ur phone call.  omg.  this was a crazy ass dream.
