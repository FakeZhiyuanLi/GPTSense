      I realize today that there are many nice things in Bakersfield; lots of trees, good parks, the marketplace, occasional Farmers Markets, and my side of town (the good part). Today, people and organizations who have made Bakersfield beautiful will be honored in a ceremony tonight. These people earned the possibility to possibly recieve an award based on thier achievements. This morning, my mother and myself helped set up boards illustrating said achievements (Mom's on the advisory board). It will be televised live tonight on chammel 17, NBC. My parents are attending. My big brother and I will be eating pizza, and Sol will be at home sleeping. Have a great night!

      This wonderful evening of laughter and swimming was ended harshly with the new reality that is TCBY. On the way home for our grandmotherâ€™s house, my Big brother and myself decided to go to TCBY to get a smoothie and milkshake. Much to our disdain, the service was minimal and I must say, appalling. I ordered a 'Berry Blast' smoothie and it turns out the ice was all frozen together, so the worker had to go the nearby Sonic to retrieve some ice to make my nonetheless watery smoothie. Right now, my smoothie is busy hardening in the freezer. In conclusion, BOYCOTT TCBY!!

           Almost everyone in this era has an agenda. I enjoy that. I enjoy the fact that I can have an agenda. I hate election years, I got a call yesterday from, yes, John Kerry, I know, of all people, he calls some 16-year-old girl in central California, but alas, I was overly excited, it was... a recording! I know! How in the world does he expect anyone to vote for him if he doesn't call every regestered Democrat in the country and beg? I remember getting a call from Ahnold the Gubenator too at election time. Explanation: my mom is a registered Democrat, and my dad is a liberal, but still, a registered Republican, whatever. My younger brother freaked out when he called, I don't think he realized that Ahnold wasn't being rude when he didn't answer my brothers persistant questions. Poor kid.        I watched an interview with Michael Moore this morning on Today. He said that he's anti-Democrat, and yet ridicules the Republican party and the Bushes. What is he? Communist? Independant? Heaven forbid, Green? Oy! I will be happy, just as long as Georgey Bush Jr. (yes I know 'George Walker Bush' is no junior) doesn't get a second term! I don't like Kerry that much either, I was really pushing for Gen. Clark, but PLEASE NO MORE BUSH!!!!! Thank You!

      I read today that the some bloggers are invited to the Democratic Convention, I wish I could go, but its a) on the other side of the country and b) I am not eligible to vote because, well, I'm not yet 18. I wish I was, I really want to vote. Anyway, I think that it's pretty neat that these bloggers get to go, they are a form of journalism, people read thier stuff, it makes sense.  Oh, I wish I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner! That is what i'd truly like to be! For if I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner, Everyone would be in love with me!!  I don't even like hot dogs, or B-O-L-O-G-N-A, all those commercials did for me is teach me to spell bologna. Oy!  read  urlLink THIS !!

      I am watching ER and in the plot there are a few girls covered in cow blood. They were protesting the use of cats in lab testing. I once dissected a kitten. In Biology Freshman year. Yeah, I had a great teacher, Mrs. Bruce I LOVED her, she was awesome, she failed me, but she was great. My Big brother is going off to church camp today, I will be very bored without him. Oh well, I'll still have Sol, but all he does is sleep, I guess thats what you do when you're 8 and incredibly lucky. I wish we were back in school already, I am so bored already. I really have no one to hang with because I disowned my "friends" and I guess I feel bad about it. My two ex-friends Jess and Jack are most likely spending every moment possible together, I don't know if that is really unusual, but they've gotten really close... Hmmm, I wish I had a good book to read, but I still have overdue library books, good for me.  My dad's friend just had a baby Saturday, I wish a had a baby to play with, there is no one else, except Sol, but again, He's sleeping. I want to know what they named thier newborn, I know it's a girl, she was 2 weeks early. Okay, I will get back to my ER. More Later...

      My Brother has taken to using the following words : "Ghetto", "Pimp", and other slang words of that type. I have read the dictionary definitions to him, and still utilizes them in has everyday vocabulary. Frankly, I find it highly inappropriate for my 14-year-old brother to use these words. Whatever. We bought fireworks today, so exciting. Yeah, right. We are being subjected to my dad's friends 4th of July party for the second year in a row. Oy. And my grandmother is coming. More fun. *sigh*

      Yesterday, I was asked to complete an online poll for Harris Poll Online. The email claimed that for ten minutes, you will get 30 HIpoints (you get points for the polls you take). However, by completing that poll, the sucker you in for another, "Would you like to answer another poll [approx. 30 min.], for an additional 200 HIpoints?" Of Course I would! I have no life and all the time in the world! So I did, and it was very time consuming and BORING! So, after I finished that one, "Would you like to answer another poll [approx. 10 min.], for an additional 50 HIpoints, making a total of 250 HIpoints?" Well, duh! If I did the last one, why wouldn't I do this one? So I did. I will never do that again... Oh, who am I kidding, I can't turn down a $5 giftcard to The Olive Garden for 800 HIpoints! I need more, more, more... !     I am such a sucker...

      I am working with a guy at school to create a website for my school band. We need a name, really, we are in desperate need. We are a Competitive Band, but we have no name. Oy, our school is Highlnad HS, our mascot is the Scotsmen, and the name of the actual marching band is the Royal Scots. I suggested we be the Highland High School Royal Scots Volunteer Competitive Field Marching Band (HHSRSVCFMB), but it was too long. So, I have no clue. Other ideas were, The Bloody Scots, The Last of the Scotsmen, and Highland Gourd, really, Gourd. I have no bloody clue.

      First: Happy Mahvelous Fourth of July.  Second: It is 8:27 pm, and it is still long from dark.  Third: I am spending this great day with a load of people, most of whom, I do not know. Yes, I am spending it with Scott's family and friends. Yes, they originate mostly from Oildale.  Fourth: Oildale = 93308 (The '08) = Oh the Redneckyness. Yes. Rednecks. Insert a load of Jeff Foxworthy jokes. By the way, all of them are true.  Fifth: It is finally getting dark, so I must be brave and enter the world of the overpriced, short-lived fireworks, and once again, as I am slowly learning to love, the Rednecks...

      I appreciate John Kerry. I think he's great. I am watching the convention with my family. Campaign Promises. I don't care. I don't like Jorge Dubya Bush.&nbsp; I think that John Edwards doesn't look 51. He is, however better looking than Kerry. That's nice. I understand that they have good hair. To be a President, is it necessary to look like a caricature of yourself? It's fun being a Democrat!

      Oh,&nbsp;doth I hear thoust dearest ship call my name? 5 days until we leave. This is a very exciting time ofr me. I am wearing new shoes.&nbsp; My mother and I went shopping yesterday and I bought 3 pairs of shoes, one bag, a polo shirt, and hoodie and earplugs. All things essential to my happiness in 5 days.   Now, I will take the time to share with you my admiration of the dollar theatre. The dollar theatre is a great place to be. If you didn't catch a showing in the real theatre, wait a month and pay a buck fifty to see that movie. If you go matinee it's only a dollar, and on Tuesdays, it's only 50 cents all day. I have seen 2&nbsp;movies there this summer; Starsky &amp; Hutch and 50 First Dates. For just a small sacrafice of theatre size and no dolby or DTX sound, you get what you want, before you rent it from Blockbuster. Alas, I was going to go there today but didn't because my dumb brother didn't want to. Grr Argh. Wait, I have a Drivers License, I can go by myself. Later Suckas!

      Oh, Woe is me...kinda. I like eBay, I really do, but I hate being out-bid! I am currently betting on a GameBoy Advance Game called "Jeopardy! Teen Tournament", and I have been out bid. Let me explain to you the reason I want this game. Long ago, I thought I could be smart enough to go on Jeopardy! and since I am a teen, the teen tournament was the obvious choice. So I signed up. And they contacted me 3 weeks ago to tell me that I have an appointment to go to L.A. and audition. Oy. I want to practice this whole jeopardy thing with the freaking game. But why? Why outbid me? It was a very obscure search of a hard-to-find game.  I WANT THE DARN GAME!!!! GRRRRR!  Obviously this angers me.   Yesterday, I decided that the previously much appraised Jamba Juice is over in my heart. I have over indulged and now it is worthless, and that makes me sad. : (

      It has been a few weeks since I have written in this thing, I have been, once again, prompted by my own conscience to write.&nbsp; My favorite writer for the  Bakersfield Californian &nbsp; has a blog on this website  urlLink www.daniellebelton.blogspot.com . I love her. I really do. She's a great writer with an apparent love of Prince. She is a very interesting writer. She has this column called WOTS ( W ord  O n  T he  S treet) and doesn't have her name on it as to leave the impression that it is anonymous. It's not, anyone who reads the  Eye Street  (the Californians entertainment section) will know it is her. Oy. I used to be an aspirering journalist. My dreams were dashed when, after one year of journalism my Sophomore year of HS,&nbsp; I chose Wind Ensemble over it. I was pretty good at it too. I was going to apply for an internship at the Californian but didn't. Anyway...   I have a new favorite place.&nbsp; Jamba Juice.&nbsp; Pretty much the best smoothies short of my own.&nbsp; I have been drinking them a lot lately. I think that the best flavor is&nbsp; "Strawberry Tsunami". Yummy! I think everyone should experience Jamba Juice. There has never been a better way to consume calories.

      Ah, Today is the day. My Mom and I leave for the Port of Los Angeles at around 9. There was a fatal accident on the 5 southbound this morning, but I'm pretty sure the freeway is open again. If it isn't then we are really screwed. Anyway, I'll probably post on or around the 6th, or maybe even on the boat. 25 cents a minute though, oh well. Later..... Mwahahahaha... I hope the boat doesn't sink......

      Today was me day of undiluded understanding. I figured a few things out. First: I miss my friends. Second: I don't need them and anyone who truly needs thier friends for everyday life is not comfortable enough with themselves. Third: Nohting makes me fell betten than driving 8o miles per hour listening to the Police and Pink Floyd. I went to Borders, Books, and Music today and after an hour of bumming around and finally gotten to reading a Sex and the City book, 4 girls walked in. And I knew all of them. These are the girls created by Abercrombie and Fitch and the inevitable "Roxy". Never really friends, although I used to hang with their crowd. Anyway, I kinda halk-freaked out and crawled into my shell. I don;t know why and it took about 10 minutes of my convincing myself that these girls, who, yes, all know me by name, don't give a rats soft behind about that girl named Allyson Hoolder hiding behind her short hair and Vanity Fair. Excepting the fact that my naturally red hair is unusually bright, I think they saw me. Is it possible that they were intimidated? No. Scared? No. Didn't want to talk to me? YES!! Ding-ding-ding.  Oh God, what have I done. I am practically a walking contradiction. I really don't know why. Also, I think I might be either the oldest or youngest 16-year-old on the planet. I am destined to be forever alone? I seem to have gotton this far. God, I am so confused...
