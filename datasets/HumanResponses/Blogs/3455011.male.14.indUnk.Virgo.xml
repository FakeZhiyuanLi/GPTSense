      ok now about jib. jib is a flying sheep that i found in my friends refrigerator.well one day he just would not shut up. so me and him got in an arguement. once i lost i got mad grabbed a sword and tried stabbing him. ever since then he never said another word. once in a very long while he will speak up but not to often. so thats basically the story of jib. if he ever comes and tries to live in your fridge and he makes a really odd sound just grab a sword and stab the inside of your ice box maker

       okay hera are a few answers to many questions you may have about steel. . .  yes steel is his real nname and yes he was dropped as a baby. other than that he is not completely normal. for anyone who is interested go to www.aerissprayer.blogspot.com its nicoles website. for stell i found out how to post pics.  zann e-amiled this to me so it should help if you have any questions ask zann @ www.inzannity.blogspot.com "hey redwood,  if you want to post pictures, you have to have a place to store them (there's no place to put them on blogger right now).  then you have to link to the picture when you write your blog entry or edit your template (i can show you how to do that later on if you want).  as for finding a place to store your pictures on the web, try photobucket.com.  i noticed you first emailed from an aol name... aol gives you free web space too (keyword: myspace, i think).  i used to use that before i got my own domain.  g'luck! *zann" how come you dont e0-mail me any more did you forget my adress? Rdwd02@aol.com or voodooman02@yahoo.com
