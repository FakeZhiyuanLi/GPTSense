      Ok, it's official..I'm startin to freak. I haven't been able to get in touch with Joe for 2 days now. Every flippin' time I try and call him, the stupid-ass Sprint operator comes on the line and says his "PCS number is currently unavailable..message blah blah blah blah." Why does this always happen to me? He pisses me off and then after I calm down and want to see what his problem is, I can never get ahold of him. Either its the biggest fuckin' sign on the face of the earth or he's avoiding me. But honestly, I haven't the faintest idea as to why he'd avoid me. After being so close for 4/5 years, we know eachother inside and out. Even after we broke up, we still talked, hung out...whatever. I still haven't exactly figured out why he still calls me though, despite the fact he has a girlfriend. I dont' even think he could ( or would for that matter ) explain that one. It's just become second nature- when you get home, you call him. When you get a free moment, you call him. And the same for him. Fuck, man...he frickin called me just to say "HI" before he went to bed on Friday night. I was away at the Cabin the entire weekend so i couldn't call him back. Maybe it's just because we're such good friends, but I can't help but think about him, ya know? Ya know what Mom said to me about him once? "Ya know, Madeline. Ya'll could be a 'When-Harry-met-Sally" kinda deal!" After she said that, I couldn't help but get goosebumps. I know its one of those deals where it's a chance of slim-to-none, but it's kinda fun to think about. Being with your best friend for the rest of your life..ya know? But whatever. I hope to God he didn't pay the phone bill in time or he broke his phone or something. Because I won't know what I'd do if something happened to him. It was hard enough having him move away. I've lost enough of my friends/family lately; no need to add insult to injury. Pray for me...and his stupid fuckin phone for that matter.

      Well, I'm the last one left. All my friends, of those who are moving away, have left. Minus Amanda, I am the remaining member of our group. Heather, Rache, Trace, Mammy, Jess, Belen, Kit, Mike..Man, I could go on forever- they're all gone. I'll go through phases of being incredibly sad and then all of a sudden I'm siked about leaving. I helped Trace and Amanda move down to Radford this Friday. We got down to the campus and it was CRAWLING with people. I'm talking about not being able to walk 25 feet without bumping into some ass with an arm full of clothes or boxes. Tracy's room is on the 7th floor of Muse,a 13-floor dorm. Amanda got lucky and got onto the 1st floor of Draper. Lucky me- I got to spend my Friday walking across campus and up and down a fuckin billion flights of steps. With all the complaints I can muster, I can honestly say it was a good time. Their cousin Ashley is going to school there too. At the end of the night we all went out to dinner together. Had a great time joking around, being loud as hell like we are when we're with eachother. When you get four/five eighteen year-old girls together, you're guaranteed to hear the cackling and screaming all the way across the street. After all the steps and cross-campus treks, I have the strongest wrists in the world..and not to mention great looking quads now ;)
