        This is really just a test blog to make sure everything is working O.K. This blog is currently about all my interests in general -- so posts here from me will probably be varied widely in topic and scope. Later on though, I may find myself publishing a lot of blogs on a certain topic, in which case I'll specialize in blogging about only that subject -- we'll see what happens. Anyway, I hope I can make this an interesting place to visit, and if you ever come here and have suggestions, or any other type of comment you'd like to leave, please feel free too.

        "...America these days is like death. Nobody can escape from it."  â€” Qassim al-Sabti, an artist living in Baghdad"     When I woke up this morning and checked my e-mail, I immediately saw the front page headline -- Iraq was receiving its sovereignty two days before the projected June 30th date. For much of the day, I read enthusiastic, propaganda-like reports on how "the Iraqi people have their country back." (President Bush), and how the Coalition that has occupied/invaded Iraq for 467 days been 'disbanded.' Iraq would be a complete democracy by 2005. They would have control over their security forces. People were celebrating.  Then, however, I saw the quote printed at the top of this blog on Yahoo! News. It seemed al-Sabti, the artist, didn't think the power handover meant anything. And it doesn't. Though the Coalition won't exist anymore, and its head Paul Bremer will be removed from that postion, foreign military forces -- of which the U.S. has 138,000 -- will continue to provide security and be in the country. al-Sabti still felt occupied, and as an Iraqi civilian, he is probably the most qualified to determine if his country is being occupied or not. Since the interim government that will operate for the next seven months is obviously in the United State's pocket, what's the point of even having a big show about power transfer.  That's right. There isn't a point. This is just another attempt by the American government and the Bush administration that controls it to gain popularity in the U.S. by election time, and to keep the Iraqis and the rest of the Middle East calm. As long as the Iraqis think they are getting a good deal, they won't fight back and protest. But since the Iraqis are smarter than that, they feel they're being cheated, and just hours after the transfer ceremonies, insurgents struck in Baghdad and other areas in Iraq. Violence is now expected to increase to fight the new 'Iraqi' government. All that will result from this big show is more bloodshed. And who knows how long it will be until Iraq really gets back its self control? My friend pointed out a comic strip in which a U.S. soldier laughed when an Iraqi government official told him he now had power. 'You know how many permanent military bases the U.S. is building here.' the soldier responded. Under the cruel hands of modern-day America and the Bush administration, Iraq may  never  get its self-rule back. Everything the U.S. has ever done in Iraq since Day 1 just goes to show how true al-Sabti's quote really is.
