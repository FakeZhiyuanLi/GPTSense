      [TIP 1.] Just a little post to recomend the use of the exectutive lounges at the airport!! They have 6 different colous of tea bags at least and many varieties of biscuits! Yay!! they have several mini-bars and more and it's all free!! yay!  [TIP 2.] Don't forget to take all things given to you by the hotel 'with their compliments' as you are probably aying for them some other way even if you dont take them! Take things like tea bags, chocolate sashees, jam etc. on a daily basis as they will be replenished but otherwise jst get what you can when ou can!  [TIP 3.] Remember to smile and greet all the nice folks u meet, even if they're mean and nasty lookin, an nice smile and a polite "mornin!" never go a miss :-D

      Tomorrow, my friend, is the day, I'm telling u it is, its the day u will eat a frog. frogs may be cute and cuddly, but believe me, if u don't eat one tomorrow it will eat u!! Beware, I fear for your life. Sniff. Please, please eat a frog tomorrow. It doesn't have 2 be a big one, u can cover it in batter if u like, but not while its still alive, kill it first, otherwise it will eat u from the inside out...  have fun!!
