       For the first time in 2 years my weight went DOWN!  1.5 pounds and I feel great about it if not a bit skeptical - was it a fluK?  an error in the scale?  time of day?  time of month?  Anyway, I'm back on track after a little heavy partying and ready to see if it will happen again!  Wish me luck!

       Mumbo & I have talked and we've decided that - to START - we will limit ourselves to the Serving Sizes recommended for store bot food.  For Example:  We bot some pretzles.  When have we ever limited ourselves to the suggested serving size of 5 pretzles?  Well, we're going to limit ourselves to that amount....  per day?  per x number of hours?  that remains to be decided.

       Way to go, Mumbo!!!  We had friends over for dinner last night and you only  had ONE glass of champagne and NOT the whole bottle of red wine.  Turned out  that neither I nor one of our guests drank any wine so that left it up to  you and the other guest.  The other guest only had one glass of the red wine  so normally you would have finished up the bottle on your own.  But you left  1/3 of a bottle.  Way to go!!!  Great portion control.

       Everybody - including us - knows that losing weight comes down to two things: 1) What you eat    a) Composition of diet (fats, proteins, carbs, veggies, fruits)    b) Portion control 2) Exercise    a) stimulates metabolism    b) additional muscle mass burns more calories.  So we're doing a pretty good job with #2 - we could do more in the way of aerobic excercise.  It's #1 - that's our big challenge and I think it really has everything to do with PORTION CONTROL.  Can we think of some ways that we can implement some kind of portion control system?

       I must say that it is with much excitement that I write this.  For the first time - in I can't remember how long - I believe this get healthy thing is going to work for me!  Why? you might ask.  One word... Jumbo!  Having a partner to go through this with has made all of the difference in my quest for health.    Jumbo has always loved my body and has never been "against" my attempts to get healthier, but having her as a co-leader in our journey is defferent.  I am encouraged by her health efforts and she notices mine.  Together we are a VERY powerful team and what better thing to team up on than getting healthier.   Thank you Jumbo-itsy, I love you!

       This morning, Mumbo and I were talking.  It all started with me saying that The Universe / God / The Great One keeps WHACKING me for ignoring red flags that I experience.  I should set up a blog for this.... maybe later.  Anyway, one thing led to another and soon we were talking AGAIN about how we need to lose weight.  Jumbo has lost significant weight 3x before - 2x using Nutrisystem and 1x using Jenny Craig.  Right now I am 5' 9" tall and weigh 209 lbs. I am comfortable in a size 16 because I think I lost a pound or two on my recent travels.  I have clothes in the following sizes: 8 - 10 - 12 - 14 - 16.  I work out at the gym so I do have a fair amount of muscle mass.  My doctor says another contributing factor to my weight is that I am "big boned."  So we decided that we have to lose weight and that since we love all kinds of food we can't do Atkins.  NutriSystem and Jenny Craig are too expensive.... plus we don't want to eat that nasty food.  But most importantly we think we have to figure out this in a way that we'll be able to maintain forever.  So we set up this blog so that we can document our thoughts, successes, failures.  We know this is a huge issue for people everywhere so we welcome your input.

      Today I am grateful for:&nbsp; My children, my spouse, the beautiful weather, that I made it to Sherman Oaks and back without too much traffic or without an accident or any problem whatsoever, my Black Lab, a clean carpet, music, music, my shredder, my computer, the helpfulness of the guy I met with in Sherman Oaks, hearing from my kids &amp; talking to them on the phone, Cup-A-Soups, Diet Coke, gas in my car. No particular order.

      Today I am grateful for my wife, my children, my dogs, my wireless network, my business partner, my new business, the great weather we have here, the green grass, the way the branches of trees move in the breeze - that there can only be ONE infinity.
