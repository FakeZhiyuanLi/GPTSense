        BIOGRAPHY:         Born during the late '60s, Georgia native Julia Roberts was raised in a fervently pro-theater environment. Her parents regularly hosted acting and writing workshops, and both of the Roberts children (Julia and her brother Eric) showed an interest in the performing arts at an early age. Ironically enough, Eric was the first to break into film; in 1978, one year after their father died of lung cancer at 47,   urlLink  Eric Roberts    starred in director   urlLink  Frank Pierson   's psychological drama   urlLink  King of the Gypsies   . Though her older brother would go on to have a solid acting career, it was, of course, Julia Roberts who earned a spot among Hollywood's elite.   urlLink    After making her film debut in   urlLink  Blood Red    -- which wouldn't be released until 1989, despite having been completed in 1986 -- and appearing in several late '80s television features, Roberts got her first real break in the 1988 made-for-cable drama   urlLink  Satisfaction   . That role, consequently, led to her first significant supporting role -- a feisty pizza parlor waitress in 1989's   urlLink  Mystic Pizza    with   urlLink  Annabeth Gish   ,   urlLink  Lili Taylor   , and a then 19-year-old   urlLink  Matt Damon   . While   urlLink  Mystic Pizza    was not a star-making film for Roberts, it certainly helped earn her the credentials she needed to land the part of Shelby, an ill-fated would-be mother in   urlLink  Steel Magnolias   . The 1989 tearjerker found her acting alongside   urlLink  Sally Field    and   urlLink  Shirley MacLaine   , and culminated in an Oscar nomination for Roberts. While the success of   urlLink  Steel Magnolias    played no small part in launching Roberts' career, and undoubtedly secured her role in the mediocre   urlLink  Flatliners    (1990) with former flame   urlLink  Kiefer Sutherland   , it was director   urlLink  Garry Marshall   's romantic comedy   urlLink  Pretty Woman    with   urlLink  Richard Gere    that served as her true breakthrough role. Roberts' part in   urlLink  Pretty Woman    (a good-hearted prostitute who falls in love with a millionaire client) made the young actress a household name and cemented what would become a permanent spot in tabloid fodder. Roberts broke off her engagement with Sutherland in 1991, just three days before they were scheduled to be married, and surprised the American public in 1993, when she began her two-year marriage to country singer   urlLink  Lyle Lovett   . Roberts' personal life kept her name in the spotlight despite a host of uneven performances throughout the early '90s (neither 1991's   urlLink  Dying Young    or   urlLink  Sleeping With the Enemy    garnered much acclaim), as did a reputed feud with   urlLink  Steven Spielberg    during the filming of   urlLink  Hook    (1991). Luckily, Roberts made decidedly less embarrassing headlines in 1993, when her role alongside future Oscar winner   urlLink  Denzel Washington    in   urlLink  The Pelican Brief    reaffirmed her status as a dramatic actress. Her career, however, took a turn back to the mediocre throughout the following year; both Prêt-à-Porter and   urlLink  I Love Trouble    proved commercial flops, and   urlLink  Mary Reilly    (1996) fizzled at the box office as well. The downward spiral reversed directions once again with 1996's   urlLink  Michael Collins    and   urlLink  Conspiracy Theory    with   urlLink  Mel Gibson   , and led to several successful comic roles including   urlLink  Notting Hill    with   urlLink  Hugh Grant   ,   urlLink  Runaway Bride   , and most notably,   urlLink  My Best Friend's Wedding    with   urlLink  Rupert Everett    and a then virtually unknown   urlLink  Cameron Diaz   . Roberts' biggest success didn't present itself until 2000, though, when she delivered an Oscar-winning performance playing the title role in   urlLink  Steven Soderbergh   's   urlLink  Erin Brockovich   . The film, based on the true story of   urlLink  Erin Brockovich   , a single mother who, against all odds, won a heated battle against corporate environmental offenders, earned Roberts a staggering 20-million-dollar salary. Officially the highest paid actress in Hollywood, Roberts went on to star in 2001's   urlLink  America's Sweethearts    with   urlLink  Billy Crystal   ,   urlLink  Catherine Zeta-Jones   , and   urlLink  John Cusack   , as well as   urlLink  The Mexican    with   urlLink  Brad Pitt   . While on the set of   urlLink  The Mexican   , Roberts met cameraman Danny Moder, whom she would marry in 2001 almost immediately after ending a four-year relationship with fellow actor   urlLink  Benjamin Bratt   . Indeed, 2001 was a banner year for Roberts; in addition to   urlLink  America's Sweethearts    and   urlLink  The Mexican   , Roberts starred in the crime caper   urlLink  Ocean's Eleven   , in which she rejoined former co-stars   urlLink  Brad Pitt    and   urlLink  Matt Damon   , and acted for the first time with   urlLink  George Clooney    and   urlLink  Don Cheadle   . Julia Roberts worked with Soderbergh once again in 2002's   urlLink  Full Frontal   , which, despite a solid cast including   urlLink  Mary McCormack    and   urlLink  Catherine Keener   , among others, did not even begin to fare as well as   urlLink  Erin Brockovich   .   urlLink  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind    (2002), which featured Roberts as a femme fatale alongside   urlLink  George Clooney   ,   urlLink  Sam Rockwell   , and   urlLink  Drew Barrymore    did much better, and preceded 2003's   urlLink  Mona Lisa Smile    with young Hollywood's   urlLink  Julia Stiles   ,   urlLink  Kirsten Dunst   , and   urlLink  Maggie Gyllenhaal   . In 2004, Roberts is slated to film the sequel to   urlLink  Ocean's Eleven    -- the aptly titled   urlLink  Ocean's Twelve    .
