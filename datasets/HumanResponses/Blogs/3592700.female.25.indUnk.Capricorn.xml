      so i'm working through my little list of things to do for life in general and college registration. and one of those things is to take assessment tests. the college website offers sample tests to help you fine-tune your brain.  i totally ruled the reading test. like, 100%.  i totally ruled the writing test. like 100%.  i have yet to get an answer right on the math test. i have done all 14 questions at least 5 times each, with no correct answers. it's a basic algebra test!! i have spent almost 3 hours on several algebra tutorial websites, and none of the sample questions they offer have anything like the equations used in the test.  a little background : high school was spent in 4 or 5 different christian schools, including one year homeschooling. none of the teachers there were qualified to teach algebra, so i took consumer math 3 times. the year i homeschooled i took algebra 1. that year was largely self-taught, since my mom was too depressed to be much of a parent. i tried really really hard and spent about 6 hours a day on each lesson trying to understand it and eventually my hard work paid off : i got a 99 on the course. WITH all work shown! i possess an above-average intelligence, and i do really well in math once i grasp it. but i need help to get there.  crud :( i have to try to re-learn everything i purposefully forgot, in the next 14 hours or so. i can see myself in the remedial math class already.

      i have realized that i will never sleep through the night again. i don't even have little kids. i have a 14 year old stepson who sleeps like the dead. i have two dogs and a cat. if i were forced to choose which pet i loved most, it would be the cat. but not last night. last night i would have cheerfully shipped her to rwanda.  every 90 minutes, she crept up next to my face and then patted it lightly, gently, then insistently and with claws. i know she had food and water. i know her litterbox got changed. i played with her vigorously half an hour before bedtime. so WHY fucking WHY did she have to wake me up!!? at the beginning of the night, i would pick her up and drop her off the edge of the bed. towards 4 am, i threw manners to the wind and pushed her off.  after that she left me alone.  ten minutes later i heard a groan from downstairs, followed by quiet whining that promised to become loud howling, quickly.  the fucking dog had to pee. or whatever.  i let them out, decided i wasn't going to wait for them to finish up, and stomped back up to bed. my husband could let them in when he got up.  so this is why i am unable to summon up the energy to Do Things Today.  the coffee widgetry that glistens everywhere in my kitchen has been fully employed.   my husband and stepson are in BFE at a car show for at least 10 more hours.  and all i've done the past two hours is read blogs and webcomics and news and rub my eyes and jaw-creakingly yawn.  i should be out on a long walk with the fat dog. i should be grouting the tile. i should be cleaning up the dessert dishes from dinner last night. i should be plucking my eyebrows. i should be looking for a job. i should be looking for a studen loan.  but i haven't read penny arcade in a week. so fuck the shoulds.

      ...for going to the grocery store in sweatpants. not matching-set soccer-mom sweatpants. my husband's old, cast-off 80s-style with muddy pawprints and dog fur all over them sweatpants. it's like i never left alaska.  when i was a kid, we'd go to the grocery store and there would be massively unkempt women everywhere in old sweatpants and flannel shirts. the sweatpants would invariably be tucked into a pair of sorel boots, and a faint odor of dog and/or b.o. would follow in their wake. i always vowed to never go out in public in sweatpants.  what have i become?

      i slept too long, and as a result, am craving coffee. so i'm drinking this overbrewed sludgy stuff my husband's friend made last night because i'm too lazy to clean out the coffeemaker and make a fresh batch. yech. but mmm.  it's been raining off and on for the past two days, with spectacular thunderstorms and flooding in parts of town. i felt that was my cue to send out a massive "fuck you" to low-carb diets by making potato chowder. so good. i even toasted chunks of sour rye and floated them on top of each bowl.   i better go clean up. i moved the dogs' kennel and they're still getting used to it. i have to use the Loud Mommy Voice and grab collars. with all the rain, they're muddy and after three cleanups, i gave up and left them in the kennel. little mud chunks everywhere.  we're having 5 people over for dinner tonight. bleh.

       ....i do that annoy my husband :    &nbsp;  1.buy store brand stuff instead of commercial brand stuff ("it tastes wrong!")   2.leave the hose on the grass after watering it   3.communicate non-intelligently and be a bitch in general when the pms monster is around   4.worry. and be anxious   5.read in bed and keep him awake, because he has a hard enough time sleeping as it is    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ....he does that annoy me :    &nbsp;  1.leave his stuff in a central location and forget about it for 3 months, 2 weeks, and a day, and then need it urgently, suddenly RIGHT NOW and griping that i "put shit where he can't find it". because the middle of the driveway is the best storage place for those dvds he borrowed   2.see #1   3.snore when i already can't sleep (but most of the time it's cute)   4.not cleaning up after himself   5.use 17 cups of oil to deep-fry&nbsp;1 sliced-up potato, thus ensuring that everything from here to colorado springs is splattered with grease

      there should be an actual time called ass o'clock. it should refer to everything before 6 am, and after 1 am. i've become soft and weak. i used to get up at 3:30 every day for work after going to bed at 11. these days, being hauled out of bed at 6:15 by my husband's ex calling is excruciating. god forbid i ever get less than 8 hours of sleep.

      i'm not talking about music records.  i'm talking about my math test score. 45 out of 120 is enough to keep the classes i'm registered for, and lets me into a remedial course, which i really wanted to take. if i never really had a chance to learn it right in the first place, why not do it now?  oh joy! oh bliss! everything is going to be ok, school-wise.  and now, pig-dog!   urlLink    this dog!

      holy fucking shit. i just googled mariana trench and hit the little shamrock. and what do i find? what seems to be a cool easy-science website CRAWLING WITH SPYWARE POPUPS!! a popup jumps out for that goddamn "set your homepage to searchwebgoto.com? click yes to continue" and alt+f4 doesn't get me out of it. moral of the story : get your underwater jollies elsewhere. that website is whack.  i call these lows "the trench" in reference to the mariana trench. everything is dark and i feel a lot of pressure. when i was a kid and thought about my mom being depressed, i assumed she felt mellow and relaxed all the time because she slept so much. now that i'm depressed, i realize that's not the case. i feel like a hamster on an endless wheel run. my thoughts race around and around and seem to get darker and darker with each squeak.   i can't do anything. i can't focus on anything or even remember names for things. my emotions are helter-skelter. eventually i get worn out from trying so hard and i have to sleep. i think there's probably a lot of anxiety mixed in with this particular bout due to school starting and my lack of employment.  in short, i feel like shit and two days ago i felt giddy, exuberant, on top of the world. highs and lows.  i'm doing everything i'm supposed to. eventually i will feel better. i am really thankful to my husband for sticking with me and being such a great support.  i'm reading an old book by greg bear about these living cities and the people who lived in them. it's kind of post-apocalyptic. it's not really a great book...i can tell he was still refining his style and learning to develop more cohesive plots. but this is what i love about greg bear : he always has a fresh twist, something new to think about, something i never thought of before.  i got up at 5:30 this morning to drive 35 miles to an interview. i arrived and they asked me what i was looking for. i said, part-time, preferrably an administrative support position. one of them got this funny look on his face and said, you're not here for the marketing director position? no, i replied, i thought this was an office clerk job. he cleared his throat and read through my resume quickly. well, it's too bad. it looks like you'd be perfect for the job.   i'd like to state that i am not, nor will i ever be a marketing director. nothing on my resume says this. not even close. asshattery! rampant asshattery!!

      my betta died. he wasn't eating the past two days...i tried to feed him about 6 hours ago and he didn't have much interest.  he was a beautiful electric blue.  he used to make me enjoy getting up in the morning. i'd stumble into the kitchen to start the coffee and he would swim wildly around the bowl. after a while, he did it when my husband came in the kitchen too. my husband thought he wanted to be fed, but he would do it after feeding too. happy to see us, i guess.  just your regular 70's hong kong action star siamese fighting fish.  he used to terrorise the guest betta that lived with us for a bit. i'd put their tanks next to each other and he'd get all puffy and change colors. the other fish would try to hide in the gravel. it always made me laugh.  my husband wants to get another one and call him sonny chiba. i don't know if i'm ready yet.

      today we went to the bug-in show at bandimere speedway. it was a lot of fun....i want a karmann ghia now. a convertible. and of course i would paint it pink. with flames. and get one of those custom jobs stating "carmen's ghia" on the back. but no pink fuzzy dice. i hate shit hanging from my rear-view mirror.  i told my husband this and i thought his eyes would pop out in shock that i actually wanted an old vw. he's going to try to find me one for about $500 and we can restore it together.  we watched the time trials for a while. one guy's muffler fell off. they sent this big dude on a little scooter up the track to get it. i, not having had coffee this morning, thought he was competing for a time trial. a porsche was revving up in the lane next to him and i thought that was just really unfair.  there were a lot of old vw busses there...i saw one all fixed up and tricked out for sale - $49,000.00. jesus fuck.  when we arrived, my husband's friend thought perhaps they charged entrance fee per car, so we (five of us) piled into the '62 bug he was showing. and of course, they charged per person. truly, i haven't seen my knees that close-up since the last time i shaved my legs. however, i'm just glad it had a back seat. my husband's '63 doesn't.  i'm grilling eggplant for lunch and it smells almost done.

      i'm tired. exhausted, even. i keep having to remind myself to close my mouth as i type.  it was one of those gone-from-the-house-for-12-hours weekend days. i have spent so much time at home the past year that i feel off if i'm gone for too long. i start missing the dogs and the cat.  we bought school clothes for my stepson today. he has to wear uniforms this year for his new school. we had a serious difference of opinion about pants. i hate, hate,   loathe pleated dress pants with tapered legs. i hated them when they were in style (ten years ago) and i hate them now. they are an incredibly unflattering style on anyone. why couldn't he wear (more fashionable) flat-front, boot-cut dress pants? oh no! those are "gangster pants". the poor kid is going to look like a dork. he's small for his age, starting high school at a new school where he doesn't know anyone, and already a bit otaku, so he needs all the help he can get. at least we got him some cool shoes.  on further reflection, it occurred to me that we never really asked him what he wanted. however, there were only two options for uniform clothes, and my husband made it abundantly clear the "gangster pants" weren't an option. poor kid, stuck shopping for clothes he doesn't want with two parents who can't make a decision without bickering over it.  we went up to my in-laws' house to bask in their air-conditioning, and played poker.   i won $2.50.  and promptly spent in all in one place : dq, on a brownie batter blizzard. (the "much thafer" one)  is it wrong that i laughed my ass off at that poor guy in the commercial? and promptly tried to imitate the sound of his screams while his tongue was being eaten by the blender? i can't find a download of it and i'm too tired to look really hard.  i am a cwuel bathtawd.

      intermission.  it's been a hard week.  some weeks are harder than others.  i keep thinking about last year around this time. maybe if i hadn't smoked that pack of cigarettes about that time, it wouldn't have happened.  i will never smoke again. anything.  all those years i didn't smoke, and stayed "quit".  why did i pick that particular two weeks to start again?  it hasn't even been a year yet. please don't expect me to be "over this". please don't expect me to "stop being morbid." please don't tell me "work this out with your therapist so you stop thinking about it."   i will probably think about this every day for the rest of my life.  we return to your regularly scheduled program now.

      so it's like 97 degrees here.  we went up to the mountains for 5 hours or so to escape. coming back down I-70 was like sitting in an oven as it heats up.  but, i saw burros near buena vista. the cuteness! the cuddliness! unfortunately, we didn't stop since the dogs were with us.  i might post a picture or two tomorrow if any came out good. i'm starting to dislike my digital camera. it's damn difficult to get clear pictures on it. it's like an old-fashioned daguerrotype! the subject has to hold still forever.  however, in about 4 weeks, things will start to cool off, and then it will be my favorite time of year. i love fall.
