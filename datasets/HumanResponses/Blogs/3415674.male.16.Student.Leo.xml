      Such a rush/ believe your deceit Concrete/ only when you sleep More than/ all I ever need Too much/ seems to make me bleed Forfeit/ all I used to know For shit/ I'll only have to show Believe/ that all will be alright But decieve/ I won't be home tonight  Show me how to fight this So I won't live a lie Give me some incentive so at least I can try

      When your arms cry in crimson tears They’re telling you don’t succumb to your fears I’m telling you don’t succumb to your fears I’ll keep you safe, I’ll keep you alive I’ll burden your pain upon myself So yout soul may rise Fears retract, soar to the skies And I like pie  [Why haven't I fixed this yet?]

      Thrown off the spaceship to your universe Mabye I'll make it next time Feels as though I have a disease Thinking I can do the impossible in my mind Cause I know you're there And I think you're waiting For me to call This love isn't fading Will I sink, or will I surface To your island This makes me nervous I think I've found the words to tell you how I feel  I think of you so much, even in my sleep Sometimes it lifts me up and keeps me on my feet I'll make a move this time Something I should have done years ago So can we be together? Let us glow and grow Will I sink, or will I surface To your island You make me nervous I think I've found the words to make my dreams real

      When your love is so Contagious... I think I should up and go Cause all roses have their thorns. And you'll just drag me down below I know your something more But your not something for me And you never say What you see in me  SO JUST... LEAVE So I may fight this on my own SO JUST... LEAVE So I can have a chance to grow SO JUST... LEAVE ME HERE  It felt so good today Free and on my own So much that my outlook changed Even my voice had a higher tone Love is something that I will stay out of For as long as I possibly can Cause love is the weakness I can't stand

      There's more to this somewhere but this is all I remember by heart, I'll finish it when I find the paper I wrote it on.  Everything is grey The world is out of place  I turn to her and She turns away her face I’d like to think were on the mend But I know its just pretend I can’t fix a broken heart The glass was shattered from the start Now everything I see Is covered in kerosene I’ll watch the match fall Cause soon I wont care at all.

      [I wrote most of this a few months ago on the bus to school and to home, I just put in a quick chorus and finished parts of the second and first stanzas, this isn't about anyone in particular, its a story of a girl who gets too caught up in trends and whats popular, spoken from the point of view of someone who was a good friend that they left behind for something "better"]  To me you were godsent To others you were trash A firelfy caught in the rain  No one thought you would last Light and wings dampened (by our culture) But I’ll heal them anew Cause you’re the only one I trusted Something I’ve now learned to never do Because your eyes gleam so bright alone As you turn your ears to the radio Everywhere distance is growing Inch by inch it kills us all But I’d rather jump of the cliff now For I have created another cause of the fall.  Societies Girl Beautiful but phoney Always sweet talks Cause she’ll die if she gets lonely If she would open her eyes and look around She’d realize That the spotlight wasn’t plugged in at all  Now that you’ve moved up so high Is it hard to look down to where you came? Cause you know the clouds aren’t thick enough To forget who your friends are in this game I believe that you could come back to your senses And take off those worn out headphones Because the music is so repetitious And everyone is calling you to come back home

      You worship the ground you can't walk on even though the grass is greener where you stand I'll show you a place you never knew and I will forever be your man  Its taking time but surely its close to the time when we will break our molds ticking clocks make us all but sane dropping down to crack cocaine  always seen in the stars gaze  the love we gave untill the grave cant explain anything anymore

      Seize the day look away from your pessimistic circles now freeform, painting colours non-existent to the monotone scale appreciate a summers day because life is filled with uncertainty and death will always be calling but do your best to make him leave a message while you listen to the music in the living room.

      Hidden behind white walls with no exits. Nothing is heard outside of this box. I've sealed myself away again. Where everything I do is lost.  A light illuminates, the direction unknown. Somewhere outside someone is calling. Light appears at a new window. Suddenly my voice changes its tone.  Walls start to shatter as I call the name. It calls back in a tone that kept the gods sane The walls dissapear and nothing else matters I see the one standing there...

      It burns in my lungs Out to my tounge What has to be let out This dream is done  Don’t know how it fell apart this way Or how it came to this  It felt like I was just playing a part today And love was only in the scripts  I’d like to believe That you would stay with me But I’ve started to see That you’ve left the scene  I’d thought it last But that was one big laugh Too bad its over now And all the fun we had So goodbye and so long It was nice to get to know you Don’t know what went wrong ______________________??????  I’d like to believe That you would stay with me But I’ve started to see That you’ve left the scene

      I wrote this one night to try this method of just writing and not thinking about it... It may seem odd but it works.  Somewhere I wanted to belong but time has passed and now it all seems wrong  Inside of me  it wasnt hard to see how much I gave is what I could not give now I'll have to fill the void before I can live  Never thought it'd come to this Never thought I'd see the red lines on my wrists But then again its all repeat I fell to the ground but now I'll speak the words you don't wanna hear in a tone that you cannot bear  Crying out I start to shout whats locked up inside but spilling out.

      I wrote this awhile ago at the start of a time when I started to get depressed, then it got better, then it got even worse for a while, now I'm better but I like this for some reason.  Life just moves so fast  and I think I'm out of time.  The days are getting shorter  but longer in my mind.  I'll pin the blame on anyone  or anything but myself.  Mabye someday I'll realize  that I could use some help.  I could strategize the plot again  but I know it will fall apart.  More and more it seems so clear  that I should have never played a part.   Running away from my problems  is not what I should do.  And to throw myself back in...  the abuse would be too cruel.   My ambition is too much again.  So many thoughts are in my mind.  I'll take a chance on what seems so plain  but patterns of complications is only what I'll find.  I'll pin the blame on everything  when the causes are only mine.  For awhile I wont stage the plot  I'll be in the shadows on my own  and again I'll curse myself because I knew I should have known.

      This was written from the ideas I got from looking at the Spinx and having to use the line High above like a mountain, its not much but it works...   High above like a mountain you're the first thing the sun shines upon look at the ground then, to see all your reigning on but you've been there for too long everyone recognizes you your admirers have up and gone now your all but new now cracked and breaking everything eventually crumbles from all your lies and taking they will all move on

      [Verse] At the ripped off skin I look within inside of the soul filled up with sin cursed by my own method of words Work till the night comes out to hurt and how the moon shines all night alone with itself I don't wanna be cause this isolation is hell.  [Chorus] Look inside and see the part that is killing me I don't wanna be alone in my life  I'm not gonna die if the sun will always rise somewhere I can confide and I won't be alone.  In between lines are words revealed hiding a secret hate that mass appeals. victim to the production of mental concrete walls apathetic beings unevolved with thoughts unsolved. No more reason to stay for it neutral position is what you'll die in. Stay optimistic and in a minute you'll be laughin  [Chorus] I'm not gonna die if the sun will always rise somewhere I can confide and I won't be alone.  [Sub Verse] Open your mind... realize you'll never have to stand in line Open your mind... realize you'll never have to stand in line.  [Chorus] Look inside and see the part that is killing me I don't wanna be alone in my life  I'm not gonna die if the sun will always rise somewhere I can confide and I won't be alone.

      No Final Goodbyes  Thought I heard your echo in the crowd But I knew it could never be now that you're gone for good Its like your a million miles out of sight from where I stand But I know when I turn the final corner you'll be there holding my hand and with all we have rekindled it lauches a rocket though the skies to see the stars in a better view.  I'd give it up for one more day I'd give it up so you could stay I'd give up everything so we could be together.  Sometimes I think your here beside me  Watching me write everything I never told you Yeah the days get longer and they colder But it wont wear down on me as long as I think of being with you.  I'd give it up for one more day I'd give it up so you could stay I'd give up everything so we could be together.  I'd give it up for one more day I'd give it up so we could be together I'd give up everything so you could stay Because I couldent take that as our final goodbye.

      [I finally wrote something, and its part of an actual acoustic song I've made. I was having trouble writing things because I couldent really find a good subject, so I wrote about a relationship I was in this year and wrote about the better points of it and this is what came out, from the heart... It doesn't really hold any truth to how I feel, mabye a little but it doesn't matter now, I just used it to get something out on paper mostly, there was another small part but I took it out and I'm going to change it].   The moon glows so much With teardrops in my eyes So I’ll close them tight and imagine you’re here with me Everything felt so right  Do you remember last December? Walking in the cold and rain didn’t matter cause you were worth it Everyone was cheerful for the holidays And you were with me It was all I could ever ask for But you’ve passed just like the season has And all I have now are the gifts that seem so priceless Cause you’ve passed just like the season And now I wait for what seems so long  for you to come back around.   [This is the part I took out, needs changing though] The moon still glows brightly but it looks so alone untill it turns on its axis and sees what has been missing.  [and mabye some chorus lines would be good too.]

      Lately there has been a lack of me posting anything due to the fact that I have a writers block, I'm gonna try different ways to come up with stuff soon cause I know singing sometimes works or something faster like freestyle rapping (even though I really can't rap worth anything). I'll get on it soon I hope...

      Broken home, broken words Speak of truths, its so absurd Filtered lies, my eyes are blind Its all the same untill your mine So forget the rest, fuck the test Always play the game on the edge I’m not insane, cause you see my point I stand my ground, only to avoid. Face the fact that your angel of lead Wont give you the advantage here  Theres a point I’d like to prove But you just pull away From me...  Storm their homes, raid their lives The more you take the more you die Feel the rain crash down on your soul Now ask why as you lose control Reverse the tide, start to slide Reap the worst you Jeckyll & Hyde  You are the anti-christ You are the bullshit Don’t concern me with making profit I see, and I believe But you just nuture my disease

      Wish I would have called you Wish I would have done something Wish I could have shown you that That life is so much more Than bleeding into nothing Your picture still haunts me It tries to tell me that you're alright Mabye I should believe it, and follow you.

      Am I nothing to you anymore? Did all the feelings just pack up And leave me for better? I can see you breathing now I can see you bleeding out Or is it just me? Your echo, it still resides In(side) my head, it won't subside Would you just, look at me before I die?

      okay, I still have a damn writers block knotting itself more and more in my brain but I found some older stuff I wrote at school sometimes to pass boredom in science and socials when I had nothing to do when I actually did my work, so here it is.    (nameless)   Packing memories in suitcases And throwing them into the ocean Leaves me free to be opened and broken I say I wont let them get to me anymore But I know its too early I have the awnsers to their questions But I wont let them know the truth disconnected, for what I shouldent be   Numb   Everyday is colder, my body is growing numb I've never felt like this before It feels like nothing can be done I look at all the photographs Of summers that have passed and remember all the memories and all the times that we laughed but then the clouds came again and I wish that it would snow and I wish that you would be mine again but this game is growing old.   Gone   I see through you Like you see through me We play this game but we never leave All I know is that I can't control My soul inside/I'm letting go  Look away cause I'm not here Insignificant for many years The shell is strong The love is gone So I'll stay here like I always have but I wish I could reach out and destroy the past  Ink stains the hands as a reminder of the past toxic like the memories I wish I didn't have.
