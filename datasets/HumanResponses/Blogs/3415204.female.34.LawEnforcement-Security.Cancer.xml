      Kyle and I are the new owners of a '96 Grand Marquis.  The Torino just wasn't my color.  I like red better than puke yellow.  HA!  But the Torino got us around to where we needed to get to for the time we needed it.  Time to move on to bigger and better things.  Kind of humbles a person driving a car that is almost as old as you are.  Of course that was not my first old car.    I remember car shopping when I was 15 with my dad.  We went to Goff Motors to look around and the first (and only) car my dad saw was an Old '67 Galaxy 5oo.  I about died when he said he would co-sign for the Galaxy but not for the little ford ranger I wanted so bad.  So it was either ride the bus to school or drive the Galaxy.  I remember the first day I took it to school.  I was a little shy in telling people that I bought an old car.  But, to my surprise I ended up being the envy of all of my male friends.  They had plans for me to paint it cherry red.  The Galaxy was in good condition with a little rust on the bottom, white exterior and interior.  The cool thing about it was you could roll down the front and back window and slide in and out of the car without opening the door.  No middle frame!  It was the car to be in while cruisin' the big town of Kinsley.  I can't remember how many kids we fit in that thing, but I know we got up to about 10 or 11 once.   Ahhh the good old day's.  Cars will come and go but the memories of the Galaxy will forever be etched in my memory.  sniff sniff

      Tonya and I have decided that we will not be out done by the male gender.  As females we have to stay ahead of the times for these are our duties as Women.  So we have elected to join the "Blogging" game.  And yes it is true, we couldn't stand to see you guys having more fun than us.  I have to say Seth, you may have started us on a new trend that none of us thought we would be in.  Now look at us...I guess we should never say never.  Here's to you Seth!

      I attended my son's first baseball game of the season last night and met up with an old friend.  Her son is on the same team as Shamus and is now in the same school.  About 15 years ago we worked with each other at Walmart during our first year of college.  We went our different ways and met back up in Offerle about 7 years ago.  Her oldest son and Shamus went to the same school and was in the same grade at that time.  Shamus and I moved to Dodge about 5 1/2 years ago and tried to keep in touch with them but they had moved several times and we lost touch once again.  Shamus told me that his friend had now moved to Bucklin and was on his baseball team.  My friend and her family were all there.  They have had two other children since we last spoke.  (Ok, so this is a long story)  When I approached her to say hello I noticed she was feeding a little boy about the age of 2-3 years old who was in a wheel chair.  He didn't speak and did not react to me when I spoke to him.  I assumed this was a foster care child she taken in since she had once been a foster care provider.  She corrected me and said that this was their youngest child.  Apparently her little boy has an encephalic disorder since birth and they have moved to different states taking him to different children's hospitals.  I felt so bad for her.  I felt guilty for feeling bad for her because she is so cheerful and in good spirits and acts as though she is blessed with the opportunity to take care of this child.  I was amazed with her patience and dedication toward her family.  Her husband is just as loving and it brings tears to my eyes to think of all that they have had to go through.  I didn't ask to many questions as we were out in public, but she gave me her number and told me to give her a call and she would fill me in on the last 6 years.  In all honesty, I don't think that I could ever be as patient and as forgiving as she is towards a disorder that disables a child in such a way.  But it does make me count my blessings for what I have and makes me pray to be strong if I ever had to deal with a situation like theirs.
