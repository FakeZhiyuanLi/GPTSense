Ya they had some pretty cute stuff. then we went to eat at wendys, then we went to the movies. it was pretty fun; rhis  friend  and his friend went. lol and at first it was kinda boring cuz those guys were dumb then it was like 8:15 and we still had like 45 minutes till it started so we went into the putting edge thing (the glow in the dark putt putt)ya its pretty weird. so then we saw white castle. it was halarious. but i kept thinkin of jason like the who time so ya i was kinda depressed:( but man i miss him so much. i just cant help it! but then i came home and here i am. lol. but now i think im gonna check my email then go to bed. i dont know why im so tired lately but im wiped! bye! muah!

       gawd, times are hard right now. Just about as tough as they could possibly be. And if there was only one time i really needed jason, it would be now. I mean not only cuz of what happened lately but just because he was one of the people closed to me that i could actually talk to. and now thats not even an option. today, my dad came home was being stupid and usually i just call jason but i really couldnt. :( then my mom came home and they started to fight again. but now im sitting here with nothing to do? so i thought id blog again. But ya whats kinda makin me mad is that jason isnt even talkin to me and he keeps playin with this msn crap so everytime he signs on this box thing pops up and has a little broken heart thing . uhgg lol <>

      Tonight was the worst night of my entire life. OMG I hate my life it totally sucks so bad. And I messed it up even more. Jason and I had been arguing for a while now and things were getting rough and so frustrating. I've cried my eyes out, screamed my head off, sat here and thought about whats important and what's not. And maybe me and Jason weren't meant to be ya know maybe things just didn't work out the way I planned. And I'm so sad and upset right now. My face burns from crying and my nails are bitten down to the skin, I feel as if I just got pushed down and kicked in the stomach a thousand times. :( I feel like crap that's a good way to put it I guess. I mean I love Jason so much and we had all we needed. It was so awesome; I loved him, he loved me, we loved each other. He was my best friend. He is my best friend. And right now I regret breaking up with him, maybe it will help us both in the end? I hope....I pray!?  I mean I lost everything I cared about everything I loved. I gave up on what little we had left. I didn't know what to do. I was scared. I was lost. I was so confused. And the worst part of it is I don't think he even trusted me when I told him I loved him. I mean it truly hurt me....So bad...So deep. It feels like the world just stopped or life just ended. I mean it sounds stupid I just truly genuinely love him. But I'm gonna try sleeping again I doubt I can but I'm gonna try.
