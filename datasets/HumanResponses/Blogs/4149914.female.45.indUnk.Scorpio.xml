       My friends and I are planning a Tag Sale in September. We will be offering Vintage Cottage Style goods in a beautiful setting in the evening under the stars. We have been buying and stashing some great shabby finds for the sale. Our plan is to do these sales 4-5 x per year. Creating displays or settings with our "finds" is very important to our Sale Mission. Stay tuned for more "Tag Sale" details :)

       This morning I went to 3 estate sales looking for Vintage Goods. I am constantly searching for treasures! I have a mental list that keeps me focused. The first sale I arrived at was limited entry. They only let the first 20 people in due to the size of the house~you guessed it I was like number 30 and felt like valuable time would be wasted if I stood waiting to get in. There just happened to be another sale 2 blocks away, so I darted out of line and headed to the next one! It was a little creepy on the outside and almost as creepy on the inside~but I forged through to the backrooms and found some wonderful things! My eye caught the site of a lovely white on white coverlet-but geez-no price. I decided to hold on to it any way and check the price out. I found a beautiful Bavarian Rose Plate with soft yellow and pink flowers and a lovely soft gold rim-Then wedged beneath some other K-mart style plates I found a wonderful Early Brown and White Transferware Plate with great details~the price was ok also! Then I found a pretty plate with a vintage lady on the front with mint green trim. Before heading to the front to pay I also noticed 2 white vintage table cloths. The dealer quoted me a price of $15 for the white on white coverlet and that came home with me also! I then went back to the limited entry estate sale-and was glad that I did not stay in line~everything was way to high! Heading closer to home I stopped at an estate sale and found a china jar with the prettiest Roses on the front~the lid had a small hairline crack on the top~but again no price! I found a bag of great black and white photo's that had some funky 40's style pictures that I bought. I got the Rose Jar for $8 even with the crack in the lid because it was old and in pretty good shape, but mostly beautiful! So 2 out of the 3 sales were definitely worth my time!

       I love decorating with Vintage finds! Soft, romantic pastels with vanilla and sepia undertones add to what I call the "visual sigh" to a room. Walls are painted a cream color~I love Ralph Laurens Paint Color~Linen~for the back drop......Just add plump upholstered furniture, side table and maybe a cupboard all in lighter colors. Now, this is the fun part! Accessories or details are next~the key here is finding a color and using it to add interest. For instance, I love pinks and reds~so~anything with Roses is a must for my Vintage room. Rose plates and McCoy pottery are great elements for a cottage feel. I also like to layer the room~take an old door or pair of shutters and place against the wall then hang and old mirror with interesting chain details. Vintage picture frames in white or gold are a staple also. I never pass these up at a sale. Old black and white photo's are another love. The idea is to make your Vintage room simple and yours!
