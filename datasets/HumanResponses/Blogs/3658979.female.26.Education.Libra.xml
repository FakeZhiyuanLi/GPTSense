      Ever have that feeling you had when you were a kid?  You know--the feeling of freedom.  No bills to pay.  No job to get up for in the morning.  The biggest worry you had was if Mom was going to make that awful meatloaf again.  I had that today.  I bought a bike.  It sounds corny, I know.  My husband and I filled out this little survey that listed things we enjoyed to do.  Bike riding was one we both ranked high.  So we bought bikes.  I haven't ridden a bike in over 10 years, at least.  It's an amazing feeling.  I recommend a bike to everyone out there over 25.  It'll make you feel 10 again.  The wind was whipping through my hair.  I was pumping my legs as fast as I could.  I even did the whole "standing up to get more leverage" thing.  I was carefree.  I was free.

      Ladies and gentleman, for your auditory pleasure (ladies...add in the visual pleasure for you), I'd like to introduce to you MICHAEL BUBLE!  (For those of you who do not know how to pronounce French names, that's Booblay).  www.michaelbuble.com in case you'd like to check him out.    I just got back from an amazing concert.  This young man is so very talented.  I cannot find the right words to say.  What other 28 year old singer can entertain 1,000 concert-goers who range from the ages of 15 to 85???  His voice is so smooth and rich, and he's SO very sexy I could barely contain myself.  He is being called the new Frank Sinatra, and rightfully so.  But, not only did he sing wonderful songs made famous by Blue Eyes, Bobby Darin (spelling??) and Van Morrison, he also entertained us with paradies of white rappers, Michael Jackson, and George Michael.  He was hilarious, yet classy.  Does that make sense?  Let's just put it this way.  It may be blunt, but it's true.  Michael Buble is getting men across the world laid.  It's true.  Men, go out and buy yourselves one of his CDs.  It'll be the best $14.99 you've ever spent.  Consider it an investment.  Pop that baby into the CD player at the end of the date, and I guarantee some action!!!

      I willingly let people into my heart.  I welcome them.  I make them feel at home.  And then they leave.  Or they hurt me in ways I didn't know possible.  And then leave.  Why do I continue to do this?  Why do I continue to have faith in human beings when I continue to get crushed?  You'd think I'd learn.  And I do, for a small period of time.  And then something happens.  I start to think "well, maybe this one is different."  At times I feel like I give and give, and my friends just take and take.  Is this friendship?  Why would you intentionally hurt a friend?  Even if you've gone through some bad times, I don't see the need for continual pain.  You cared about that person at one point in time.  How does that love just disappear?  How can you turn your back on someone you loved?  And how do those of us that love so deeply, few that we may be, heal from all these losses?  How do we learn to love again, and learn to be proud of our big hearts?

      Today started as a good day.  I had to do practice sessions for the essay portion of the GED.  This is usually not my job, but the English teacher who usually did these quit last week, so the assignment was handed over to me (me being an English teacher AND the GED teacher, this made complete sense).  At first I wasn't too happy about the situation, but once the students arrived, I was totally ecstatic.  See, I teach in a maximum secruity prison for juveniles.  I don't get to "teach" very often, since all my classes are mixed with different grade levels, and all the students are on different lessons.  It's more of a tutoring position rather than a teaching one.  But I digress.   I was stoked.  All the kids were attentive.  They were asking all sorts of questions, and hanging onto my every word.  I got to use my dry erase markers on the board.  I got to teach a whole class once again.  It's been a year and a half since I've experienced this, and I forgot how much I absolutely ADORE teaching.  Great day, right?  Then the principal and vice principal call me into the office and motion for me to shut the door.  They tell me they are thinking of hiring a social studies teacher instead of an English teacher (to replace the one that quit).  No problem, right?  Well, they've been kicking around the idea of having this new social studies teacher take over GED, and put me back to all English classes.  Talk about being punched in the stomach.  Ironic how they bring this up on the day I realize how much I adore my GED kids.  It's not fair.  This whole GED program is my baby.  I've developed it into what it is, and I have great visions for what it COULD be.  And now they're telling me it could be ripped away from me?  It's not a given, but it's a possibility.  A possibility to have my happiness taken away.  And why?  I've done nothing wrong; I've done everything right.  I've helped these kids.  I've improved their education!!!    Mom always told me life's a bitch.  I guess I just keep forgetting.

      Why am I so enamoured with an oversized rat?  I absolutely adore Mickey Mouse.  Is it his red shorts?  His nonchalant attitude of bearing his chest at all times?  Or is it his high-pitched voice always cheering "Hello boys and girls!"?  Who knows.  I just got back from Chicago where I saw twelve four feet tall statues of the great mouse.  Hopefully, I'll be able to post a picture of one here sometime soon.  That is, if I figure out how to upload the dang thing.  Computers.  Ugh!  Is it pathetic to be 26, hell, almost 27 and in love with Mickey Mouse?  I sure hope not.

      Lonliness is a bitch.  Ain't she?  What is it about her?  How does she sneak up on you like a shadow?  She's a darkness that overtakes you before you even know you've blinked.  The thing I hate about lonliness is you can be completely surrounded by those who love you and still feel her presence.    I am loved.  I don't have many friends, but I am loved.  My husband absolutely adores me.  He treats me wonderfully and romances me nonstop.  I have a great friend named Vanessa.  She knows me inside and out, yet we've only known each other a year.  I get to see her every work day, which is amazing.  Not many people get to see their friends five days out of the week.  Yet today, lonliness found me.  What's worse is she wouldn't leave.  I yelled.  I screamed.  I pushed.  But she just wouldn't leave.  Why does she have to be such a bitch?

      So, a friend of mine has a blog.  I didn't even know what the heck a blog was until he said "hey, go to my blog."  So I figured, "what the heck, let's go to his blog."  I then realized it is simply a place to put down thoughts.  I used to do this ALL the time way back in college.  I'm old now.  I make excuses why I don't have the time to write.  They're all lame, pathetic excuses.  He's a very busy man, so why can't a loser like me find time to write as well?    So here I am.  Yea me.  I have a blog.  "woo woo woo woo" (chanting and twisiting my arm Arsenio Hall style).  Okay.  That's enough for now.  We'll see how long this lasts.  I give it a week.

      Romance is not dead.&nbsp; Many people say it is, but it's not.&nbsp; My husband surprised me last weekend with a stay at a true bed and breakfast.&nbsp; It was our two year anniversary.&nbsp; He even had the host order a purple bouquet of flowers for me to be waiting there.&nbsp; It was adorable.&nbsp; The card said "Here's to two wonderful years with my greatest love and to the lifetime of memories we will share."&nbsp; And the best part is....he came up with that all on his own.&nbsp; Most people wouldn't believe that a man could come up with that.&nbsp; Amazing, I know.   I haven't written in ages.&nbsp; I just haven't had anything to write about.&nbsp; Why write about the mundane every day activities I undergo at work?&nbsp; You'd think I'd have a lot to write about since I work in a prison for juveniles.&nbsp; But no one wants to read about my boring events.&nbsp; But then I think about it.&nbsp; No one reads my blog.&nbsp; I'm being serious.&nbsp; No one reads it.&nbsp; So why should I care if I'm boring someone?&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Because there is no one.   "I would swallow my pride; I would choke on the rinds, but the lack thereof would leave me empty inside."&nbsp; Is it a  rine  of a fruit or a  rind  of a fruit?&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; Anywho.&nbsp; I heard this song (I know, it's old) on the way home today and that lyric hit me.&nbsp; It's genius.&nbsp; He'd take care of his pride, swallow it, just to save face.&nbsp; He'd even choke on his pride for this ex he's "through with."&nbsp; Yet he's throwing it back in her face, saying he has no pride whatsoever.&nbsp; He'd feel empty after eating it.   Why am I explaining these lyrics to you?&nbsp; Like you're stupid or something.&nbsp; Why am I even talking to you?&nbsp; You don't exist.&nbsp; No one is out there.&nbsp; Is the truth out there?&nbsp; I'm going insane.   Signing off now.&nbsp; You can stop reading.&nbsp; If you ever started.

      I must admit it.&nbsp; I love sappy movies.&nbsp; I adore them.&nbsp; One of my very favorite things to do is sit in a dark movie theater for 90-120 minutes and just sob away.&nbsp; I love a good cry. &nbsp; This time it was The Notebook.&nbsp; Don't go see this unless you want to bawl your eyes out.&nbsp; It is a completely idealistic movie about true, unadulterated, passionate love.&nbsp; Of course there are classic tones to it.&nbsp; Rich city girl.&nbsp; Poor country boy.&nbsp; Her parents hate him and forbid her to see him.&nbsp; They lose each other.&nbsp; She falls in love with rich boy.&nbsp; Poor boy finds her again.&nbsp; Don't worry--I don't intend on ruining the ending for you. &nbsp; There is something about love stories.&nbsp; They're so endearing.&nbsp; And you can always somehow relate.&nbsp; You can always find something in that story that has to do with you and your true love.&nbsp; I think that's what makes us cry so hard.&nbsp; Knowing that love is real.&nbsp; Love is true. &nbsp; Great sob fest.&nbsp; Loved it.&nbsp; Want to see it again.

      Ever fell off a bike?  Embarrassing, right?  What about fell off a bike in front of people?  The embarrassment grows then, doesn't it?  How about on a busy street?  You feel your cheeks getting redder, don't you?  How about when you're 26 years-old, you fall off your bike on a crowded street, right in front of your house, and then just lie in agony on the sidewalk while people drive by?  How's THAT for completely humiliating?  Yep, true story.  Happened to me.  Did you know that the left brake on a bike is your front brake, and the right brake is your rear brake?  I did NOT know this.  Why didn't someone tell me this?  Shouldn't this be in a manual or something?    I'm gaining speed, getting much closer to my house.  The wind is in my hair, my heart is pounding, everything is great.  I'm getting nervous because a turn is coming up, and I'm no good at turns.  I'm concentrating really hard.  Too hard, I guess, because I forgot to slow down.  So instead of easing on my brakes, I slam them.  Unfortunately, not knowing that the left brake is the front brake (see above paragraph), I hit that one harder.  Over the top of the bike I go.  I have scrapes on my hands.  I'm a whimp.  Scrapes are huge for me.  I also have a mondo-giant bruise growing on my upper left thigh.  That's where the bike landed on top of me.  Ever MORE embarrassing, though doubly-sweet, is the fact that three, yes THREE, cars turned around and came and asked if we (my very over-protective, freaking out by now, hubsand was with me..THANK GOD) needed help.  Isn't that sweet?  Everyone thinks I live in a bad neighborhood.  Mostly because black people live here.  *GASP*  Did I just say black people?  How COULD I possibly live near "those" people.  Sheesh.  But this just proves how great my neighborhood truly is.  Three couples took time out of their busy lives and turned around to see if a poor woman needed help.  That's awesome.  And just when I was beginning to lack faith in humanity.  I'm still totally embarrassed.

      Finally an original movie.  This film is full of purity, honesty, innocence, hope, passion, and of course jealousy and fear of the unknown.  It shows us who Americans truly are versus who we wish to be.  Victor, played by Tom Hanks, gives true meaning to the word innocence.  There is not an evil bone in this man's body.  Throughout the whole film, you laugh with him, cry with him, hope with him.  He has everything taken away from him, yet he does not break.  He stays true to his ethics.  To his being.  He has true love for humanity, and that never fades no matter how hard the corrupt try to rip it away from him.  He does all of this to keep a promise.    I wish there were more Victor's in the world.  I wish we could have a world like the one he lives in.  I wish people could see others the way he sees them.  Instead, we have more of the corrupt. More of the people who fear those like Victor.  They don't fear him because they dislike him or his morals.  They fear him because they don't understand him.  They can't fathom why he's so pure.  They can't even come close to knowing who he is, or what he is about.  Purity.  Honesty.  Innocence.  Hope.  That is what we are all missing.  That is what we need in order to fill the void we feel in our lives.  The question is: now that I have figured out what we need, how do we gain it?

      Friends are wonderful.  Friends are amazing.  No matter who you are, you need friends.  They're there to lift you up when you are down, and to also knock you down a few pegs when you get too full of yourself.  They stick up for you when you are too weak, and they force you to stand up for yourself when you're just being a puss.  I don't know what I'd do without my friends.  I may only have a few, but those few I have are near and dear to my heart.  I LOVE YOU GUYS!  (You all know who you are.  Actually, hell.  Only one of ya reads this.  Oh well)  I couldn't get through life without you.  I mean that.  Know that you are loved.  No matter what.  And I don't care if this is cheesy.  I like it.  Even if I AM entirely awkward with this post right now.  =P
