       ...And all the kings men couldn't put my poor PC together again. I've been having a few problems with my main windows box lately. Heavy disk utilization (I can hear the disk grumbling at me as we speak) and slow as molasses. The system isn't using any CPU cycles, just waiting for the disk to hurry the hell up. I'm getting corrupt file errors as well. Maybe I'll get a record for most lost hard disks in a certain period of time. This will be my third in a year. Running the disk check feature at the moment...and praying.  I wish everything I needed could be run on a Mac. (I NEED city of heroes. It's like crack, only not.) I would buy a g5 if my finances weren't spread across 2 platforms and the Mac had everything that I wanted. In a perfect world Be Inc would rise from the dead like a great phoenix and bless the land with it's heavenly media kit updated for the latest hardware, with networking and use and opengl. I can dream can't I?  I thought about giving Linux a fourth try on my old 1.2 GHz PC that I don't use. Visiting the osnews.com website regularly the Linux people have become more civilized for lack of a better phrase at the moment. Supposedly it's easy enough for your mother to use. I started on this journey tonight while watching over my ill PC. Ok! I'm going to go download a Linux ISO and jump into Linux again! *blank stare at the monitor* But which distro? I know names like redhat, suse, mandrake, lycoris and debian, but which one is right for me? First I went to redhat. Ok, fedora project, blah blah blah, beta.... hmmm... do I want a beta? They have ISO downloads...but 3 discs..I'll check Suse. Hi suse! Nice website, where are your isos? Only rpm packages and loose files...I'll pass. Then I checked out Lycoris and Xandros. Both consumer products you have to buy. Not free as in beer. They look nice, and are most likely easy to use. They have a good website at least. I then thought that I would look to the community for some advice. Browsing through a message board I found mention of mandrake which I had forgotten earlier. Most of what I found were many instability problems users had and why they didn't recommend the latest version, 10.0 I think. I will do more searching in the coming days and attempt to install Linux on my old box to see if it's ready for "prime-time" like I hear people say it is.

       I was alerted to blogger.com from the random CSS web design sites that I frequent while not doing work. It's nice to see good design accessible to so many internet users. Possibly gone are the days of bad google websites (and blog sites for that matter).  Though everyone will be using the same (12?) templates. Maybe they will periodically release new templates every so often. Back to work...
