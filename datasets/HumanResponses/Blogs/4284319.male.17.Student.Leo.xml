      there is a road that everyone follows, however the way of which we travel is different to others not that it matters, we all end up at the same place. i want her to understand that everything she could possible need, she could find in me. yet she doesn't seem to understand that i want her to be happy, even if that takes me out of the picture. sacrifice is something i have done, something im doing, and something that will be done. i always will. i want her to realise that i love her. even if she doesnt love me in return she needs to know. that way i actually tried to obtain that which is out of my reach.

      it has come to my attention that no matter what i do, it will never be good enough to win her over. why cant i get what it is that my heart longs for? it would seem that it is my life to have nothing that i want. i love her for her, and i cant have her. Destruction of my own soul seems imminent. i am not sure if i want it to happen or need it to happen. i guess that i will have to try and fight, always fighting yet nothing to fight for except myself and i dont want to fight for me. i dont want to fight. maybe i shold just let the world sweep me by and live not at all. death is looming and i will not be one to faulter in front of it. i will not allow the reaper to take me i will take the reaper.

      it seems to me that no matter when you talk to me i would be in love with some girl or other. maybe its just longing to be with someone... or maybe i just lust after a few different girls... either way it would seem that i can controll myself useually but when ever i am around a specific girl i can only do as she bids. i wonder why i feel so much.

      The torment that i put myself through seems to grow stronger with every breath, and every thought. for no matter what i do i care more then i dare to admit. i wish that i could show her just how much i love her and want to be with her. to be able to hold her in my arms and tell her everything is going to be all right. if i only had the guts to tell her how i feel and to be prepared to handle any answer she might give me. oh how i wish that i could make her happy........if only she would let me try. if i could only read her mind then i would be able to tell if my feelings for her are in vain. i want to belong to her and she to belong to me yet not make it so that we will suffocate each other. when ever i hear her voice it seems that a piece of me is growing. yet when ever she is not around i feel as if i am dieing. i feel so empty.... the pain inside is getting to be too much to bare. these whispers of a lonely heart are driving me insane. to end this pain i can think of only one thing....

      well useually when i write i write about things that matter to me. they useually dont matter to anyone else and i don't show most people what i have done until i finish it. it could take sometime for a few things to get here then it could be that i make 3 new things in a day it all varies. ohh well lets get started
