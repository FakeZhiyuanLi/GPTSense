      "Sit straight", i mumbled to myself, "but it's an impossible task" I told myself again as I slouched into my usual character. I steal a glance of her as i took out my History textbook from my bag, she is so beautiful. I look at her as the lesson went on until she turn and look at me, it seems that she notice me staring at her. I quickly preten to search into my bag for something, then she turn back and continue with the lesson.  I like her when i first saw her, ever since then i tried to get her contact. Thanks to the help of my friend i manage to get her contact, but i never got the guts to message or call her until one day my teacher told the class that we will have a barbercue at the end of the year. i know thats my chance, and i waited...  Finally that day came, as the class was having fun, i finally type a message and send it to her. She turn and look a me, I felt embarresed, but the smile on her face told me she accepted. We walk towards the beach and sat down, both of us said nothing, nothing, just sitting there looking at the sea and listen to the sound made by the waves.  We sat there quietly for 30 minutes until she made her first word, "look! thats the sunset". i turn and look at the sunset, it was so beautiful. I guess that's the problem with us city kids, we don't have time for such stuff. All we do every day is study, study and study. After watching the sunset, we went back to the barbercue pit and continue with day.  Not sure from when it happens, we became a couple. We spent time together in both school and outside school. We did things which i think couple does, like calling each other everyday, sending messages etc. etc.  Until the end of sec four, i told her i wanted a break up. Its not that i don't love her anymore, but i think break up is a better choice for both of us. We hug each other tightly for the last time, its different from all other hugs that we had before. I turn and walked away, i know she is at the back watching me. I wanted to turn back, but something deep in my heart told me no. There is no movement in her after i left, the only movement is the movement of her tears down her cheek. I waited after we broke up, waited for my wound to heal before i choose a new path to continue my life.
