      Hello people,    To the loyal followers of my blog, I must apologize for not updating my blog for quite a while... I haven't been in the mood lately.      Well, today I attended Hari Kecemerlangan. ;) I had to endure a lot of boring speeches... and I was seated next to WENG and he was so busy sharing his fantasies with me.. like I wanted to hear them *roll eyes*  And then Nigel took my phone and SMSed to gals something impolite... and I had to apologize to them. Grrrr.......... At least I got my 5 prizes later on!  I was also busy talking to my friends; Sanjit and  Jo Wearn while listening partially to  WENG.    Thats all for today ;)

      A transcript from the popular hit, the OFFLINE BLOG!  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.07 am  Status : 'Offline Blog' It's Moral now... Miss Sanggita (I think its spelled this way) entered into class although I predicted otherwise... Well... Nothing is sure in life. She is teaching us science instead if Moral. Concerning overfishing, we shouldnt catch those cute lil baby fishes, go for the big ones. She wants us to keep quiet. Keane wants my KH prize after he saw my invitation.. hehe. Keane just stated to the class that 'overanimaling' is as serious as overfishing. Class topic steered off course again and now the topic is music. Now we are encouraged to drink a little, supposedly its good for our health. Again she wants us to keep quiet since she doesnt believe in screaming at the top of her voicer. Dunno why Fung How and Eugene condemning Fletrisha in front of her, as though she can do anything... should complain to Miss Ma instead! Did some chem work.. not listening to her. Nigel just warned me not to write about him here but what to do? Said already too badlah.. He is probably camera shy or rather blog shy. Now Miss Sanggita (shes only 19!) is describing the evils of drinking. The class keeps steering her off course to talk crap. Lets see what we have discussed in the past hour. Protecting the environment -> Pollution -> Clubs in Bangsar -> Precautions when clubbing! ;) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.00 am Status : 'Offline Blog' Sanjit just said that Nigel is a nerd and doesnt want to be seen with him. This just sparked off one of the countless fights that have occured between them. Now Nigel is claming to be the best prefect! Nigel is trying to poison me by forcing me to breate fumes of burning plastic but I avoided. He just plotted to kill Kamil with the same method. In their fight, Nigel and Sanjit are behaving childishly, fighting over who knows what. They are playing around like small kids. Nigel's feelings are hurt.. How sad... "That was all a joke lah."  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 11:30 am Status : 'Offline Blog' Kamil, Sanjit and Nigel are fighting over who stole RM 20 from the prefect fund. They each want me to write down their own twisted version of the 'truth'. Keane is sweating all over, wonder what he has been doing. Now he is not in class .. ponteng... Looks like its going to rain.. Keane copied my wrong math homework. Haha! Can't wait to go home.. not that got anything special at home. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 12.35 pm Keane just sneezed and covered my hand with a lot of his saliva!! Gross! Its english now. Past Perfect Continuous .. I HAVE BEEN WRITING blogs since last week. Something that happened but continues to the present. Now PAST TENSES. We shouldnt be learning such basic grammar at this age.. Keane is trying to blackmail me for a scissors although I don't have one. Keane just embarassed me in front of the teacher!! He keep singing and chanting something that shouldn't be mentioned here in front of the teacher! Then he turned to the teacher and said "You know Joel........." and the teacher said "You are making him blush" !! Imagine!!! Its Nigel's fault cos now so many ppl are teasing me.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Listen to people talk in the morning. Then wrote an essay about communism (Actually, against communism, I advocate capitalism ;) ) I won a consolation prize in an Essay Writing Competition organised by the Oxford & Cambridge Society of Malaysia. That would put me in the 6th position out of a lot of students and I am more than just consoled! I was shocked but happy. ;) I was seriously not expecting to win anything. It was a boring day aside from that...

      Today I had a busy day.. was in FRIM the whole morning and spent the whole afternoon chatting and sleeping (busy huh). I won't bore you since I won't write much unless I have something humorous or interesting. :( To sum it up, I spent the day talking online to various friends. Goodnight and maybe there will be something good in store for tomorrow.

      My heart grows weary, At the things which came to past this day, So much of sorrow, So much of joy, I grow stronger each passing day, To face the challenges of life.  I sought solace in the wilderness, I sought for gold there, I found only vast plains, Of nothingness, Bearing many tears and wounds, I now seek the true road.   Is every equation balanced? Must there be insufficiency, To compensate for every talent? If so, A great gift, Carries a deadly curse.  In the dark valleys, Will I ever find a rose? Will I find it before it wilts, Or before I do so?   Written by Yours Truly. (In case you think I copied it.)

      Hello people, This is a transcript from my "Offline Blog", a whole school day.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.25 am    Status : "Offline Blog" Hello people, it's chemistry now. I am kind of bored since the teacher is not around and have decided to write today's offline blog. 1st of all, Nigel is worried that Pn Norzakia is agry with him. He is also worried that he did not get his PEKA file back. Rosal borrowed Nigel's beloved tie pin to destroy some pens. The teacher just left the class and there is havoc. Nigel doesnt want to be mentioned so much here so he called Kamil over but onstead they started debating about yesterday's issue (just scroll down). Now, I have to play arbitrator on the issue. Kamil wants Nigel to stand out of class, only because it never happened to him before. Rosal is playing football with some broken erasers. *sigh* The football fever is still in the air. Pn Norzakia has been out for oa while and I hope she stays out till recess. ;) "The king" is crapping with Nigel over some nobleness. They are both trying to imitate royalty but I think they sound soooo pathetic. I am looking for more interesting stuff to write about. Too bad.. the teacher is back.. :( Electrochemistry. Staring at Barath doing weird things with his pen. *Dozing off* some anion.. I thought it was pronounced "an-yawn" but its actually "an-eye-on"... Boring.. sleepy.. Yippee! Its recess. Ben wants to be mentioned in this blog so I here it is. -------------------------------------------------------------------- 10.30am Status : "Offline Blog" Welcome back again. It is history now. *Yawn* I expect to be bored. Sathes, Gurpreet, Thines, Sashi and Kanaga are supposed to do some extremely boring presentation. Their charts look dull and I can't read anything on it although I'm closest to it. Nigel just told me how Fletrisha ran away from him when he saw her. She must be shy seeing him. Hmmmm... I wonder why? Back to history.. they copied my group's notes! This is outrageous! At least the judges know the truth thanks to me. ;) Well, who cares anyway. At least I got my decent marks. Its kind of boring.. actually VERy BORING. The class is occupied doing their own thing while Devan is reading his chem book. Some are even sleeping! Didnt know history was tainted with foul language. Well, at least not in the text book but those idiots are rewriting history with not-so-polite language. I'm not paying any attention. Just wondering why those dead people have such weird names like Bustatumin. I see Ridhwan running away from Nag, I didnt know what was going on. After that, Sugadesh was wrestling with Nag over some books. What a pest he has become lately. Uh... there are problems now, we all have to answer the teachers Questions. I could answer the simple question! The class got unsettled when Kamil couldnt answer the question. Well.. there was an elimination game and those who couldnt answer had to do some weird things. Haha! Nigel is saying that he is the best prefect in the world and the head prefect!  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 11.35 am  Status : "Offline blog" Grrr... Its add math now and I dont have my book! I'm going to kill  Keane! Nothing much to say.. its english now not add math anymore. Subject-verb agreement.... HAVE I been crapping to much or HAD I been crapping to much? Hearing Pn Bhawani talk, it reminds me of what David said yesterday. Apparently 4 Hijau likes to stare at her. I will refrain from going into more perverted details here, or I might die if she found out.. 30 minutes and school is over!!! Ben just tried to whack Kamil's forehead. Sanjit is so desperate to be mentioned here that he tried to pull off a stunt. He tried to force "the king" to bow down to him but only managed to whack his forehead twice! ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MATH DRAMA!!! 12.50 pm  Status : "Offline Blog" Miss Mah walked into class late today. She started teaching us about accumulative frequency or something like that. Suddenly Miss Mah blew off her top and started scolding those who did not do their homework. She then forced those who didnt do their work to get out of the class. 30+ students ended up out of class in a few minutes. Now, only Devan, Kamil, Rosal, Sanjit and me are left in the class. Then when Miss Mah checked their work, the others had to get out of the class due to incomplete work. Then Keane walked nicely into the class telling me he gave my Add Math book to Azrie. Now it's only me in the class! WOW! This is great! :) Devan just entered the class. I wasnt expecting a climax at the end of the day. Miss Mah was so mad and still scolding. She scolded Jared for asking her for a pencil. In more precise words "AM I A STATIONARY SUPPLIER!?" Hahahahahahaha.  It is 1.10pm now and school is dismissed. Miss Mah then ordered all the students into the class. Then she locked all of 'em except me and Devan! ;) She left the class and said she will free them at 1.50pm. Students from other classes come and jeer. At 1.30pm the class is almost riotous. Some attempt to break the lock. A sudden appearance of Pn Marriam made the class quiet instantly. At 1.50 pm, I follow Miss Mah from the canteen to the class. They are all begging to be released, they gave reasons like "I'm late for tuition". Miss Mah replied cooly "I coulnt give two hooks a care" or something of that sort. She then made sure she went through their books and made sure each one did their work before letting them out one by one. Those whose work was incomplete had to stay back even longer to do it. 2.15pm, I can't wait any much longer watching this drama. Someone who doesnt want to be named, was turned away a few times before Miss Mah let him out. Voon Ying tried to use Devan's book to show that he did his work but Miss Mah was smarter, she found out. ;) -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Thats all for todays 'offline blog' transcript.  My offline blog seems to be a hit and people like reading it. :D Well after school, June was just raving about some chemistry experiment she did. She was attempting to create her own jewelry from skeletons (Calcium carbonate actually ;) ) and from Lead and Iodine.  Nigel's blog is at http://www.wannigel.blogspot.com/ and he wants 10 reasons why not to hate me.. Can anyone help him? I certainly can't. Now everyone wants a blog after reading mine. Haha... I get to become a trend-setter. I'll add more here tonight.

      Hello people, Welcome to my blog spot... ;) You may not understand what is going on since I'm writing spontaneously on what is happening around me. I just told Nigel what Kamil told Pn Norzakia. So I heard, Nigel called up Kamil instantly to confirm it but Kamil changed his story.  *roll eyes* I just typed from my "offline blog" to prove that Kamil did say that Nigel wanted us to be MIA during chemistry periods. I wonder why so few people are actually online, while those that are online are busy or away... Now Keane is apologizing for forgetting to return my add math book. I was just playing around with Nigel scaring him about how angry Pn Norzakia was over that statement. Now Nigel is quite worried from the way he is talking that he may be in hot soup.  Back to what happened today, I missed a whole day of school today. I'm happy (missed some boring biology and history periods *Yippee* but missed some Maths periods *shivers*) Besides that I missed my accounts tuition. *more shivers* I only came home at 4.30 pm after walking to the LRT station with Ben and very tired... but it was fun wearing a lab coat and messing around with the lab tools. I received an email from an old friend Jun Ai and messages from other old friends. I seem to be mistaken for another Joel from SSP. *Frustrated*  Earlier on, June saw my bunny via web-cam and kept saying "SO CUTE!!! SO CUTE!!! I WANT!!!". I guess most gals just love such furball bunnies. ;) Syahmi was kind of mysterious. He didnt want to tell me who dumped him although it was clearly not his so-called girlfriend. I suspect its just a pathetic joke.  It looks I may have just sparked off a new craze with this blog. Now Nigel is getting a blog after reading mine. I'm sure everyone will start getting a blog spot. Anyway, I'm running low on inspiration to write poems.. If you didnt know of my poem site, its at http://www.mystcaverns.tk/ Hmmm.. looking back at what I've typed, not bad for my first official entry. I've school tomorrow. Goodnite ppl. :D

      To the loyal fans of my blog(Which includes you if you are reading this) , I am soooo sorry for not updating my blog for so long. I've kind of forgotten I have a blog and thanks to Ben and Nigel for reminding me to do it.  So what happened today in school? Nothing very much... But the part about the class vase being filled with urine was gross but kind of hilarious. :)  I skipped the SONY science experiment thingy cos I had tuition. Now I'm doing my new site,  http://academiaveritatis.netfirms.com/ Do visit it!
