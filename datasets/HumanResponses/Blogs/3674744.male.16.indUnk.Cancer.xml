      holidays been coolio so far, yeah people keep sayin coolio to me, anyway party went better than i thought, only had people come i knew well so it wasn't one of those massive ones but still thought it was all good. one of my friends probaly dosn't think so, he went down the road with a few other people and ended up gettin caught with weed and a bong.  so that's the 2nd person i know now that's goin to court because of that.  hmm, what else, almost ended up goin for an urban ride in the city yesterday. burnin spears down the road is havin a sale, so think i'll go and get some clothes, hate shoppin so i think i'll buy heaps so i wont have to go again for a while.  still got isaac's speakers and music here, which is cool cause i'm slowly workin my way throu all of his music.  oh yeah was goin to have people over to watch the state of origin cause the party worked so well, but the TV wont work down stairs. dam :(.  tomorrow i'm gonna see if my dad can take me and a few people to do shuttle runs down mt cootha, lookin forward to that, if that dosn't happen i'll probaly end up goin for that urban ride in the city.  anyone got any ideas for bordom, know it's gonna catch up to me sometime in the holidays.  lol, know what i'm gonna do if i get really bored, buy a heap of plastic cups, and then ya tape em together on the sides and if u keep doin that u end up with a giant cup ball! how cool is that! and yeah i also think i'm a bit wierd.

      still gotta finish phoning people up bout the party gonna ave on the weekend, hmm, spose i could be doin that now.  had a day off today and don't have to go tomorrow, just got a math test on friday and then it's the holidays!  went out to a four pac of jumps today, it was good, we borrowed someones wheelbarrow and some council workers spade and we fixed em up so that they were more like tabletops.  oh yeah watched the return of the king dvd this mornin, well half of it anyway, think i'll watch the rest tonight or tomorrow.  really gotta study for my maths test tomorrow, so much stuff to learn :(.  found out that reanan likes me today, dunno what i think of her, nvr really talked to her much.  know she's havin a party saturday night, probaly go, few people r goin i really don't like, but yeah i'll just avoid em.  mines sunday night.  this is really startin to anoy me, tryin to get over bec cause she's goin out with luke and his one of my best friends, it's not happening.  was talkin to her just befor bout the party, everytime i talk to her it just gets harder.  not sure what she'd do if i told her i liked her, know she dosn't hate me but that dosn't mean she likes me.  somethin else that's frustratin is that i'm not even sure how much bec and luke like each other cause they're always actin fridget towards each other. um what else, yeah some dog was at the jumps and it wouldn't go away, it was cool and all, but it kept on standin right infront of the jumps! it was like suicidal or somethin.  and then it started followin us home.  so threw the stick over the other side of the creek, this dog was like unstoppable, it ran through all the bushy stuff, jumped off the embankment into the water, and up the other side that was all rocky and steep.  so that was my day

       urlLink    wanted to go see kill bill2 today cause i saw the first one just the other day, but the only cinema it was showin in was in SA, how screwed up is that.  ended up goin out to these dirt jumps, they're not as good as in the old pic i got.  the 4 pac looks as thou it hasn't been done in ages and the first jump for the 6 pac has been cut in half to try and make it a table top :( .  The tabletop and the jump over the berm is still all good thou.  There's a wood roll in there too that u can't see.  In my exam period now, dosn't bother me too much, get a few days off and only ave to rock up at school when i've got an exam.

      yeah got reminded it was sunday today, i loose track of the days in the holidays which is cool cause then i don't know how many more i got left, so layed back now, probaly gonna take me the first week just to get back into doin school stuff.  anyway school isn't all that bad, just gets a bit borin and repetative. had to think for a while what i done yesterday and then i was like, oh yeah went fishin, always seem to be loosin track of what i do, anyway today went to the city for an urban ride, not as interested in ridin as i used to be, i reckon dirt jumpin's still the best outta all the stuff i do.  hmm just thought of somethin, i'm not gettin adrenaline much anymore from ridin, sucks!  the way i'm headin probaly end up skydivin eventually.  anyway didn't really ave anythin to do at the mo, so decided to blog.

      dad gave me and a few people a lift to mt cootha today, and yeah me and tyson got to the bottom and his like shit, looks like he stacked, looked up the track and my friends lyin on the side of the track covered in dirt and his bikes a few more metres down from him.  walkin up there and tyson's like he musta been tired his already gone to sleep and snorin.  thought he was jokin and get up there and i'm like dam think his unconscious.  he was out for bout 2 mins or so and then didn't know where he was or what was happenin for a while, anyway didn't break anythin, just gonna have a few decent scares when he gets back to school.  yeah anyone that thinks they're too cool to wear a helment is a dumb ass, cause he had rocks embedded deep into his.  can't remember if i said i was plannin to have the state of origin at my place but i can't anymore cause there's no antana connection down stairs so the tv wont work down there, anyway just have it at someone elses place.  oh yeah almost forgot, scored a leather billabong wallet today from my uncle and aunty for my birthday.  they always seem to get me somethin good :).  avn't really got anythin else planned so far, saw shrek 2 yesterday with my dad and brother, didn't know if i'd like it but it made me laugh so yeah go and see it.

      was so pissed off, just got the computer back and there's still things not working.  aaarrrr so frustrating, i don't have msn anymore and I can't even check my hotmail stuff now.  anyway, I went to a party last week, that was ok, it just needed more people.  oh yeah, thx lin, i was talking to a few people about anime and I mentioned kenshin to ryan and his like, that's samuria X right?  and I found out james has a few anime series on dvd, can't remember what they were thou.  um what else,  just been dirt jumping a fair bit, I think it's the only thing that gets rid of stress for me.  I did have a cold, I stayed home today, but I feel all better now.  just remembered something, i've forgotten to clean my fish tank again, i'll ave to do that tomorrow.  kinda looking forward to school tomorrow, I miss talking to people more than I probaly should.  Something else that's anoying me at the mo is that I got told I have this job with a friends dad, but I still havn't been able to talk to him about it so I don't know what's happening.  I tell ya the short version of what happened at mt cootha, my friend stacked and got knocked out and was snoring and then wouldn't wake up until we poured water on him.  then he didn't know where he was and keep on asking us who took his gloves and helmet off, but he took em off just after he woke up.  he asked us that like 3 times.  something else that's happening with me is that i'm seeing one of my friends getting more and more involved in drugs, I don't think I have to worry about him getting addicted to stuff thou cause his not that kind of person, but yeah, not sure how its all going to turn out.  I've started wrighting a short story for english, i'm not too sure if it's very good cause it dosn't seem to have a proper climax or many twists in it, it just kinda flows and i'm not sure if people r goin to think it's interesting because of that.  anyway it's bout this surfer guy who gets stuck in the outback doing community service and then has to find his way back to the beach.  Tristan and I got bored the other day at my place so we got this old bike with 20 inch size wheels from the 70's that was lying under the house, if anyone knows what a cruiser is, it looks like that.  anyway, got my old pity, that's an even smaller bike, it was my first bike so ya get an idea how small it was, and yeah got the front wheel off that and put it on the cruiser.  Then we decided the cruiser needed to be riden in public.  went everywhere, stopped off at maccas for a bit, the coolest bit of the day was seeing peoples expressions in cars.  i heard of some cool german rock bands, stahlhammer, stactic X, there was another one but i can't remember it.  tyson got an ipod, i was thinking of getting an mp3 player or something but i think i'll just save up and get something different.  if i can get a job i'll save up for a downhill bike so i can start racing, if i don't get that job with my friend's dad, probaly end up at maccas, and then while i'm working there i'll try and get a better one at coles/myer or kmart or something, still not sure what i wanna do after school.  hmm, i have to think of something to do for work experience with school too, want something interesting but i can't think of anything.  anyway i'm wrightin heaps too much again
