      Hey hey all you loyal fans out there in radio land . . . . ok ok ok, i know i dont have any loyal fans . . . . and i ALSO know im not on the radio . . . but my point still stands! I know i havent posted in like a month . . . . but what can ya do? I've been busy, stop hassling me.      So quite a bit has happened since I last posted . . . but most of the shit is mundayne and insignificant, so i wont bother you with the boring play by play of the last while . . . .       So on friday here at school they brought the drug dogs in, luckily I dont do that type of thing, and had no reason to fear getting busted, but some of my friends did! it was kinda funny because one of my friends had some hooch, and another just had a pipe and some rolling papers, and they got the EXACT same punishment. The interesting part of that is that drug paraphernalia* sp is not against the rules in our school, or in the legal system here where I live . . . . i find it a little odd that the two guys would get the same punishment when one didnt even break any rules. Fuckin' arbitrary bullshit, I think that i can get my friend's suspension repealed, but he doesnt want me to . . . . i just feel as if students get no respect, and they discriminate against us because of out age.      During the drug search, the teachers dont even get searched! I know the odds are slim that a teacher would bring their stash to the school, but its still a possibility! they are discriminating against us like were second class trash! I feel like a black man in the 30's, SOLIDARITY! we might fight the power, fight the POWER THAT BE! quoted from the great NWA.      Im just sick of all the injustice that I have to live with in today's society, All this infrastructure is finally starting to get to me, I just need to be free of all the limitations that hold me down.      Well i just got into a big theological conversation here with a couple guys in my science class, and i dont have much more time to finish this, so im gonna end this here and now, and i'll post something else later on, later guys.       -The Slut

           So theres not much goin on right now . . . i went to prom there on saturday night . . . . everyone looked really hot, except the guys, most of them looked like real jackasses. My friend matt had a pretty neat outfit, he told me it was the traditional dress of his dad's heritage back in new zealand. He also had henna art done on his face, and legs . . . it looked pretty awesome. The dinner was kinda crappy, and the dancing was even worse for the mostpart, I think it was just a way for the town to make money on rentals, booze, and flowers . . . because there really wasnt that much to it. After dinner, my date and I went out to my friend's SUV with him, and we smoked a big joint, and we smelled really badly of weed when we went in, so i stayed outside to talk to some of my friends who were getting some air. After that little shindig, i went out to a couple more parties, and got a bit wasted, but not near as much as some people i was with, hahaha.       I got a funny email today, and i thought i'd share some of it. It's a logged cybersex session that goes a bit wrong . . . Its a long read, but it's well worth it in my opinion.   Wellhung: Hello, Sweetheart. What do you look like?   Sweetheart: I am wearing a red silk blouse and a miniskirt and high heels. My measurements are 36-24-36. I work out every day. I'm toned and perfect. What do you look like?   Wellhung: I'm 6'3" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a pair of blue sweatpants I just bought at Walmart. I am also wearing a T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner - it smells a little funny.   Sweetheart: I want you. Would you like to screw me?   Wellhung: OK.   Sweetheart: We're in my bedroom. There's soft music playing on the stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I'm looking up into your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge.   Wellhung: I'm gulping. I'm beginning to sweat.   Sweetheart: I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.   Wellhung: Now I'm unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.   Sweetheart: I'm moaning softly.   Wellhung: I'm taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.   Sweetheart: I'm throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk slides off my warm skin. I'm rubbing your bulge faster, pulling and rubbing.   Wellhung: My hand suddenly jerks spastically and I accidently rip a hole in your blouse. I'm sorry.   Sweetheart: That's OK, it wasn't really too expensive.   Wellhung: I'll pay for it.   Sweetheart: Don't worry about it. I'm wearing a lacy black bra. My soft breasts are rising and falling, rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder.   Wellhung: I'm fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it's stuck. Do you have any scissors?   Sweetheart: I take your hand and kiss it softly. I'm reaching back and undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my breasts. My nipples are erect for you.   Wellhung: How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting the clasp.   Sweetheart: I'm arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your tongue all over me.   Wellhung: I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know, breasts. They're neat!   Sweetheart: I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm nibbling your ear.   Wellhung: I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit.   Sweetheart: What?   Wellhung: I'm so sorry. Really.   Sweetheart: I'm wiping your spit off my breasts with the remains of my blouse.   Wellhung: I'm taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a *plop*.   Sweetheart: OK. I'm pulling your sweatpants down and rubbing your hard tool.   Wellhung: I'm screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!   Sweetheart: I'm pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties.   Wellhung: I'm pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over, in and out, nibbling on your ... umm ... wait a minute.   Sweetheart: What's the matter?   Wellhung: I've got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I'm choking.   Sweetheart: Are you OK?   Wellhung: I'm having a coughing fit. I'm turning all red.   Sweetheart: Can I help?   Wellhung: I'm running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I'm fumbling through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?   Sweetheart: In the cabinet to the right of the sink.   Wellhung: I'm drinking a cup of water. There, that better.   Sweetheart: Come back to me, lover.   Wellhung: I'm washing the cup now.   Sweetheart: I'm on the bed, aching for you.   Wellhung: I'm drying the cup. Now I'm putting it back in the cabinet. And now I'm walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it's dark. I'm lost. Where's the bedroom.   Sweetheart: Last door on the left at the end of the hall.   Wellhung: I found it.   Sweetheart: I'm tuggin off your pants. I'm moaning. I want you so badly.   Wellhung: Me too.   Wellhung: Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately - our naked bodies pressing against each other.   Wellhung: Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.   Sweetheart: Why don't you take off you glasses?   Wellhung: OK, but I can't see very well without them. I place the glasses on the night table.   Sweetheart: I'm bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby!   Wellhung: I have to pee. I'm fumbling my way blindly across the room and toward the bathroom.   Sweetheart: Hurry back, lover.   Wellhung: I find the bathroom. It's dark. I'm feeling around for the toilet. I lift the lid.   Sweetheart: I'm waiting eagerly for your return.   Wellhung: I'm done going. I'm feeling around for the flush handle, but I can't find it. Uh-oh!   Sweetheart: What's the matter now?   Wellhung: I've realized that I've peed into your laundry hamper. Sorry again. I'm walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my way.   Sweetheart: Mmm, yes. Come on.   Wellhung: OK, now I'm going to put my ... you know ... thing ... in your ... you know ... woman's thing.   Sweetheart: Yes! Do it, baby! Do it!   Wellhung: I'm touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss your neck. Umm, I'm having a little trouble here.   Sweetheart: I'm moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can't stand it another second! Slide it in! Screw me now!   Wellhung: I'm flaccid.   Sweetheart: What?   Wellhung: I'm limp. I can't sustain an erection.   Sweetheart: I'm standing up and turning around, an incredulous look on my face.   Wellhung: I'm shrugging with a sad look on my face, my weiner all floppy. I'm going to get my glasses and see what's wrong.   Sweetheart: No, never mind. I'm getting dressed. I'm putting on my underwear. Now I'm putting on my wet, nasty blouse.   Wellhung: No wait! Now I'm squinting, trying to find the night table. I'm feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, picture frames and your candles.   Sweetheart: I'm buttoning my blouse. Now I'm putting on my shoes.   Wellhung: I've found my glasses. I'm putting them on. My God! One of your candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I'm pointing at it, a shocked look on my face.   Sweetheart: Go to hell. I'm logging off, you loser!   Wellhung: Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!  Anywho . . . I guess thats about it . . . . and just remember kids, purple monkey dishwasher.

           Hello to all of you out there in radioland, it's been an eventful couple of days . . . . too bad you dont get to hear about them! right now im waiting to download a program that will allow me to make the movie i'm making for science . . . its gonna be a stop motion film about chemical warfare, when im done it will be pretty funny. It's a short film where the actors are small figures made out of fiunny shaped pipe cleaners . . . i spent almost 45 minutes making both of the figures . . . and I think they look OK, but on the camera, they dont look all that good. The one is evil, and the other is gonna get melted . . . .        Ok, so between that last paragraph and this one, I smoked a bowl, attached wires to the evil guy to i dont have to hold it directly in front of the camera . . . and made a stand for my webcam so i can record it all . . . . arent I resourceful? they dont call me Steve for nothing you know . . . oh yeah, and that thing that I have to download for the stop motion to work is gonna take like 5 hours! nuts eh? ah well . . . im starting to babble, arent I? oh well! Its my blog and I'll babble if i damn well feal like it!       Sorry I dont have much interesting to say . . . like I said before, Im not really sure what im doing yet, so the posts are gonna suck for a while . . . and its true . . . but i assure you they'll get better, so keep comin back . . . because I just have a fealing that this will eventually get interesting, and maybe even WORTH reading . . . wierd eh? well anywho . . . I think thats about all the uninteresting crap I have to say tonight! but if any of you actually want to see the movie when im done, i'll be more than happy to show it to you! but seeing as how ive run out of things to say . . . i think i'll end 'er here.       Adios

           So here I am sitting in front of the computer when i thought to myself, "self," (and i knew it was me because i recognised the voice) i thought "self, dont you have a blog now?" And then after trying to remember my password for about 20 minutes, it dawned on me! So I logged in, and here I am, posting to all of my hoards of fans.        Hey, wanna hear about my day? well too damn bad, youre gonna hear about it anyways! So today was pretty much like any other day, pretty mundane and bland . . . not a whole lot went on. I went to school as usual, had a "code red" drill,(what a bunch of bull) got pissed off at a couple of my teachers for being so damn ignorant as usual. Although lunch was a little different, a really good friend of mine was fealing kinda down, so i sat with her for most of it, we talked mostly. After lunch I went to my afternoon classes, then got on the bus and went home. When I got home I did some unicycling . . . blah blah blah . . . drove around town . . . blah blah blah . . . and here we are at 8:30! boy does time ever fly when youre gapping out.       So for all you n00bs out there, i'd better tell you a little more about me seeing as how this is only my second post and all . . . im a pretty laid back kinda guy, and I like to take things at a relaxed pace. That relaxed pace sure does get me in a shitload of trouble though, hehehe. Im a pretty big procrastinator, and I havent really had any short, or long term goals in a looooong time, but who needs 'em? im 17, i deserve to be a free willed teenager that does whatever I like . . . or at least i'd like to think so! This is probably really boring for all yous guys, but TOO BAD, cause I cant think of anything else to type about! oh wait . . . im getting something . . .       So prom is coming up this saturday, and seeing as how this is my senior year and all . . . I thought I should go, just for tradition's sake. I'm not really too thrilled about it though, I dont look too good in a suit, I dont dance . . . ever, and its turning out to cost ALOT of money. I'll be glad when it's all over, no more hassle, and hopefully everyone will be in a better mood after getting loaded and fucking each other like wild dogs. Well thats pretty much all thats on my mind right now . . . so I think i'll be off to do the same thing I do every night       -Adios!

           Ok, so I thought I'd jump on the bandwagon and start posting a blog . . . so here I am posting my first . . . . post . . .        Here I am sitting in front of my computer doing absolutely nothing as usual, figured this might be a way to get down my thoughts in an organised way, AND cut back on the incredible boredom that i suffer from time to time. This being my first blog/diary/anything along those lines, It's gonna be pretty rusty at first, but I hope it gets better quickly. My apologies in advance. hehehe       Now for the juicy bits . . . . how about I start off with an introduction for all the people who (hopefully) read this, and DONT know me? well I'm Steve . . . and im a bit of an arogant guy, I like to think of myself as a pretty inteligent person, but sometimes i even doubt that myself. I ride a unicycle, I play many musical instruments (Tuba, trombone, bass guitar, etc...) or should i say I used to play many musical instruments, and im pretty good with electronics. I dont really do much of anything these days though, I guess thats why im such a morose guy, but I'm ok with it right now. I dont have a job, nor have I in almost a year . . . i feal that i needed some time to sort my personal issues out . . . and now that theyre still pretty fucked up, i think im ready for another job, but actually finding one after doing next to nothing for quite a while is a big task in itself . . .       I guess that's a fair size for a post considering I havent written anything about myself . . . ever, so untill next time . . .  -adios

           Hey there, I know I dont post alot, and some of you have recently brought that follie to my attention . . . . cough . . . . So here I go once again!       So the other day I went to my grad . . . as part of the audience, I didnt have all that much fun though. It made me feal really sad to see all my friends again who I wont be seeing for a long time, and I slammed my bottom pierce off of a wall and it bled like crazy. After that though I got to have fun at a party, where everyone was drunk except for me and the guy I was hanging out with. I dont really know why I said I was having fun . . . because I really wasnt, so my friend and I took off to his place and went to bed. Fun grad night, eh? (props to canada)      Still I feal like Im a car . . . and the gas guage is on "E", its not even that I dont have alot of energy, I guess its the same old story . . . . not having any motivation, or goals or anything. Though quite recently things have been getting a bit better it seems, people around me are in this downward spiral and they are all feeling down, and my life is finally starting to look up . . . . well not really up, but at least I have more confidence. Now that my ex and I have broken up, I'm starting to notice alot of girls coming after me . . . its not that I don't like it, its just that its kinda overwhelming at first . . . especially those few girls that seem kinda creepy at times, they're REALLY overwhelming. (Dont worry, Im not talking about you.)       One of my old friends from out of town is coming for Canada Day weekend, I hope she brings a shred of happiness with her, and I hope even more that it rubs off on me. I feel so lonely sometimes, and she always seems to shake that feeling away, so lets hope it works again. I'm not sure what else I can write here this morning . . . . But I'll try to rant a little more often for those of you who care.       Happy Hoppin Canada Day, you freak.           -Forgotten
