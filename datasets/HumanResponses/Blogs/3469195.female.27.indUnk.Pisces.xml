      This morning, my body aches from the exercise i did yesterday.  Got up and prepared breakfast: 1. a can of tomyum tuna / 170 calories / protein 2. 3 microwave egg-white with fat-free cheese / 100 calories / protein 3. 1 miso soup / 50 calories 4. 1 teaspoon of peanut butter / 80 calories / carb  5. 1 can of diet coke / 0 calories  Total : 400 calories  Exercise: 150 calories /bike   Nett: 250 calories  Lunch @ 2pm: Yong tau foo soup ( assortment of tofu and vegetables soup) Dinner @ 9pm: same yong tau foo soup   Supper @ midnight: sneaked 2 peanut pancakes and fried noodles (5 mouthful) . Felt moody and seeked comfort food.  Pros for the day: Did my exercise and had fun learning new stuff at my electric guitar class. Oh regular bowels! And yes! lots of gas too. lol  cons for the day: Ate after 8pm. Ate supper. Had 1 carb meal (supper)  Lessons from experience...: Try not to eat late. Try to eat lesser. No supper esp carbs!  Going to jog min of 2.4km tomorrow to burn the carbs i ate just now.

      Day 5, all meaty stuffs. Not losing weigh..yet producing large amount of ketones as tested with the ketone strip. I guessed I have simply eaten too much food/calories to allow weight lost.  Day 6, had tom yum steamboat with all the protein selections for lunch, and mum's cooking for dinner ( took only protein stuff as well). Ketones: trace. Beats me why ketones level went zero, probably eaten some hidden carbs somewhere. Btw, I ate so much my stomach hurts. I know i should be eating much less.  Day 7, ok. Going to introduce vegetables back into my life. Getting indigestion and all from the past days of meat eating. I felt toxicated, burping all the time.  Breakfast: nil Lunch: salmon caesar salad @ coffee bean + 1 cup coffee Dinner: soy sause chicken 5 choppped pieces, vegetables stir fry, soup @ mum's place. Supper: one bite of cheese ( cravings ) Exercise: evening jog on treadmil distance 2.6km. Weight at this moment. Exactly the same as day 1  I think with the diet im doing, its as if im trying to prove a point that u can eat lots of protein crap and get away with no weight gain. The setback is, indigestion, discomfort, bloatedness..   Btw, vegetables must be created in heaven.

      Had a morning business seminar to attend at swissotel in cityhall today. For lunch, I searched for more than 1 hour trying to find a place that serves carb-less food. Impossible, not even cafe cartel and their st louis ribs, its coated with sugared (carbs) gravy and side dish of vegs and fries. Walked out of the diners and walked the entire citylink, its amazing how every restaurant in city hall and city link are carb based. Crepes, Nooch noodles, breadtalk, cafes serving salad and pastas, pizzas, japanese, subway sandwiches, burger king burgers... list goes on.  I ended up at plaza singapura's food court, ordered fish soup and finally gastronomically satisfied.   Bought cables and a music book for my electric guitar lesson next tuesday. Got some crochet stuffs at spotlight,intend to crochet a pink pouch for myself.  Dinner - chinese restaurant @ purvis street. Some pork chop, some chicken breast, some fried prawn eggs and seafood soup.   I still miss carbs, but what i miss most is vegetables and wholesome fruits. Oh yes, I bought Ketone test sticks from the pharmacy today. Hopefully I wil be motivated enought to pull through this strange atkin induction period.   As for weight lost... no gain, no lost...... after 4 days of effort. I must be doing something not too right. Will have to cut down: 1. processed meat 2. fried meat 3. skins 4. gravies 5. breaded stuffs  Let learn and move on... Atkins, here i come.. 10 more days to VEG day!

      ok i weigh in and didnt lose or put on any. I am going to postpone burning my atkin's book. My diet for the day was really crappy. I had fried meat stuff (yong tau foo dry with all the fried meat items) for lunch. Dinner was mcdonalds. 1 box of Fish dippers, 1 box of mcnuggets and 1 box of mc wings. Its totally gross! Come to think of it, they are breaded. Gosh, that means there's carb!  Whats going to happen to me? Eating all these high fat crap. I really miss my fruits and vegetable servings.  Maybe i will be able to burn the atkins book tomorrow when i weigh in.  Pray that the scale wont rocket tomorrow.

      Day 2 into my atkins diet and im already feeling eeks! Been eating nothing but meat and eggs for meals. This atkins diet concept of strictly no carbs for 14 days still blows me! No veggies and no fruits, more meat and all those arteries clogging stuff to lose weight. I am going to weigh in tomorrow and if i gain any weight, I am so going to burn my atkin's book.  Otherwise, today is pretty unevent. Dragged myself to work again. Does anyone feel as wasted as i do after a day's work? Let me meditate on that.

Seriously, I am feeling like a pig from outer space. Feeling so terrible about my lack of self discipline.   I gotta eat less!
