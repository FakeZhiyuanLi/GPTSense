           Friday, August 20, 2004      Yesterday my mother and I went to Savashi spring near from of Firouzkouh city; it was nice picnic and I want to tell about it. After a little walking, we have to cross the river on foot for about 2 hours and after that we found out a beautiful hill for having lunch there many pretty girls were there but I couldn’t find anyone to get friendship. The second river which we had to cross it remain about 2 hours and at end of the river we found out a pretty waterfall there which called Savashi Waterfall . It enjoys it and I want to recommend you if you are near to Tehran go on and have a fun there.  Regards; Shahab Katebi  Email;      shahab_kate@yahoo.ca

      Sunday, August 15, 2004   There is a thing happen in these days; some of the things happened that I want to write it. The very important things, which occurred to the all over the world is Olympic competition that held on Greece (Athena) ok I want to write something about it. As you know all the teams from all over, the world will come together in peace and play most of the sport games in it. On the day of starting when all the countries got together and getting the line to the anniversary the play was too exciting and it comes from the ancient Greece to modern life. A D.J there played local national music of any country. The festival was to exciting but the miserable happen which occurred were about my national team’s country (Iran) when the narrator called Iran, none of the announcer clapped hands and there were no sound played by the D.J . I shamed of myself that why my country which has longer ancient and culture than Greece, manner like this you because of my government you know the government of my country prepare all the weapons to all the terrorist groups in all over the world.  Ok if you have, any comments call me.  Best Wishes;  Shahab Katebi  Email;  urlLink shahab_kate@yahoo.ca

        Thursday, August 12, 2004  Today I have watched a movie, which called Contact the player was              Judi Foster I do not like her so much but she acts as a professional actor, any way the movie had talked about any contact to other natures as like as Alien. I do not know whether in this Global have any nature or not but the most important thing is for far away we cannot contact to each other clearly. I am trying to be professional in my life but I do not know what exactly do to progress my life and be good person as an executive or any fucking thing. well this my 7th time that I want to be good in my English but day after day my language got to be worst just like as an asshole.

        Well the most incredible thing in this world is music .many musician are in this world; which always brand new songs to markets. but the bad things is most of them don’t have enough capacity to listen it too much as like as  pink Floyd for example all of you know  Britney Spears; She got too bad foolish music to people but the bad things in this life is not only the people but also the producers accompanies with them . I do not know why these people never have enough thinking that each of the pink Floyd songs got about 3 months...  I wish all the people will have good thinking and understand the important things were thinking.  Regards; Tuesday, August 10, 2004
