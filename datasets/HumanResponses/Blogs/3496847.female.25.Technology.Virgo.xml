       urlLink Television Without Pity   This is one of the best TV websites out there.  And I'm not saying that just because there are Canadians on staff.  Check out the recaps for "Joan of Arcadia."  Deborah is a goddess.

      Well, I didn't make it for a run this morning.  I have been stressed out this weekend and couldn't sleep last night, so I let myself sleep in.  I tried to go to a step class at lunch, but was so stressed that I started to have a panic attack.    I have learned lately that exercise does help me stress, but when I'm starting to breakdown it does not help.  I left the class and went to visit a friend at a nearby office.  I have not given up on running.  I will try again tomorrow.    Money is the main cause of my stress.   I work a boring office job, where I am well liked and therefore make the average salary.  This however is not enough to be comfortable in Toronto on my own, when I owe $30 000 in student loans.  I have $2000 charged on my Visa and I want to visit my parents in the Fall.  They live in another part of the country and are not able to help me financially.  My immediate goal is to pay off my Visa debts and not max it out again.  I would like to at least buy my plane ticket in cash.  I've given my Visa cards (there are 2, each with a thousand dollar limit) to my best friend.  She is hiding them in her underwear drawer at home until I show her statements with zero balances.  To be able to pay them with just my present income would take a year or more, and it's even harder when I keep sneaking small purchases onto them.  So, I've decided to look for part-time work.

      I started reading blogs a few months ago.  I check 4 of them almost daily and have been inspired to start one of my own.  I hope that by keeping a blog I will stick with running.  I have been running on and off for almost 10 years now.  A few times in high school I would decide that I need to lose weight, be healthier, or just get a hobby.  So I would try running.  It would only last for a few weeks, then I would quit.  Last October I joined a running group and stuck with it for 4 months, but I'm back to square one now.   Yesterday morning I dragged my bottom out of bed and went for a "run."  I was able to run a minute at a time, with one minute walking in between, 7 times.  It was a sunny, cool morning.    Tomorrow morning, before work, I will run.

      I'm taking Friday off of work to make it a four-day weekend.  It sucks that Canada Day is on a Thursday this year, but now that I'm off Friday I don't care.    I have a list of things I want to do this weekend:  Month-end laundry  - all my sheets and towels that have built up over the month  Crochetting  - finish the purple mittens for me, start Mum's Christmas present, maybe play with a few swatches  Blog some stuff I've been hanging on to   RELAX!

      This is the post I put on the  urlLink Cool Running  forum earlier.  I'm back baby!   1.) What week/day are you on?  W3D1  2.) Are you repeating a week?  This is my second time doing W3.  I finished it a week ago, but I got sick and wasn't able to move on to W4 right away.  I was barely able to get the energy to get out of bed to feed the cat so running was out of the question.  I'm feeling a lot better now and I've decided to repeat W3 and start W4 strong.  3.) How do you feel?  Since I hadn't run in 9 days and I'm still a newbie I figured today would be horrible.  I was paranoid that I'd have to go back to W2.  Luckily, I made it through today's run.  4.) Will you move on next week?  Yes  5.) Tell us your thoughts.  I'm just happy to be running.  6.) Are you taking extra time off to recover?   No, I'm not even that sore after the runs yet.

      Finally, weeks of listening to the politicians pick on each other.  Soon the government of Canada will have a new make up - all the new and returning MPs will head to Parliament, to pick on each other. I don't like the Canadian government.  I don't like the provincial government (Ontario or Nova Scotia.)  But I do vote.  There is no way that I'm not going to have my say.  I won't let others speak for me.  **I can't let Stephen Harper be our next PM.  If he got in and I didn't vote, I'd have to emigrate.  I couldn't complain about him and admit that I didn't do my part to try and keep him out of power.**   Issues that are important to me:   Health care  - free national health care is great.  Taxing the crap out of us for it sucks (Dalton McGuinty - I'm talking to you.  How dare you take $25 dollars a month more from me - I just get by as it is.  Don't you make enough off the interest I pay on student loans?)  Our health care is part of what makes Canada great.  It's lacking dental care.  Teeth are an important part of overall health.  I've never understood why it's not subsidized like other health services.  And we need more rural doctors.  I lived most of my life in NS without a primary care physician.   Education  - tuition in Canada is too high, and financial aid is not the answer.  I have a degree, and poor parents, therefore I have $30 000 in student loans to pay back.  Education makes our country better, but debt is making me consider (seriously) leaving the country.  If I'm going to be broke, why not be broke in an interesting setting?  Taxes  - we have some of the highest taxes in the G7.  Is it really necessary?  Are our taxes going where they are needed and promised to be going?  See the sponsorship scandal.  Drive on the highways and pay for gas. ****** I've voted - now it's time to watch the returns (and bake cookies.)

      As I continue to blog I will probably talk about my family - or complain about them.  Today I was talking to my Mum on the phone and realized we are very different (and she's a little odd.)    We could have a great run if we were on Broadway.  Here are the players: Mum - the one who raised me all by herself for 13 years (and did a bang-up job!) Dad - he's actually my stepdad, but he's the only one that counts little Bro - not really little, he's 23 now, just little to me Nannie and Papa - Mum's parents Two aunts - Mum's sisters One uncle - married to an aunt One almost uncle - in a long term relationship with the other aunt One cousin Assorted aunts, uncles and cousins on my Dad's side - I'll go more into that later Biological father's family - not major roles, we call him "Jo=Jo the sperm donor"

      I went to work today.  Except for a little nasal congestion (easily remedied with drugs) and exhaustion, I'm doing okay.    I'm going to hold off my return to running till the weekend.  I'd like to run Saturday and Sunday mornings.  I'm gonna use the rest of the work week to regain some strength.   I have a dentist appointment about my crown tomorrow.  That tooth still hurts when I chew anything hard, but we'll let the professional decide tomorrow.    [end of rant]

      I hate being sick.  I wasn't bad when I got up this morning, but by the time I got to work I was light-headed and dizzy.  I couldn't have even made it home on the subway then.    Symptoms:   sore throat  cough  tired  general ickiness  headache I ended up staying at work until 2pm.  I was on course last friday, so there was some work piled up from that and other stuff that had to be sone today.  As long as I kept busy and didn't move too much I was okay.    I took the streetcar from the subway station because it drops me off right infront of my building.  Normally I never bother with the streetcar, but I just wasn't up to walking the few blocks home.    A few friend's have had this codl too, and it's a bitch.  It seems to come and go - one day you feel okay then you feel like crap - for a about two weeks.  I'll 've had it for a week on Wednesday.     Too tired to continue bitching.....for now

      I'm enjoying morning running more than I thought I would.  I'm happier all day because I've done the hard (and satisfying) part of my day before I even go to work.  Before I even shower!  I feel lazy on the days I don't run.  Once my running is under control I'll do more crosstraining.  Running is enough *new* in my life.  I don't want to overdo it and give up on running or exercise again.  I want to make a lifestyle change and have a fun hobby.  Running works for me, but not if I go all gung-ho and wear myself out.  Then I just give up and go all lazy.    Since my runs have been getting more difficult, I've decided to break them down by day.  I'll still only post them once a week, but I'll talk seperately about each run and the week as a whole.   Day 1  - today's run was tough.  I had to stop for 15s at 2mins into the last 3min interval.  My calves were killing me, so I did a quick stretch.    Day 2  - better run today, but that last 3min interval was tough.  I read my watch wrong and stopped about 10s too early.  I made up for that by making the last running interval 2mins, not 90s.  I wanted to run until my watch beeped.  I set it for 20mins and count down the intervals from there.  There's a certain satisfaction in only stopping when the timer goes off.   My watch is a Timex  Rush .  It has an alarm, a stopwatch, and 10 pre-programmed timers (1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45mins and 1 hour.)  And the display is a good size.  I can read it with just a quick glance.  It's hard to read in low light, so I might replace it before winter (maybe with a Garmin Forerunner.)  I'd recommend it as a decent beginner's watch.  Okay - sorry for the sales pitch.  Day 3  - I din't make it through the whole run today.  It seems that I've caught a cold.  I'm going to take the weekend to recover.  If I'm not feeling absolutley dreadful on Monday I will try Week 3 again.  I'd like to be confident that I did a good Week 3 before I attempt Week 4.     Overall  - My legs were more sore this week.  It's my calves that kill me.  My quads and hamstrings seem okay, but I walk a lot and I go up at least 6 flights of stairs a day.

      Thoughts about staples:  **How long would it take me to use a whole box of 5000? **How many have I used in my life? - subtotal for staples I put in documents, subtotal for ones I've removed, subtotal for ones I've wasted **How many discarded staples live in carpets? **How much do all the staples in landfills weigh?

      People are surprised when they discover that I don't have cable television.  I'm not sure why.  Most everything I want to watch comes on antenna channels.  Anything else (Coupling, Six Feet Under) would require that I have a satellite dish.  I would need an American dish (slightly illegal) if I wanted BBC America & HBO - which I do.    The reception in Toronto is better than in Mississauga.  In Miss. I would have to move the antenna each time I changed the channel.  In TO there are only a couple of channels that I need to adjust for - one is the WB out of Buffalo.  The WB is bad reception because it's not being broadcast in Canada, TO just happens to be close enough to Buffalo that we can "eavesdrop" on their station.  And I did a few years at university without cable.  In NS you only get three english channels: CBC - which was too fuzzy to watch, Global and CTV - these two would *fuzz out* if a big truck drove by   I do watch my fair share of TV, though I watch less and less all the time.  I hate all those reality shows.  Even Canadian Idol (sorry Mum.)  And there haven't been any good new sitcoms in years.  Just crap.  Once I discovered "Joan of Arcadia" I never missed an episode - though sometimes I would set the VCR to tape it. I don't have a VCR since I got my own place all I have is a DVD player, so I'll miss some episodes in the fall.  I'll just have to read the recaps on TWoP then.     Here is what I try to watch on a regular basis:   Joan of Arcadia  - my theology degree pulled me in on this one.  I like seeing how the depict God without really tying it into (one) religion  The Simpsons  - but I don't worry if I miss a new one, they will be in syndication forever.  I'm sure there will be a 24/7 Simpsons channel  Gilmore Girls  - I just started watching last summer (a few repeats) and caught the new season.  After the season finale, I am officially hooked   Shows I will watch if I feel like watching TV and none of the above shows are on:   CSI, CSI spin-offs  - Miami is good for a laugh - I really dislike David Caruso and his character, but Rory Cochrane is kinda yummy; NY - I'm not gonna bother; Original - has gone downhill lately  Alias  - the first season was fantastic, the second season started out okay and then faded.  Was there a third season?  That's how boring the few episodes of S3 I saw were   Shows I download, but don't feel guilty about because I have paid them money in some way:   Coupling  - I own the first 3 seasons on DVD, and will buy the fourth once it becomes available.  I don't think season 4 has aired in Canada yet - it's not finished airing in the UK  Six Feet Under  - I rented the first season on DVD and will be renting the second season soon.  I haven't actually downloaded any episodes yet, but season 3 started recently, so I may  Gilmore Girls  - For the season finale the Canadian carrier (Global) was a week behind the US carrier (WB) because of a documentary they aired.  I couldn't make the WB watchable on the night they aired it so I downloaded it over the weekend (instead of waiting until Wednesday on Global) and watched in many times.  Then I watched it when Global aired it.  So I haven't really paid money for this show, but I only downloaded one episode and I am still subjected to their advertising when I do watch

      I frequent a website which features an advice column.  It's called  urlLink Tomato Nation , and the column is  urlLink The Vine .    Sars is the brilliant mastermind behind the site.  I love her column not because she's trained in any way to give advice, but because she tells people what they need to hear.  You don't need to take advice just because it's given, but I think she hits it dead on quite often.  In a recent column, the writer and her husband are having trouble because the wife in a couple they are friend's with discovered her online journal which had some not nice things about the friends in it.    I bring this up because this blog is not going to be a record of everything in my life.  I won't be discussing any details about my job, the company I work for, the people I work with, my friends or my personal life.  Co-workers may be mentioned - i.e. "a guy I work with recommended this book to me."  I may mention friends - i.e. "I visited my former roomate/best friend today.  We hung out, made brownies and watched movies."  It's not my place to reveal any personal information about people who aren't me.  I may let details about myself slip, but that's my choice.

      My bloody Internet is still not working properly.  Every time I disconnect or turn my comp off I have to fight to get connected again.  I unplug the modem, wait and reboot like the support guy suggested, but it doesn't always work.  I called my dad to see if he could help - he thinks that maybe something has come loose inside the tower. He thinks that when I moved to my new apartment it may have shaken something loose. I didn't tell him that I've moved the comp around in the apartment a few times as well. I'll call him later this week and have him walk me through doing it.  I was going to do it tonight, but there was a chance of a severe thunderstorm and it was pretty muggy. I will do it this week - I don't want to go another weekend without Internet if I don't have to.    Until I'm fully connected, blog entries will be sparse and the formatting issues will have to wait. And there isn't time to think up cute entry titles. I know the current font is big and ugly, but live with it. I also need to learn more HTML so I can spruce up the layout. So please, don't judge me (the blog) by my looks.

      I ran this morning - W3D1. I ran on the weekend, but I was in the park and there are so many large hills that I took more walk breaks than I should have. I'm counting it as a 'junk' run. Week 3 officially began this morning. It was a good run. I'm now running for 10.5 of the 20 minutes. I'm trying not to look too far ahead in the program. In a couple of weeks I will be running for 20mins with no break. For now I just need to get through each day.  I have been thinking about what to do after the C25K. I don't want to jump right into training for a race, because that was my downfall last time. My boss has suggested a 5k on July 16th, but I will barely be ready by then. I would rather build a solid foundation and start entering races next year.   Thoughts about after C25K: I will spend 6 weeks maintaining my base. That will be 30 minutes, 3 times per week. I will include one interval run or a hill run, and one long run each week.

      My Internet hasn't been working.  Last night I managed to get on for 2 minutes - just long enough to look up a phone number.  Today I got on for about 5 minutes.  I'm typing this into Notepad while I'm on hold with my ISP.  The lights are on on my modem, but it just keeps dialing and never connecting.  The recording says that their e-mail server is having trouble, but who knows.  My modem is only 6 weeks old - they sent me a new one when I moved.  I hope it's not fried.    Hip Hip Hooray - it's working again!  We don't know what was wrong, but I do know how to fix it.  Unplug power from the modem, shut the comp down and have another go.

      I went shopping this morning - bought some new clothes. I was tired of wearing the same things to work all the time. Plus the heat and humidity here are too much for me, and I need cooler clothing. I bought a dress, some capris, a few shirts and a new cardigan. I love a good cardigan, they're versatile, but a good one is hard to find. I'm not a big clothes horse, so black or navy blue is the way to go. Coloured cardigans don't match everything - I like a good mix-and-match wardrobe. I hate picking out what to wear in the morning, and for a girly, I'm not that fond of shopping for clothes.  My best friend and I went shopping on our lunch break yesterday. She just works down the street from me - close to the mall, so we met up. She needed a strapless bra for a cute outfit she bought to wear to a wedding today and I was looking for new sandals. She got a good bra, but it was in the "plus" section. She's a 38C. How is that a plus size? She's a size 10 in clothes - thin but not grossly skinny (i.e. Lara Flynn Boyle and Paris Hilton.) I can't believe what passes for sizing in clothes these days. I'm built about the same as her, but shorter - she's 5'9", I'm 5'6". We are not overweight.  Here is a break-down of the clothes I bought:  @ Reitman's Black & white capris - size 11 Gold Capris - size 10 (petite) Cute dress - size 9 2 t-shirts - size XL  @ RW (a subsidiary of Reitman's) Purple striped sleeveless top - size L  @ Jacob Black cardigan - size XL  @ The Running Room Dri-fit tank - size M  I can't just pick something up and hope it fits - there is no consistency. There should be a standard size chart for clothes sold in Canada. It could be North America; I don't really care. Just a standard of some kind. I don't care how the label it. There could be a scale for petite people (under 5'4" - that's right Ma, I'm not petite), hourglass figures, straight-shapes (no waist or hips - like me)....  I know there are too many different types of people for this to work, but I like to dream.

      Well, I made it through another week.  This morning's run was pretty tough.  I had a hard time making my feet and legs move.  I didn't think that I would make the last two intervals - there are  a lot  of hills in my neighbourhood.  And my mouth was very sore from some dental work I had done yesterday, so I was distracted.    No injuries to report.  Hardly any soreness either.  My calves and shins hurt last week, but they've gotten better this week.  I just keep thinking of how great it is to run 20 minutes or more without stopping.    I really like running Monday-Wednesday-Friday, so I'm going to try running tomorrow morning so don't end up Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday next week.  My plan was to go to High Park and run on the weekends, but they found a dead man there today, so I'm going to hold off on that for a bit.  They found him at 7:30 this morning in the northeast corner of the park.  I live near the east side, so I'm a  little  nervous.    Week 3 is run 90s, walk 90s, run 3min, walk 3min for 20min.

      So, of course, I love to talk about the weather.  The typical heat and humidity have begun in TO.  My a/c isn't installed yet, so I plunk in to a tub of cold water as soon as I get home.  Then I stand, wet and naked, in front of the fan.  Not to sound kinky, but that is what I do to beat the heat.    The weather is supposed to break tonight - which means thunder, lightning, and rain.  But then it should be nice for the next few days.  My friend's bf is a subcontractor, so he will install my a/c for me, but I have to wait till it's raining.  He works 6 days a week if it's nice out. ****** I run in the mornings now, so the weather hasn't hindered my training at all.  I'm starting to enjoy morning runs.  I can't eat before them, it would make me sick, so now I have fruit juice and water before I leave and gum along the way.  More juice and water when I get back, a shower, then brekkie.     **Handy training tip** Chewing gum helps keep your throat from getting dry - just don't choke on it

      I saw the new movie yesterday.  **You may not want to read this if you haven't seen the movie yet.**  I tend to go on the Net and read all the reviews of a movie after I see it - I hate knowing other people's opinions before I see a film.  I agree with the critics who have said that it is impressive visually, darker than the first two movies, and maybe a bit too scary for the younger children.  However, I found that too much was left out.  I am a fan of the books, but I do understand that they can't be translated to the big screen word-for-word.  In my opinion, there were two major points in the book that were left out of the movie.  The first makes the film it a bit confusing for anyone who isn't familiar with the book.  That would be the relationship between James Potter (Harry's dad), Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew.  I noticed it in the film when Harry is caught by Snape in the hallway at night.  Harry was using the Marauder's Map to follow Pettigrew.  Lupin saves Harry from the wrath of Snape and takes him back to his office.  Lupin knows that the blank piece of parchment Harry had on him was a map - he says so to Harry, but Harry never questions how he knew that.  Nor does Harry interogate him about Sirius or his dad.  I thought this was a serious oversight.  I was confused a bit, and I had re-read the book last week.  I also missed seeing the true Hagrid.  How happy he was to be able to teach a class, and how sad he was over the incident with Buckbeak.  He genuinely cares for the students.  The CGI creature was excellent, but it seemed out of place.  Without knowing what a good pet he was to Hagrid made that arc seem like a device just to allow Harry and Hermione to rescue Black.  I was glad to hear Hermione call the creature "Beaky" as they were leading him into the forest.  I do think there were parts of the movie that were very good:   I liked the scene in the boy's dorm where they are eating candy that makes them make animal noises.  It seemed like a realistic portrayl of 13-year old boys at boarding school. The chemistry between Ron and Hermione is progressing nicely.  It's very obvious in the fourth novel, but they are handling it well in the films. The Whomping Willow - because I hate birds too.  They sit outside my bedroom window, starting at the crack of dawn, torturing my cat.  She has to walk across me in bed to get to the window to meow at them.  I loved seeing the tree destroy the birds.  Quidditch - need more be said.  Always a good scene. The Dementors.  I avoided the previews because I didn't want to see them before I saw the movie.  I heard that they are similar to something in the Lord of the Rings films, but I don't know.  I was the first one and hated it, so I haven't watched the others.  The Dementors didn't look like they do in my mind, but they were very convincing.  I didn't expect to see them fly.  I saw them a gliding just above the ground.    You would never know that I was an adult - the way I go on about a children's film :) ****** Oh, I'm still running.  I did Week 2 Day 1 this morning.  I'm gong to run every second day.  I find it to be too hard to do two days in a row lately.  Too many stairs in my building.  Whoever said a four-floor walk-up is cute should be shot - Opps, that was me.  Must go play with the cat so she lets me sleep tonight.  Ciao.

      I need to go to the grocery/drug store soon.  I'm low on toilet paper, kitty litter and  feminine products  (known as  goodies  while I was growing up.)    I'm going to split it up and buy the items over the next couple of trips out.  It seems a little odd to buy those three items at once.  It's quite the combination.

      I finished Week 1:Day 3 today.  Out the door at 7:30 - I headed straight down the street and didn't turn around until the last running interval (I run 60s and walk 90s for 20 mins.)  This left me with a 20 minute walk back home, but it is beautiful out so I didn't mind.    The running went really well this week.  No sign of my shin splints, and the runs haven't been very difficult to complete.  I'm optimistic for the next week, which I will start tomorrow.  Week 2 is run 90s and walk 2mins for 20mins.

      Three months ago I chipped a filling, while eating scrambled eggs, and had to have it replaced.  That was $260 - luckily, I have insurance.  I grind my teeth in my sleep, so the filling was weakened by that.  Now that same tooth is fractured and I need a crown.  That will be $950 and is not covered under my basic dental plan.  I did take out $500 worth of elective coverage, but I will need a nightguard ($230)to keep me from damaging the crown (or other teeth.)    I know I'm lucky to have a dental plan, but I will still be paying over $600 out of my own pocket (a.k.a. Visa, and that is going to hurt until I find a second job.  Back to my point - there is big money in dentistry.  If you like people being afraid of you and you aren't grossed out easily I say think of dentistry as a career.

      Well, I made it out for a run again this morning.    I'm using the  urlLink Cool Running  Couch to 5K program.  It's a great program.  Easy to follow - even with a cheap little stopwatch.  There are a few runs that are challenging, but you feel great once you're done.  I've made it to week 6 or 7 on a few occasions, but I tend to give up then.   But I will not give up this time!     Cool Running also has a great forum - great people to help keep you motivated.  Some are new runners and some a veterans.  A great place to visit if you're thinking of starting running.  I have a cat and while I was trying to type this entry she caught a fly in my bedroom.  I was a little grossed out when she tried to eat it on my bed.  I managed to shoo her off the bed, but then she was carrying the fly, in her mouth, around my apartment - and it was still buzzing.  I'm so glad she's an indoor cat.  I would hate to have her bring mice and birds in the house.    Well, I'm off to mentally prepare for a Friday at the office.  I like Friday as much as the next 9-to-5'er, but do we all have to go around on Fridays saying, "Thank G*d it's Friday."  The same goes for cursing Mondays.

      ...but there was lightning and thunder here, so I unplugged my computer for the night.    Well, I made it out for a run this morning at 6am.  It was a nice morning for a run.  I was surprised that I only saw one other person running.  There were a few early morning commuters waiting at streetcar stops and coffee shops.    I’m trying to be healthier, and sleep is an important part of health.  I strive to go to sleep around 10pm and wake at 6am on days I want to run (10:30-6:30 on off days.)  Sometimes I find it hard to turn my brain off and I lie in bed thinking.  On top of that, I live on a busy street and my apartment is a few floors up, right on the street.  There are streetcars until the wee hours and garbage pick up twice a week around midnight.  I can’t always hear the television if a streetcar goes by, so I’ve learned to watch it with the closed captioning on.

      My Internet is busted.&nbsp; The ethernet card is not working - it's either busted or not connected properly anymore.&nbsp; Since I'm a little low on cash lately, I've decided to do without the Net at home for a few months.&nbsp; It might be 3-6 months before I get it back, so my posts will only be once a week or so.&nbsp; I'm at a café right now.  Running is still going - but I'm stuck at Week 3.&nbsp; I will move on next week, but I may repeat it once or twice.&nbsp; I'm happy going slowly.&nbsp; I'd hate to be sidelined by an injury again.

      My kitty is an excellent hunter.  She catches any bug the dares to enter my apartment.  I've lost count of how many flies she has caught (and subsequently eaten.)  She chases them all over the apartment until she wears them out.  They seem to be perfectly healthy when they are buzzing around.  They're not the half-dead, tired flies that you sometimes see.  Now, if she would stop taking them to my bed and eating them over my duvet.

      I had trouble sleeping the other night.  Every half hour, from 10:30pm till after 1am, I would wake up because I was dreaming that the world was ending.  It was like the film "Last Night" where you know that the world is ending, and have known for sometime.  It was down to the final few hours, and you knew you were done for, but you had no idea how it would happen - disease, fire, pain, suffering??  I think that I would be one of the panicked people in an end-of-the-world situation.  Or I would become catatonic, living in a hole I dug in the backyard.  I've always been able to remember my dreams well.  I've also always suffered from nightmares every so often.   Oh, if you haven't seen  urlLink Last Night  then go rent it.   Now.   It's one of the better Armageddon films around.  Each time I watch it I am fascinated a little more and have more questions about one story line.

      I re-did Week 3, and it went pretty well.   On to Week 4 tomorrow.  W4 is a little scary, but I've done it before.    It's 3 days of: Run - 3mins Walk - 1.5mins Run - 5mins Walk - 2.5 mins **do this twice, for a total of 24mins**  5mins seems like a long time, but a few weeks ago I could barely squeeze out anything over a minute.  I really like getting my run in in the morning, it makes my whole day better.  No matter how little I accomplish during the rest of the day, at least I ran.

      I'm not sure why I've taken up so many hobbies lately.  Running, blogging, crocheting and now learning French.  I think normal people do more hobby-stuff in the winter, but I've never claimed to be normal.   Running keeps my stress-levels down, makes me healthier, and keeps me from getting too chubby.  Blogging gets all of this useless crap that you're reading out of my head.  Crocheting lets me watch all the TV and movies I want without feeling lazy.  French is a language I've been learning on and off for years.  Aside from the 45mins a day they tried to teach us in school, I've done a year immersion in junior high (at an English school) and have taken evening classes.   One of my French co-workers is giving some instruction one lunch hour a week and I'm listening to audio lessons everyday and studying.  I'm also going to start watching some French TV.

      I have not had any luck this weekend.    Wednesday, just before 5, I got my finger caught in the safe at work.  It hurt - a lot.  I'm still surprised that I didn't cry and/or curse.  I have a pretty high tolerence for pain.  I'll make a show of it, curse and complain, but I can handle it pretty well.  I've broken bones and had things pierced and been okay.    So I got my finger jammed, freed it and ran to the kitchen to put it in cold water.  Under the nail had turned pruple immediately.  A co-worker ran and got me ice.  It wasn't broken so I went home, taking the ice pack on the subway with me.  I woke up Thursday and it hurt more.  It was swollen, the purple under the nail had expanded and turned black.  I spent Thursday in pain, and advil wasn't doing anything.  Friday my finger was even worse.  It throbbed.  I had to keep it elevated and if anything touched it I was near tears.  I went to the dentist for impressions of my crown.  The freezing wore off before he was done working.  More pain, just what I needed.  I then visited a friend, walked around TO to try and get my mind off my finger and picked up a few things at Wal-mart.  I walked from the Eaton Centre to Bay & Bloor and then around the U of T campus for a bit.  My mind never forgot about my finger and then I was tired and cranky.  I took a cab home from Wal-mart.  I tried to change my clothes once I was home and when I was taking off my shirt it touched my finger and it hurt - I was in tears and had to sit down.    So I went to the clinic.  I knew what had to be done to get rid of the pain, but it didn't sound like fun.  The doctor needed to drill a hole in my nail and let it bleed to relieve the pressure.  He held my hand down - I was lying down thank goodness, held my finger tight (pain) and started to dig a little whole with a needle (more pain).  He got through the nail (lots and lots of pain) and started to squeeze my finger to force the blood out (pain).  After about two squeezes I could feel the pressure letting up.  He spent about five minutes squeezing my finger.  He kept saying that I should of come in sooner, and that this is a terrible pain to endure for two days.  If the pressure comes back then I hould go to a clinic right away.  I promised I would - and I will if necessary, it hurt while he was doing it, but I'm much better today then I was yesterday.    My finger hurt all night from the squeezing, but I slept like a log and woke up in less pain.  Typing hurts, so that's it for now.
