      Bleh. I'm so bored right now. I've just finished Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Goldman. It's a really good book. I'd recommend it to a friend of mine, Christina, and she said it was fabulous. Yup... I have to go to tutoring tomorrow. I don;t want to go. Ugh! I hate trigonometry! I still have to figure out how livejournal works, meaning all the customizing. I don't think it'll take to long for me to figure it out but I'm to lazy. :@ Anyways I have to go now.

      This week has been crawling by so slowly. I'm glad its over. I volunteered for Franklin's Elementary School's sports day with Christina and Casey. I didn't have that good of a time but it definitely beats going to school. I have an english presentation today, but because of this Mrs. Bird allowed me to present on Wednesday. Their sports day ended at 12. I went to Casey's house for a while then we decided to go to the mall. I needed to buy Maggie a birthday present. We went to Bretwood but soon afterwards we got bored (Brentwood is not big) so we decided to go to Lougheed mall , which was about ten minutes away. We shopped for a bit then went to Metrotown (another mall). I was quite funny because we went from one mall to another. In the end I found this skirt for Maggie at the Garage Clothing. I hope she likes it.

      w00t! Summer break is finally here. Last day of school today! Ahh! First block was socials, our class watched Monster Inc. That is a good movie! Boo is so cute. Anyhoo, we had a sub for math and he gave me permission to go to Mr. Kuniss' class, who were 'watching' a movie. Carmen, Casey and I went out for Mortadella (sp?) subs for lunch. (courtesy of Carmen) After lunch I had mandarin. Mandarin was so boring, all we did was sitting in our seats for an hour with nothing to do. A chinese movie was on but I had no idea what it was about. For PE, Mr. Reagh took us out for slurpees and ice cream from DQ. Hehehe. He dismissed us after we got our treats because he said we weren't gonna do anything, anyways. Everybody had water ballons and water guns. A lot of people got wet after school. :P A bunch of my friends wanted to go to the beach to tan but I didn't feel like going so I came home. Yup. That's my exciting day. Anyways, I was watching the special encore of North Shore and it's.. interesting. I think the OC is better though. But the blonde lifeguard in the North Shore is hot! His character name is Gabriel. His actual name is Corey Sevier. So hot!!

      I had a very good day today. Lol. It's been a while since I'm in a pleasant mood. With exams, homeoworks, school, parents, friends and all that shit; I've been feeling pretty stressed out and lately I've been feeling a bit depressed. I don't think its anything serious, but I just feel sad or... unhappy, for lack of a better word.   Anyways, I had a very good day today. I had graphic first block and our teacher gave us free block. So I went on the net for the whole hour. (Friday classes are only an hour each) I had science next and we had a quiz which was alright. I think I did okay on it. Took some notes afterward. I have a science exam on Thursday so I really have to study. I'm gonna go to Joana's house on Sunday to 'study', but I have a feeling we're gonna get sidetracked. -coughprocratinatingcough- Well, I had English afterwards and we did nothing. Really. Foods was next and we did a worksheet on milk. So exciting eh? When we got off school I went to Christina's house with Casey, Jing Xi and Peter. Jing Xi was going to bring Chicago, but it turns out that it was a tape and Christina could only play DVDs. So we decided to go to Peter's house, which was only about five/six blocks away. We watched half of it and then we had to leave cause Peter had a job interview. Jing Xi and Christina went home. Casey and I went to HDC. We stayed there for a bit then we went home cause we got bored.   It doesn't sound all that great (my day). But for some unexplainable reason I'm in a good mood. Meh. Go figures. I hope it keeps up.

      I'm in graphic class right now, bored out of my mind. Our graphic teacher, Mrs. Taylor isn't here and we have a subsitute. Our assignment today was to go to photoshopcafe.com and find a text tutorial we had to follow. Rather simple. Phtt. I have an english exam later today, hope I do well. One and a half week of school left and everyday is crawling by so slowly. For some unexplainable reason, I'm feeling a little irked. I don't know why. Maybe it's because of the fact that it's early in the morning (not really..) or maybe because of lack of sleep, or simply because of the facty that I'm PMSing. I don't know. I'm feeling so anit social right now. Like, I just don't want to be around people. I think I'm about to say something very rude/inconsiderate/stupid. ERRGH! This suck. I just wanna go home!!

      Saturday. Bleh. I don't have anywhere to go. Well yesterday was Hastings Sports Day. Me and a couple of my friends volunteered to help out. It was alright. We got off at one but we stayed for a little longer because we were trying to decide what/where to go next. We were going to watch Harry Potter and POA, but then we thought there was going to be to many people so yeah.. We (me, Casey, Parson, Stephanie, Ming, Kevin T) decided to go to Parson's house since he lived so near. When we got there, we played Mario Party, but then we got bored so we decided to race (Mario Kart). Dennis, William and Kevin H showed up. We played for a little longer and then we watched Cheaper By the Dozen. It was pretty boring and not funny. Half way through we got hungry and decide to go out and eat. After we ate, Casey, Dennis, Kevin H, and William decided to go to HDC. I didn't want to go so I came home. So exciting eh? Anyhoo, hopefully I'll get out today. I have two exams this week so I have to review my notes. Ciao.

      I went to the mall with Betty, Stephanie, Dennis, Casey, Kelly and Kevin today. I didn't get anything. We watched a movie though. We couldn't decide what to watch so Betty and I watched Spider-man 2 while the others watched Anchorman (sp?). Kevin, Casey and Kelly already watched Spider-man 2 and they weren't willing to watch it a second. Stephanie didn't want to watch it and I don't think Dennis cared. Well, I thought the movie was pretty good. It was awfully long though. I'll probably watch the third one when it comes out. Betty and I went into the theatre half an hour early and there were already a lot of people sitting there already. We managed to get good seats. When the movie started, the theatre was packed.   Afterwards, we met the others up at Playdium. Soon everyone left so Betty and I went over to Steph's house. When we got there, we called Chris and Dennis over. Yoshi was suppose to come but he didn't show up. We order A LOT of food. We thought Yoshi was coming so yeah. We bought two large pizzas, ten pieces of chicken, a box of fries and some potato salad. Yeah.. I only had three slices of pizzas and I was stuffed. We watched [i]Finding Nemo[/i] while eating. I can't believe Dennis hasn't watched it yet. Crazy.. I love that movie. Dory is hilarious! Hahah.

      Stephanie is back from Florida today. She went to Disneyland and she also went on a cruise with her family. She called me when she got back and invited me over to her house. It's a good thing she called me at one-ish because I just got home from summer school fifteen minutes ago. Anyways, we: Betty, Maggie and I, were looking at all the pictures she took. She had an awesome time and I wish I was going on a cruise. :(    Well, we watched a movie afterwards. Anna and the King. Steph said it was a good movie and since Maggie and I never watched it before. Tom Felton is in that movie. He was so cute. Haha. The movie itself was alright.    Oh! Steph got us all a sovenier. I got a candle. -Nodds- It's pretty. It's the gel kind and its a clear blue at the top that fades. On the bottom is about two inches of sand. On top of the sand is scattered with shells and colourful pebbles. It looks wicked!

      Bleh. I woke up at seven in to morning to get ready for summer school. (I registered for a math 10 preview course) I met Casey and Kelly at the bus stop on Dundas and Nanamio at 9:45. The bus came about five minutes later. When we got to VanTech it was still very early. The people who signed up for classes at the 8:00 block were dismissed when we got there, so we saw a lot of people. Jonathan, Sean, Carlos, Anita, Jamie, Shana. There were so many people there. When the class finally began, we took a little bit if notes and solved problems and answers questions. It was SO boring. I guess today was for review because everything we did seemed to be a review for me. The questions were all very easy. Casey and Kelly wanted to go to Metrotown afterwards, but I didn't bring any money and I didn't really feel like going considering the fact that I just went to the mall on Sunday. Did I mention that I'm also broke. So many birthdays are coming up and the gifts are going to set me back quite a bit. Phft. Plus, I don't know what to buy the people with the upcoming birthdays.    Well anyways, we all decided to go home. Diana and dad were out for lunch so I was home alone. (Mum was at work) I washed my hair and watched so tv for about ten minutes. There's absolutely nothing good on during the day. All soap operas and daytime talk shows.   Amazing Race is started again. Its on today. I love that show. Well, Diana needs to use to computer now.
