      Today I went to L.A. with some friends. No real purpose aside from checking out all the beautiful women. I mean can you really blame us? It was a nice break from the homework and what not that has kept be busy for the better part of the last three months. I have to take my finals next week and I will spend most of this holiday weekend working on my last reports and readings. Thats about it...but let it be know, I love L.A.!!!

      I have to drive about 80 miles three days a week to get to class but because I live in Southern California traffic is a pain in the ass. So what do I do, I leave at 4am for a 745am class. I get to Santa Monica about 515am and just sorta hang out until class starts.  Under normal circumstances I wouldn't go to school so far but I was already going there when my roomate and I had a falling out-I could win a worst roommate contest hands down-and thus I moved into my mothers house in Riverside and I haven't found a place to stay yet. Soon, maybe over the summer break I will get a place and in the fall I wont have to dive so freaking much. Gas is $2.60/gallon for premium. Its adds up.

      D-Day! Can one even begin to imagine what it was like on that day? As I watched the memorial service on TV this morning of President Bush adresssing the survivors and liberators I began to think what an insurmountable debt I owe them. I also am saddened about the death of former President Regan as well. It has been 60 years since D-Day and I wonder how few of those great men will return in the following years. Their contribution to our society is one that none of us will ever be able to fully understand nor repay. President Regan likewise signaled a shift in the direction of American culture and brought us back from a cycle of self-pitty and anger that could have destroyed everything we are. So it is that with his passing I reflect on his philosophies and gain a better understanding of what is in the future. Major chapters in world history are closing as then men and women who lived through them began to finish their time with us and for many of us comming of age today new chapters are being written by us. Let us remember the lessons learned, honor the past and pray that we might be noble as they.
