      Man if I keep posting Ill have some sort of bizare high standard to live up to.  Listening to the "90's" channel on Launchcast Radio. MMMMMmmmmm Nostalgia. Its bizarre how that actually calms me down.  Maybe its just because it reminds me of when I didnt have to worry about shit.  Except getting cig's and having the money to pitch in for pizza when we gamed.  I miss those days in a wierd way. Now I have a million and one things that I have to concentrate on.  I always feel like im jumping through one hoop or another. As tolkien put it "I feel thin, like butter scraped over to much toast." Not all the time but enough that it is nice to sit and listen to silly 90's music and just forget all the crap going on.  I hesitate to even make a fucking list because it might be to overwhelming sometimes. I wish I had the stick-to-it-edness that my dad has had for years.  Somehow he finds the energy to come home and continue working untill he goes to bed.  Even though his job is a manual labor job, which i would imagine he would want to come home and crash from. I just feel that sometimes I am being pulled in umpteen directions all at once.  And the fact that several people in my house have the TV on constanlty doesnt help.  For some reason I am  sucked into the TV like a moth to the flame.  Even if its some crappy ass show that I dont like.  Its kind of odd actually.  And with cable there is always something at least moderately mediocre on that can drone away.   Given the choice I would take the radio over TV in a heartbeat.  I can sit and do nothing and listen to it.  Or it can be the background as I do work (like at my job).  It gives me something to kind of putter about to.

      I hate finances! With a passion! I am trying to work on getting some sort of a balanced budget but shit allways fucks up.  This month both me and my wife (in an effort to catch up bills) scheduled a HUGE payment from 2 different companies.  Both on the same day.  And neither of us told each other.   So now we have to play the dollar juggling game (not nearly as fun as the name may sound on its own).  I think we should be able to do it but im going to have to remove the money needed for gas in the car before anything else comes out of this check.  We cancelled our gym membership that was costing 55 a month.  It was just wasted money since neither of us ever went.  I think i have been a total of ... 5 times since we started it almost 2 yrs ago.  Lisa may have been there 8.   At least that will be out of the way.  And Gen Con is going to be paying me as a contractor soon for moderating their forums and being the "indy contact" with my friend Spicer.  So that should help a bit anyways.  I think my wife is going to try to do some massages (massage therapist) and make a little extra money. Hopefully she can get a few clients to help us out.  We are in the process of looking for a new car still.  Even though we dont exactly know whats going on with the ins. co.'s about the accident.  We cant wait forever! We have pretty much decided to go for the Buick Century.  It is a bigger sedan.  Considered "full size", which we need.  Especially since I dont anticipate that Rune will be our only child.    *more later*
