      Alright Y'all.This is just something that has been bothering me,and I was just wondering if anybody felt the same. Right now,the finals are on.The Lakers and the Pistons.I ain't watching it,I don't like basketball that much,but my dad is.And the thing I would like to know is if anybody shares my dad's opinion of the lakers.His opinion of them is this:  1.Big 5oo(his nickname for Shaq,Diesel Truck and 400 Pounder are some others)should take his big behind back to Orlando  2.Carl Malone and Gary Payton have no business being in LA. Period.Why did they go to a team that is already good.Why not go to a team that needs some help?I told him that they want rings."Yeah,but Jordan didn't so that".He says."Jordan carried the whole team on his back to victory.His team was sorry,but he stuck it out with them.And when he cam back from retirement the second time,he didm't go to the Lakers,he sure could have,but he went to the Wizards."  3.To see a team that loaded messes the game up.As far as he's concerned,the Lakers should be shut down after this season.He can't stand to see them win.Now,i don't know if he relly meant that,but he was mad that the Timberwovles didn't stop them from going to the finals.  4.He says that Fisher is a good actor,because nobody pushed him hard enough to fall on the floor like that.  5.He says that he wants to see tears in Fisher's eyes this year,like he did last year when they lost to the Spurs.  I think it's hilarious.My dad is crazy.I tell him that it's not that serious,but he still persists in yelling at the T.V.

      Since it's Monday,it's time for some more songs of the week.This week I have two"  New Edition-Hot 2 nite. I am reall y excited for New Edition.They're getting back into the mix.The song is not my favorite,but it's pretty good.Some of those kind of groups don't really do good when they come back after a long time.But I think from hearing this song,that they have some potential.  Lo-Key-I got a thang 4 ya.Another one of those old songs.I heard it on the Adelphia cable R&amp;B channel.Yeah,its old,but it's good.

       Today,I had my dreaded dentist apopointment.I hate going to the dentist.First of all,it is  uncomfortable.To me it feels like an extreme violation of my personal space.I had to get two stupid cavaties filled.I don't even know why i had cavaties.I brush my teeth everday.I guess I need to floss more...And if the cavaties weren't enough,my front tooth was a little chipped so they had to file it down to match my other one.That alone took like 20 minutes.And to do all this,they had to numb my whole mouth.And let me tell you,I am not enjoying it.My mouth is still numb, two hours later.And I feel retarded when I talk because it feels like only one side of my mouth is moving.Maybe only one side of my mouth  is  moving,and I  do  look retarded.I don't know.All I know is that when I ate my hot dog,only half of my mouth tasted it.And I had to be careful when I drank my iced tea,so that it didn't dribble out of my mouth.Man,I must look pretty dumb.

         I like this quote:      "What's bizarre? I mean we're all pretty bizarre! Some of us are just better at hiding   it, that's all." -Andy,from The Breakfast Club        Isn't that a good one?It kinda puts everyone in the same boat when it comes to being weird.

         So I decided that it would be good to start typing down the songs I'm feelin for the week down.For this week or for the time being it's:  1.Welcome Back-Mase,I'm anxious to see what this brother is going to do next.Whether or not he's going to keep his songs clean.And positive.I would hope so,with all his preacher,"I'm saved"business.I think it would be real good if he put out some songs, good songs,that send a positive message.I mean let's talk about something else besides girls,and their big booties(and that's putting it in a nice way) for once.Like Kanye.I like what he's doing with 'Jesus Walks'.That song is pretty hot.And all right i can give some daps to Jadakiss.With 'Why'.But all his stuff ain't like that.And neither is Kanye's.I think rappers got a lot of influence,and they should use it for some more positive good stuff.  2.My Place-Nelly.Now I like this song.Way better then his other one,Get you eagle on,flap your wings,or whatever it's called.All I have to say is that this is the song.Something's telling me it's gonna get played out like his Dillema did.Man they played that song so much i got sick of it.They do that with a lot of songs,but that's the way it goes,I guess.  3.The Grease theme song.I'm weird like that.I like old songs.My friends are always questioning my music taste.But this is the song,for real.I watched Grease this morning,for lack of having anything better to do,and heard the song,and i was like dang,I have to look this song up off a Window's media player,or download it.And that's what i'm feelin at the moment.
