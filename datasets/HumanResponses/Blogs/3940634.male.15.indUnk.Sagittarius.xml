       Well I just feeling like putting some thoughts on paper(or type them on something)   Wade is still as dumb as ever when it comes to drinking, Zach is being the annoying little brother, Cara is being herself, Quickly annoied by little things, and emotional, Natasha is herself, annoying, I feel like the only normal person in the family, but I am far from normal....but oh well, I just have to sit around and take it

      Hi to the two or three people that read this,    I will start by writing my life story   I'm from Canada I was in school for 2 year's then my mother took me out and home schooled me, and while I was being home school I was taking karate, I might be doing it again this semptember but I'm not sure if I want to, anyways, So once I got far enough into home schooling I started teaching myself, so now I'm self tought :),  I had to go to this program when I was 13 called Maraposa (or something like that) for my spelling and reading.    Now outside of school    I asked one of my oldest friends out when I was 13 just to be rejected, I sunk into depression I think...I wanted to kill myself, I got over her I think it was 7 months after, but I still couldn't find the will to live, the only reason I wouldn't kill myself was because of my mother and because I knew my older sister would too, so I just couldn't. Now I'm happy cause I found Christ :)  I have only a few friends and only one I still hang out with cause he is only like 10 minutes away, so I have like no social life, I love computer, I'm going to be building my own when I get the money, right now I'm looking for a job...Anyways that pretty much my past.    This weekend from the 8th to the 14th I went to a Catholic retreat called Steubenville East at some shrine that isn't even in Stuebenville(Someone wasn't to bright)   On the trip there I met this girl Rhiannon, I think I love her but she lives 40 minutes away and has a boyfriend named Zack, I think she likes me(she flirted enough) but we won't be going out cause of Zack, and I don't want her to break up with him for me, but I don't want to wait for them to break up,  It's really confusing, so I think I will just try to get over her.   While I was at the Shrine, I found out how much I need Jesus in my life, Saturday night I gave my life to God and at the adoration right after the Spirit touched me, now I'm not as easily angered, and when something sad is around me, I'm at peace and I feel like helping(I have before, but not the in same way) instead of breaking down because everyone is...it's kinda hard to explan, as for what I felt durring adorasion...I can't explan it, it was the most wonderful thing ever.   Well, That pretty much everything, I will write in my blog more
