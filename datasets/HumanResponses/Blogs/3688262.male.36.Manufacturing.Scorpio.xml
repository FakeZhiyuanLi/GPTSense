      Many of the great men of our country's history have held the title of General.  Everybody knows about Washington in the Revolution, He was after all the "father" of our country.  There was "IKE" who led one of the great coalitions of all time, and also ascended to the Presidency.  There was Westmoreland known mostly for the disaster that was Vietnam.  He simply wouldn't let the soldiers fight the way they needed to win.  And then you come to some for their more modern achievements.    Colin Powell, one of the great military officers of our time, was a three star general who was leaped over dozens of his colleagues to become the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest ranking man in the military.  He is now Secretary Powell of the Department of State.  And of course serving with him we had "Stormin" Norman Schwarzkopf, who absolutely destroyed the Iraqi Army in practically no time.  He performed one of the greatest "left hooks" in history.  Obviously a hard man, and by most counts, not someone whom one wanted to report bad news to, Schwarzkopf nonetheless had the respect of the people he led but he also had something more important.  The enemy feared him.  When he got on tv and said we're gonna do this and that, the Iraqis were shitting tiffany bricks because they thought it was the gospel.   Before the invasion of Panama, a man named General Fred Woerner was in charge of SOUTHCOM( all Army stuff south of Texas ).  When he was told of the senior Bush administrations plan to invade Panama, and clean that mess up, General Woerner really wasn't all that excited with the idea.  Well a decision had been made by the President, and that should be the end of it.  President Bush Sr. was so upset with the General, that he chose the retiring General Max Thurman to replace General Woerner.  This was exactly the right thing to do.  President Bush brought someone else on board who was more in line with the plan and able to execute same with a clear conscience.  Our current President could take a lesson well learned from his father on this one.  It is time to replace the entire senior leadership in Iraq, as well as the CINC of the Central Command.  They simply are not getting the job done.  Remember, these are the same guys who are in charge of Afghanistan at the same time they are trying to deal with Iraq.  For a mission this big, you need a personality who can shoulder such a load.  I am sorry to say that while the current leadership is certainly honorable, it simply is not effective.  Our troops deserve better from their Generals.   Arrick

      Once again the al-Qaida have struck and shown their devious genius at the same time.  Five attacks, almost simultaneously, show again that this is a highly organized, supremely motivated group of terrorists.  The fact that the attacks happened in such a coordinated manner suggests that the leadership of this group is maybe much smarter in a tactical sense than they have been credited for.  The bold and daring attack shows also that we still haven't had the effect on disrupting their operations that we simply must have if we intend to stop this madness.  We have to go offensive, and stop standing around waiting for them to do something else for us to react to.  It has always been a bad thing in warfare to give the initiative over to the enemy.  They have the initiative now, at least for the time being.  And the sad thing is they just took it right away.  Remember folks, this is the same bunch of shits who completely changed the election results in Spain just months ago.  They think they can stop the new government in Iraq, they think they will win Saudi Arabia, and they think they will win here in November as well.  Any one who believes they will stop at nothing had better wake up.  Arrick

      And so it continues.  The al-Qaida have now beheaded a third foreigner, a man from South Korea no less.  How do they think this is going to help their cause?  Do they really believe that if they keep cutting people's heads off, and posting it on the internet, that all of a sudden world opinion is going to rally around them?  These people are extremists in the absolute sense of the word.  They think they are going to have total Islamic control of the world and that they are doing absolutely right.  There is only one way that has proven proper down through history to deal with such people.  Total annihilation.  Completely wipe them out.  Just days after the disastrous 911,  Vice President Cheney brought up an idea of having "hunter-killer" teams established by the CIA and the American Special Forces Community.  The sole purpose of these teams would be to track and hunt down terrorists cells worldwide, and eliminate them.  The idea was rejected by several other members of the Administration as to extreme a reaction.  I could not disagree more.  I think the VP had it absolutely right the first time.  I think the development and deployment of such hunter-killer teams in desolate places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Phillipines  and probably dozens of other places would be a fantastic way to take the offensive against this continuing worldwide threat.  I wonder how many heads would continue to be cut off if the full power and might of The United States military and intelligence establishment were fully unleashed?  How much more shit are we going to tolerate from these people before we decide there has to be a better way of dealing with it?  Arrick

      Man did they blow this one!  The Court did what it has been famous for doing for two centuries.  They simply dodged the entire thing.  The man who brought the dispute is in a custody battle with his ex-wife, so the Court said he didn't have standing to bring the case to begin with.  The Court has a long and storied history of doing just this.  Dodging politically flammable objects by just blowing them off on a technicality.  What i didn't hear anyone ask was this.  So the man involved is in a custody dispute.  If the girl is still his daughter, then why doesn't he have standing to bring this suit?  Now don't get me wrong folks.  I think this guy is completely full of shit and he is only making a case out of this to get his fifteen minutes.  But having said that, he should certainly have the right to defend his daughter, especially if he is going through the judicial system the proper way.    To the heart of the matter now.  The Pledge of Allegiance is NOT a prayer.  It has no bearing whatsoever as to the mixing of religion and government.  It is simply a patriotic "ceremony", and a very pleasant way to start a day or begin some special event with.  If you don't want to say it along with the rest of us, fine.  That is also your right to do so.  But don't expect the rest of us to capitulate to your obvious state of being out of touch.  America is a great country and this is just one way for the citizenry to show that.  Arrick

      Are we ever going to learn from our pettiness?  Secretary Ridge over at Homeland Security asked last year to change the name of the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to Bureau of Investigations and Criminal Enforcement.  This has apparently gotten a lot of panties in a wad over at the FBI.  In their minds, they simply can not allow another federal law enforcement agency to have the name "Investigation" in it.  Does this sound like the kind of bullshit that the Secretary for Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the FBI Director should be wasting a lot of time on?  It sounds to me like the same kind of crap that was going on when people in the field were trying to get the leadership to listen and stop the worst attack in American history.  You people are supposed to be the best and brightest.  It seems that all of the lessons supposedly learned since 911, (better communication among government agencies) has passed the three of you right on by.  Shame on you for wasting time on something so petty.  Settle this, and get back to the people's business.  If you guys aren't paying attention to what's going on out there, then who is?  Im very sorry to say that it certainly doesn't sound to me like we have reached that spirit of interagency cooperation that is so vital for our success in the war against terrorism.

      Are you kidding me?  The commission has decided in its infinite wisdom that it would like to reinterview Vice-President Cheney after he stated he "possibly" had seen more intelligence information than the commission had.  OF COURSE he's seen more information.  He's the Vice-President.  Not to mention his varied services over the years to the federal government. (Including SecDef)  Mr. Cheney is a voracious reader and the government can generate some paper my friends.  He has probably had access to and read 1000's of documents that will never see the light of day.  Does anyone believe Mr. Cheney is going to march back to the commission and spill his guts?  Wake up people.  The Administration is adamant in it's assessment of the fact there was a relationship between Iraq's regime and the al-Qaida terrorist network.  I think in time they will be proven correct.  I believe the Administration is in possession of intelligence so secret, that it's leaking out would probably get real people killed.  How else to explain the Administration's position.  Even after the public pronouncement by the commission that there was no connection, both the President and VP stated differently almost immediately.  I do not believe this was done to win an election in November.  I think they know something that the rest of us don't yet.  There are times folks, WHEN IT DOES MAKE SENSE FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO KEEP SOME THINGS SECRET!!!  I believe this to be one of those times.   Arrick

      I have viewed photos of recently murdered Mr. Johnson in Saudi Arabia.  I also saw the photos of the murderous beheading of Mr. Berg in Iraq.  This is the face of the enemy people.  These people will never stop.  They themselves arent even sure what their endgame is supposed to be.  It is time once and for all to finish it.  Yes that's right.  Simply finish it.  Will we kill a bunch of innocent people in the process.  Probably.  Will we accidentally hit the wrong buildings or injure totally innocent people.  Yes Im afraid we will.  But that being said, it is simply time to finish it.  Wipe them out entirely?  Well I guess in the real world in which we all reside, that is  an impossibility.  But we take the same tack here that the FBI has taken with kidnapping over the years.  The FBI has practically stopped all kidnapping for ransom in this country.  Sure it still goes on all the time in custody cases.  But good old fashioned kidnapping for money...No pretty much gone.  And how?  Simple.  The FBI always got the guy.  They simply made it so if you kidnapped someone for ransom, you would get caught or killed every time.  Same principal should apply here.  If you kill an innocent American, anywhere on the planet, for any of a million stupid unjustified reasons, we should hunt you down and kill you. No matter what the circumstances or costs involved, if you harm Americans, we will harm you.   Simple.  Direct.  (Maybe even a bit brutal)  Unfortunate maybe, but extremely effective when dealing with people who dont understand speeches, just direct action.  Members of Congress, Members of the Cabinet, Mr President, please, Just finish it.   Arrick

      Now I know this might be a bit dated, but it is a topic that I have wanted to comment on for a long time.  With all of the recent bad press associated with the prison abuse scandal in Iraq, it amazes me still that no one has touched on what is really the central issue here.  U.S. Army MPs go through 8 weeks basic training, (like everyone else), and then have a very challenging 9 week military police training course.  Now here is the difference.  Regular Army MPs continue their training year round and are constantly putting their training to real world use.  National Guard MPs are sent home to their state units where they will be lucky to ever attend another training session geared specifically towards military police and prisoner of war operations.  Now, we send these under trained and under staffed units into Iraq, to replace regular Army MP units, in a very high stress volatile situation, and then we have the audacity to wonder where it all went wrong.  How could we Americans with our supposed hold on the high moral ground be involved in such brutality?    Simple folks.  You took out the pros and brought in the backbenchers.  This is not intended as a shot at the National Guard which serves many useful purposes.  Running the main prison op in Iraq is simply not something they were properly trained for.      Two more comments regarding this.  Brigadier General Janet Karpinski is an embarrassment to the Army and the President should ask her to resign her commission.  For her to backtrack and say she had no reason to check on her troops or conditions at the prison is assinine in the extreme and simply shows her complete misunderstanding of being a person in charge.    And lastly on this particular little ditty, did you know that in all 50 states of the Union, that an individual must be 21 years of age to attend the state police academies and become sworn law enforcement officials.  Same thing applies to the federal government.  If you wish to become and FBI agent, or US Marshal, or any of the other alphabet agents, you must be 21.  Not so for the military however.   As you need only be 17 to join the service with your parent's permission, that is also the only requirement for entering the law enforcement side of the military services.  ALL TOGETHER NOW... This doesnt make sense.  No it doesnt.  With that in mind, if it doesnt make good sense, then how can it possibly make good policy?   Arrick

      My own pulpit to preach from.  This my friends is long overdue and I am very excited to be entering the blogging community.  I, ladies and gentlemen, have a lot to say.  Now whether anyone will give a rats ass, well I guess that remains to be seen.  I have several topics I will be writing and commenting about over the next several weeks.  Please feel free to comment on any and all that you see here.  So, shall we start the big show?   Arrick

      By now you have seen an initial headline or done some reading about the 911 commission report.  To say I was shocked and dismayed at what I have read so far would be a massive understatement.  For the purpose of this article, I would like to concentrate on what I have read and seen from Dulles Airport.    Maybe we could have stopped the other attacks and maybe we couldn't.  That will be debated for generations to come just like the Kennedy assassination.  But we certainly could have stopped the one that came out of Dulles.  Four of five hijackers failed some part of the inspection, two of them failing twice, and yet somehow still were allowed to board the plane.  One who had failed two metal detector tests, still managed not to have his bags checked.  I have seen the video and many still shots already and it just reminds me of everything else about how crazy that day was.  To see these people pass right on through and enroute to their objective, sickens me like nothing has in quite some time.    The whole concept of security at the airports has supposedly changed now, but still, you have to admit those bastards made it look too damn easy.  And this is one of those times friends when I have been inspired to share with you my solution to this problem.  This is one of those things I have written about briefly before.  This would be the perfect duty for the National Guard.  The President should federalize the Guard, declare the airports "points of national interest", and assign the Guard to lock them down.  Check every single person and package coming and going.  And you revitalize the Guard, and assign them to duty to which they are better suited.  This is much more sensible than having them serve in places like Afghanistan and Iraq, duty to which they are not well trained or equipped for.  Additionally, they should take over all perimeter security for the nation's nuclear reactors.  It is scary how vulnerable some of these places are, even today.  It is noteworthy that The US Coast Guard is adding some 9000 troops, and has been provided a budget through Homeland Security that will update virtually every ship and copter in the fleet.  Its nice to know we are using SOME common sense about these issues.  But let's go all the way.  Most of the items we can address, we can do something about.  Yeah it might cost a lot of money.  But this is America.  We got the money people.  Let's not wait till it's to late to stop another attack.  Nobody will care about the money then either.   Arrick

      That's right my friends.  Former National Security Advisor to President Clinton Sandy Berger didn't know he was breaking the law when he was seen by National Archive representatives stuffing secret documents into his jacket and pants.  He was there "reviewing" documents in preparation for his testimony before the 911 commission.  The FBI who launched the investigation much earlier this year, has stated that most of the documents have been returned but some that there were only one copy of Mr. Berger has said"he can't find."  I mean come on people.  What are we stupid?  Does anyone really believe that this guy didn't know there was something wrong with what he was doing?  And if he really believes that, it scares me to think this was the right hand man to President Clinton when it came to defense and foreign policy matters.  I really would like to know what was on the missing documents that there apparently is no copy of.  And with modern day technology, why doesn't the National Archive scan and put onto CD-ROMs any and all documents that come into it's possession?  This one smells really bad folks.  If we're going to put Martha Stewart on trial for something so stupid, I certainly hope when it comes to the security of the nation that we intend to be just as serious with this inquiry.

      Well this might be the first common sense decision Ive seen made by a foreign government in a long time.  The Greeks have decided to allow US special forces and security personnel to be armed while working the Olympic games scheduled for next month.  This is in contradiction with Olympic tradition, and in fact, with Greek law.  It really is nice to know that some governments in the world don't have their head up their ass all the time.  The Greeks have obviously taken note that the world in which we live has changed dramatically, and have made a tough and brave decision.  The Olympic security costs have already surpassed 2 billion dollars, just to get set up and ready.  Wouldn't it be just downright silly if God forbid something did happen and none of the good guys had guns to react with?  Bravo to the Greeks for their obvious Common Sense!

      God am I sick of this moron.  This guy has been lying to the United States and the whole world longer than I have been on the planet!  We have a word in our President's second term, in his last year which we refer to as "lameduck".  Unless something critical comes up, this is generally a time for the President to get ready to make his exit, and only the most routine of matters gets through Congress.  Under those criteria, this idiot has been a lameduck for the better part of 35 years.  Get a clue over there would you people?  Those of you who want a Palestinian state, and I think there should be one, are never going to get it with this horse's ass sitting at the table.  Nobody in the modern age takes this guy seriously and most people haven't for the longest of time.  The next move is up to the Palestinian people.  You can blow up all the buses you want.  You don't even get to come back to the negotiating table until you are serious.  The most expedient and rightful way you could make this clear to the world, is to kick this guy's ass out in the street and get someone else doing your talking for you.   Arrick

      Martha Stewart got 5 months in jail, plus 5 more months home detention, for lying about a crime that the government couldn't prove happened.  They said as much!  Martha, while certainly not the first American female billionaire,(think OPRAH) was the first that wiser people than I in the government decided they had to spend my money to prosecute.  What kind of shit is this?  Shouldn't these people be out looking for Talibans?  (Yes I know how politically incorrect that is but you know what I mean)  This is the same bunch of idiots who have wasted untold millions trying to bring action against Bill Gates and Microsoft.  It was almost as if they couldn't get Bill (because he's smarter than anyone who ever served in government, they'll never get him) so they decided Martha was the next biggest fish who they could get the biggest splash out of.  Did I already say what kind of shit is this?  The only thing Martha did wrong here was hire a crappy lawyer!   Arrick

      The United States has posted a bounty on the head of Abu Musab al-Zaraqawi of $25,000,000.  This prick is the head of another bunch who thinks that by blowing up cars, buses, mosques, people whatever that they will win over the hearts and minds of those they are "defending."  It's always obvious when the US gets serious about gettin in somebody's ass.  How you ask?  The same thing we have always been good at.  We just throw a shitpot full of money at the problem.  Have no doubt friends this is a very effective policy.  The US is going to give you 25 mill and set you up like a king anywhere in the world your heart desires.  Mr. al-Zaraqawi let me give you a little clue about how this is going to work.  The problem with you son is that you have now brought yourself very unwanted attention from the mightiest country the world has ever known.  You've killed thousands in your quest to prove your point.  And what have you really accomplished?  You and that other idiot Osama, while you are both obviously serious players, we have mastered the game.  You have now seen what we are capable of.  Dont be surprised when one of your people sees the greener pastures of America and freedom and of course 25 million dollars.  You people have very badly overestimated your limited capabilities.  It was an old Brooklyn mafia chief who said,"When the elephants dance together, its the mice who get hurt."  al-Zaraqawi, I hope you've got a good tracker with you son, because I think I hear the elephants comin!

      About time!  The United states has launched offensive military operations against the Taliban forces still in Afghanistan.  US Intelligence agencies in recent weeks have stepped up security apparatus around the country based on "considerable chatter" by the terrorist network.  There has been considerable concern on an attack trying to intimidate the US elections this fall.  This military action is an attempt to keep the Taliban on the run and to disrupt planning for their continued activities.    It can only be hoped that any actions on the part of US and Coalition forces in Afghanistan, will shake the Taliban and al-Qaida leadership.  Osama bin Laden remains in the mountainous region there, and still is the most dangerous man in the world.  His ultimate capture and execution will end a lot of motivation for the people who continue to reek havoc around the world.  ANY ACTION OR MEASURE SHOULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE!  There are times when the ends does justify the means, and this is certainly one of those times if there ever was one.  ARRICK

      George Tenet who served honorably under two Presidents and was director during the worst attack in American history has resigned from the CIA after seven years.  Mr. Tenet is the person who told President Bush that the evidence against Iraq having Weapons of Mass Destruction was "A slam dunk!".  Although widely criticized in recent reports from a wide variety of commissions and congressional committees, Tenet is recognized to have served the agency at a time in history when it has met some of its toughest challenges.  He did a splendid job of bringing back the human element of intelligence gathering to the United States and was one of the first to reincorporate the idea that "sometimes you have to get in bed with a scumbag to catch other scumbags."  He was wildly popular inside the agency, and is seen by some insiders as taking the fall for the Administration's policy decisions.   Having said all of that, the White House needs to move quickly to fill this post, and the Senate should certainly not drag its feet with a confirmation.  At a time when the United States is facing potential actions by al-Qaida who we think are trying to influence our election, we simply don't have time to mess around.  The American people deserve to know that we have someone of the highest caliber overseeing the revamping of US intelligence gathering and operations, and keeping an eye out for what's to come.  They also deserve this to happen without the usual histrionics and idiocy that sometimes pervades our system.  We need a new director, and we need them NOW!   Arrick

      I have searched and searched and I just cant find it.  I thought for sure I was doing something wrong, and as I continued to look I became more fascinated as to who would be the first to help me find it.  GOOGLE News with their superfast news page?  Nope.  How about world famous Ted Turner and CNN?  No, not here either.  Well if not them, then surely Rupert and the boys over at FOX News will have it.  Hmmmmmm........I just dont see it.  MSNBC?  I mean surely with Bill Gates at the helm I will find what I seek here.  NO Damnit, frustrated again!  What about our foreign friends?  Maybe they can help me find that which I seek.  BBC, my fine British cousin, how bout you?  Do you have it here?  NO.  How about Pravda our fine new Russian allies.  Do you have it hidden away there somewhere?  SKYNEWS?  Anybody???  IS ANYONE STILL LOOKING FOR OSAMA?  Well the sad truth is that no one is apparently minding the store and keeping an eye on the most dangerous man in the world.  Al-Qaida works in cycles for those of you who are uninitiated in the martial arts, and the summertime schedule in the US provides a whole plethera of target rich environments for those wishing us harm.  And yet as I searched through the main pages of the world's most recognized news sights, I couldn't find word one about this man?  Have these people forgotten about 9-11?  Are they ashamed to remind themselves as well as the rest of us about what happened that day?  Those of you in charge of these news organizations should take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourselves if you are doing your jobs to the best of your ability.  People care and they should be able to rely on what they are told.  But what about when none of you are doing the telling?  I hope the next time Osama is back on the front page of all of these websites, its not because he's killed another 3000 Americans.   Arrick

      Yes go ahead and gasp my right wing Rush Limbaugh friends.  I went and paid my hard earned American dollars to go see Mr. Moore's "controversial" film.  As a purely cinematic experience, I found it very good.  I thought the part where he led into the story of 9-11 and blacked out the screen and used only sound was brilliant and terrifying.  I think I have seen the video and stills thousands of times since it occurred so this offered me a unique perspective to that horrendous day.  I thought he had a field day with the Congressmen and their gross display of incompetence.  There is one terribly disturbing part where one of the longest serving members of the house tells Mr Moore,"Sit down son.  We don't read most of the legislation we pass."  This was in response to a question asked of him if he had read the Patriot Act before voting for it.  Regardless of wether anyone read the Patriot Act before it's passage, the fact that legislation is passed every day that no one actually has read I find to be particularly disturbing.  If no one has read it, then how the hell is it supposed to be law?  I thought the use of the footage of soldiers on the battlefield, some of who absolutely did not know they were on camera, kind  of cheapened the overall product.  The mother of the soldier who was killed my heart goes out to as well as to all who have loved ones who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  History will prove their cause just, their motives true, and that they really did give their lives for the protection of America and all for which she stands.  If she stands for anything my friends, it is certainly the right to disagree with your government and to call them out in front for all to see.  For those friends who are pissed at me and others for going to see a pretty good flick, shame on you for this non sense and for Christ sake be a little more open minded.  Its just a movie.  Its not going to influence my mind any worse than some evil video game.   Arrick

      When seems to be the new question of the day my friends.  Not if but when?  Everyone seems convinced that after the al-Qaida bombed the Spanish rail line, they seemed to be at least partially responsible for changing the government over to one not as friendly to the United States.  This new government was democratically elected by the people of Spain in a free election.  Was the bombing of only a few days previously on everyone's mind?  Of course it was.  Was 9-11 on Congress' mind when we passed the Patriot Act?  Of course it was.  People react strangely sometimes when faced with extreme adversity.  WHEN the terrorists hit the United States again, and Im sorry friends but I truly do believe this is going to be the case, they will be doing so with the intention of influencing the American Presidential election.  Unfortunately for the al-Qaida, this is'nt Spain!  You see, this is the part about America everybody else just doesn't get.  When we get hit again, Im afraid that the average Joe Schmo who probably doesn't pay that much attention to politics is going to become involved in the process.  And then my friends they will elect in a landslide the man who they think will go out and kill the bastards who keep trying our patience.  Does anyone really believe that under these circumstances that John Kerry can beat George Bush?  Get your head out of the clouds people and remember who sits in the White House always gets the advantage as the incumbent.  Look at the team he has put together around him, and you see it's a virtual whos who of the US Government over the last 20 years.  Combine with this another attack on the homeland or the capture of Osama binLaden, and George will win running away.  The question is WHEN?   Arrick

      I am so sorry.  I took a week off and took the kiddies down to WV to see the grandparents.  My family, God love em, is woefully behind the curve as far as the technology goes.  While everyone has cable, computers and internet access still seem to allude them.  I guess Ive become spoiled by getting used to it.  Of course I lectured to them all about "not fearing the technology, embrace it."  My brothers flipped me the bird and my dad told me to shut up and turned up the volume on the John Wayne movie he's seen 176 times.  So much for bringing my kinfolk into the fold.  I have quite a bit to say as usual.(Big shocker) And thank you to those of you who have been checking in and getting on my ass for not writing more.  You may be sorry you asked.........Arrick
