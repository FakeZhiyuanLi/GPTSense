      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is cowardice ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Cowardice runs from it's problems, never seeking answers. A coward see its troubles and flees far from it, not comprehending the consequences of it's own selfish actions nor the issues that confront it continually.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cowardice seeks relief from it's problems yet never finds it. Cowardice turns to others to shield itself from the challenges presented by everyday life, thinking it is getting help. Help it does receive, but only in the form of magnification of these challenges. It is when this magnification overwhelms that shield sought by cowardice that cowardice runs yet again and seeks shelter from unresolved conflict, abandoning the shield it had once sought amongst the wreckage of the conflict, not for once giving a second thought the damage wreaked upon the shield left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Cowardice seeks only to gratify itself and itself only is in truly interested in. Cowardice feigns&nbsp;delight and desire in other things, often convincingly so that they whom shield it from larger problems are none the wiser. Cowardice will use any tools it has in it's impressive arsenal to lure and deceive others to itself so that it might not have to stand and face the issues which cause it to flee: issues that many have overcome, though not without trial and perseverance. These tools many times include self-delusional thought, lies or, at best, half truths and manipulation of both thought and emotions such that whomever falls prey to it is rendered helpless before the onslaught of issues that cowardice inevitably leaves behind. &nbsp;&nbsp; Cowardice is an expert at hiding itself wherever and whenever it sees fit to hide from it's problems. Indeed, it is so adept at such activities that it may not even realize what it is accomplishing. Sadly, the person most hurt by it's actions is cowardice itself. Constantly, it seeks happiness, self-fulfillment, self or extra-personal gratification, and relief from the everyday and monumental problems it seeks to relieve itself from. Unfortunately, it is these very actions that exacerbate the issues that it runs from, heightening and multiplying their effects until they are so great the cowardice runs itself away yet again, whether in fear or desperation or any combination of the two. It is often that cowardice itself will create an issue or series of issues that, on the surface, seem legitimate. However, these fanciful issues mask the real issues that cowardice is unwilling or unable to face without assistance: assistance it will never seek for fear of having to confront it's own demons and the pain, real or imagined, that they will cause.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Cowardice is also often unwilling to take a look at the wreckage it leaves behind, afraid that in this wreckage, it will see itself for what it truly is. Many times, it will blame this devastation on other persons or events beyond it's control. Some of these events are indeed beyond such control, but most are an effect of cowardice's own actions towards others thinking that somehow whatever has happened is not there own fault but must somehow be the the fault of others. In response, cowardice must blame others for their problems because in it's own mind, it is rare that anything more than a minor annoyance could have been caused by themself. Alas, this is one of the few coping skills at which cowardice accels or, perhaps more bluntly, one of the many games cowardice plays believing that some how shifting the blame to others will offer it relief from the issues and problems presented to cowardice.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Cowardice is often pious, believing in it's own rightness, and justifying it's own actions by the alleged or wrongly perceived actions of others. Cowardice is unwilling to admit that it might be wrong in a&nbsp;large majority of instances in which an issue or problem arises and stares it in the face. It will twist the truth and reality of whatever situation into which it enters, many times unwittingly, many more intentionally. (However, cowardice is often ignorant of it's own actions which deliberately lead it to more problems: This is as likely as not an unconscious action or series of actions. These unconscious actions&nbsp;are the response of cowardice to shield itself of culpability therefore providing itself an active&nbsp;policy of plausible deniability. In this way, it convinces itself that regardless of the facts, cowardice is not the one in which blame resides.) What is left behind is devastation and a high sense of failure on the part of cowardices victims. While these victims often do play an active role in the variety of situations in which cowardice seeks to run, they are often left with the impression that whatever it was that happened was entirely their fault, not understanding until later, if at all, that they were almost entirely at the mercy of cowardice and it's games. (Some speculate that cowardice is often a result of mental illness of one sort or another, and there is some validity to this argument. Cowardice will just as likely use mental illness as a primary excuse for there actions. Considering though that it is the failure to seek and receive treatment for these illnesses, or to remain on such treatment regimens that demonstrates that cowardice will often use treatment as a shield or crutch to relieve themselves temporarily of the problems they face,&nbsp;unable or unwilling to understand that it the treatment itself that will help them to overcome their issues and problems.)  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I have been the victim of cowardice, both in my own actions and by the actions of others. For their own protection, and my sanity and stability, these persons will remain un-named. However, I am sure that, should they ever read this "blog", they are inteeligent enough to realize whom I speak of and come forward and be willing to resolve all remaining issues to the satisfaction of all parties. For those I have or may have wronged by such times as when I fit this category of personality, I deeply regret the pain and shame I have caused for you and yours. I hope that someday I will be able to right these wrongs that I myself am responsable for as much as I seek the righting of wrongs levied against myself.

      Today, the 24th. I am still getting ready to move to Denver from I live now. The time is ticking aby and my only escape from reality is my job, at least until my time is over there. When I get to Denver, I will have to get another, but I am sure it will not take to long for that to happen. &nbsp; In other notes, I am finding that controlling my feelings is harder than ever... I am almost to the point in which I just want to shut down completely and become a robot... A human robot, incapable of any feeling whatsoever. This is what happens when a person is burned as badly as I was... Total devastation and loss of life. I can only ask why, but never understand...
