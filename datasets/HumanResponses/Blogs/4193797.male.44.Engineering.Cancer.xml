       Was listening to the Iron City Houserockers this morning.  The best band from Pittsburgh that nobody's heard of.  They got a mention at  urlLink Ol' Froth's blog , and I had the tape in the car....  so now it's on!!  Specifically, the album  urlLink Have A Good Time But Get Out Alive .  These guys were a lot of fun, not quite "top shelf".  Have a Good Time is sort of a Pittsburgh version of the Who's Quadrophenia, and did spawn a minor hit "Hypnotized".  I remember playing it over and over after breaking up with a very special woman back in college.....  Of course she and I have been married 20+ years now.......  Regardless, looking at Amazon.com, it doesn't look like there's any ICHR records currently available on CD.  Guess I need to figure out that urlLink  Album->CD software  I got recently!!

         Last summer, I took my son (then 3 years old) to the  urlLink Arch  for the first time.  I decided that after living in the area for (then) 14 years, it was about time I took a pictire of the thing.  So here 'tis.  It's actually just a part (though not exactly a small part) of the  urlLink Jefferson National Expansion Memorial .  If you're ever in town, take the time to see the movie on how they built the arch.  But that's the engineer in me talking again!

         Remember 1979?? Here's a quick scan of a snapshot showing myself, in my prime, along with friends including  urlLink Ol' Froth , MikeW and AdamH!! The key question is who's who?  Or is that who's whom?  Whatever.......         "Got little curled up alligators all over my clothes"

       OK, so skating is from the  Winter  Olympics....&nbsp; The games in Greece still reminded me of the whole  urlLink Tonya Harding / Nancy Kerrigan  thing, which in turn reminded me of the  urlLink   Shrunken Headbangers   .&nbsp; &quot;Huh?&quot; you ask....&nbsp; Why, the band with no shame, The  urlLink  Shrunken Headbangers  .&nbsp; And their &quot;hit&quot; song &quot; urlLink Club Nancy Kerrigan &quot;.&nbsp; Yes dear friends, that's my former  urlLink roommate &nbsp; at the center of the action.&nbsp; Check out the  urlLink sound-bites ....

        Another oldie, from August 2002.  We were in Memphis for a sewing machines convention, and wandered down to Beal St. on Sunday morning.  This is the line for the brunch at "Elvis Presaley's Memphis".

        urlLink Jones Soda  (a really cool product) has a really cool program.&nbsp; One of their neat features is the use of lots of different photos on their labels.&nbsp; My daughter, for example, collects Jones labels.&nbsp; Well, they also have an on-line contest where you can submit your own photo as a Jones label!!  People can vote on the photos they like.&nbsp; Supposedly, some of the submissions actually end up as  urlLink bottle labels .&nbsp; Of course, you can also order bottles (by the case) with your photos.&nbsp; Just a fun program.&nbsp; I've submitted a bunch of photos, including today's blog-shot (Yield).&nbsp; So, in a bit of shameless promotion, I'd like to invite y'all to vote on a couple of the ones I've posted:&nbsp;   urlLink   Yield    ,   urlLink   Mt. Wash. Overlook    ,&nbsp; and   urlLink   Spokane River    .&nbsp; Click &quot;Back to Gallery&quot; from them, and you ought to see all my submissions.&nbsp; Thanks for looking!!

         This is from the Glen Carbon Heritage Bike Trail, not far from my home.  I was on an excursion with my 4 y/o son (he on bike, me on foot), and had stopped for him to rest, and me to take a picture of an underpass.  This gentleman jogged by and set up this photo for me!!  Effects added in Print Shop Elements 2.0 (PSE2.0), including a heavy doese of Buzz Simplifier.

       Tonight's music plug is for our local community radio station -  urlLink  KDHX  .  A great resource, these guys play anything.   From Bluegrass to blues to soul to cajun to acapella to punk to jazz, to whatever anytime else, these guys are anything but boring.  Eclectic is the watchword, you may hate 1/2 of the programming, but the other 1/2 will knock your socks off!

       .  Just to prove a point....this is the transformer (as in only) supplying power to the airport in Juneau AK.  The box on the lower right with the door open is the protection, those are  urlLink Basler  relays inside.  We were upgrading the differential protection to new  urlLink numeric type .  Murphy's law bit us a few times, but it sure was a pretty place to be!!

            Near Ketchican, Alaska, spring 2002.  This was the first picture I posted on the "LSquared Imaging" webpage, back in April of 2002.  I was on a business trip to Juneau and Ketchikan, and packed my trusty digicam (back then it was a Kodak DC210).  Along with some really useful photos of power transformers and relay changeouts, I managed a few "art" shots.  When we were leaving Ketchican, we had about an hour extra, so we drove south along the water for about 1/2 hour before reversing for the airport.  This was taken from the spot where we turned around.  I made my co-worker stop, and scrambled out across the rocks to snap this.  We then had to rush back to the airport.  It was unseasonably warm at the time, probably in the 20's during the day, but I still had to keep the camera inside my jacket between shots to keep it working!

       So, what have I been listening to today?     (not in order)      Cheap Trick - Budokan 2  -  not as good as the first, but some great songs (like Downed).       David Johansen - Self titled.  Great record from 1978 or so.  I never had the vinyl though, had a cassette from my brother's copy since we saw him in '78.  Had to resort to eBay to get the Out-Of-Print CD.    F  u  n  k  y   f  u  n  k  y   but Chic!!     Robin Trower - Twice Removed From Yesterday/Bridge of Sighs.  Great stuff for repairing sewing machines to.....     Kinks - Sleepwalker - (vinyl version!)  'cause Its Only Juke Box Music, after all.     Grant Lee Philips - Virginia Creeper. - I recently got a handful of promo CDs, this was one.  The weakest of the bunch.       Heading to bed, will probably wind down with Rachmaninov PC#2      What about y'all??

       The  urlLink July winners  are posted at BetterPhoto, and the    BIG    news (from my standpoint) is that I placed a  urlLink finalist !!  This is my first finalist in over a year, so I'm rather psyched.

       I liked the way the one tree stands off from the others. The title is inspired by the   urlLink   Neil Young     song of the same name... This is Sliver Lake Park, in  urlLink Highland, IL . It's not far from  urlLink my work , a great place to spend lunchtime. Check out my  urlLink   Silver Lake Photo Page   !!    .

       This shot was a  urlLink   finalist    in last month's  urlLink   contest    at BetterPhoto.com.  I was psyched, it's my first "winner" since 6/2003!  This one was taken in Jacksonville Florida, during a brief stop while driving to the airport.  BP is a great forum, and I've learned a lot, even though I'm just a semi-serious amature with a humble point and shoot camera.
