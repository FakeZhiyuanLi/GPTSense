      :D  yaay!  Yesterday was so fun!   I went to my friend Hannah's party/get-to-gether 30minutes early.  XD   So we talked a while, then we played dance reveloution.  :D  I am horrrible.  ^=^   And then people started coming, so I stopped and we watched one of the dummest yet funniest movies ever... Monte Python and the Holy Grail.   O_o;;  I am still seriously cunfuzzled about stuff, but oh well.  Then we played dance reveloution again, untill everyone was gone but me and Hannah!  : D  She was taking me home, so...  they invited me to sleep over, but I had to wake up early to go to Michegan Adventured with my other friend.  *yawns*  Tired-E-ness.    So we decided to go outside and wet our hair with the hose because we were so hot!  ** :: see postponed note :: **   And then we started fooling around with it, and by the time we went back inside an hour or so later, we were so soaking wet!  XD  Funness!  So we wrapped towles around ourselves, and played flash flash reveloution on the computer, and then we got bored so we decided to talk again, then Hannah's daddy came into the room and laid pictures infront of Hannah, saying:  "Here you go,"   If anyone watches Frasier, then know its over :( .   But Hannah's daddy is really good friends with the guy who trains the dog, and the pictures were 5 signed group pics of the cast, and then 5 signed doggy pictures!  : D  And see gave a set to me!  *huggles Hannah*   She be so nice!  Then I went home, and narrowly missed my parents.  I was supposed to be home 2 hours before that... O_O;   Now today, I am waiting for my friend to pic me up to go to Michegan Adventures, a theme/water park.  Yaay!  XD  *falls asleep*  *groans*  to.......... early........... *yawns*

O_O;;   Ever since I was little, I made the mistake of going on a HUGE rollercoaster for kids much older than I was *hight limits, HAH!  I'm taller than all of those!*  and it was sooooo scary!  And I also made the mistake of going down a waterslide called "the Cliff", which went straight down.. O_O;;  sooo freaky!  But I have to rescedual my drum lessons then... ;_;  So sad... I like Andrew.. he's so nice!  Oo;; *looks at writing*  AUGH!  NOT LIKE-LIKE, JUST AS A FRIEND!!  *chases around in circle*  ^^  But oh well, I'll practice extra tomorrow!  Oh, tomorrow!

      O_o;;  Lack of idea for title gives you what you are eating right now.. o-O;;  Cookies and Creme Pudding sticks.  Oo;;  Hee hee hee?  My parents are gone on a one-day cruise with a Radio DJ and other winners.  This is the 2nd time my Daddy one something.  He won beachboy tickets, but we were gone when it was.  TT_TT  So sad.  =D  I'm making an ID Card for here, and I'll post it as soon as I'm done... if the oekaki stinks, I'll draw it out then scan it, which would probably be worse.  o_O;;  Oh well.  XD  Meh loves to draw.  La la la... when I go church camping, I get to bring a friend, yay!  Kayla gets to bring two because my mom said so, but I only wanted one.  =D  You'd think a tent that fits max of 3 would fit five girls?  We're getting a new tent!  Yaaay!  X3   When we go camping-camping, its gunna be storage, but for now Kayla gets the bigger one, because she has 2 friends coming.  Hannah and I are gunna have so much fun, because Kayla and I already have a big tent!  Lotsa room!   Kayla and I have been switching from new tent to new tent because well, we've grown a lot, and tents have broken.  o_O;;  Good news is:  I won't have my little friend this time for church camping!   I get to ride horses, shoot arrows, go river tubing... its so much fun!   Last time, it was SOOOO cold at night!  My sister and I woke up before five am because it was so cold, and we're able to work everything, but everything we needed for hot-chocolate was in the truck, which was locked.   X(  My parents had the key, and we couldn't wake them up.  So we went back into our tent, frozen stiff, and pushed our cots together, when in a sleeping bag, and cuddled up as close to the other as possible.  Both of us couldn't sleep, so we read and listened to our music.  It was fine during the day, but SO COLD!  O_O;; brrr... I hope its better this year.  Heey... *jumps to previous topic*  my id is turning out pretty good!  Yays!  Well, I'm gunna end this weird-o post.  o-O;;    Oh, and I'm still in the thinking stage about streaking my hair... O_O;;

      I'm bored.  : D  Wanna know something funny?  My friend called during me practicing the drums, and it was all funny, because I have to hit them like I'm aiming for the floor, so its pretty loud, and she was like:  "Becca.......... are you trying to play the drums?"  So I go:  "No!  I'm practicing a real beat!"  and she said Jason is laughing at it.    So yeah... I found that funny, so I decided to talk about it.    ...my computer doesn't like me... I'm trying to oekaki, but it won't let me... TT_TT  Its all weird, and now I have to wait a few minutes... I'm an impation ego-maniac.  -_-;;

      : D   Yaaay... I got twenty dollars for babysitting for two hours!  X3  Hee hee hee!  I love this world.   I now have over 50 dollars.  Wheee!  :D  Well, I have 160dollars out of the bank, but 110 is going in the bank... the rest is for when I go to Canada on my Mission Trip and for whatever.  Maybe even possibly streaking meh hair.  Yaay..  o_O;;  As I said, I am boring and strange.. don't say I didn't warn you.   Summer Vacation is... SO BORING!  BLAAAAH!   I've been out for almost a month now, and I still have two more months of freedom... How more boring can you get?  Oh well... *grabs trix yogurt* Yummie.   La la la... I'm going to a party soon.  Yaay.  : D   I'm getting her a present.  :J  I hope she likes it.  Well, technically, its not her birthday, more like her half, but I didn't get to give her a present on her b-day, so  I'm giving her one anyways.  X3    . .. .what is there to talk about?  Hrm... I vish I could meet all you peoples.  ;-;  But I'm here in America for another year, then who knows where I'll be?  Thats the cool part.  I'm voting for a small town in Canada.   My daddy found one vacant.  Its in Forest, Ontario.. its so small, and 10minutes from the beach.  And close to you guys!   So I said I want to go there too.  I don't like big cities... *spits on all US's big cities*  Too big, know no one.  La laa... I think I'm done for the day... gotta clean the two rooms I'm assigned, :: -_-; ::  and then practice drums and have lunch.  Well, ciao!

      I am so scared!  My sister has her two friends over, and they drove to BlockBusters, and my dad drove off because he had to run a few more erinds, and that he would be home when they would.   They got Secret Window... I'm to scared to watch it right now...   On their way home, some guy just stole my sister's purse! They were walking, and he just stole it! Ashliegh chased after him, and was about two inches from catching him when she used her head incase he had a gun, and well, she was in the middle of the street... so... But that purse had our house keys and car keys and one dollar, our blockbuster card... and did I menton our HOUSE KEYS?! Now some phyco teen can just waltz right in here!  I'm so stressed and scared right now... first my first car accident, and in the same week, we're robbed. TT_TT I am soo scared! Gardian Angels... where are you now?

      Today I woke up early to go river tubing with my best friend, Hannah.  Yay!  :D    But she called to say that it was gunna rain, so we wouldn't go.  Boo.   But she did say that if I wanted to, I could come over!   So I went to her house.  We were watching me fail horribly at trying to use the PS1 controllers, when all of a sudden... BAM!  Clear skies!  So hannah went to change into her swimsuit, and they took me home, and I raced into my swimsuit, grabbed my stuff and stole my brother's sandals.  XD     So we go to the store for snacks and drinks along the way, then we stop at the bank, and we ended up accidently stealing the container, so we had to go back... o_O;;   There were so many delays.  Then, our big one.  We didn't know if we were lost or not, so Hannah's mom looks at the streetsign name for about two seconds, because we saw a sign that looked familiar and a river, but then when she turns her attention to the road, all the cars ahead had stopped, so she screeched the break and swirved right, and we ended up in the ditch.    Hannah and I were out of it, because we had no clue what was going on.  We didn't hear the screeching tires or feel us swirved.  I only realized we were going into the ditch when the high-way sign was right infront of us and being pushed down.  Then everthing was leaning towards me.  o_O;;  A little farther to the right, and we would have been rolling... you know, car flipping on its side over and over again?  And that would have been baaaad... because I would be veddy injured.  But we're all okay, and suprisingly enough, Hannah and I wern't even shaken by it.  My shoulder aches, but thats because I slept on it wrong last night.  O_O;;   The mega question Hannah and I wanted to know was "Can we keep the sign?"  It was all bent and weird, but we were smart, and we asked the police woman:  "What do you do to broken highway signs?"  she replied by saying "We melt them down and make them into new ones" ... oh.  Phoey.  Oh well.  : D   So I'm in a police record, because I was in the car, but the rubber thing to protect from mud is ripped, and a few scratches on the car, but otherwise, the whole 'adventure' WAS SO FUN!  XD   :3  We wondered if the car was damaged if we would ride in the back of the police car, because we overheard the policepeople talking about "putting them in the police car".  XD
