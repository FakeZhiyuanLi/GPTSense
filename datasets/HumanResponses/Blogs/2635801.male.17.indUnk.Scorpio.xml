      that was awful. I go through too much to stay cool with you guys. Taking Timm ass in the face takes a lot of balls not to run home and hang myself. I Love you.

      I gestured Jackie over to me to make out at a wedding we went to on Friday and I let a huge, I mean huge fucking burp combined with Scotch and Miller Light.  It was funny until she punched me in the eye and it stayed half shut all night.  Ask L-MO Joey about the time I put my bare but cheeks on his face and farted while he was sleeping in my studio.

      sick? you've met me what, once? if that?  to be completely honest.. i don't even know who the hell you are.  yeah.. you're "sick" too. it's fair of me to say that considering i have no idea who you are or what you look like or what you like to do or where you go to school or work, etc, etc.  it sure is.

      i'd rather be someone who's playing for the first time in a few years and can pull off a simple song than someone who plays all the time and can't keep up with a poorly written guitar melody.  p.s.- no one blame me for starting an arguement when all i was doing is offering up some criticism. maybe i don't play drums often enough to be amazing, but i sure as hell know when a band sucks at their timing. not to mention the vocals making my ears bleed. fact is, you guys need about 7 years of practice. talk to timm. i don't like the kid but at least he and his band(s) can play/sing.

      I could swing by sometime and re write the blogger code.  I haven't done it since High School but I'm sure it wouldn't take more than a few hours and running a few cracks.

      Random thought...  If the earth was shaped like a football would the rotation of the earth change (more of a flipping all around action dealio)?
