      I am so woozy right now. we had a night out at viper room. Had beer + chivas coke = overkill!   Yesterday’s dinner at chili’s (with kak rose and pretty baby Isaac). We all passed around plates and shared the love:-PPP  Bbq beef ribs Rib eye steak with mushroom sauce Classic nachos (with sour cream and guacamole) Pints  At viper, I was recruited by amir as his unofficial spokesperson/cheerleader/assistant in ass-kissing. We sat with his boss gary and we both beguiled him with charming conversation (sigh). Kiss ass, ass kiss, kiss ass. Gary got pretty expansive and starting blowing his own horn pretty hard (why are drunks who get buttered up get really full of themselves?? Happens all the time! Sheesh!) as we left, khairul and his brother came. Pulled him to a corner and proceeded to shred his ex to pieces.   I still feel bad about that. Putting ann above him and berating him for leaving her. Boy, now I know why he did.

      Amir and I hardly have time for each other these past few days. After his shower and dinner and joint, he would (literally) pass out in bed. And I’m left all all alone with wati: I might as well be all alone! I miss my baby so much. But when I see him asleep with his mouth open and tousled hair all over the bed, my heart goes out to him and I make a secret promise to not complain.  Evidently it’s working: he’s been calling me like 5 times a day at work every day now:-D   Last nights dinner: Mixed salad (butterhead, aragula and mustard greens) with thousand island Carbonara with spaghetti (I’m sick of fettuccine!)  Mango juice 3 plump little joints  hehehe. A pothead I am. I am a pothead.

      dinner with mama yesterday:  starter: baked mussels with toppings (cheese, basil and bacon. Mmmm.) me: margherita pizza mama: roasted lamb shanks (oh gawd) amir: homemade fettuccine with cream marinara sauce   I ended up eating only two slices and ate up half of mama’s and amir’s dinner. It was so good! Was there room for dessert? Naw, but there was room for the sticky icky icky when we got back.  I’ll be manually checking each and every page of my company site revamp. Oh gawd. I’m so sleepy.

      diana was lost.   she frantically looked left and right, right and left. she took a few hesitant steps forward and then froze with fear. she heard stories about lost people walking about and complicating things further.  goddamn fuck it! she swore to herself. pukimak harrrraaaam. what the fuck do i do now?   she quickly reached into her little guess handbag and fished out her tiny nokia. the batteries? full. she exhaled a little. the connection? zilch.  feeling her anger grow steadily into a fullblown hissyfit, she threw the goddamn phone to the ground. the item split in two and she stepped on it, twisting her ankle to mash the poor phone to pieces.   she suddenly heard a familiar voice next to her.   "sayang! where were you?"   "where were  you ?" she spat to her stunned boy. giving him a withering look that lost its power because she constantly used it. she gave a little sniff of contempt and walked off.  "hey, hey, yang! nanti sesat nanti!"  "see if i give a flying fuck!" she yelled.   the boy looked at her disappearing form, and sighed deeply.   he went back to the girl waiting for him at a close distance. she had watched the whole thing while sucking on a coke from mcd. her other hand held a cigarette.  "so? apa cerita?"   "dia tak nak jumpa you la, yang. my sister memang macam tu... tak tahu apa problem dia. i asked her to wait for us for just 5 minutes and she stormed off just like that."   ***  and that, my friends, is my lame attempt at irony fiction. yucccch.

      i have finally decided what i want to do with my life!   i want to paint.   huge, acryllic abstracts of everything i love: the sea, cats, ciggies, a glass of coke.   i'm sick of copywriting. i'm sick of writing. i'm sick of writing this!   i think i need to totally fresh hobby. i mean, i can read like a madman but how many times can you reread the confederacy of dunces until you wanna puke and faint?   being poor is NOT conducive to being well-read, i've found.   in kinokuniya th other day i spied a thrillingly lewd victorian-age novel called fanny hill: memoirs of a woman of pleasure by an obviously leery, perverty john cleland. i downloaded the first chapter yesterday and i was quite dumbstruck.   di: this novel mula dengan lesbian porn!  amir: ?  di: no yang, you see, this book was written in the 1700's!!!  amir: suka baca lesbian porn la tu.   i love porn. literary porn.   on to the painting: yesterday, amir was thrilled with my proposal and started plotting ways for me to earn some bucks through my paintings (and i was thinking "macamana nak draw a nose? dah lupa"). he bought me a huge tablet of sketching paper, a pencil, an eraser ("raba") and a pencil sharpener.   i drew a nudie pic and trashed it before he, ain, brother, atan or atan's gorgeous girlfriend could see it.   will badger amir to get me some color pots. i'm going to paint tonight! no fooling around with sketches!

      last night i followed amir to viper. he was gonna pitch some harleys to datuk and his friends.   it was the WORST pub experience ever!   i didn't touch a drop (remembering how it was the last time) and so i was sober and aware. i chain-smoked tho.   and later, datuk's friend brought over a chivas coke. had to gulp it down. threw it up back home. amir was so apologetic about everything:-PPP   tonight's dinner: fettuccine pasta with meatballs and tomato sauce  mesclun with thousand island dressing no weed   ;-)

      It could all be so simple But you'd rather make it hard Loving you is like a battle And we both end up with scars Tell me, who I have to be To get some reciprocity see No one loves you more than me And no one ever will  Is this just a silly game That forces you to act this way Forces you to scream my name Then pretend that you can't stay Tell me, who I have to be To get some reciprocity see No one loves you more than me And no one ever will  Hook: No matter how I think we grow You always seem to let me know It ain't workin' It ain't workin' And when I try to walk away You'd hurt yourself to make me stay This is crazy This is crazy  I keep letting you back in How can I explain myself As painful as this thing has been I just can't be with no one else See I know what we got to do You let go and I'll let go too 'Cause no one's hurt me more than you And no one ever will  Care for me, care for me I know you care for me  There for me, there for me Said you'd be there for me  Cry for me, cry for me You said you'd die for me  Give to me, give to me Why won't you live for me

      oh gawd. smsed ann a moment ago and it is still on. asked her where to tonight, and predictably it went "wherever you want to go." goddamnit. why is it that me and amir always end up the organizers? she asked us out, right?  i actually don't want to go. i REALLY am not in the mood. plus, it's ann... and my uncle... don't wanna go! tak nak!   i tried thinking of some excuse. they weren't all very feasible. fuck it to hell.   last night:  delia: yang, hungry. amir: ... delia: dah stone ke ni?  amir: ... delia: YANG! amir: yes di?   it has been like this for this whole week already. both of us zonked out of our minds. our weed is NOT very good.

      i am 24!!!!   i mean, i've been 24 for 2 days already. still hasn't sunk in yet.  24 is pretty old.   24 to me sounds like a manager job, a pretty apartment in a gorgeous upper class neighborhood and a toyota vios. and a kid. and a beautiful husband.  reality: 24 is a struggling copywriter butting heads constantly with her peers, living with her devoted boyfriend and a another cute couple in a bedbug (read: PIJAT) infested hellhole, cooking up pasta with alfredo sauce for my devoted, laughing a lot, going out with friends and getting drunk a lot, sitting on my boyfriend's lap while he plays the chotaiti-gamble with his friends on our dining table, getting stoned and making lots of love, sleeping late on sunday and frying up bacon and eggs at 3 pm, sharing all sorts of secret ideas and feelings with my boyfriend and knowing that i am connecting with another human being who feels like a part of me.   24 is being there for my boyfriend and having him being there for me.  doesn't sound too bad actually:-)

      can you believe this guy?????      Sayang,  In the real world, I so speak like a typical Singaporean (that may sound very cinak to you, but I'm proud of that). That is who I am, although you might find it pathetic. I was a Singaporean (now a Malaysian... but I guess you know that) and no matter what, deep inside I am still a Singaporean.   Like, perhaps we can meet for a cuppa. Then you can tell to my face lah whatever you think is not right about me. From my experience, even meek looking akak-akak tudung, adik-adik jambu and abang-abang skema can turn into a monster in chatrooms, newsgroups and e-mails.   Okay now... enuf bitching. From you lah. Penat lah wei.. Ala2 if you're my drag queen friends takper tau... I know it's the side effects of taking too much hormon :)  Now I want to know more about you.   Delia sayang, you asal mana (lepas ni jangan marah kalau I cakap Melayu pulak tau!). Umur berapa? Kalau diberikan tiga buku... buku apa you akan pilih untuk ke sebuah pulau ala2 Survivor?  You tak suka dengan kerja you sekarang... beritahu kat I apa you suka buat sebenarnya. I mean now. Take this particular question seriously as if you are talking to someone that is looking for a job.   Delia wrote:  Dearest Nizam,   Naw, I am just pissed at your flippancy. If more people thought of what they have to say without thinking thoroughly first, THAT would make this place into a happier shinier world.   Anyways, I do not claim to 'expect great things' from you. I am only expecting forethought. You have a measurable amount of traffic in your website daily, and if you do not take your words with gravity there is probably some idiot who read your blog that does. Think about that. Be responsible to the integrity of your work and don't just lambast anything you like just because you imagine your readers don't 'expect great things' from you.    And if my Emails sound so terribly ominous to you, forget it. You've been buttered up too much by other visitors you can't even see straight (no pun intended). This is honest advice, from one writer to another. If taking my words and calling them 'negativity' will help you sleep easier with yourself at night, fine.    Yours truly, Delia   p/s You shirking away from my questions and starting off your email with pidgin English-Chinese is pathetic.    p/p/s I hate my job so just save your 'I'm just kidding!' insults to someone who does give a fuck about feng shui.    p/p/p/s i AM being constructive.    ----- Original Message -----  From: Nizam Zakaria  To: Delia  Sent: Thursday, April 08, 2004 3:28 PM Subject: Re: Fiction   Why you so marah2 one... I just don't get you. And please, don't expect great things from me. I don't deserve that. I do not take my writing seriously. If you doubt that, fine. But I guess you don't know me that well.   And really... why the anger towards me? Why all these negativity? Maybe... you should shift your table or something. You know, bad feng shui :) (and please... this is a joke. I really mean it!!!)  Okay like this lah... If I'm your puching bag and you want to turn me into a free theraphy session for whatever issue that you are facing... Don't write back. I hate the idea of you wasting  your time like this writing to me. Like, whatever for, right?   If you want, we can start by you putting a stop to all the insults you've thrown at me and we can talk about other things that are more constructive. You know what?  I'll be more than happy to accept you as a friend and listen to your part of the story and arguments.   Nizam "shiny happy people" Zakaria (No... I'm not on valium. I guess, I must have excellent feng shui at home and at work)   Delia wrote:  Dear Nizam,   So I take it you don't want your work to be taken seriously? I doubt that.    If you do want to protect your opinion, I think a jab at your sexual orientation is too black and white. As a self-proclaimed critic of the arts, I was anticipating something better than that from you.     Are you telling me that your imagination as a child was not spurred by children's tales (fiction, by the way) in television, books, film? Are you so sure that who you are right has nothing to do with works written by your favorite authors (fiction again.)? Are you so sure that your grasp of language has not been altered or bettered as a byproduct of your fondness for books?    Chew on that and get back to me.   Truly, Delia   p/s Crediting bad grammar as a result to being well-read is pretty lame too.      ----- Original Message -----  From: Nizam Zakaria  To: delia@fengshuitimes.com  Sent: Thursday, April 08, 2004 1:37 PM Subject: Fiction   No...  Works of fiction can never change a person's life. Or else... After reading so many books that have so many heterosexual characters in it, I should be straight by, now innit?   Or at least, be able to write with proper grammar, even for something as mundane as a personal blog.   Haiyoh... why you take things so seriously lah dear? So salah one if you take my writings seriously.   Regards,  Nizam

      kurt cobain died yesterday 10 years ago.  is it really ten years already? i'm about to be 24 tomorrow. 24. 24.   it still hasn't hit me yet: that i'm slowly getting older. i don't  feel  old. just a bit wiser. but i definitely still feel like a kid.  where am i going with my life? do i want to face 30 stuck in the same no-money situation? i can't even afford to give my mother any cash. it hurts.   kak enya is in edinburgh now. according to her text messages to my cell, she's having a fuckin great time. i'm so jealous!

      i've been sick on and off for like 3 days. it's all about my black sweater and striped toe-socks now. minimal makeup, no jewelry, go to work and bleed some, eat lunch and bleed some more after... rush my baby to pick me up at 5.30 and i'm home at last!   i'm wondering whether this is just 1) me genuinely being sick or 2) my body telling me it's time to move on.   i feel like i'm stuck in a goddam rut. there's no room for creativity. i write like a fuckin robot and hey, guess what, it's a damn thankless job.   i am just SO delighted to go home with someone who loves me and cares about anything i think. i can unwind, smoke some weed, talk a bit, read a little, have some sex then get sleepy.   i want to be a housewife!!! yang, dengar tak!!! i nak duduk rumah!!!   it's a bit shocking to actually discover than i have no ambition. save for the restaurant-pub thing. THAT i am passionate about.  i've been thinking and thinking at the back of my mind to just be a writer full-time at home, churn out pretty little relationship stories, and hope to god someone reads them. but in this country, being a full-time writer is just like being a celebrity. you need a supplementary income and your passion is just that: a labor of love, nothing more.   i love my country but when i think of the inprisonment of artists and writers here, i just feel like knocking some people's heads and tell them there's more to life than just your radio station and tv channels.   there's a whole other world out there. and everyone's tuned in, EVERYONE's tuned in, except you, malaysia.
