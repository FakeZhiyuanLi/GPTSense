      Today is a very sad day and more notably, it's been a pretty depressing last couple of days - and I just don't know why? We had to take our dog, Ferris, to the vet this morning to "get fixed" and needless to say it makes me kinda sad, but the whole process is being done so he won't be as vicious, and bity and hopefully this problem he has with worms will be worked out to. As for the past couple of days and this weekend, I don't know what my deal was, but I wasn't in the best of moods. I tried not to show it, but for some reason or another, I felt down and out. Maybe Monday's problem was because Kentucky lost to UAB in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Yeah, I'll try to type it again to make sure I'm not stupid, but yeah, it's UAB. I've pyscho-analyzed that game every which way I can think of, and what it all boils down too, is Kentucky just for some reason does not play well in the NCAA tournament. I don't know if it's coaching or if it's the phsyce of the players. I can't understand it - therefore - I'm not going to dwell on it and instead prepare for baseball season which is less than two weeks away. I'm making a valiant attempt to rededicate myself to baseball this year. I haven't been too excited about it in past year's, but I'm getting older now and figure that I need to have a sport that I can be factual with - baseball its for me - This will be the last time, but seriously, can you believe that UAB beat Kentucky.......lawrd......... We had our fantasy baseball draft back in Illinois on Sunday. It was a great time and a good chance for me to see the guys - Murf, Ho, Scotty, Dennis, Hawke, Kevin were all there. I'll be the first to admit that the draft is not nearly as exciting as football is - but it was a good time and I was glad that I got to see all the guys. It's been a while since I have "been home" and it was nice to spend the time i had with those guys. I know that I've made a more conscious effort to be a better person this week. I know that sounds kinda corny at this point in juncutre, but Cassie doesn't like for me to be an ass more than I like to be one - so I'm trying to keep things simple and just breathe and try to take things a little lighter than maybe I normally should.

      I'm frustrated - so I thought it would be in my best interest if I got on here and attempted to blow off some steam: I HATE MY BOSS (scott) His stupidty astonish me for something at least once, if not twice a day. I just have a hard time dealing with him on a professional level. I don't respect him as a writer - mostly because he usues other outlets as sources and just does rewrites - he has no creativity and very little personality. OKAY - I feel better - I mean what kind of person would I be if I sat here and cused, spit and swore about how little respect for a guy I really hardly even know. I try to make an attempt but it usually fails when he utters something that in context makes absoulty no sense. When it rains it pours for me....I had plans and arrangments to go to Lexington this week for the Sweet Sixteen Tournament, but the Calloway County boys' basketball team lost Saturday night to Carlisle County in the championship game so.....no dice for me.....However, Kentucky won the SEC Tournament on Sunday and looked very good in doing so. The NCAA Tournament starts this week, UK got the No. 1 overall seed. I like them to win the whole thing, but I have a funny feeling that they'll lose in the elite eight. I don't like to admit that, but too many good things have happened, we are bound to have a major injury that will cause some problems. I usually don't always play devils advocate - i promise -  So as of last night (March 16) I covered my last high school basketball game of the year. Marshall County girls beat Paduach Tilghman in the Region One Tournament. The Lady Marshals get to privialge of playing Sacred Heart, a team that hasn't lost a game in the state in almost three years.  I'll have my fantasy baseball draft back in Illinois on Sunday. That's always a good time. I miss a lot of the guys and it'll be nice to spend some time with them. Lets hope this is the year that I can be competitive  and not finish somewhere near the end of the pile.......GOD lets hope!!

      Well, I haven't been able to be as dedicated or devoted as I would have liked to my new little blogger, but give me some credit, I've been busy. High School basketball has kicked me in the backside the past couple of weeks. I spent all of last week busting my hump on the Region One Preview Tab, that might I add, looked and turned out quite nicely. I'll admit, I was a little pissed about the whole thing. The amount of time it took for me to do it, all the hours I missed being at home and etc. etc. etc., but the final product was very nice and I got many compliments on it. The Regional Tournament has been this week and needless to say, thing's haven't slown down that much. Albeit, I'm not writing nearly as much, but I'm taking a lot of photos, some good ones too. Some REAL good ones. That's the other thing, I'm taking all these photos, ones that I could sell, but I don't know how to get them out there. Plus, I have tendancies to be a little naive and I end up just giving them away for free in the end....NOTE TO SELF....quit doing that. So, I've decided that I need to "de-stress" my life. I've told myself that for about five years now and I have yet to be successful at it. Hopefully when basketball season is over with, I'll be able to take a breather and things won't be nearly as hetic. I hope, because I don't like myself or many other people right now. Plus, I've been having sharp pains in my chest around my heart and that sorta scares me. Cassie says that it's from too much stress - the last time I had a job like this I ended up getting an ulcer and that wasn't fun either - so I guess I need to take care of that.

      So, I've been thinking for a while now - how am I was going to start this whole process? What am I going to begin with - what am I going to end with? Unfortunatley for me, it's not that easy. Not for someone like me. My world is a up-and-down seesaw adventure. Nevertheless, I feel it's best to begin with what I feel is the most important and try and catch up to the present day. Jan. 21, 2003 - My grandmother passed away and probably one of the most difficult events I have had to encounter. My grandma was my best-friend. She took care of me, looked after me and was one of the best people God put on this earth. It's just too bad that God had to take her off this earth as well. I sat with her at the hospital. many hours...many, many hours. I slept in the waiting room. All so I could have just one more minute with someone who meant more to me now than I really realized at the time. My grandma, we called her Noni - she was Italian - is missed just about every day of my life. March, 2003 - A good month from a professional standpoint. Let me set that up by saying I am a professional photographer - not by trade, not by hobby, not by heart , not be design or necessity, but by talent and many trails and tribulations. Okay, so as a staff photographer for The Southern Illinoisan, I on more than one occasion shot the SIU basketball Salukis. I was allowed to travel to Indianapolis to shoot the NCAA March Madness Tournament at the RCA dome and to date is one of the most memorable events I have covered in my 8.5 years of journalism experience. August 4, 2003 - My first day of work as a sports writer for the Murray Ledger & Times. More importantly the fact that I get to live in Kentucky. It's always been a dream of mine, to reside in the bluegrass state, I love what the state has to offer. Lexington - - Louisville. Being a avid University of Kentucky fan, living in ky. has always seemed what I needed to do to complete a dream that I have been chasing for some six years now. Novemeber 1, 2003 - I got married to my girlfriend, fiance, wife Cassie in Carterville at First Baptist Church. The reception was at Oakwoods Park in Herrin.  I wanted the whole thing at Rupp Arena. Cassie and I were married in front of about 200 very close family and friends. We didn't have anything outrageous. Just simple and elegant. My best-man was my little brother Stephen. My grossman were my boyz Ragsy (Steve Ruggeri) Calfy (Jason Dunning) Killer (Shawn Kasak) and Cassie's little brother Jonathon. Cassie's bridesmaids were her sisters, Anna and Emily and her friend Dawn. Her maid-of-honor was Tierney. The flower girls were Ragsy's daughter Savannah and Shawn's little girl Madison. Following the reception we went to Nashville, TN and stayed at the Opry Land Hotel. It was very nice, romantic and we had a blast. I really wish the night and day would have last forever. All my friends were there from other states and family had came in. It was a special event and one that I will remember for all the days. My only regret was that my Noni wasn't there. She truly loved Cassie! Sometimes I think more than I did. The two had a special bond. Noni always called Cassie her "beloved". In a way 2003 was probably the worst and best year of my life. I mean, I lost one of the people I love more than anything in the world - and in the process had to endure a lot of crap - but in the end I married someone I love just as much and am in a place that I can now truly call home.

      I had a pretty eventful weekend. I went back to Illinois while Cassie was in St. Louis visiting her friend Sarah who goes to SLU....I didn't go home until Saturday, but that was the same day as the NFL Draft. We have an annual tradition of going over to Big Leo's house and camping out in his basement for a good seven hours. Thing's haven't changed either. Suzi, his wife, treated us to an opening round of buffalo wings, peel-and-eat shrimp, vegetable tray, chips and dip and a lunchmeat tray; four-layer cake and browines. Then after we were done with that she made us all italian saugeages and homemade freshly baked chocalte chip cookies and milk. COMA-TOAST for the rest of the day. But it was a good time had by all, while we mocked draft picks threw bits of food at guys that happened to fall asleep during the draft.   I went over to Carbondale later that afternoon where I picked up a certificate I won on Friday. The SIEA (Southern Illinois Editorial Association) held it's annual meeting on Friday and chose one of my pictures third place in the news contest. It was my picture of the family grieving after the tornados hit Metropolis last year. SO third place is nice, but I also have to remember that I am in the same category as people in Chicago and Sringfield. I would have rather got an award in Sports - but for all I know - the people at the Southern didn't submit a photo of mine in sports - or else I'm pretty sure I would have came away with something. I didn't even submit the photo that won so I am greatful for the award. However, I'm also very humble and modest when it comes to that kind of stuff. SO no one knows but Cassie and my folks. It's just not that big of a deal to me. Went over to Rags' house on Saturday night and spent some much quality time with my nephew. He's getting big and looks more and more like Stevie every time I see him. But he's my boy and I love him to death.   Sunday was pretty good too. I had lunch (bratwrust and potatoes and salad) at my folks house and then i went over to Rags where we grilled steaks and cooked corn and I swear by weeks end I guarantee I gained 15 pounds this weekend, but the scale last night said just seven. That's what happens when I go back home though -   So I left Ferris with my parents for a week. GOOD-frickin-Luck! It's not that I can't handle him, it's just that my dad likes to spend time with him and if that's good enough for the dog, it's good enough for me. It'll give Cassie and I a chance to take care of some things this week and start looking at houses again. That will be the important thing we do this week - start our search for a new house again .

      It's a wet and rainy Wednesday - probably redundant to say, but anywho. It's been a while since I have been able to blog (about five days) but I've been busy while trying to sort through the notion that Cassie and I didn't/aren't getting the house we wanted. It's not because we don't qualify or we can't afford it - it's because we put our bid in on the house about five hours too late. Cassie and everyone else say that things happen for a reason and if we were meant to have that house we would have got it. I don't buy into that philosophy, of course I don't like to think of myself as cynical and that "Everything happens for a reason.."  Sunday, my folks came down and we showed them the house....the part that sucks the most is that Cassie and I spent a ton of time the past week looking at houses - about 8 - and finally found the one we liked. Prior to that Cassie and I had probably looked at every house that's on the market....It's so stressful that you dread after to clean the board and start all over again. Nevertheless, that's what we're going to have to do and it really SUCKS. Saturday, I went back home for the 3rd Annual Ditch-to-Ditch run - it's our radio show tribute to the River-to-River...That was a good time, although I didn't do much of anything else while I was home. I saw a couple of buddies and I ran into my old football coach. We talked for a quite a while about a bunch of different stuff. He's a very spiritual person and has a lot of insight into things. Or at least he seems too! Coach Martin has always been somewhat of a hero to me. He's not full of himself and he respects other people. He's a very good family man and for whatever reason, no matter where he goes he earns the respect of everyone around him. Cassie is thinking about going to St. Louis this weekend to see her friend Sarah - I'll probably go home and hang with the posse while we watch the NFL Draft. But that's my only desire to go home, unless the weather is nice and then maybe I can go golfing - although I doubt the weather will hold up.....it never does when I want to do something!!

      I've probably slipped this past week in keeping up with things, but truth be told, I just don't get much of a break. It's probably hard to tell with a spotless desk and the constant googling of ESPN and random newspapers, I just haven't found the time to break stuff down. To be honest though, I just haven't had much to gripe or moan about. The weather was about 30 degrees the beginning of the week and it even snowed and then yesterday it was about 70! It looks like it's going to stay that way for a while. Which is nice, because I'm ready to start playing golf. I always consider The Masters as the week that golf season starts and with Mickelson winning on Sunday, I'm thinking about trying to get out on the course this weekend. I also received a golf pass from the Kentucky Lung Association. It allows me to play golf at different courses throughout the state with a small discount. I'm really excited about that, becasue I am hoping this year that I can actually put it to good use and see a considerable portion of the state because of it. I would at least like to play all the courses that I can west of maybe Bowling Green and at least try to get in one round at a course in Lousiville, Lexington and maybe Danville. The ulitmate would be to play at Valhalla on Lousiville, but I know that's not going to happen - there are pleanty of nice courses in Lexington - none of which are on the pass. (Go Figure!!) Of course playing golf and then my other task is to catch some minor league games - or at least as many different ones as I can. I'm pretty sure that we'll make one to Louisville, Lexington, I'd like to go to a game in Nashville, Memphis and Jackson, Tenn... Here's a quote I heard and if anyone can explain it to me - I would appreciate it: "Never try to teach a pig to sing: it waste your time and it annyos the pig." - Paul Dickson. WOW and I thought I was random???

      Not really sure if I mentioned how good my weekend was. It was really nice to go back home and everyone and everything be civil. A majority of the time was spent with Cassie's family, which was okay, they cooked an outstanding meal on Sunday and we all hung out around there till it was time to come back home. I know that at the beginning of June Cassie and I are going to Chicago for her cousins wedding, we are really excited about that. Although, I'll have to probably start putting adside some extra cash so the trip can be somewhat enjoyable. I'd like to check out of the chicago-life while we are there and hopefully snap off some photos as well. Then later in September, Cassie and I are going to Cincinnati for a Reds and Cubs game. That's compliments of her work, NECCO, and we'll have a luxury box and the whole nine yards. That should be exciting as well. I'd like to travel and see some minor league games this summer. Try to take in as many as I can. I know just from doing some research that there is a Cubs D-AA affiliate in Jackson, Tenn., Plus, there are minor league teams in Nasvhille and Memphis, as well as, Louisville and Lexington. I'm sure there are others. I'm really in the baseball mood right now - I don't know why - I'm usually not, but I'm excited about the season getting underway (even though the Cubs lost their home opener to the Pittsburg ButtPirates yesterday 13-2) LAWRD!  I'm reminded however that it's only April.

I like the one by Mr. Wright - sounds like me --- Sometimes when I reflect back on all the beer I drink I feel shamed.  Then I look into the glass and think about the workers in the brewery and all  of their hopes and dreams. If I didn't drink this beer, they might be  out of work and their dreams would be shattered.

      TGIF - not sure that the meaning of - Thank God It's Friday - has ever held up more than it does at this point. Atlhough it really hasn't been that busy of a week - I'm just glad it's over. I really could use a mini-vacation, but I will be going home this weekend. It's Easter, so Cassie and i will be doing the family thing from Saturday until we have to leave Sunday night. I'm looking forward to going home - although I understand the weather report calls for showers - it should be good to just get away from some things for a while. It was decided last night, that Matt Painter will be taking the head coaching job at Purdue. Matt is my boy from SIU who led the Salukis to a 25-5 season - I wish him the best of luck and I know he'll do really well. It's kinda ironic that now Bruce Weber, the coach at SIU before Matt is at Illinois and Matt will be at Purdue - both school's in the Big 10 conference. Should make for good storylines when the two teams play. I've been fighting with the notion if I should care or not about the situation that took place yesterday with Scott and he changing my stories. I could write them and then just not care, cause why should I. Although, I 've never been like that and have always taken great pride in my work and they way I have done things.  That's not me being selfish  - that's just me respecting myself enough to know that when I set out to do a good job, and it has my name next to it, I don't want there to be any doubt about what's being portrayed. That's sometimes what happens when Scott gets a hold of my stuff. I'll probably have to have a little talk with him and try to make him understand how important some things are to me, but I won't hold my breath with any changes coming and in the process, I'll just probably start looking for another avenue or outlet to work in...

      I'm really frickin tired of this bullshit. My acclamied sports editor Scottt Nanney feels it's in his best interst that he change every story that I write. I'm tired of it. I never calimed to be a pulitzer prize winning journalist. But here's what I do know. I bust my ass, every day, and for what. So that when I go out to cover sporting events I catch flack from coaches, players, parents about something I wrote, however it was inadvertenly changed by Scott. There was nothing wrong with it in the first place, yet, cause he thinks he's doesn 't like it - he wants to change it. I don't go looking for fights - but I do stand up for what I believe in and I just don't buy into this philosphy -I might loose my job over this, I don't want to - but if I do, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

      Man, I've wanted to blog for four days now. Not that I've had anything exciting to say - just that I wanted to actually keep a good track record this month and now look, I've fallen behind. The weekend was nice. Saturday, Cassie and I went to Paducah and we went to eat at Red Lobster (it might be one of OUR favorite resturants that is around) then we went to the movies and saw Jersey Girl. It was cute - a little better of a movie than I thought. I'm not a big Ben Affleck fan, but he was pretty good. Of course, to the normal man - that movie may have been a total chick flick and because I watch enough "Lifetime" to make even the manly of men a little less manly - okay - very random. ANYWHO! All-in-all, a good day on Saturday. On Sunday, Cassie went back to Illinois to make a tape for her cousin's weeding in June in Chicago. That's a trip that I can't wait to come around. Hopefully that will be a good time - or at least I know I am looking forward to it. I washed my truck on Sunday and I have to say that there are only about three things i really enjoy doing and believe it or not, washing cars is one of them. It gives me a sense of accomplishement. Only that and mowing and maybe lawnscaping - if done right - are some of the things that give me the biggest sense of accomplishment. Although, I don't do a lot of landscaping these days I might have to revert and change my answer to photography or at least capturing a really good photo - just makes me feel good about me - i don't know if it's an accomplishment. Monday - I watched two minutes of the Cubs season opener against the Reds. They won, which is good news, but to believe that I planned nearly six months around that first day and then I miss nearly the whole thing...CRAP...a good portion of the day was spent at Tater Day. It was my first one, but apparently they have done 161 year's worth of em. A little pointless if you ask me. It's a bonified county fair with cheap "prizes" and overpriced food. But it's perfect for the rednecks and white trash who like to attend. I also had to take Ferris to the vet to get his stitches out and that took all of 35 seconds. Meanwhile, I probably could have got in about four innings and still made it to the vet in time before they closed. UCONN won the Men's National Championship over Georgia Tech monday night. Obviously, I would have liked to see Tech pull the upset, but Omeka Okafer was just too good. HOWEVER, Diana Tarusi on the other hand is a man-child - sorry - WOman-child...but the girl is good. I was watching a highlight reel at the end of the tournament and she made a no look pass behind her head that was off the charts. That said, the UCONN women won the Women's National Championship Tuesday night. That was the first time in Div. 1 history that both a men and women's team from the same school won the championship. Needless to say, I'll miss Ms. Tarusi - she was a good player and exciting to watch - even if it was women's basketball. Rumor has it that Matt Painter, the coach at SIU, will be taking the head coaching job at Purdue. I have mixed emotions about that. Matt and I are pretty good friends and I would hate to see him leave, even though I am here at Murray now and really have no real relation with the school anymore. But I would like to think that I am still respected and I know that members of the athletic department were upset to see me leave. If Matt goes to Purdue, I know he'll do well - but I would like to see him stay at Southern for a couple of more years. That's obviously not a selfish thing - I think it's a personal thing. Matt is young and has the coaching world in his hand if he is successful for a couple of more years. ALTHOUGH, I have a feeling he'll go to Purdue and it'll be done by Monday. That's enough Random Banter for now

      These are enteries I found on my computer. I had good intentions of keeping a journal or a log when I first moved here - but that failed after I guess - what five days?!!?! SO - here they are:  Spyders Star Log 0001 8-2-03 It was a little over six years ago that I could recall actually searching for a job in Kentucky; a state that I feel has always been my second home. Well, after Gods strength, my Nona's love and my grandpa Woody's care - my dream has become a reality. August 2, 2003 I finally moved to "Gods Country." It's not Lexington, it's not even Danville - but it'll do. Come Monday, August 4, I take a job as a sports writer in Murray. I moved in with my best friend and the love of my life, Cassie, into her apartment in Draffenville. I’ve always said that when I finally move to Ky. I’d keep a journal, just to remember the special stuff and to find a way to forget about the bad stuff! What’s more important than anything to me right now is the fact that I get to change some things. For me, this is an opportunity for a clean slate. No one knows me and maybe I get to find out whom I am? I know there are things I want to accomplish; we’ll call them personal goals. I won’t change myself, but I do want to change some things about me. I’ve thrown a million pennies into wells, waiting for something like this to finally come along. For once, I feel like I have accomplished something. I did it on my own. I had no help, no help from no one – this one was all on me. Darn skippy I’m pattin myself on my back!!  8-3-03  The first phone call I got was from my boy Ragsy. The true meaning of a friend. We’ve been best friends for as long as I can remember. Sure,  I guess you could say that we’ve had our ups and downs – just like anything or anyone – but there is no one I would rather go to war with than my boy. Probably the person I miss the most – but as long as I have a friend like that – we will always be together. Things are going good for me on just my second day – although all I’ve done is unpacked and unpacked and unpacked some more  8-4-03 HAHAHAHAHA – they still paste up at this paper. You’ll have to excuse me, but that cracks me up. The Murray Ledger and Times is a little mom and pop paper with total number of employees around 18. It’s nice – it’s quiet. My boss Scott Nanney will be okay to work with – the other guys are cool? Scott seems a little, hell, I don’t know – I guess my brain is just kinda fried today – a lot to absorb – but give me till the end of the week and I’ll try to sum it up the best I can. Cassie cooked an OUTSTANDING dinner tonite. I guess it was kinda the first supper for me. Grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans and biscuits..yummy…  8-5-03  I had to write a column today  - my first one – I ripped on Nanney and his fascination with University of Tennessee. I liked it, I guess I did okay, but still a lot to take in and not really sure how to sum it all up.  8-6-03  Another day another dollar. I’ll tell you what blows – and that’s getting up at 5:30 IN THE MORNING to get to work. I’ve done pretty good so far. I’ve dressed very professional, I don’t know how I’ve done it – but I’m doing it! Cassie has been super so far. We are getting along with no problems. I’m getting a home cooked meal every night – well maybe except for the night before where I had bologna but that was probably the best meal I have had!! I’m handling work good and trying to make a name for myself. I’m fitting in well and doing what I do best. Being Me.

      April Fools Everyone. I was successful on a couple of attempts today. Probably the best, which might also be considered the worst, was when I "pranked" my wife into believing that the dog Ferris had escaped from the house. Priceless!  I've been kinda helter-skelter with "blogging" as of late - I've been busy, but I can see things on the horizon kinda calming down a little. Baseball season is almost upon us.  The Cubs start their season on Monday in Cincy. Everyone is predicting the Cubs to not only be in the World Series, but to win the whole thing. That's a far cry, especially considering the Cubs past and all the damn curses they have. I, like many others will go ahead and go out on a limb and pick them and Oakland in the World Series. Then I'll have the best of both worlds, with the Cubs and my boy Mark (Mulder) in the fall classic. I went back to Illinois yesterday (3/31) that was a nice trip, albeit a quick one. But I accomplished some things. I got my hair cut and I made my truck payment, but the biggest thing was getting to go by and see my buddy Shawn and his little daughter Madison (for me is Maddy-Moo) She truly is my girl and I love her to death. I was at the hospital the day she was born and have almost felt like she's one of my own. I had her in my weeding as a flower girl - Words can't describe the love and affection I have for her. And she likes me too - which is pretty good considering she is a girl!! Shawn's step-dad Greg got him and I a Boyle County Football T-shirt. The Rebels captured their fifth straight title in football this year. That's unprecedented in Kentucky - it's never been done before - and Shawn, Greg, my buddy Jason (Calfzilla) and I all witnessed them beating Paducah Tilghman in the Class 3A playoffs this past fall. I don't think I've ever been more cold in my entire life. It ranks up there as ONE OF THESE coldest football games I have had to encounter. The coldest obviously being in 1996 when I covered the Carteville Lions and they won state in Illinois. The rain wasn't coming down - it was coming horizitonal and right into our face - BRUTAL -  Well I'm glad I "blogged" I don't feel any better, but at least I got to do it. So it's with  that - that I hope I can make a more conscious effort to do it daily and keep up with the happenings that are going on.

      Well I've totally neglected my blog as other's that I'm typically pretty good about reading on here for the past week. What can I say? It's not that I'm lazy - it's just that I've had a lot going on. Despite a couple of hiccups I did have a nice weekend though. That's pretty much been the trend around the blog lately. Blog once on Monday and then wait a week, till I do it again. That's not very productive on my part - so I guess I'll just have to try harder.  On Friday night, Cassie and I went to Paducah, one of three trips to three days. We went to Linen-N-Things (so not a guys store) and Lowes (much better). I had intentions of getting my "Black and Decker Pivot Power Drill 3000" sounds like a water gun I used to have growing up!!! Instead, I got a featherbed and two pillows. So much for my toy, eh! It's okay, I think it was much more important to get what we did, considering we got them on sale and if I don't get the drill, I think the sun will still come up in the east and set in the west.....or is it the other way around.....!  Saturday, you'll never imagine where we went. Paducah! - Except this time we went in hunt of bedroom suit furniture and some possible patio furniture. Needless to say, it was all a total bust and we really didn't find anything. As upsetting as that was (not for me, I'm being sarcastic here) we ended up calling it a night by heading over to Steak-N-Shake (must have had a fascination wtih hypenated stores this weekend!!) We topped it off with a movie (Basic  - really, really good. But you have to follow it from the beginning or else I think you might be totally lost).  Sunday, my buddy Ragsy and his family came down to visit. The hidden agenda was to go over and see the new house, which I think the both of them really liked very much. We had to go over there anyway and have Jason (the owner) sign some papers. I think that's it's good for Cassie every now and then to get to go back into the house. Her eyes light up and she gets really excited. As for me, I keep looking for new cracks in the wall or holes in the floor or leaks coming from the ceiling....After house gawking, we went to Patti's to eat and then we took the kids outside where the looked at the animals. Ragy's little boy Logan is adorable at six months. Plus, he really took a liking to me this weekend which was totally cool. On the way back, we followed them to Paducah, we stopped by K's Merchandise. My intentions was to get a new coordless phone. We were in desperate need of one. You couldn't stay on the one we had for more than five minutes before it just shut off. POS. But after perusing through the store, Cassie ended up finding some bedroom furniture that I think she really likes. I'm like most people when it comes to buying such furniture from a place like K's, but in their defense - it was really nice and looked to be very solid and durable. I could have the whole suit paid off in six months too.  We finally made it back home late Sunday afternoon and now on Monday - I just found out that I'm going to have to stay in Murray till 5 p.m. Which totallly sucks becasue my brother is coming into town today and I'd like to spend some time with him.   For those of you who read this - I can only imagine how many there are of out there (maybe 2) - I'd like to apologize for just randomly blabbering about absolouty NOTHING. I wish I could wax poetically or had some genius insight to world issues or problems. I don't and I'm sorry. For the people I boar? Forgive me - maybe in time - this thing will get a little more interesting -but for the others..thanks for just letting me vent at times and have a place to put my thoughts and feelings....

       So this past weekend was Mother's Day and I truly belive that Cassie and I had a good time back home. Although, Saturday in general was a pain in the ass.  We left Kentucky around 11:30 or so, only to get home around 1:15 and Cassie hurried as quick as she could around Target, before we left for David Mason's wedding in Murphysboro at 3 p.m. - well instead of giving you an hour-by-hour rundown of everything let me just tell you this much. We went to a wedding, then to the reception. Then we went to a graduation Party and then back out to a bar when we finally got home about 1 a.m. or so....Sunday was brutal because we had to get up for church pretty early and then spent the rest of the afternoon grilling out at Cassie's house and having a good time on what turned out to be a pretty good Mother's Day.  I got to spend some quality time with Ferris this weekend too. He was very excited to see us - it was really sad to have to leave him behind, but for right now that is what we have to do in order to get the apartment in order. Befor we move out, which I don't even know when that is right now, I have to fix a screen that he poped out, I have to sand down two doors and repaint them and I need to shampoo the carpet.   I don't really know when we are going to be able to move in, I just hope its sooner rather than later. The only reason being is my "sports season" concludes in about a month. Meaning, I'll have all summer to spend in the house and do things that I want to do without having to worry about covering this at night or that in the afternoon. I'll have the opportunity to do as much as I want, which will be really cool during the summer.  So the Castle in Lexington burnt down last night. That's kinda sad cause it's been a national landmark for quite some time. It was one of those things that once you saw it, you knew you were in Lexington. It reminds me a lot of when I used to go to St. Louis with Noni and Grandpa and the one of us who spotted the "mall ball" or the "arch" was going to have good luck for the day. I don't know I think I can just remeber driving in the summer time or whenever I was planning a trip to Lexington and I knew I was finally there when I saw the Castle. I just hope it wasn't too badly damaged and that in some way it can be saved and rebuilt.

      So I just came back from lunch where I had a tasty meal from Bad Bobs Barbeque....I like that place - their sweet tea is the bomb. When I got done there I went over to Lowes to kill some time and this is what I realized while I was there.....1)  I have to be the most indecisive person on the face of the earth - and maybe that's not the right term, but this much I know. All my life I have wanted to generate my energy and emotions to a pleathora of different things. I can remember wanting to do nothing else but play golf....I wanted to be known as a golfer. Of course the same could probably be said for basketball and baseball. Albeit, these are all sports related and at the same time maybe there is something that can be said for diversity. But I dont know if I ever stuck too just any one thing. There was a point where I all I wanted to do was collect University of Kentucky stuff, Spider Man stuff or horse stuff. I love all three - but don't necessarily havae the time or money to do that. I've always wanted to simply my life - and I'm not so sure if all this applies to my original train of thought. Yesterday, after "blogging" I felt like I never put anything here in that's analytical or noteworthy - I just type random stuff and let it be. I guess, all of this to say, that while I was at Lowe's, I decided that now I'm going to put forth all of my concentration on being a home man. Building, fixing, remodeling......but can I really do it? That's a little upseting in its own right, but at the same time, I know that my wife thinks I'm a little "helpless" when a power drill is in my hand. I'm not so sure that she would trust me or just let me do my thing before butting in and saying, "Oh that's now how do that or I wouldn't do that, I'd do it like this.." One of my first projects at the new house was going to require taking the rock that's out of the landscape and replace it with mulch. Her response was, "Do you know how much that rock cost. I wouldn't touch it, I would leave it there," Ignoring the notion that by adding mulch (which i wanted to do) would provide more nutrients to the flowers and help them grow better. Also, the first time I rock gets loose from the bed and lands in the yard and I run over it with a lawn mower and watch it shoot out and go through the house window doesn't matter. I'm not bitching nor am I complaining about Cassie. I think, I just liked to be trusted with certain projects and know that I have the freedom to do what needs to be done. I think more than anything, I just need some direction in my life to help me understand what it is I'm supposed to be doing. I've been in the same profession for over nine years now. There's no glamour behind it, and I don't think i would want to do anything else, so I'm content doing what I'm doing. I'm not making that much money - but that's the path we choose in certain professions.  I know that I'm really excited about this house and i know I'm really excited about starting projects and seeing them through without having to consult my dad, cassie's dad or even someone like Shawn or Ragsy. I just don't know if that opportunity will present itself because of my lack of knowledge and other variables.

      So "WE" bought a house last night! How pimp is that. I have mixed-emotions about it. Obviously, I'm happier than hell that I don't have to be cooped up in that apartment anymore and we have something substantial that we are putting our money into. On the other hand, I'm not so exicted about the long-winding road ahead where Cassie and I are literally going to have to pinch our pennies to get things paid for. But I guess that's the fact's of life that come with buying a house. We are at that point and age where this was probably the best investment - in the long run - for us and I know that we won't regret it and be very happy with our decision.  This probably means that I need to renew my membership to Home Depot and Lowes. Not that I really ever had a membership, but I used to love to go and just shop at stuff that I would someday like to have...power saws....cordless drills.....big hammers. Lord, I'm hopeless.  I guess this also means that I have to build my boy Ferris a pin and have him a place where he can live outside. I'm sorta worried though that because we live in a somewhat wooded area that he may not "cooperate" with the deer, wolves, moles and groundhogs? I think the one that worries me the most is the wolves, but I'm sure we'll be able to figure out something....

      At first I was going to  blog because I felt bad that I had not done it in over a week and then sitting here - after countless hours of surfing the net and emptying e-mail and folders - I decided to blog because I need to just take a breath.  So, Cassie and I are in the process of trying to buy a house and I don't know if there is anything that's more stressful or more of a hassle than preparing all the paper work and doing the necessary things to put everything in order. And what sucks even more is that I am so damn obvlivious/stupid to the whole process. I don't know the first thing about intrest rates and mortages and lawyers and files and blah blah blah. I'm leaving it all up to Cassie and not that she's not capable of doing it - She's 10000 times better at it than I am. But I'm the "man" and these are all things that I am supposed to be doing. I know that the two of us are better off cause she's in charge, but I just wish there were things that I could take care of. Bless her heart, Cassie has a final today and has a job 4x nearly as stressful as mine and here I am blogging while my wife is trying to multi-task talking on the phone with loan officers, snot-nosed bratty kids and trying to cram for a final. I just hope that we can put this all to bed by the end of the week and at the same time it goes as smoothly as it can, without being painful as possible.  I have to say though that last week was not the best for Cassie and I, but since then things have been going much better.....We had a nice weekend, where on Saturday I picked the winning horse for the Kentucky Derby. Smarty Jones is my friend and I probably would have married him, but unlike the past 5 races, I didn't put any money down. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. But, my nona would be proud. She liked picking the ponies with me. Saturday night we went to Logans and had a nice dinner.  We haven't had Ferris for over a week and a half now. I miss my little buddy, but I know that he's having the time of his life at my mom and dad's. The only thing that sucks is that if we get this house, my little black buddy might have to spend one or two more weeks at home.  Okay - that's enough for my random, doesn't mean anything, banter for at least a day.

      Day II in Casa De la Spyder  Apparently my blog won't make the recommended headlines I type in so I figured I'd just stop that whole process and proceed with something else. Didn't really get much done in the house yesterday - not very productive - I believe that Cassie got most of the kitchen and dining room put togther and with that said, I don't really know how "productive" that was becuase she is going to turn around and paint the kitchen....which might mean everything will have to come out and then put back in???? Nevertheless, at least it's out of the boxes because that was just about to overtake the whole front part of house. We had our satellite installed yesteray, which after I realized we don't get WGN in our "basic package" NOW THAT JUST BLOWS - first of all, that means no more cub games. DAMN - and really that mean's no more news at nine. I'm being petty, I know...  I'd like to think that Cassie will get one of the rooms put together today. Personally, I'd like to see the living room finished and then maybe the bedroom. That's not really any of my concern and I shouldn't even worry about it. Cassie will get done what she wants when she wants and with it being a Tuesday - I have class tonight and won't be home until after 8 p.m. anyway.  Okay, well now I have more work thrown on my desk - so I guess I need to go and get started on all of it. Sometimes my boss is anal and he gets hateful and yes I want to punch him in the mouth, but I refrain and breathe - like he needs to try and do. Have Mercy

      40 Frickin' Light Switches....  We moved into the house over the weekend. What an ordeal! For myself, it all started about 6 a.m. Saturday morning - I loaded up the ride with some boxes and took them over to the house - at the same time I wanted to get some shots of the house from the inside and do some videotape of all the bareness. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THAT NOW...I wasn't smart enough to count all the boxes that we loaded up - there were pleanty of them and trust me it was pain in "our" asses. Tim, Cassie's boss showed up with his truck to help us load as did my folks who by the grace of God brought an 18-foot trailer that made loading everything up much eaiser. The only other help we had initally was Tia - who was an absolute tropper. Everyone showed up about 9 to start loading up and we didn't waste much time in getting stuff done. The trailer really helped, it made four trips instead of what would have been about 10 or 12 without it.  As if we didn't have enough to do on Saturday and despite the fact we had nice weather - it was still a little warm - anywho after getting all the boxes out of the house and loading up much of the furniture, dad and I went to Paducah to pick up the bedroom suit. Let me PREFACE this by saying we ordered this suit Memorial Day weekend, that was almost a month ago - we also knew at the onset that the Armor (spelling) wouldn't be in, but that they would have to order one. The gentleman told us that it would take two weeks. Four weeks later the Armor still isn't it and it took us over an hour to get our pieces while every Tom Dick and Harry who came up after us went happliy on their way home with their stuff. So being the compassionate and patient man that I am I asked some slacky why the hell I hadn't had my furniture yet and I had been waiting an hour. So the Slacky, we'll call him Spanky, informed me that it wasn't his problem that my furniture still wasn't out yet...I wanted to make it his problem but my dad held me back - for good reason - and I waited another 15 minutes for our dresser to come out and be loaded on the truck by Spanky and his co-hort Alfalfa, to my surprise (not really) that dresser was all scratched and dinged up on the bottom. I got the run around for the managers about what they could do for me and what I wanted them to do for me. Well I mean at the risk of sounding like a Jack-Ass I wanted my FRICKIN furniute - so some of the stuff will be re-ordered and is supposed to be here around July 4. Now, I will be getting free delievery out of it and since I'm the wrong person to piss off, Spanky will be delivering it during his lunch hour or at least that's what I told the manger.  Saturday afternoon, Ragsy and the family came down - they had been at the new house for a while while Dad and I were in Paducah - they had been helping Cassie arrange furniute and put together some of the patio furnitue. I had a good time with him, even though he informed me that in less than a month, he's leaving for Dallas Texas. That really chaps my ass and to be honest it makes me so mad that I can't even talk about it right now. After finally moving everthing in and getting people back on the road, Cassie and I went to Chucky Chesses with Rags and the kids....I was just hoping that somone reading that would wonder why in the hell I was going to Chucky Cheeses without prefacing it by including Rags and the kids!!!  We went back to house and met Tia we unloaded boxes the first of the 11-teen in the kitchen so Cassie could put all of her stuff up. Queen Clutter, I have to say, did a pretty good job of getting rid of a lot of stuff. I think a lot of it had to do with the persuasion of Tia - which means now that I can have that yard sale I've been wanting to have for like three years. And if I can make about &100.00 that's fine - whatever I don't sale I give to charity or something. We finally made it to bed a little after 12:30 Sunday morning - needless to say - the new bed we bought....I slept like a baby.  Sunday - yeah I know - as if I haven't rambled enough......we had to go back to that stinkin apartment and wipe it down top to bottom. whata bullSHIT hassle. And man that apartment was nasty - we got over there I don't know 10:30 or so (I slept till 9 - -WOW) and worked till about 2 and now that apartment is spotless ready for someone to come over and mess it up. We went back to the house yesterday afternoon and with Tia's help Cassie finished the kitchen. I mainly worked upstairs and in the master bedroom. I couldn't take much more of that kitchen, it was driving me nuts. But now a once spotless carport is filled with carboard boxes and papers and just shit that I have to get out and get to a trash dump or something. I don't think we worked nearly as long last night - but on a random side note - we don't have a shower rod yet, even though I SWEAR I bought one Saturday night, so I have to take bath's and now I've had two in two days. OKAY - that's more than I've had in my entire life. I'm afaraid what will happen to me if I have to take another one. Post-diaper era, I don't think I've had more than three baths, I just don't like em, I don't feel like i get clean enough - but enough about my hygenie - that will make for a good blog someday.  It's Monday...I hurt, my legs are tight my back hurts my elbows even hurt not to mention my shoulders and the bottoms of my feet. Things are coming along. Cassie posed the question - Do I feel like a grownup now? I guess in a way and in another way it doesn't even feel like my own house. I feel like I've been hired to come in and clean someone elses house and rearrange it..I don't know - it's still all real blurry. I think once I get things put the way we want them and it has a sense of stability it'll feel like my own house and mayybe then I'll feel like a "grownup"!  By the way - the house has 40 lightswitches in it - a little extreme - I know

      I'm so frickin' bored.......  I realized something though - it's random and holds no merit - however, I started this blog on the first of March...that was nearly four months ago. Now, four months (some-30 days in a month) quick math tells me that some-120 days....yet I only have 26 posts in my Blog. Man, I suck.  A quick update can tell you that in less than two days I will be moving into our house. That's kinda exciting. Seeing as how we have our apartment built like a maze for a labrat chasing cheese. If you can even open the door, you have to manuever your way around boxes and boxes and boxes and boxes. No matter, it'll all be out soon - on the flipside, when we move it all in - our beautiful spick and span house will look like Hurricane Isabell came rollin' threw.  We should have mucho help on Saturday when we start moving though. Some of Cassie's friends from NECCO will help out as will my parents - not so sure I'm exactly stoked about having that many people in the new house - but I'm sure they'll all be careful and it'll be much eaiser than having to do it all on my own.  (RANDOM NOTE) I'm losing all my hair - it's keeps falling on my keyboard and I have to blow it off - is this serious?  Garrett has left his position at Murray State, he's going to Louisville to be a Cardinal....I think it's a Cardinal Sin, but that's about all I can say about it. He's a good friend and he's not going to Bangladesh (who cares that I misspelled it!!!) I guess part of the reason why I'm bothered by the whole thing is that as I have said before, he's good people and I don't have many of them down here - especially at MSU functions and he made attending those a little more appeasing.  So the summer season is upon us here at the newspaper and not much really is going on. I'm still teaching my summer (hobby) course at Murray State. it's a bitter-sweet situation. The kids are great, but they have really no desire and passion to learn or from as far as I can tell, care about photography. I try to do what I can to utilize certain tools to help make them a better photographer, but I can only do so much, as far as I am concerned. We have another class tonight and from this point forward I'm going to try and step up the amount of work we do, using bigger and better cameras and trying to get the most out of them -if nothing else -maybe they will all realize they have a unique quality that is all of thier own.  Well I've blogged nothing of any importance and to be quite honest, I'm just trying to get things done for moving day. Maybe after this weekend I will have some classic stories to tell and maybe a new insight on some bloggin' material

      Slammin Sammy brings slammin rain shower......  Just my luck, the one chance I get to go see Sammy Sosa and have seats in the first row behind home plate, Sosa strikes out in his first at-bat and then Noah's Flood came and cancelled the game. Cassie and I left pretty early in the afternoon, enough time for us to get down there, and had to wait almost 2 hours before the game was going to start. It was pretty cool once the thing got going, but after Sammy struck out a thunderstorm and rain shower came cancelling the game because the outfield had standing water. The good news is that we can use our tickets again for any game we want apparently. Which is cool because the Diamond Jaxx are having a Mark Prior Bobblehead night. I'd like to get my hands on one of those! The Diamond Jaxx have a pretty ncie little stadium. Things are pretty cheap - our seats were awesome - I think Cassie had a good time excpet for the fact that it rained all the way home and Cassie tends to get a little more nervous than what is actually necessary. Today, is a slow blog day for me - I still have a lot to do and don't really have much else to say.  Kristin came back from her trip in the mediterrian or something - some kind of cruise - I'm glad she's back. Gives me someone to talk to here in the office, not as boring as it has been in the time that I have had to spend here....she had a good time, apparently. I see where she has taken a lot of pictures so I am excited about seeing those and she brought me back the 2004 Olympic Mascot toy from oversea's...it'll sit on my desk with Spider Man, Austin Kearns and soon Mark Prior!!!

      Just another day - just another dollar to what..........Live the Dream -   So unbeknownst to many including myself the little ol Calloway County softball team went right on ahead and won the state softball tournament. Good for them - crappy for me. I could go into the meat and potatoes of the weekend, instead I will just tell you that the championship game did not start until 12:40 or so and did not get over till 2:28 A.M. - - which meant after I got my interviews done and packed everything up we (jason yates and I) pulled out of Owensboro at 3:15 in the morning. Needless to say, I finally slipped under the covers at 6 am. Sunday morning. After getting a power nap - I woke up Sunday and commenced on working on my photos and stories from the championhip and really put in a full-day at the house. The state tournament was nice, it was a good time, it was hotter than hell - but fun. I met Butch Cope, director or programming and media relations for KHSAA. He's a good guy. I also met Marylin, whom I've had many a conversation wtih either via telephone or e-mail - so it was nice to meet her. Also I met Jody Demling from the Courier-Journal...much much much much younger than I thought. Not really sure what I was thinking, but cool guy; Cubs fan - so we got to give Butch (cards  fan) some shit! My stupid laptop still has that stinkin virus on it. It was bascially uselesst the whole weekend. I couldn't send any photos back from mine and in order to send any kind of text, I had to already have the e-mail open and ready to hit send as soon as I was connected so I wouldn't get kicked off. Bascially, it was a pain in my ass - but I only had to deal with it on Friday.  I went home (illinois) with Cassie last night to partake in her mom's birthday and to do Father's day with her dad. They made some kind of russian meal. Ummmm NO! Did not like it - at all. Guess I'm glad I tried it, but probably couldn't pay me to do it again It was cold and I asked cassie about that - she said it's supposed to be?? Meat - cold? wrapped in like a pasta shell?? Okay! I went by Shawn's last night and got to spend a little time with Madison. I love the way her eyes light up when she sees me. It's one of the best feelings. She likes to climb on me like I'm a jungle gym - she wants rides on my back and pats my head like a horse. It's not random, it's just maddy! She's awesome I miss being able to watch her grow up. It just sorta sucks - that's all.  I probably didn't get a chance last week, but I believe I found out Thursday afternoon that Sammy Sosa would be coming to the Diamond Jaxx to do his rehab. Which is pretty cool cause I found out early enough in the afternoon that I was able to get tickets and Cassie and I are going to go tonight. The game is at 7:05 and even though I have not had much sleep the past four day's, it looks like I will go another one before I can actually catch some shut-eye. With tonight's game, I doubt I will be getting home any sooner than 11 p.m. - and of course I'll have to be up early in the morning. But I'll get to spend some quality time with Casie, which is something that she is looking forward too - and maybe I can get Sosa's autograph for the new room I'm going to do in the house!!! The one I don't think my wife know's about yet!

      CASA DE LA SPYDER  Last night we signed some 30-plus lines and now own a home. Pretty exciting in one sense and pretty nerve-wrecking in the other. The house is in really good shape so there won't have to be a lot of remodling that will have to be done and considering the house is just six years old - it's in excellent condition which means we won't be throwing a lot of money (money we don't have) into redoing it. Cassie and I were very excited yesterday after everything was said and done. To show my apppreciation for all her hard work, patience and preservence in seeing everything through I went to Lowe's and used my new credit card to get her a "Our First Home" book. Bascially, it's like a scrapbook that you can put pictures of the house in, you can write stuff down in it and use it for guest. We'll be moving everything in on Saturday June 26. The owners, Jason and Tammy Wright, will be out of the house that Friday.  I bring up that point about Cassie, only to say this. As much as I appreciate all that she does for me- sometimes she lights my ass on fire. I still love her, but last night, as I was taking a shower she took it upon herself to turn on my cell phone and look at my call list while I was in the shower. That would't be that big of a deal, but she has already promised me once that she wouldn't look at anymore cause she "trust me". Obviously she  doesn't. She said that by her telling me that she turned it on, only to look real quick and then turn it off was her way of being honest with me....otherwise I would have never known. I claim that had she not found a foreign number (my mom called me from her friends cell phone) that she never would have told me. She's looking to see if I'm still calling Pam or maybe someone that I shouldn't be calling. That's really too much and the fact that by telling the truth isn't the issue. The truth is she should have never turned it on in the first place - that's what she promised me before - and the fact that she did it while I was in the shower is what's deceiving. I could go on and on - but right now it's not that big of a deal and I'm pretty much over it. I'm still a little upset, but I'll be going away for a couple of days, so maybe I will get over it...I will get over it..  Brandi quit a couple of weeks ago - something else I never blogged about. Not that I needed too, I never really cared that much for her anyway. But her replacement, Kris Adams, isn't much of a change. I don't know her that well, but she's a little loud (talkative). Much like John T. Wright, she's a little random, but I'm sure a lot of people say that about me. I particulary don't care that she listens to her tape recorder without headphone's - that's real annyoing and when I hear it, it reminds me of Cesear. He used to do that and I hated it. I have the same kind of equipment and use headphone's....for some reason I'm in a bitchy mood today - maybe it has to do with last night..I don't know?  Kristen's still gone on her tropical get away - that normally would be okay and I don't care that much because I have enough to keep me busy, but I'm use to taking partial breaks and striking up a conversation wtih her. I dont have anyone else here in the office that I care to talk to - but she'll be gone till next Tuesday. Which will really only mean I'll have Monday and Tuesday of next week without her since I am leaving for Owensboro and could be gone till Saturday. I'll be glad when she gets back - she makes working here a little eaiser.

      Recovery Time - not much of it - these days  Well while I was away on my mini-vacation, the Calloway County softball team won the first region tournament, which means they will play in the state tournament - which will get underway this Friday! Great. I just got back from a pretty extensive and somewhat expensive trip and now I'm going to have to drive 2.5 hours to Owensboro for what could be a day or two days. And actually it could be worse - the state tournament could be in Louisville or Lexington, which would mean a farther drive but it would result in a little more fun, If time permitted.  Anywho, a couple of things I didn't mention or talk about yesterday - - the strangest of events occured during a two-day span prior to me taking off for Chicago. First of all, I was asked by Murray State to teach a summer class to "Upward Bound" students. Ends up, the class is more of a "hobby" class for lower income, somewhat deprived high school kids. So there's no grade given - no homework assigned - which is probably better for me! Last night was the first night that I had to teach the class and needless to say, I was very unsuccessful. It's kinda hard to teach basic photography to high school kids who would rather doddle pictures of cars, pinch one another and twirl their hair while blowing bubble gum than listen to me talk about f-stops, shutter speeds and ISO's. The class is a five-week course and it meets two night's a week. Tuesday and Thursday's from 6 p.m. - 8 p.m.  I would like to believe that last night was just the jitters and if I am able to put together some kind of "lesson plan..i.e., syllabus" things would go much smoother and everyone would be much happier.  Also, last week - sometime - I was offered a job by the Benton Tribune Courier. It's a weekly paper in Marshall County and that would bascially be a step down for me. I never really took the offere seriously and was going to try to ignore the calls at all cost. But, I gave in and went for a small interview. After listening to the work load there is no way I would want to do that. I have it pretty easy and good here compared to some of the "crap" I would have to cover down there....It would be Marshall County - it would be closer to home - I'm very good friends with the A.D. Steve Woodward - they send you on good trips and they have the HoopFest. BUT - BUT - a very big BUT (like J-LO) you have to cover grade school and all levels of high school. B.S. I do a good enough job just covering the two varsity teams at Murray and Calloway. Plus, I would lose out a lot of time at Murray State by going to the Marshall paper.....which brings me to my next point.  I don't have very many friends here in Murray - let alone western Kentucky - but the few that I do have or pretty GD important - that's why I'm sad to say that my buddy Garrett will be leaving his post at MSU to persue a job at Louisville. He called to inform of it last night. I'm happy for him, but at the same time very upset - cause when I go to MSU games I know I have somone I can "pal-around" with. Plus, him and I became pretty good friends away from the "action." We took in a couple of high school games and went out for some dinner - but to stop blabbering - I'll be upset to see him go. Considering the fact that MSU is going through budget cuts, i don't know that they'll keep Garretts job open..they may cut it back or just get rid of it. I would hope that I could get that job because of my relations with those that matter. Garrett isn't even sure what they are going to do about it, but did tell me that he would put in a good word for me....now that's a job I would take

      Weddings, Wrigley and Regan.......   I fully believe that the reason Blog was invented was for reason's I encounted over the past weekend. To be more precise, it's probably been the last month, but I've been so busy that I haven't had time to record, therefor, may be a little off and/or random with my thoughts.  I just got back from a five-day trip to Chicago that was awesome. It was somewhere around 1-57 or 1-94....or maybe it was 290 (only if you are from Chicago or have ever drove that portion of the city could you truly understand this) that I realized how bad I wanted to Blog - so I could remember everything I was trying to absorb. A couple of times, when I wasn't driving, I wanted to just pull out a pad and write things down, but to no avail.  So, like I have said before - Cassie and I went to Chicago becasue she was singing in her cousin's wedding Saturday (June 5) in Dixon, Ill. The wife and I left for Chi-town on Thursday and made the some eight hour trek up North. The drive up there wasn't bad at all, despite the countless wheatfields and cornstalks, we arrived in the city at almost the perfect time. As we were driving in the skyscrapers and city view was shillouted by the setting sun, but by the time we reached the city, it was dark and the whole town was lit up in lights. Mind you Cassie was driving and I was taking in all the breath taking sites. When we finally got off the interstate and got into the city, the real fun began. Which way do we go? How do we get there? How did we get here!! It was a good time and despite our lack of knowledge for Chicago streets, Cassie and I drove for about two hours before we were finally able to just STOP and got directions for a little italian resturant and a hotel. Let me preface by saying that we probably arrived in Chicago about 8 p.m., but wasn't really able to stop till 10. Thursday night we ate at a place called Leona's. It was nice - we were starving and were hoping to get some Chicago Pie and a Pop. Instead we got some thin crust pizza and a tea (not sweet either). We stayed at a Ramada in Lincolnwood and made the most of some bad situations. Our first room we found our bathroom to be covered in sheets and the room a wreck. The next room the light in the hallway didn't work, but the one in the bathroom did, so the people at the front desk said that would have to do. Only in Chicago! On Friday, we drove out of the city and went to Schaumburg and made a stop at IKEA - it's a modern-day furniture store. Cassie has always liked that store, but has never been because of the distance, so we spent about three hours there, before leaving and driving to Dixon. We arrived in Dixon later that afternoon and found out when we got there that was the birthplace of Ronald Regan. Cassie claims that Regan was her favorite president and she has a good point, she shares the same birthday as him (Feb. 6). After finally arriving at White Pines State Park, we went down to the canyon where Julie (Cassie's cousin) was getting married and practiced for the weeding. We went back for what turned out to be a very good dinner cooked out by Chad (Julie's soon to be husband) and friends. Later that night, we "partied" with the wedding party - little did we know they were going to turn out to be hoytie-toytie Chicago bitches - but we made it through the constant beer drinking, loud laughing and all the immautre acts I gave up about four years ago. On Saturday, we bascially had all day to good around. Friday, Cassie's mom and dad went to Rockford to pick up Anna, a foreign exchange student that Uncle Stand and Aunt Roberta had about 12 years ago. She flew in for the wedding, but I personally really got to know her on Saturday and am very glad I had the opportunity. Anna isn't hard to fall in love with - - Despite the fact that she's very "natually" beautiful, she's also very sweet and such a good person. We went shopping during the time we had before the wedding and we picked up Spider Man and Barbie stuff for her two children. You wouldn't know it probably by looking at her, but I think the one reason her and I got along so well is she has a keen sense of humor and is a joker at heart. She cracked me up on several occasions and I enjoyed the one-on-one time I got to spend with her. Julie got married at 5 p.m. Saturday night on a beatuiful early evening. The reception followed and was equally just as nice. We spent as much time as we could at the reception before cassie and I elected not to spend another night with the hoytie-toytie kids and stayed at in her parent's hotel room.  Sunday, we got up and found out that on Saturday night President Regan passed away. The ironic and wierd part was that we were in his boyhood hometown. Very Odd. Very very odd. In the morning we partook in the opening of the presents at the hotel lobby with Julie and Chad and then drove to Regan's boyhood home and watched as people paid tribute with flowers, cards and gifts in front of a memorial. Cassie and I took pictures and for the first time in a longtime, I felt like a photojournalist again, trying to depict the event with that perfect picture. I think cassie really enjoyed it probably more than I did. We left Dixon and madea  return trip for Chicago. Our first destination was Wrigley Field and we probably should have made that our LAST stop. We got down to Wrigley in the eighth inning of Sunday's game with Pittsburg. Nothing could have been more chaotic than what we witnessed Sunday. between the honking horns and speedy cars, we were unlucky in finding a parking sot and ended up having to park in a "no-parking" zone at a grocery store about....ummmmm.....a MILE away.  So Cassie and I hauled balls down to Wrigley"viille" where we shopped with about 150 screaming Cub fans jam-packed wall-to-wall in a store and I'm worried abour car getting towed in Chicago. I wonder at that point in time what seemed more important to me. Nevertheless, we left the store and I was able to get some pictures of Wrigley Field and we went into a couple mor cub stores, but the anticipation was just too overwhleming so we loaded up and ran back down to the car, which lucky for us, was still there. After getting the F out of Dodge, we drove back downtown and ate at a original Chicago resturaunt, Geno's East Pizza, it was pretty good and we left there, only to realize that our best option would be to drive out of the city as quickly as we could to get on the road and drive as far as we could - which ended up being Champaign. Monday, Cassie shopped in Champaign for a while, before we opted to get back on the road (Oh, not before we ate at Chilli's, ummm ummm good!) We arrived home in Kentucky about 5:15 and nothing could have been better. Now, I don't know after reading this if our trip sounded as busy and as hetic as it was. I probably left out some variables, but by going on remembering that's the best I could do. But I do remeber some random things that really made the trip enjoyable. 1) Sierra Mist soda - can't get it around here, but DAMN, it's good 2) Chicago Sun Times and Tribune newspapers. Nothing out of the ordinary, but in the city they are only 50 cents apiece!! 3) Starbucks - and not just one, ONE on every corner 4) Dunken Donuts - Seriously, I think I only saw one Krispy Kreme place and it was in a gas station???? ODD!!! 5) GAS - There was one place that they wanted $2.55  6) Traffic - nothing in this world is worse than that frickin traffic. You either get going or you get out of the way. The people behind you aren't going to stop or slow down There are probably more - and I'm sure they will come to me - but for the time being these are my memories of my trip to Chicago and guess what - I can't wait to GO BACK!!!

      The Tripe-Dawg Thong Song SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. (AP) — Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women’s thong underwear blamed the stunt on a “triple-dog dare,” authorities said. The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct. When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend “triple-dog dared” them. They will not be prosecuted, authorities said.

      Here's a funny story: Yesterday, Eric asked Scott and I to come into his office to discuss the upcoming fall season and schedule. Eric has been toying with the notion of making us sports guys start working night's. That way it makes things a little more convienent on coaches and the whatnot (whatnot, I like that word!) When first told about the idea, Scott was very adament about not wanting to work night's. He gave such reasons like, "I won't be able to watch TV....I don't like working at night...." Well here comes the good part. Eric wanted a list of pros and cons after our meeting yesterday of taking on the night shift. I've yet to comprise a list, but that doesn't mean I didn't snoop around to find Scott's. Okay, in the Pro column - to his credit - he listed what seems to be four things, but after further review he marked out three and the only one left is...."the game information is still fresh in mind.." NOW on the Con side: Scott has comprised a list of 12 reasons why it would be bad to work at night and none of them are marked off!!! This Con List 1) No Nights off a week (well that's what it's called a job, Scott) 2) Lack of Communication between staff (You don't talk to anyone on the staff anyway) 3) Added work (Scanning, etc.) (You can leave it and if you can't scan it someone will and be ready the next day...) 4) Miss late-breaking stories (So will everyone else.....what makes us so special) 5) contacts harder to reach (No they will be easier because you can actually go out and talk to them face to face like you should anyway) 6) Daily Meetings (press conference - conference calls...OKay, I'll give him that one..) 7) Never see finished product (That's fine, you see if before it prints - that's how everyone else that works at night) 8) Later nights (yeah but longer mornings I guess) 9) More work for one person 10) Left in office on long trips (whatever that means) 11) Increased down time (again - ?????) 12) Racrer Pages, HS Pages more of a burden  This is just me - but I've worked an A.M. paper for quite a while and while I was there ultimely I had the night shift. I know what it means to work until 11:00 at night. Personally, I like it better. I think for me it has some benefits - but at the same time I know that working at night's can get monotonous. HOWEVER, simply put, Scott does not like change. He hates it and anyone who comes inbetween him and makes him drop his  juggling balls - it pisses him off. Then again, everything pisses him off...

      You can tell football season is right around the  corner..... On today's front page of sports - we had nothing but football stories from yesterdays OVC press conference. In the meantime, I've already started on one preview of a kid from Murray that is supposed to sign with Michigan later this year and I went out yesterday to do the school's football preview. I have Calloway's to do tomorrow, but with football also comes the prep fall season - so that means that not only will I have football previews, but I've already started working on other sports as well. It's not so bad - but because there are two high school's - it can sometimes get monotous (sp?) In a way I'm excited about stuff starting back up again. As much as  I love basketball, the problem with it is it goes for so long - usually middle of Novemeber until the middle of March - the good thing about football or the fall, albeit sometimes it gets cold, is that it doesn't last all that long. Ten weeks is the regular football season and come August 5 I'll be hitting the ground running trying to tie up any loose ends and finish all my previews for the fall sports tab which will have to come out that following Friday. The Racers were picked to finish fifth in this year's OVC race. I'll go on record now and say that I predict the Racers will finish seventh and that's if the wheels just fall off - but if things go well - I think the best they'll finish is maybe fourth.  The one thing that's a little upsetting about starting a new job is you have to re-accumlate vacation time. I know that if I was still at the Southern I'd have about three weeks coming. Instead I only get a week here and that's because I've just been here a year - the point is - between buying the house and just not having much money in general we weren't really able to take much of a vacation. Cassie and I went to Chicago for a couple of days which was really nice - but since then - it's just been nose to the grindstone. I know that we are going to try to take a couple of days before the start of football season. The options are as follow 1) Danville-Lexington-Louisville 2) Nashville 3) St. Louis 4) Memphis 5) Dallas - yeah seems odd but Rags and the gang really want us to come down.....

      To think it's been nearly two weeks since I blogged, but the ironic thing ism I just looked at my last blog and couldn't help but to laugh. I talked about how Alice needed to have a talk with eric about his anger and giving him credit - he had done a good job, till just about 15 minutes ago. The printer that we use back here is low on toner and instead of grabbing a pair of scissors and cutting the tape off the top of the box, eric would rather bust a nut trying to rip it off and then bitch about it. In order to retrieve the toner from the box you have to weed through the styrofoam - eric literally just hurled it out of the box as I'm typing this. He's quite aggrevated and quite P.O.'d for some reason. I really don't have too much else to bitch about (not that that's all that I do or even what this site is for) Scott was on vacation all last week, which was a nice break for many of us here in the office. Today is OVC Media Day in Nashville, Tenn., and so Scott will be back in the office tomorrow. It was nice having him gone, but I'll want him back in here sometime soon so that maybe I can have a couple of days off.  This week I will start my previews and stories for the upcoming fall schedule. I have three more friday night's off before football season starts (Aug. 20 first game) This Friday, Cassie and I are going to Louisville - I'm meeting Charlie there to do the Tyson Fight for the AP. That'll be fun - I hope!  The one and only thing I'd really like to do before I have to get into the hussle and bussle of fall sports is make one quick trip to Lexington.  A trip that includes a stop in Danville and then up the road to Lexington for at least a day and half of R&R.  Well the office is pretty boring around here today - a lot of people are off for vacation and for one reason or another - just didn't call in...Kinda Quiet - REALLY LIKE IT!!!

      So apparently my boss Alice had a conversation with Kristin yesterday about my health, stating that I need to gain some weight and she was worried about the dark circles under my eyes. As I am. I used to not be this thin - for those of you out there in cyberspace who know me (oh, I don't count as the only one - crap) Not that I was chunky, but at least  - well I thought I would take Kristin up on her offer to check my blood sugar this morning. I couldn't eat before she did it and usually I have already had a pop-tart or two by the time she reminds me, except for this morning. So after getting pricked it turns out I'm normal - well I'm at least healty as to say I don't have diabettes. But the fact remains that I do need to pack on some weight...I'll be the first to admit that - I don't particulary care for the way I look, but I think there's only so much I can do about it...  I think some people misinterpret what it means to work at a newspaper this size. It's not all that bad - it's not all that stressful and I don't care....nothing....should make someone want to punch their fist through a wall and grinding their teeth while they walk by your desk. Unless you happen to be our manging editor and then it's a regular occurance. I'd like to hope I put a stop to it today with a brief conversation, we'll just have to wait and see if it paid off?? He really does get scary sometimes - to the point that you don't know if he's just going to swing randomly or knock your head off.  The 2004 Mid-America Summer Hoops Classic concluded yesterday. Good event, not all that impressive or caliber of competiton, but good enough that I got to see one of the top rated junior's in the nation - Pierre Niles of Ridgeway -   I love the 90's premierd last night on VH1 - Classical...cracked my ass up. It was very good, so good that i noted different events to come back in here and blog. They did 1990-1991 and tonight is 1992-1993 I'll probably try to do something where I can combine the first five years and then the last five. For those of you who care I was graduating from the eighth grade in 1990 and entering my freshman year of high school in 1991!!!

      I spent a good portion of last week googling and efforting about Jessica Cutler. This story is about two months old, but I didn't remember about it, till I was trying to clean out my computer. Quick refresher, Cutler was an intern in Washington who's claim to fame was that she was providing sexual favors for members on capital hill. To each his own, but where Cutler really got in trouble was because after her many encounters she would blog them on the internet, thus, making the Blogger a very intereseting spot on the world wide web for quite some time. I was always under the impression that there were  select few people who knew about the Blogger. I know that's not true, but now Cutler is like some kind of Thomas Jefferson or even Daniel Boone. While she didn't invent it, she did lay claim to making it more popular and not that - that's a bad thing. There will still only be a select few people who decide to use this. What was more interesting about Cutler's blog was she was so blunt and wasn't afraid to throw any punches. I only wish my Blog could be AS exciting. Maybe I don't wish I had the same stories to tell that she did - most of them very graphic sex-capades....but yeah....reading her blog as intently as I did over the course of a couple of days - really makes me wish I had as exciting of a life that I could captivate people the way she did. My audience is about uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 1) that's including me - so I really doubt anyone is rushing to their computer to look me up to see what's going on in my life. The fact that someday something might happen to me, not like Cutler, but if for some reason I am in the spotlight and my blogs comes to the forefront I only want to say sorry now for how BORING and PITIFUL my life is to talk about.  The Weekend was good. I didn't much of anything. Cassie had her NECCO dinner on Friday night where I had to take pictures. The event went off without a hitch there was some mild drama, but after getting home at 12:30 a.m. I didn't really care and just wanted to go to bed. I slept till 10 a.m. on Saturday morning, but then got up and spent an hour at the RSEC to shoot the Mid-America Summer Hoops Classic. Some shin-dig put on by some money makers here in town. Nothing exciting, but when we got home I probably lasted an hour on the couch before I went and crawled back into bed and slept  for another three hours. Didn't do anything Saturday night excpet make a valiant attempt at hanging the light Cassie bought at Lowe's..it was a total pain in the ass and needless to say I didn't finish it until Sunday morning. I went back to Illinois on Sunday. The purpose of my trip was to go home and see Ragsy before he left for Dallas, but since he is a bastardo and already left, I really had no reason to be there. We did have the Fantasy Football Pre-Draft at Ho's house. All the guys were there with the exception of a couple - I drew No. 6, but actually move up to 5 becuase there is a new guy in the league and he'll move down to No. 12. I got to spend some quality time with Ferris.....man, I don't know if it's just me thinking this - but that dog really misses me. He wouldn't leave my side - he jump on lay on my lap (mom and dad say he never does that with them) and then when I left yesterday they said Ferris would go from the front door to the back door whimpering wondering where I was at and how come I had come back in yet.....so sad.... Well I gues my only reason for blogging now is to make it as nearly as exciting as Jessica Cutler's - maybe I should just move to Capital Hill..

      1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004  That's how many year's I've waited to finally GET to Kentucky.  Do you know that nothing in this world would make me happier than something that had to do with Kentucky. Even the stupidest of things. Froggy, OH MY GOD, Froggy I used to think was the absolute shit. Well now, I seem to be singing a different tune. (no pun intended) It's okay and all - but theeeyy taaalllk liiiiiike this. It's a country music station, I know.  When I used to cross the bridge from Illinois to Kentucky I used to salute the Welcome To Kentucky sign. Being in the bluegrass was all I ever wanted. That dream finally became a reality when I was hired here last August. Since that time, things have been good - but not GREAT and I say that was some distain.  Lately, things have just been downright shitty. Namely this past year, NOTHING has been good - really it hasn't. Things have changed. We have a house now - that should make me happy. I'm very excited about it - but at the same time I know that there are going to have to be a lot of sacrifices that have to be made. That doesn't make me happy.  Trips to Louisville used to be a monthly, if not twice a month, trip for me. I haven't been to Louisville since we played basketball there in Jan., I think. We used to just think that Lexington was it - that's where we are going to live and raise a family. Haven't been to Lexington since Feb. and the last time I was there I had to drop down 500 bucks to get my truck fixed cause it broke down.  I can't honestly even tell you the last time I was in Danville - it was probably when Kasey was working at the gas station and that only lasted like two weeks.  All of these things I couldn't wait to happen. Now I can't even find time or find the energy to want to do them.  I've thought that maybe I might have depression. Rumor has it it runs rampant in my family....maybe I do - but at the same time - having your best friend of 26 years move 13 hours away and then have a friend you've grown to know and like move after just nine months and then to find out that there are just some people in this town who are not fond of you - really makes it hard to be happy.  Plus, I don't exactly have the happiest of all marriages - which 95 percent of that is my fault - so i will go ahead and take the blame for that one.. I hate to come across as a sorry sap or a whiny baby - those aren't my intentions - All I really want is just to be happy. I want people to like me and not have such hatred towards me for adolescent incidents. I want to go to Lexington and enjoy a streak at DeShea's. I want to go to Lousiville and have a Skyline Cheese Cooney. I just want to have fun. I though that since we are pretty much finish with putting the house in order that I would start a clean slate this week. I should have just broke the slate across a marble rock and stayed in bed all week. Who know's, maybe next week?

      To Realize        The value of a brother Ask someone  Who doesn't have one.  To realize  The value of ten years:  Ask a newly  Divorced couple.  To realize  The value of four years:  Ask a graduate.  To realize  The value of one year:  Ask a student who  Has failed a final exam.  To realize  The value of nine months:  Ask a mother who gave birth to a still born.  To realize  The value of one month:  Ask a mother who has  Given birth to a premature baby.  To realize  The value of one week:  Ask an editor of a weekly newspaper.  To realize  The value of one hour:  Ask the lovers who are waiting to meet.  To realize  The value of one minute:  Ask a person  Who has missed the train, bus or plane.  To realize  The value of one-second:  Ask a person  Who has survived an accident.  To realize  The value of one millisecond:  Ask the person who has  Won a silver medal in the Olympics.  To realize the value of a friend:  Lose one.  All of that to say this - I know the value of a friend - I lost the only one I ever knew. My best friend for as long as I can remeber has moved away to Dallas, Tx.  This by know means that I will never see him again, but the strain and distance is there now and what's worse is that he left before I even had a chance to say goodbye. I know that you can stop the inevitable, but the fact remains that he and I did everything together. We played baseball together, we played basketball together, we golfed together, and even though I moved an hour and a half away, I never really thought that he would just up and leave like he did. I'm not being selfish, I understand why he did it - he has to support his wife and kids - I just take issue with it being so far away and I also think that I would have been better with the whole thing had I not called him last night and found out that he was already in Dallas. For whatever reason, I'm really aggreavated by this whole situation which isn't fair to my wife and some of those around me becasue it's turned me into an A-1 dick. Be that as it may, the fact remains that what Rags and I shared was something special. Something I don't think anybody could possibly understand. I think a lot of it also has to do with the notion that I don't have a lot of friends and at least with me living in Kentucky, Steve would make random trips down here to spend some time with me and hang out. The two friends I considered having here have since left as well - so I guess I'm a little on the depressed side because the few people I considered friends or people I liked hanging out with have moved away. I'm very awre of the fact that the sun will still rise in the east and set in the west and life is going to go on - but for a guy who didn't have a lot to begin with, I now kinda feel like I have nothing at all.

      A lot of things are on my mind today - mostly random thoughts - but nevertheless they are thoughts. In no particular order  1) Steve Parker resigned as Sports Information director yeseterday at Murray State. This comes as bit of a surprise as Parker has been a fixture, a mainstay if you will, at MSU for quite some time now. He's a good person and I liked him, but now that Garrett and Parker are gone - the scene around the campus will pretty much SUCK this year since now both of those guys are gone.  2) I thought that the summer season meant that things around the newspaper were supposed to slow down...I find myself having more work to do than I did during the prep season's....All things be equal though, if I can get them all down this week, I should have a month to enjoy before I have to dive headfirst into the prep world.  3) the Cubs are suckin' donkey-dick right now. Sorry to be so Blunt on the Blogger - but holy lord - we need to get healthy and the man, Jim Hendry needs to suck up his sacks and make some moves before the trade deadline. We have to get a better shortstop and we have have have have have have have to get some bullpen help.  4) I've just now elected to just chalk this day up as having too many things going on and instead I'm going to go get an oil change and see about getting a haircut and then coming back this afternoon to work on some pictures and put together some cds before I have to go home and work on some other rooms...... thanks for putting up with today's randomness

      When a editor or manager is breathing down your neck - there is really no other feeling in the world. My uptight and always anal boss, Eric, has graciously asked me for pictures of some golf courses (oh and by the way - he needs them NOW) which I don't have. I'd love to be able to run out right quick and snap them off for him and be back - well I would have been back by now when he asked me at 10 a.m. but my truck is downtown having the window repaired in it. The only problem is, the truck isn't being fixed because the windshield was broke in delievery and I'm waiting for my only ride, which is Kristin, who is somewhere walking the halls of the Calloway County Courthouse. It's not even Monday - it's a frickin Tuesday. And since I'm ancy in my seat, but patiently waiting for Kristin to get back, I thought I would take time to Blog - hopefully to put my mind at ease and think about other things in the hopes that she hurry's back here.... This weekend was a nice transition from all the hustle and bustle that has been going on the last couple of months. It was Fourth of July weekend and we had Monday off, even though the fourth was on Sunday. Friday night I worked - late - but that was okay cause I got to sleep in till Noon on Saturday. That was nice cause I don't really remember doing much Saturday afternoon, however, Saturday night Cassie, Tia and I went to see Sarah Evans at Stewart Stadium as part of the Freedom Fest Concert Series. She was there with Jimmy Wayne and John Anderson. First thing's first, John Anderson is obnixious to look at when he is singing - you would think the guy is getting ready to have a seizure and maybe it's the fact that I'm not 65 - but holy crap is music is old - and he sings like he just got done smokin 25 paks of Marlboro Reds and downing a bottle of Jack Daniels. Jimmy Wayne was really good - but for the money and the time, Sarah Evans stole the show. She's having a baby, her third, so that was kinda cool. Although she did admit that she was only 11 weeks away and her only goal was to not have her baby in Kentucky??? Ummm - so we're gracious enough to give you money for your stinkin show - but heaven forbid you birth a child here - I gotcha.. (IN the meantime, I',m really trying to keep a low-profile in the hopes that I can get out of here quickly and still get back in time to get those stinkin golf shots) Sunday, my folks came down - we did a little work in the house, but mostly grilled and went to Lowe's to purchase some more house needs. Cassie's needs actually - I'm not being mean - but she requested a new chandalier (probably spelt that wrong) and she wanted some new paint to do the kitchen...all fine and dandy till I got the "light" home and one of the globes had been busted - so now I gotta take it back... We were going to go see Spider-Man 2 Sunday night (it came out Wednesday June 30) still haven't seen it and everyday someone new ask me if I have. They can't believe that I haven't - and I can't either. I guess I've just been too consumed with the house and trying to get done everything else that stoping for 2 hours and spending 18 bucks is just something I don't have time for right now... Instead we watched 50 first dates - it was really good - Funny with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore - really cute, but Cassie ended up buying the movie Monster - it was only 6 bucks - but I think that might have been the raunciest and most disturbing movie I have seen in quite some time... Anywho if you c an't already tell I had a pretty relaxing weekend, makes it hard to come back to work on day's like today when everyone wants wants wants and wants some more....ya know

      I've neglected the blog this week - not for any other reason - only than I've been really busy. Which in some cases can be a good thing, in this case, it gives my blog more substance and I can recount all the things from this past week. 1) I cant' really remember when the last time was that I blogged but I'm thinking it was around Tuesday -which means on Wednesday was day three in our house, but the ironic thing was we didn't spend any time in there. Recalling, I left work pretty early and met my mom and Stephen at the house. My mom helped Cassie take down the wall-paper in the kitchen and Stepehen and I loaded carboard boxes and trash in the back of the truck to take to the dump. EXCITING - I know. It was a semi-porductive day getting some of the junk out of the way. Later that afternoon, after Mom and Bubs left, Cassie and I went back to Illinois to see Rags and Janette. Our purpose there was something a little out of the ordinary as Cassie wanted to go through some of Janette's baby clothes before she sold them in a yard sale. Needless to say, we ended up spending $75 dollars on clothes and I guess what you call equipment. That's all fine and dandy (wow - that's a country term) but there was no need to purchase at this point and juncture cause Cassie's not even carrying a child. Nevertheless, it was better to go home so I could spend some time with Steve before he leaves - I have to be honest with myself and still say that I can't quite talk about him moving away cause I just can't deal with it. I'm also not afraid to admit that on the way home I found myself wanting to break down on many occasions because I just never thought he would move that far away. 2) Thursday, I interviewed Tubby Smith in Smithland - kinda ironic with the last name and all. Not to toot my own horn, but it was a really good interview from my standpoint. We touched on a variety of subjects...The new recuriting class, Tayshaun Prince being on a team that won the NBA title, the fact that Tubby was named as one of the most influential minorities in sports. It was a poll put out by Sports Illustrated and to Tubby's surprise - he didn't even know of the distinction. So I kinda broke a big story to him. He's a very humble and modest man. I'lll be the first to admit that I have ran his name in the ground as coach of UK. I guess for my passion for Rick Pitino - I couldn't have more hatred for Bendict Rick now. Tubby is a good guy - I'm sure I'll still disagree with a lot of his calls and decisions, but really I don't know if there is a better coach for UK than Tubby. Thursday also marked the second to last day for my photography class at Murray State. Tuesday will be our last one - I'll probably talk about it more as the time approaches. 3) It was a pretty hetic day at the office, I worked diligently to get my Tubby story done. All-in-all I think it turned out pretty well. It was one of my more favorite stories to do. I went home and Cassie and I went to Paduach to run some errands. We went to the mall for a little while and low and behold I ran into Travis Ford, the head coach at Eastern Kentucky University. Travis is also a former player at UK. So it's been a week of who's who of UK basketball for me. I'm at work right now - Friday night about 8:50 - I'm waiting for some stories to come across the wire and finish pasting up pages so I can enjoy my three day weekend. 4) Sarah Evans will be in concert at Murray State tomorrow night as part of the Freedom Fest in Murray. That will be fun, I find her music to be very upbeat and plus she's easy on the eyes....very easy on the eyes. Bascially, she's HOT. I do belive that my parents will make another trip down this weekend to help with the house, it's coming along nicely - but - we still have some rooms that need work. The kitchen still needs to be painted and the living room is still far away from being done - as is the bedroom and the two rooms upstairs. I'll enjoy my time off this weekend since I don't have to work on Monday, I've been pretty tired this week and could use the time to recharge my batteries.

      BITE ME! I know - I haven't blogged in over a week. But really, who cares, I'm the only one who reads it anyway!! So a lot has been going on. Thursday marked the first day of prep season for me as golf got underway here in town. The other three, Football, Soccer and Volleyball won't start until next week, but I've spent a good portion of this week putting the finishing touches on previews and photos for the upcoming football tab. The only problem is that I'm leaving for vacation (tonight) but I'm not actually going anywhere till this weekend. I believe a trip to Lexington is in store. Maybe a drive by into Danville - all sounds like a great time to me. The other problem that I percieve is even though I'm taking a vacation - I'll still be spending a day if not two still trying to finish previews and get stories. Apparently I am the only one around here who can do such things and in return it makes my life a living hell!  I've been battling a head cold for a couple of days now - which has made me really tired and sleepy. My intentions of going home and getting stories done has not happened for a couple of reasons: 1) I don't have a laptop right now because mine crashed and 2) I just haven't felt like it.  I'm trying to think here - I don't have any good stories to tell. My beloved cubbies are now just one-game up on San Diego in the wild card. That's disturbing becuase the frickin Cardinals never seem to lose and we have been hit and miss the last week or so after starting the first six days of the month off undfeated.  For those of you who do care - I do plan on putting together the photoblog and sportsshooter website together while I am on vacation. The sportsshooter I'm not so sure about at this point in juncutre, but when I do have it up and running I'll post the website so you can all stay on the lookout for that.  Then again, like I said, I'm the only one who reads this!!

      Today marks my one-year anniversary at the good ol' Murray Ledger & Times. Quite honestly, it's been a rough transistion to make from everyday all-life photographer to just doing sports again. I weclomed the changed with open arms for a couple of reasons. 1) I really disliked my boss at the Southern for many reasons, none of which I want to remeber to put on here. 2) A dream of finally moving to Kentucky was going to become a reality...however, it wasn't going to be Danville, Lexington or Louisville. I was familiar enough with Murray that I felt comfortable making the move. Things got off to a rough start and the road to happiness still has some bumps in it. My sports editor and I have bumped heads on more than one, two, three, four five, six occassions.....you get the point.....For a while this place was pretty prehistoric and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to adapt to life as a Flintstone again. However, in a year's time, the paper has 1) bought a better digitial camera for sports [even though I bought my own for myself first] 2) We got better iMAC computers with flat screens and updated versions of programs like Photostop and Quark 3) We are no longer pasting up pages..THANK GOD - So that's some of the changes that have been made at the MLT - I think I've made some changes of my own. Wether they are for the good or for the bad - I guess the jury is still out on that one. A quick list of some of the things I have covered in one year 1) MSU vs. UK in football at  Commonwealth 2) MSU vs. UL in basketball at Freedom Hall 3) ALL 'A' CLASSIC basketball tournament in Richmond 4) KHSAA girls fast-pitch state softball tournament in Owensboro 5) Mike Tyson vs. Danny Williams at Freedom Hall

      Either I was so excited about talking about Tyson or reliving my memories over the weekend that I think I failed to probably mention one of the most important things that happened. one word: NOMAH! And for those of you who don't know that would be Nomar Garciarparra - who was traded from the Boston Red Sox to the Chicago Cubs. Finally the cubbies have, in my opinion, the lineup the need to score some runs. I'll be the first to admit that the bullpen is a tick away from a heartattack - but maybe if we score enough runs now - it won't matter as much! Getting Nomar from Boston was a giant sized dream for a while. I never imagined that my beloved Cubs would be able to pull it off. Originally, it was supposed to be a three-way deal with Arizon and Boston for Randy Johnson. Johnson decided (since he has a no trade clause) that the only place he would go is New York...which for some time nixed the notion of Nomar coming to Chicago. It ended up being a four-team deal with Minessota, Montreal and Boston and what's even better is we didn't even have to give anything up for him. I've been a big Nomar fan even before he was in the majors. I remember him from Georgia Tech, who I loved when I was in high school and into college, they usually turn out good baseball teams and I was a fan of Nomar and Jason Varitek.... Some say this is the key to get Chicago's motor running into the playoffs. Heaven help me if we don't make the playoffs now - after the acquisition of Nomar - Chicago will literally burn down by the rabbid fans. Trust Me. 17 more days till High School football season starts - I'd like to be honest and tell you that I'm really excited. I'm not. One team is going to suck and the other is going to be good, but only because they are playing sucking competition. From a viewing perspective, I'd rather watch the team that's going to suck more - at least they are playing better teams.

      So this weekend marked the much-anticipated Mike Tyson fight at Freedom Hall in Louisville. OH EXCUSE ME as the ring announcer and people who showed up it's LOUIE-VILLE....morons. Anyway, the fight was something that I don't think I can compare to anything else. It's by far one of the most exciting events I think I have covered yet. It's one of the most INTENSE events I think I have covered yet. There were a handful of VIP on hand...some that I saw were Mr. T, Jim Gray, Joe Nichols, Evander Holyfield, Derek Anderson - there were supposed to be other's...Alan Jackson, Shaquille O' Neil, Macy Gray - but I never saw any of them. The experience was something that I must confess did not come as easily as I thought it would. Boxing is not an easy sport to shoot. I have much love for Charlie, my AP buddy, who orchestrated the event, used to shoot all the fights in Atlantic City - needless to say he hasn't lost his touch - but my responsbility was to just run film (cards) back to the room for him and Tim Easley (AP out of Louisville) between all the chaos that occured. There wasn't a whole lot of chaos just a lot of running around, but at some point and for some reason I was stuck with a camera at ringside and were able to snap some shots off. I got some good shots from the flyweight fight...I don't really remember getting anything from the Layla Ali fight (Hey, just for the record and I'm not being a perv for those out there who are reading this - but for a boxer - she  is very attractive. Later I got to shoot the press conference in case anything went down and her before fight and after look are night and day.  She's just a beautiful person. I'd like to upload some pictures that I took, but I had to shoot on AP cards and a lot of my stuff is still on Easley's computer. He is however, supposed to make me copies (of the ringgirls) and send them to me later on. At some point I'd like to make a list of all the big things that I have covered. If I had to right now, Tyson would be at the top of the list. I've never shot a fight before, it was probably a once-in-a-lifetime experinece. Would I do it again? Hell yes.  I was glad that Cassie went with me. While she spent her whole day shopping, she was very useful or very helpful for the drive home. Bless her heart, she did a great job and I'm not saying that I would have fallen asleep - but - I did fall asleep and she drove home so in the end everyone was happy. She wasn't happy that i feel asleep, but who's keeping count Saturday night we went to see Anchorman - there was a preview for a movie that I reallly wanted to remember - but now I can't. HOWEVER, I was watching CMT yesterday and they are apparently coming out (well they aren't) with a movie called 'Friday Night Lights'. The movie has Tim McGraw in it. Not real sure if he has a leading role, but the movie itself looks really good. Sunday my folks, but more importantly, FERRIS B. came down....the day after our cubbies acquired NOMAH for Boston....So - it was a good weekend for me. Better than most have been in a long time and I'm still reeling from a good weekend. I'm rather giddy and giggly today. RIGHT! Wait till tomorrow, I know!
