      i saw some people that i liked just now.  one of them i can't see anymore, but the others are still quite close.  the first was the guy in the yellow shirt.  he walked like a kid 14 or 15 years old.  he was loose and unfocused and was smoking like he was proud of his cigarette.  he had a bounce and a slouch you don't see in white men his age.  he looked like he could still fuck well if he felt like it.    the other guy was a drunk.  we made eye contact as he was stumbling backwards to the curb.  he shuffled, took too many steps and caught himself before falling and then he saw me looking.  he thought he got away with it, but the truth was he was hurriedly trying to dodge a car that had no chance of killing him.  it must have felt pretty good to him though.  to dodge a car and the judgment of some square like that certainly would feel good.  i used to tell people that i had spilled gin on my clothes when i was inappropriately drunk in the middle of the day.  i thought i was hiding my drunkenness in this way.  it felt really good.

      brisket is delicious.  i love well-marbled meat.   urlLink fat  is lovely when its well distributed and not too chewy.  i get the feeling that some people avoid fatty meats for reasons that aren't directly related to their health.  of course the texture of a heavily marbled cut of flesh does take some getting used to.  but most of the times when I see someone turn down a lardy brisket, they do so with a level of disgust that doesn't quite match the situation.  i think that the look of the fat has something to do with it.  i think that eating so many processed foods has left some folks skittish about some homely looking foods.  i also think that fatty cuts of meat are seen as low class.  sad.  it must have sucked to be jack sprat.  he had a big fat wife and no luxuriously marbled meats.

      i wonder if  urlLink Douglas Hofstadter  is cool.  GEB sure is dorky, but you never know.  that is a pretty bad haircut though, and the achilles and the tortoise stuff is so incredibly smug.  he's probably not cool.  i bet he is pretty happy though.  annoyingly happy.

       urlLink these new army uniforms  are pretty sweet.  so futuristic and creepy.  i firmly believe that a military should look as creepy and frightening as possible.  the new camouflage looks so digital.  it looks like something from lawnmower man.  i hope we're going to start sending troops into environments where this stuff is useful.  those pockets look great too.  i used to have an old mannish coat with regular pocket and slanty ones like on the new unis.  those were good pockets.  i consider myself a bit of a pocket connoisseur.  i have worn otherwise uncomfortable or unfashionable garments for years strictly based on the pockets.  i don't know if that statement is true or not, but it felt like the right thing to say.  i am into pockets though.  it's just the whole wearing crappy clothes just for the pockets thing that i'm unsure about.  i just got on a roll and all of a sudden i was talking as if pockets were the most important features of clothes, which they may or may not be.  i'm not prepared to argue that either way.  i'm just saying that one would probably accept a robe of amplest measure and subtlest woof whether or not it has a place for one's phone.    those new uniforms are pretty nice.

      i think that i might like to have a drink this evening but i can't get this larry hagman ego death thing out of my head.  that's how he put it, "ego death".  i've never heard it put quite that well.  three things come to mind immediately.  the first is the  urlLink zero system  on the most earnest and fancy anime series i've seen - gundam wing.  it was meant to do just what maj. nelson described.  it showed the pilot their death to make them fearless.  the other two things i thought of are less dorky, but they also reek of shoddy mysticism.  in that old hendrix  urlLink documentary , one of his friends describes what he thinks hendrix's death was like.  he seems to be talking shit, but i listened and realized that what he was describing had happened to me.  the first time i was at speech camp i was lying in bed and i got to a point either physically or mentally or both, where i felt a though i could choose whether or not to continue living.  it was super fucked up, and i know it sounds like garbage, but it happened, and here was this drug addled hipster roadie, in a film from 1973, describing my experience exactly.  i tried to tell someone about this once and she freaked out.  she just got completely unreasonable.  "what do you mean you know what it feels like to die?!?" and so on.  i mean i suppose that's a valid question, but the level of anger and excitement was completely inappropriate.  anyhoo...  larry hagman has fucked up my head

      apparently zachary taylor spent the fourth of july eating bowl after bowl of cherries and milk in 1850.  he fell ill and died five days later.  cherries and milk...the phrase itself sounds somehow deviant to me.  i bet the milk was fresh and thick and temperate.  i'm also bothered that a president could just sit around eating cherries and milk all day.

      major nelson thinks that it would be greedy of him to take a liver.  probably it's greedy of anyone to take a liver.  he said he died before on lsd.  now he's not scared.  spooky.  next to these things is a cropped shot of hagman's head from the dallas era.  he's siting in a executive style leather chair in front of a large window smiling evilly and wearing a hat that doubles the length of his head.

      i cannot tell if i'm hungry.  i recently consulted my phone to see when i ordered that sandwich.  it's been five hours.  should one be hungry five hours after eating such a sandwich?  perhaps...but i am not sure.  and besides i can't tell if i'm hungry or not.  eating at this point would be a risk.  i could easily overeat and ruin any hope of drinking comfortably later this evening. that would be a tragedy.  all of this is further complicated by the fact that i really want to eat.  you see i was not completely satisfied with that sandwich.  it was tasty, and the bread was good, but it was not ideal and the last bite fell apart in my hand.  rebuilding at that point in the process was quite a hassle, and it prevented me from properly savoring the end of my meal.  maybe i'll go lie down.  i guess i could smoke a cigarette, but that really doesn't sound too appealing.  here's what i'll do...i'll drink a big glass of water.  i guess i could just eat.  fuck it, i'm gonna eat.

      sweet good lord i wish i could eat a chicken thigh in the car without any problems.  you get a two piece dark meat meal, you don't fuck aroud with sides, and of course you get two thighs instead of the thigh and leg.  but life...life is cruel to a driving gourmand, especially one who won't accept a lesser piece of the bird.  anyone who knows chicken knows to go straight for the thighs.  the problem arises when one can't keep their mitts of the meat.  you need to improvise, and you end up getting all filthed up.  i'm fucking so fucking goddamn hungry.

      i went borders trying to indulge my crush with larger pictures, but the only books they had were several kid's books and one by the  urlLink archaeological investigators  who may or may not have found her shoe.  what i wanted was some semi unseemly biography with lots of unconvincing tales from folks who claiming to have poked her.  i wanted one of those books with the twenty pages of glossies in the middle; candids of her entering and exiting restaurants with an unconvincing smile, uncomfortable in an evening dress.  lots of appealing mia farrowness.  what i got was a picture of her reconstructed skull.  the book right next to that one, however, was pretty good.  i ended up reading about 92 pages right there in the store.  it's another lost at sea sort of deal, and while the prose may seem irresponsibly florid at times,  urlLink this guy  has probably earned his indulgences.  i think i'm going to go back and read more.  but first i'll have to find some pants.

       urlLink amelia earhart  sure did look a lot like mia farrow, and she was five seven.  that is fantastic.  i guess they are pretty sure now about what happened.  she and noonan landed on gardner island, lived off a cache of goods from a shipwreck for a while, then just wasted away.  the people who eventually populated the place had all sorts of trinkets made from pieces of airplane metal.  i mean, if you gotta go...in the grand scheme of things it's not such a bad way.  i mean with the romance and notoriety and such, not so much the wasting away.  that would be pretty shitty.  i'm sure one would probably slip into some kind of delerium, and apparently they had booze from the shipwreck, but still, given the choice of a means for physical death, exposure would be low on my list.  i wonder if she and noonan got it on.
