       I looked around the room.&nbsp; Everything was as it always had been.&nbsp; The old gray chair still sat in the farthest corner of the room.&nbsp; The painting depicting autumn in the forest remained on the east wall. Even those pictures of long-dead family members were still there, standing upright.&nbsp; They looked grand in those pictures.&nbsp; There was just something about the photos taken from 1920s&nbsp;to the 1950s that really stood the test of time.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I got up not knowing where I was heading.&nbsp; All I knew was that I had to get out of that room for a bit.&nbsp; I felt sick inside.&nbsp; I didn't feel sick physically as much as I did emotionally.&nbsp; That dream had stirred me up.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   It's funny&nbsp;how an individual&nbsp;can simply pass off most dreams; then one comes along which the person can't shake.&nbsp; It stays with him or her, sometimes for days.&nbsp; That's the type of dream I had just had, the latter.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I remember the dream vividly.     &nbsp;   I woke up in that same chair I had just gotten out of and realized there was something very different about my living room.&nbsp; It was empty.&nbsp; It seemed that way at first at least.&nbsp; Then I noticed something.&nbsp; The portraits of the family members that rested on the mantle, they were turned face down.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I slowly walked over to the mantle.&nbsp; I was about to pick up the first portrait, one of my mother's maternal grandparents.&nbsp;Then I heard the door close, and people talking.&nbsp; It sounded like a man and a woman.&nbsp; Turning around, I saw them.&nbsp; There they were!&nbsp; My great-grandparents! They had their backs to me, but it was them.&nbsp; "Wow," I thought, "how can this be real?"&nbsp; But it had to be.&nbsp; They were right before my eyes.     &nbsp;   I approached them without hesitation.&nbsp; "Hello," I said. They didn't respond.&nbsp; They carried on their conversation.&nbsp; I rubbed my eyes.&nbsp; When I looked up again, the setting had changed.&nbsp; I was in their house,&nbsp;and they still stood their, talking to each other with their backs to me.&nbsp; It was their living room.&nbsp; Everything looked as I remembered it.&nbsp; I remembered it so well.     &nbsp;   I tried once again to make contact; no luck.&nbsp; I turned around and started walking towards the spare bedroom entrance, which was about&nbsp;ten feet away.&nbsp;I&nbsp;hadn't a clue&nbsp;why I was walking there.&nbsp;I noticed the door was closed.&nbsp; I knocked.&nbsp; It felt real. It was real.&nbsp; I heard a man say, "Hold on!"&nbsp; I replied, "No rush."&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Five seconds later, the handle turned and the&nbsp;door swung open.&nbsp; There stood a man of probably&nbsp;nineteen&nbsp;dressed in a nice early twentieth-century black suit and a derby hat.&nbsp; He said, "Hey Henry.&nbsp; How are you?"&nbsp; "I'm fine," I answered.&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp; It was a laugh that sounded faintly familiar to me.&nbsp; It was a unique laugh, very unique.&nbsp;I couldn't place where I had heard it before.&nbsp;He looked at me and said,"I was waiting for you, Henry.&nbsp; I was afraid you wouldn't show.&nbsp; Henry, good old Henry.&nbsp; My old chum.&nbsp; Come on, we have to hurry.&nbsp; Go take a look in the mirror before we go.&nbsp; You've got some hair sticking up in the back.&nbsp;I don't think the ladies will be too impressed."&nbsp; He nudged me in the ribs and headed for the door, laughing.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I walked into the bedroom that&nbsp;he had just walked out of and found a full-length mirror.&nbsp; Something was wrong, very wrong.&nbsp; That wasn't me.&nbsp; No, that wasn't me at all.&nbsp; My facial features were much different.&nbsp; That hair was not mine.&nbsp; I was a bit taller now.&nbsp; I was also dressed in one of those black suits.&nbsp; I stood there looking at myself, but it wasn't me physically.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I heard footsteps coming toward me rapidly.&nbsp; It was him again.&nbsp; He smacked the back of my head and pulled my hair down, all in one motion.&nbsp; He laughed again.&nbsp; "Henry," he said, "We must be punctual.&nbsp; No time for us to play in front of the mirror."&nbsp; He walked toward the door again.&nbsp; I followed him.     &nbsp;   We walked out the door and onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; I looked to each side.&nbsp; Giant elms hung over the street.&nbsp; There were great old homes on each side.&nbsp; I hadn't been here before, or had I?&nbsp; In a way, I felt that perhaps I had once known this place.&nbsp; A car&nbsp;drove by&nbsp;us, a very old car.&nbsp; I wondered like I had never wondered before.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   He was way ahead of me.&nbsp; He was obviously in a hurry.&nbsp; "Come on, Henry!&nbsp; Hurry it up, will you?" he shouted.&nbsp; I picked up my pace. I saw him turn right about fifty feet in front of me and approach a&nbsp;large white home.&nbsp; As I neared it,&nbsp; I realized that it was a Victorian home, white with green trim.&nbsp; There was a large front porch and there was a small&nbsp;group of people sitting on it.&nbsp; They were all dressed in early twentieth-century clothing too.&nbsp; That man was talking to them.&nbsp; Who was he?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Upon reaching the residence, I turned right and walked toward that porch.&nbsp; I felt so out of place, yet I didn't.&nbsp; I stepped up onto the structure hesitantly.&nbsp; "Come on, Henry!&nbsp; No need to be scared," he said,&nbsp; "I don't know what your problem is today, old boy."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I had a better look at them now.&nbsp; There was a middle-aged man dressed in what was probably his finest suit.&nbsp; It was jet black.&nbsp; Every suit I had seen thus far was black.&nbsp; To his right was a woman roughly his age or just a bit younger.&nbsp; She was all dressed up too.&nbsp; She wore a floral dress.&nbsp; The flowers on it were yellow and white, and the background was red.&nbsp; Sitting beside the patriarch and matriarch of this family&nbsp;were their children.&nbsp; The daughter was seated to her mother's right.&nbsp; She was probably seventeen or eighteen.&nbsp; Her face was hidden by her cloche hat.&nbsp; She seemed to have her mind on other things.&nbsp; She really paid no attention to my "friend" or me.&nbsp; The son was seated next to his sister.&nbsp; He&nbsp;looked out toward the street and&nbsp;paid us no mind as well.&nbsp;He was probably my age, nineteen.&nbsp;What a surprise; he was also dressed in a jet black suit.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   "So, James, what troubles your friend today?" the father asked.&nbsp; That was his name, James.&nbsp; I decided to speak up.&nbsp; "Oh, nothing much, sir," I interjected, "I'm sorry."&nbsp; "No trouble," he replied, "Now let's get on with business."&nbsp; Business?&nbsp; I decided to be quiet and listen so that I could find out more.     &nbsp;   "This just isn't working," the father continued, looking at James, "These cabinets you sold me, they're just not installed properly.&nbsp; I understand that you're trying to finance your&nbsp;journey through medical school, but you are going about it all wrong.&nbsp; Take it from a self-made man:&nbsp; Please your customers, and you'll find that in the end, things work out much better.&nbsp; Now the family and I are about to go out to dinner, so nothing will be done this evening.&nbsp; However, I want you here tomorrow morning at nine.&nbsp; Being an old friend of your father's, I trust that you'll rectify this problem for me."&nbsp; James, who had been looking down throughout the patriarch's little speech, raised his head and replied, "I'm very sorry, Mr. Berkley.&nbsp; I will fix this.&nbsp; It was just an honest mistake.&nbsp; You're cabinets will be in tip-top shape after I'm done."&nbsp; James then shook Mr. Berkley's hand and walked down the porch steps and back to the sidewalk.&nbsp; I followed.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I decided not to be so reserved anymore.&nbsp; As we walked down the street, I asked&nbsp;James where we were going.&nbsp; He said, "We're off to the docks, old pal.&nbsp;I'm sorry for taking you along with me to the Berkleys' home, but I figured I should just go ahead and get it over with now.&nbsp; After tomorrow morning, I won't have to deal with&nbsp;that screwy crew&nbsp;anymore.&nbsp; I should have found some other way to make money.&nbsp; I just thought selling cabinets would be easier than it really is.&nbsp; Oh well, I'll forget about it all for now."&nbsp; We walked down a couple of blocks, and then we turned right and went down a couple more.&nbsp; There was the lake.&nbsp; It was quite large.&nbsp; James exclaimed, "There's the gang!&nbsp; They're over there waiting for us.&nbsp; Come on, Henry, no time to waste!"&nbsp; He sprinted through the grass and towards the nearest dock.&nbsp; Sure enough, there was a group of people standing on it.&nbsp; They were all waving.&nbsp; I sprinted over too.     &nbsp;   I was&nbsp;beginning to notice that I had limited control over my actions.&nbsp; It was like I was inside another person, and I was just along for the ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;I felt that my speech was about&nbsp;all I could control. But then again, it seemed scripted somehow.&nbsp; Everything seemed predetermined.     &nbsp;   I was soon on the dock.&nbsp; I walked over to "the gang" and said, "Hello. How are all of you this evening?"&nbsp; Of course, I was bombarded with answers, but each&nbsp;response was either "splendid," "lovely," or "swell."&nbsp; I certainly wasn't accustomed to youth using such words.&nbsp; I took a look at this small crowd.&nbsp; There were seven of them (four women and three men), excluding James and me, and they all seemed to be about my age.&nbsp; It was as if a boat from 1920s Hollywood had dropped&nbsp;a group of young stars and starlets&nbsp;off on this dock.&nbsp; One girl bore a resemblance to Lillian Gish.&nbsp; One of the guys looked like Ivor Novello.&nbsp; The others brought famous faces to mind too.&nbsp; Of course, they weren't these stars, but they would have fit into the old&nbsp;silent films just fine.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   James asked, "Hey Howard, did you bring the drinks?"&nbsp; Howard was a tall kid, probably six feet tall.&nbsp; He had very dark, slicked-back hair.&nbsp; He smiled and said, "Of course, it's on the boat."&nbsp; He pointed behind him.&nbsp; There was a&nbsp;white sailboat there, probably twenty-five feet long.&nbsp; He then directed a question towards James and me, "Why are you two so dressed up?"&nbsp; I looked at James.&nbsp; James laughed and responded, "Oh, I thought we were all going out to dinner."&nbsp; The group laughed as if to say, "Who needs to eat when we can get drunk?"&nbsp; James started cracking up too, obviously a little embarrassed.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   They all filed onto the boat.&nbsp; I was the last one on.&nbsp; Then we set off. Everybody was talking and passing around&nbsp;a bottle of&nbsp;whiskey, me included.&nbsp; I was saying things that I wasn't thinking.&nbsp; Clearly, I had no control.&nbsp; After a couple of swigs, I had to stop.&nbsp; The whiskey was making me ill.&nbsp; I walked over and&nbsp;sat down at the&nbsp;front of the boat.&nbsp; Facing the group, I continued conversing with them.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Two&nbsp;or&nbsp;three hours&nbsp;passed.&nbsp; We were now in the center of the lake, and the sun was down.&nbsp; James was carrying on like a fool.&nbsp; The fact that they were passing vodka around now too didn't help matters.&nbsp; I was still sitting at the front of the boat.&nbsp; James came up to me.&nbsp; He had a cigarette in his mouth.&nbsp; He took it out and threw it into the water.&nbsp; Then he walked over to the railing and climbed onto it.&nbsp; He was yelling nonsensically.&nbsp; The gang was laughing at him.&nbsp; They were drunk too, of course.&nbsp; I was the only one who seemed concerned.&nbsp; "James," I said, "get off the railing."&nbsp; It was as if I said nothing.&nbsp; I didn't want to get up.&nbsp; I thought that&nbsp;the slightest&nbsp;movement could send him into the water.&nbsp; He was out of my reach.&nbsp; I repeated, but this time&nbsp;louder and with more conviction,&nbsp;"James, get off the railing!&nbsp; Come on, get off the railing!"&nbsp; Then he jumped, and everyone rushed to look.&nbsp; He was underwater, and he wasn't coming up.&nbsp; I wasted no time jumping in after him.&nbsp; Something told me I could save him.     &nbsp;   The water was cold, and I sunk into it just like he had.&nbsp; I struggled, and at the same time, looked for my drowning friend.&nbsp; Where was he?&nbsp; Clearly, he was sinking somewhere beneath my feet.&nbsp; I managed to slip my shoes off, which made&nbsp;things&nbsp;a little easier.&nbsp; I moved my arms and legs furiously to stay afloat, and then I dove.&nbsp; I couldn't see; it was too dark now.&nbsp; I felt for a body, but I grabbed nothing but handfuls of cold water.&nbsp; I had to go up for air.&nbsp; I returned to the surface and I yelled.&nbsp; I heard the cries and yells coming from&nbsp;the sailboat.&nbsp; I asked them to throw something down so I could stay afloat, and try to find James while they went back for help.&nbsp; But something told me it was much too late for James.&nbsp; He was at the bottom of the lake.&nbsp;I knew it.&nbsp;Then I asked them to throw me a line&nbsp;so I could&nbsp;get back on the boat.&nbsp; But they were moving away now.&nbsp; They had lifted the anchor, and were headed toward the shore.&nbsp; The drunk fools.&nbsp; They had&nbsp;left me here to die.&nbsp; I could have climbed the anchor line, but they were too wasted to think logically.     &nbsp;   The only way for me to stay above water was to move my arms and legs, and I did.&nbsp; After ten minutes, I was out of energy.&nbsp; They had only just reached the shore.&nbsp; The water was so cold now.&nbsp; I cried.&nbsp; The tears ran down my face like they never had before.&nbsp; I didn't want to die.&nbsp; I should've tried&nbsp;to jump&nbsp;for James before he went into the water.&nbsp; So many thoughts went through my mind.&nbsp; Then I sank.&nbsp; I remember that sickening feeling I felt as I struggled.&nbsp; I looked toward the surface, as it&nbsp;faded away ever so gradually.&nbsp; It was a sense of helplessness which can't be explained.     &nbsp;   Then it was over... but before I opened my eyes, a scene entered my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was&nbsp;a shaded hill with grave markers on it, a part of a cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;There were&nbsp;two large oak trees&nbsp;on that hill that really stuck out in my mind.&nbsp;If I saw those trees again,&nbsp;I'd recognize them instantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I woke up, and here I was now.&nbsp; I was about to go somewhere, but I didn't know exactly where.&nbsp;I got into my car and drove far, probably fifty miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a map in my head guiding me, but I couldn't see it.&nbsp; I finally came to a town called Winsington.&nbsp; I had never been here before.&nbsp; I had never driven through it.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I neared the downtown area, I saw a sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;had an arrow pointing right and the words "Winsington Lake" on it.&nbsp; I turned right.&nbsp; I kept driving until I reached the lake.&nbsp; This was the lake I had dreamt about.&nbsp; No, it couldn't be.&nbsp; It was just a coincidence.&nbsp; The docks weren't the same.&nbsp; They weren't where they had been in my dream.&nbsp; Then I thought about those people.&nbsp;&nbsp;They weren't modern people.&nbsp; They looked like&nbsp;individuals from eighty years back.     I got out of my car and went into the visitors building where it appeared individuals could rent boats to take out on the lake.&nbsp; I don't know why I went in.&nbsp; I didn't know why I was doing a lot of things.&nbsp; The room I walked into wasn't very big, so I noticed the photos on the wall right away.&nbsp; I walked over to them.&nbsp; There were several pictures.&nbsp; There appeared to be one photo&nbsp;from each decade&nbsp;of the past century.&nbsp; I worked my way down from the 1990s. Then I saw it.&nbsp; That's what I had seen in my dream!&nbsp; It looked exactly the same.&nbsp; It was taken in 1935.&nbsp; Then I saw the 1925 picture, and it looked like what I had seen in my dream as well.&nbsp; I wanted to tell myself it was a coincidence, but deep down I knew there was something to this.&nbsp;     A thought came into my head, but I figured I shouldn't&nbsp;do what it suggested.&nbsp; Then it crossed my mind again.&nbsp; Should I go to that old man at the desk and ask him if anyone ever drowned here?&nbsp; It seemed a bit grim, but I figured I had nothing to lose.&nbsp; I had come all this way.&nbsp; I should just put this thing to rest.&nbsp; I approached him.&nbsp; "Good afternoon, sir," I said.&nbsp; "Good afternoon," he replied, "may I help you with something?"&nbsp; "Yes," I said, "I know this is a bit of an odd question, but has anyone ever drowned in this lake?"&nbsp; He looked at me, obviously surprised.&nbsp; "Funny you should ask," the old man said, "If my memory serves me correctly, it's been eighty years this week since the only two drownings on record occurred here.&nbsp; I was a kid then, but I remember it.&nbsp; It was a big deal in this town.&nbsp; Two teenagers drowned.&nbsp; One jumped off the sailboat they were on, and then the other tried to save him.&nbsp;Everyone who was on that boat is dead now I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I heard, they all went to their graves&nbsp;with much guilt hanging over them.&nbsp; The kid who tried to save the other one, his death could have been prevented.&nbsp; He was still above the water, but his friends headed back to shore, leaving him to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;They initially blamed&nbsp;it on the&nbsp;booze they drank that night, but they&nbsp;later blamed themselves.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;believe any of them ever&nbsp;accepted it.&nbsp; It's a sad story."&nbsp; I stood there shocked.&nbsp; I was incredulous.&nbsp; I&nbsp;thanked him, turned around, and&nbsp;headed out the door.&nbsp; I took one more look at the lake, and then got into my car.&nbsp; I didn't like the feeling I was getting there.    I decided that I would try and find the town's cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;That had to be where those two were buried.&nbsp;&nbsp;I drove around for roughly a half an hour until I finally found it.&nbsp; It was nestled in the woods, on the outskirts of the town.&nbsp; It wasn't a big cemetery at all.&nbsp; It was hilly though.&nbsp; I drove up and down the hills, looking for those elm trees.&nbsp; Then I saw them.&nbsp; I parked the car and got out.&nbsp; I ran over to that hill and walked up it, examining each stone.&nbsp; For twenty minutes I looked and looked.&nbsp; Suddenly, I saw a stone with the name James on it.&nbsp; "James Edward Turner" it read.&nbsp; The date of birth was June 16, 1905.&nbsp; The date of death was July 28, 1924.&nbsp; It was him, no doubt in my mind.&nbsp; I stood there for a minute and took it all in.&nbsp; Then I continued searching for the other one, the one I had been.&nbsp; A few minutes later, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it.&nbsp; The stone read "Henry Gerald Thomas."&nbsp; Unbelievable.&nbsp; Absolutely unbelievable.&nbsp; The feeling that came over me at that minute can't be put into words.&nbsp; I looked at the dates of birth and death "May 28, 1905 - July 28, 1924."&nbsp;    I sat down on the grave for a few minutes, and closed my eyes.&nbsp; I saw nothing in my mind.&nbsp; There was nothing for me to say.&nbsp; I stood up and left.      &nbsp;
