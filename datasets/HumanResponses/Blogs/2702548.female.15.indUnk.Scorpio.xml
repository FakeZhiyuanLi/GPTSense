      Hey all I'm really tired and I'm sitting here in study hall checking up on my friends blogs. I just finished reading  urlLink Alex's blog  and I would like to say that I pretty much agree with what I read on there about the media today. Especially what it feeds to the girls of today. I mean I was at Easton and I saw a group of 10 year old girls in tub tops and tons of make up and if that doesn't show you the effect the media is having on girls today I don't know what will. I know that I sure won't let my little 10 year old going about in a tub top and make up looking a like a hoe! I mean seriously what has this world come to when every one is pressured to have sex of some sort even if it isn't "technically sex". News flash for you all it's sex. I have said this earlier when I talked about love or lust how most people today confuse them don't you'll end up messing up a part of your life that you can't get back! Just think about it.

      Great expectations is a dumb and worthless book. The ending bites and so does the rest of the book. Maybe I just don't have a fine taste for good literature or maybe I'm right and the book stinks. I finished reading it today in class and I was like we have spent the last two months of school reading Great expectations for what! A stupid ending and a bunch of vocab words I'll never use.  It's so frustrating.

      Hey all, last night I went to the Linkin Park, Hoobastank, POD, and Story of the Year concert and it was wicked awesome( hahaha). I went with Justin, Kylie , Alyssa, and Marie. The only band that really sucked was POD.  I bought this awesome Hoobastank shirt. YAY. We got home about 11 30, and since the roads were so bad everybody just spent the night. We started to watch The Labyrinth but people got tired so Alyssa went and crashed on the couch and Marie in the den. So Kylie, Justin and I went and talked in my sister's room where Justin was sleeping. We stayed up till like 3 30. I was a great time though. I think we are all really tired though so I'm going to go ill write later.

      I never got the point of learn Bible verses cause we don't remember them for the rest of our lives. I mean honestly kids learn them 20 mins before their test then forget them by next week. If I'm going to learn a verse I'm going to want it to be something that applies to my life or that speaks to me! Like right now my favorite verse is Psalm 119:66 "teach me knowledge and good judgment, for I believe in your commands." I think that this is a verse worth teaching cause it's simple but yet if you are a Christian it applies to your life in that you should want to do what is right in God's eyes.

       Friends  Friends, I think is it what  helps get or have gotten us through middle and high school.  Having good friends can be one of the most important things in someone's life. I mean if you hang out with the wrong set of people they could help in steering you down a path you don't want to take and pressure you into doing things you don't want to do.  I have an awesome set of close friends!! I mean Kylie is my number one girl and I love her to pieces and can tell her almost anything. Alex is my closest guy friends and I trust him and he trusts me and that is a very important thing with close friends. I mean honestly if  I didn't have my close friends I probably wouldn't be here right now. I mean that in all honesty. Kylie has helped me through so much stuff from school to boys and I feel kinda bad for her to have to go through all that stuff with me but she is my best friend and has always stuck by me. So I LOVE YOU KYLIE YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND EVER!!!!!  Richie is good when I need a laugh. He is a little insane at times but hey what can you do he is Richie. Well I don't know I have a lot of friends but I'm only writing about a couple today. I almost forgot one but yeah Renea she is my little friend and almost knows to much for her own good I sometimes think. I can trust her with stuff in all confidentiality. Ok I'm done later.

      Spiritually emphases week sucks!! I mean we have to go to chapel every day and the speaker this year isn't even interesting I'm sorry. I really haven't liked any of the chapels this year to be honest.

Well I'm going to go later

      I was watching Daria today. I love that show its soo funny. They were talking about Romeo and Juliet. Daria was teaching a class and one of the students was like you agree that Romeo was a crazy guy in tights who was stalking the girl he met at the party to then. I was just like that is just funny that anyone would think of the story in that way even though its a tragedy.

       Confession  Jeff talked about confession tonight at church. How we should not just confess to God but to other people the sins that we are struggling with. And as I was listening  I felt a strong pull to confess not really to people but just to God and just to be open with Him, even though He already knows about it. The reason I think God wasn't calling me to confess to people like Jeff had said to do was because He knew it was something I first needed to confess to Him. I think that He also knew I didn't really trust any of the people we were suppose to go and confess our sins to 'cause I don't really know or have a friendship with any of them. So yeah I think that what Jeff was teaching was a good concept but that it is not the only way God forgives or helps people heal. So yeah that's all I'm going to type on that.

       What is LOVE?    Love or Lust?  According to 1 Corinthians 13:5 love is not self seeking, is not rude, is not easily angered, and does not keep records of wrongs. So why in today's culture is "love" something some guys use to try and make there girlfriends have sex with them if its not self seeking? "ill know you really love me if you have sex with me" that's such bull that is self seeking and rude. So obviously its not the love the Bible is talking about! The "love" that is portrayed in America today is not love most of the time its lust! And its every where in the media. I watched 4 movies on Friday and every single one had a scene that was a sex scene or implied that the people had sex and almost every time after the people would be like "I love you". This makes me mad cause sex is something to be shared between two people who are married and only those people who are married. That's the way God intended it to be.    Like and Love two different things  When you love someone is unconditional supposedly. I mean kids my age sometimes do not like their parents but still love them all the same cause they are their parents. But that is a different type of love then "I love you" and even in that case I don't think that you always like the person. I mean I bet there have been times when my parents didn't like each other for things said or something done but they still loved each other. So when kids who date each other for like a week are like " I am so in love with him or her" its normally not true. I mean I would say that I am guilty of saying that before. But now that I have come to this conclusion I don't think I will so openly use the word love towards people. Except if I'm talking about the Christian sense of loving people in which we are suppose to love everyone like we love ourselves. But I'm defiantly going to think about it before I use the phrase "I love you" with some one again. Think about it  if you have any comments write me at punkchique53@aol.com later

      So hey I'm back again sitting in my study hall wear my pj's cause it's pajama day! Well this past weekend was a good one over all. Justin came to visit me on Saturday morning and we watched the labyrinth( that movie rocks) Fifle Goes West, and Romeo and Juliet ( the new one). We had a good time just chillin watching movies in the den. Then after he left my friend Emily called and we went to Kohls where I got her to buy this cute girly shirt which is a big accomplishment if you know Emily. After that we went out to eat and then to church were I got to see Alex!! I was really excited cause I hadn't seen him in like 2 or 3 weeks. Richie and my cousin started fighting and being dumb during the service and it got really annoying. The only bad part about that night was the fact that Alex was grounded so we couldn't go anywhere afterwards. But it all turned out to be ok I went home with my sister and we made cookies. We made lots of little heart shaped ones and then a big flower and a big shamrock cookie they rocked. On Sunday I went to VCDC and I had to be there at 8 20 ( grrr) cause my parents were playing on the worship team. After church I went home and ate lunch then my dad took me to the mall to get the final things for my HC dress. I got this rocken shoes for only like 16 bucks and a pair of fishnets. On Sunday night I went to worship practice and it was ok nothing special except for maybe watching the boys play Halo on the projector. hehehe well I'm going to go ill write later peace out.

       WINTER RETREAT  Hey I got back from the VCDC winter retreat today and it was awesome. I had so much fun. I loved just being able to hang out with all my friends and chill. We went sledding but I didn't stay outside to long I really wet when I wiped out. The worship was awesome and the food wasn't half bad either:0) One of the best times was when we tried to play hacky sack. It was hilarious we all were really bad at it. "All the hackies came out of the sack" Brandon We read this book called The Dream Giver and then discussed it instead of having a normal teaching session and I really enjoyed that even though at the end of some of the sessions I got a little insane and wouldn't sit down. I was kinda insane. The book was good and was talking about the dreams God has for all of us and how it is up to us to follow God and the dreams he has for us. And that he will help us when ever we need and call out for his help. Our group had a good talked and conversation about it from what I could tell when I was paying attention.   I got this really really cool green coat from Holly (she is one of the youth leaders at VCDC) for nothing so I gave her a new pair of toe socks cause she really wanted some. lol . I'll write later God Bless

Ok well yesterday lets see was pretty boring during the day, cause i didn't do much. That night was ok I went to church and Kylie and Alex were there which always adds up to being a good time. Alex got Kylie to eat ferilizer by telling her it was salt, it was a very mean thing to do if I do say so. Well yeah anyways after church I came home and had all these weird dreams.  The wierdest was I had to be Hilary Duff's voice over cause the director thougth she had a anoying voice and I also had to sing the theme song or soemthing it was strange. Yeah well there were a lot of them. who know I guess I just have weird thought. o well today was boring too I cleaned the basement. And listened to Lost Prophates, who ROCK I must say. ok later all much love

      Hey all!!!!!! Im sorry i haven't writen in forever. I have had so much going on between my past two projects. grrr Mrs.Johnson makes me so mad! her stupid assignment the 25 poems. Ok so besides that I got into my school play , which is The Adventures of Tom Sawyer the Broadway Musical. I play Amy Lawrence, Becky's best friend. I don't have a many lines. Today in school we watched a movie about bullies... it was interesting and was suppose to help us see what people do when they make fun of others in hope to change our school. But i know better than that cause ive heard it a million times but nothing ever changes. Like the main kid who picks on kids was making fun of the man in video afterwards which proves my point. ok well... change of subject. Justin and me are still going out and i know many of you will be like what happened to alex. well to be honest alex is still my best guy friend and i still love hanging with him and stuff.

      Why is it sometimes the hardest to differ between the truth and a lie about the people you think you know best? And why do you some times believe people you know are lying?

       STUPID RULES  On Friday I had to go to an assembly on PDA and how you shouldn't act in jest about homosexuallity. It was the most stupid thing i have ever been to in my life. we are now not aloud to hug anyone and you can't hold hands with anyone enless you are dating them and all this crap and i started thinking its normal for girls to give eachother hugs or hold hands just being friends or acting stupid it doesnt mean anything so Todd ( the man) is freaking out about such crap that doesn't make any sense at all. He is an insane sex freak in my eyes and i can't stand the sight of that man he makes me sick to my stomach. He is one of my many reasons i will probably leave tree next year. he considers him self to be all great and superior in everything to his students and crap. He always thinks that others are wrong and that he and his church are the only ones that are right. well ok back to my point.... as you can see i changed the title of my blog, and for all of you that are wondering why it manly has to do with my school and the way most of the world looks a teenagers.       They have this look as if we are left alone to make our own choices or do any thinking for ourselves we might destroy everything they have worked so hard to inflect upon us for the past years of our life. And most parents not mine either have no clue whats happening in thier childs life, dont care or think that they are having sex drinking and doing drugs and thats all. Parents talk about how tv effects our minds and how the media influences us, well a news flash to all of you it works on you too. Where else do you think you got the idea that your kids were doing all of those past things besides from maybe ur mistakes but even if not you still judge your kids or there friends based on words of mouth or just even taking a look at them. I mean i know a parent that just because some one has pierceings or tattoos and assumes that they are having sex and doing drugs just by looking at them. STOP ALREADY let your kids make there own choices for a while and test there judgement.  I bet most of your kids dont have that bad of it, Unless Candy is reading this then watch your son more carefully. Sorry Richie its true.              Ok back to the beging point people think that by setting the rules that they do on kids like Todd did on us that we will be better kids and obey them. The truth is most of the time the more you restrict your kids the more they want to rebel against the stupid rules that you try and stick on them. So try and trust your kids for a while and you might be suprised. And for all you people my age,  if your parents do give you trust dont let them down by doing totally stupid stuff. SMOKING is gross dont do it. ok im done for the day any comments email me at punkchique53@aol.com

       Keep it all to yourself     If you don't tell anyone anything you can't get hurt, right? Then you can be whoever you want. Do whatever you want.... But would it be genuine? Most likely not... But who cares right you can't get hurt.

      Friends people say are the most important thing a teenager can have in there life. So why is it that friends are normally what gets us down or hurts us? True the feeling of having no friends or none that you can trust can drive some people mad, but sometimes it's better not to share and to hid. The Worst feeling in the world is not knowing your "best friends" or having the feeling that they have been lying to you. These are the types of things that make people  like me depressed.

       Afraid Of Emotions     Why are so many people afraid to be nice, or show that they care at all? Not caring... My friend once told me the way to maintain your relationships with people was not to care, so then are they really relationships at all then? 'Cause if you don't care about what happens to those people or those relationships then its not really a relationship to begin with. I will admit that sometimes I care to much what is going on in my friendships and I let myself get carried away in it but I think that it can be better than not trying/caring at all. Think about it...

          I'm going to be working all summer apparently. First my three weeks as a nanny is Jaffery Center New Hampshire, then I might go and work for/with these artists that are friends of the family. My dad thinks it will be good for my college application and that I will learn a ton which i suppose to be true. Well I need the money so I'm not complaining. I hope to get my temps some time this month.....        On Friday I had a half day of school Jenny and Steve came over and we went down to campus. It was a pretty good time I got two new cds and a huge poster of Johnny Depp, which if you ask Kylie is a wonderful thing to wake up to in the morning.hahaha.         Saturday Kylie came over and we went to church. Then after went with Ed, and alex to see Van Helsing. Which is a horrible movie. The acting of the "evil creatures" is horrible and the music is just cheesy and in the wrong place. I was happy to have kylie over she hasn't been over in a long time to stay the night.YAY, for best friends.        Well my mind is a crazy place that I have decided needs to be cleared so before I leave for NH. Summer is a time for teenagers to breath, get a good long break, clear our minds and relax. Later

      Yesterday night was interesting to say the least...... I went out with alex and richie to the movies after church. We saw Godsend, which I think is a pretty good movie. Richie drove me up the wall the whole night i swear that kid is so anyoing sometimes( Richie i know you read this so personal note to you, that was one of the times you needed to control the things you were saying). But besides that it was a good time. Richie screamed like a girl, which was funny later
