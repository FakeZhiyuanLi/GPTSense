      Is it just me or do mini-van Moms tick you off? How many times have you been running late for some event and you pull up behind that one driver who for their own purposes, determines that you're too close to their bumper? So they pull a Gregory Hines on the brake causing you to slow down just below the speed limit and as soon as you think they're gonna catch back up with the flow of traffic, they hit it again, and again. Finally you get the scarce opportunity to pass, just to find miles of empty lane in front of them causing you to wonder, "Why the h*ck is this happening to me?"

      So last night I went to dinner and a movie with a couple guys from my district at work. The movie--Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. 3.5 of 5 stars in my opinion. Anyhow after tossing around several restaurant names, we ended up at Fazoli's(a fast food Italian joint) who's breadsticks rival if not conquer those of Olive garden. Well, as we stood in line waiting to place our orders, there was an employee behind the counter who appeared to be somewhat frustrated with the way "his" night was going. Although it was quite entertaining, this individual was essentially throwing a temper-tantrum and showing out in front of the customers which is probably not that good for business. The guy had to be in his late thirties so I can understand his self-disappointment at being "Breadstick Boy", but his Diva attitude was almost enough to make me lose my appetite. While making his rounds later on it seemed as though he had gotten himself under control(maybe went out back and had a good cry) until he served us our 2nd helping of breadsticks after which he huffed off mumbling something along these lines..."I can't believe my basket is empty 2 tables into the dining room"... On our way out he was hurriedly refilling his basket, half destroying the breadsticks with his tongs. We got to the theater an hour early so when we went in, it was pitch black. However, I just happen to have a keychain flashlight that illuminated the whole theater. We made our way to our seats and played games on our cell phones to pass the time. Suddenly we heard some more people coming in talking about how dark it was. Blackout. We closed our phones and killed the keychain light. It sounded like little kids that weren't gonna walk any further than the front row. Out of nowhere I hear one of the guys making haunting ghost sounds. Those kids were GONE like the wind!

      I really don't like my job right now. You see, a couple of months ago I was transferred against my will, to a place I can't stand.  &nbsp;I've spent the rollercoaster that is my career struggling to make a better existence for myself. For the last 10 years I have worked in the blue collar side of property management.  I started out as a groundskeeper for an aging apartment community on the north side of town.  ghetto!  Excuse me. Groundskeeper is the polite way of saying Trash-picker-upper-er. As I learned more of how to fix things and aquired some of my own tools, I was quickly promoted to Maintenance Technician. This worked out nicely for me as I was 19 and making $7.hr. good money for the time, especially for a kid just out of high school. After about 2 years of good service, a co-worker and I both decided that we wanted to make a move up. We both applied at a luxury apartment community on the east side(much closer to home for me) and we both got hired immediately.  That was&nbsp; great while it lasted. The place was much newer and the clientelle much richer. One experience&nbsp;I remember vividly is tracing, cutting out, painting, and assembling 4 wooden reindeer and a miniature sleigh. There was so little work to do that we spent a great deal of time shooting the breeze with the boss in our garage/shop. I guess that's why only 4 months in the new company transferred me to a property in greater need of competent staff.  My third place, much like the first, ghetto! I'm sorry, there must be a draft in here... No shortage of work there. This stage in my career is where&nbsp;I learned the most, I became a real MacGyver so to speak. You've got a problem? I'll solve it. Check out the beat while the d.j. resolves it. was my attitude. Well, soon enough the opportunity presented itself for me to get the h*ck outta dodge&nbsp;to a nicer, newer property&nbsp;managed by&nbsp;the same company.  Sweetness!!! An upscale neighborhood easy to work on and when I got married in '98, we got a huge discount on&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment there. Things were looking great and occasionally they would send me to help out at some less than desirable communities, but I retained my spot at that place for nearly 3 years.  Then, at the dawn of the new millenium, my dream job! January 3rd, 2000 I took a position based out of the corporate office, along with which came a company van, gas card, cell phone, responsibility, and best of all freedom. I was partially responsible for around 1000 units located everywhere in the city and surronding suburbs. Not just aparments but split-doubles/twin-singles, condos, and huge single family homes.&nbsp;Plus&nbsp;I got to drive around for the majority of the day, here and there, to and fro, and get paid well&nbsp;for it. Loving my job for the first time in my life... until...you can hear the scary music (dunh dunh duuuuuuuunh!). The district manager called me a few days before Thanksgiving for a "meeting" during which she informed me that "Effective Monday, you'll start at 'such and such property', they really need your help over there". My chin needed figurative stitches, my jaw hit the floor so hard. "What Bull-Poopie!", I thought. "I'm just now familiar with the routes, the parts, and the&nbsp;paperwork. Who in their right mind would uproot me now?"&nbsp;Monday came and I relinquished my keys phone and gas card, and made my way to my new home property. Located just minutes from the airport  ghetto! and aptly nick-named "Oozy-Alley"&nbsp;, this&nbsp;next stop on&nbsp;the line gave me a chance to exercise my supervisorial skills.&nbsp;Staffed with 2 employees, 1. a guy 3 times my&nbsp;age who had never done maintenance before, and&nbsp;b. a 19 year old&nbsp;guy from south of the border. I'm&nbsp;not sure to this day how much&nbsp;he understood of what I said. Like, "Work starts at&nbsp;8 a.m." and "You can't sleep in the common entrances." and "Stop going home in the middle of the day." He's the only guy I ever enjoyed firing.&nbsp;You may wonder, if you've read this far, who my replacement was in&nbsp;my prior cushy position. It seems they had no trouble finding someone on short notice. The district manager's husband was looking for work at just the right time. My understanding&nbsp;of company policy on relatives working&nbsp;directly in the chain of command must have been wrong.&nbsp;After 4 1/2 years with the same company, that slap in the face was the last straw so I began to actively seek new employment.  A job fair was my foot in the door with my current employer. I took a mainenance&nbsp;test, missing the 1 question on which I changed my answer from the correct one&nbsp;to a second guess. Then immediately had an interview with the V.P. She offered me a job on the spot.  Back to the top of the pile.  &nbsp;I started a 3 and a half year tenure at an upscale community where I chose to fly under the radar and stay out of the eye of the&nbsp;big-wigs so as to secure my place as a cornerstone at this one property and not get shuffled around. Successful at doing so, I saw many others come and go, but I remained. Until recently...  As a result of restructuring within our division, beginning in March we've implemented zone maintenance coverage, which means less individual attention on the property level and more of a focus on the district level. By doing this they effectively eliminated all&nbsp;property level supervisors. Subsequently they appointed a "lead tech" on each site. I became one of them. Thus added responsibility, and stress with no additional compensation. As the newfound pressures wore on us it showed. With trouble elsewhere in the zone and&nbsp;our already understaffed status, the poop hit the fan when one of our own was injured by a circular saw. Change became inevitable, but why did it have to include me? One of a handful of solid dependable techs in the district, comfortable right there in my own little corner of the world, I was ripped from my warm environment and thrown out in the cold all alone. Though I fought it tooth and nail, with every valid reason why I should stay, they chose not to hear or care.  So here I am now at a property just over a year old, only 254 apartments, a 15,000 gallon pool, and a mini-gym. Sounds great right? Here's the catch. This brand new property was built as a neighborhood improvement project.&nbsp;A pet project of the Mayor of our fair city. The problem, as I see it is that his logic is flawed. -- Let's build a brand new apartment complex in a well established ghetto! part of town and hope it spreads it's newness and goodness like a virus to the surrounding community. NOT! But it does have quite an appeal for the nearby residents. They're really trying to get in. As a matter of fact they're breaking in! In my first 2 weeks, I replaced 3 front doors. Did I mention that this place is a stones throw from where I started in the industry?  Enough for now. More updates will surely follow.

      If you were to zoom in on my profile pic, you'd see that the speedometer is pointing to 75m.p.h. The pic was taken on our 12 hour drive back to Ohio from Kiawah Island, SC. last summer. We covered over 700 miles one way. That trip is when I was introduced to Burger King's Icee/Soft-serve float. Quite possibly the world's best tasting frozen beverage. You may also note that no matter what I start out talking about, I will&nbsp;ultimately relate each good experience to food. Coincidentally, if I'm giving directions to someone, most all the landmarks&nbsp;employed will be restaurants.

      Finally did some more with this whole blog dealy. Set up a photobucket account, and an Audioblogger account. That looks like it might&nbsp;be just my steze. Now another post.

      My wife went to Wal-mart the other day, and after she had picked up a few items that we needed, she headed to the checkout lanes. There she saw a woman  pushing an overfilled cart while holding a stack of DVD's. You'd think this would be frustrating enough, but she also had 5 children running about, misbehaving. Apparently distracted by the children, she mistakenly had gotten in one of the  U-Scan  self checkout lanes. Immediately everyone behind her let out a unison sigh of disgust. Then she proceeded to check out in the "12 items or less" lane, completely oblivious of her offense. My wife quickly jumped into another lane and was out in a flash but couldn't help but notice the lady's struggle. If you've ever used a  U-scan , you know how sensitive the scale can be, resulting in you being asked to "Please remove the last item and scan it." then "place the item back in the bag." Her kids were running around and messing with everything in sight so the problem compounded. She had to stop what she was doing every 5 seconds to yell at the kids, making her take even longer. As far as we know, that lady might still be there.

      The weather was awesome when I got home tonight. Everything was neat and tidy at my house, even the bathroom rugs. The feel of those freshly washed rugs to my feet felt so wonderful. My wife takes such good care of me. She picked up a couple kinds of snacks today while grocery shopping and I probably ate half a bag of this cheddar cheese snack mix while I played ESPN 2K5 this evening. That was fun. We had a little bit of a tiff but then we talked about it for an hour or so along with a bunch of other stuff. My Son pooped twice since I got home. The second time, he and I went through our little pre-bedtime ritual. I change his diaper, then he asks for "Pink Yotion". We do his back, front, arms, legs, and feet. Yes I tickle those feet every time and he loves it. Finally we put his Jammies on and he runs off to play. Now (obviously) I'm blogging, and Mommy went to bed. Hopefully tomorrow will be a relaxing day. Sunday we're going to Red Lobster again, this time with other family members to celebrate our anniversary. Maybe someone will try that  urlLink Lobster Mac & Cheese.

      We have a particular resident who regularly calls in nonsense service requests and today's was no exception. It seems as though she has paranoia of some kind as indicated by the post-it note on the inside of her front door that says "Gotcha!" She also claims that someone referred to as "they" enter her apartment and "do a number" in the toilet, causing it to back up. In addition to that, her furnace supposedly "spits out particles all over the place" It got so  bad  she went and stayed in a hotel last night. So I went over and turned the water back on to her toilet, that she had shut off, so it would flush. Then I replaced her furnace filter, which didn't need replaced. This was the second time I had looked at the furnace "problem". The first time, she was showing me areas where the "particles" were on the carpet. There was nothing wrong with anything! Nothing on the carpet, No smell, No nothin'! Then she asked me to help her put on her bracelet. I did, and she asked me to help her with her necklace. I did. That was soooo uncomfortable! I immediately went back and told my manager that I was never going in that apartment alone again. So today while I was in that apartment alone again, the lady started pointing out the granules that "they" had left inside the back of her toilet, and as I was trying to leave she said, "There's that stuff that comes out of the windows when I leave" "That's why I wear my coat" "I don't suppose there's anything you can do about that is there?" I said, "I'm not sure" she said, " I didn't think so". Man she weirds me out.

      Well, my supervisor is coming out on Monday to help move the refrigerators around. I put hinges on the list of things to order. I picked up a lot of the trash, put away the shipment of parts I received, and my glass order arrived in the afternoon. I had to go to the  urlLink Crazy Lady's  apartment a little after 4.

      It's Friday. I have a lot to do today. I worked on the pool this morning for like an hour. Gotta get it prepped for the weekend. I might end up moving a couple refrigerators around by myself this afternoon. Then there's a door I have to hang, but I have no hinges in stock. There is trash all over the place, I need to put away the parts order, and I'm expecting a glass delivery sometime too. The last 2 service requests I went on both need warranty work scheduled, so I need to make a couple phone calls. That's all for now. Maybe I'll blog again later to tell how things turned out.

      Tonight we ride! Most every Tuesday night, I go out for dinner and an activity with my Dad. Ever since my Mom died suddenly back in January, I've made a great effort to spend more time with my Dad. Maybe this is selfish on my part, but he and I have never been really close, and I'm at least making an effort to change that. In recent weeks, my friend Mark has been coming along with us, adding a lot more hilarity to the outings. Several times we've gotten together with my Father-in-law and Brother-in-law(s) for group movie viewings. Those are always good, even if the movies are not.  Tonight, we're headed to Skyline Chili for some coneys, then back to Mark's to watch the 2 hour finale of Last Comic Standing 2. It'll be greeeaattt!

      On occasion, I'll be reading email, surfing the web, or typing away on my blog, as I was tonight, and my son will meander in the room lugging a book. I always stop what I'm doing, pick him up, and have some one on one time with him. Usually we read about Dora the Explorer. Tonight he toddled in holding his  Precious Moments  Bible, saying Daddy, Daddy, unna wead da book! He sat on my knee, content as could be while I read Genesis 1 to him, then we went and got some chocolate milk. What a privelege!

      That just sounds wrong! Lobster is like $12/lb. and they're mixing it with macaroni, which is $1 for 5 boxes. Who's the Ad Wizard that came up with that one?     Anyways, we went out to Red Lobster for our Anniversary tonight and our bill with a 33% tip came to $16. Then we went through the drive through at DQ cause she had been craving a Mocha Moo Latte, and I tried the Brownie Batter Blizzard. It was da BOMB! I'm not very much of a choc-o-holic but it was very delicious.

        Kevin James' comedy special is playing right now on comedy central. I was flipping through and there he was just minutes into his act. For some strange reason I can't seem to turn the channel. His comedy is addicting! Even though we've watched him who knows how many times, and I own it on DVD, here I am watching it again. Great Stuff!    p.s. Here's that comparison you asked for. I threw it together tonight; I threw it together tonight, as a matter of fact... It's an old pic of me so I had to shimmy her in with Photoshop.

      I have been unable to post to my blog for a couple days now. Not for the lack of trying though. About 100 times I tried logging in and it was like the page just reloaded with my username and password still in place. My first thought was to clear my blogger cookie in I.E.6. I've been having problems off and on with Internet Explorer, so I decided to make sure I had all the latest updates from Microsoft. While those were downloading, I read some of the help info on the blogger website, and decided to give Mozilla a spin. Well after downloading and installing it, I fired up foxfire and proceeded to the login page. Same problem. So for good measure, I cleared everything.(cookies, cache, history, saved passwords, and auto form stuff) Tried again and here am. Go figure.

      50% chance of showers they say. How about 100% chance that I'm going home wet. That's more like it. Immediately after I loaded all my supplies and tools into a unit I was working on today, the skies went very dark. Moments later... cats and dogs. At this point here are my choices. 1. stretch out the work I have to do in there and stay inside all day. 2. Pray for a few moments of clear sky at just the right time so I can remove all my stuff and get the trash thrown out. Or C. sack it up and embrace my ringing wet destiny.

      One week and counting till my 6th anniversary and being the dutiful husband I am, I have no concrete plans. I suck. We bought a dining room set 3 months ago that is supposed to be our anniversary gift to one another, and we're saving money up to spend on a cruise in October, but it still seems like I shoud have something planned. I'd love to sweep her off her feet and wisk her away for a romantic weekend stay in a cottage somewhere.  I read online that the traditional gifts for this anniversary are iron and sugar.  Suggestions welcome.
