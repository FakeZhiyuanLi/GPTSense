         I   haven't posted in 9 days...so I actually have some things to say.  I just got back from the drag races.  Tonight was "Thursday Thunder" at the local strip, and it was nothing but street legal rides.  I loved it.  We pulled up to the ticket stand and the guy asked us if we were racing tonight.  As it turned out, ANY street legal car could race for $10.  There were Mustangs, Camaros, Firebirds, Foci (more than one Ford Focus), a couple Imprezas, a Celica or two, some Corvette ZO6s, an Evo, a Dodge Challenger, a Yamaha Warrior, a Suzuki motorcycle (that ran the 1/8th mile in 7.2 seconds at 109 mph), and many others (including a Dodge Shadow, some Chevy S-10s, and a Scion xB...which sucked.)        One of the coolest was simply called the "Grocery Getter." It was an 80s model station wagon that burned every other car there.  It ran the 1/8th somewhere in the 8s at 92 mph.  No V8 or turbo/nitrous equiped car could touch it.  It was pretty funny.      Then, they had a jet dragster there.  This thing was amazing.  It ran the 1/8th in 3.6 sec at 207 mph.  The driver was a 21 year old female.  Now, girls are awesome...and racing is awesome...but a girl that goes over 300 mph in a quarter mile is wicked.      School starts in a week...and I am still "car-less."  I'm really starting to worry, as I do not want to ride the bus again if I can help it.  I thought I had one, though.  There was a nice 1998 Dodge Neon Highline Sport (That could probably contend with some of the rides at the strip), but it was sold before we could buy it.  I'm going to keep looking, but I'm biting my fingernails now...      I got Alter Bridge's new album "One Day Remains."  Those guys are great, much better than Creed, in my opinion.  I'm glad they dropped Stapp's ass and decided to let their heavier side come out.  Good decesion, guys.      Well, I think that's enough for now.  I'll try not to go another 9 days without posting.  Talk to you later.

         F  or my tenth post, I have nothing to say. The past few days have been rather boring. I DID receive my "Van Halen: Guitar Anthology Series" tab book. Man, that thing is huge. It's about 240 pages, with guitar tabs for 30 of their songs. The only problem is that I can't play 1/4 of that stuff. EVH is too amazingly awesome for me. Oh well, maybe when I get better...      I also played through Call of Duty...again. It's a fun game, especially when you're a Russian, because then you get to see your "comrades" get shot by their friends for retreating and being a "traitor to the motherland." Good stuff.      That's pretty much it. Damn, I have to find more things to write about.       Talk to you later.

         T  oday was a relief compared to yesterday.  We didn't do any tree cutting, and there is even talk of leaving the trees as they are.  That would definately make me happy.  What we did do was pick up our lawn tractor.  After getting it last night, Dad left it at my grandma's house (he was going to a speedway in the same town and didn't feel like taking the trailer all the way home, then driving all the way back).  Dad and I drove to Grandma's to pick up the trailer and tractor.      We got there and she had lunch ready for us.  We had meatloaf, green beans, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, cole slaw, tomatoes, and bread.  Your classic "lunch made with Grandma's love".  It was great.  Afterward, she wanted me to help her with her computer.  You know, those new-fangled counting machines.  She has a photo editing program and hasn't the slightest clue how to operate it.  I took my time and explained everything to her, which took about 45 minutes.  It didn't help that she lacks the steady hand required to double-click.      Now, on to the mower.  It's a Murray (Performance division) with a 17.5 hp OHV engine in champion red.  It's considerably smaller than our old Murray, with a 42" blade span, instead of a 46".  However, it is more nimble and has a much smaller turning radius.  Plus, you can't go wrong with independant front suspension.  Not a bad mower at all, if you ask me.      Dad and I called about a white 1997 Ford Thunderbird LX.  I liked it pretty well, except for the 3.8L V6.  It only produces 145hp, and with a car that heavy, you need a V8 to feel the acceleration.  I'm going to pass it up.  I am getting a little desperate, though.  I'll take either a Dodge Avenger or a Chrysler Sebring now, or anything that comes along and I like well enough.  I don't want to have to ride the bus to school anymore, but have 2 weeks to find a car.  Wish me luck, because I'm going to need it.      Thanks for reading.  Ya'll come back now, ya hear? ...what the hell am I saying...

         T  oday was tiring to say the least. There is this tree (or rather "trees") on our property that is literally two trees connected at the stump. Dad decides it's time for them to come down, as one tree is leaning toward our house, and the other is leaning towards the neighbors'. This tree felling was no easy task, however. Dad had to climb the tree with the chainsaw, cut branches as he went, then tie a huge-ass rope to it near the top. He then cut below the rope and had me pull the top of the tree down with the Jeep, as the other end of the rope was tied to the hitch.     After the top of the tree was down, Dad and I cut it up into smaller, more burnable pieces and dragged them down into the brush pile. Once that was done, the process was repeated for a second time. After 5 hours of labor, the tops of both trees are gone, but the large trunks still remain. That's tomorrow....       Why do I hate trees? Not because of all the work involved in cutting the bastards down, it's the fact that they seemingly have a personal vendetta against me. When we were dragging the limbs to the pile, the entire tree top fell on me. All I heard was a loud cracking noise, then I tried to run away. However, I wasn't fast enough to keep the tree from slamming into my right shoulder. I got a few cuts and scratches, and it is a little sore. Damn tree, I didn't even cut it down, Dad did. From now on, the only time you'll see me hugging a tree is if I'm trying to shimmy up it to cut it to the ground. It wasn't SO bad, as our neighbor did help with the clean up. Unfortunately, he is 85 and could only do so much. He did let us use his lawn tractor and cart...as ours is of course dead.      On the subject of Murray...there will soon be a new Murray. Dad and I took the busted tractor to the Wal-Mart where we bought it and told them what happened with it. The guy drove it around for a little bit and could tell something was wrong, so he told us to leave it at Wal-Mart and he would call us when it was fixed. However, on the way home, the guy calls Dad and says that he will just give us a new mower. What the hell? Alright...whatever, I wasn't going to argue about it. But, we should have the new Murray tomorrow. I'll be sure to inform you all about the mower when we get it, as I'm sure you are all enthralled.    The day got better when I went down to my aunt's house and played PS2 with my cousin. We played some  Need for Speed: Underground  and  007 Nightfire . Then, when I got home, I continued working on "Fade to Black" by Metallica for the guitar. I've got the intro and intro solo pretty well. I can play the other parts, it's just a matter of fine tuning my movements to keep the pace. I'll have it soon.    Well, until next time, good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.

         T  oday was a busy day for me. My sister, my niece, and I went to McDonald's to have lunch. Then, we headed over to Wal-Mart to buy groceries, and then to the mall so that my sister could buy her mother-in-law a gift certificate for her birthday. On the way home, my niece (who is 7 months old) just started screaming and crying for 20 minutes. It was nerve racking.      After the trip with my sister, my mom and I went BACK to the mall to shop for me some school clothes. We bought four shirts and two pairs of shoes, considering that this weekend is tax-free for back to school. However, three of the four shirts didn't fit. I hated that, as the three coolest ones (One with Jimi Hendrix, one with a Mustang Mach 1, and another with a GTO) were the ones that didn't fit. Anyway, I got two pairs of New Balance 574s (black and grey) and a Ralph Lauren shirt out of it.      That's all for today. Be back tomorrow.

         H  ey. Welcome back, or if you've never been here before, leave while you still have the chance. I solved my little "Panama" problem: I bought a book off of Amazon.com. It has the guitar tabs for 30 of Van Halen's songs, including "Panama." Now, I just have to wait until Monday to be shipped the book and I can learn the entire song, plus several other ones. The book was only $17, which is a good buy if you ask me.      And, through some divine intervention, Murray is alive again...well...it was for a little while at least. We just started it up tonight, like it was nothing. It still has it's problems, but at least it ran long enough so that we could mow the grass. The strange thing is that Murray died again RIGHT after we finished. I mean, at the entrance to the building we store it in. Weird. Just more proof that there is a God, I suppose.      That is all for now. Catch you later.

         I   finished  Man's Search for Meaning  today. That's a relief. Apparently, the meaning of life is: "taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual." That's it. Just read my post and skip the book.      I went to guitar lessons today. I started to learn "Panama" by Van Halen. If you haven't heard it (which is unlikely if you are a rock fan), you need to. The only problem is that my instructor, Travis, will be gone next week so I can't learn the rest of it for two weeks. Plus, the tabs on the Internet for this song don't follow his method. Let's see...what would Frankl have me do? I have to take the responsibility to find the right answer...I've got it. I sit on my ass and weep for two weeks. Thank you Viktor, you are the coolest German, Jewish logotherapist I know.      That's all for now. I'll be back tomorrow.

          H  ey, welcome back. Today was the standard Tuesday for me: boring as hell. Tuesday sucks because it's not the first, most dreaded day of the week, and it's not the most celebrated day. It's not even the middle of the week. At least on Thursday you can look forward to Friday. Tuesday is a meaningless day, in my opinion.      What I did do was play some more billiards. I'll have you know that I broke my personal 9-ball record: I pocketed the 9 ball on the break. I was pretty happy about that.      Since Murray is dead, I tried to resurrect the ancient Murray in our shed that hasn't been turned on in three years. Of course, it was dead too. I've come to the conclusion that our back yard will never be mowed and that we'll just have to live with a small jungle.      Nothing else to report. Maybe hump day will be better. Later.

         I   spent most of today reading  Man's Search For Meaning . The more I read it, the more interesting it becomes...as far as psychology books go, at least. Frankl suffered in a German concentr I ation camp. It was there that he claims to have discovered the meaning of life: love. I'm about half way through it, so we'll see how the rest of it goes.      Other than reading, I played a little bit of billards today. I'm getting to be pretty good at it.  Today, I played my best game of 9-ball ever. I made the break, then hit the 1 ball into the 9 ball, which then fell into the corner pocket.  One shot after the break is my new record.  News on Murray, my lawn mower: It's dead. We put in a new spark plug and it won't even spark now. We're going to have to send it to someone who can fix it, as it must be an internal problem. Dad said that I should use the push mower and mow the back yard. Yeah...I don't think so. I don't feel like taking several hours out of my day just to mow grass.  Car news: A dealership 20 miles from home has a red Avenger for sale. It's got everything I'd want (automatic transmission, CD player, power everything, premium wheels, etc.). There is just one problem...it's got the 2.0L 4-Cyl. engine that produces 140hp. I think I'll just wait for the V6.  That's all for now. Talk to you later.

           H  ey, welcome back. Today started as a usual Sunday for me: I got up, had some breakfast, and mowed the front lawn. However, Dad asked me to mow the back lawn, as well (which is no small feat, considering our back yard is about an acre of grass). I complied...but only for a short time. The 'ol Murray was having trouble running.  We had had this problem before and we wrongly assumed that replacing the fuel line connector did the trick. So, Dad proposed that we buy some Super gasoline from Speedway and replace it with the gas in the mower already (he thought that the gasoline may have been mixed with water). That didn't work.  So we tried taking off the air filter, as it was considerably dirty. Nope, no effect. It must be the carburetor, right? We sprayed some Carb Cleaner directly into the carburetor...nothing, it was still idling hard and would sputter and stall. Next, I drove over to KMart to get some fuel injector/carburetor cleaner and we put that in the gas tank. Did it work? The damn thing wont even start now. I have no idea what's wrong with Murray. I'm frustrated as hell, though.  Anyway, I did get around to starting my book for AP English next year. I have to read  Man's Search for Meaning  by Viktor Frankl. Ever read it? Good, don't. It is so boring, I was about to fall asleep reading it, and I had just woken up. It's a damn psychology book...and we're reading it for English...go figure. Oh well, it's fairly short (under 200 pages). I'll just have to suck it up and drink some Sobe or something.  News on my car: Dad said he saw a blue 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser for sale at around $6,500. However, it had 98,000 miles on it. No way, I'm going to keep looking. My friend Chris said that he is going to sell his 1991 Chevrolet Corsica LT and buy his relative's 1997 Pontiac Grand Am GT. Now, I wouldn't mind having a Grand Am...oh well, I'll just have to find something better.  My mind changes so often about what car I'm looking for. As of now, I want a Dodge Avenger, or maybe a Chrysler Sebring (as they are practically the same car). I love the way the Avenger looks, it reminds me of a love child between a Viper and a Stratus. Plus, a 2.5L V6 with 163hp isn't too bad. It's probably the most I can afford (price of car, gas money, insurance), while still having a cool car.  That's it for now. Talk to you all later.

          W  ell, it's time for a blog. I don't know why, but it is. Hell, everyone else is doing it, why not me? Maybe because my life is uninteresting and uneventful. Anyway, you have been warned, as my blog title suggests.  In case you were wondering (which I'm sure you weren't), my title does come from a Van Halen album. They are my favorite band and I wanted the title to reflect both my interest in them and rock music in general.  Fair Warning  was the best choice, I think. It was either that or  For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge , which I found to be a little too dirty.  I'd like to start this blog by giving you an overview of myself. I am a 16-year-old male from West Virginia. My passions are my electric guitar and my car (which I don't own yet). I'm single...and always have been...and probably will be for some time. I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong: I am  NOT  gay. No chance in Hell. I don't know what it is, maybe I'm afraid of commitment, maybe I'm waiting for the perfect girl...probably a little of both. Anyway, I spend most of my time on the computer and playing my guitar. I hope to someday be in a rock band. I hope that day comes soon. I'm studying to become a doctor (if my band doesn't end up hitting the big time), and doing pretty well in school. Top of the class and 4.0 GPA, my entire life...and yes, I would like a medal.  I hope you enjoy my blog and I promise to make it as interesting as I possibly can. However, I am not making any promises. Thanks for your time. Talk to you soon.
