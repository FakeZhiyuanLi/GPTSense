      Hey everyone!!! =) how is everyone? I'm ok, being killed by mosquitoes as you read x_x. So far I've not been very bored, I've always found stuff to do, and being behind a computer is NOT one of them, which explains why I took so long to put up another post. From now on, I'm afraid I'll update with much less frequency. Another reason for this is that I'm on my cousin's computer, and the keyboard is numbmingly horrible&nbsp; to use, and the monitor sucks. I'll start writting about the stuff I've done since my last visit. &nbsp; On saturday, after I posted, me and my family went to buy the rest of the things I needed. They included some Godiva chocolates my cousin wanted, a power drill my uncle wanted, and 2 air mattresses my aunt wanted. I also got some clothes =). It took a long time to get all of it since it was all in different parts of NJ (low sales tax!). I also got a nice 128 cd case thingy for my collection =) from WalMart, eventhough I hate that company x_x. Stupid Republicans....-_-.....anyways, XD, we also went to Wendys, which I must say is the BEST fast food restaurant in ever. I mean, the food is great and reasonably priced.  &nbsp; Later on Saturday I put all my cds in that case thing, and tried to make an MP3 CD for the plane ride x_x, I gave up since it was too many things to rip in a very small amout of time. I also said "see ya" to hannah =). I went to sleep at like 1 AM x_x. &nbsp; On Sunday I got up at around 8.5 and took a shower immediately. We left the apt. at around 10:45 and got to JFK at 11ish. I got checked in and then me and my family went to the food area. I ordered a large orange juice and we ate chicken nuggets from McDonalds, little pieces of heaven. At 12:30 I went toward the gate and the retards changed the gate at last minute x_x. I thought I was gonna miss the plane, but they delayed the flight like 1.5 hours x_x. In the meantime, I sat down and started listenin to Namie's complete single discography starting from "Don't wanna cry"=). I boarded the plane when I HAVE NEVER SEEN started. The airplane was soooo crowded and the seats were smallish too. It was a nice flight tho, the movie they played was "Matchstick Men" tho I didn't pay attention. As a meal they gave like 4 pieces of chicken with some potatoes and a brownie with a small glass of Coke. That was the highlight of the flight x_x, it was pretty ordinary. The last song I heard before descent was "mata ashita" =). luv ELT. &nbsp; When I got off the plane, the first thing I noticed was the humidity, it was REALLY high x_x. I got my bags, very ditzilly, I almost tripped a few people due to their weight and my lazyness induced weakness x_x. After that I saw my aunt and uncle and my little cousin. We got in the car and came home. I had plantains and scrambled eggs for supper, took a shower, and came to bed. &nbsp; On monday, I woke up early and went to my aunts job, she's a dermatologist, and hung out with my cousin who works there. It was pretty cool. After that me and my aunt went to get info on UNIBE, the school where I'll be going to. It's SOOOOO nice. Anyways, all I need is my transcript, which has been taken care of. That's basically everything interesting that's happened. Til next time!

      Hey everyone =). I didn't update yesterday because my retarded computer overheated and turned off as I was updating, so I lost the will to update. I promised I'd do one last update before I leave, so I'm doin' it now since I have some time now, and tomorrow I most likely won't. &nbsp; Anyways, Thursday was pretty boring like always, but I did see "I love the 90s" 1996 and 1997. =) I finally saw some stuff I remembered, and it was nice. So much has changed since then, it made me kinda sad since I was a kid ;_; and those days won't comeback. After that I came online for some chatter with mocchi and hannah, and left earlier than before. I think it was 11:30.  &nbsp; Then yesterday I woke up at 10:30 and took a shower, ate breakfast, and got ready to go to BOOK-OFF. I took the A and D trains to get there, since those leave me right there, less than a block away. Anyways, when&nbsp; I got there, I was pleasantly surprised to find tons of stuff by many many artists, and much of it was cheap!!! (The only bad thing was there was no affordable ELT stuff, and all the Namie items&nbsp;I already own x_x)&nbsp;I spent like an hour browsing and bought&nbsp;some stuff, none above $10 XD!!!!!!!!!!! Here's the list &nbsp; Albums: Ayumi Hamasaki - $7 globe -&nbsp;8 YEARS&nbsp;Many Classic Moments $7 BoA - LISTEN TO MY HEART $7 Mai Kuraki - FAIRY TALE $10 &nbsp; Singles Ayumi Hamasaki - AUDIENCE $7 DREAMS COME TRUE - SNOW DANCE $3 Mika Nakashima - Helpless rain $3 Mika Nakashima - ONE SURVIVE $3 MISIA - sweetness $3 &nbsp; Needless to say, I was a very happy boy =). Afterwards I went to the Japanese grocery store, x_x they haven't restocked anything, it was kinda sad, in the drinks area they only have budweiser and bottled water. They used to have BOSS and Amino Calpis and lots of other drinks and the snacks were also unstocked x_x. I was able to get strawberry pocky tho, and I bought some good chocolate =). I also got 2 packs of soy rice crackers, which are GOOOOOD and cheap!! &nbsp; I took the bus home, it was kinda depressing. You go from the extremely rich 5th avenue to the dump that is Washington Heights in less than an hour x_x. I listened to 3 singles on the way home, my favorite one was ONE SURVIVE, but the remix of "wasurenai hibi" makes the MISIA single worth buying by itself. &nbsp; That was basically all that happened yesterday, I also got a good copy of Fahrenheit 9/11, it looks very good =). &nbsp; This is my last update here in New York. So, as a final note, I'll say that the thing i'll miss most is NY itself. I mean, the noise, the smell, everything. For the last 10 years I've lived in NY, and I've enjoyed it a lot =). This is a great city, and I'll definetly move back here in 5 years. It's the greatest city in the world, you can find ANYTHING here, and the people are mostly friendly =). I LOVE YOU NEW YORK!! Don't ever change =). Anyways, baibai till Monday ^^.

      Afternoon ^o^, last night I saw "I Love the 90s," and I must say, I love the 90s =). It brought back some memories, they're getting close to the years when I actually started listening to music *1997-now*. This is embarrasing, but the first English-speaking group I listened to the the Spice Girl x_x. It's still cool to see the stuff that was popular before that, I kinda remember bits of it. Anyways, after that I came online for some drama and random chatter XD.   I went to sleep at 12:30, but in reality actually fell asleep at like, 2 x_x. However, XD, I woke up at 6. It's the anatomical brain clock methinks =). I watched NY1 for half an hour, caught up with the latest local news. Then I switched to C-SPAN , I saw that idiot Bush ramble about how Iraq wasn't a mistake blah blah blah -_-. Really annoying how he still has supporters -_-.  After that I saw some TV, I was like, going to sleep for 2 minutes and waking up 30 seconds later for a whole hour x_x. After that I ate waffles again, not as good as yesterday ._. and then came online and downloaded Namie's new PV!!!!!! ALL FOR YOU is such a great song =) XD!!!!!!! I listened to it like, 5 times in a row XD!!!!! Then I talked to mocchi for a while, and that's it so far. ttyl!  btw, the current soung is Koyote's Si Ryun, douzo.

      This morning's post was just a little preview =). Anyways, this is today's entry. This morning I woke up at 11:30 x_x, I REALLY need to start going to sleep earlier, especially since everyone goes to sleep in Tia's house at 11 and wakes up at 6-7ish. I wake up feeling kinda tired too, for some reason I think sleeping makes me more tired than I was before it.  After I woke up, I turned the computer on and did my daily routine, check BT sites XD and some other stuff. I got this blog =) and talked to mocchi. Then I ate waffles with cinnamon, *yum!* at around 1 and tried to get the music to work on this. I succeded, and if you haven't stopped it, you're listening to the lovely Namie Amuro's "Dreaming I was dreaming" =)!! Today has been so far kinda monotone x_x, but when you don't have the $$$ you really can't have fun here.  On friday I wanna go to BOOK-OFF before I move to Santo Domingo for the next 5 years x_x. I hope I find some goodies!!! I also wanna buy some snacks for the plane-ride. I'll see if anything else comes up and update again later =)! Baaai!
