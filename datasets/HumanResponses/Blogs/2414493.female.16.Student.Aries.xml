      So Enid, I sure hope you're happy because this, my friends, is Lydia's blog.   It's Thanksgiving break, a Saturday night, and I have no consolation but to know that SNL starts in about ten minutes or so. It's also that time of year again when the Christmas music starts playing, the icicle lights are up and families are hauling trees home. And somehow I just feel like I'm so out of it.  Remind me never to have four days of freedom with just about nothing planned, eh? Life without a schedule, as hated as it is, can be hell.   Life as it is now: there's mink dittos scattered all around my desk, and I still haven't memorized digastric and masseter, much less the rest of the 30-odd mink muscles to go.   Mrs. Battaglia thinks that the people who keep journals could be serial killers. I beg to differ. I don't even know where this strange desire to meticulously record thoughts and actions comes from. Maybe it's from boredom, or just a plain lack of SOMETHING TO DO. Yeah, maybe that's it.  I think I have a piano recital in a week and I'm dreading it. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against piano but practicing and anticipating drives me nuts.  Oh, don't worry about it. I am very strange when I am candid.

      I think I am so angry with myself I could go kill someone--maybe that someone is me.  Maybe I don't want to explain word for word, but let's just say that I have wasted my whole entire piano life. I just can't get it together, even for the smallest stupidest thing. I hate myself, i hate myself, i hate myself.  My whole entire week has been crap. I tutored for half an hour and didn't get paid jack, i had to spend so much time in journalism i had to cancel my driving lesson and spend an extra $20, and I don't know where that's going to come from. My week has been totally stolen from me. I couldn't spend Jess's birthday with her. I screwed up on the physio test. I screwed up on piano. I screwed up my whole entire life. I hate it. Why can't I ever do anything right?  I have had barely any time to myself this week. It's not fair--why can't I be normal? Why can't I get my $45 like I'm supposed to? Why can't I start feeling happy about Christmas, which is less than two weeks away? Maybe I'm just being selfish, but this year we have a smaller tree, and it's still unlighted. I have $40 right now for presents and all...some short time ago I had $90. I am going to spend two weeks moping, alone.  I've met one of Enid's friends online, Steve.

      another thing: I weighed myself today. Maybe next time I should do it without baggy clothing because the good ol' Cal sweatshirt weighs a pound, more or less. WAY TO GO, SELF ESTEEM!

      Dashboard Confessionals: "Standard Lines." I can't say I'm really into the emo/punk genre, and I only got into them because of big bro Nigel, but I like the guitar on this. I remember I had this stuck in my head for a good part of the summer.  So here I am, sitting at my desk, Bailey cracked open, doing a chapter summary. I know I'm supposed to be taking care of the term paper first, especially because it's due on Friday and I should probably work on it (I haven't touched it yet). But it's just one of those things where you know it's inevitable but you avoid it anyways. Or as long as you can.  Volunteering at the hospital yesterday. I honestly love it, no matter that it takes up three (usually four) hours of my time these days. It's one place where I can go about and be nice to everyone and nobody knows who I am during the school day. And it's just so nice to be helping people--the greatest are the discharges, where you know that your patient is happy to be going home and you can be happy with them. Isa was there, though, rescheduling. I can't believe how strict she is...maybe before I'd just never really come in contact with her in person before, and she was kind of snappy. Mercurial. So she gets on my case on how I'm not scheduled for Tuesday (what the hell? I talked to her about rescheduling to Tuesday) and made me temporary COD until Dan comes, etc. etc. I also snuck a peek at my hour log. It's kind of disconcerting...I saw that last month I had 12.5 hours (ok) and the month before was 8.something. I'm not sure. I just hope I had 100 or more by now, and I don't know if forgetting to sign out changes anything. I'm so stupid. I should take care of it, but I just forget to. I think I met a decent guy, but I'm pretty sure it's one of those little chimeras that disappear once you get to know them more. He goes to Moorpark, runs cross country, etc., and just got his permit before coming to the hospital Tues. He's mildly sarcastic (as opposed to very sarcastic) and spontaneous. I don't want to seem like a little subservient fool, though. If it works out, it works out. I'm not searching for that kind of thing anyways, but it's difficult to find decent people even when you're not looking at them beyond what they are to a normal passerby. Maybe I am picky, but I'll probably rethink it dramatically if I find out he's not exactly bright or if there's some other "fault" of his. I don't know. I'm not looking for anyone. And I really shouldn't care about this kind of thing right now.  "your hair/it's everywhere/screaming infidelities/and taking its wear"  Mock trial last night, the downer that interrupted my happiness at the hospital. I don't know what's wrong with me, but every time I go up there I get kinks in my questioning and I have to stand there while Julia tells me what to do. I almost broke down and just cried into the podium last night not because she was particularly mean but just because I was so tired of it all. I really don't know about mock trial this year. Everything about me wants us to do well because we have gotten so close before and I don't see why this year we can't just overcome that 2nd place and go to state. But it's bad during practices. You just sit there until it's your turn to cross or direct. I miss Erum in there to chat with, and Doupe's on prosecution and prefers to fraternize with other people. I don't blame him. I just want to do well, and I also want to be able to do my part. If I'm the least significant lawyer this year, I think it's time to rethink things.  Harrison and Julia still have issues with "pseudo boyfriend" and "shadow boyfriend." In their usual cackly way they've managed to infiltrate into the matter and just make too much of it. They've told me that they don't approve of the match, etc. (you must remember that Ryan isn't one of those colorful types that they smile upon) and have tried to set me up with Doupe, but I know that won't happen and I might as well wipe all traces of that out of my head. I just don't want to be associated with him anymore. It's so weird, I just don't.  A crap of a schedule this week. I'm not going to play piano today because I know the Chopin will just wear me out and my arms are tired already from typing this :) and I'm also hoping that the Conejo/choir thing is on SATURDAY, the same day as Colburn and, more importantly, Mr. Francis's impromptu recital. I really don't want to go. I hate performing piano because of the stress practicing and playing when you're up. It's just not a happy affair. I just want the concert to be on Saturday so I can skip colburn and Mr. Francis's recital. Only thing is...oh, shit, it's worse than I thought...Ed Lan, Wendy and I (I think that's it) all have to cop out. I think Wendy would; she's not too excited about this stuff either, but Ed would probably go, which makes it so that we have to go too. Ahhh.   Journalism deadline is Monday, so we're working our butts off this week. I got kicked out by the janitor today. I think one of these days he's just going to blow up and yell at me. He caught me tutoring once in the hallway and then another time today in 42E. I heard him dragging the trash cans around and all but had no idea that he actually went inside each and every room and cleaned out the trash cans, so I was just sitting tight hoping that he wouldn't check in Battaglia's. Yeah right. I'd closed the door right before because I hoped that would deter him, but pretty soon he wiggled the doorknob, took out his keys and came in. He was pretty calm about it, but I don't want to stretch it.  The OC's on in a few minutes. I'm tempted to watch. It's supposed to be a rerun, or so Scott says. Haha, good time to catch up.  I think the paper's actually going to come together fine this issue, except the center spread is another manufactured product from the center spread factory and if I had my say I'd change it. But you know what happens when you do. I hate Brandon. According to An ("An!") the soph and jr. girls are crazy about him, but I really wonder why. Sure, he's the type that is all touchy feely and all--even to me, so go figure--but he can be such a (and I use this word sparingly) bitch sometimes. He totally mocks me ("shut uuuup!") and he'll be mean and judgmental while Keira here is the angel on his shoulder. Not that he listens. Ok, so he's good at graphics, but I just think he's too difficult, too hoity toity. And he left his backpack in the classroom. I wonder what he does tomorrow morning. Tiff and I were walking one day right after 1st and we seem him just standing outside, not talking to anyone, outside his English classroom since his teacher wasn't there yet. And he complains to Pegleg how annoying :) Ryan is in Spanish. I much prefer Jonathan to Brandon.  Did 3 miles today. I hope that makes up for the C+ and buoys me back to an A, but I have fears that Flanderka will tell me that I can only do so much and raise my grade so much (will I end up with a B instead?) and I know I'll be devastated. She initially told me 12 laps (which I did today) but what if she changes her mind? Tiff has 20 because she did some another day with Desiree. I just hope it fixes the problem. We dedicated our laps to Costley. Damn it all.  It is so freezing cold lately.  Back to hw. Or The OC.

      It's 11ish, and I'm just having a good time reveling in my stupidity.  I wonder where all my stamina has gone. Even at the beginning of the year, my late-night/early morning record was past 3am. Now I'm lucky if I make it past midnight, still alive. Is it because the homework load has diminished? Probably not, since I still have the term paper to deal with, and when Mrs. Freeman--oh, shit, I realized I could do something journalism right now.   Anyways, I'll get to it soon. And my printer's running out of ink, too.  Right after I put up last night's post, I got a call from Tiff saying that Ryan and Mark had split from our main Excelsior body and was forming their own wind quintet kind of thing. So I'm like ok, they can go off and do their own kind of thing. But now I've realized that I haven't gotten rid of them just yet. Aw, that's such an insensitive way of putting it, too. As I understand it today, they're still part of Excelsior and all, just a separate branch. Ryan makes me mad sometimes, though. During English this morning he was talking to Alli about how he was starting a wind quintet and Would Alli like to join? I'd already heard about his secession plan but he didn't know it yet. I don't know if he was just flaunting it in my face to make me confused and jealous, but maybe I'm still a step ahead of him. Then, at the end of the day, we come out of history and he's like, "Have you talked to Tiffany today?" and I say no, knowing what he's going to bring up. He thinks he's so devious. He's not. He IS doing a good job of pissing me off though, so congrats, Ryan.   I really don't feel like I should have to go to the hospital tomorrow and have to talk to Irene about playing for us and then add that there's some other group that wants to do it too except we're not affiliated with them at all. That's just ridiculous, if you ask me. If you're going to cleave, go off and find our own venues. Don't make me do your work. I don't know. Maybe it's simply my misunderstanding of the situation, but I'm not too happy about what I see. And I was talking to Mark and Ryan comes on, or so Mark says. I'm still blocking him. And I think by now he knows it, so tomorrow morning will certainly be interesting. But I don't really care anymore if he just marches off in the opposite direction, because I don't have anything to say to him and anything he'd say to me is probably something slimy, as it was after sixth period today.   I am not a happy camper.  And for some reason, the journalism dealine now is next Monday instead of next Wednesday, so that cuts down on work time. My main concern is that I'm trying to put together an investigative article on plagiarism and turnitin.com, except I haven't gotten any interviews or information. Go me. I really feel terrible about it, though, and when finish this I'm making up a survey and seeing if I can pass it out to Ballard's classes, since he's so flexible about going off on tangents anyways. I'll see if I can capitalize off of it, I guess. It's just that I have my first driving lesson on Friday and I don't want to cancel, but I just might have to since it goes from 3 to 5pm and that's prime journalism time. I also have to tutor on Wednesday when I want to make up laps for PE (patching up for Costley's tyranny) so I'll have to get rescheduling in order, and even then, that still cuts into journalism time. I just want to fulfill my role as copy editor, too. Sometimes I feel like I'm so bogged down by other pages and other obligations that I'm not doing my job that's been assigned to me. And Keira has to house-sit starting Wednesday and tutor as well, so she's going to be busy. Melody's always busy. So maybe it's Jonathan, Coral and me, if I can manage to stay. OH, this sucks.  Mr. Francis saw the tape of me playing at the Contemporary Festival. It wasn't a happy scene. I've forgotten all about it by now and thought that I was getting off scot free; didn't happen. I also have a piano recital next weekend, too. I know it's an informal affair, just at his house, where he lines up the kids and has them go up and play whatever's ready, but I know that by the time I get up there, I won't be the same person who usually plays during lessons. And I'm annoyed because I did practice this weekend, just not honest piano stuff. I have Colburn on this next Saturday, the same day as the recital. We are all expected to come back from Colburn, grab something to eat and report to Mr. Francis's house to play. I'm doing the Chopin scherzo. Somehow I supposed that ok, maybe we weren't going to have a recital because so many have to go to Colburn, but it didn't work out that way. Oh, damn it, in the middle of journalism and schedule hell I also have to practice enough to be able to present Chopin at a recital.  Talk about a crappy day. I thought it was just because it was Monday's fault; I forgot my wallet and phone, I didn't exactly get paid for half an hour of tutoring (should I? $7.50, maybe?), had to deal with Ryan and the physio test and a history test and make like I didn't care about Excelsior.  Tiff annoys me a bit, though. She says I'm too uptight about things and thus takes all matters into her own hands, which I almost resent. I mean, whenever she sees me, it's like "Ok, bye" and she finds some reason to ride off into the sunset. I mean, ok, so maybe I am anal retentive, but that doesn't mean you have to deprive me of a civil greeting (what of the dork initiation today? HUH?) and of whatever's going on in Excelsior. Ok, so she can talk to Heather and I won't interfere. Just tell me what the heck is going on and don't make me feel like everyone else who gives a damn in Execelsior has just turned their backs on me.   Except Andrew. But God knows which side he'll wander off to.

      I have officially been eating too much. It's the worst thing on weekends: I go on eating rampages that scour out the refrigerator and the pantry.Well, maybe it's not that extensive but it's enough to make me squirm. It's just not right, I say. And I used to have the logic that ok, I'll eat on weekends and burn it off during the week when I'm so busy I don't have time to eat, but the scale isn't indicating that this particular mindset is working. I've been trying to stave off temptations since Jack in the Box this afternoon with Jess but I just had a piece of cold lotus root.  And I'm back from dinner at grandma's house now. I told myself I'd study physio; it didn't happen. Television is always an attractive aspect.  I miss having long hair. I was looking through YSP pictures and I used to have enough to put it up and have it forking around my neck. I really wonder why I all of a sudden decided that I'd donate it. I mean, it's all right now that it's short because it means shorter showers and shorter blowdrying, but I just miss it. I can't explain why. This whole thing about giving to other people rather than keeping it for yourself is really getting on my nerves. But then I've always been selfish and am not too ashamed to admit it.  I still have "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" stuck in my head. It's such the perfect song for my kind of holiday...mellow, and, in ways, sad. I don't think I ever had the perfect Christmas, but maybe it's being selfish again. Jess says her parents spend about $300 on presents for her, and I'm thinking that Mom and Dad here wouldn't dare do such a thing.  Thinking of which, I wonder what's up with Dad's business and the economy and all. It's kind of humbling to actually pay attention to the fact that Dad's dealings aren't exactly doing swell, and it's probably the first time I've been conscious of it while it was happening. I mean, the whole thing about not being able to go to Harvard for sure is all because Dad says the storage economy still sucks, and I'm being selfish yet again but it used to be, "Sure, you can go to Harvard, no problem." I honestly wouldn't mind having to move out of here into a smaller house because I really don't need all of this space and I don't know how much the house is stretching Dad, but I don't think it's going that poorly just yet. I just hope it improves. I have no idea how hard Dad works, but just seeing him on the weekends makes me realize that it's not all spiffy. I just hope it's not incorrigibly screwed up.  I am always tempted to call those radio stations when they ask ppl to call now to win something, and I finally did today. Not that anyone picked up on the other line. When you're studying physio for a few hours straight listening to 102.7 it gets kind of irritating when every few minutes they give away Disneyland passes. Mind you, I'm not dying for some, but I just gave them a call...5 times straight. Given my coordination and my timidity, I think it's a given that all I got was the busy tone...whatever you technically call that.  Piano lesson tomorrow. I always feel bad when I haven't practiced. Well, I HAVE practiced, but it wasn't assigned music, just the Christmas stuff. God forgive me for being so naive about Excelsior and actually thinking that they'd actually do something different for a change, but needless to say, they didn't.  I miss talking to Nigel. I know most of the time it's just solving each other's problems (mine more than his) but now that he actually has secured Jackie his time's all taken up. I don't blame him though; it's natural and I'm happy that it turned out the way it did. I guess I can't be selfish here. Things will happen when they happen. Oh dear, I remember when I used to have the hugest crush on him in 8th grade, though it's not like I'm ever going to tell him because I feel nothing of it now. I hate crushes. You just spend the whole entire time thinking about them and you know it's not going to happen but you just do it anyways. It's just some demon that pervades your thought processes.  I'm proud of myself that I'm not talking to Ryan at the moment. I actually blocked him last night and got the hugest power trip from it. I don't want to talk, don't want to talk, don't want to talk. It's just something different, I guess. Last year we used to be passionate about the same things and we'd get along so well. Maybe it was just because we both obsessed in the same direction and it just matched up. But now...he's still big into school and doing well (he looked up the AMC results and emailed the page to me last night...he beat me, etc. etc. etc. but I can't believe he's so into that) and youth commission and cynicism and I'm just trying to get away from that all. I'm not saying I've been wholly successful, but there's just things I would have tolerated last year that I can't tolerate in him now. I think it's absolutely normal that people change like this. For the longest time I guess I smelled a rat but I couldn't let myself believe that it was really true and now I realize this more and more every day.  Mind you, I won't tell him, and maybe that's the saddest part of the story. I don't know how he feels about me at this point and I think I can say now without qualms that I really don't care. I mean, most of the time he's just pessimistic and sarcastic and unfeeling, and that's really not what I need now, since I'm going through the same things he is and I want to release my frustration like that but I'm not going to because that's just not my way. At homecoming (another surreal chapter in my life) he was making faces and thinking of rather out of context games and just standing around. I think if he weren't with me I'd dance, but hah, too late now. And I've been tempted to look back and say gee, I shouldn't have implied so much in silence on those baseball field bleachers, but then again, I was just so disillusioned, I guess, that it was better for me not to say anything. I don't think I would have wanted to say anything. It was all so weird, and part of me just screams out that I wish I'd been a little more greedy and asked Nige to take me as a favor to his desperate little sis who only got a date two days before homecoming. I saw him going in with Phyllis, and I was going to see if I could find them, but you know the rest of the story. My biggest regret is that I didn't have a better time. I mean, it was a huge milestone, even though I'm not all too fond of the pomp and circumstance and if you put me in a group with Tiff Hsiou and Lisa Tagliati and Vanessa Kreger, you know who's the odd one out.   But I can't spend so much time regretting. I guess my next step is just to figure out how I can get rid of something etched into everyone's head that Ryan and I go together, because we don't anymore, and now that I've finally come to terms with it it's logical to just erase it out of everybody's heads. I really don't care if he goes to La Reina's winter ball with Pooja, talks politics and dances. I'm not into that kind of thing anymore.  We have absolutely no news for journalism. But maybe it's better that I just handle two pages and resume my rightful role as copy editor, the boringest job on the paper. I'm proud of it! Ugggh.

      I tried to write something earlier venting about the un-success (failure is too strong for now) of Excelsior practice, but I think it's of no use now if I just keep on talking. I think it'd be best musically if we just didn't use Mark or Ryan, but the hardest part is actually telling them. Ryan's probably using the "maybe' strategy now to make me feel like he's too good for it, but little does he know that we've got a greater plan for him. It's so much more peaceful with just Tiff and Andrew (I almost typed in Tiff and Ryan, since that used to be the old trio...) around. I don't know what to do. I really want this to continue not so much for just college bragging rights now but because it stands for two things I really care about. Too bad that it doesn't seem like other people share my passion. I spent $15 today on copies and binders...that's an hour of tutoring. I still can't console myself that it was ok and everything's gonna be all right (break into song) but the truth is, I don't want to deal with it. It was perfectly fine with just TIff and Andrew around, but with Heather and Mark and Ryan it's virtually impossible to function.  Anyways. Went out to Mandarin Wok for dinner. It's one of those places where you don't go because it's a fantastic restaurant but because it serves Chinese food and your family knows the menu by heart. The classic beef noodle soup (almost spelt it soop) and then fried fish with ginger and salt (and peppers), and then beef with tomatoes. Thanks, Enid. Now I've forgotten how to spell "tomato."  And now I'm back at the compy trying to do math hw, except it occurred to me that I might as well unload. I blocked Ryan for the first time in relative history today, and the funny thing is, I don't feel bad at all. And then I unblocked him and was incorrigibly pessimistic, just like HE is sometimes.  Maybe we should take Andrew out for a Pick Up Stix and Barnes and Noble excursion, followed by a spin in the world-famous dizzy chair to initiate him.  Damn it, I just lost part of the post b/c I tried to copy paste. Yeah right.  When I grow up, I dream of being a layout editor on a newspaper or a magazine. I just love that feeling of control. But then again, journalism makes me sad sometimes. Perhaps on that day Keira is off tutoring and Melody has something to do and Brandon has a job (one of many) and Jonathan has Girlfriend Day or something, and it's just me. Bret annoys the heck out of me sometimes...he thinks he's so funny. But maybe I'm just such a sourpuss that I'm an ideal butt end of jokes. It's just--nobody seems to be so into this kind of thing, except maybe Jonathan. I wish Jess was still around in 42E after hours.  The next time anyone uses "everyday" to mean "every day" or "every day" to mean "everyday" I will go after someone with Andrew's switchblade. It's all over the media. What are these people thinking? Are they trying to infuse grammar chaos upon the unknowing American population? Damn them all.  I still have the taste of fortune cookie and orange in my mouth. You know how at Chinese places they always send you a plate of fortune cookies and orange slices with the bill? I hate the combination in my mouth. It tastes like pre-barf. Yup.  So yeah. I was trying to find the square root key and ended up on blogger. Go figure.

      New post, new post, new post.   It's a crappy good autumn day. Cloudy days are usually a plus, but when you're stuck inside plowing through a mountain of homework, it's not going to make you feel any better.  Assignments over the weekend:  TERM PAPER. Haha, I screwed up so much on this thing already that I don't ever want to see it again. Freeman has gone through with green marker and put comments, and her last one just made me think, ugh, I'm so done with this.  MINK. Stupid minkie. On Monday we get to see a video of mink parts and write down the name of the muscle, the origin and the insertion and the action...for about 40 parts? 50? I have this fear that it's not going to stick. MATH PROJECT. Award-winning or not, I still think it's unbelievably tedious--why do we have to create some fake resume for a mathematician who might be already dead?  BAILEY TEST. If you ask me, I think Ballard's class is the least substantial of any I've ever had, with the exception of Aca Deca, probably. How can you take a class seriously when the teacher's tangents are planned?   Agh, so that's it, I hope. I have Excelsior practice this afternoon. God knows that Charle. isn't going to turn up much in terms of where we're going. Ryan's going to grumble that horn doesn't do C major. Heather is going to remind us that she has to leave early for a party. Andrew wants to see my room, which makes me squirm...does he not remind you of a freshman demeanor-wise? And I have to pick up Mark, who literally lives two minutes away from me. I can totally see it as being another practice where we get off on some exciting conversational topic and don't play for a good twenty minutes in between.   And the most disappointing fact is that I'm probably the only one who cares about this thing. Charle. won't even talk to me now because she hasn't taken care of her part; Ryan's never liked this in the first place and I'm surprised he hasn't thrown in his towel, and Heather is questionable. I'll leave it at that.   Eh, I've changed my mind. I'm not letting anyone read the birthday journal, let alone Ryan. I can imagine him going through it and making faces and thinking of me as a greater retard than he already thinks I am. And I've stopped making a habit of ripping the calendar pages off. It doesn't mean that much to me anymore. He doesn't mean that much to me. I mean, I've forgotten what it feels like to tingle when you know someone's thinking of you.   And maybe physical attraction is overrated.   Scott's out at a hooooliday parade today--with a girl. I can't explain why I'm so happy for him. It's so refreshing to see him fret over a girl...and it's so cute. Although according to instincts I really don't believe that he hasn't been into this before, but I'll let him say whatever.   I have $90 that's mine, all mine. From tutoring. Except I know I have to get bday presents for Jess and Anna and then Christmas presents for mom and dad and grandma and Pug, but I really don't fee like it because I want to hoard all the money I earn and blow it off on something ridiculous. Like a shopping spree on Third St. Damn it. I hate Christmas presents between friends. I guess I'm obligated to give something back, but even if I spend $5 per person that amounts to what? $40? Less, I hope? I just don't want to get little stupid presents for people that probably won't mean anything.  Things I want for Christmas: the stupid and the practical *to spend next summer at Harvard (or Stanford) *to be able to go through two weeks of nothingness without going crazy *money...I've only realized recently what a money hog I am *CDs, or an MP3 player *more independence *to stop associating with people who aren't worth associating with  And that's it. I'm out of brain juice.

      Lydia floated happily into a dreamy, airy state while in her right ear, a disturbance called her alarm clock buzzed nervously.  I still can't believe it happened, but it did...I don't know what to think, frankly. What was it he said? "Keep it low...?" That's so perfectly fine with me.  Smiles all around.

      A most interesting day. I think I've gone through enough to say that if I died today, I would go in peace.  Mock trial, 9am this morning. One of those practices where nobody's really awake--even J wasn't in her usual perverted mindset this morning). Hilarious to the nth degree. I talked to the bug for the first time online last night and it was just one of those conversations that actually go beyond "what's up?" I can only count a few people like that...E, S and now C, occasionally N. I love him, he's so funny and always so full of energy, so upbeat. He was on the stand today and for some reason I just couldn't stop laughing at his answers because they sounded so normal him instead of scripted River Lenox and it was almost like sarcasm. Besides that, it has become apparent that there's some serious planning in the get D to winter ball scheme. Frankly, I don't know what's going to happen since it deals with guys with no balls (or vaginas, as C calls them) and a girl who is probably too out of it to think anything of coaches falling out of chairs, of secret conferences between people who inexplicably mean more to her than any regular person would. So let's just say that I jump every time the phone rings. And there it goes--line two. lol  Car ride to Malibu Lagoon with C. Adopt a Beach. There's something about PCH that makes me feel so damn good. Every time I find myself looking out the windows at that little two-lane highway with the beach houses and that curve where the sea meets the sand, I remember something happy about it. The first day, clouds and hope. Then the Vermonster and giggling to no end. Trips to Santa Monica, Jimmy Eat World...and now this. Lunch today at Neptune's Net. Sitting next to a group of bikers, probably not too much of a threat since they had "Soldiers for Jesus" embroidered on the backs of their leather jackets. Drive up Decker, things not to be mentioned...  And now, waiting for a phone call.  Life is beautiful.

      In a strange, meditative mood.  Scrimmage with Oxnard today. One of the greatest things ever--when you know that you suck but the other team sucks worse? wow, refined language. Perhaps a superiority complex was involved, but this team was dumbed down: no objections, quiet witnesses, a clerk who figured out time using her cell phone calculator...lol, and it finally hits me right here that I'm really tired. It's interesting how mock trial teaches you to hate the guts of your opponents by trial's end.  BJ's tonight after the scrimmage. Sat at a table with some people I don't know at all, some people I know and some people I know very well. Julia and Ms. Harrison at the next table. So perhaps I'm breaking out of my shell, but it's still weird to be sitting in the orange half-light of the restaurant at 9pm with a football dude with a very long tongue (here J is excessively engrossed :)), with a bug named Charlie and Doupe and Jean and everyone. Maybe I'm beginning to understand Jean's theory that it's better to realize your intelligence, dumb yourself down and play it to your advantage with other people. J and H are still setting up conspiracies...they asked me if I could go to winter ball and I told them about orchestra and then, at the very end, they said something like, "oh, just kidding. you can go back to your seat now." And they talked to D about asking me. I don't know where in the world they're going with this, but I'll take it as it comes.  Perhaps with each passing day it's easier to let go more and more of the life I used to have as an oblivious and obsessed nerd--I guess that's the best way to put it. Not talking to R still bugs me, but I see him around with other people and it's like ok, fine, whatever. And in mock trial (which, btw, is bound to take over my life in the coming month) I'm comfortable enough--more than I deserve, actually, and so I shan't complain.  It's taken me 15 years to realize that life (particularly HS life) is a beautiful thing, and maybe I've finally come to terms with it tonight. Admittedly, I'm not ready to give myself over completely for there remain fundamentally Lydia parts in me, but I see now that there's greener grass on the other side. For all it's worth, I had a good day today...it isn't one of those days where you can say, ok, I've lived to the fullest and if I had to leave this world today I would be finished, but it's getting there.  So with little fear and less reservation, Lydia goes opportunity-hunting.

      LOL. Sorry for being Whiny, E. I think I'll really be fine now...but if you're going anywhere else that might allow a Lydia in attendance...tell me?  First day of second semester. Not much has changed, actually--interpret that as you wish. I think the highlight of my day wasn't eating that gross orange-flavored PB&J or not being able to use the copy machine like I said I could with JP (Jorge Pedro! hah!) but MOCK TRIAL. We are one crazy group, and if it's anything to make me feel better, it's good ol' MT. Arr, I still wish I could drive. Think: it's two miles to the gate, a nominal two more to get post-it's at Staples or two the other way to BJ's for BJ's night tomorrow. No biggie, honestly. But then I think, whoa, what if I get killed or something and I get in deep trouble for it? I don't know, deep down I'm still so conservative it's not even funny. But I really want to go somewhere now that I think I'm partway capable of doing so.  The concerto's falling together in my head--yay!  No hw, really, for second semester. What am I going to do with my time now? Sort out stuff? Yeah, maybe.

      What the hell. How do I get the impression that everybody's having a good day but me? that nobody else spent the whole entire day holed up in the house? I don't know where this sudden discontent is coming from, but I really need to fix it. From T's profile: "I had the BEST day with P," etc. Granted, I don't even know who P is, and I rarely even talk to T anymore, but it just rubs it in that everyone but me had fun. S skipped classes, E went to moca...and I stayed home and sat on my butt.

      So there's two readers now, Enid and Steve. Very appropriate, since I really can't see anyone else reading about my [adjective] life.  Four and a half hours of piano today, plus a lesson, topping five. I would probably tell R if I was talking to him at this point in time, but I won't.  It's another day in the life of Lydia. I'm sitting here listening to Goo Goo Dolls and trying to do my Bailey except conversation is much, much more interesting. I'm kind of pissed off that the housekeeper pleated my pants. AGAIN. Well, thank god it's only the gray khakis (v. the khaki khakis or the gree ones or the light ones, etc.). No pleated running shorts for tomorrow.  I must be doing something wrong with the shaving cream. lol, I don't know why it bothers me so much but the rim of the can is accumulating rust and old pieces of old shaving cream. What am I supposed to do? It's kind of gross, and I just hope I finish this one soon.  I just can't shake off this overwhelming feeling of being an idiot. E, supposedly, has broken off her antisocial streak, so that leaves just me. With tomorrow comes a new semester, a new beginning, perhaps? I know there'll be people around that I can at least carry on a civilized conversation with, but not much more, and that's kind of depressing. What the heck is wrong with me? Sure, I'll act like nothing is going on, but something is, and I just wish I had a more tangible support base.  Argh, I can't work with the music on anymore.  Somewhere between flushing the toilet and washing my hands I remembered how in the first grade I thought "hate" was a bad word. Happily, I've now progressed past that horrible H word to the more pleasant sounds of crap, shit, hell, etc. To be used sparingly, of course. It's funny how we perceive words. I always thought "segway" was just that new mode of transportation but now I hear "segway into" as if it existed in the pre-Segway (with a capital S) days. And how we stick to our own pronunciation of words. Remember idio-sin-CRAZY?  I'm tired of just sitting here, and now that S has retreated to the safety of his shower, it's probably best that I focus on getting Bailey done, eh?

      Silly how once you do just about nothing with your day, it's so much easier to write about.  Lunch with Uncle Garlan and family today, dumplings, etc., out. Grandma's over at their house now. Mom and I had to get home by 1, she for the New Year program, me for MT, so that was it. Our first MT runthrough today. Even the coaches and their criticisms can't get R to stand up straight and look confident, so maybe it wasn't my fault that I couldn't change him. Sweater smells like J now that she wore it. I have to practice mucho piano for tomorrow. I don't know what to do with Mar. 3 and the hospital, since T isn't really part of it anymore...life is insane.

      I woke up this morning and decided that I wasn't going to apply for that pageant. If they can't put correct grammar in the brochure and the website doesn't seem like the profeessional, serious kind, I might as well stop trying, for all I see now is some half-hearted, seedy program. Well, that was harsh. I am not and never will be a beauty queen, and I might as well drop the issue even though it IS scholarship money. I think I'll have to go shred that horrible pink application to make me feel better.  Going to Burberry today to return N's scarf. I think, by now, things have been put into perspective and perhaps life is returning to normal, so I hope I don't suffer from pangs of guilt after it's all done. I feel so much better that I'm driving there, too, for it seems more like a pilgrimage that way.  Orchestra concert last night. S just won't shut up about certain things: according to W and H he's "into older women," etc. and still hasn't found out that some people don't appreciate his lack of humility. And the whole entire time in the green room he was playing the piano. Went to Coldstone with W, H, A and DO at the wheel--one of those trips that you have terrible qualms about while it's happening. D, apparently, likes to show off his sound system and drives awfully fast and seems to be into W. Wouldn't be the first guy, eh? The only way I look back at this situation now is with the same feeling that you recall something int he past but you don't really make much of it.  Winter ball is a stupid, stupid affair and W, H and A love to speculate about who's asking who, etc. and I never realized it was such a big deal. Anyways, it's the night of the Chinese New Year performance and I probably have to show up for mom's sake, so that's my excuse for not going.  I feel like I've gone overly antisocial, and maybe that one decision beginning to bug me. E's out of town, so I barely have J and T. I don't know. It's nice to be connected to people, but it also means placing emotional security somewhere outside of yourself. Oh, what the heck. New semester starts Tuesday, and things are bound to change.

      Short posts, short posts.   From this point in time, finals week devastation is almost over. The only real "test" is in history tomorrow, and that's not going to be any more difficult than what we've had before. And then there's running the mile in off-season (and that probably means I have to shave tomorrow morning...grr) but that's no sweat. Coming home, I will have the chance to meet the members of the Chinese Mommies' Book Club, which happens to include N's mother. Very, very interesting. I'm grinning already.  Oh shit, it's already 10:42 and I still haven't studied.  Orchestra concert tomorrow. I guess it's ok, but I still feel like an idiot sitting where I'm sitting because I always get the feeling that there's people who deserve to sit in my seat who end up sitting behind me. And it's at Calvary again, so they have that Annoying (with a capital A) camera that occasionally picks out the face of some unfortunate orchestra member and shows the world that blah concentration face. A said his mom thought I wasn't really paying attention, which is true, but it's one of those things that you know you do but you never want other people to find out about. I really need to practice for orch. I had some angry demon inside my head and I just couldn't concentrate; it's so embarrassing. S sits diagonally behind me in the other row and I keep on thinking that he'll listen to me and make some snide comment about things when he's with his cronies. It's a whole self-esteem thing. But I know I don't deserve to feel good about my playing yet, so I might as well swallow it. I just hope B doesn't alert to it or anything, for then I'd really get screwed.  Chinese New Year today. Parents are more generous this year, I suppose, so it's $50 in place of $40. I haven't opened Grandma's yet. I always feel so guilty opening those red envelopes, I don't know why.  Tutoring ended well today, at least: K has to study for her math final and we got through it just fine. I really hope she does well, though, because she at least has some math sense. With M, it's more difficult--but then I concede Spanish is more difficult for beginners anyways. It's one of those question and answer tests, so you read the question and she writes the answer down. She just doesn't have some sort of mental mechanism to detect noun-adj. agreement or lack of a verb or something like that. I mean, I wish I could tell success stories, but now I think I'll just have to be satisfied if ppl keep coming back :). And she owes me $67.50, too. I keep on counting how much I would earn if I charged more: $90 at $20/hr, $75 if I charged $20/hr for gas too. It's just something about money that makes me feel like I'm going somewhere. If I have enough of it, I can do whatever I want, to an extent--like go the the YSP reunion :) and go shopping, etc.  Dying of fatigue. It's been a long week, folks.

      Hmph, I don't think I know the first thing about blogging. I write too much.   I still have Maroon 5 stuck in my head. It gets muddied up in my mind after a while since so much of it sounds the same, but some tracks are absolutely memorable.   Finals aren't that bad now once that English and Spanish and Math are over with. It was so weird looking at that math final again, knowing that it screwed me over the last time. I don't know what to make of the fact that had I messed up on one less problem over the summer, I'd be in Calculus right now, but that's no matter. It's over with, and plus, that's too super geek for the rest of the world so I might as well can it.  Erum's on a plane to Saudi Arabia right now, to do the hajj, or the pilgrimage or something. It's just amazing that the girl who's always stressing about school (along with everyone else) in an Aeropostale sweatshirt across from me in English is going to that legendary black box to walk around, to perform the steps.   More and more I realize what a wallflower I am. I'm not going to change anything now since fundamentally, being antisocial feels right, but it's just kind of strange when you're sitting there and everyone has someone else to talk to and you're just bent over a book trying to make like you have something better to do. But self-pity is an evil thing.

      Hello again.  I think I'm going to apply for that stupid pageant thingy, but only because I want to see how good my chances are for earning scholarship money. I have the feeling that if I make it, it's going to be a terribly silly affair, not at all what Lydia's used to doing, but hey, it's worth a try, isn't it?  You know, I'm still fundamentally me. I was checking grades on Edline and I realized that I didn't get credit for some assignments, etc., and that set me in a panic even though my grade isn't in jeopardy at the moment. I don't know how I've become so anal about some things, but in a way it's a kind of a safeguard--it'll be useful come college, when I'm sure getting A's will be much more of a struggle.  *Dad said I could go to Harvard over the summer today!* I still feel bad, though. It's $7,600 not including airfare, and there are some college summer programs out there that aren't as expensive, but then again they don't happen to offer as many courses. Ideally, I'd like to take a psych course and their Creative Nonfiction, since I'm still stuck on "Best American Essays." In my dreams, some Harvard prof discovers my writing and I become famous, except that's ARROGANCE again and I know it won't happen.  Went to the Colburn seminar today. Turns out that I got the middle seat in the front row and I had to turn pages, except there was this Brahms trio with two editions. The group played the revised, I was looking at the original, and freaking out because it was usually S. or C. who turned pages and they were good pianists, and I thought my not being able to find the notes reflected poorly on my piano playing ability. E. was sitting next to me and I thought, ok, he's good too so maybe he'll keep an eye out for me. In the middle of the trio, I was so lost and so embarrassed.  Besides that, the two trios that played were so beautiful. The first one you could expect excellence, I guess, since the kids looked pretty mature about things. The second was a group of younger kids, but they played with equal spirit and ability. What a difference vibrato makes! I think one of these days I'll go through our Brahms and do the violin part instead and see if I can get the same effect, since it doesn't sound like it usually. Cello and violin playing together was so pretty, plus the melody...it was a very uplifting experience (if only I knew which edition we were using).   The two trios today really made me want to go back to our Brahms and see if we could touch up on it and make that lovely vibrato sound, but then I think back and realize that I don't have the other two anymore. In fact, it's not even my music, so I should probably return it to R.  And every time I go, I realize I could be so much better if I practiced. The difference today was that I realized that it applied to both piano and violin. I wonder how much time those people must spend sitting at the bench or standing with a violin under their chin. Stamina is one thing I lack. I can't even run a mile, which is pathetic when J tells you that she woke up at 4 that morning to do a few miles. I can't practice piano diligently, and especially not now because it's finals weekend. I am not a very good self-motivator.  It's so funny how C and W are so into who's pretty/hot and who's not. I feel like such an outsider sitting in the car when they're talking about these things, which makes me believe that something's seriously wrong with the way I'm wired. Or maybe...well, it just seems so isolationist and cold of me not to say anything when they do, but then again that's my character. How do I reconcile the two?

      song stuck in my head: Maroon 5, "This Love"  This love has taken its toll on me She said Goodbye too many times before And her heart is breaking in front of me I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore  Argh, I liked the music, didn't care for the parts of the lyrics that could possibly apply to my own life.  And I don't know how this is to turn out, but this thing's public now. Oh, shit, that sounds so terrible and I've gotten cold feet now so I'm taking it off.   Okay, problem solved!

      Zach's home for the weekend and wanted to see   Indiana Jones   before he had to go back. Tonight or tomorrow night. So I go and ask mom, she says no, then I'll think about it. I've already told Zach no and I'm pretty sure that I'll get a "don't get involved with boys" talk once it hits her again, in which case I'll be terrifically annoyed. I don't even remotely like him in that way. It was always his initiative, not mine, and it's always been absolutely harmless. So I think I'll just smile it off, for I know that these talks can be brutal sometimes. Remember that last episode? I seethe inside to even think about it.

      Well, I have two more happy thoughts to add to last night's list:  a) I've been promoted to sixth chair in the first violins in orchestra. Granted, that doesn't sound that extraordinary, but the first four are the people who tried out for concertmaster. But then again, I am ever inclined to feel so guilty about it. Okay, so I've stuck around for a while, and it appears that Benson does seating not only on ability and attendance but also on how long you've been in CVYO. And then there's the possibility that I'm only sitting so close up because Mom's in charge of the Chinese New Year program, and the orchestra's playing in it, so is it a measure to save face? I just don't think I am worth it. The stand immediately behind me is Josh and Hank, and I know they're both good and more serious about violin than I am. I know that behind me there's Sean (who's still hoity toity about things) and Sherman, etc.--very, very competent people. And it's just ironic that this is the first seating audition where I haven't had a teacher, where I haven't been so terribly nervous about things. I just cannot believe that my violin playing is improving without practice and without instruction, so that raises an eyebrow. But it just so happens that Ellen (the older one) is my stand partner and won't be around at rehearsal until practice, so I get bumped up to the outside seat. I don't know if I want this: it means that the people sitting in the first few rows of the audience can   really   hear you now, that I can't hide behind the arms of other people and that I have to learn the top part in the divisi sections.   Well, any way you put it, I'm pleasantly surprised but I still doubt myself. And it means a lot of practice and counting before rehearsal next week.  b) second majorly good thing: I didn't get picked for Spanish orals today. You see, in comparison to period 4, period 2 is a very wimpy class. We've long forgotten about   la vela  , we complain audibly about the increasing difficulty of Bruckner's class, and to put the icing on the cake we're short of volunteers for the oral final where period 4 just has half the class valianty offers to go. At any rate, I could potentially screw up in that class and I wasn't ready for the orals today, so thank whatever higher deity there is that I didn't have to go lie in the middle of the road and prepare to get run over, figuratively speaking.  Got a death threat today. From none other than Tiffany. "IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO MY EMAIL I'LL GO AFTER YOU AND KILL YOU MYSELF." Sure signs of maturity, I'll say.  I honestly don't care how this darn thing turns out anymore, since it's petty and silly and Tiff is obviously exaggerating the severity of the situation. The only thing I remotely miss is being able to talk to Ryan, but then again that is sure to end up in complaining and scholarly discussions and ultimately silence once again. So I shan't tempt myself.

      omg, I've been so terribly negative for a while now, so a happy thought:  happy thoughts, actually.  above all, I am thankful for the solace of self-expression, even when the receiving end is only paper. I am thankful for the people I see only rarely, who have yet to come to the point where they need to judge me. I am thankful for the pain of hard work and the belief that something good is to come out of all of this. I am thankful for those splotches of color in my life, the people who don't find it necessary to bring up whatever yuckiness I have in me, who just make me feel like I am a normal worthy human being.

      Argh. So hello again. I know I haven't been on in ages, but I think it's fair to say that I'm weak enough again to sign back on and update this sad chronology of my emotional distress.  This is probably the first day since Nick passed away that I've been less stoned-looking/mopey and more approachable. To be honest, I still cannot believe that Nick's gone. I regret so much that we were all so selfish that we couldn't stay another 15 minutes and see him for what was to be the very last time...I think the last time I must have seen him in the flesh was last June but he continually pops up in MT conversations and otherwise.   And this whole thing has made me think about what Nick meant to me. Betty at the hospital, bless her!, thought it was someone really really close. I mean, I knew Nick and loved him just as everyone else did. How could you not love someone who was so comfortably male and cosmopolitan at the same time? How could you not smile at his talent for acting and making people laugh? his obsession with Burberry? He is one of those characters in my life who are so unabashedly vibrant and so fundamentally perfect that you just can't let go of them. Veronique is another person. So is Adam Borelli, though I never knew him well. Wow, that's pretty sad. I can't think of more people in my generation like that.  So it happens that for the first time ever in my mock trial life, there will be no Nick Salyers with his Burberry scarf and his Starbucks telling us all how we'd better shape up before competition or else we'd lose. There will be no Nick pep talks, no Nick jokes from him, though there will be plenty happy memories of him. Only now do I see all the ways in which he has shared a smile, a laugh, a life. It makes me want to be that kind of universally-admired person, though already the shoes are so hard to fill.  I'm actually not that busy today. It's a down day, and it's especially light since we're on the edge of finals. The only after-school obligation today was running make up laps. I think I should have a 95 right now, and if it's still a B I am not going to be a happy camper. Tomorrow promises to be worse, though. I have over two hours of tutoring--how I always dread it before it happens and smile after it does!--and orchestra. Plus, I'd like to have time to come home, sit down and eat.  And another emotional stinker: Charlemagne has revived the stupid charges against me and I've dragged Ryan into the fray. As usual, I've gotten mad at him first and most directly, and I'm starting to alienate people. MY FAULTS: that I am an arrogant, selfish, pathetic whiner, that I assume that I'm better than everyone else, that I have no right to be calling myself "stupid" or anything of the sort when I also happen to be mad at myself. I am also rude and unfriendly and you could probably toss in more unpleasant qualities to make an evil Lydia salad.   I do not understand her or her sudden impulse to start mothering me and telling me everything I am doing wrong--from her point of view, no less! Dude, I'm sorry if it's junior year and if life is getting harder and harder for all of us, and we all have to complain, and I can't say that all of us are civil to each other all of the time. But I see no reason for catty notes and bitchfight-esque emails. Honestly, I think the whole situation is so immature that I will not change myself for her sake, nor will I respond. In the case that she's really itching for an angry letter of her own to read, she can just go and look in my journal. I am so terribly sorry when I just have different goals, that I'd rather be doing something else than whatever she's doing.  Obviously, I don't care what she says, for she has little right to be doing so and she cannot say herself that she is not guilty of being rude and eccentric and inconsiderate and whiny at times as well. It's stupid--never in my life have I gotten such a complete, such a childish attack on my character. Accordingly, she can go write more angry letters if it REALLY makes her feel better but it's not like I'm going to change as she wants me to and just be friends with her again only to receive more bitchiness down the line.   And so it is that I am withdrawing into my little unsociable hole. My good friends can be counted on two hands, and as the days go by I am starting to eliminate fingers. Strangely, it doesn't really bother me, for after the loss of two or three, what's another?  I've been thinking and thinking hard about the way I act, and what life really is for me. I admit that I can get carried away sometimes and I will let my worries overflow...what else do you need to know? I am nowhere near perfect and I will make my mistakes. But to be a completely nice, personable character is hell--try it for a school day. You end up thinking about exactly what is going to come out of your mouth before it escapes, and you end up censoring so much negativity. Reciprocality in petty conversations is a must, and so I find myself enquiring what classes people are taking and how they are when they ask me too, even when I don't really care. I am terribly sorry if Tiff thinks living on the edge is ok, but I'm still sticking to my method of working hard until I get something solid.  So we return to Ayn Rand. We are not born to be second-handers but to rely on ourselves. We do not labor for others selflessly. Whether you like it or not, selfishness is an essential human instinct. Forget the negative connotation--what is the point of your life when you just spend it trying to make it better for others? Utopia only exists when a) you do whatever makes you happy when b) you do not bother anyone or c) make sure others are ok with your interference in their lives. And apparently, some people aren't ok with me. Honestly, public opinion is such crap, especially if I get in trouble for wanting to do well. Yes, sometimes I may take it too far. And at this point, as long as I haven't turned every soul against me I'm ok. Don't tell me that Tiffany has never been rude to me or whined to me. As for my supposed "arrogance" and "snobbishness" or something like that, I even forget the exact wording of the charge, I do not see how I cannot come to lament how I cannot meet my goals when other people can do so freely. So what if I want to get a higher SAT score?  In the end, this is an excellent case for introversion. If nobody wants to talk to me, then fine, I'll just write to myself. I honestly don't care to associate with people who think I'm just a stuck-up POS. And I'm not even doing it for arrogance's sake! I am just unsatisfied with my work. Ok, so maybe I complain verbally. OK, SO I'LL SHUT UP NOW SO YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PEACE AND COMPLAIN TO THE REST OF YOU ABOUT WHATEVER MEDIOCRITY PLAGES YOUR LIVES.  And the stupid thing is that I should have known from the first bullying instance that some people are just power whores and that true friends are harder to come across than you really think. It's gotten to the point where you just have to come to terms with the fact that if you really can't get along with these people, they aren't meant to be your friends and that you should just   stay away   even when it means self-imposed isolation.  Then again, now I feel like such a deprived loser. I imagine all the ugly rumors going around about me and my apparent "arrogance." I imagine that behind my back heads turn shielded by cold hands, mouths whispering criticisms. And frankly, it sucks. I apparently am not allowed to voice any complaint or frustration now, so I sit there like everything's fine when it isn't. I don't have anyone to confide in--all I can do is just cry to him, angry on the phone and decide somehow that it's his fault too and then hang up and resolve to never talk to him again. Sometimes I think that it's stupid, but then again why should I be the weak one? Do I really need another person in my life who just thinks critically of me? Do I need to plant more damning evidence by talking to him? Do I need to talk to someone who's traditionally sided with Tiffany when it comes to making fun of Lydia, and not just in this case? Do I need to talk to the person who knows almost every single one of my faults and has the evidence to prove it? Maybe this destructive pattern will be broken by some extraordinary spurt of kindness or even understanding, but from experience I don't see that happening. It's so sad though. Sometimes I think I'm done with being angry and that I can try to make things normal again, but then I question myself: who am I to think that I can just regulate the relationship between people? And in whatever way you look at it, I'm probably bothering him and we've already gone through the usual motions of not talking to each other, so what is the point? According to most, I am not nearly worthy, anyways. Rare is the person who still thinks of me as if there was nothing extremely wrong.  I am tired of being sad. The problem is that I have not a soul  to be happy with.

      Reeling. Reeling in? Not really. As of tonight? No.  IB from the hospital came over today to rehearse her song. I don't blame her; she's called me more than three times and it's my obligation to anyways if I'm to play, period. Haha, I just don't know how to say it. She came with her sister, we did a runthrough. The usual awkward conversation that just makes you want to go off and hug someone or just laugh hard. Mom gets them tea. They ask me what I can play, they rack off a whole bunch of contemporary contemporary music--"classical" as we know it is going to the dogs. I can't play any, except to pick out some lame tunes. Then they ask me to play, I do a messy rendition of the Ravel (still under construction) and I don't know whether to feel stupid or that I've outsmarted them. Then Bach. And then practice again, and then adios. What am I to say? Define "boor" for me. But no, that word looks too menacing and outright mean.  So maybe tonight I understand some things better, but maybe tonight I don't want to understand them at all. Well, I asked for it, and this is what I get, and if I'm anything less than satisfied then I'm a spoiled brat. Well, more than one thing today has proven that. Somehow I just want to call "RETREAT," turn the army around and return home to someone. Someone I trust.  Thanks, A, for the CD. I'm still listening to it. Too bad it brings back too many icky, questionable memories, but I need to cope with it.  A watercolor day, friends in and out. Strange truths. True, though. And what more can I ask?

      You know that a journal's not a journal anymore when you start censoring yourself for your audience.  Just got back home from Enid's "Saturday dinner." For some unexplained reason, walking up the driveway was the strangest thing tonight. It's not like I've never done it--I can keenly remember walking down with Z and walking up with D ("Oh man, look at those stars!") but tonight it was the most deliberate walk up to the door. I know it's not right, but every time I think of the front door I'm inclined to recall things...  And once in a while, I'll look back at the picture. There's a reason why I've spent so much (too much, in retrospect) on that dress and then never wore it again, even for silly little stints in front of the mirror when I have too much time on my hands. There's me, with my hair up and blending with the darkness all around, my hands clutching my jacket with the corsage around my wrist, and laughing so hard (from what?) into his chest and his facial expression is a startled one, with the beginnings of a smile for the save. There's some reason why it bothers me still, why I much prefer to admire the one of T and me, same night, same clothes. Maybe it's paranoia (I still convince myself that I did something wrong that night) and I just hate that the picture epitomizes and broadcasts some deep-seated fear--truth, in my mind.  And someone's on the phone tonight. "Hi________, I'm on the phone." And I remember with a frustrated chuckle what I used to do on the phone. I'm glad it's past me, but I just embarrass myself remembering nights on balconies leaning against the rails staring at Tercero C or the other buildings, looking up at the blasted windows of the bathroom and TALKING. Forever. Until stern faces appear in the windows and tell me that it's curfew and I'd better walk the two feet back into my room. What did we use to talk about? What we wanted to do in twenty years. Everything. And maybe that was the closest they ever got to suggesting the one thing that would make me so terrifically happy (or so I thought, at the time). Sprinklers, plates, classes, familiy. And even at home, leaning against the drawers and telling them that I felt scared or stpuid or insecure or just little things to get it out of my system: "I had a dream about you last night."  So E's birthday dinner. Went to Sesame Inn, which is a small place off Wendy in NP...I'm sure I've heard Mom mention it before, but I guess I've never paid much attention. A very small establishment. Cozy. Not the best dinner table conversation ever, but it'll do...what more can I expect? The park across the street from OPHS afterwards for cake and key lime bars, made last night with J. Bitter cold. And then walking home. And you know something's wrong when you're already imagining what you'll write down before you get home.  Things go in circles.  It's hard to tell myself that I'd been having way too much fun before and that I'd better get it in my system now that it's not going to continue much longer. There are just some things, I guess, that I just can't bring myself to accept and the more I hold on, the lamer I feel. Tales of intrigue and betrayal, lol.  I'm thinking "worn-out shoe" now, but that's Chinese slang for prostitute. Maybe that'd be appropriate in this circumstance, too. OH, the scrapes I get myself into.

      Under the pretense of homework or some such official matter, I'm sitting here "late" and inputting.  Haha. E, J and I made your *birthday pie* tonight. lol, and we did all the wrong things. To keep the filling secret (for I've already revealed that the mysterious object in question is a pie) I'll keep the screwups in the dark for now, but we'll share stories later. Some good conversation with J. It's funny how different people can fill different niches: N is my big brother (and T my big sister), K and A are my smart friends, C and S are just plain hilarious, E is the disgruntled Asian girl with a lot on her mind...and J happens to be my material/emotional desires vent--maybe without severe emotional input on my part, though.  And I think, despite it all, she'll be ok. So maybe I overcalculated her insecurities and her troubles and in trying to help (not that I'm very good at consolation) I've discovered that she's pretty much a normal human being who just tends to freak out sometimes when there's a lot to do--but I do that too, in a quieter sort of way. Sexy German boy and secret loves and all, she'll survive, and I almost want to hit myself for thinking that she was in dire straits because she so wanted someone (or so I read) when she's not that bad. I think we have a little of that in all of us, and it's probably healthy for it's kept my mind from roving to different dimensions. Kept me sane.  I think we made her mother mad, though. Who wouldn't, when you come home to a mixer running on high for ten minutes straight?  I seriously hope MT isn't a reason for Mom and Dad to get on my case again. Well, they already have: it's SAT II classes again on the bargaining table, and I'm not giving in quite yet. It's sick, though. Why can't I like be K, who scores an 800 now and then on practice tests and then hits 1600 on test day? Maybe I'm inflating my nonexistent mental ability, but it's not like I haven't done that before. The scariest thing, though, is actually deciding that you're going to forego the afternoon sessions with Mr. J and then get a test score back that is, according to the parents (isn't everything?), less than satisfactory. For the longest time, I was happy with what I had on the SAT I, but I guess S and T's results make me change my mind. Ninety points. Is it worth Saturday afternoons? How well do I know the material, and how well do I know myself?  I wish I could mishmash words so they meant two things at once: one meaning to get people speculating, the other the truth.   Satisfaction prevails.

      To save myself from ersatz happiness, these are the things I'm happy about today:  RAVEL, I love you. It gets my fingers going and man, it's a masterpiece. It makes me want to hum off-key and dance with arms up in the air even with all the messy screw ups. And I got it back just in a day, despite four months of not playing it (four months?).   THAT VONS TURKEY BACON GUACAMOLE SANDWICH. Oh man, J, that was good while we had it. And remember the picketers who told us we could get extra meat at Ralphs? Compared to Quizno's today, that one was perfect. I believe it's time to go on another pilgrimage for that holy sandwich.  PAJAMA PANTS. need I say more?  FRIED RICE, straight from LA. Pineapple in it too. And Hong Kong-style noodles  GOOD TV. Speaking of which...

      I've spent too much time reading everyone else's blogs.  Ever since I IMed him about finals results I've kind of been talking to R again. It's one of those things that you don't really care about or think about either. But then K IMs me randomly with the PM assignments and I don't even need them since I already have them. I think they're really close now. Good, maybe that's better for the both of them. I don't care. And after a good month of sitting here and brewing hatred from all the silly bad things that have happened to me, I'm way past that stage. (involuntary shudder). I'm glad it's enough stupid stuff to make me forget about the journal and all the signs that I was too ignorant to see.  I need to start reading again. K keeps on bugging me about the Shipping News and now Arranged Marriage. I've been dying to read the Da Vinci Code, and what I wouldn't give to spend another afternoon just browsing at B&N...haha, but remember the questionable stuff they put at the beginning of fiction last time I checked with N?  SEVENTH PLACE. I don't know what to say. And the most terrible thing was that they jsut started arranging the end-of-MT party at meeting's end. How stupid is that? Nobody's going to sit there and think about how we screwed up or how we could change. Maybe it's not necessary, but I don't know--that was the way I intended to cope. SEVENTH PLACE. How freaking lame is that?  But I've been too pessimistic lately. Funny thing is that I can read it in the people around me. It's justified, yes, since reactions from people don't seem to hurt me, but perhaps it's time I've just felt better about things? I mean, I can see that there's so many things to be happy about right now, but MT steals the spotlight.  And then I have the theory that such happiness cannot last, for how do we define happiness without sadness? Is it time to return to normalcy to better appreciate happiness when it comes around again?  I miss sitting up in bed and writing.  Happy birthday, E!

      Knowledge is powerful, and the wrong kind can upset a lot of things.  It's just--there are things that I probably would have been better off with had I just not known certain things, if I'd not connected the dots. Are there definitive dots? Lines? The two?

      Yes, I am done philosophizing for the night. Or so I convince myself.  We're not going to finals. There, I said it. Don't ask me about it. Please.  And I've just realized, after conversation, that I can't stop. Everywhere you go people'll ask you how you did and you'll have to sheepishly reveal that you were as pathetic as to not make it to the top four teams, as you've done for the past few years. It just doesn't feel like a mock trial this year. From personal experience, I've come to associate the whole entire final lap, shall we say, with the stuffy jury assembly room and all of us in our white collared shirts, having already taken off our jackets. We're standing and sitting in the back row, as we always are, and we hold hands and look at each other: "This is it." And when they annouce that Westlake has made finals, we all toss our arms up in the air and hug and kiss random people because we're so amazingly happy and nobody gives a care.  But now, it's computers, the "insurmountable computer error," and a rainy afternoon. And not making finals.  I will not philosophize.  I feel almost the same way I felt when Nick died. I know it's not comparable at all, really, in terms of magnitude, but I'm still sitting here with the Burberry on and sometimes I just have to make myself think: hey, am I supposed to be crying here? am I supposed to be grieving? Should I assess what mock trial meant to me and what I feel now that it's over and done for this year?  And then again I will steal away from this compulsory grief and find the strangest solace--in piano, of all places. All I need now, I think, is just the casual somberness of the Szyumanowski, the confusion (and the sloppiness that stems from it) of the Ravel, the elegant Schumann. It's funny: I haven't found this kind of peace in a long time, and I have forgotten how it feels to get your fingers worked up, to just get carried away.  It's raining hard now. I think I could almost enjoy it if my contacts weren't threatening to pop out and if I had that same kind of satisfaction inside me as I should feel when the rain is falling outside and I know that I am safe and dry.  I need to do a lot of thinking tonight, too. I'm already behind in schoolwork, but I think that will be solved with a little extra diligence, and it's time I got back into the rhythm before I am too tempted to forego school altogether for reasons of "illness." I would like to go to finals tomorrow night and just sit there and take notes. I don't know if there's anyone else who even cares enough, and already I can imagine a few who won't bother to show tomorrow night at the courthouse. I don't know if I can skip orchestra, but I think it'd just make me feel better if I went, though I cannot afford to play the role of snubbed competitor.  In four days, I have felt two kinds of peace. Peace tonight knowing that it's done with and there's nothing more to be done. I know there's the second part of that feeling, that "what did I do wrong?," but for now, I'll just leave it be. And peace in the security of being around people who mean, strangely, more to you than you expected. And truly, this time.  I know such things don't last, for I wouldn't be able to appreciate these things without proper tumult, but tonight I'll accept what I have.  Keep me strong.

      Mock trial rounds 1 and 2 tonight.  Three days a year, I put on the suit and the makeup and do the hair and try to transform into the kind of dynamic individual that makes the judges smile and the teammates cheer. Today was to be one of those days, and now as I sit here munching on surprisingly good cookies I wonder how effective I was.  According to the debriefing the coaches gave us, we're fighting for our lives to stay in finals. Buena, La Reina, Camarillo and TO are all competent teams, and only four can compete again Thursday. I just know that we can't afford to be that one team that works our butts off but doesn't make it past round 4. I just won't let it happen because I know I've put a lot in emotionally and physically and it just negates everything I do if we can't even make it to FINALS. I just don't want to be standing there tomorrow night holding hands and dying from suspense because "Westlake" happens to be the last team alphabetically and then finding out that we didn't make it. So there's Buena, Camarillo, La Reina and TO. Hm. Still very much wiggle room, and we won't be able to tell where we are from what comes before us.  I just want everyone to go home and decide what it is that they need to fix and come to competition tomorrow with a determined and fierce attitude. We can make it to finals. We just need to pull everything together. We need to choose our battles when it comes to objections, we need to memorize perfectly openings and closings, we need to get the genders down, we need to smile and sparkle and attack and defend. We can't sniffle or laugh or frown or vacillate or back down, DAMNIT.  And I preach too much.  And sometimes things tell me that I should just drop everything and put what I have into mock trial. That means no obsessing over minute details in school, no obsessing over people, no obsessing over piano...oww, that one hurts in particular.  You're adorable, C, but would life be easier if I gave you up for three days?

      Sunday morning and rain is truly falling.  I promised C an optimistic entry yesterday, lol, so I'll try to keep it as light as possible.  Except the sun just came out, which frustrates me.  So much has happened in the past two days that it's just overwhelming. So we'll just start with Friday.  YSP reunion. First time flying alone. I remember getting out of the car at the airport was more difficult than saying byes to Mom and Dad over the summer, and I just can't explain why. Burbank Airport has that retro brown feel, which I don't really like. I bought a copy of the New Yorker and sat down, waiting for the plane. 7:05 flight, needless to say, wasn't too full. Rode the 8:22 bus to Davis, waited at the MU for AM and S to come, and then L and K and S and S and S and C and D. Had breakfast with a few of them, R came. Tried to visit the lab with K but ended up getting a sweatshirt instead and getting picked up by a white van (R, thank God) to go to the Graduate. Lunch there, met up with M and V and everyone else, I guess. A didn't show up, and I'm sad. Apparently Greyhounding didn't work too well for him.  Everyone's still the same, which disappoints me. C and D are still close friends, R and S (who dyed her hair and got braces) are still so tight that their circle excludes all other YSPers except, maybe, the twins. M is still shy, AM and S still combine forces for an overwhelming silliness (strange for girls who are probably going to Stanford and Harvard, respectively) and that cliquey kind of feel that always makes you wonder if they're whispering something about you. Truthfully, I don't think I enjoyed that lunch very much. It was just them goofing off or K and M and S talking about Science Olympiad. The only appropriate response (since I couldn't come up with material for either SO or something outlandish to keep up with the girls) was to laugh. I can do that, but it just doesn't show that I'm on the same level as everyone else.  Well, I don't know what I was expecting, but it was still a weird feel. K and I walked the route from the MU (and Hunt, etc.) back to Tercero, which brought back so many memories for me. I just wish I had all the girls arranged in the halls again...that, I think, is the genuine YSP feel. I can just picture a Sunday morning and arranging to go to the Old Teahouse or something with I and S and L and K and M...that kind of thing, not a lunch with the soches.  And then K's mom R picked me up from the Graduate. I love her mom; she's the kind I want to have. She's been on all sorts of adventures, and apparently her mom didn't really take care of her so she decided to do a better job with K. It's funny--I could talk to her the whole entire time, from the Graduate to the B&N in Fairfield to Yo Sushi across from K's high school.  So we met up with K, who had her exchange student from MA and her friend S and other exchange students, I guess. Went to the mall, ate at Quizno's and Coldstone, got back to the airport. I guess words can't exactly describe that feel of that afternoon.  Saturday. MT in the morning. Baja Fresh with C at lunch, who told me I was weird...and he still won't tell me why. Practice at Harrison's sister's house, memorizing openings, setting socks on fire, coziness and loveliness. J told them about the J&C joke, and they still don't get it.  Haha, and here I don't feel like writing anymore because I need to memorize that opening and do Huck Finn and the chapter summary and everything in between, lol. Jack Johnson, here I come.  See, I need to be riled up to write something monumental. I'm just drinking chicken soup here, so I'm relatively calm. Never fear, I'll be back.

      What was that quote from Jane Eyre during the Helen death scene about bearing what you have to bear? I feel like that today.  So I get to school in the morning and first thing I get is crazy ranting from Jess: "Mrs. Battaglia's taking my Lo-Lo away! She's taking all the journalists and I won't let you go! No, no no...etc." And I didn't undrstand what the heck was going on. And she wouldn't stop yapping and pretty soon I got frustrated. Hah. So Mrs. Battaglia herself comes in and explains (in a comparatively lucid manner) that I have to go down and interview Dick van Dyke.   I don't know him, but I watched Mary Poppins ages ago and I suppose I've heard some of his songs in my lifetime, but he's another affable old man with white hair and smiling eyes. I wish all grandpas could be like that. Got his autograph, but Mrs. Battaglia has it now.  Bearing.  It rained today. Girls in flip flops (me) and skirts (not me) struggling in the wet weather, complaining of the cold and the dampness and the inconvenience and the ruined hairdo. It's amazing how much we complain. You think of starting a conversation with someone and it'll most likely be some sort of complaint that the other party sympathizes with. I complain profusely in here. I complain in my journal. I complain to my friends, to authority, in my head.  Counting white blood cells in physio. Kill me if I have to be a lab technician twenty years hence, for I can't stand looking in microscopes for vague blue blobs in a sea of red specks and identifying which kind of vague blue blob that particular vague blue blob is.  So off-season tennis. I say something to T. She turns around: "OH MY GOD!" I think it's something serious. She continues, "I CAN'T HEAR YOU WHEN YOU MUMBLE LIKE THAT! SPEAK UP!" and she goes on to say how she can't hear me in mock trial and blah blah blah. I just wanted to cry, but I just laugh now because that's the way I'll deal with it and it's a petty little thing. Not what I needed at that point, needless to say. I just wanted to crumple up and yell...nobody else has that problem. Or at least they don't OH MY GOD! me about it. But perhaps the problem is in that nobody ever tells me. It all comes back to mock trial, too. After E decided not to join this year and after I stopped talking to R and everything, I just sit there during the lulls in the proceedings and I just sit there. Personally, if I were alone and not talking to anyone I wouldn't mind (but then again, who would?) but I just don't like it. There's something isolationist and antisocial and just flat out LONER about stuff like that, and it irritates me.   What if they look at me as they do M? What if they get together in their posses and comment on my dress, my behavior, my opinions? What if they said "You know, I've tried hard, but there's nothing I can find to like about that Lydia," like J said about M. I don't fit a niche. I'm not the bitch--A fills that role in the "servant" sense and J does in the "tough female" sense--nor the coquettish ones, as the H's are, or the wisecracking ones, as L and M are, or the ones who just prefer to be alone. J and A and G--the seniors--will talk about their things. It's funny that it starts to irritate me now, of all times. But whose fault is it? will things change when LYDIA SPEAKS UP?  Thinking of many things. Holding on tight. SUCKING IT UP. Not a suck-up.  It's kind of strange explaining to the likes of K and A that maybe I've decided to alter my fundamental beliefs a bit. Wow, that sounded too high and mighty. I used to be the type of person like I or S or just someone who lived for school, who centered universes around that institution that means less and less to me every day. I laugh at those people now, particularly the socially inept ones (A reports that the trainee at Los Robles last week--S--was putting down love. "It has to be devotion, not attraction," he said. Would I have said that too just six months ago? I don't care about love now. Whatever happens happens, even if it's just casual little attractions. I know it's not going to hit me now, so why bother?). I observe their defiant anti-mainstream behavior.   And I cringe to think that I was once someone like that. Don't deny it, I was, and it only helps to recognize it. Living with regret.  So I'm still not happy with that #2 in math or the #4 in English, but what will I do now? I still have the desire to stick it through and do well; I'm not giving up completely. But while life passes me by, I just want to go out and ENJOY MYSELF, even if it means sacrificing that sacrosanct A+ for an A.  You see, I've been lucky to see more well-rounded people in my life than I ever will. Please don't think there are many well-rounded people within the confines of stuffy Westlake High School. I want to be able to just sparkle and shine, I guess, to be that one girl that everyone respects but still considers very approachable. Progress in my case is visible, but still, I suspect, not as significant as J preached. I know what I'm talking about, do you? That pretty, on-top-of-things Asian girl who has a healthy social life and supportive friends, who excels in academics and in extracurriculars, who, above all, has an invincible sense of self-confidence and control.  And that's the ambition that separated me from the hardcore nerds? OH please.

      Comments don't work. Just so you all know.  little mental list of things to do before school tomorrow morning:  shower spanish studying math hw (kind of)  some english that's not that bad, really oh yes, and pack a lunch  Little miscellaneous things happened today that I don't quite care to explain at this hour, i.e. buttons that don't stay. Busy day today, as usual: hospital volunteering (Betty, bless her, still calls me "Lily"), MT.   Yes, MT. They're cracking down, but I don't know if it'll be enough in time for competition. I hope it doesn't come down to losing a FINALS spot now by fractions of points. I haven't tasted that kind of failure yet, and I hope to God I won't have to any time soon. I just feel that everyone could improve. It means introspection and finding all the little weak points that need to be bolstered. Mental witness run-through: M, I think, still needs work in not looking so awfully dull, A needs to brighten up too. C needs more exaggeration. It's all about acting, people. I just wish there was some sort of gauge, a way to see quantitatively how much we suck. I know it's just not the right mentality, and I wish I wasn't that stupid to think that. We just need a good pep talk.  And because of major schedule conflicts, they're thinking of removing R next year. Serves him right, I guess...I won't say any more at this point except that I'm glad that I didn't have to miss too much this year. E's thinking of doing MT again, which will be a help.  Just MT on my mind. Obligations. What I wouldn't give for a good Baja Burrito right now.  I just need more faith.

      In my book, it's a perfect afternoon: gray sky, slight chill. A and H are coming at 5 and I somehow have to finish piano by 9:15, which I'm not too thrilled about, but these things have to get done.   It's sad that piano has become such a small priority, but it just demands so much energy that I wonder how it ever happened before. I am chronically pooped, and often I don't want to play. It's the strongest obligation in me...it's like compulsion to eat broccoli for your own good, raised exponentially to some arbitrarily large power.   Sleepy day. Mock trial in the morning, hw to do now. Food, perhaps.  I've come from being the most conservative girl to what? a flirt, a whore? or so J says. It's bizarre the way things have been going, but to say the least, I'm really backing off and in no way am I the jealous one. How in the world did Julia think she'd be hurting my feelings? Doesn't she realize that I always look like that?   Hm, some serious pondering on my plate.

      Downloads, finally, are ok on my computer again. Needless to say, the first thing I reclaimed from the dl world was AIM, and it's a relief to actually have a profile and to see the icons and have some sort of font. And now I'm tempted to reorganize my buddy list. Problem is, how would I do it? Like T, with "best friends" and then descending in social importance from there? (That list always bugs me every time I go to her house...I wonder if I'm on there, lol) But friends can't be categorized like that, and I'd just feel like I was offending someone if I didn't put them in that position. A separate category for YSP? Yes, perhaps. We'll see how it goes.  I wonder how one deals with truancies at school. I'm angry, though: Mom forgot to call me out of 7th period on time so I ended up helping with roses and cutting class in the process. Not too pleasant. She says she called the office after the fact and they said that I was supposed to get a slip before I left, but a) if Mom didn't call in, how was I supposed to have a list? and b) I've left my last class many a time--legally--and I haven't gone to the office to get that bothersome sheet of paper. Isn't that only for readmits? Well, I'm fervently hoping that I don't get a Saturday. Imagine how absolutely disgusting that would be. I thought about it...in retalliation, I'm going to write a column in the paper about it.  Charles, please explain the poem :)

      Righto (really?). Happy belated Valentine's Day.  Well, today was supposed to be some big pianofest but I haven't gotten around to it just yet, unfortunately. Panel is March 6. I have mock trial right before then and I keep telling myself that I can't afford to cram. But now I think of it, March 6 seems awfully far away...at least comfortably so.  One of the best Valentine's Days ever yesterday. Or perhaps it was just so damn good because it was actually living, actually being out with friends and laughing so hard your sides hurt, squirming as you get tickled from both sides. Shopping with A and C and W and D, and then just driving around for food until we arrived at Baja Fresh. Hanging out with A and C at A's house afterwards, getting 6 phone calls from a set of hyper-worried parents. Life gets better and better.  So yes, I am high on some miracle drug, and that miracle drug is life. I'm thankful that such things have improved for the better all of a sudden--I certainly wasn't expecting it. Yes, it's time I grew up; I'm tired of being 15 already.

      straight from S's profile:  After much thought and life experience I have discovered that 1+1=2....most of the time. See mathematicians have neglected the fact that sometimes the first 1 likes the second 1 and when you add them together you get a really BIG 1. Sometimes however the first 1 likes the second 1 but the second 1 doesn't reciprocate (share) the feelings so you are left with 1+1=.5+.5+1 since the first 1 is broken up over rejection. So next time you are asked what 1+1 equals think about it!  (for all you in Calc BC you could take the intigral of 1+1 get 2x and realize that now you have even more problems)

      When--how--why do people cross the line between caring and not caring? What makes the difference between just seeing people and then really seeing them? What activates the mechanism that makes your hands tug at shirts, to draw in for a kiss? I've often loved myself for not having to rely on other mercurial souls for happiness, but now? Somehow I am so surrounded by people who enjoy life, who epitomize felicity in comfy wuss rock and rides in cars that this euphoria seems to seep into my own pores. I have yet to learn to deal with it, but perhaps that's for the better. I don't know if I should feel jealous or loved or just take the old amused spectator stance.  I can't believe they're doing what they're doing in MT. I have one of J's songs stuck in my head, and I just remember this morning as a cloudy day with that clangy music and a whole bunch of craziness from fatigue. J and C, yes, that will be a good one to watch unfold. Apparently, they're keeping it from A and M because one will naturally spill and the other one is, quote unquote, too stupid. It's supposed to be some big joke to get back at the two cackly ladies who are so intent on screwing around (or, in harsher terms, fucking with) our lives. Naturally, it almost irritates me too in light of what happened and why. I hate to think of myself as resentful because I probably brought it on myself, and it will just be another emotional salad for me. Ah yes, salads, like the one almost spilled, the one...  I realized just this morning as I stepped into the shower that today's Friday the 13th. And then I turned around and didn't think it was so bad since it's only two months until I can celebrate being 16. The way people perceive things.  Perhaps it's for the better, but I don't even know R anymore. I think of it in terms of what he wears: he will have new shirts that I've never seen before, and it doesn't bother me anymore. I'm surprised that I could ever give someone up so completely, but then again it was for the better and I'm much saner and much happier without it. Got a sadistic kick out of going home with J and just seeing him standing at the foot of the bridge while everyone said their goodbyes and went home...  What, I ask, makes people tick?

      Ok, ok, so I'm updating again.  I am drained. Very drained. This week has basically been the type when you're out all day doing a whole bunch of assorted, mandatory things and you just don't have enough time to slow down and sleep and eat and be normal. But I shall be ok now, I think. It's Thursday and it's the last day of the week and I might as well be happy early, for I have four more days of happiness--at least, when happiness is defined by no school.  I wish I had something witty and observant to say, except now I've just realized that this week has been so devoid of that lovely empty time to think that I can't say anything lucid at the moment. I hope this fatigue isn't a disease. I'll be sitting in the back of journalism and it's not even noon and I'll tell J I'm tired already. Is it anemia? Some exotic deficiency?  So yes. Sitting here, I ponder about my excessive consumption of food today (overcompensation for lack of sleep?) and recount the contents of my stomach: Apple Jacks, a burrito, lo bo gao, a sandwich, juice, yogurt, Triscuit, two pieces of candy, a whole bottle of water...no wait, I'm not dysfunctional. I wish there was some good brainless TV fodder so I could perch on the couch and watch for a while. And looking at the YSP brochure for this year, just laugh that in a week I'll be flying solo to Sacramento.  The A situation (and now it sounds formal, damnit) seems like it was a while ago. I almost hate to think that just three days ago I was curious to go back to school to see how things turned out, and now I'm almost ambivalent and ready to explain anything, almost, in a level tone. It's just so difficult to connect the goofy kid who doesn't realize something's funny until two seconds after everyone else has finished laughing and the kid who treated me to one of the best times ever. But you know, I'm totally ok with that too. Erum's finally home, and she helped put things in perspective: it wasn't like I could force myself into liking him anyways and I'm just stuck on this still because it's never happened before. Valentine's Day is fast approaching, and I think I'm all right with that one too. I'll marvel at K's flowers and B's ring and J's necklace, but I'm glad I realize that maybe it's not my turn yet and I'm going to accept it. I'm not going to force myself into feeling pathetic and unloved, for the truth is, I'm happy when I'm around friends and that's probably all I can handle at this point given my crazy schedule.  But someone isn't ok with it. I saw S today, who is accused of being gay. I talked to T about it too, and she also wondered how she could attach herself with such immediacy to him and expect him to take her to the dance after talking to him in person twice. From my point of view, how could she dare expect such a thing? And she's going after (and here I leave a blank for her sake) now. I don't know what to say to her. Part of me wants to be the jealous teenage girl and withhold what I have of it from her. I am very tempted to be, for again, how could she embark on such a mission when she barely even talks to him? She's said many a time before that she's not happy about V-day. Ok, that's fine with me, but should she keep complaining about it? There are plenty of upstanding peers without significant others who are COMPLETELY FINE about not doing something romantic on Feb. 14. I just don't understand her sudden desire to get a guy. And I begin to wonder (and with unintentional malice) how she expects to get the guy when she doesn't even talk to them very much, when she always gets incredibly flustered and worried and just hasn't let loose yet?  But maybe I have to ask these things of myself, too.  I just hope that whoever has a date for Valentine's Day will enjoy themselves thoroughly, to feel that little bit of magic, the little bit of secret happiness that they'll look back on again and again.

      God damnit, my stomach hurts. But it's not like I'm going to tell mom or anything...I'll just get another lecture on regular eating. I've had enough of those already, I think.  Katy...if you're checking this, we're not going to Genetech, so it's probably going to be pickup from the Graduate. I have to have a written note from the parents, though, lol...or so Dr. Pomeroy says. Hope you're having fun.  Rejection isn't fun, on the other hand. No, not so much rejection. More like resignation. I think of that episode of the last season of Sex and the City where Mr. Big gets that operation and opens his heart up to Carrie, only to close it again. I didn't realize it was open--or at least as open as I could ever wish it could be. No, it's not rejection. It's just not being savvy enough to realize that that was probably the best time I could ever have and not taking advantage of it. What I would give to live those moments again, to make more of it!  For some reason, I just want to attach something lovely to that first kiss. I don't want to look back years later and remember that it was but a momentary fling. I wanted it to be something serious and something true and something real. And then I think, it was there, what more could I ask for?  So I thought I was in love and now, out of it, I realize truly how out of it I am. A is just A once again, the guy who's still doing his math hw during practice, who's kind of lost somewhere out there. I just wonder what happened between crush for a year and daring to kiss and just there now. I was right, though. I never deserved someone like that and it was just a fancy, and just for one night. Is that what guys will do when they're asked to be nice, though? Or was it something more?  But I miss it.  So mock trial hell begins soon, and I'm just waiting for it to take over my life. I have too much to do at this time of year, and I'll just savor the moments before the avalanche.  Charles, stop being gay.

      yay, so the blog works again.  It's about 7-ish Sunday morning (if T were here we'd break out into song: "Sunday morning rain is falling..."). I've just decided that I can't sleep. My hair is like straw and arranged accordingly, I probably still have makeup on from last night. Well. I just don't know what to feel right now. It was all that I could ask for, and then it wasn't. I laughed in bed this morning: I listened to grandma and didn't go for a guy who wasn't more into me than I was into him, but I still feel like I missed out on something.  A lot of firsts last night--but I'm determined not to add a broken heart to that list. With luck, I'll always be resilient and strong.  Damn it. Today I actually want to talk to Harrison and Julia. Today I actually wish Charles was online so I could spill, hear "tu eres mi tesoro" and all the Ave Maria lyrics again. Today I wish there were more people to kiss, more laughter to be made, more closeness and...not firsts.  I laugh at myself now: how could I ever think it could be such a big deal? But this is one of the rare times when I am too willing to reach out of my shell for someone else.  Mock trial Big Bear retreat? lol. That, I swear, was a separate thought entirely.  Ave Maria, cuando seras mia?

      Estoy muriendo de cansancio.   This, folks, is my first day this week where I don't actually have to DO anything except homework. Journalism's done, and I'm really happy at how the front page turned out even if the other news pages are a bit dull. I like it--maybe it's a little more interesting than the static two-story format, but the continued's were annoying. Mock trial won't happen again until the end of this week, which is so completely ok with me. We need some sort of spark, some sort of spirit...blast it, I'm going both days, even if it's only work with the witnesses.  So tonight it's the rest of Bailey and a style analysis essay and that portfolio chart. Not that all assignments weren't given to me two weeks ago, but...  This is one of the happiest times this entire school year despite too many things to do and a general aching fatigue. I still can't believe that it's all mine, though. And people come up to me and ask if it's true, and sometimes I start to wonder, is it? Is it so out of the ordinary that it invites such questions?   More later...K's online! haha

      I think I'm done recording for that CD, though I hope I won't have separate thoughts about it when I go through it tomorrow. It's all right, I guess. I just love that sweaty, active feeling you get when you're going through that last triumphant section. I know I'll never be as good as some of the people out there, but we can only dream.  So you might say I feel like Steinbeck on finishing Grapes of Wrath: "I hope they like it."

      I just had the weirdest feeling.  Between daydreaming and thinking of an antonym for TO EFFACE, EXTIRPATE, ROOT OUT I get this sense that everything's going to be all right. Sudden, brief nirvana. And many thanks to however this happened. It's just been a crazy day.   I went to bed early last night with that stomachache and thought ok, I'll get my six hours and wake up around 3. Didn't happen, but I don't think you even needed to guess. Physio: we hyperventilate and get dizzy and breathe into paper bags. "SUCK IT HARDER, LYDIA!" says Bowman. I think I'm the only one who doesn't get it until J brought it up again in history. Nigel can't stop laughing. Besides suspicious activities with the ruler, I think he's just about the best lab partner ever. And the funniest thing: he's going to do anatomy if he gets in, so I guess the rest of us--Wendy, Sabrina, Nimo, Erum and I--will do it too. All I have to do now is cross my fingers and hope that at least one of them end up in my lab group.  But this "everything's going to be ok" act will take a little more convincing. It's already 5:41. I just came home and ate and took care of some recycling bin business and vocab, and here I am now. I'm going to record Ravel tonight and see if the microphone will be a little more sensitive to dynamic contrast in the Bach. Ravel actually didn't sound so bad, but it needs to be cleaner, as always. I have a few math homeworks to do. Hey, I don't want to complain, but I wish I could just get school over with and go out on the weekends instead of having to stress over competitions and journalism and soreness, among other things. Junior year hurts.   And I still have to write that column for B. Hm.

      PAIN, oh dizzying pain. Right now, Austin would say it best: ?Te duele el estomago? Si, mucho. So now I know that an Orange Dream Machine isn't enough to take me through a mile and three hours of roaming the halls of Los Robles. Nor will a chili dog, pasta and pie (all in a questionable state) keep you feeling somewhat ok. I wish I could cuss it out. Or sleep on it. Anything but this dehabilitating pain. Duck. It hurts so much I'm getting a headache.  And I can't think anymore right now.

      ADD. I still have to do whatever homework I mentioned before. And that quarter foccacia sandwich is beginning to sound good.  "I know it's not a party if it happens every night."  At this odd hour, I look at my arm and I all of a sudden marvel at flesh and bone. And existence. And I think, wait, this isn't right. I'm still here, why bother? And God takes out his trident...and spears me. I'm beginning to sound like Erum, half asleep. "Altar, English homework." I like the static and the crackle and the craziness and just sitting here, so tired but so in awe.  I am counting friends again. It's insane. Are friends just people you can talk to and talk to? Are they the ones who hold me up no matter what mood I'm in? Are they the ones who write and write and write to me when I write to them? How do you lose them? When you cut them off, is that final?   Per Battaglia's observation, Lydia gets vulgar when it's late and she's stressed. So I am a comfort whore. Anything for just feeling all right again when I'm upset. IT could be in the form of someone--some people--I rarely talk to, or food, or just writing in this odd collection of thoughts.

      I don't know. Maybe that's the best thing to say right now?  Piano is frustrating me. That goes without saying, perhaps. Bach is recorded, but the mike can't pick up dynamic differneces, so I probably sound like an idiot. All the dynamic patterns gone. And I have to work up Ravel again so at least it's clean...that'll be quite a task. All this for what? I really wish I could play C's Chopin like she played it Sunday--no, Saturday. Clean, fluid, artful. Should I be practicing Bach now? I can play it, but mental demons will invade my solidity and just screw me up. Artful. Very.  It just bothers me: I don't care about the hoja rosada in Spanish, I really don't care about the math test, and I probably just have to do vocab review in English. All I want is a clean Ravel and a clean Bach for a competition where just the sight of the application annoys me.  So we question: what is important to us? The most comfortable form of work for me right now would be to sit down with a pile of notecards and just study for the AP's...or write. Not piano, not homework.  mm, and I'm back. Homework is less than appealing. Funny priorities I have. I might as well grab the hoja rosada and just start working.

      ARRRRRRRRRRRRRGH. Just a good pirate growl would do me some good right now.  After cradling my heavy head in my hands, I realize they smell like a caucasian man. It's the soap. The rest of the house kind of smells like durian and stagnant air, neither very pleasant.  I opened up Outlook waiting for recycling bin manufacturers and I get the email from Mr. Francis. It's time for the Leni Fe Bland Auditions again. It's almost like an anatomy app in its lengthiness but this time around I know it's serious: I probably need to talk to Mr. Benson for an application letter and that probably will be lukewarm. And I have to generate a repertoire list. And record a CD. I'll talk to Mr. Francis today, but it's due THIS FRIDAY. Postmarked, at least, which means I'll have to email Mr. Benson ASAP and start recording. It's lame, but I don't know what to play. I have Bach, which should be fine since it's required anyways, but what else? Szumanowski is too short. Ravel was torn up last Thursday...well, I guess I could play it without those difficult technical changes. What else do I have? ooh, Beethoven. Or Chopin. But neither of those were ever top-quality.   Auditions, if I get in, are early June.  Do I want to be doing this anyways? A long time ago I thought yes, this is what I should do, it's another scholarship for college if I get it, but it just seems to come at the wrong time. It's after a whole entire month of all too much piano and right before Bach. Arrrrrrrrrr.  Really really tired right now just because it's hot outside. Which reminds me: Dad called me into the kitchen the other night to ask me when I was getting out of school, going to Harvard, going back to school, etc. And I'm like, no, you guys can go on vacation without me. And then Dad says, "Would you like to go to Hong Kong?" Hah. Now I'm torn. I wish I could have it both ways, but I'm still going to take Harvard, I suppose. Must order plane tickets: I can't let you down, Charlie.  With luck, I won't succumb to sleep before piano lesson.

      Forever revising. But I think that's the good, solid feeling that comes from the writing process.  Maybe the thing I want most now isn't company, and it takes something jarring to realize that. I can't explain my quiet moods, but they come. And all I want to do is sit up in my room and listen to music and do homework or write or something, at least. Or I will keep mental journals in my head as I go along, like thinking of things while  brushing my teeth, walking the halls at Los Robles. It's always noise. I've stopped using it as an apostrophe, thank goodness. And the paradox is that whenever I'm physically alone, it's not an acute sensation because I'm always doing something else, something comforting or at least analytical (like sitting on the Yolobus to Davis, watching the black guy use my cell phone). And when I'm with people, I start to feel empty. Maybe that's the joy of instant messaging. You can shut people off whenever you want. You don't have to be there physically to see facial expressions, to read body language. And everything's malleable, and written out. Planned, if you want it to be. Spontaneous if you're in a chatty mood.  So after little thought and even less experience, it probably wasn't the best night for a study session. That's another thing: it's hard to isolate what exactly it is that I want when everything else is also going on inside my head.  But maybe I'm also elevating this thinking, this confusion, to a higher level--somewhere it's not supposed to be. It could be very possible that everyone else just goes through the same experiences, the same thought processes, and it just happens that I dwell too much on them. So where is all this introspective going to take me? No doubt, it's just copious observations. I've never thought much about harnessing all this strange energy, and I can rarely write well on command.  Watching people coming and going. Wondering, and knowing that some things are just not for me. Funny enough, you just learn to let that go. And it's not even like it requires some intense meditation or resignation or self-deprecation, either. I almost like it. It's that fly-on-the-wall feeling, and even better since you know more context than if you were stuffed in a random room with random people. I like hearing people just talk and not knowing that I'm there.  Hm, all the locks got cut off at school. And one of the first things I think of after Nige tells me is ah, that'd make a good story for the paper. I am warped.  Send in the clowns.

      In between SATII practice tests...  Piano is still hanging like a cloud over me. Just being in the presence of so many talented people and listening to them play seamlessly and confidently makes me question where I am really going with this all. And I just wish I could shrug it all off and go outside and take a walk and come back whole again.  The Internet is public domain. Should this be reason to regret that I'm keeping this blog? It's selective exhibitionism, yes. Selective. Maybe some of you would be better off forgetting that this ever exists? It's that whole issue of the things you want to tell and how true those things will be when they come out for an audience. Some things are better off under the surface.  There is some inexplicable pall over me that'll probably disappear with Monday morning, but until then, I'm left to wonder some screwy things. How do I get myself out of this? Hard work, probably. This reclining and typing and thinking probably isn't doing so much for me.  But I am surrounded by saints. St. Steve (or Shredder), thanks for comic relief--that phone call, lol. And then there's Charles and Peter and Andrew, in no particular order...I should probably just give a weak "I'm ok" smile and move on.  My hands smell like mayonnaise and something else. Cream sauce? lovely.

      Remind me: I love yellow legal pads. And good black pen. Oh man, there was nothing better than that black pen and that good ivory paper.  Flipping through channels during lunch, I discover an interesting one on the History Channel (read: dork) about stigmata. Is it Easter already? Psychosomatic injuries: I wonder how many times a person has to convince themselves that they're hurting. A million? How big is a million, anyways? And I remember first grade, when we all had to bring a hundred of something. I brought 100 Q-tips. And it was this amazing possessive streak I went through, but I just couldn't bear the idea of those 100 Q-tips staying at school overnight, so I took them home. Everything used to have some great intrinsic value for me. Everything still does, but to a lesser degree. I can't throw anything away that I got during a happy time: dance ticket, UC Davis paraphernalia, something from Paris. Or something that came from someone dear: I still can't get over losing anything Grandma gives me.   SO what is a million? Have I played a million keys in piano? Walked a million steps? Typed a million letters? Written a million letters? To get the wounds of Christ, how much should someone think they are hurting? A million times, would they have to go over piercings on the hands and feet and sides? What is the power of the human mind?  For some reason, I feel sorry for Sra. Bruckner today. Someone didn't really fill out the "Nosotros, no" side and supposedly had to see her English teacher about the essay so she had to come back later. Senora just says, well, you can't do that, detecting sliminess. And after seeing B get upset, the girl finally assents and finishes. B mutters to me: "Ay! I'm so glad I'm retiring soon."  So period 2 hasn't been treating her too well...I remember verbal complaints: "Why are we doing this again?" and just complete retaliation and random C noises and speaking English in Spanish class. I wonder how hard it must be to put on a happy "Ay, chicos!" face during class and tell us about semana santa and travels in a happy tone and just show a completely different side during lunch. How terrible it must be to be judged by your peers and also by a gaggle of disrespectful children in AP who always detect teacher weaknesses and worm through. We are a passionate lot. And when it comes time, we hate fiercely.  So we come back to human strength. I wonder, how strong must you be to pretend you have the stigmata and live life as a living saint while everything about you is false? You can't confide in anyone. And since most of the people with stigmatas were women, that's even more difficult: I take the chauvinistic view, ironically, that women are weaker. I am living proof. I need to tell someone, something, what's going on in my head. Anything I do wrong I usually reveal somewhere safe. How do you withstand the scorn of 40 unruly AP students who have this air invincible superiority? How do you stay a fraud?   "I was waiting for a crosstown train in the London underground."

      Just woke up from a nap. Still in PJ's, got that residual icky feeling in the mouth and the residual crap in the eyes. Glasses. And listening to Postal Service again. I can't get sick of it yet.  Am thinking that I've just let myself do many random, frivolous things and I'd better crack down on this uncontrollable activity before it starts influencing more serious exploits, namely piano. I know it won't directly affect it--well, yes it will, in terms of practice time and mindset. I just know that what I do generally is probably going to seep into piano activities. I'd really like to do well in Bach. And once that's done, it's AP's and then a license, which shouldn't be all too bad.  Recycling bins are coming out to cost more than it should: Recy-CAL is $3593.91, J.

      Today just made everything yesterday seem absolutely profane.  Master class. I get there in the morning, the sanctuary is dark and only S is playing away at the piano. Then people come. Apparently, there's this new teacher in our area (could it be the one from USC W was talking about?) who studied with Bricard. Korean. Talented at piano, apparently. I have much respect for her.  It's great. These people have played so much that they just call it "Le Tombeau." Ok, so we'll have the Toccata from Le Tombeau first. I go play. It's not the best I've ever done, and even according to my standards it's not magnificent. But there are so many things I must fix, according to Ms. Bricard. She's a pedagogue six years into her retirement. Smallish lady, short brown hair, middle-class grandma type. For one, I need much more staccato technique, which calls for a spastic hand movement I can't match. It was pretty humbling: the new teacher had warned us beforehand that she could get a little excited and yell, and I found that to be true. I got a good loud NOOOOOOO! which echoed sharply in the sanctuary. Fingering concerns. Note accuracy, which is even worse. The footnotes comment. See, I knew I would just set myself up for this.  I guess it would have been all ok if it'd only been me, but S and N also played. Well. So I tried to be penitent, sitting still. But redemption in such circumstances is more difficult than that.  So now I am afraid to touch the Ravel. It, for one, will require a long session at the piano. And I've somehow screwed up my right wrist so that it hurts when I rotate it. I have no idea how that works. Plus, I have another master class at Colburn Saturday then the Bach Festival April 3. I just finished practicing a little Bach. Learning from today, I'm redoing all the funny fingerings in the fugue since I, as usual, was a sloppy student and made up my own fingerings which result in floppy hands and same-finger jumps. I hope it works. Remember what happened at Bach last year? I can't afford to put myself through that again.  Piano outlook: busy. I will have performed...five times this month. Hopefully, three more in the next month if I do well at Bach, but then I don't mind. I got lucky: Dr. Lepley from Colburn called today to see what I'd play Saturday, and I was playing piano. I was the last time she called too. Am I making up for last year's Panel flop? Maybe. But I'm going first Saturday. First last Sunday, first today, first in two days.   There must be something wrong in the wiring of my system. I remember I never had the nervousness problem as a little kid. As I got into elementary school, it developed more and more. And then last year it got better with the concerto performances. Now it's still a variable. Why am I scared of playing for an audience when I have no problems with public speaking?  Some pondering on piano to do.

      No more secret mission. Though I don't know what to do with the prize now. Oh the things we do.  Peanut sauce. Yes, peanut sauce, mmmm.  I'm just kind of tired right now and numb and smiling. I wish I could play more piano, I hope it's enough (is it ever? no) so I'll probably play more later on, but c'est la vie. It's always like this though. It always goes better when I'm warmed up, which doesn't leave much to work with when I'm not and just about ready to play, really.  Looking at the lyrics: I've never missed anyone to death. Or I deny it fiercely. I don't know, I don't think I'll ever forgive myself for doing anything that stupid. What was your profile, K? "fucking retarded?"  Comfortable, almost satisfied.

      A tongue-in-cheek observation: after two hours of straight piano, I have a right to muse. Happily, my fingers are still warmed up from playing and I can type somewhat better. Too bad my shoulder cramped and my middle finger feels funny after trying to make all those 4 eighth note groups even. Strokes.  I was more intolerant before, but Postal Service is playing. I can't help it, every time I listen I can't help but smile, especially for the first three tracks. Postal Service is the feeling of falling of love. Of crying because you're so happy for no apparent reason. Of peace, of careful but nostalgic retrospective.  So here's the plan.   I have no plan. I just realized that, too. I don't know, just lay low, I guess. I keep convincing myself that independence is the solution to all my problems: I wouldn't have to sit around thinking what I should do during lunch because I could just drive to the clubhouse and have a sandwich and curly fries. Well, that's the thing that bugs me most right now--because I'm busy the rest of the time. Lunch is such an annoying window of time: antisocial Lydia does not wish to venture to the rosy place nor does she wish to ensconce herself in the indefinite depths of the library. So now what?  Driving to pick up Austin from school today, Mom and I found that a section of Hillcrest had been blocked off. There were police at the intersection and ambulances whining. Later, P told me that someone had died in the ER that day, and we both think it was that accident. Apparently, it was an elderly couple driving. The wife died, but the husband survived. P noted the crowd of relatives waiting in emergency today.  Imagine resting in pain in your hospital bed inside one of those glass pens in the ICU. You have tubes taped and stuck all over you, you are numbed by pain. And you know that your wife is dead. How do you heal?  In retrospect, I regret laughing so hard in the stairwell. Someone told me to keep it down. Somehow I reassure myself it's ok because people come to life, too, inside that hospital. But is it? Death is an inevitability, but it's ever more poignant when it's a car accident.  I dislike M very much now. Disneyland somehow mailed journalism three free passes to the opening of the Tower of Terror at California Adventure: one for the adviser, two for students. Brandon was a shoe-in. M totally volunteers herself: "I'M GOING TOO!" And that wasn't the only time she said it either. When Mrs. B brought it up again, she was quick to remind her that SHE was going. Maybe C was going to go too. Nobody dared to be so verbal or to announced that THEY were the one worthy journalistically of half a day at Disneyland for a new ride, with free food. I'm sorry, but how inconsiderate is that? I'm sure nobody can say that she's the hardest worker on the paper staff, or that she has any other special merits that qualify her for that one ticket up for grabs. She's usually busy with something else during deadline. Granted, it's probably some other official business, but if she can't be at B's working on the paper, what use is she to the Arrow? And how does she justify that SHE deserves that last ticket? What angers me is that 1. she dares assume that she is the one who is worthy. It's not even a question of "Can I go too?" It's blatant "I'M GOING!" and 2. nobody else is fighting over it. Nobody has the audacity, the rudeness, to volunteer themselves for the prize unjustified. So maybe she's book smart, but that's terrible character. If anything, that last ticket should go to P, or even K. At least T has  the people skills. I'm just disgusted she thinks she's earned it.  So I dismount the soapbox.  Disclaimer: I hope you guys know this already, but if you take everything word for word seriously in here you're in for a lot of 1. overanalysis and 2. uneccessary bother. This is probably stream-of-consciousness writing, done in the heat of passion--or lack thereof. I won't account for the complete veracity of all of this. And I'm not going to stifle my thoughts or my personality just to make any audience member happy. In short, don't take this as Clif's Notes on Lydia without checking, or you're setting yourself up for choppy logic.  Unfortunately, I've reached a trough. It's all mental.

      Last week I had the strangest dream where everything was exactly how it seemed where there was never any mystery of who shot John F. Kennedy. It was just a man with something to prove, slightly bored and severely confused. He steadied his rifle with his target in the center and became famous on that day in November.   Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in (x4)   Again last night I had that strange dream where everything was exactly how it seemed concerns about the world getting warmer people thought that they were just being rewarded  for treating others as they'd like to be treated for obeying stop signs and curing diseases for mailing letters with the address of the sender. Now we can swim any day in November.   Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in (Now we can swim any day in November)   Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in (x2)   Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping oooh, oooh (repeat until fade)

      Mildly frustrated.  Beneath it all, everything's ok. But there are just minor annoyances.  I have a piano master class Thursday that I'd better prepare for: it's the Ravel and hence the possibility for crazy mixed up notes, tangled fingers, etc. And it's Nancy Bricard. Sigh. I hope practice for the rest of the week won't mimic what happened this afternoon: after a shower, I decided I was tired. And slept until the piano lesson, no time to warm up. Sleep is good. Even when your hair is wet and you know you have to wake up in half an hour.  That was deep.  But I'm better now, albeit tired. Tutoring lasted longer than I expected, and I think both teacher and student were tired by session's end. Yawn.  And sometimes you just start talking to people and everything they say is a rebuff despite your crystal clear good intentions. It just has to keep you on your toes, I suppose. And some people are just positively down, and I have no way to help it. Some people are way too happy for their own good and you just can't match their bubbliness. Some people will use you and they will only demand.  I have yet to meet a pensive type like me who rarely talks. That's a good thing, though...it means that I'll have some sort of conversation wherever I go, and as the quiet one I can regulate it. It's just a matter of keeping up, of changing pace, of dealing.  Sadly, I think I need to start assigning numbers to every person I overanalyze so I can just keep track and remind myself how crazy this all is. It's all mental, though, which is what kills me: there will be nothing palpable I can stare at and investigate. Even that is scary. Even worse is that now I toss around something that doesn't even exist, and I make a game out of it.  So now I really wonder what I do in my free time. Either I spend it on the computer making worthless conversation that probably fuels my wild imagination, or I fall asleep. Or I do homework, or eat...speaking of which, I should start watching what I'm eating. And then there's that perennial if: IF I COULD DRIVE/had a car, I'd pop in the Postal Service and...go to Barnes and Noble. Yes, that's a safe choice.  And Mom starts doubting my college abilities. Maybe I thought I was too invincible in the past, but she's starting to get on my case again about APs and that 6-year med program at USC and blah blah blah. The only gem from that conversation: I love the Cheungs. I'd pay good money to have a family like that.  Sometimes I think I'm missing so many things.  Listen to the Postal Service.

      Haha. I hate quizzes, but I also hate how true this one is.  Deliberate Brutal Love Dreamer (DBLDf)  Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic. Excuse me. The Priss.   Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgments. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy.   These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards.   You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing.

      I am pooped.  And in a quiet mood. After leaving the after party, I decided I'd screw going home for a minute or two and just drove. First made a detour onto the street with the "Sunnyhill" sign and ended up on Cresthaven. Drove down Westlake and followed the road until I decided it was stupid to go on. All the while, the fog was literally rolling in against the car and I could see it in waves. I even missed a stop sign at Kanan and I hoped to God a police car wasn't nearby. A funny mission, no less. I take these things too seriously, and it's probably better that I stop fueling my crazy reveries. Remember how all I wanted to do spring of freshman year was to round the back of the poolhouse...  Backing out of the parking lot, I feared I'd run something over. M said something about a knee. And the car wasn't going right. I was scared. And then I realized the rigidity wasn't a knee but the parking brake.  Worked the concession stand tonight at the game with Mr. and Mrs. M. My first taste of real, real suburbia. Or PTSA family, etc. I despise those ideals. I return at 5:45 from Wendy's, get N's message that J's not going to be in to toss salads until 6:15 because "dude, you don't need an hour to do a salad." Waiting for J, Mrs. M and Mrs. D take over. I try to make myself somewhat useful, but all I get around to doing is making like I don't know anything. They commandeer the booth and change the prices, at which I took offense. They were right in the end, though, so no hard feelings. I didn't like their stereotypical-ness at the beginning, but in the end, I'm a believer? (that QUESTION MARK was just for you, S). They talk about "OH! I met you at the gym!" Mrs. M sways and moves her feet in time to R&B. They ask me where I want to go to college. "Harvard," I reply with my USD shirt on. "OH! like RM!" Softball girl.  But they are good people. Mr. M talked about college, mostly, when conversation didn't have to deal with "How much are the nachos?" Guarded the pizza from the Mob Squad, still showing off their garrulous championship rings. Kept the $20s in his back pocket. Meanwhile, J--concession booth chair--is sitting at the scorer table with N. But I did say that I didn't want to watch the game. Nacho cheese sauce, by the way, smells like something from a physio dissection lab.  Sometimes, I just wish I had parents like that. Parents who I wouldn't be ashamed to show off (would I send mom's anatomy letter to Mrs. B? not on my life). Parents who would want to get involved. PTA mommies. I was such a total misfit, and it was curious. Hi J, hi N, hi C, R, how's your grandma? And who are you? A virtual nobody. I like it though. But it also means having to prove yourself all over to someone new, having to keep a straight face and do whatever they say. Subservience works.  And maybe, underneath it all, T is right about C. "Did you want a ride home?" I hate it, though. I can't sustain such an annoying propensity for subscribing, shall we say, so easily. And it's embarrassing how quickly I can move, though thankfully it's mostly mental work and doesn't escape past my mind.  It's funny how this blog becomes allegorical once in a while.  And sometimes I wish that they would say that it was all ok, that they didn't mean it and they'd want to do something to make it up. There'd be more laughter to follow, more inexplicable, lovely things. Something to make me want to wake up every morning smiling and staying happy until I went to bed at night. But I don't know, is this really what I want? Or am I stronger the way I am now, reminded constantly that this is the way it's supposed to be? Did they really mean what they said? Or was it something else?  There are so many people so dear to me. Too many people. And it isn't right to starve for them.   Eat up on the independence, Lydia.

      Uneventful Saturday morning. I've never felt so useless lately as I did an hour ago.  In true antisocial wimp fashion, I fell asleep early last night. Again. Went to bed at 7:30 and slept straight until 9 this morning. It seems like I missed out on something. Oh well, I dreamt of Grandma's 80th birthday party and the pool and a really big building and flushing golden goldfish down a sink.  And now I'm just sitting here.  I have the honors recital tomorrow afternoon, and for some strange reason, I have to play the Szumanowski. I did not play it well during panel. Hm, wonder how that works now. It's just really slow, which makes me want to give up on it after thirty minutes, never enough. And the Ravel needs fixing before Thursday. Ick, I'm scared. The lecturer is the lady that edited my Ravel book. I guess I have the advantage of being able to read her footnotes, but the question is--will I? I tend to make stupid mistakes like that.  Completely apathetic right now. I have to be at school by 2 to help set up for Hollywood Knights, and frankly, I don't care much for it. I guess it's just to help T out, but if it means staying up until midnight for something I'm not all too passionate about. And to see J get so riled up about it and to hear the other side from T...not too pleasant.  Yaay, I get to drive Grandma's car to school at 2. Alone, haha. I'm bringing a CD. The possibilities unfold...  Maybe I'm too excited about Harvard. I woke up this morning thinking about it and I just couldn't go back to sleep. In a little more than three months I'll find myself in lovely Cambridge, and that just kills me. Almost. I looked up yesterday all the houses of Harvard on their website, and it's just so funny. One house has a "Drag Night."  February is better, and you know it!

      Somewhere in between.  One of these days, I'll just have to step back and laugh at myself. When I'm older, I'll write an unabashedly pathetic autobiography and enjoy all the unecessary drama through which I've put myself. It will be a riot, I promise.  Two keys to happiness: hard work coupled with hedonism. I have never realized how true that is. I think I indulged too much in the latter today, though: two hours of thorough vegetation on the couch eating leftover sushi, taking a nap. Realizing at 8pm that I still have an anatomy letter to write, realizing at 10:15pm that I still have math homework to complete. Surprisingly, I remain unfazed. This is probably bad. The Szyumanowski needs revamping before Sunday.  Going to Taco Bell for lunch with J and A completely made my day. My week, maybe. Sunshine after the rain, the imaginary rain now. It's so nice to do something normal again, for a change, though I don't advocate severe assimilation. Men of the moment. Friends. Life. It's funny--after lunch today, I could probably tackle anything for the next day or two. Fuel for the laggard soul.  Failed another English quiz. Ha. SAT II Literature? You bet.  I hate people who talk to you only because they need help. Like H. I'm taking a nap, and she calls: who's signing your form for Excelsior? Just get your parents to do it and write a note for Mrs. Freeman. Bye. Then just now: how many hours are you putting on your form? R's putting 15. I don't care. Well, I just want to put the same as you. I don't care, just do whatever. Well, we practiced for two hours a few times, and then we went to Hillcrest and Los Robles...I DON'T CARE. That, and S asking me about Spanish homework. Every time. I love you predictable people.  Today's the only day John Mayer's "St. Patrick's Day" works.   In A's words, I'm out.

      There are just little things that have to cheer you up.  I was looking for WHS letterhead when I decided to go through my old hatbox of letters and little notes that I decided to keep. Found notes from over the summer: a letter from T and J and Q on their way to an ASG retreat, half an email from N when I was still so blind, about the one thing he wanted so badly, little off-color jokes. And a Christmas card from A years and years ago. Sometimes I wonder how he is. He probably has the jerk in him still, but maybe he's softened up? "Enclosed is the program..." One of these days, I'll wonder if I was the ultimate jerk. But it was sixth grade. I don't think I really did anything right back then.  After thorough self-analysis, I've been a party pooper lately. I don't know, what's the best side of me? It's certainly not coming out. Ideally, I'd talk, for one. Even that is an obstacle--what should I tell you about myself? Do I have anything grand to confess? Well, I saw Butch from radiology three times today at the hospital, but one person would find that funny. And P hid "Powerade" in his pants as he was heading out. Thank god for elastic (?) I've never noticed so much that I want to be alone. And it's not even technically alone; it's thinking so hard that you don't notice that you're the only one there, like when you're driving and you're concentrating on the lines on the road.  S's birthday in two days--and I thought I saw him (as crazy as it was) heading into the side door of the emergency room today. He had the tousled brown hair, the tan, the faded polo, the cargo shorts and the flip flops. AH. I could have sworn that if he turned around with the sunglasses and the grin (enhanced by Carmex) I would have believed it all.  Aaaah, NHS form signatures.  I'm not intrinsically mean, but I just don't know what to do now. At the time, I could have honestly spouted off a lot of things, but now? It was an awfully reasonable letter. But that's also preying on the fact that I forget too easily. And is it just because of the quartet issue? She called me arrogant and stuck-up and a whole bunch of other things in between. She thought it was funny to gang up on me and just make fun of me. She did things for "reaction," for emotional hurt. And now?  And I've changed a lot since then, too. This was probably the one issue that messed up two connections. T perhaps might be ok again, but R? I'm glad I realized back then that I was an idiot, and even happier that I can make it along just fine, thank you, without him. I don't know. There was a time when I just felt like I was hanging there because I'd just given up on these things ("you break up with people by cutting them off...") but now I'm so ok with it. And even value-wise. Moral development?  If I could, I would hop in the car now, pop in a CD and drive alone until the gas ran out. I lack some sort of strange peace.

      Ack, I don't need commentary right now. Go away.  In the most basic of senses, I am a loser.  And I've never dealt with it--maybe it's time to find a way out, and now? It's funny, it seems like I've lost all my momentum. There's nothing to make me really care right now--not dinner, not homework, not piano, not friends.  In short, I am down. And I just need to fish myself out of this rut. Alone, please.  Dreams are potent things, but they can also be pernicious. I might have just dreamed all of the possibilities away and now I'm just left here, a human vessel sitting at the computer (think: maquina). I have a habit of doing that too much. So I've really trampled one situation, and I'm beginning to eat into another. Another one that exists only because I think it does. How incredibly stupid of me.  Maybe I am just too ambitious. I see the big picture, whatever's at the end of the tunnel, but along the way I run so fast I trip. And fall.  Naturally, I'm already quiet. Too quiet. Factor this in, and I'm practically mute.   Remember that old song by Lifehouse? Spin? I need that now.

      All of a sudden, Lydia has a lot of homework to do. And no good music to do hw with--Coldplay + DMB has been overdone these past few days, with funny glitches. WHERE IS JIMMY EAT WORLD? Cheating gets it faster. Hah.  Fortune from last night: "Honor yourself, and others will honor you too." How ironic.  narcolepsy. necropsy. necrophilia.  secret missions. sexuality. sacrifice. shaving cream.  life, unfortunately, is back to normal again.

      Ten minutes to blog before I have to tutor. What a life, but I love it anyways.  SAT IIC math class. Four guys, two girls, Mr. J. Went over the 50-question packet, got four wrong, but what the hell. Am envious that I can't do the Asian pencil twirl. I think one guys hair looks like a tamed version of R's, or A's. And he got a 1560 on the SAT...so what's the use?  What's the use? I don't know if I even need it, but I must appease the parents if I want to have eight weeks of peace over the summer, so might as well. It's $20 a session. I don't think it's worth it, but mom and dad won't stop harrassing me about it, so if it makes them happy, then go for it.  Must...practice...piano. And I'm going to get the evaluation back tomorrow, ew. Bach and Ravel.

      Saturday afternoon: after driving Grandma to the hairdresser's, going to the drugstore, eating a box lunch and hanging out the laundry, I have time to think.  I am conducting an open-minded analysis of some of the icky things in me. I've already analyzed one point, now another: materialism. I can see myself as a program window: REFORMATTING, with the little bar that inches along. I think I'm at 20% right now. And it's not amazing progress, but it's coming along.  Hm, this post is probably most meant for S and E and K.  I was talking to S yesterday and somehow conversation wanders over to the topic of shopping. (sidebar: I hope you're happy, I'm cringing at the recollection already :)) Needless to say, it wasn't too normal. Word gets around to E, who also reminds me that it's a scary habit. And while betting how long S can stay vegetarian, I'm reluctant to put money forward. E detects it. "Saving money for shopping?" or something of that sort.  Suddenly I am propelled universes back. I see derision.  I know materialism isn't a good thing. But why am I so ready to indulge in it? And is it so terribly wrong? Even if you've earned the means to satisfy that materialism? I know S and E are different people. And I know sometimes they'll hand down advice that I don't really want to follow even if there's logic in it. I'd do what my parents told me to do to an extent, even if I wasn't all for it, but with friends it's different.  Sometimes I'll argue that I'm the independent, unyielding character. And sometimes it's probably wiser to neutralize things a bit for the sake of having company still around when you're all done. So what do I do now? I can see, yes, that it's not a positive thing to invest in outside perception and personal reaction to outside perception (read: clothing). But what if it satisfies me? what if I've earned the money? what if, after all is said and done, I still have money in the bank?  So the weather's warming up, I have the payment from the trio and Chinese New Year money and probably some left over from tutoring, and I want to go shopping.  Hm. Outside forces tell me hedonism isn't too wise right now, but other instincts are telling me otherwise.  What is my aim, anyways? I'd like to go to a good college to show that all my hard work has paid off, I'd like to go to medical school and ultimately be a doctor, doing the work that involves people and making them happy, and something systematic besides. I'm thinking of working in a big-city hospital (Boston?) as a surgeon. And on the side, I'd like to enjoy my first love: the written language.  At the same time, I'd like to be known as someone who's dedicated, who's honest, who's trustworthy, who's interesting--someone who has depth. Someone people can respect.  I'm not trying to be pedantic or high-strung like that, but straightening things out helps me think better, I suppose.  An honest analysis, please don't get me wrong. I just need to think.  I went through the only journal I really have left today. And it wasn't good material either. I can see how I was trying to make it sound a little more insightful, but I realized it didn't work. Maybe it was the subject material, hah. I was still in that phase. Blogging is beginning to look better.

      from E's comment a long time ago:  I want you to know  one thing.   You know how this is:  if I look  at the crystal moon, at the red branch  of the slow autumn at my window,  if I touch  near the fire  the impalpable ash  or the wrinkled body of the log,  everything carries me to you,  as if everything that exists,  aromas, light, metals,  were little boats  that sail  toward those isles of yours that wait for me.   Well, now,  if little by little you stop loving me  I shall stop loving you little by little.   If suddenly  you forget me  do not look for me,  for I shall already have forgotten you.   If you think it long and mad,  the wind of banners  that passes through my life,  and you decide  to leave me at the shore  of the heart where I have roots,  remember  that on that day,  at that hour,  I shall lift my arms  and my roots will set off  to seek another land.   But  if each day,  each hour,  you feel that you are destined for me  with implacable sweetness,  if each day a flower  climbs up to your lips to seek me,  ah my love, ah my own,  in me all that fire is repeated,  in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,  my love feeds on your love, beloved,  and as long as you live it will be in your arms  without leaving mine.   Too sappy, I say, but nonetheless it's beautiful, isn't it?

      AH, THE PURPLE DRESS. I'm cleaning out the closet and putting everything back in its place because during the week, everything seems to accumulate on that good ol' green chair. So the shirts go back on the hangers, Mom's stuff goes back to her place, dirty clothes go in the hamper...and the cover goes back on that purple dress.  I tried it on today. For old times' sake. And I can't help but admire the sequins, the flowers, and all the memories that come along with it. And I just have to come to the conclusion that it was just too good for that event. Purple dress brings back memories of that night on the field and in the truck, but also awkwardness and funny walks and the baseball bleachers and sprinklers.  I won't call it sacrifice, but that was a lot to put in to one dress, to two nights. And I hope I've grown up enough not to repeat the feat again.  Can growth be categorized in dresses?

      I suppose you could say I'm in that middle territory where I can't decide between old ways and new. The central issue here is trust: how much am I willing to trust people?   MUSINGS: Without a doubt, there are some things I wouldn't trust anyone with. And then there are people I would trust with just about anything, and then people who I trust less. I grin when I say I'd like to think I have friends. But do I censor myself too much? Is it terrible to categorize friends? S and E are of the idea that it is, and they do have a point. But then again, they're different people. C doesn't think it really matters. I don't know, I was always of the idea that people appreciated listeners too, but now they're looking for talkers?  For some reason, my mind has the idea that I need to put things in print in order for them to have more structure, more filling to them, but then again I must be careful. The upside to blogging is that it's faster and neater (better than journals written while propped up on pillows), but then again, it's for an audience. But the downside is that exposure has gotten out of hand. I don't mind people reading it who don't live in the area, and I don't mind telling people who I would probably tell all to anyways, but once the audience grows you start keeping things out.  So yes. Maybe I should start keeping journals again?  I don't know whether or not to tell people about Harvard over the summer. Frankly, I'm excited as ever but it just implies ivy league and snobbiness and moneyed people and snotty intellectual superiority. I just don't want to say it and have TC types think that's just stuck-up and rude, which it isn't, in my humble opinion.  I actually don't have that much homework. So I'm going to look up plane tickets. Hah.  In the end, it's all about perspective. I talk to some people and they can make me feel completely guilty and have me pledge reform and give up my pride (unyielding, as always, and I don't see how that's a bad thing, but I have a thick skull), and then I talk to others who are just ambivalent and tell me hey, you're fine! and there are some others where it's just like, ugh, I can't stand it, you should realize that there's this and this and this wrong with that. I know ultimately I choose for myself. It's no burden, but it entails careful contemplation.  How do I fight for independence and find out that everything leads back to relationships with people?  T pointed this out for me today--I'm glad Dad's the person he is. He'll be the one to take me driving when both Mom and Grandma think I'll do something dangerous, he'll be the one to take me to get that scarf and that dress, and he'll nudge me in the direction of growing up despite being fundamentally Asian about other things too. And he's letting me go and says his old (and I say this in the best of ways) Jewish consultant can pick me up at the airport in Boston. I smile when I think about this: this man lives in the Boston 'burbs, is married but has no children, talks about education (he apparently did well in school) and said something about taking people to New Brunswick, where the people are backward. HOW COOL IS THAT? and best of all, he's coming to California in a matter of weeks. (Dad says he's afraid to show him our house because his consultant's is impeccably clean, while ours is...lived in, let's say.)  And happy I'm here. I'm happy I can look forward to the end of June (eight weeks! yeah!) and I'm happy I can have fun planning it. I'm happy I actually got through the Bach double today, I'm happy I showered right after school and it felt awfully good. Yes, I have things to ponder over. I still have to look up cultural leads, and I don't want to do it (pre-start fears?) but I should sooner or later because by tomorrow it will have been a week. I want to go shopping, lol.  So here, Z, is a song in your honor: "It's a beautiful day..."

      Emo blogging. That's really all I have to say.  [ciertas cosas oscuras] have put me in check, and it's ironic: washing my hands after a productive day at school I realized wow, maybe I've weathered this well, I don't have to deal with them anymore and life is still comfortable, stable--and now?  So I don't know how to put it now. I'm sure few people on this planet have the time or the patience to untangle such things, yet there shouldn't be so many strands to untangle in the first place. I would love to assume that I am the levelheaded one but I can't--what is insanity? Isn't it funny how the nature of insanity is such that those who are insane don't realize it? Could I be insane and oblivious simultaneously?  Well guess what, I'm not going to censor myself since I didn't mean for this to be some large-scale deal, only private meditations for the right people. And it's not like that now. I'm in no mood to delegate blame, but just as certain select souls (just me) were allowed to view that dear little journal, such is the nature of this. And just as I violated the sanctity of that journal, I've done it again, though this time I will say--no es culpa mia. (What's mea culpa? that's been distracting me these days)  SO HERE'S HOW IT GOES. I have no freaking idea why this is such a big deal, so here I sit, perplexed. It was a tiff over one thing I would much rather keep to myself. Please tell me I'm not crazy to want to tell someone something that would ultimately hurt myself--in more exaggerated terms, I'm sure you would think me insane (and here it pops up again) for sticking a knife through my chest just for the sake of doing it because it'll make someone else feel better. Three people know what I do not wish to ever hear again: one, because it was inevitable: the situation entails knowledge, another, because he lives in Seattle, the last, because such things slip from tongues, and his/her nature is such that a. it doesn't matter the slightest farthing to the party with the intelligence so b. it will not escape.  Do not tell me I am the only mortal with secrets. And what is a secret stripped of secrecy? It is gossip, it is scandal, it is whispering, a seed for wild speculation. Naturally, secrets remain secret to avoid other less pleasant fates.  Thought Police. The last private space is the mind, and I will not betray its inner chambers without a fight, especially when technology has yet to find a way to pry this last bit of personal property from its hiding place.  Understand this: calm down, first of all. You have no business knowing what I know, especially because it hurts me and, by programmed human instinct, I will not deliberately hurt myself. You will not be a better human knowing it, and you will not be any worse not knowing it.   So what do you do now? There is a void, but a reasonable one. There are many other voids, there is little truth to be found in every aspect of our lives. What's important is your interpretation. You can make a big deal out of this empty air and have it bother you, or you can just accept this as an inevitability--it's not like you're the only one who is left in the dark--and calmly move on. My truth, as far as I know it, is there. It happens to be twofold: I know what happened, and I choose to keep it to myself for as long as I can. So now it's your turn. What's your truth according to mine?  And don't tell me you don't have secrets.  Conversations with K yesterday: what is truth? Is life made up of little truths added together that don't make sense? Is truth perceptive? palpable? divine? And what is truth good for anyways? Why do we look for truth in every little thing we do? Why is art art, and why wouldn't it be? Who decides? What's right? What's left? Would it be fair to say that life is based on universal assumptions just to make everything easier? And something about a network of possible truths, branches infinitely stretching out, splitting into two and then four then so many more. A truth tree.  And if we are given the gift of one truth and one truth only, can we assume all else? Is existence truth enough? I don't think so.  Questions. And only comfort measures, no answers. ------------------------------------------ On a sunnier note, the entire day wasn't such an ordeal until I got home. Everything felt like summer again, I was in my flip flops and I could just feel the sun on my arms and the smell of whatever smolders in hot weather and I just thought, wow, this is Davis again.   Talking to A makes me want to talk to my parents and thank them for being less of the demanding, overbearing force I thought they were. I'm growing up, yes, and only because they're letting me. And I realize now that there is so much for me to learn even beyond what they can teach me, and such satisfaction to be found. So Dad's coming home tonight. Maybe I can give him a smile and concede that yes, he was the liberal after all.  Journalism is falling together, thank goodness. My three pages are just about done except for a few minor details, so I have a good part of tomorrow for copy editing. B gets on my nerves ("hug Greenie!") and so does J sometimes ("she curls up in that eMac box...") but I'm just so glad they're around. And Mrs. B, too. J said it was scary how B and I are so close, and I think it's funny too, but in a good way. I am so glad she is there to mentor me, and I hope I give her something of me in return (diligence? moral, intellectual development?). I don't know what I would have done if she wasn't there when I was so incredibly pissed off at Mom that I needed some other adult to talk to, if I felt lost in journalism ("uh...I don't have a front page") and if her Girl Scout cookies and chocolate didn't sustain me through the day. I think I've gone through a good majority of her Lemon Coolers.   To borrow K's phrase: happiness was mine.

      My, oh my, what a wonderful day!   I don't know why I'm feeling so awfully happy, but here's my conjectures: panel's over and Mr. Francis didn't get the eval back yet so consequently he isn't as pissed as he could be, and I've gotten home safe without feeling like crap. I did a new layout on the front page in journalism (haha yes, there's a front page now) and there's at least 50% of the teaser pictures and everything seems to be falling together. And it's getting warm again. Enduring hot weather just reminds me of the Davis Days and walking into Tercero with helmet in hand, sweat running down in rivulets. Just the smell and the feel...and I can almost expect to take out my key (234) and stick it in the door and come into the stairwell. And there was good food for dinner: tofu, chicken...just the way it's meant to be always.  But yeah. I'm sitting here without burdens, and boy does it feel good. Journalism's actually working out for a change, and I only need to sort out little minor details until I can get everything finished, and hopefully I'll still have time to do a bit of copy editing. haha, I can't stop thinking about how I love the front page design...it's at least different from the usual hi, here's a picture on the right (right? which way's right? from the physio lab), and I just need a good cute picture and a good solid article. Please, I beg. Ruego. Suplico. All I have to do is do hw and shower and little minor stuff, and then I can go to bed a happy girl.  I should hear from none other than Harvard within a week. Fantastic!  Design, design, design. Things are by design.

      Now that I'm properly sated, it's time to write.   I was going to bring up something else, but it jsut hit me how busy this coming week is going to be and how unpleasant Monday is going to be in particular. I still have no front page. I have two stories to finish by tomorrow and it's already 5:35. I'm probably going to stay after until I absolutely have to go to the piano lesson, and even then it won't be reason to rest easy: I'm completely expecting an icky panel evaluation back tomorrow, and I have no motivation to practice. NO MOTIVATION AT ALL  reading the signs, Reading the Signs, READING THE SIGNS. and it doesn't look good. at all.  Much madness is divinest sense.  I hate driving lessons? maybe.

      Nostalgia prevails when you're looking through old yearbooks. It's funny how you'll read some entries (i.e. A's) and think it was totally harmless last summer but now it's a completely different issue. And seeing N's again. Sigh.  Listening to the old Coldplay CD too. What does this tell me?  I'm already mapping out the music I'll have in the car when I get my license. Ah.

      So I just called the girl's mom and told her I wouldn't be tutoring her daughter anymore. Somehow I just feel like I've let her down? Out with one job, in with another. Oh man, that one's going to be a hurdle, too.

      Well, an hour ago I didn't give a damn how I played today, but now after thorough vegetation on the couch, I've come to think otherwise?  I'm getting the feeling that it's one of those bad-dream episodes when you just think you can go back to sleep and everything will be all right again, but will I let it happen? Can it happen? I don't know. Panel was exactly as I'd expected, with deja vu moments from last year: being somewhat late, not practicing, the lady with the jade pendant, a weird piano...and not doing too well. I know I can't pout considering how much I practiced (not much) and now much nerves get in the way (too much). But I just made mistakes I knew I shouldn't have made...as in forgetting key chords and just momentary, random memory lapses. Ack. I didn't like how I played today, and I'm pretty certain Monday I'll get the evaluation back and just not feel too happy about it, but c'est la vie? Moving on, moving on. At least it's over, that's as much as I can say. But now what? I still have that master class and the Ravel to patch up, and either take extreme measures to get the Szyumanowski fixed or change it for Colburn.  I just can't believe that I'll let panic and fear get in the way of good piano playing. And the only way to bypass this crippling effect is to overpractice for it, but who says I have the time? I need to set aside some good piano time, though...I don't think I can afford to cram anymore, and it's also the fear that I'll upset Mr. Francis, too.  I have to email K. Hm.  And sometime this weekend I'm going to have to see a movie. Oh, journalism woes too. I don't think I've ever been three days away from deadline official and not known what's going on the front page, but I guess that's the issue now. What was I doing before? Too much sitting and pondering, perhaps. I still need more pictures...and something big. My attitude towards journalism is changing, though--more going off-campus, which means that on the other hand, I don't spend so much time in at lunch. And I have three days to get my stuff together and go through the other 17. FRONT: nothing! maybe acadeca (old) or MT (embarrassing), a good 2nd story, a visual focus please SECOND: currently I have the library, HK, uh...aca deca too. J has yet to get me MT. THIRD: book buddies actually has a picture that might be good. anatomy story needs more fact and less stuff on the side. oh man, I still have to write that one story. need the ring picture. Should we cover the choir show? that would be an interesting stand-alone graphic. and I thought we were going to do something about calculus, but I haven't seen anything materialize yet, so I'm assuming that either it was never assigned or the person who was supposed to write it didn't do so yet. I like the column. But that's about it for this issue, and it doesn't look good, particularly when I promised myself I'd look at pages earlier to make sure we didn't have any more glaring mistakes, etc.--to make sure I'm doing my job as copy editor, not news editor/procrastinator extraordinaire.  Anticlimax.

      It's a bit past nine and nobody's online worth talking to, so I take it as a sign that I should just go to bed anyways. I am worn out, and I can't attribute it to anything else but sleeplessness and now sickness (as if that weren't reason enough!)  I've always cared about things...no matter how much the delay, and never have I really found reason to flag until now. I am so fatigued that somehow panel doesn't matter that much to me. Or at least, from the point of view of 9pm Friday night it doesn't. I don't know. The Szyumanowski is probably 90% memorized. I've done the Chopin before, so I just need to get it out of the freezer and into the microwave to defrost for a bit. And the rest are fine. Or so I assure myself.  In fact, I am so tired that little mistakes pop up and I don't realize them until way later. I just wonder where all of ME has gone. If I had my way, if I didn't have to be doing panel at 3:15 tomorrow afternoon, I'd be fast asleep. This weekend I'd go see the Barbarian Invasions for journalism, I'd go shopping, I'd be able to drive places. I'd be reading. Actually reading.  Assessing my situation, it's nice that I'm emotionally stable now, but then what? It's not like I have much left. And I don't mean to sound depressing like "aaah, I'm going to die," but I just feel like all my muscles and bones are threatening to collect in a big mush at my feet.  Have a good weekend, you guys! lol, can you say saccharine?

      Nerves are shot, and not for the normal reasons--just from overexcitement either way.  So I'm just sitting here watching the clock and deciding when I should get off my ass and the typical lazy Friday that comes with it to go play the piano. Obligations. I know I'm not going to make it to the state level even if I got mad at Mom for telling me that, but I still want to be able to get through this without doing the little doubtful pauses that just snowball into one big "shit, this is a bad idea" epiphany.  But I want to sleep too. I was up at 1:30 this morning making lemon bars and doing Bailey. Oh, how I hate that phrase. Doing Bailey. Doing Bailey. And now that I'm talking to E and C and S, I just feel like it's crazy to leave...all three of them, and at once?  For some reason, I feel cold (literally) and detached. It's the feeling of itching to write no matter where you are, the feeling of putting on that stoic face. I don't know. There are some good days and you know they're good when your face glows and you're just jumping all over the place, and then there are those other days when you know it's mediocre at best even when you look in the mirror.  I'm tired.

      and then I get back to wondering, how much am I worth? That Joy Luck Club episode always comes back to remind me whenever I reach this point. Am I worth more than I think I am? Less?  So it's finished: cold and calculated, or just concluded. Simply done. When? how? why do we let outside perception get in the way of what's real and true and sharp? But isn't there a song? "What's the use of crying?" I'm not even there yet. What's the use of anything more than carrying on, as usual? Maybe strength is all I need--not just now, but always. It's funny...whenever I say my little agnostic prayers to a forgiving God, it's for a lot of different things but always the strength to handle things no matter what happens. And I write it all over the place, too. Just some sort of cure-all for whatever gets in the way. It's a good umbrella wish.  And somehow, someone is working his magic, and it's working on me.  As of now, I have to do Spanish homework and studying, finish math, and somehow balance tutoring with M and meeting with M--what was his last name again? Shoot, and I have to find the address too.  From the metaphysical to the mundane.  Right now I'm considering going to bed and then waking up way early to finish whatever it is I have to do (except that pesky schedule conflict remains unresolved--why couldn't I just realize how important it was to call to tell them that I couldn't tutor anymore in the first place?) I feel bad that M might have to find out too late and just wait around school until 4 or something, but then again M of the E is an adult and an attorney at that, and I'd feel flakier for missing that appointment if it weren't for the fact that M would probably have to wait. And she paid me for this week, too! (for a change!)  No serious piano today, though. :( what the hell, I instinctively did a happy face.  I am sick of quarter notes and eigthththth notes and metronomic rhythms, but ironically, that stuff is playing in my head now. Simple, classical classical. A Major or E-flat Major. Twangy, happy stuff. soothing.  To bed! March!

      So the volunteer dinner. H is immature, and it bugs me. Giggly, all over the place. Maybe T was right, but I just don't want to judge people according to what other people thik. But it's so true! Playing on that nine-foot Steinway that I missed playing on that one time because I had to do something--mock trial two years ago, I think it was. And afterwards, we snuck into the kitchen and had a dinner--giggles again. I don't know, I'm an old soul and it's probably annoying to other people, but I don't find what's so funny about tiramisu and blueberries.  My brother: "Hem, I can almost do the worm!" I bet he read some online instructional manual, that kid.  Why am I so high on all the good things in life? and why now?

      Super Tuesday. Or whatever the hell that means.  So after less than an hour of plugging away at the piano, I have given up. For the night, never fear. I am just so tired it's bad. lol. And there goes my word sense.  The only other intelligent thing--or things, actually--are tirades against fat people and a meditation on homosexual people. Neither of which you really want to hear.  Argh.  I'm okay, really...I don't mind what's going on around me, it's just that I'm tired and I have a lot on my plate and I just wish I had something to make this all feel better.

      I know I shouldn't be sitting here typing away, but it's therapy.  So what's new? I still haven't gotten over the fact that it's March, but I've forgiven myself already since it's only day two and I can't expect much. Just got back from volunteering at the hospital, and every bit of me is tired. T was there doing her training hours today, though, and she went with me on 'most every errand--we transported a funky flower balloon arch, cooed at the babies in the nursery, did more mundane things. So that was satisfactory. Very much so, actually.  My friendship with T always makes me wonder where I stand on her friend spectrum, if it can be called that. I'm sure she has much more interesting people to talk to and all, and I can hardly be labeled as the type who could associate with her and be on her good side, but apparently I've stuck around for longer than I expected, lol. She's a good person and all, and I think preparing myself for the fact that I can't depend on her for everything is what? a spoonful of sugar when the medicine goes down, or however that goes.  I am slacking off so much in journalism that it makes me Cringe. Yes, with a Capital C. Frankly, I wouldn't mind if I just had a rest break in the middle of the day, but I just don't want to upset Mrs. B, and I'd feel evil if I was using her. So I just finished B's editorial today, and I still have to finish the Dick van Dyke story and start the one on the library. lol. How the hell am I going to do that one?   So B is bi. Thank you.  Why does loss of innocence come in stages? I used to be so detached from wild society and then I found out about parties and druggies and the like. And now I have somewhat gained a little more freedom, only to discover other disturbing facts. Is it unusual that I am always a step behind? What does that say about my development? Outside perception (if it even matters)?  Read more Pablo Neruda.

      Feeling full. Of what? Yes, leftover chocolate cream pie. The starchy pudding stuff has settled nicely. I'll have to try making it myself sometime.  Good intentions have always been just that, but when I look into other perspectives I begin to unravel them all. It's not that I mind that they're falling apart for it's the truth and it's not like things are going to change if I dispute it, but how far does human goodness for the sake of goodness extend? Why do you always feel that little tug when you're doing something without ulterior motives, and why do you always smirk when you're not?  But I overanalyze. Ask anyone, lol. Except they're not around right now because of powerful things under my control.  So this is my March in terms of piano: Mar. 3 volunteer dinner Mar. 6 advanced panel Mar. 25 Bricard master class Mar. something Colburn master class I wonder if I'm good enough. I need to practice.  It's like I still haven't woken up from Sunday yet. This morning I wallked into English only to find out that I'd totally forgotten bagel sales with J for Class of '05. The irony is that I actually woke up at 6 to check what time it was, congratulated myself for being so responsible, and then went back to sleep until 6:40. And I still owe her the pie pan and the gas money, but I bought her lunch today. It just feels like I'm a few beats behind: life is a cacophony.  And I somehow feel bad for what I do in math class--instead of actually doing the homework the night before, I do it in class when she's going over it. Mind you, I don't copy the answers, but I still feel that I'm somehow disrespecting an elder.  Little things like that. The happier I am, the more school life spins out of control. I am more than willing to adjust the equilibrium, but I haven't perfected it yet. It's funny how I am so ready to think that just as one thing improves, another worsens. MT this year was, by far, the best time yet, but at what cost? And this past month--the beginning of it, really--was priceless. Now that we're in March, I felt like I've left so many good times behind--I can see my life as one of those shots from a straight desert highway with dry shrubbery all around and blue sky, and there's the road sign: DEPARTING FEBRUARY. And all that it implies.  Funny visualizations. I've always been the kid to turn to imagination to solve those little problems: fates are little slips of paper drawn out of bowls by some divine power on his cloudy throne, God answers prayers by entering little rooms glowing red in a dark, infinite hallway. And now happiness and obligation are balanced on a scale.  How beautiful would life be if it were a fugue?  Well, after a few days of meditation, I've realized that happiness can't be faked.  Will little satisfactions propel me through a day?

      I thought I wasn't going to blog today to keep my mind on the SATIIs and the piano competition tomorrow, but I was sitting on the bench playing and all I could think of was this madness for running for NHS president.   As we can see by this year's president, that top job isn't necessarily about being the most intelligent or the most capable. It's about popularity. And that troubles me. Barbara's going to run, and I bet a bunch of the choir girls might go for that. Tiff said she'd run against Barbara. And Anna was trying to solicit my vote today. I have a feeling it's going to be just like anatomy: we're all going to want to run. There's going to be ten people out of 42 left in the classroom come voting time, and we're all going to split it every which way, so the winner won't actually be the winner. Maybe you could call it being opinionated. Or prejudiced. Or downright mean. But I predict it's going to be a race of whoever has the most friends, whoever swoons the most over someone else's cute outfit. I know I'm not going to pull off a victory, and at this I laugh: do I really care anymore?  Is it right to hate people like this? Or think that they're not qualified for the job? I don't want to be mean, seriously, I don't. But Barbara only commands those who love her, the rest can't stand her. Anna is a goody-goody, and resentment is audible. Tiff will probably command the vote. Tiff is ok. What is this ambition of mine? Can't I just be happy?  No, I can't.   I guess there's another issue I could be thinking about too, but I choose not to. I left it behind a while ago, and I really don't see a reason to go back except to extract me from ogre status. And I did, but I got a little more out of it than I expected, than I could handle.  I'll write about that later. Now it's back to the piano for some reassurance.

      Fourth entry today.   But maybe this number four for April 29 is a turning point. It's not often that I sit down and think about the way I've been living life and think about how I could improve it. Tonight was one of those rare chances. The NHS induction: I may not be one for ceremony, but hearing about teachers talk about Mark's brother Ganesh and listening to Ganesh talk about himself inspire me to step back for a second and think about my own life. I almost think of it as a cycle. March, I was more withdrawn because of piano. April, I'm starting to lose balance again, having ventured more toward that other side.  At any rate, it's just the right time to reaffirm values. SATs and APs are coming up and I need to have results in mind and study diligently. I haven't been very nice to people--family, but maybe people in general--lately, and maybe I should just think about the way I act. Life right now is too much about what I want, and perhaps that's not the correct attitude now, or ever. I could seriously be less of a Nazi in journalism. I could cooperate in Anatomy. I could stop trying to be such a power-hungry individual and think of the group. Honestly, there's wonderful people out there, and sometimes I fail to see that. I need to be more open, more kind. I'm sure it'd be wise to balance fun in there, but I would like to reshape my character first.  As corny as it may sound, tonight (or as soon as I can) I'd like to resolve some things that have been bugging me.  Is it eventually all for the self? Maybe I haven't made full conversion yet, but it would certainly help me too if I helped others. Thinking to do.

      "Arr" is a popular word in my vocabulary these days, but it's perfect. I'm not angry or anything, just frazzled. I'm trying to stay off AIM, and invisibility's been middle ground but I still feel like half a cheater when I do it. I like to see the movements of people, though.  Tried playing Bach. There's something weird with my fingers. And I just got a jolt of adrenaline, I don't know why. Is it because of Bach on Saturday? NHS tonight?

      post-hot sauce:  Jean's going to Berkeley! I love Jean. Doupe turns around today and asks "Hey, do you know where Jean's going?" So now we know. I'm happy for her.  We got our National Merit letters today. I'm at least commended, but that's not a pleasant thought. I almost think the barb of commended and just commended is worse than not doing it at all. I hope the cutoff is low. 222 for commended? That's preposterous. But then again, I'm biased. The usual brains were there, I guess. Maybe that sounds harsh. I'm in no mood to think of euphemisms. Shoot, where'd I put the letter?  Back to wontons with hot sauce.

      Mm, so it's time to swallow the pride. Did poorly on that English assignment, now I'm number 2. I'll work it up. I just wonder how many points number 1 (Ryan?) has.  Didn't realize how awesome it was to sit next to Doupe again until today. He never pays attention (often, he asks Mrs. Freeman a question right after she lectures on it) and he starts talking to me, too, so I end up not paying attention either. He gawks at my grades.  "Lydia!" he exclaims when I get that B. 72/85. The class average was a 77. We laugh together at my spotty knowledge on sentence structure terms.  Life is very much bearable today. Andrew and Nige are taking pictures of random people and won't tell me what it's about. A photo album, they tell me. Nigel snickers. Andrew, you're going to have to tell me or that's another 20 bucks :)  I'm cheating myself in physio. It's so easy to just memorize everything and not retain anything long-term, but I am busy and I haven't the time to sit down and absorb.   Jess brought up that Barbara was planning to run for NHS president. I tell Tiff. "Ew," she says, declaring that she's going to run too just to stop her. I almost wish I didn't tell her, but that's awfully selfish of me. I want to run too. Tiff is formidable competition. Maybe it really doesn't matter. I just don't want Barbara to win. Barbara-->barbarian-->bearded one. Does she not realize how people hate her? If I like her for anything, it's that she can still let herself live when everybody makes faces at the mention of her name, even when it's people I don't know. Induction tonight. I almost wish I could go to the rest of orchestra so I could see Sylvia and Andrew (falling asleep on cello). Maybe I will. But I have studying to do.   I snapped again. At Grandma this time. I really don't want to go to her birthday party. I'll settle for leftovers, really. It's just not worth it! I will eat, sure, but I don't exactly see the necessity of traveling all the way to San Gabriel. And I know she's turning 80 and that's awfully special, but I have things to do too. It's weird. I'm looking forward, almost, to Sunday and the car wash (just not five hours of it) but I know I'll have to endure the stress of SATIIs and Bach first. I almost thought I didn't have to take the US history SATII today. Wow.  Ok, I'm off. I need some hot sauce on my lunch.

      I'm trying to study for physio. And I'm listening to Death Cab over and over. My favorite lemon soap is almost making me gag. I slept fro two hours today, and dreamed. One disgusting dream, another ok one, but maybe I've learned by now: you don't expose your dreams (or your wishes) for fear of them not coming true.  I had three birthday cakes. I made the same three wishes. Only on the last cake did I remember that I wanted anything else in life. Isn't that weird? But I shan't divulge. At any rate, speaking of cakes, Keira's bday is in 26 days. I'll have to keep a good watch. She's the journalism birthday cake queen and only a good cake would do her justice.  Am thoroughly disgusted at some people who made NHS, and others who didn't. Chaddy didn't, and neither did Charlie or Andrew or Anna Cao or Jordan. Maybe some of the rejected people didn't do that much community service. But it just makes my blood boil to hear that some people put the loveliest crap in there and got in. I'm interested to see who's going to be at the induction tomorrow night. Some people I'm completely ok with, and I know they've done their job. Jess. Tiffany. Nige. Others...I really would like to see their sorry souls burn in hell, to put it lightly. Maybe that's the next column (for the senior issue, yikes!) but I'll have to consult with Mrs. Freeman before I do. It's only fair. I'm sick and tired of people cheating. I'd be ok if they didn't affect my performance, but it's eating away at my relative performance, too. I've already written about cheating before. Would it be more effective in column form? In terms of high school, it's the one thing that infuriates me. My grade is completely mine, but others have the audacity and are so stupid as to have to copy. I wonder how they can look in the mirror at themselves. I hope life grants them an admission to a university that only sends out those terrible flyers because they don't have enough people. I hope they live the rest of their lives in a terrible marriage, in a boring job. I hope one day they'll realize how much they've fucked up their lives, but then it's too late, and then they die.  Satire's the trick, maybe.

      Plans for today: work. Went to school early to scan in a picture of Ganesh Shankar for the NHS induction tomorrow night. There's 42 people in NHS. I haven't told Mom yet, she'll probably get it mixed up and ask me three times before it actually happens.  Homework that I really should do: Spanish Math ooh, study for that physio test.  I guess I'm not quite ready to break down and cry yet, but I have been very irritable lately. I remember talking to Katy's mom on the Davis trip and she said that she'd let Katy do whatever she wanted to do unless she ate, which kept irritability at a low. I love Katy's mom (haha, K, are you reading this?) More understanding than mine, by leaps and bounds. And she's so open about things! My mom, on the other hand, manages to bring out the worst in me. Maybe it's my intolerance, or her tendency to nag or her (and Grandma's) obsession with Grandma's birthday party, but I'm really not dealing with it well lately. But if I must go insane for AP season, I'm ok with this slipping away. It isn't the worst thing. So yeah. I'm grouchy. And stressed. And tired. And have a tendency to eat too much.  Rarrrrrrr.  Thinking about it, this is a very lame blog. Other people can confine their blogs to one set subject, like politics. Others use the traditional method of bolding and hyperlinking. I just ramble on and on and on.  Isn't it bliss? (aren't we a pair? me here at last on the ground, you in the air?) Send in the clowns.

      I emailed Princeton maybe a week ago asking about college tours. Tonight I check my email and someone named Ryan Walsh has sent me something. It's Princeton's Orange Key. He sounds so cheerful: he starts out with a "Hi Lydia!" even though I've kept my own email to a conservative, unassuming level. For some reason, I think, wow. That is so awesome. I want to meet him. But that's very unrealistic. I imagine he's some preppy kid with tousled brown hair.  On a sadder note, I got 21 and 22 wrong, respectively, on my Princeton Review practice tests. That's basically a raw score of 54. Not too pleased, plus, I ran out of practice tests already, so either I go out and grab an REA or I try the library. Maybe. Barnes and Noble closes at 11, so I still have a chance. It's not looking good, though. Lit is annoying, and so is USAP now. What am I to do?

      My math brain isn't working today, let's just say. It's almost humbling when you realize that a freshman knows better than you what 4^2 is. But more for the gas money fund. I just feel slightly retarded.  I have JESU, JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING stuck in my head. I remember the time we played it for the Arts Council meeting and we just stopped for the all-choral parts. A red-faced Mr. Benson turns around and says, "To hear the rest of this, come to our concert!" I love the song, though. I think there's a piano verson that's beautiful, too, but I'm probably too lazy to a. find it and b. learn it.

      Heat.  It turns the corners on the photos, it melts the chocolate (4.5 out of 6 left, Andrew) on the desk. It means crickets and frogs at night, loud. It means waking up at 2am for no other reason but to change into shorts. It reminds me of summers at home. Summers with cold orange juice and endless TV. Summer camp at Willow.  Work, normal work, to do despite the heat.

      I walked into my room last night to get ready for bed, and guess what I see? Mom's sitting at my desk, on the phone. She's just about to hang up, probably just as she hears my steps. I ask who she's on the phone with. It's ED of photography. I've heard her on the phone twice with him now. What the hell is this? They both like opera. That scares me.  Maybe it's simply hypersensitivity that allows me to detect all these little things. Or maybe it's intuition. Whatever it is, I smell a rat. But he has an Asian wife too. I didn't go to lunch on Sunday for obvious reasons, but they came over first. I heard Mandarin being spoken, and I look out on to the entryway. That calmed my suspicions a bit, but there's really no logic to it.  I hate this.   Jess and I saw Doupe today. In conversation, one of his friends stopped by and started hissing Savage Garden while orbiting a very frightened Jess. How can people respect themselves like that? But Jess brought up a relevant point today. Maybe I can trade in Dad's car for a Prius or something less expensive so I don't have to suffer so much paying for gas. I'm looking up the value of Dad's car right after this.  Thought I was going to leave school at 11:30 today, but for some reason they changed it so that we all had to stay on campus for lunch without telling us beforehand. I wish I could drive.  I don't understand why Grandma's birthday party is such a big deal, seriously. They expected me to play violin, but that's the day after three SATIIs and a piano competition, and also the day before my first AP. Then Ed's coming, which is disgusting. And then they keep on asking me what I'm going to wear. I'm not wearing anything fancy, I tell you. Maybe it's a reaction, but I don't see the point of dressing up in sequins. Grandma's just too into it. Sure, she's turning 80, but I don't believe in this age thing anyways: birthdays are simply a milestone, growth is gradual. I've already wrapped all 40-some of her presents for her. I'm actually going when I could probably be enjoying an English study session. Mom doesn't bother to ask about the rest of my weekend first: the primary concern is what I'm wearing Sunday night. I can't believe her audacity. What priorities!

      I'm going to have to pay for gas money.  I'm sure I'm not the only one. But I thought the understanding was that I would stop tutoring if Mom would pay insurance. I guess by a crude calculation, I'd run out of money (and gas) at 19,040 miles, which is a lot. But don't expect me to know the tank capacity of the car or the price of a tank or the MPG. And I really wasn't hoping to spend money accumulated from elementary school hong bao and such on gas, which I only vaguely enjoy, and that's only because it keeps a car running.  Hi, this is terribly spoiled of me.   Mom's a paradox, then. Ok, so she pays for insurance, and I stop tutoring. But if I'm going to generate some money for the gas and I don't want to tap away at savings (I was also planning to use this at Harvard) then I'm going to have to do something about it.   Seriously now, I'm not going to have time to get a job. After AP's, maybe, but that's just about a month before I leave for the east coast. I was planning on working summer after senior year just as a growing-up experience, but that really doesn't help the present situation. It's simply disappointing that they don't get it. I'm not lazy, and I'm not planning in squandering gas, but I really don't have the time to find a means to pay for it. This Saturday, I have SATIIs (which, by the way, Mom confused for the APs--now that's why you should tell her about your life! because she turns around and even messes up the order!) and a piano competition. Sunday's the car wash, Grandma's bday dinner (ick). I'd really rather go to the English review session and go out and have dinner with friends. It's easier, wouldn't you agree? I wouldn't have to dress up (and just stay in shorts all day), I wouldn't have to be badgered into playing violin (I've already declined, but Asian women never stop), I wouldn't have to see the photographer and flash another fake, fake smile, I wouldn't have to see relatives I don't even know about, I wouldn't have to be in San Gabriel until late at night, I wouldn't have to ride in a full car all the way out there...I hate this.   The irony is, after I told Mom that I'd probably have to start tutoring again, she says gaily, "Well, remember to manage your own time well." Thank you, Mother. Either you've finally learned to keep out of my schedule (APs on weekends, etc.) or you're simply using that as an excuse, as you certainly haven't managed to stop managing my schedule.  I just resent that my parents are so two-faced about issues. And the thing is, I can't really fight it or else it'll turn into some full-scale argument which will eventually result in the realization that no, they don't have to feed and clothe and house me, so they might as well just kick me out. It's AP season. I can't afford that right now.

      The mouse is sticky, probably from my sticky hands. My eyes itch and I rub until my eyelids are raw, but to no avail. I wrote "precise edges" on a random sheet of paper and I've forgotten why. I'm hungry, but the scales tell me I should skip random rummaging for food. What is this, anyways? I've never really cared what I ate. Hah, it showed. And now it's coming back at me. The only thing different  now is that going off campus actually encourages me to eat. Add on study hours (prolonged only by constant munching) and I probably should deliberately deprive myself of something just to make up for it. Dieting must be like sleeping. You satisfy your desires until you know you have to stop, but then it's unbearable.  Just came back from a piano lesson. I can play the Bach while Mr. Francis is in the other room, but once things get settled down proper I can't concentrate. Oddly enough, I'm not all too terrified for this Saturday. I just know it's going to be another nervous session, and performance will be heavily dependent on how I can control those nerves. So I tell myself I just have to consistently play at it this week. Maybe I'm so unfazed by regionals because of SATII tests. I need to study history, I haven't finished. Bio AP is officially two weeks from today, and I REALLY need to catch up on that one.  Argh. [rubs eyes]  Drive test: May 24, 3:20pm. Being the dork I am, I'm reluctant to miss school. And after I take the test, my first independent trip will be to Mr. Francis's house. Lovely.  Studying.

      I think the biggest kick I got out of tonight was talking to Keely. I sat right across from her. "So...have you been talking to Ryan much?" Turns out he went to the La Reina prom. I know how things go. I hope Pegleg saw him there and gave him a hard time. Knowing Pegleg, I'm sure he did something to that extent. I can just imagine. I am, by no means, jealous. Just insanely amused. "Guess who I talk to more?" Nights on the balcony.   I'm tired.  We saw this "cute" waiter at Macaroni Grill, too. When we walked in, he stared at me and for a second, I was just about to laugh and think that Scott had somehow transplanted himself down to TO and cut his hair. That's just not right. That's the second imaginary Scott sighting, hah. But it's funny enough, I see bits and pieces of YSP people wherever I go.  We're angry people around these parts.

      Got a birthday present. Don't think I want to stay past dinner.   It's exactly a month until I get my license. One month. That's too much, I say.  Ed the photographer's coming to Grandma's 80th birthday dinner. I'm repulsed. There's just something about him and mom's obsequiousness and...well, call me crazy, but he could be the perfect pedophile. Or I could see mom, in her helplessness and naivete, liking him too much.   It's really a matter of intuition, this Mom and (insert a male hired help/acquaintance here) kind of suspicion. I know it's completely unfounded, but I just get funny feelings sometimes. Mom, by nature, is just so helpless, so eager to depend on other people, even if they aren't family. First it was Mr. Jeng. While I was being tutored (for Analysis, but that's another story) she would always ask to borrow a book and then sit on the couch. And then ask to take the book home, etc. Or, "Is there something I can do?" And then always going over to the Jengs' house. Maybe it's because of CCCA. Or maybe it's something else. And then there's Ed. "Is my dress all right?" asked Mom in a truly infantile manner, dressed in a contraption probably purchased before I was born. Eyeshadow, too. I remember the time she just globbed that lavender stuff on for MT. Tiff, ever the nice one, rubbed it off for me. "That's too much," she said. Back to Ed [involuntary shudder]. I just can't believe Mom asked him to come. I was napping yesterday and heard her talking to him on the phone. Luckily (or not), I fell asleep soon after that. I simply can't imagine him sitting there with a bunch of our relatives eating as course after course comes in. That's just not right! He's supposed to take pictures again. Save me, please. I think I just might go to Jess's ASG dinner and stare at the Eiffel. And eat creme brulee.  This thing with Mom and adultery: I'm sure it's pure fabrication from an idle mind (mine). Or maybe. It's just that her personality naturally entails that she's just weak around white hired help. Or Mr. Jeng. But I get the sense that yes, Dad's pretty laid back (boring?). He doesn't come home until late. Even now, on a Saturday afternoon, he's at work. I've actually had dreams where Mom runs away with someone (gets a divorce?) and Dad, Austin, Grandma and I have this empty marble house to ourself. But I like it, strangely enough. If Mom weren't so needy I wouldn't be afraid at all. But because she is, I keep on churning out fancies.  Just make Ed go away. Please. I don't hate anything specific about the man. It's simply intuition. But being the heart over head person I am, I still don't like it.   I drive, and I see college decals in the back windows. I imagine the triumphant day when I can stick a Harvard one to mine. But then I laugh. Who am I kidding?

      Found it. 5:30-10:30. I need to find a birthday present now. Where would I go? I know she's into books, but I've already given her a Barnes and Noble gift certificate before. The mall? I don't know what she wears. Banana Republic, I know that much because I have a shirt just like her's except in a different color. I wonder if Jess is going tonight. She went to Anna's bday party years ago, before we were good friends. Oh, the eighth grade memories. I know it's typical of me, and it's terrible, but I wonder who's going and if I'll get along with them. So here's an icky question: should I leave early? There's a CWOTO tonight too. If I go tonight (and it's at 7:30) I'll be able to take math IIC tomorrow, but then I won't see Andrew or the rest of the people in the TO area. I don't think we got IIC packets last week. I still have 2 left over from when I was lazy. I should take a test out of a book with a scale. I want to get Clif's bio AP book.   I remember econ in Aca Deca freshman year: wants are unlimited...and then I forget the rest of it. Something about how supply is limited. Oh, econ.

      Slept. Slept through Austin getting sent off to Chinese school, slept through Grandma leaving for the hairdresser's, slept through Austin coming back. Slept through just about the entire Ballard study session. 12:15pm. I'm hungry. I wish we could go out to lunch for sandwiches but I discovered a huge pot of congee on the stove, so I know what we're having. I need to find Anna's bday invitation. The phone keeps on ringing for no particular reason and set off Jessy's keychain this morning. I then woke up.  It's another one of those what am I doing with my life? days. I think I'll study. I just realized I have to listen to a CD for piano and pick a piece before Monday. I probably want to practice Chopin before Monday. Arr, I just found a 15% off coupon that I could have used, but it's expired now. My room's still a mess, but only because I have insisted on keeping my birthday stuff out. I want to hang up Jessy's star lamp. I'm very much awake, and yet I feel like I'm not. Still in pajamas. Probably will be until I have to go somewhere.  I really don't know what I'm doing, and I'm ok with that.

      I'm addicted to the internet. Or maybe it's just a Friday night and I know I'm chained to the books and I really want something else to do. At any rate, when I found out that it didn't work at 8, I promptly retreated to the backup plan, Bailey. Fun. And now I'm here, yapping away when I'm not supposed to be.   Harvard plans(, Charles): I'm leaving on the 22nd and flying to Newark. I'll get to Boston by the 26th, but my parents are coming along and we're flying American. I think that was just the highlight of my day, talking to Dad about Harvard. It's going to be awesome. The rest of Friday, April 23 was simply mediocre.   And it's quiet. I like it. And then Steve IMs me. Thanks, Steve.

      At eight minutes before nine, I decided I didn't want to be in orchestra tonight anymore.   The first three first violins weren't here tonight, so I somehow ended up sitting first stand, second chair. At one point, I thought I heard Sean mutter something about "no leadership." I fear Sean. I always think he's going to say something bad about me, as I've heard him put down other people. And then there was this new part in the Shostakovich which was pizz, but I played arco and sounded like a proper fool. I don't know what it is about music and inferiority, but I've never felt comfortable with it. It's not something I can flaunt. I cower constantly in the shadow of more talented, more confident people.  Things to do tonight (as of 9:48pm): make brownies for earth club meeting, do Spanish APG work, study for math test, finish Hemingway reading and questions. I probably shouldn't have spent three hours on Bailey, but at least I started notecards again and I'm on chapter 40.  Being the masochist I am, I still wish I had strings pressing into my fingertips. I was really stupid tonight. I would've laughed at myself if I'd seen my performance.

      Before I truly begin, I need to remind myself that I'll cut down on the blogging today.  I fell asleep during standardized testing today and was so deep in dreamland that I felt as if I were truly in bed. The history section went beyond what I'd studied so far (chapter 37) so I felt partially idiotic filling in circles based on what spotty knowledge I have from US history years before. I'm actually glad testing comes right before APs, though. There's an excuse to bypass the sometimes needless banter of teachers (i.e. Ballard) so you can actually sit down somewhere quiet and study. I need to bring music next time, though.  I feel like an idiot, really. Cheated. May 22 is a Saturday, so I can get my license on May 24, at the soonest. I always thought the 22 was a Friday. Do I just not remember anymore? Maybe it was the 21st. It was May 21. And I just called the DMV, six months are up at midnight and I can't schedule until the 24th. What terrible luck.   Am getting increasingly annoyed with Mom. She doesn't exactly see why getting a driver's license is so important to me, and insists that even when I have a license I can't go anywhere without asking. My parents are perfectly tyrannical people sometimes. First it was "going to the movies with boys" freshman year which precipitated the "you need to go to private school to learn some discipline" period. Other campaigns to stop my normal growing up have included "you can't ride with teenage drivers" and picking me up before I ask them to. I'm just angry they can't understand. Control really isn't what a growing teenager needs when college is only a short time away.   It sickens me to see the average Chinese kid who ends up with no assertiveness or people skills because parents and culture have kept them so cooped up and only motivated by grades and college. Even worse, they're so brainwashed that they actually appreciate that kind of lifestyle. It's not a comforting example, but one of my cousins is like that. Almost sixteen, hasn't taken driver's ed. Painfully shy. I once heard the story by way of an old friend that he laughed at the f-word. Likes good food, my grandparents think he's too pampered. I respect him for other things, but seeing him just makes me resent being Chinese sometimes. What good is an academic overachiever if he has no people skills? Look around you, you know those people. Passive, with a one-track mind. And I'm probably one of them, too, and it's absolutely disgusting. How would I be now if I'd grown up free of these pernicious restraints?  I think a natural side-effect of intensive studying is apathy toward everything else. I don't know how to explain it, it's just a general feeling. There's things I want to do but I've only halfheartedly cared; I don't have the time. It's wanting, but not wanting. I don't know how it works.  It's that song again.

      realization: being online again probably diminishes your sense of self-worth. You realize your life, or your entertainment, is comprised of invariably self-centered observations from each party, of random comments to which the other party is at a loss to say something sensible. If anything, it's interesting to observe the mechanism of human communication within my small sphere of acquaintances. Mostly talked to friends today, though. I have so many people on my buddy list that I don't bother to talk to anymore but I don't dare take them off...people from summers ago, Abdul's multiple screennames, etc.  Hello, I don't even know what I want anymore. I have been fed. I've covered up to chapter 36 in Bailey, took another disappointing lit test, took a nap. Blogged excessively, but that just fulfills my introspective tendencies and I still deem it healthy. To think: this habit only started about a year ago, and now it seems very natural to write just about anything down. I wonder why I write. It's not because I really want these scattered thoughts to endure. Catharsis seems too strong a word for inconsequential insecurities of a 16-year-old girl. I probably blog more than anyone I know, but that only includes Enid and Jess. When I can't blog, I take the legal pad and the black pen, sit down and scribble anyways. What am I doing? It's not like I'm building myself up to be some great writer, since it's just little observations. It's written in the same language I use over again. I could pinpoint some trademark phrases of mine only because I repeat it so much.  I almost wish I could read something again that would make me just cry, run to the phone and stay there for an hour or two. But to think about the events leading up to it, I remember it's not going to be too pleasant. Why am I thinking about it too much lately? In all honesty, it was a childish infatuation that somehow lasted too long. I've overcome withdrawal even months ago. And yet, going home these next three testing days I don't want to see him at all. I imagine that he's taking down observations. About how much I've changed in...how many months? Four. Not bad, I think.  I want to do well on those darn SATIIs and APs so I can just sit back and coast, at least for a while. I want no post-test anxiety. I want something to be happy about. Tomorrow's one exact month until I can take my driving test. It's about time, I don't like standing waiting for Mom where all you can do is stare off in the direction of the cars and pretend that yes, you have something important to do.   Or maybe I should stop being the idiotic selfish person I am and see how other people are doing, really. I just talk about the same things over and over and over again.   alla luce dal sole

      I'm tempted to make some pompous, confident affirmation of self right now but I realize it's really not going to do me any good. There was a period of time when I thought, ok, I'm in control of things. But I'm not in the driver's seat right now.  It's not really troubling me, but I just know things change and the only thing I have to make sure to do is to see that I am still fundamentally me. Have I just put personality on hold in order to better pore through the study material without getting distracted? Is that healthy?  I'm sure in other times this would simply be classified as a moment of feminine weakness--in a general sense, thank you. Scarlett's aunt would just swoon and grab the smelling salts. What will I hold on to?

      "marble faun is not written by William Faulkner, it is written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Yes, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Come on, its a "college class, its a college class, its a college class!" hahahaah make me laugh"  Strong human self-righteousness is interesting. Faulkner wrote a Marble Faun too.  Interestingly, I see some of that in myself. Freshman year English I was very much that way. What a moron I was.  Just making sure we're still all on track.

      FDR had an affair.  Forgive my ignorance, but that simply shatters all my preconceptions about this historical figure, and it saddens me. As any other elementary school girl would, I did book reports on Eleanor Roosevelt. Marvelous woman. FDR is credited with many a marvelous thing too. And to think that he was also guilty of infidelity.  It's really a stupid fear right now, but I've always disliked that acidic tang to infidelity. Maybe it's just because it's coming from a starry-eyed, hopeless romantic raised in a culture where family and, in this situation, monogamy, are cornerstones. Mental imagery suggests FDR as a noble man. But he cheated on his wife, and she found out. Discussed divorce. Now what?  Perhaps Lucy Mercer was exactly what FDR needed in his bout of polio, in his WWII anxiety. Perhaps Lucy Mercer fulfilled all of the emotional requirements of love, of female companionship, where Eleanor never could. I can't really pass any judgment on Mercer except right now, without any background, I have a feeling she is horrid. Everyone commends Eleanor for her activism, for her involvement in public affairs. For the longest time, I just associated that with the role of a good wife.  new light.

      "Alejate, y dime adios."  Am trying to continue my streak of abstinence from all things that consume study time, i.e. AIM and television. Somehow the hours slipped by yesterday, but I also sense that I personally don't think this is going to hold up too long. Then again, how hard could it really be? With a little more effort, I will cover all the history material, prep for bio, and do enough lit practice tests to get me into testing mode.  Deep down, this doesn't bother me. It's not like I truly miss conversations with people just as busy as I am, and studying does me good. It's just getting used to it: like getting rid of people, almost. And here I laugh. So in a figurative sense, I'm going through withdrawal: who could not appreciate such an efficient system for styaing in touch? for socializing at the click of a button? AIM isn't necessary at all, but I've just been hooked on it for such a long time that I can't stop. A personal sense of victory is also driving me: Lydia, offline, for a whole entire day!  I can already predict that the most disheartening part of the day will be taking that practice test. I've also calculated that I can only take one a day before I a) go insane and more practically, b) run out of practice tests.  I just need something trifling to keep me busy. Listening to music now, which helps. I'm always tempted to munch away at something, but that's obviously not a healthy habit. Thankfully, there's really nothing good in the kitchen except pudding. It's silly: it used to be that when I had a lot to do, I wouldn't eat since I was just too busy with other things. But now, I want nothing more than to continually munch away, and that's not a good sign.  Weekend plans, since I always forget: Anna's birthday party on Saturday. I'm kind of hesitant to go but I already told her I would. I didn't ask her to mine (but I didn't ask Nigel either, so there) and it just seems kind of impolite. I used to be pretty close to her since the crux of our friendship was always that we were a year younger, and two days apart at that. But there things fork. She almost reminds me of that girl in A Walk to Remember: church, choir, hard-working. She's the only person I know who observes the Sabbath by doing no work on Sunday. Her mom's very nice; I saw her at Bach Festival. And I can't say that I'm as pure and straightforward as she is. I almost feel bad when people like Jordan mock "Can we say hi to Shelby?"  On a side note, I don't respect Nicholas Sparks as an author. Maybe as a storyteller. I can't believe I even read A Walk. Oversentimental rubbish, I say.  Saturday. Ballard study session, maybe, but if I can't keep interest on a normal day in his class I don't know what a good four hours will do. Sunday: CWOTO, 3:30pm. It's been a while, I missed the last two concerts, one because I plumb forgot and another on account of being away for the summer. I swear I had more to do than that, but that's ok too. It's the last weekend before the SATIIs, anyway.  To work, to work.

      See, I'm going crazy again.  Took another lit practice test. (fill in score here). Makes me wonder if I will have to bother reading through the actual explanatory sections. Checked out a practice book from the library, seven more tests. It just angers me how I can't do this, and it's probably exacerbated by the fact that I thought ok, lit should be easy, it's just CRITICAL READING.  So after a less-than-stellar (score), I really wish I could go online and talk to someone. I've been tempted to click on that stupid yellow button. I'm frustrated at myself, at my apparent stupidity, at the fact that I haven't yet mastered the nuances of the written word in a language I've been speaking practically all of my life. I missed fifteen out of sixty questions. That's a 75%, or a C, in the academic world. Lydia cannot afford to get C's.  Farewell to invincibility, I say, not that I had it in the first place. I know I can't go online. I can just see what'll happen: little superficial conversations about how everyone's tired, how school sucks, how SATIIs and APs are fast approaching. I don't care to discuss that with people right now, I have too much on my plate for idle talk. I know just about everybody who's going to show up online, since they're just about always online. I don't have anything to say to them except to convey an annoyance they probably can't understand, and I have no use for empty sympathy, either.  I don't remember this kind of despair before the SATIs. Maybe because then math was the lagging subject and there was actually something concrete I could study, something I could review. That Kaplan book is the only reason I did well.  10:03 pm. I wonder what I'm going to do for the rest of the night. I can't go online, I won't let myself stoop down to that level. I have the bio book stored away in the media room cabinet, I should go retrieve it. I'll put in eye drops or something since my eyes are itchy. I see my bad test paper. I took a green marker to it: green, the color of hope. Twenty points more, what hope is that? I can study history, I need that by May 1. Ballard is as boring as hell, very sorry to offend any of you. Dad's feeding information into my right ear about visiting colleges this summer, and even though I want to go I really don't need to hear it right now. It's really not a joke anymore. I think tomorrow I'm going to whip out my study book and start reading during Ballard's tangents. Oh wait. I don't have him tomorrow. Even better.  I'm sorry, but I just feel like a weak, helpless loser right now.  At least I'm listening to the Postal Service. [RUBS ITCHY EYES]

      Not for the queasy.  I've been thinking about cutting down on meat consumption, especially lately. Within the past three days I've had duck and chicken, prepared in the Chinese way: cooked whole, chopped up at the table. It then follows that everything's still there: I've identified a pancreas, at least, and have been too afraid to go any further. I can see the connective tissue, the muscles running in beautiful arcs. And we eat this.  Maybe it's time to take a partial Steve approach. A drumstick is terrible enough: you can identify the types of bone at the top of the joint. You can find the femoral vein, I think. You see the filmy CT. Cut apart, you can see the marrow. Even a large chunk of flesh is appalling when you can imagine the different bundles running every which way, when you think of it as a disgusting cross section.   I remember an essay: humans as carnivores are ok as long as we take care to treat the livestock humanely. Free range chicken, etc. But I still don't understand how that helps. Maybe it just prevents Slaughterhouse 5 or The Jungle situations, but as an omnivore who is simply concerned that meat consumption means you eat the carcass of something similar to you, that's no comfort.  This is my twisted solution, as I see it. And it probably only applies to me. Either the meat has to be processed, prepared, or portioned so that I can't really notice the parts of it (hi! a ligament!) or I don't eat it at all for fear of gagging. Emotionally, a hot dog is ok as disgusting as that may sound. Eating one, I can't see where it came from. Chicken in small chunks. Luncheon meat. Pepperoni. Sausage. And I must stop now lest I list all the pizza toppings.  I really think that's why I stopped eating fish that's either steamed whole, as we are accustomed to doing in this house, or just a cross section somehow. After dissecting perch in Patenaude's freshman biology, I'm just not comfortable eating something where I can tell you that the kidney runs along the spine. I don't want to remember that I removed a whole entire egg sac from this stinking yellow fish--I remember on the first day my gloved hand reached into a bucket of yellow preserving fluid where these dead fish were floating and had to grasp one, pick one. And I really don't like the fact that it can stare at me back. After perch, I think I can only take fish in processed fillet form, or fish paste.   And now science aims to take away the majority of meat in my diet. I'm letting it, though. Fetal pig definitely exposed me to the internal structure of animals. I remembered that the pancreas looks like a pouch of marbles, and that haunted me until the day I saw it in the duck. And mink this year is probably the biggest factor. I really don't mind dissecting it, but it exposed me to the orientation of muscles. You could cut away one and find another band running in an opposite direction. It was all so structured. And now, in chicken, I am so much more conscious that you can peel away layers too, and see the CT ripping along as you go.  This is no vegetarianism, but maybe just selective meat-eating. In a backwards way, it's leading me to processed food, never appreciated as much as the original. When was the last time you heard anyone singing praises for a hot dog or a fish stick?  After dinner I thought, wow, I should really stop eating this stuff, especially if I'm going to take apart a human cadaver next year. And then I think, that's it, I need comfort food, let's do Jello.  And then I realize Jello's made out of gelatin--animal hooves.  Yum yum.

      I just finished my first Faulkner.   I can't say that he's as brilliant as Fitzgerald in terms of prose, but there are highlights: "...from where he sat he could see the ranked shelves close-packed with the solid, squat, dynamic shapes of tin cans whose labels his stomach read, not from the lettering which meant nothing to his mind but from the scarlet devils and the silver curve of fish." And "hermetic meat."  It took me a while to finish "Barn Burning," and at times the person carrying out the action was so mixed up by jumps in plot and vague pronouns that I didn't know what was going on. I think I have a sense, but I can't say I'm sure. It's good, though. But it's that thinking man's novel; I can't sit down as if I were reading contemporary fiction and just skim through it.  At any rate, I'm inspired. Faulkner seems like another author to love just for the prose, and even more: the regionalism was a major element of "Barn Burning" but it wasn't pervasive or so central to the plot that it inhibited understanding, so I'll be ok. Before, I was afraid that this heavily southern setting would make for an experience like, say, a caucasian reading Joy Luck or me reading Arranged Marriage.   Of course, I'm just typing away like nuts because I'm not going online today. Oh, it hurts to finally say that, and definitively. My eyes are already dry, but they were itchy before; it's probably from allergies. Listening to Mom's Josh Groban CD--I'm surprised she has it--and enjoying the fact that half of it is in Italian, so I won't have to listen in for the words.  I have anatomy car wash tickets! It's going to be May 2 from 10am to 2:30pm in the parking lot, $5 each car. Help me get rid of them. Hah.

      to highlight my ignorance and my bigotry: I didn't know anything about William Faulkner before the Harper's reading and when I first read that he was from Mississippi, I thought, wait, that must be a mistake. With a name like Faulkner, I thought he'd be from somewhere European or at least New England. It's simply a mindset, and a terrible one. I discovered that I really don't know anything about the southern region of our country, because I really didn't think any literary lights would emerge from a place like Mississippi.  Oh, I am horrible.  But now I really want to read this Faulkner, the "greatest twentieth century writer of fiction." And the time period's just about right, so would I study him this summer in modernism and postmodernism?   Back to work.

      Pensive again.   It's two weeks until the first AP of lovely AP season, the English Language test.   Two weeks.  On May 1, I'll be taking the SATIIs for writing, literature and US history. Let's start with that one: I just took a practice test for lit. (insert test score here). I'm not going to settle with that, but it also means changing a mindset somehow and practicing over and over again. I'll have to visit the library. I'm hoping writing will be halfway decent, and history directly depends on how much I take the AP to heart. It's just lit that's bothering me right now. Anything above a (score), I'll be thrilled. Above (score), ok. Anything below, I've screwed some mechanism up. I'm sure this sounds strange or unreasonable to some people, but I can say honestly that these are my goals, and not achieving them (i.e. a (score)) tells me I have a lot more work to do.  And that's just hurdle number one. Then there's also Bach Regionals, which rests basically on my ability to calm down and execute a simple prelude and fugue flawlessly. I need to watch my practice time (more) and curb performance anxiety.  Followed by two weeks of APs. Bio is going to need quite some work, especially when I just decided to give up on RESPIRATION. I'm sure all of you are laughing by now. Respiration. And not even to the Krebs cycle yet, just glycolysis. Spanish is just a matter of luck, maybe. I don't know what to think about it. I think it's difficult for everybody, and I just don't know where the curve is. Or how mediocre I can afford to be to still get a 5.  If it looks like it's going to get bad, AIM's going to go. I'm hesitant to delete it altogether, but I really can't click on that stupid yellow man. I'll start blocking people just to keep my mind on track, maybe. So there, Ellis is blocked.   I can sense that this is simply the beginning of something much greater than I am, that in the next few weeks it'll be mental exercise and exertion like no other. This, probably, is more junior year than anything. It just makes you shiver because you know you're just about to go over the top, you see it coming and you feel yourself slowing down and hanging at equilibrium before the plunge. I'm shivering already.  Maybe I shouldn't go to the hospital tomorrow. It's going to be my second week in a row missing, but I also can't afford to hand over four hours of my time on one night. But I need some way to make sure that yes, I'll skip hospital and yes, I'll study.   TUESDAY'S PLAN OF ATTACK:  skip Los Robles visit the library instead for more SATII lit practice catch up on Bailey chapters, make notecards if I'm daring enough read more Princeton cover at least two more chapters in bio, preferably more Hemingway reading, separation of thematic periods for English AP talk to Battaglia and/or Freeman about studying  Game face.

      I love it how I form half conjectures, type them out incoherently and then erase them all. What does this say about me, really? All the time I think of what I should write for next issue's column. I'm sure some would call that sick, but I think it's my personal space, and I might as well get somewhere with it. The key is direction. Any normal column/editorial won't do.   It says a lot about me, too. Writing LL has been about truths and communication and fatigue and school. A strange collection, yes. Does this tell me (or anyone, for that matter) that my brain is geared toward human interaction? success? or little petty desires easily fulfilled?  I don't know if I'm the only one who does this, but I take mental vacations all of the time. I was practicing and all I could think of was Indian culture--through E, and M, and reading Arranged Marriage. I used to write letters in my head running errands at Los Robles. I just have a strange imagination: I also have to quantify everything, and if something's random, I have to imagine slips of paper drawn out of a hat, etc.  end of thought. more later.

      Ummmmm, yeah.  I haven't collected myself just yet. I really don't know this time, and it's bad. It's just confusion in a can or something. I'm just sitting here and I have a whole bunch of stuff around me: math packets, markers, tape, opened letters, a plate for a brownie already consumed. I wish I had Norah playing, but then again I'm too lazy to retrieve it, and it's probably nearing dinnertime.  Everybody knows spring break has to end sometime. I was conscious of the fact, and always, but I didn't prepare myself. On Friday or Saturday I didn't go ok Lydia, this is it, you better get your homework in order, clean up your room, just get ready, etc. So now I'm sitting here, as I've said before, and just cramping and feeling lost. Maybe I'll do the Alamo review tonight. I don't know if we're obligated to finish the Spanish AP work since we were given all the answers.   I just wish I could clean up, maybe. That'd be a healthy start.  Brainache. I can't sit in that math class for two hours and listen to the rules of logic that I learned the summer before ninth grade. Wow, it seems like a long time ago, and it isn't. Test scores are improving, but slightly. I'm sure there's an easier way around some of the problems I do.  School predictions tomorrow: we'll get yelled at by Freeman for not doing the reading. Spanish will just be a pain, but that's nothing new. Math test coming up. Physio coldness, maybe a new chapter? Journalism mayhem, Ballard's super dallying in honor of spring break, Derky hell, as usual.  Making a face.

      A few hours ago, you'd probably see a distraught Lydia ailing with a headache from lack of something to do. Near tears: boredom sucks.  And now it's not that bad. I'm tired, but that's just a minor side effect. Told myself I wouldn't act like a shameless loser and go online at all, but here I am. I say that it's been an ok day, I might as well indulge.    In the process of getting rid of boredom, I have acquired yet another "Harvard crimson" shirt. I've been eyeing it for a while, though, so I say that justifies my splurging. I'm going to wear it the day of the history AP. Maybe. It's comfortable, I'm wearing it now with the tag on. I ponder the psychology of buying on sale. I like it better since it's spending less money, but I can imagine there are some blue bloods out there who would never stoop as low as picking something up from the sale racks. Maybe their reasoning is that once they wear it it'll be so obviously out of season already? I wouldn't know. But then again, retail stores need sales, and people to buy sale items. That's the only way they can clear off old clothing. Anyways. I like sales, and if it makes anything better I never saw this shirt in Abercrombie before, only online. And yeah, now I am obviously wandering into the territory of the disgustingly superficial. Moving on, shall we?  Grandma has acquired a taste in Orange Julius. One of the girls behind the counter reminded me of a girl on the Real World. (arr, so much pop culture has infiltrated into my observations. I guess that's what spring break does to you). She also said, "I almost wish I hadn't agreed to letting you skip a grade so you could stay around longer and drive me around." Prefaced with a "You'll laugh, but..."   K called on my birthday, and I think I remember saying I'd call him back the next day. I didn't, so he called today and left a message with Mom telling me to call after 7pm. So am I to feel like an ogre? He got into Cal, so that makes him and Abdul, at least. Except..wait, I don't know if Abdul's going to HMC. K's a neat kid, really. I just don't know what I'd say to him on the phone. Maybe it's just overthinking, I"ll just call him up.   After jello fish, though. Austin came into the media room/Lydia's den and conveyed some sense of boredom, so we hatched up a crazy plan to go to Vons and get jello and make a huge jello fish. So yeah. Now we also have four flavors of jello, instant pistachio pudding, and brownie mix in the pantry. We'll have to wait until dinner's over for use of the stove, though. It's going to be interesting, no less.   It's the last weekday of spring break. Maybe it's for the better, I had to take Tylenols to alleviate that boredom headache. Tomorrow's Colburn (and arranging rides first) and Sunday's playing piano with Andrew. AP Andrew, Ellis.  The housekeeper is ever intent on getting us all to the dinner table. Drives me nuts. I prefer the tactic of delay, but it starts getting on my nerves.

      Sylvia got into Princeton. And Stanford. I'm happy for her. I just start wondering where I'm going to end up next year.  Dad said he'd stay home today for spring break, and then he decided to go to work anyways. And he just got home.

      Frustrated unexpectedly, and I know I shouldn't be; it's just a spoiled girl mentality. I just don't get how Mom, inspired by the fact that she was a little too slow at Costco yesterday to read that they, too, could record pictures onto CDs, went out to Fry's today to get a $1500 computer. With a CD burner. Mind you, she doesn't even know where the camera software is. May I wish her the best of luck? Yes, I will, because I predict it'll be another Mom-Austin yelling fight before she unearths the darn program. Um, yeah.  Arr, I can't wait to get out on my own in this world. And I can't really understand why I'm angry, either. Maybe it's that I'm going away over the summer with the oldest laptop in the house that doesn't even have a battery anymore. But I'm glad I'm going, getting some fresh air. I think we need some brilliant Asian kid to go crazy because of the pressure just once. It should scare the parents into submission, wouldn't it?  So it's this weird month or so when I'm 16 but I don't have a license. I wish I had the sense on October 13 to run into the DMV to take that test, since I think I had driver's ed done by then anyways. But maybe I was too busy. And then Dad wasn't in town that other time we went.   I just don't know what to do at home anymore. Finally tackled some bio today, but I quickly got bored and doubted the effectiveness of my short-term memory by the time the second Monday in May rolls around. But I think some of the physio material is in there, which is nice. Didn't do any history: hit chapter 16, decided to take no notes, and 17 is similarly uneventful. What would I do, though? I have Norah Jones stuck in my head, which is a good sign. I just took Grandma out for errands, when I discovered I wouldn't be driving her car (laughs bitterly). And I want ice cream cake again. I could watch Lost in Translation. Or bad TV. Ah, but this is silly. I've been awake for less than five hours, and I've already run out of things to do.   Best American Essays was satisfying, though. "How old is your son Cello?" And why do I find so many subtle confessions of homosexuality in there? Maybe it's just because I'm sheltered. It's not the first time I've read it. The medical writer is in it again, Atul Gawande, I think. I want to do something like that: practice medicine and write for the New Yorker. Maybe.   Wish me luck. I think I just might be going insane.

      Raspberry is an awesome flavor. Tell me when it isn't good. Raspberry danish filling, raspberry jam, chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  Of course, you can tell that eating has been too high of a priority lately.  And...I've run out of things to say. Already. Yay for raspberry.

      I woke up before noon. (Not bad, don't you think?)  Sleep is a blessing. I don't know what I'd do otherwise. I'm in running shorts and an old t-shirt and I don't know what else to do. Am full from lunch. Probably will make more notecards and listen to music.   But it's almost like you keep things down on purpose because you've had something so good and you just tread lightly so you don't disturb that kind of peace. I don't want to clean up my room. I just want to leave everything the way it is. For now, at least. I'm sure after spring break I'll start working upstairs again, but I need the media room now. I wonder where all my study materials went after last night.  It's Austin's birthday today, but he doesn't seem to be having all that much fun. It appears that it's just another spring break morning spent at the computer. It's almost tragic: his away message is something about a "somber birthday." I don't remember turning 14. (thoughtful pause) Yes I do. It wasn't all that great. I just wish I could sneak him out somewhere and make him happy? but he's having dinner with friends on...Saturday.  Things to do, maybe, on Saturday. Hah, I just remembered. Colburn. Earth Day activities.   I need to delete AIM, I really, really do. Or maybe I'll keep it on and just delete it when it really matters. or just stay invisible for a very very long time. I don't know what to make of it: I know it's not as good as a face-to-face conversation and usually you go on to make small talk and pretend you're doing something amusing. And sometimes you stay up until 5:30 talking to people. Ahem.

      "I could die right now, Clem.  I'm just happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm just exactly where I want to be."  That, and NIMROD, thanks Jess.  I've cleaned up all relevant birthday paraphernalia from the kitchen, but I don't want to touch anything more. What will I do tomorrow? Anything from now on is basically anticlimactic. If I had to go back to school tomorrow, I'd be satisfied already.  Everything's so right, and priceless. I wish I could sit here painlessly and just sit here. There's only so many perfect days, this is the third I really remember in recent history. Let's keep it that way.   So here I am. I have a Death Cab chorus playing over and over in my head: "I loved you Guinevere, I loved you Guinevere, I loved you..." And repeat.  Life is good. I don't need to get caught down here so late, though. We'll see.

      Happy birthday to me. Not yet, though. 8:33 pm.  11:30 just seems a long way off. I've already showered, listened to Death Cab, done some notecards for history. Hoping the hours go by quickly until 11:30, and then wishing every moment stays.  Collecting red envelopes. I always feel bad opening them just after you get them, as if you were eagerly awaiting the $20 bill inside. I'll have a hard time growing up, hah. No more free money like this when...is it when you marry? and then you have to pass them out. I know it's still money, but I have a hard time spending it too. As I hand the bill to the cashier thoughts run through my head: this was last touched by Grandma, who gave it to me as a birthday present. And then, at that precise moment I'd rather spend another $50 bill. I am too sentimental about things. Leads to being a packrat. I have a hard time thinking money is money and I might as well use it since the next bill is worth jsut as much as the last.  Had another thirsty dream. Maybe it was from noodles last night.  I really don't feel 16.

      Saw the Alamo. Don't think I've sat down for such a boring movie in personal history without turning it off. I get this weird feeling, though. It'll just suffice to say that I'd probably be more comfortable going with a group of friends. Came home and decimated dinner. Don't know what that means. Decimate. Roman (or Greek?) soldiers took one out of ten soldiers in a platoon and killed them. Randomly. I'll have to look that up again someday.  I've been thinking (and here I sound like Jim Casy) that I've done a bunch of silly, mercurial things. I think it's time to stop. I can count them off in a chain. That makes four already. It's not even within my personality. And I don't even know what I want.  It's this late already? oh, the ways I spend my time...  afterthought: tonight's the last night I'm 15. Hard people I know would just tell me it's jsut another day, a milestone for the passage of time, and maybe I agree. But I'm 16 tomorrow. Might as well make something out of it? Perception-wise, 15 is still lame, still little. Sixteen is sweet sixteen and growing up. Emotionally, mainly. I hope things will take care of themselves. I think I need to just tire myself out toinght doing something random so I can go to sleep. But I've finished wrapping the 40-odd presents, so no solace there. No eating, that's overdone. No reading, nothing good around. Let me think of something.

      There's a special sting to things when people say no. For one moment, you just have this anger pushing out from the inside and you just feel horrible. Then you go to your room, lay on the bed and breathe. But I'll laugh now. Another excursion today would have been unreasonable.  I just hope next year's spring break will be better. At least I'll drive by then, and then excursions galore. It's 1:34. I woke up at 10:45 and already I've run out of things to do.

      Monday morning. Was practicing piano until I read the monthly bulletin and realized there was no lesson today. Argh. It then follows that I have no motivation whatsoever to practice.  Everything is better with hot sauce, or so I have discovered.   John from the Examiner finally sends me back an email saying they want to run a cultural section for the May 6 issue. Do I want to do it? It kind of makes me feel queasy. But it's good work. I start thinking of college again, stupid me.   Couldn't go to sleep last night. Imagined that I could drive and I'd parked Dad's car in this long parking lot, but I'd neglected to lock it. Then thieves stole it, along with 75% of the other cars in the parking lot. I couldn't help crying and saying sorry to Dad and thinking I'd never get a car of my own. And I had this dream twice. It'll be a sign. When I get my own set of keys I'll make sure the word LOCK or something is tattooed to my hand.  But I'm paranoid.

      So the blog works again. Such comfort.  I'm in an ironic mood. I guess the passage of time, especially time spent doing nothing but eating and watching tv, just has to make you laugh at yourself for having nothing to do. But it's Easter, not that it matters. Yes, it does. Nothing good on, except crucifixion specials. I'm not interested.  See, I don't even know what to think anymore. I really need this downtime since during an ordinary week I'd be perfectly starving for it, but this absence of anything to do just makes me...laugh. It's mainly my fault. Not in the mood for any more history studying since I'm not allowed to hook up the iPod anyways. Maybe I'll wrap those last five packages, but I've become increasingly disgruntled by imperfect corners. Afraid to go to the library, since books will take a dangerous importance over everything else, but I still want to read up on Best American Essays. And I don't want to touch that bio book, as stupid as it sounds. Mind over matter.  I just console myself that everything leading up to Tuesday is worth that one fantastic day, and I'm all right with that. Who knows what I'll do after Tuesday. I dare not imagine. Tomorrow I'm going to have to clean up the piles and piles of miscellaneous clothing in the closet and draped over chairs and on top of dressers, and organize it somehow so that I can wash it. And then I predict it's going to be at least a few hours on the piano in anticipation for the lesson. Maybe I'll revive the Schumann. I'm in no mood to start the Chopin just yet, and I don't even remember if I finished the Schumann. That's tomorrow's work. And then the Alamo, at 7:05. And then TUESDAY!!  Maybe I'm crazy.  I really hope Jess is ok with taking me, though. I've been wanting to go back to Third Street for a long time and I just love that feel of driving along PCH. But I'm not quite sure her parents (or her, for that matter) are exactly as thrilled as I am. And I don't mean to drag her along for birthday excess spending when she feels left out of it. Don't even know if Tiff is coming. For her good, though, I do hope she goes to Disneyland. But will it work out?  I've been trying as hard as I can not to let that upsetting spring break nothingness feeling settle on me, and it's working all right, I suppose. I have a considerable pile of notecards for USAP. Funny enough, nothing pleases me more than seeing that multicolored pile grow, and I find myself learning things that I missed the first time around. Maybe I'll actually get a 5 this year, arr. I hope one day I'll wake up in the morning and decide it's the right time for bio. At any rate, I've taken over the media room, and fortunately I haven't dozed off on that marvelous couch yet. I just hate waking up early in the morning and getting a bowl of oatmeal plopped in front of you at the table even though you haven't had a decent breakfast for the past...oh, since September. I can't count backwards. I hate listening to the phone ringing, that disgusting yellow glow on the walls right before noon, 2 pm. I hate lunch when I'm still not hungry, trying to get back to work on a full stomach when all my body wants to do is slow down and digest. It's simply a whole different rhythm, and being the little freak I am I'd almost prefer school. If I could drive myself off campus for lunch.  Last night was a good time.  If I have a spring break theme song, "Photobooth" would be it. Never mind the lyrics, I just like the kind metallic clang at the beginning, the first few verses. Laid back. Lovely. Have to get the CD. It will be driving music, I promise.

      Word of the day:  Main Entry: unc·tu·ous  Pronunciation: '&[ng](k)-ch&-w&s, -ch&s, -shw&s Function: adjective Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French or Medieval Latin; Middle French unctueux, from Medieval Latin unctuosus, from Latin unctus act of anointing, from unguere to anoint 1 a : FATTY, OILY b : smooth and greasy in texture or appearance 2 : PLASTIC   3 : full of unction; especially : revealing or marked by a smug, ingratiating, and false earnestness or spirituality - unc·tu·ous·ly adverb - unc·tu·ous·ness noun   I wish I could just have colorful characters come to 1161 Oak Mirage every day. Maybe not.   The photographer's here. It tends to make one self-conscious--in my mind, I'm the only one who can stare at my own face for the sake of staring at it. Not today. Just little fragments that define people: the Durango in the driveway, a penchant for forgetting names, unctuousness. A body reminiscent of R's.  And a new body in the house makes me realize what kind of person I am, too. What's your favorite author? Composer? What're your hobbies? I can't answer one of them. Maybe it's because Fitzgerald doesn't immediately come off my tongue or I don't care to share that I love any romantic composer that just makes me melt or that I have a nasty habit of writing and writing and writing. I just don't think that this middling man in polos and khakis really needs to know. So I wonder, how do I begin to trust adults? Maybe it's when they're in the same situation as I am, not some sort of master/subordinate kind of thing. Maybe I only start to trust when I approve of what they do. Photography is not something I adore.  I don't like my mom around adults, either. I am very, very glad I do not have her personality, but my dad's. Mother dear is fidgety as hell and very very conscious of her appearance. Oh, I'm a hard one to satisfy. Eyeshadow. An old dress. "Is this all right?" Maybe it's silly, but I've always been afraid for Mom when she's around hired older men. First of all, the man is under her control, since she's paying for him. But he's trying to sell something too. This isn't the first time--the electrician raised an eyebrow of mine, too. My mother is too easy to please. With this knowledge, I don't want to know what she was like when she was dating Dad, who is a quiet, laid-back soul.   Drove on the freeway to Fry's today. Almost crashed the car coming out of the parking lot: tried to turn left across a wide road, and it took forever to wait for traffic both ways to subside. Eventually, the car behind honked and I acted on instinct and charged across. There was a gold sedan coming straight at me and my dad made a noise, but somehow, I felt so calm. I knew she wasn't going to crash. I don't know how that happens.  Get me out of these shoes and dress.

      T's bday/bf woes. I don't know what to say, it's weird. I don't understand why her parents are getting on her case when mine don't even seem to care so much anymore except for the occasional annoying interrogation session. Sure, she's way busy--busier than I am, I venture--and as a result the grades aren't going to hold up as well, but that's the way it goes. What do they want out of her? But it's the bf issue too. I think my parents would undergo a stage of suspicion if they ever discovered that I had one. Just talking to people like T and A make me appreciate that I can sleep in, that I can just sit there and wrap presents as I damn well please, that I can at least go to Santa Monica on Tuesday. But that's not going to help T, is it?  Reading R's profile. Sometimes it makes me kind of itch to see what they're writing about. And part of me doesn't care, as usual.  Aah, it's probably been more than an hour. And it's time for more listening to loud, loud music. Or wrapping presents.

      Trying to keep the computer time down to less than an hour. Let's see how long it will be before I break.  It felt like a good, solid day today--at least I don't get couch potato headaches just yet. Woke up at 11, made lunch with Grandma, went to Costco and Michaels for wrapping paper, wrapped 21 boxes of bowls. I think I'm going to do more; there's nothing like wrapping presents, especially when there's 43 of them. I think the only person weirder than me in this sense is the wife of Aaron Spelling, TV producer, who has a room dedicated to wrapping presents. Not like I really care, but a random tidbit. Did some history, not as much as yesterday. There's nothing like sitting in the media room with the curtains wide opening and music blaring. Death Cab for Cutie is good. More room for wuss rock appreciation.  We're taking family pictures tomorrow. Photographer at 2, pictures at 3. I really wonder how they turn out, because I'm really sure Dad's smirk mixed with Austin's cocky grin and my lost stare don't mix together very well. And we wear nothing that matches, not that it really matters in real life.  It's Good Friday today. I didn't even know that. How sad.   Back to work. Austin's trying to tell me a crappy joke and I don't want to hear it. Hi Austin.

      Did some history. Almost fell asleep, but ironically Bailey work woke me up. Hard work is actually not that bad, and it's satisfying to observe that pile of notecards growing. Listened to disturbingly loud iPod music in the media room. It could have been a dance party...only I was perched on the couch with notecards sprawled out on the ottoman, with Bailey open. Let the neighbors think we're wild children, yes.  Unusually quiet for 10:05, when I'm actually stirring to action on a normal day. It's a Friday night complex, when everyone thinks it's the last weekday and they're probably swarming the movie theatres and the restaurants and what have you. I like my quiet day, though. Tomorrow, I hope, will be satisfyingly noisy.  It's weird to see D with other girls--like L today. "Lydia, isn't it true that...?" I don't answer. D gives me a smile, like "I know the answer!" Goofy child. Maybe it's just overprotectiveness. Not possessiveness, I don't need it. Tiff made the observation that it was very interesting how he associates with similarly vapid, naive people.  Masochistic me--I'm pensively biting lips again and I didn't even notice until a few seconds ago.  And wait--I'm not done. Talked to Dorothy today, and I'm getting the same weird feeling I got from Wendy. It just really makes me wonder: am I equally dysfunctional? Stupidly captivated? Or have I just not seen enough concrete evidence to knock some sense into me? Character analysis is in order.

      Had a celebratory lunch: fried chicken (Enid, that's the second time I've been tempted to type "friend chicken" now) while watching bad afternoon television.  I got into Anatomy, but what's worse, people who I thought should get in didn't, and people who I really didn't like got in. Erum's in it, and so are Nigel and Tiffany Chang. And that's really sad--those are the only three people who I think I'd get along with well. It's petty, but I'm really not in the mood for another "how are ya?" conversation right now. Nimo didn't make it in. Neither did Wendy. I'm sorry, but that's just lame. And I start to think, should I have counted myself as lucky to have made it in when two of the smartest people in the junior class didn't get in? But then again, what kind of luck is being just as lucky as BM?   I don't like her. (Forgive me, I do think I am drama queen today.) To someone in the hall: "Hello, darling." What the heck is that? That's like being called "pun'kin" by the lady at the checkout line at Ralphs, but coming from B. (Involuntary shudder.) She copies homework, is flagrantly dishonest. Is a priss. Doesn't stay on task in Freeman. Maybe is bi. Annoying as hell. When I think of her in terms of a noise, it's it's a fake laugh. And H too. Didn't Bowman say she wasn't going to let her in because she was off task? I don't like her either. Nor do I appreaciate M.   Hah. You must be reading this and thinking I'm some dysfunctional character. Maybe I am. I'm laughing at myself: I don't get along very well with other people. Even worse, I have no qualms about it.  But otherwise, today was all right. Keira made me a bday cake in journalism and we all sang, which was so nice of her. Jean and Amanda wished me happy birthday. So many people are going away for break: J's going to Spain, P to England, Ireland and Wales, K to France. Actually, it wasn't bad. I'm just tired. And I hope I go shopping with Tiff tomorrow, but you never know.  Spring break outlook: a birthday won't make it so bad. A's coming along to the party too. She was asking me in history when my birthday was...and it kind of felt weird not asking her along since she came with us when we celebrated Enid's. I smile already, it's going to be so much fun. So many good people. Aaaaah, maybe I'm just attributing too much importance to this one day. But it's going to be a good time, I can just feel it.  May 1 is going to be hell: SATII times 3, Bach regionals, and now an AA car wash.

      "It's on page 478 of the Communist Manifesto, if you ever want to read it."  Typical Ryan. Erum is way cool (for want of a better adjective) but the group presentation just chewed the few pages of Grapes Ch. 19 to death. The one thing that makes me feel absolutely queasy about the subject is overanalysis. In my humble opinion, maybe it's better that we don't find evidence of Grapes parallels with the Communist Manifest, page 478. I'm for holistic reading. BS is good for impressing adults. But coming from students? It's sickening. I have a feeling our presentation also overdoes it, but I can say that it's slightly shorter than 40 minutes. Maybe. I'm proud of our group, though. Doupe and Vince came up with some especially enlightening material, contrary to personal prediction.  Otherwise, I'm so blah right now I have nothing intelligent to say. I'm almost tempted to map out a busy spring break, but I really need to study all of bio AP, which troubles me. I'm more excited about making color-coded USAP notecards, if that makes any sense at all. It doesn't. Forget it. Wednesday is not a day for coherent thoughts. (And I just asked myself, IS IT WEDNESDAY? Yes, it is. I'm not that off track)  I can't even talk anymore. I dropped a take-out box full of rice at dinner. Salvageable, but still annoying. Not in control of my reflexes today.

      And another thing: Charle. has decided that maybe it's time to patch things up, but I don't know how I'm going to handle it on my end. So she asks me about the status quo and making new friends, etc. And then we get into discussing nasty letters, bitter gossip, drifting apart.  I still don't know what to make of it. Ryan, Tiff and I used to be so close that everything would just mush together into one vague consciousness. But we were mean to each other too. It was a competition, and I don't know how many times I had to hear that "the group dynamics of three are complicated." I told Ryan and Tiff a slew of things with too much trust. And sometimes we ganged up on each other--it was just the way we were structured. One day I thought ok, this is shit, I'm not going to let them make fun of me like that anymore, no matter how jokingly the letter was written.  Don't get me wrong, I am no drama queen, but I didn't see the point in being "friends" with people who called you rude and arrogant, etc. It was hard, to start with. But I'm satisfied with the way I've restructured, as unfeeling as that may sound.  I'm talking to Charle. again, but not Ryan. I don't think I could ever make it up to him because most directly it was my fault. It's not a nice thing to say, but I don't think it's worth the humility to restore our funny trio and to risk getting hurt again. I usually don't cut people off. But maybe he's an exception. I have too much hidden in him, and I don't to see it out in the open again.  I can't go back, it's a part of growing up. And if I'm so strong now, why would I ever discard that for something less?

      Remind me: staying up until 2am talking online will only translate into fatigue like no other. Slept the last ten minutes of the physio test--but I was done, anyways. Nodded off in Ballard until Ashley hissed, "LYDIA!" periodically. Drifted off at the hospital. Ellis is right, 4.5 hours will not get you anywhere.  Tiff, Butch from radiology really scares me. We were standing outside because we closed early today and he was outside too with another radiology crony of his, and they were totally listening to what we were saying and using that as basis for their own, independent conversation. We whistled, they whistled. Andrew and Ashley tried to show me how, and they just did. We pulled out our cell phones, they mocked us.  Mmm, some funny rumors circulating about me? Ah, but what are they worth? Anyone in his right mind would know that I am too much of an ascetic to do something like that. Jean would know. But I am vicious, I can't stop. Maybe it's little submerged incidences, and I just get lucky by giving up at just the right time.  When Doupe's serious, it scares me somehow. Usually he just says something off-the-wall and then either you laugh first or he snickers/chuckles in his odd little way. Or it's that you're supposed to be serious and then it's not a big deal. But when he chooses to keep a straight face, he all of a sudden looks as old as he's supposed to be. Strikingly abnormal.  Random pensamientos. I am becoming scatterbrained.

      I haven't had pruney skin in a long time now. But I guess today's the day, so what the hell. I feel so weird for putting the stereo in the bathroom, but hey: better than thinking to yourself, it's something to make you think POSTAL SERVICE for you. And here Enid would roll her eyes and mention the name of some recondite, more sophisticated band. Sorry, Enid.  Mrs. Battaglia has just discovered my penchant for dangling modifiers. Sorry, Mrs. B. I'm not tempted to change it at all. Journalism's actually ok, but probably because we've pushed deadline a day back. Page one just has the strange teaser pic that can only be fixed by Jonathan...actually, thinking about it, I think I screwed it up enlarging it in Pagemaker. Page 2 should be done, provided that Mrs. B. read it and printed it off today. And if she's closing it, I hope she took that top picture up before it's errors type 1, 2 or 3 again. Page 3 is in the box. Dorothy did decently well this issue, but she still has room to improve. I'm tempted to put together a handbook for her, or any other aspiring news editor. Typical problems, yes: standardization issues, unnecessary optimism.  First thing this morning: I called someone by his dead brother's name. Not to his face, of course. I just feel so icky inside. But there's hope.  There is no feeling like falling in love, provided that you don't do it very often.  Just when i think I have it hard, I know C has it worse. More piano competitions, tutoring, just earning any sort of money for college. And AP classes. So I can't complain. A new Chopin ballade today. A-flat major. So now Bach, Ravel, Schumann concerto, and Chopin. I have work to do.  Stepped out of the shower and realized that I have physio studying to do too. I hate people mooching, I just can't help it. Especially when I don't know them except in the context that they keep on asking me questions about homework. 90% of the time Mark IMs you it's for the Spanish homework, as if it weren't written on the whiteboard every day in class. Then he asks me for physio answers just now. I say I don't really have them. How are you going to do the test? he asks. I just haven't checked them yet, I reply. And then Heather asks too. Mind you, I'm not an anal person. I just think it's kind of unreasonable, perhaps? that people just ask me for answers and favors without a) being apologetic about it (hey, sorry for bothering you, I'll help you out sometime too) or b) ever returning the favor. I think Heather and Mark only did Excelsior in terms of doing a favor for Lydia, and even then it was on a completely voluntary basis.  People have no shame, no propriety, no sense of self-worth. No character. Potty mouth me: moochers can just go to hell, it's not like they're getting into a good college anyways. And for the cheaters like H and J and other lowly folk, screw you all, seriously. I hope your miserable life reflects your miserable lack of good character. How in the world do I, working for every grade I earn and feeling damn good about it, stay in the same class as someone who's as weak and stupid as to just copy answers and scrape by? When we no longer have to hunt and scavenge for food, survival of the fittest means the survival of the most intelligent. I just hope those idiots live out a mediocre life at best, not able to enjoy the best things in life: hard work, self-fulfillment, self-truth. Being able to know that every part of you is yours, knowing that you're whole. I'm surprised they haven't killed themselves yet because they feel their life is so pointless, that they're such weak characters. I certainly would to save the world a hell of a lot of trouble.   FRIENDSHIPS ARE RECIPROCAL, stupid. Fuck it, I'm not going to give you more answers when you are of absolutely no use to me. Why do I care for your welfare, when you can just go off to some other answer slut and get it? Losers, the whole lot. I don't give a damn about what you take for the SATs, what classes you should take, what the answers to the physio packet are when it concerns you.  ARGH.  No more swearing. If you're reading this, I wouldn't worry about anything I ranted about. You know you don't do it. I hate too many people. But with that, I know who my friends are.  Let's go play with text boxes. And waste time when I could be memorizing physio notes.

      I'm shivering. It's cold, and it's not.  But I'm still smiling. Looking at Nigel's twisted clip art, the man and the seal. And smiling. You only know what's better when you've had something less.  am i doing this just so it'll never happen? we dream too hard, so the lovely, feathery figments of our imagination are so overtrodden that they cease to exist in their previous desirable forms. Charlie's right, we shouldn't think too much about things. The more we do, the worse they get, and everything ceases to be spontaneous, to be beter than dreams. Bret and the red car that didn't need to exist.

      Can't stop laughing. Everything past Saturday is all good. Lists. Decisions. Homework, maybe--sooner or later. See, this is why you don't want to go to sleep.  Arrr, but April also means birthday shopping too. Having an April birthday makes you ever conscious about everyone else who also has an April birthday. There's Tiff and Erum and Anna and Austin and Uncle Garlan, and I'm sure I've forgotten someone. Uncle is great, lol. He promised me anything, but I'm mostly sure it was a joke. Mom brings up that I've been bugging her about a car, but that's a joke too. Mm, maybe. I'm not that spoiled, and I'd just feel bad with anything outrageously expensive and new. Need to get something by Thursday. Am I busy this week? No, just journalism, maybe. And I realized that I do have another week to sign myself out of the hospital. Good. And it then follows that it's another night with Parshaw and Co., and diapers and cafeteria food and just laughing way too hard.  My writing's slipping. Austin's playing weird synth music (after a long Usher run) in the background. Disturbingly atonal. I should sit down and breathe and just think normally for once, but that's beyond me for now. Hah, I still have that legal pad stuffed between the cushions, and someday Mom's going to come across it and read it. But I've left my scribblings lying around before anyways. I wonder how much she knows. She certainly doesn't show it, but she is a person of extreme moods.  I should sober up. School is on the horizon. 7am English, lovely. And all of a sudden, I think Doupe's mom and the cats...

      Mi dia era un serie de heridas pequenas.  Well, not that bad. It's just that I'm bracing from being yelled at by mom as I drove off the freeway, at having to do two SATII math packets, at having a brainache while sorting through the 20-odd problems i missed.  But otherwise, I guess it couldn't be that bad--after all, it's a lazy Sunday, I've eaten already and I don't have anything ugly hanging over my head except maybe a possible journalism deadline tomorrow. And piano lesson.  Lauren: i'm trying to choose between mit, harvard and stanford  Oh man, the things we do. Haha, I almost wish I'd played some obscure instrument like the bassoon now. Which makes me wonder: a year from now, will I be bitter that Harvard didn't send me a thick envelope, like Sylvia? Or will I be fortunate enough to choose between three academic powerhouses? I don't get it, either. Sylvia is just the neatest, most down-to-earth person in the world. She's not that kind of rigid geek who can't even carry on a normal conversation. She, Andrew and I have had some silly ones that one day before the choir concert in orchestra. She gets a 1600, does ballet, orchestra, clubs...if anything, she's one of the people I try to mimic. But I'm overjoyed for Lauren, too. Haha, what a difficult choice she has now! This time next year I want to be beaming for myself. We'll see how that goes. Am I worth it? Am I good enough?  Sometimes I really have to wonder: why should I be accepted into Harvard over other students? Hm. I have competitively good grades. My SAT score needs minor adjustment, but it's not that far from perfect. I have yet to try my hand at the SATII's, but I think writing and lit should be ok. Math IIC is very, very questionable at this point, but maybe it's just like the way it was on SATI math, it just needs practice. I'll be editor-in-chief of the paper by next year, and that's four years of journalism. If Julia and Harrison are still coaching next year or if an overwhelming majority of my friends are doing it again, that's four years of MT, three as an attorney. AA and NHS, hopefully. Earth club, adopt a beaches, etc. Excelsior. Maybe 200 hours at the hospital before graduation. First violinist. UC Davis research, Harvard summer school. Golf, even though I hate it. But am I too much like Sabrina Chou? Haha, what if we both apply to Harvard early and they decide, well, Sabrina's two sisters have come through here, I think Sabrina's a better choice over Lydia.  I am too typical.  I just want so badly to make it big, though. It sounds so B-list starlet of me. More later, I think Abdul's coming to LA.

      A circle of happiness.   Did another walk up the driveway. This time, it was a full moon and I could feel the gravel under my feet and hear Nige, Tiff and Chaddy and Andrew drive off. I don't know why it's so fantastic, it's just this feeling...I can't help but feel every day that I love the people I'm with. It's nice to know that I'm a normal human being now, that I have people I can feel at home with. And it was an excellent way to erase the memory of a busy, busy week. Oh man, they are just fantastic.  And I just opened my inbox: I made Bach.   Driving lesson with Jimmy. It definitely shattered a lot of my stereotypes of black people. He just talked and talked for the whole entire two hours, and I don't think I can count how many times he said, "Stupid girl." Not about me, but about this girl he talked to on the phone last night who had psychological issues. He was just unexpectedly open, just talking and talking about life and girls and how they're superficial and needy and emotionally ill. Definitely not as strict as Sarah, who yaps at me for silly things. Little things, I mean.  Properly sated.

      My first thought this morning: it's 10 days until my birthday and I just regret that I didn't get that driving permit earlier. But hey, I turn 16 in 10 days. Woo hoo. Sigh. A perfect day would just be going to Third Street and Santa Monica, etc. with friends but I really don't know how possible that will be. And if I can move on in Bach, will regionals be that weekend?  But self-anger aside, today's a perfect fit day. One thing after another, and little boredom time in between, which is probably healthy since I don't wish to lounge around for hours waiting for a phone call tonight. I have a driving lesson in 15 minutes. New instructor. I wonder if he'll be as strict as Sarah ("You're 3 mi over the speed limit!") or if he'll be less stringent. At any rate, it's a practice driving test today. I'm kind of mad that I haven't gone on the freeway since my last lesson, but Dad, apparently, is too busy to take me. And then at 8 my house is going to be overrun by the six members of our English class group. Fun fun. I have to clean up this desk before they come, though. It's strewn with a whole bunch of college mail that I really don't need, and I've been meaning to clean it up anyways. And maybe I should put better pictures up...maybe.   It's going to be a good weekend, says Lydia. Bach was just the beginning. Well, it was a big beginning--and here I start sounding like Pegleg's Jersey Girl review.  Postal Service: Brand New Colony.

      Fatigued, but in the best way. I came home from journalism half an hour ago, had dinner and here I am now. Sore, but a mental kind of sore.  Leni Fe's done, Bach tomorrow. And driving lesson. I've started forgetting dates and relative time, it's pretty pathetic.  It's been a long week. I'm surprised I made it this far.

      I just read a bit of a blog that looked just as mine did, and somehow I'm happy. She was a solid writer too. Anecdotal, like me. Perhaps not so emotionally driven or frustrated. More reverent, carefree about things. There is hope in this world after all.  I've skipped my nap for today too, though I don't know how I'm going to make it through two hours of orchestra tonight. But I do get to talk to Sylvia, perhaps, and ask her if she really got into Stanford. I'm so happy for her, she deserves it every bit of the way though I don't know why Harvard didn't take her. I want to be like her in so many ways--actually, is that habit healthy? But I need people to look up to, to prod me into shape.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, I like Sylvia's foil (thanks for the word, Peter) less and less. Well, it'll never be hatred, no. But just remembering Hollywood Knights and her running around and just taking pictures and schmoozing with the "stars" while people like Anna were honestly diligent, and today when she was just looking over my shoulder in journalism at all the pictures she took at HK that night...they were all yellow in the dim of the gymnasium, too. But she wholly deserves what's coming: to get that kind of PSAT score, etc. and then just to decide to go where she's going. Well, I won't judge. I'm sure people think I am horrid too.  So it's a little after 4 and I have my Fe Bland Foundation application sitting to my right. I'm going to have to fill it out to night, as unpleasant as it may be, since I'm going to send it out tomorrow. And funnily, I don't think the application's what's bothering me now, it's going over the CD and the recorded clips again and making sure everything sounds at least passable. More than passable, I hope, I really do. Piano is probably the greatest, most persistent factor in my life that's kept me humble since I'm so apt to screw up in that area. I realize I've become more apathetic lately--Bach Festival is Saturday and I've pretty much prevented it from bothering me--but I don't want to fail. I know Wendy's right and that it's probably better to submit it knowing that you're going to make it and getting pleasantly surprised in mid-May, but I still want to put up a fight. Oh, well, the first page isn't that bad. I'll just take it step by step.  Mmmm, I got a B- on my Spanish test. I laugh now, but I don't know what happened. There's TEN rules of subjunctive? And in some cases I was simply too retarded to realize that the previous verb was in future, not conditional tense. Having missed nine on the grammar side, I'm going to go in at lunch next Wed. to learn it again. With half of the 4AP students, hah.  Oh man, tomorrow's Friday. And I have to stay after for journalism since it's the second to last day to work. As usual, I've procrastinated on the front page, and I have nothing set up right now. I wish they'd pass out locks so I could get a secondary picture to go with the one Austin is going to take tomorrow (this morning's plan evaporated after I couldn't find batteries and ended up blurting an expletive, to Mom's dismay). We've never tried a lead story with two pictures, and I think it'd be perfect for this one since Holmboe is so reluctant to give out information, anyways. But knowing school bureaucracy, I doubt we'll be lucky enough to catch any action by Monday, at the latest. I really wish I could talk to a professional journalist about front page layouts because mine turn out the same every time and I don't know if I should feel guilty: four-column, column on the left, lead story with horizontal rectangular picture, a secondary story. From what little glances I get, the LA Times seems to stay on pretty much one layout too, but I'd still like confer with someone and see if the static layout is ok.   And sometimes I feel like I'm letting Battaglia down too. Hands down, she's my favorite teacher. Actually, I like Novak and Freeman too, but they don't let me go through their Girl Scout cookies and candy, lol. Let's just say this: I used to be dependable. Now? I've gotten tired. I'll say again for this April issue that I'd still like to go through and do some copy editing, but it doesn't look like it's going to work. Dorothy's doing her first news page, though, so I hope she learns to get a feel for it herself. Mm, no offense but the center spread seems like it's too texty and prosaic. Pegleg won't stop telling me "EYES ON YOUR OWN SCREEN!" Amanda's page is cute with the curtains. Ah, but I am anal. Selfishly, I think: how much better would it be if I could go through every page and fix anything and everything that bothered me? But I can't. I already have a reputation for being an ogre, lol, and that USC copy editing workshop didn't help.  I must go, I dally too much. I hope I can credit invisible mode for a decent amount of time saved tonight.

      I have Death Cab's "Title and Registration" playing on repeat in the car. The only reason it's not loud is that I don't want to startle myself at 6:40 am tomorrow morning when I drive to school.  It's so relevant.  I got another email today. A long one, surprise. Tears again, I have to stop being so awfully weak. Well, I didn't expect him to capitulate so soon, he's the man in the conversation. I was going to email him back, "You suck. You weren't supposed to give in, but now that you've screwed up my strategy I'll have to go back and think. More later." He says we've both changed. I believe him, but I'm not ready to start imagining how he's transformed. It's just not right. I was always the one who seemed like I wanted him more, and here he is asking for friendship. What is up with that?   I have to think carefully before I write him back. The last thing I want is to start something again and not know it.

      It's a Monday afternoon masquerading as a Sunday. I've just come home from lunch with the relatives. I check my email, thinking it'll just contain the usual stuff, not worth much reading. And then I get this message from none other:  "'I'd rather be myself,' he said. 'Myself and nasty. Not somebody else, however jolly.'" -Brave New World  if you don't like it, tough  Here I smile. Am I supposed to analyze this? I am tempted to write back, Oh, but you are nasty. And end it at that.   Well, I'm in the mood for overanalysis. Humor me. Or don't read it, I don't mind. Really.  So I tell him he's cold and heartless, a la Meursault. I tell him Meursault is going to be executed. I think this is what he copy-pasted back to me, from Jane Eyre:  Jane feels the need to belong somewhere, to find “kin,” or at least “kindred spirits.” This desire tempers her equally intense need for autonomy and freedom.  Actually, thinking about it, that's not too far from the truth. I congratulate him, that was an accurate quote.  Ah, so what do I do now? I could capitulate, and tell him that I was joking and I took it too far, but Meursault really did remind me of him. I could not talk to him ever again. Or I could send something caustic back in his direction. Oh, what a dorky little argument this is. Based on literature, of all things.  What a way to spend a Monday afternoon.

      I think I've angered him. I think back and laugh now, and he did very much so remind me of Meursault with his complete apathy and fearlessness of death. I told him so. He sparknoted it and launched a Jane Eyre sparknote back at me, something about wanting to fit in and finding a place. I wish I still had that quote, I'd laugh even harder. So that's what he thinks of me!  But he did bail me out at 2am. What a way to repay, Lydia.   I can't think of any other way to approach him than with cynicism. It's not the first time that I've initiated a friendly conversation with him and then turned edgy for no particular, distinguishable reason.  Well, at least I'm moving on to Faulkner. I opened Light In August and some pages tumbled out at me. What a sign.  And then I went to practice some. I think the prelude has new life, but the fugue just still sounds so elementary. But people like it? Or so I guess. Ah, but the Ravel. I can hear Mr. Francis singing in the background and waving his arms for dramatic effect. I can hear Nancy Bricard clapping and entreating me to pick up the tempo. It's really scary, but I like my ghosts around when I practice. I couldn't get much done with Ravel, though. It's the sloppiness issue still; there's just too many notes in too many awkward positions. I'll have to get up early to warm up tomorrow. No, I'll practice in earnest. I have a lesson at 11:15.  What else can I do tomorrow? SATII studying, but that doesn't sound attractive. Dad's going to be home, I just remembered.  I don't know if I should go on that AA field trip. I know Bruckner moved the video a day back just because of me (originally, the trip sounded so much more attractive because I'd miss the taping), and I don't know if it's even nice to show up Tuesday and tell her that I've changed my mind and that I'm going to show up on Wednesday. Who's going, I don't know. But not Nige, and not Nimo. Part of me wants to stick it out just because and see how I'll feel next year but then the other part asks myself why I want to go through that awkwardness. And I wouldn't want to miss the last day for the journalism seniors if we're not having dinner. We should. I'll talk to Mrs. Battaglia.

      And I'm back.  Got Faulkner. And Camus. And a new pair of jeans.  The last item bothers me a bit. (secretly laughs to herself) I knew a lecture was pending. I don't know how to justify it to another person, though. They fit well. I had a gift card.  Maybe I'll just sit back and read Faulkner and wait for it to cool over.

      Hah, I think I might have $10 in library fines. There's nothing as humiliating on a Saturday morning knowning that you might have to spend that kind of money to repay for your stupidity.  It's going to be a good day today, I hope. Piano practice, then lesson, then library to return that renegade SATII lit book (didn't help really, you see) then the mall. By myself, yay. I hope I find Faulkner today. Or just good reads in general.  My room is a mess, and I have no intention of cleaning it up. Someone keeps on cleaning up downstairs for me, so I guess I'll just stay and work here.

      Goodbye, shuteye.  Well, both printers downstairs ran out of ink simultaneously, and Nigel and I both ran out of ink simultaneously, so Ryan's printing now. For both of us. I have to make up a math test at 6:10 am. It's going to be a long night, folks.  It's humbling myself to talk to him again. And it's almost frustrating since it takes a long time for him to respond and I'd much rather go to bed. Whatever, I had it coming. I hope this lack of sleep isn't going to affect testing. It's hard to tell what's going on in Ryan's computer.

      I'm afraid to play Weezer again since Maroon 5's Sweetest Goodbye is next on the CD player and it's running through my head right now.  I think I've seen a glimmer of home--anatomy won't be so terrible next year. Everything I just associate with it is so warm and fuzzy right now: I love Jean to bits, hands down. Bret reminded me what a miserable year I was going to have next year. Select adventures with a bottle of Sprite and very bearable anatomy comrades. Perhaps I owe it to being able to drive, but life isn't bad at all.  My lips are all red from being sick and my nose is raw from all the rubbing. Lovely.   I think we're going to have a journalism dinner, which is reassuring since I think I'm going with AA to bring the cadavers back to Loma Linda on Wednesday, which happens to be the journalism seniors' last day. I think this class was the one group I really got along with, and it's sad to see them leave. I guess the higher you go up in grade level, the more you miss your seniors. A dinner would be perfect fun, and a good way to say goodbye.  And mock trial dinner too, for sure.   I can't believe all this is winding down. I fear extreme movement right now, it's funny. As if my light gestures could keep this kind of nostalgic rinse on me forever.

      Lydia's adventures on the road.  Well, we can start by saying that we "put the paper to bed," as Mrs. Freeman would call it. It's done, and it makes me kind of sad since it's the last issue with all the people I love so much in journalism. Next issue, we'll have some new blood, and it's scary to think that I'll be the editor-in-chief. Am I ready? I don't know, it's a lot of work perfecting the thing, but I'm so glad Battaglia's there. She's honestly my second mom, and the only adult I really trust outside of my family. I've told her about Mom and Dad's tyranny campaigns, guys, life...  Then I had lunch with Jess. She originally said she'd come in to help proof and stuff, but we were done by the end of seventh period so we just kind of hung out with Pegleg and Brandon and Keira until we really could tape the box shut. And then we went to La Salsa in the Promenade, since I was craving a Baja burrito but figured it would be more convenient in the Promenade. We visited Brighton for keychains, hah. There's a really neat one, leather, that's a rose and when you open it up it's a heart-shaped frame and a mirror opposite. The catch is, it's $38 and I can't bear to part with almost $40 for the sake of a keychain. Granted, it's going to follow me everywhere my keys go (whose picture would I put in the frame? that's a weird question too) but for the same price, I could get a tank of gas. I could get a pair of Converse sneakers. I could get a very decent shirt. I could have lunch a couple of times.  Well, Bowman brought up today that there's this job open in a doctor's office, and they're taking two anatomy students. One does lab work i.e. taking out stitches and staples while the other's the receptionist. I think Jean's the receptionist now, I've seen her in scrubs once. It pays $8/hour. I guess that's not bad, since it's constant work, but it's not much. I hope it starts when school does, since I really want it (the doctor apparently wants smart and friendly people, so I hope that eliminates some of the competition) and if it starts during the summer I probably won't get it. I think Nigel was eyeing it too.  So lunch. And a good talk with Jess, which was nice especially on a random Wednesday afternoon. I'm so happy I can drive now, it's such an awesome feeling just to go anywhere. Broke six months taking Jess to Long's just for the heck of it. Didn't find the giant pack of Halls vitamin C drops, so didn't buy anything. Came home, went into the garage and saw that Mom wasn't home so I decided to return Angela's Ashes to the library. Driving out, I didn't know if it was worth it: it was 20 miles round trip, more gas, maybe traffic, all for a book that was overdue, but I did it anyways. Getting off at the Janss exit, this lady tried to cut in front of me. She had her blinkers on, yes, and I was approaching at 60-ish, but she had them on for such a long time that I thought she wasn't going to come out. Well, she started changing into my lane, but by then I was close. I put on the brakes. I made a screeching noise. The woman, whose license plate was (heart)2 WRTE (she followed me to the library too), retreated. I whispered sorry to the wheels, but it came out as a croak; my throat was dry. I thought, wow, that was stupid of her. And then I thought, did I do that too? I guess I understand why people get pissed.  But I don't like being honked at. Even though I'm not the most competent driver yet (hey, it's day 3) it stings to hear the beep even though any time you hear it you expect it's directed at you. After you hear that honk, you're slightly wounded, I guess. Not so much embarrassed, since the people around you don't know who you are, but just ashamed of yourself. I don't like honking myself, either.  Random phrase popped into my head: "...died and gone to Heaven."  I'm happy. I just have to get this homework done, fun fun.

      I PASSED. Oh gee by golly whiz, etc. I did.  Except now I'm so hoarse from a sore throat and a cough that I can barely talk.  It feels so good, though. I have the keys in my pocket and I'm going to take my first independent trip in a few minutes--to Mr. Francis's house, no less. I don't think the implications have hit me yet, but it's so much more freedom for me. I know Mom and Dad will place restrictions, but what the hell, I won't test them quite yet. It's just so awesome. I almost thought I wasn't going to pass, too, since I kind of stopped at a stop sign and then I officially stopped somewhere in front of the limit line, but it was all right.  And for once, I'm not hungry. I guess being sick gets to you that way.  So yeah, no more bumming rides, though I still owe people (namely Jess). A little more sense of self-worth. Oh, it's a sweet victory; I've been waiting for this for ages.   If only I could get rid of this nasty cold.

      Robitussin doesn't work, Ricolas don't work and this Chinese stuff doesn't work either so I think I'll just sit here and cough it all up. I have a sore spot at the back of my tongue where the cough drops have somehow mutilated it, maybe from too much sugar, like when your lips shrivel up from having too many salty fries.  Not nervous about driving tomorrow. Just hope traffic is good and the signs are auspicious.   I need a drink. I really really do.

      Hopefully as I become a more mature person I learn to handle things that won't go my way.  I wanted to stay over at Relay last night, but Dad wouldn't allow it. Only now do I see his reasoning and only now do I appreciate that I only stayed until 12am, since what fun is it when you're half dead from fatigue? It was a gem. I enjoyed it, to say the very least.  So I'm going to squander away another afternoon for the choir concert. We're supposed to check in with "Moriah or Mari," and I automatically know who I'm going to report to, hah. I'll bring hw and Rain of Gold, which is actually pretty good. Typical Latin American kind of literature, in the storytelling style, full of strong emotion.  Road test tomorrow, yay.

      Saturday morning.  I have the makings of a cold, I guess, but I shan't complain. I went out to get gas with Grandma, and I guess I really need more practice before the real thing. Drove to the post office. Saw a double-decker red bus on the way home.  Orchestra mall thing in the afternoon. I WILL PLAY SOFTLY, hah.  I don't know what to do with the rest of the afternoon. I told myself I'd wake up and practice SATIIC math, but I felt shitty so I decided not to.  Oh, and I had a bizarre dream. I went to Harvard summer school, but for some reason I had to come back for a week or two, and a whole bunch of weird stuff went on i.e. some sort of Disney-like hotel called the Empress, prep school guys in rooms, 10pm curfew, closing the gates on you, wandering on the streets in daylight. I guess the ultimate conflict was whether or not I should go back because by then I'd already missed a few weeks, but I wanted to stay home for my driving test. I tried to go online to talk to people to get advice...  I think about going online too much. I'm online too much. Yesterday going through pages I swore I saw orange rectangles flashing at the bottom of the screen even though it was on an iMac with no possibility of getting AIM. And then after dinner I closed my eyes and the first thing I saw was that yellow man.  But journalism's going well this issue, I think...at least for me. I'm done with my pages as much as I can do, though the valedictorian story opening is what Sylvia told me not to do so I better check with her this afternoon...or tomorrow sounds better, hah. I need baccalaureate details, and then I'm all finished. So I've started to tinker with other pages, which is the best thing in the world. I need to rearrange the juniors to look out for page. I wish I had some magazines to flip through for ideas.  I should practice orchestra pieces, hah. Well, it's star-spangled, valkyries, chicago, pirates...wait, that's not much at all. Oh, lord of the rings. That's still not much.

      In a fragile mood.  If anything, it's my adventures in music that humble me. A bad piano day is enough to put me into major introspective mood and make me practice more. And orchestra. Oh God. I thought it was getting better but there are moments when you just want to shrink inwardly and implode. I can see it in playing in primitive cinematic effects: one shot shows Lydia playing, sitting on a chair. The next shot shows a poof of smoke and a Cal sweatshirt on the chair.  During Homeland:  Mariah: "Play softer and over the fingerboard. You're the loudest one in the section."  I've analyzed this in my head already. First of all, it's bad since I couldn't hear myself playing, and there's this certain sense of erroneous self-righteousness in playing loud when everyone's soft. Then I have this notion that I'm a horrible player and I don't deserve my chair, and playing horribly and loudly all at once compounds my guilt. And then I need someone to tell me how to play softly. Second, I've made a spectacle of myself. Hank keeps on asking me, first in English and then in Spanish, what she said. I then proceed to think that the crafty critter already knows what she said but wants to make me say it myself to rub salt in the wound. He won't stop asking. Then I wonder if Sean heard it. If he did, that's another nail in the coffin. There's also the risk of her alerting Mr. Benson, or anyone. And finally, it's Mariah (I'm spelling her name wrong on purpose). I haven't liked her ever since the day she was passing out papers and she was right around my stand and I didn't play full volume. She gave me a look, and my memory tells me she said something like, "What, you can't play when I'm around?" And then I asked for Homeland music last week and she in turn questioned, "Second violin?" "No, first," I said. She knows it, too. And then today. I'm fully aware that I'm pathologically hypersensitive, but this kind of discrimination (hatred is too strong, but along those lines) is particularly bothersome since it's indirect. Fine, so if you hate me, tell me right out. And if you don't, don't do anything. But it's hatred by insinuation, and that's what bugs me.  So I, in short, feel like shit.   I almost feel like that group of medieval people that flogged themselves for their sins. What were they called? Something with "flagellate" in the name, since I thought of bacteria when I read about them. But whenever I encounter a situation like this, I become masochistic. In my shame, I seriously wouldn't mind if someone took a knife and slashed me to rid me of my guilt, though I wouldn't take the knife to myself. Instead, I pinch myself or something, just anything to incite physical pain to equal what's inside. Well, I have a sore throat. And maybe staying after school for journalism is also some kind of weird penance. I need to stay. My column might not go in or something like that. I don't know. I thought Bret was joking when he told me that, but what's worse than Bret teasing you is when Bret's serious and won't give.  I think it's lame to sulk. But I'm not going to run around laughing, etc. I'm just embarrased, and overly so, I know, but that's my way of dealing with it.

      I need to get a grip and remember what's really important.   Besides being chased by random people who want to kill you and know exactly where you are, plus playing piano competitively, my next ugliest feeling is doing something, but knowing that there's going to be something weird about it. Like going out to lunch after APs that one time. And going to the mall tonight. In Angela's Ashes, Angela talks constantly about being in Limbo, and maybe that aptly describes it. Almost there, but not. Hanging, and you don't know if it's the right thing to do. It's not going to work out.   And no spoons tonight. Hah.  My favorite question is "Are you happy?" I was tempted to ask Dad tonight. I also wish I could go upstairs and say sorry to Mom.  Huevos rancheros and Maya Angelou. I've tried Maya, but not huevos yet. I'm not hungry.

      I'm full. And not regretting it yet. Have to go make flan for Spanish and cupcakes for Greg and Keira and Amanda.  Sylvia walked up to me in the social science hallway today and tells me the news: she's talked to Peter, and Chika and Peter are going to prom together. I can only laugh, until Sophie mutters something about a "stalker." Not that it matters, I'm sufficiently amused already.  But somehow this prom thing scares me in the way it's wrecking people, and it makes me sad. Parshaw thinks weird things are going on with his date and it's not the same anymore. Scott thinks the same thing. And Dorothy whispers in my ear that her friend is dating Keira's date, and that he regrets asking her in the first place. Meanwhile, Keira is asking Coral how people tell when it's a relationship. I know she didn't see him at the volleyball game that night when she was supposed to. I look through last year's yearbook at Dorothy's friend, a sophomore, and Keira's date, a senior. The girl looks so young, she still has braces and a juvenile look about her. Somehow I'm mad at the guy for his perfidy. Keira is such a good girl (for want of a better word) and deserves something, but maybe she's putting way too much into it. She wants to spend her birthday with him. Her profile says "baffled," and I hope that has nothing to do with her prom date but if it did, I wouldn't be too surprised either. I have an urge to tell her because I'm one for revealing secrets (ha ha), but then that would betray Dorothy's trust and it would hurt Keira. But what would be worse, knowing that your date doesn't want to go with you anymore or actually going and not having a good time? But this is all secondhand, too. It's just a lot of messing with emotions. I can see how girls, when asked by a guy, will make flying leaps of logic and suddenly think the guy likes her. Note to self: never, ever do that.  Thinking of suitable things to write, I marvel at how our lives are built around relationships, which involves communication. Mom and I aren't exactly on good terms right now because she was slow to tell me something and then I got extremely mad at her. Talking to certain people about the right things (always unknown until it happens) can make my day. When we talk, exchange looks, we can breed joy, jealousy, pain. And the more I realize it, I become increasingly thankful for the people around me who can just bring a smile to my face by just being there. Thanks, guys.  It's Greg's birthday tomorrow. And then Keira's. She's stubborn about not eating cake or anything before the real thing, but she's going to be making up a statistics AP that day, so if she has her way she gets no journalism cake. I'm sure Amanda, whose birthday is on Saturday, will be absolutely fine. I love them all, it's funny how their birthdays are three in a row. Chocolate or yellow cupcakes with chocolate mint frosting, just because Greg likes chocolate and I liked the weird frosting.  Abdul's going to Caltech. Yay!  I smell like body spray, but it sure beats the stench of mink preservative.

      Erm, maybe I was excessively pissed earlier. Doesn't mean I've given in, I'm still incorrigibly rude (if you ask Mom). Whatever. You'll see me again, and I'll be fine.  Day 1 of eating regularly, though I don't think it was particularly successful by the time I finished with dinner. Ate in the hospital cafeteria: no rice, but pork, fries and what didn't look like old peach pie. Also had an ice cream. So there, I've ruined it. I'm somewhat lighter, though not considerably. I wonder how long it's going to last, but really, I'm not that hungry right now so I shan't care.  I pulled out all the post-its in my Harper's today and I found an Emerson quote: "Ne te quoesiveris extra." Yay. I just need to be strong and get through everything that bothers me.   I'm going to go look for a poem, so I'm going to quit posting--not like I've written anything great today anyways.

      I've plumb forgotten what it feels like to be in love. (indistinguishable tugs at heart). It was a logical end to the whole situation, and wishing does no good.  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  I just made love with your sweet memory One thousand times in my head You said you loved it more than ever You said  You remain, turned away Turning further every day  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  I talked for hours to your wallet photograph And you just listened You laughed enchanted by my intellect Or maybe you didn't  You remain, turned away Turning further every day  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  You remain, turned away Turning further every day  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared And in your place an empty space has filled the void behind my face  Do you believe what I sing now? Do you believe what I sing now? Do you belie-eve?

      I really need to stop eating. I can't imagine hitting that one mark that I'd promised myself I'd never do, so I'll seriously have to start rationing and eat three meals a day: BREAKFAST: a banana, maybe. Or yogurt. LUNCH: peanut butter and jelly, and crackers if I'm going to splurge DINNER: I can't really control this, but I'll cut down on the rice, half a bowl. Perhaps the key is eating only a little in between.  Don't dwell on this too much. Sometimes I hear other people talk about weight and I think they're insane, so I assume you must think I'm crazy too. It's just that studying's over and I'm still eating and eating and eating. It's a bad habit.   I should be playing piano right now, but I don't feel like it. I just got out of the shower and nothing feels like moving right now, not even the fingers that are doing the typing. I just feel like such a pig, and I didn't even have that much today. Argh. Maybe it was the Cinnamon Toast Crunch last night.  I guess I'm in a faintly negative mood. I went to school feeling grubby, but then I realized it was really ok, but the damage was done by then. The seniors put on their caps and gowns for the front page picture today, and it was sad: once they all left for the picture, it was only Dorothy and me left in the back row. I forgot to bring a water bottle today, which set me off for some reason. I thought of how many times I've been spited in recent history after I showered.  I finished the column, but I'm not proud of it. I lost momentum.  There's a week until the license and 18 days of school left.  On Saturday I thought of how neat it would be if we could just wander around Santa Barbara. It's that wonderful town-by-the-sea feeling. I think of pastels and old wood when I imagine it. So that makes three places I want to visit after school's out and before Harvard. No, four. Santa Barbara, Ventura, Malibu and Disneyland.   We're starting mink dissection tomorrow. I have to find an old shirt.  I wonder if Mom's really going to take me shopping tomorrow or if she's going to tell me tomorrow afternoon that she has to pick up Austin and that it won't work, so I'll end up going to Los Robles a sullen, spoiled kid. But I got mad at her for picking me up late today. Who wouldn't, when school lets out at 2:45 and she comes at 2:58? So I couldn't really broach the topic. Whatever, I don't really need to go, but it would be nice to.  My contacts are getting dry.   I hate off-season tennis. Eighteen days.  Oh, but more than a month until Harvard. Ack.

I still have to finish simplex. I know I haven't been the greatest math partner to Shalra. And then physio meeting at 8.  ...and other adventures.

      On my way out when I realized that hey, I had an interesting day.  All I can say is that around other people, Chika is so social that I can only resign and stand there and smile. It's so funny, she's already invited at least four people to go shopping with her. She's somehow convinced Mr. Francis to have a cooking party at his house for his high school students. She's invited Joe Peeples to The Habit. When she finally rolls up the window (we're in the drive-thru line at In-N-Out and we see them after showcase)I ask her how she knows Joe and she giggles. "I don't," she says. She talks about Ken (and giggles) and prom dates. She tells everyone at Colburn that they did well, and they yell "You did too!" back. I just stand there, smiling. I feel like such a wallflower.  I know I'm antisocial, but today just brought it out in me. There's no way I can keep up with the vivacity of a person like Chika, who is a pathological giggler. She's nice to be around anyways, though. It's someone to stick around, along with Wendy. It's just the way I am, I suppose. I don't talk to people unless I know them well, which probably takes a lot of patience since I'm in no mood to expose my inner feelings usually. Really, I'm all right with that regularly. But maybe just not today.   I swear, after every dinner at Mandarin Wok there's that icky feeling in your mouth. I even skipped the fortune cookie today (but I opened it, and the slip said, "Soon you will be sitting on top of the world").  Will I? I'm ready.  I need to order plane tickets.

      On the verge of dinner. I have music on loud, and somehow it scares me even though it's still light outside. Crazy day, but maybe satisfying. I won't ever do it again, though.  It's a Saturday night and nobody's home. Good.

      I wonder if the parents or anything think blogging looks like homework. Granted, the title of this thing is stretched across the top of the post page, and it doesn't exactly look like word processing to me either, but it works.  Whatever.  Edginess has never been my forte, but I have to admit it's amusing. It goes back to Jean's (and here I almost spell it "gene," as if I were still hooked on bio) theory about deception and using it to your advantage. I'm not being nice, no.  It's a funny pre-performance routine. I'll go online for a break in practicing, end up talking to someone and realize it's too late to go back and play once I'm done. At least it's consistent.

      Recovering from a bad dream, and listening to "Across the Sea." I love it.  Nobody's on, they're all at Troy or something. I guess I'm ok with that, I wasn't fanatical about the movie anyways and I'm supposed to stay home to practice tonight. I just needed to talk to someone to erase that horrible feeling. I'm actually dressed in something un-pajama-like; relatives are over and I was told to get dressed for dinner.  So the dream went something like this: Austin picked up a phone call for me and pretended to be Lydia. He said a whole bunch of crap, and then someone called me teling me that Jess was mad because I said something horrible to her. I didn't know what she was talking about. I go back to school and everyone accuses me of being homosexual (?) and of cheating and of being a generally bad person for not showing up to anatomy physicals tomorrow. Something like 42 million people turn against me, and the only friends I have left at school are my counselor and Mrs. Battaglia. I cry and cry and cry, and all the while the soundtrack to Gone with the Wind is playing. Cut to a scene from Anatomy: people are getting ready for physicals day. Somehow Charlie's there too. We work through the night and in the morning we're still there, ready to go to the hospital. Bowman has a trailer called the "Expensive Vehicle"--It's written on a license plate, though now I realize it couldn't fit. Another scene shows Austin, Grandma and me at the curbside of one of the houses in this community and we're eating their discarded food. The matron of the house turns into her driveway in a red sedan (I remember she's blonde) and gives us a menacing stare, but nothing more. And then both Mom and Grandma pop their heads in the door and tell me to get ready for dinner by 7:30. PM. I thought it was morning already.  This just goes to show you how much of dreams are picked from snippets of everyday life. The homosexual comment was from a conversation with Wendy last night:  Me: I have a habit of liking people too easily Wendy: Really? I never noticed Me: yeah, it's bad Wendy: Well, it's ok. Otherwise I would have thought you were homosexual. j/k  Something like that.  Cheating comes from my general hatred of cheaters. Anatomy physicals day is tomorrow. I'm vaguely afraid of Jess's sensitivity and try not to irritate it. I probably have 42 mil in my head from Earth Club facts today. I was told Bowman's daughter Shelby was adopted today. I saw Charlie in Earth Club, he's started wearing a hat. Please don't, Charles. Eating was probably from a sign I saw at the gate about some community fiesta whose blueblood revelers will shame my parents in their social awkwardness.  That's another issue. We're studying racial writers in English, and there's a selection by Amy Tan called "Mother Tongue" in which her mom speaks bad English but is educated at the same time. I think of my own mother and her imperfect English. Yes, sometimes I'm a bit ashamed of it and I wish she wouldn't be so brusque or inarticulate, etc. Dad's simply quiet, I really have no problems there except the occasional badly-worded email. As someone who values communication so much, it annoys me particularly that my parents don't speak good English.  Wow, that wasn't particularly articulate.  It's going to be a slow Friday night, I know it. Fun.

      I really don't know what I've been doing these past few days. I've bummed online for 2 hours, 1 minute up to this moment. My back just did a lovely crack--it must be from all this slouching. I think there's an actual indentation in my flesh where I slouch. My back makes a lovely c-shaped curvature when I'm on the piano bench. People don't like it. I do, it's comfy. Too much effort sitting up straight anyways, wouldn't you agree?  My day: coming home, showering, some simplex, cereal, nap, dinner, orchestra, SAT scores and sitting down for 2 hours 1 minute and counting. I was getting milk for the Cinnamon Toast Crunch when I seriously wondered what I would be doing otherwise, if I did have something exigent to take care of. I shrugged it off. That's how apathetic I am. In fact, boredom headaches are common these days. The climax today was probably the SAT scores, which isn't even exciting at all.  Ellis is sending me music. Wonderful!  Anna couldn't stop talking about how Irene should have been secretary. Maybe she doesn't understand. NHS offices are determined by popular approval, not handwriting like 12pt Times. I can't pinpoint why I don't really get along with Irene--I used to. I don't know if it's change in me or change in her, but sadly I don't miss the friendship much. It's almost this unwillingness to change, remaining forever the hardcore student. It's almost a fobbishness, too, but I don't like to admit that. Nigel says you can totally tell if a person was born here or somewhere else. It's a certain awkwardness detectable in Barbara, in Irene, in Tyffany. I don't think there would have been enough support for Irene. I'm not the only one who thinks there's something not right.   But in pinpointing what I don't like about other people, I wonder what has changed in me. Like most other people, I couldn't even go back to freshman year and say I liked myself back then. I changed in some indistinguishable point sophomore year. Maybe it was mock trial. Or the trio. Or Tiff and Nige. Every year I get out of school and swear that these past ten months were the best ever. And maybe I'm being truthful. But I know I'm growing up. I like it, but I almost feel guilty saying that I'm having a good time as if teenage apathy and wishfulness were standard. But think about it: I'm surrounded by great people. School's actually holding up ok, I won't have to worry too much. I do the things that make me happy. I like what I see in the mirror...to a certain extent. I don't do major drama. I have peanut butter and jelly for lunch. Life is good.  I need sleep. Yawn.

      SAT scores are back. In my heart of hearts, I wish I had the mental presence to do better, but some I'll keep. What a crazy life this is.  Ellis is telling me a random story about undercooked fish and climbing mountains and goats. Hi Ellis.  Just had chili and cheese with chips. Awfully fattening, I know, but it's good. I haven't been able to stop eating lately, and it bothers me. It shows, too. The planned alternative was eating a bit at school, coming straight home and napping.  Just for Jess, I'm posting now.

      I didn't have the heart or the will to stay at the piano bench for even an hour, so I'm here again.  It's a comfortable life these days, just eating and lounging around and doing minimal homework, but then I wonder where this is getting me. Nowhere is the obvious answer, but I'm too ignorant to accept it.  My mind wanders when I play piano. I don't like the carpeting in the living room for the Bach (undeniably picky of me). I start playing Szymanowski and somehow the pedaling cuts the phrases apart and I think of Nick: in January, this was his song. And then somehow I start thinking of Adam Borelli's girlfriend from long ago: I think she was a 1600 who went to TO and came to Westlake to talk to some kids about Harvard. I remember her watching one of our trials one year and I couldn't help but marvel at the fact that she was both Chinese and sophisticated at the same time. Good Asian girls don't get boyfriends, usually. But some manage, I suppose. I was reading threads about prep school, and I thought of a term paper quote that begins like this:   "She can be seen imagining what might have become of her if..."  What if I went to prep school, or even Viewpoint? Would I wear skirts and interact with guys who have their collars turned up? In a twisted way, I think ha, they have higher admissions rates to colleges. But then again, what kind of life is that? In ways, I'm glad I don't go to an excessively high-powered school otherwise I'd be crushed.  Bah, college. What am I thinking? Lots.

      So I found the Brahms, after two days delay. He was right, it was in the second drawer (I assumed I still had it in the pile right next to the cabinet, but apparently someone did some cleaning). It's still slightly wrinkled from that puddle exposure that one day. I have markings in it for pedal, fingering, little notes to myself. He wants it back. It almost symbolizes everything we were, though. It has "TRIO" in big letters on both the official cover and the piano part cover.   Turning it in tomorrow will mean turning in the trio. I can't believe we played so much music. It was just one movement, but it's pages and pages. I have to admit, though: we weren't excellent. I remember hearing the Colburn trio play another Brahms and it was simply magnificent with the rich violin and cello vibrato.   It also means that after this, we don't have anything to talk about anymore.  I tried starting another column today, but I don't think it will float. Now that I said that, the chance of it actually going to print has diminished even more. I wish I knew what to write, though. That first one was magical, it filled in just the right space--it was original and it was something I could talk about. The new one is on wishes, inspired by a short conversation I had last night. An even older (and sloppier) one is on yearbooks. It's nothing to work with, though, and I can't let Bret down.  I feel like such an idiotic do-gooder in journalism, too. I stayed in for lunch until 12:30 to see what I could do about writing. Mrs. Novak came over to talk to Mrs. Battaglia about English curriculum stuff, and I almost felt embarrassed that I had no life and was instead staying in to do work. For some reason, I have always felt guilty asking for things not owed to me. I don't like to seem overly interested. Bragging is unhealthy. I wonder if this is any different than An's situation. She works hard, yes, but it seems like it consumes her. Needless to say, Brandon and Pegleg poke merciless fun.  It might sound paradoxical to you, but I feel there's something gritty and primitive about people who obsess over school, as if the people who magically balance social and academic lives have simply better adapted to the environment. It's in the way these hard-core academics look and dress, their conversations, their incessant drive for perfection. People (and I say this without particular scorn) like Anna Bekker and Irene almost seem like they just haven't grown up yet. So maturing, in a backwards kind of way, is discarding some of that perfectionist behavior. Growing up, and being imperfect. Should I just stop trying sometimes?  Then again, I can't talk.

      Meditative again.  I don't want to touch the valedictorian page. It always happens at around this time of year. I didn't play piano today. I had to borrow money from Keira, who took me out to lunch. I had a constant headache. And I was yawning all day long. I tutored, but only for a bit and I didn't know some of the stuff. Probability is old. But I still haven't mastered it.  Sin.   I am more than aware of my own weakness, so when I see others fall from grace it's sadness. And that when I'm cheated that some higher power manages to help me attain revenge. I try not to do anything that slights anyone. But it happens, I guess. And sometimes I'm the one who loses, too. And when it happens, I'm usually powerless to do anything in defense.   I can't declare myself religious in any way, but karma is often a comfort. Let the sinners suffer hell when everything accumulates upon them. It's the only way, really. We suffer from the constraints of societal opinion and personal moral weakness.   I find weak points. We are often unwilling to demolish idols, if I may, but allow me time to pass my own judgments.

      Nige, Nimo and Ryan Debbiny just left my house.  If anything, it's the spirit of summer. Or just spirit, period. I don't know what turns it on but it becomes a profound appreciation of the people you're with and just good times. I don't think I'll look at any of them again in the same way.   It's satisfaction. It's laughing and talking that just goes and goes and goes. I don't know how else to describe it.

      That's right, it never does end!  Piano was better than expected. I guess there's nothing like it to cheer me up, and that's the ironic thing. I usually associate piano with pain, stress, nerves, etc. But this is the plan for this weekend: I will have no Saturday whatsoever since it's Bach at 1 and then Colburn in the afternoon. Mr. Francis is like, "Oh, I'm going to both places so I could give you kids a ride...and maybe afterwards we can go out for pizza or somehting."  Chika, please tell me you're going too. :)  I remember Cynthia telling me she was the last of the old Francis students and how he used to take them to concerts. And that's all I can think of right now.   To complicate Saturday matters, it's Anatomy sports physicals day. If you're playing something next year, you can get your physical done at Los Robles Saturday morning. But hey, I'm more interested in staying home that morning to practice. I don't want to go.  So this is how you spell Szymanowski. Number three, of course.

      I tell myself it's finally over. And it is. No more APs for the rest of the year. So I can just sit back and relax. Get my license. Go somewhere.  But then I know it isn't. I have a piano lesson at 5:30, and then I'm tutoring. Tutoring tomorrow as well. I don't know why I do this to myself: it's all right, I suppose, since it's gas money, but I always get that "Oh no, not again" feeling right before I do it. And then when it's done and the money's in my pocket it doesn't feel so bad after all.   I'd like to take a nap, but I haven't practiced piano all week. Every Monday at around this time I plan what I'm going to play for lesson, but it's always a pathetic selection since I'm not diligent at practice. Bach, maybe. That's old. Beethoven's all right, but I need to finish figuring it out. And I want to take a nap. Sad thing is, I know if I fall asleep I won't wake up until I have to go.  It never ends.

      Hi. It's me again. I know it's been a while, and I also know this letter is better left unsent.  I thought of you just now. I was in bed thinking of old times and worrying about tomorrow's test at the same time when I had the sudden urge to call you. I knew you'd be up, and you might have your cell phone on. I didn't even remember your number anymore, it's been that long. I almost called your house by accident, but then I remembered your parents don't like disturbances.  Well, I called again, for one of those weakness chats that we haven't had in six months. And I got your message. I don't think you've changed it since last summer, when I could call you and hear it again and again and again.  I didn't say anything into the phone.  I know that if I talked to you you'd laugh at me for worrying, you'd quiz me incessantly and tell me that it'd be ok. You'd tell me about bio class and something to make me laugh. And we'd probably be talking past midnight, since that was the way our conversations used to go. And then all of a sudden we'd realize that so much time had passed and then we'd say bye. Or we couldn't say bye. You would end up hanging up because I always had so many verbal post scripts. And I would always feel slightly cheated since I'd start talking to nobody on the other line, but it would always be all right.   You know, you were the only one who could make me cry this inexplicable cry. It wasn't happiness or sadness but this silly wave of relief from reconciliation and having someone that made me cry. A few days later I'd return to my desk and find little cakes of salt. No more, though. For a while, I thought that was for the better.   I really don't expect you to ever talk to me again like we used to. That involved going through so many silly things together. I was always the emotional one; I can count several times when I was so distraught I had to call you up to stop crying. And every time I got off the phone I'd feel better, it was strange--you didn't know what I was going through and yet you managed to say all the right things. I was the one who sent you letters over the summer with no return, wanted to talk to you all the time. You can't imagine how happy I was when you told me about that first philosophy essay. But I called you back, and you were talking to someone else.  When I think of summer, I think of nights out on the balcony talking to you. I always wanted to be in Cambridge with you, what fun that would be. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I just thought too much and too wildly. Remember the journal?  Yes, remember that journal. I'm sorry it's such a terrible representation of me. How real is it? I don't know, it's not in my hands anymore. I hope it's in the trash by now. I don't know what I was thinking, but maybe my intuition was right too.  It's funny, I think back and I don't know of anyone else for whom I emptied myself out so completely. For a while, we were inseperable. And then things happened.  So I don't know what to do anymore. I won't try to disturb you again, I always felt queasy about that. But on this one night when I can't go to sleep, know that I'm still thinking about our good times.

      A little past 11pm. I'm tired. I have Cliff's bio propped open on my lap, the cover is sticking to my thighs. I've missed 21 questions for 89 problems. 70-something percent. Part of me wants to tell myself, "Give up, Lydia and go home." Another part just wants to cradle this book in my lap until i fall asleep and cannot retain any more information.   I know a lot of the time it's mind over matter, and that's what troubles me. I haven't taken the bio AP. I did the majority of my learning this past week. I know some of this stuff, but not the names, a major disadvantage when it comes to essays. And yet I know I'm supposed to be confident even though I really don't feel it.  Oh hi. Saprobes are...decomposers. Good.  In a day, I've gone through Jimmy Eat World, Outkast, Postal Service, Death Cab, Usher...just to try to stay awake. Perhaps it's worked. But I have Confessions stuck in my head now. Went to a study session with Erum, Nimo, Ryan, and John Skelly. You look at Nimo, hear him spout off enzymes, location of secretion and function and you know he's a candidate for a 5. Candidate? A surefire 5. It's just the difference between Lydia and retention on the history AP and Lydia and the bio AP.   But hey, I'm getting coffee tomorrow. Incentive enough? We'll see. So much is based on instinct now. I relinquish control. Scary thought.

      This is fact not fiction for the first time in years All the girls in every girlie magazine can't make me feel any less alone,  I'm reaching for the phone to call at 7:03 and on your machine,  I slur a plea for you to come home. But I know it's too late, and I should have given you a reason to stay Given you a reason to stay  Death Cab is awesome, and you know it.   Finished the review section in bio. Don't know if I want to go ahead and do labs today or go back to the beginning in review and start over, because that's just my way of doing things. But I'm satisfied right now, really. Finishing! I never thought it would happen, and now the bio AP seems less of a menace. But then again I've been listening to Outkast and then Death Cab for...three hours straight.   I guess you guys are right about getting B's. I'm really not planning to lecture the little kid, but to the way I perceive things (warped, of course) it's not the way to go. But then again that alerts me to how isolated I am from the normal majority of this population. I really don't mind. I just have to keep that in consideration when I pass judgments. But we're all going to be ok, really. As much of an agnostic I am, I would like to hope there's some divine force out there that punishes the unpunished, that fulfilles the ultimate desires of us all. We as a society just think success in terms of money and genius and (feigned) happiness. I've met a few people in my life who plan to defy that.   Religion is for the weak. I don't mean that in a bad way, but from just observing my own behavior I'll pray when I really need an extra crutch--unusual, since I don't go to church anymore. Church was a weird experiment. I only went because Mom and Grandma went. In Sunday School, we accumulated attendance points. And when Mom and Grandma decided not to go regularly, my attendance similarly faltered and I didn't earn as many points as I should have. (That's also my first memory of Derek Hsu, incidentally--he went to the same Sunday School as I did, though he probably doesn't remember anymore.) And then one day, I just decided that I was going to church for all the wrong reasons--to accumulate attendance points. It's a funny lesson in spirituality. I still have my Bible and my bookmarks. Biblical knowledge, funny enough, helps me in English 11AP. I'm not so much afflicted with pangs of conscience when my morality fails me. It's simply a source of comfort. I remember praying before I went to bed the night before piano competitions. Praying for sick people, or people who passed away. In a sense, my hypocritical, agnostic prayers serve the same purpose as this journal does, for emotional support. Secret, though.  Austin's going to private school next year. He's going to become a Viewpoint Patriot. Just the mascot Patriot makes me think of traditional Anglo-Saxon, East Coast values for some reason. I'll crack up if they have to wear navy blue blazers, striped ties and a handkerchief in the breast pocket. Hopefully, it'll do him some good. I hope he'll be happy, though. I often wonder what would've happened to me had I gone to Viewpoint too, but as a sophomore. I certainly wouldn't have adjusted very well. I wouldn't have journalism or mock trial or any of these wonderful people out there. If Austin becomes a snob and I find him driving a BMW or an Audi when I come home from college, I'm just going to realize that the system has failed us.   Have to go pick up Austin, none other.

      I woke up this morning, took a long shower, tried to rub sunburnt skin off, and got dressed, in running shorts and an old t-shirt, no less. There's an old McDonald's breakfast in the toaster right now. It's done. I'll eat it in a second, especially after Grandma gave me a sound lecture on eating breakfasts first thing this mid-morning.  The bio AP heading in front of me says Thermoregulation. Page 222.  I'm honestly so ready for this to be over. I know that's not deep, but think of all the crazy things I'll have time for once I finish this one bio AP. Needless to say, I am also driven by the usual Lydia desire (often irrational) to do well. But once I step out of that testing room, I can start enjoying the fact that the license comes in two weeks. I can actually go to class and not do anything since the teachers have pretty much stopped caring. I can sit back and relax, a bit...grades are ok. Oh, what an idyllic life that would be.  On the other hand, Austin isn't faring so well. I must have slept through it, for an apparent tiff over grades ocurred in the kitchen this morning: I see his grade printouts on the counter next to the Mother's Day roses and the balloons and I know it can't be good. What has he been doing this whole entire time? It's not like they're absolutely awful grades, but I'd really expect better from him. It's a strange sense of family pride, I suppose. He has B's. Damn him. He's only in the eighth grade, too--I think I'd be more likely to forgive him if he was at least in high school. Maybe it's an attitude problem of his, I know he has one. Or maybe it's because he spends too much time bumming on the computer. Whatever it is, he's in for some trouble.   And some of you might be laughing--B's, ha! Sometimes I just wonder how I grew up the way I am. The funniest thing is that I can honestly say I like my life, even though it might not seem like it with the stress. I'm reluctant to give all the credit to my parents, since they largely ignored my school performance when I was young anyways, and by the time it really mattered I'd learned to fend for myself. So why do I care so much about doing well? Why do I get a rush when I do well? Maybe it's just environmental support. Genes. At any rate, if I ever have a child, I want them to be just like me, exept I'd loosen the parental controls. Is that too weird of me? Too voyeuristic?  Breakfast awaits.

      I just realized that Mother's Day is very very soon. Ok, that's nice. I have to get something, I guess, but I don't know what.  I need to study for bio, but I'm watching TV. A celebration for finishing the US History AP, but I do need to hit the books soon.   That's not much information, is it? Nope.

      I'm here again. That's all I can think of. And I'm suffering from an inferiority complex.  I don't want tomorrow to come because that means after the AP I'll have to get to bio again, but then I want to get the AP over with too.  Waiting to drive is like running and that last stretch and the sprinter's kick that never comes. It's approaching, but you can't force yourself to go faster on that one last leg, and you are stifled. You push in your lungs to try to reach that finish in a grand style, and it just. doesn't. happen.  All of a sudden I feel sad and I don't know why. Not an angry sad but a why am I here? kind of sad. Loneliness hits at funny moments, punctuates silences. The most common one for me is getting out of the shower, wrapped in a towel and just standing there. And then it hits. I got that kind of feeling in English this morning too. And now. Is it deep-seated insecurity? A mind that refuses to fill itself with more efficient thoughts? I am happy, I tell myself. I am surrounded by great people. Life is promising, provided that I put in my share of the work. And yet, sometimes I wonder why this is all happening to me or what this is in the first place. It's love, yes. Not the canned, teenage kind of love but just a profound appreciation of everything I have every day. And then we ask ourselves, what is this love?   All right, enough metaphysical chatter.  My sunburn is peeling, yay.  I need to stop being needy.

      Feel slightly defeated right now: took a nap at 5 thinking I'd sleep until dinner at 7:30 and then work on history until bedtime, but I neglected to factor orchestra into the schedule. So now from 7-9 I can't be studying history.   Woke up a bit because Mom was going through an old tin of pens and pencils. I'm sleeping, damnit. Please make the noise louder so I sleep better. And then she has to yell at me three times in a row for mistakenly taking bath towels to the car wash. And then right after, she and the housekeeper start that annoying habit of continually calling people to dinner. I wish we could go to dinner whenever we wanted. It's apparently not enough to have two sitting at the table, all must be present despite varying degrees of hunger.  Watched the beginnings of Shattered Glass in journalism. Thought it would be over my head, like All the President's Men was (even with Zach's commentary), but this is strangely appealing. I will even go as far as to confess that I like the geeky charm of Hayden Christiansen enough to feel cheated when he started making facts up. I don't think I'll see the end, though. Normal school won't see me until next Tuesday.  Oh, what a life.

      Severly humbled.  I'm trying to go through Cliff's. I'm doing terribly. Sometimes I just want to quit, but then I remember that the curve is generous and that I've already paid for this test so I might as well take it. I'll be fine. I think I'm halfway through the review and a lot of the material ahead is some of the stuff I either absorbed at YSP or did in physio. I hope it will be fine, really. And I realize I need to study for history, too.  I still haven't gotten a test site for the June SATIIs. It worries me, in a pathetic, academically-obsessed kind of way. I don't approve, but I still need to test math before time runs out.   But seriously now, can I be an academic jerk and have everyone else leave me alone? I'll do what I need to do according to my standards; I don't want to be a normal student, thank you. So what if I prefer to study? Do well on tests? I'll regulate my life, they'll regulate theirs if they're wise. I'm not trying to live by Asian stereotypes here. It's what I want out of myself. It's not any more Asian of me than the next white guy who also prefers to do well. It's just stupid how...well, it's just stupid. I just ran out of brain juice. It's AP week, and I'm not a happy camper.  My sunburn itches.

      I wake up from a 2.5-hour nap (too long, I say) and the prevailing thought in my head is Death Cab's lyrics from "A Lack of Color:" "I should have given you a reason to stay/given you a reason to stay."  No, I shouldn't give a reason for you to stay. I guess I'm very quiet lately. I like to attribute it to AP week and concentration on studies, but deep down I'm not so sure. I shouldn't have started it again. Leave it to me to screw things up, I'm a natural.  I'm glad I only have to feel this disoriented once a day. It's terrible. I'm invariably disturbed from slumber over dinner concerns. I'm still not awake by the time I sit down at the table; Mom often asks me if I'm daydreaming. I still have many pages in Cliff's to go, to start with.  And logically, the next track starts running in my head too: "I've got a hunger/twisting my stomach into knots."  I still have to write a column. I was thinking on taking the concept of love and turning it into something, but it won't work: I've already started out too phony. I looked up the words to "Love Changes Everything" and a slightly unshaven Greg on the next computer (playing Mario, no less) wouldn't convince himself that no, I wasn't writing a love poem to him. Columns have to go somewhere, I tell myself. This love idea is going to sound way too nostalgic for someone who isn't even graduating this year, but I'll miss my seniors. Oh man. Journalism is going to be abysmal without them. I'm trying not to count down the days. I'll miss Pegleg and Keira and Brandon the most, but the others are awesome too. Pegleg promises to come back and help us out.  Off to study. To finish talking to Ellis and Steve and then off to study, hah.

      on another sidebar/editorial note/rant: I don't like my brother's xanga site. It's so immature and dramatic. Just like him. Was I like that when I was his age? Sometimes I see myself hating my old self when I was similarly naive.  I'm going to take a nap. Austin's blog can...do whatever it wants. He doesn't know I read it. Thank goodness he doesn't know mine. Or does he? I would get in a lot of trouble if he did.

      I usually don't lust for things. But today and eating watermelon was probably close. It was just so good. Chicken, fried rice but no cake. It's stuck at the bottom of the fridge beneath all the other party food. Maybe later, I console myself.   Very tempted to practice the art of selective skipping, though it'd only be logical to skip periods 1 and 2 tomorrow. And I'd probably sleep in until 9 on a normal day anyways, not study. I need to do bio, and I didn't realize how much I should do for history until last night. Oops, I forgot to bring Princeton for Wendy. But I'm starting to read Barrons. It's actually pretty good.  I want to take a nap right now. Is that weird?  Keira got asked to prom yesterday, lol. It was cute. I just wonder what it's going to be like next year. We're going to have APs again, we're going to be suffering from senioritis, we're going to be scrambling for prom dates? Somehow that seems weird. But it's sweet. And a year away, so what the hell.  Starting a list: Things I want to do after APs: read Peace Like a River, or books in general go shopping with Jess go crazy  I didn't used to get so fatigued so easily. Guess I'm not in my prime anymore. Every day I come home, eat and then sleep sooner or later, at least before bedtime. It'll work. I'll make it work.

      It's nice to have the air on for a bit, but now I'm freezing. How's that for a summer night? It's not even summer yet. I stand corrected.  I did 100 pages in Cliff's, except page 100 was blank. Well, I've met my quota for today, though I believe my knowledge of meiosis and mitosis and respiration are still spotty. But hey, that's all right. 100 pages a day, and then some time left over for review. I tell myself that if I really truly want to do well on this bio AP I might as well apply myself.   So now it's 10pm and I still haven't done math homework. I vaguely remember something about matrices, Andrew brought up nonlinear equations last night and I didn't know what he was talking about. Sorry for snapping, Andrew.  We got a lot of English homework today. Arr.  I listened to Jack Johnson today. Again. I kind of got sick of the Postal Service, maybe. I still can't find Jimmy Eat World. Oh well.   Not bad, don't you think?

      Hah, I can't stop laughing.   I was sleeping and ignoring all orders to get up when Parshaw called. From the hospital. I regret not going today, it would have been awesome. But yeah. I'll stop there. I doubt it'll happen. In fact, I bet myself $5 it won't happen. How's that, huh?  Imagine the red car, the red car.   Wait, that's such a little whore of me, too. What would I do, really? Well. I have nothing to do that day. Hi Jean. I'm makin' you happy.  Today's Grandma's birthday, and Doupe's too. They've decided to have a party. On a Tuesday night. So I have to clean out the media room. I've started reading Cliff's. I hope it won't be impossible, or I sense a shitty day coming up. I don't really see how I can get work done tonight, but what do they care?  So now, the happy result is that I'm up, albeit still in a crumpled shirt and running shorts. I refuse to clean up. I still have fifty pages to go before I meet my quota. My mouth tastes slightly of toothpaste and my reactions are still slow. That was a lovely nap until I got yelled at, really.  I sense a generalization coming up, but I'll check myself. Good day to you all.

      Ok, I give up. I've finally realized after an hour or so of tinkering that I'm really not meant for this blogging/coding business. I tried changing some things. Some worked, which you notice. Some didn't. Of course, I prefer to hide those from you.  I wonder where Mom put my AP bio book.  I almost fell asleep during the Spanish AP today. Wiggling the feet helped. So did touching the sunburn so that the pain would jolt me back into reality. Didn't get that solid feeling like I did Monday. But it's over. Shall I lament some more?  I have to find some time to do math homework. I'm not too excited, though.

      Relatively happy and carefree. Until I realize I really have to start studying for bio if I'm to make anything of that precious $82 fee. And I've spent a few minutes talking to Scott about old YSP times. Yeah, that's the way to go.  I miss YSP. Not that aching, homesickness, where am I? kind of feeling but that nostalgic man, those were good times kind of feeling. I miss waking up late in the morning when Alissa has already gone to breakfast and I'm just too lazy to venture into the DC. I miss hopping on the bike and riding out to the greenhouses as fast as I can because I'm late. I miss coming back for lunch, listening to crazy conversations and wanting to laugh so hard. I miss letters from Tiff and Jess and Tiff and emails from Nige and reading them and laughing. I miss trips into town with the girls on the floor, I miss playing mafia, even if it's by flashlight at the Mt. Lassen campgrounds at midnight. I miss just talking to these awesome people, being around them, running into them. I still talk to Katy, of course, and Kylan and Abdul and Scott G. Lauren occasionally. Maybe Sabrina. Takao is going to  Yale. Wow. I didn't see that coming. But good for him, really.  Piano lesson was actually all right. Played through the entire Schumann, first movement. A judge remarked that I slouched. (yeah I do!) Mr. Francis wants me to play both Bach showcase and Colburn. I object, but what can I say?  I just looked up Hegel to make sure he was the plain/pleasure guy. Yes, he is. Would the AP language readers know? Maybe not, but I don't want to pass myself up as a fraud. I liked that third essay, yes I did. The other ones were mediocre.   I'm just comfortable the way I am right here. I don't want to budge to study Spanish.   Sometimes I just wonder why I spend so much time typing up these things. It's personal satisfaction, yes, but then I must keep in mind the danger of giving substance to my errant thoughts. It's done me a good deal of harm before. I just wonder if I'm going to look back in a year and ask myself why I was so stupid to think like this. This surely isn't as extreme as the last piece of damning evidence, but it's still a record of thoughts. I'm not obsessing over anyone, that's a plus at least. I'm hoping I'm less of a self-centered, arrogant little priss this timea around. But then again, I think: that one hurtful piece of egotism: I don't like to hear it repeated back at me (especially with editorial underscores), but was it wrong to think that way? Maybe I was judging on too superficial of a level. How true the statement is, I don't care. Oh, but it was such a pretty little book, that cream paper, the leaf pressed into the leather cover. But at least this is somewhat censored; I have a wider audience to consider. I just can't believe I screwed up my whole entire mental state sophomore year, at least. But that's what sophomore year's for, right? Petty, sophomoric deeds that make you want to forget that they ever happened. I was happy then. Not now. Is that wrong? I don't think it is, but I've been criticized for being cold before. I've tried too hard, though. And I hate myself now for it. I keep on interpreting everything as hah, he's finally learned. That's what I looked like last year! That's too cruel of me, though. That kind of statement could hurt me again.  Enough of that. I don't care. I'm surrounded by wonderful people, and that's all right by me.   Over dinner, Mom and Grandma talked about family ties. About how distant relatives married, got divorced. How kids wouldn't listen and turned out useless. I wonder, am I doomed to become dinnertime conversation twenty years down the road? In my mind, marriage is sacrosanct; I don't believe in agreeing to it and then changing your mind a few years down the road. I want to make a name for myself. Oh hell, what does it matter. It's AP week.  Get a life, Lydia.

      Post-car wash: my feet are utterly disgusting from being soaked for...five hours straight. They look like mud that's so dry that it's crackled. I think I'm burned in the shoulders, it hurts. And my whole body feels crusty from soap and tap water. I need to shower. I have Incubus stuck in my head.   But hey, it was all right. Peter and Ellis showed up, which was a lovely surprise. So did some other people I wasn't expecting. Andrew and Charlie hung around for a bit. First real interaction with next year's anatomy class. If Nimo's in, it's going to be fantastic. Otherwise, I guess it's ok. There's Erum and Nige, still.   Oops, I have no earrings in.   I made showcase. That's a burden off my back, and now I can skip the Colburn recital. Yay.  I don't want to go to dinner tonight. I guess it's going to be all right, but I just don't want to stand around or be harrassed by the parents or be distracted. It's selfish of me, and I've complained too much already. It just doesn't seem real. Tomorrow I'm sitting in for my first AP of junior year. Tuesday will be the second. Am I ready? Can I do this? I pretty much assumed English wouldn't be so terrible, but I woke up this morning and thought, Lydia, who are you kidding? How can you assume like that? I would really like a 5. On all of the APs. Is that too much to ask? No, if I study right.  I really want to drive. I was in a rush this morning and Dad let me drive myself down to the lot, but then I chickened out and asked him to come. I know I can't just take the car anywhere before I get my license. Very tempted, though.  My Postal Service CD just materialized. Good. I'm tired. Maybe I'll shower. Or I'll just take a practice test and play PS loudly. I have an hour and a half left of freedom.

      Almost yesterday, those gentle ladies stole to their baths in Atlantic City, for the lost rites of the first sea of the first salt running from a faucet. I have heard they sat for hours in briny tubs, patting hotel towels sweetly over shivered skin, smelling the stale harbor of a lost ocean, praying at last for impossible loves, or new skin, or still another child. And since this was the style, I don't suppose they knew what they had lost.  Almost yesterday, pushing West, I lost ten Utah driving minutes, stopped to steal past postcard vendors, crossed the hot slit of macadam to touch the marvelous loosed bobbing of The Salt Lake, to honor and assault it in its proof, to wash away some slight need for Maine's coast. Later the funny salt itched in my pores and stung like bees or sleet. I rinsed it off on Reno and hurried to steal a better proof at tables where I always lost.  Today is made of yesterday, each time I steal toward rites I do not know, waiting for the lost ingredient, as if salt or money or even lust would keep us calm and prove us whole at last.  I love this poem. I found it on the SATII literature test. It's elegant, to say the very least. I just don't know how I did on that test. History curve seems pretty low, which is reassuring. Wendy directed me to a collegeconfidential post, I know I missed some questions and did ok on others. I'm curious for writing and lit. It's not like it was absolutely terrible, the kind of test that gives you that ugly feeling. I spent too much time on the initial part of the lit section and then I realized I was going too slow. Thank goodness I understood the last section, though. Or so I thought. Collegeconfidential is going to keep me amused for days, weeks maybe. I read about the stats of these people and wonder if I'm ever going to make it. I told Andrew I didn't think 1510 was enough on the phone. He hung up soon after, lol. Hi Andrew. I found an Edith Wharton passage on the Lit. I think it was from Ethan Frome. At any rate, I got so excited that I scrawled EDITH WHARTON on the top of the page.  There's this race of student out there who thinks that a 1400 is stellar and all they could ask for. And then there's the type on collegeconfidential who just about assures you that a 1510 is paltry work. I admire the people who can score the 1600 on the first sitting and just get it out of the way. I admire the people who can at least get a 1550. That's good enough for me, seriously. I know you'll laugh, and I'm going to let you laugh away, but those are my standards. So quickly do things change: I thought I was lucky to get that 1510, now I realize it's nothing big. 800M isn't too difficult for most people. I think it's the verbal that does them in. It hurt me.   So I don't know how I did. I think it was ok, but it wasn't like the ease encountered during state testing. Nothing is. We will see. Anything above 750 is done for me. I think I'll have to retake some of them, perhaps. But I have time. I need time.  Bach Regionals today. There is no terror like waiting to play piano. It wasn't flawless, but it didn't fall apart either. I don't know. Do I really care anymore? What is it going to do for me in the long run? I still want it, though. It just means that I'm worth something. There are so many little kids playing now. I think there were probably 5 or so out of nearly 20 who were at least my age. I wonder what I looked like playing piano when I was littler. I no longer see the strong bunch of high schoolers. Well, maybe they weren't in the 3pm program.  So I've delayed studying. I have English to touch up on. I think I'll take practice tests tonight. I better get going on bio, too. That's a scary thought. Ow, that's a loud Goo Goo Dolls song. I ate chili and saltines. I watched Queer Eye. I looked up test answers. I puttered around aimlessly.   Thinking about it, English and Spanish shouldn't be that bad in terms of studying, so I have more time for history and bio. I should go out and get Clif's.   I have an annoying tendency of doing something completely and utterly stupid and looking back later to grasp how idiotic it was. In this case, I just don't want to go back, I'm really happy where I am. He said some things that shocked me, that would have surely melted me six months ago. But I really don't care anymore. That's not so terrible, is it? I've grown up. I really want him to throw away that damn journal. And that's it. It's one of those icky things that I used to do and now I regret, heavily. I don't want to have anything to do with him except to know that we're on civil terms, nothing more.   I can't be tired already.

      Sometimes I sit here and think of the state of the world and it makes me feel sad. Materialism, namely.  And then it also makes my blood boil to listen to some crazy things. This girl walked in today seriously thinking that this summer program was going to improve chances for Harvard admission. Another swore that between Wesleyan and Wellesley, Wesleyan was for all girls (it isn't).  You know, I'm at Harvard and for that much, I should be thrilled. But the chief thing that annoys me here is the people, I guess. Or at least the random sampling I've seen. Maybe that's not the way to put it. I just wish I were surrounded by geniuses and had to work my butt off, relatively speaking, but it doesn't seem as vibrant or competitive as YSP.   Sylvia and Ellis (wherever you guys are) are trying to convince me to go out and socialize and all, but frankly, I'm happy being the antisocial little weirdo I am. It's not like I don't have friends here, and it's not like I'm socially uncomfortable, so why bother? Thanks for the excellent advice, Wendy.  More Freud. He's really boring, for the record.

      I should really be reading Freud right now, but I'm very very tempted to write. And I've given in.  Sometimes when I'm brushing my teeth and look into the mirror, I know that I'm really not up to level yet: that everything I go out and say isn't going to be witty or mind-boggling or funny, that every reflection of me isn't going to look fantastic, that I'll have my share of stumbling and tripping for the day because after all, I'm clumsy.   And then I go into lit yesterday and discover this: we're talking about the problems with the self, and Virginia Woolf offers "sensibility:" only the parts of you that you like. So you just decide to turn off when you're not brilliant. That you only live the best parts of you. I really wish I could do that. I mean, we all have our bad days...woulnd't it be perfectly lovely to erase those from our existences? And then there's the idea of "mench," or ordinary; accepting the fact that you're not going to be the greatest person day in and day out and that you should just accept.  I'm looking at my notes.  It's really easy to email Harvard people here. They're always going to email you back, and promptly. Since I'm so bent on communication, I suppose you could say that this is exactly what I'm looking for: efficient communication.  I'm really going to go read now.

      I think the only comparison for life right now would be a Sex and the City episode.   But that's only because of my gross lack of exposure popular culture, evidenced when Charlie and Matt and Jen start talking about movies and I'm left to mull over the state of my mashed potatoes or something.   It's not sexual, that's not the point I'm getting across. It's just scattered episodes. Maybe I'll have to read Calvino to get that kind of feeling too. It's just...there's some sort of underlying drama that irritates me somehow and I don't know the answer to it.  In the end, I'm reassured by the fact that I know that everything will be ok. It's not even a matter of doubt at all. I know that once I get home I'll be with the people I love most again--that goes for family and friends. Everyone.  I think they're having a party downstairs in 14. I think, "Well, this is it. They've started getting cliquey too."   I'm switching psych to introduction to social anthropology. I've already written this to Ellis (who hasn't bothered to manifest in his online form yet, quite an amazing feat), but...it's just a more intimate setting, a smaller class, a better professor. I exchanged my books. I'll visit Holworthy tomorrow to get the necessary forms.  So it ends up that I have nothing on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays-Sundays, so it'll be an exercise in self-control. I have classes back-to-back for five hours when I do. I almost fell asleep today. Class always seems unbearably long, but I tell myself that it's not unfair to the Harvard experience to criticize classes for being long.  And I'm going to go. More later.

      Day three.  I've finally bought, rented and connected all necessary tools to get the internet at my desk. Sure, I could say I'm addicted. But there's nothing that really attracts me right now in terms of something to do. So I'm online. And blogging away again.  Transatlanticism is playing. I love it, but it just sounds so tinny on the computer and I almost feel some sort of guilt or embarrassment playing it. It's just so much better playing when you're driving home and nobody else is in the car so you can meditate on it alone.  I need to shower tonight.   Well, today's been a full day at least. Don't misread this and think in any way that I'm not happy with the way things are. It's really nice to get some fresh air away from home, to just do whatever pleases you and let your own judgment keep you out of trouble. Got up for breakfast, but I was the only one clad in pajama pants...the blue squares one. I didn't think beforehand how long of a walk it would be, so I ended up walking down Harvard St. and Mass. Ave. in pajamas. Certainly nobody shared my choice of attire. The good people of the world were already up and fed and ambulatory in normal clothing. Visited the science center for the hub, came back. Went to the Coop, where we meditated over buying magnetic poetry pieces and laughed over books before we actually got what we were looking for. Visited the CVS in the Square. Came back for lunch, headed to class.  Class! Intro to Psychology. I really don't know what to think of it now. I'm sure I didn't leave Boylston feeling like wow, this was going to be the best class ever, but how accurate are first impressions? I need an introductory psych course, yes. The professor is an oldish man who's interesting enough, but funnily I prefer the lectures of Dean Soutter; she's just so much more refreshing. We went over the basics today. It doesn't seem like the class will be unimaginably difficult, but I just wonder if it's going to be as inspiring as I hope lit will be tomorrow. You know the feeling when it makes you smile and everything. Psych today was just an "eh" kind of thing.  But I'm going to sit in on social anthropology tomorrow at 1 and go to lit at 3:30, so I'll have a full day and decide if psych is really for me. The great thing is that it's the first day of social anthropology too, so it's not like I'm going to be missing out if I do decide to change my mind. Lit is pretty much a definite, but probably only because I'm such a book nut.  And now it's time to go wake Matt up.

      I have a song from Love Actually (heh) stuck in my head: "Bye bye baby, baby, good bye..."  Except that's Ironic. With a capital I. (Ellis, note the usage. It's wrong, kill me). Everything's just beginning, and it's beautiful.  I guess you could say that today's the last official day of freedom since classes start tomorrow and with that comes homework and reading and the like. The last day left blissfully untinted with obligation, at least. I'm ready for whatever comes, though. It's the dorky, scholarly side showing through.   Went to church this morning for the first time in a long time. Actually, not this morning if this program is still on western time...it's 12:41 am as I type. Memorial Church is everything you'd think a church to be. As Matt and I were walking in, there was Handel playing on an organ, and one could only stare in awe at the vaulted ceilings, the corinthian columns...just everything on such a magnificient and ornate scale that it beats any "normal" place of worship I've seen. Well, I can definitely say I've forgotten a lot of what I've learned in church, but I think it's probably a good habit to start again.  Woke Charlie up, went to the activities fair, got lunch. Waited in line for three hours--my fault, of course--for Yale and Brown trips. The guys are going to Newport, I'm almost tempted to go too. Should I? It's another $25 and Mom and Dad could probably take me. Oh, but I want to be home for registration. That just occurred to me. Went to Starbucks, met up with Jen, had a good, solid conversation. I must admit it's really nice to be talking like that...everything around here lately is so superficial (as in, merely scratching the surface) since nobody knows each other. I know the danger of just staying friends with home people, but for now they're excellent company. And it's funny. I think I get along better with guys than I do with girls.   Sarah, Ishita and Shoan Yin rented a microfridge. I was the only one who opted out. I feel like a loser.   Aunt Hong Ha also tried to drop some food by, but I either wasn't there or didn't get reception. I felt so bad and sat through the rules meeting with a knot in my stomach. I was itching to go, but only to see if I could catch them before they decided to give up and leave. Well, I didn't. But I activated my voice mail and found 10 messages, haha. Next Friday I'll see them. I feel bad, though. I mean, I don't know how I would've made it through early Saturday without getting a ride from them to Harvard, but I really don't need them now. But I feel an obligation to be nice for Mom's sake. I'll work it out.  Rules, rules, rules. But it turns out we can have weekend stayovers with us, as long as a whole bunch of people consent.  Classes start tomorrow. I think I'll preview Principles of Editing just because, and then I have psych in the afternoon. I'm meeting Charlie and Matt and Jen and taking Shoan Yin with me to breakfast. See, I think meals are awkward. There's 1000 kids and it's outright scary to expect to walk into Annenberg alone and find someone you know and can bear. So I think we'll stick together for the next few days, at least. Until schedules are settled.  I really had a good day. I wonder what I'm going to do now, though, if I prefer guy company to that of my dorm mates. We'll see. It's late. I'm kind of hungry, but I'll sleep it off. And there's always the promise of breakfast.

      First post from Harvard!  I've been dying to do this all day, but I just wrote Mrs. B too, so bear with me if I sound sluggish or bored or anything.  I don't know how many hours I've been up now, since the red eye addles everything and the excitement in itself is just enough to keep one up. No curfew, either, though I'm not taking it to full advantage yet. I think most of us don't know each other quite well, even suitemates. I hope that changes once we actually get into classes.  But there are 1000 HS students here! So it's none of that cozy, YSP feel. I'm taking pictures, yes, but I don't have a cable so I can't really put them up quite yet. There's one ethernet jack for the whole room, so I'm taking Sarah's desk right now until they send that 50-footer from home.  So the roomies: Shoan Yin: I've known her the longest through talking and all and I guess we assigned each other to look out for each other. We're in the same bedroom, and the other two are in the other one. From Canada. Very chatty, observant. More Chinese than American, I think. No holds barred on summer spending, though.  Ishita: I keep on forgetting her name. She's nice, but not particularly conversational. Indian. Intro to Bio. Is spending the night with her parents at a hotel because they're going to be in town a bit longer.  Sarah: Our local Boston girl. Asleep right now, but I don't blame her. Has a voice like Christina Lamb's. Has a friend here too, they kind of stick together. I have the idea that she's the most social of the bunch. She was here first and took a bed, etc. which kind of annoyed me, but we're ok now.  Other people:  Nora: our proctor. From Arizona, timid, red hair. Harvard student There's some pretty nice girls down the hall too.  But it's weird, I like Charlie's dorm best of all. OF course, there's Charlie...I don't think I would be as comfortable as I am now without knowing someone close by. And his roommate Matt is also very approachable. I'm going to church with him tomorrow. Remember how I've always been tempted to go back to church? Well, here's my chance at a fresh start though I neglected to bring the Bible with me...well, if it really matters that much I'll go out and get my own. NIV this time, heh.  I like it here. I've unpacked, walked around both with friends and alone. I guess we're pretty quiet these first few days. Watched Underworld with Pennypacker 16, long long film. I have internet, which makes me happy. Very happy. And I'm just about to go to bed; I need to wake up tomorrow morning and shower off all that summer yucky sweat.  It's really a new world. I'm not homesick or anything, just completely open.  Mark's here, and I saw Vicky Ho today!   Well, wish me luck. It's the beginning of another grand adventure. Miss you all, and love you lots!

      I can clearly feel the effects of being in the sun for too long--that is, by my standards. After cleaning up, walking places, etc. I'm tired and too warm.  So this is the last blog entry before I go. It's about time to pack up the computer and put it in the suitcase. There's something about disconnecting everything that makes me feel sad. I have to shower, and then pack the rest of my bathroom stuff. And then, pretty much, I'll be all good to go.  I haven't been the best child lately. It's almost like a soap opera or something. Someone delivers a weighty piece of news and you have to wait until tomorrow night 9/8C to find out what happens next, except there's nothing like that for me. So I've been thinking about it all day. Certainly, it curbs some otherwise unstoppable desires.  I'll just lay low until it's time to leave.

      I have a new theory: Asian kids overachieve to buy a little more time, more patience, more leeway from the parents.   But that's crappy, I think. An 800 isn't going to last you very long. Education's the only sanctuary, which is horribly sad. I get eight weeks of freedom because it's Harvard Summer School. RHP was similarly motivated.  If I detached myself from this unit and transplanted myself to a similar but more tolerant one, I think my life would be perfect.  My only consolation: I'm going away soon. Damn it all.

      And I'm back.   I don't like the thought of packing up this computer. It's two conflicting desires: either I can pack it up now and get it over with and also know how much room I have left in my suitcase, or I can let it sit here until I have to leave for the airport tomorrow, and then I'll pack it.   I'm almost done putting stuff in order, which makes me happy.  Went to the driving range. I committed a few traffic crimes, though. Wasn't pleasant. It's unfamiliar driving my own designated car again.  I realize more and more why I'm not made for golf. Every shot counts.  I'm too tired to keep anything up.

      Hello, and good morning.   I couldn't really stand getting cranky at myself, so here I am. Packing's just the thing to tick you off, really. First, there's the fact that Mom's pushing you to do it, which automatically makes it much less attractive. Then there's the concept that you should get everything together in the same place at the same time, but unfortunately, that's not humanly possible: I still need to get shorts in MA, I have to do the laundry, I can't pack certain things until Friday morning, like the alarm clock.   So I have one big suitcase for clothes and bedding and another miscellaneous one for whatever I thought I might need as well. Looking at it, it doesn't seem like much at all. I'm starting to wonder what I brought to Davis that made it such a bulky load, since the biggest thing I'm bringing this time is probably...the desk lamp. Too bad we threw away the box sometime between CTY and now.  I know there's a myriad of things to do. Little things, to be precise, which is all the more frustrating since it means running around all over in search of some indispensible but currently inconsequential object. I've started a pile of things I need to put in suitcase number two. As soon as I'm done here, I need to take my backpack upstairs, dirty bottom and all.  Printer paper would be nice too.  Ooh, I found the Jimmy Eat World CD. Though Austin's being a miser about loaning stuff again. I should've expected it. Brat.  I really don't have any idea what I'm going to do pent up all day. Besides pack and clean up, maybe. Driving Mom and Grandma nuts is the default, I don't have to try hard for that one.  So I guess this is my Thursday: I'm doomed to stay at home doing something that drives me nuts. I haven't told them that I'm going to the driving range tonight. I don't think they'll be pleased, but what the hell: Mom's going to drop Austin off at River Ridge, go have lunch with friends, go to Oxnard and drop by Dad's work.  I wonder what that sounds like.   (Hypocrite!)  Too much fun for you, Mom.

      Ok now, I'm going to officially shut up. I'll go to the driving range tomorrow if I want to. I'll pack, work everything out. I wish I had some alternative swear word; I was going to say "Christ," again. Well, you know what I mean.   We all have our problems, I guess. It's no help that everyone has to share them and spread the joy. I really am fine. I just momentarily got pissed.  I have to remember I have "jorge luis borges" scrawled in highlighter here before it fades away. Ah, books.  If everyone just stopped PMS-ing on me, I think it'd help greatly. Or if I just sat down all day and scribbled in a notebook. I think that's just about the only thing that keeps me sane these days.  NOBODY'S HOME, mentally.  Ah, it's Franz Ferdinand. Congealed brains, how incredibly appropriate.  How come I can be happy for a while and let everyone else just trample on it? Because I'm weak. Because I care too much about what other people say.  The downside to never telling anyone the whole story (especially the parents) is that there's a whole lot of explaining to do when you screw up. So either I have to be absolutely invincible or as open as a book. I choose invincibility. Not going to happen, so I'm screwed anyways. How lovely. Happy summer, people.  Well guess what, 48 hours from now I'll probably be sitting in a plane, seat 6E, ready to take off and visit the land of no curfew, no parents and big big city.  If I were Christian, would I handle things differently? They always seem so saintly. I'm anything but and all over the place.  Looking at my life from a distance assures me that having children will be one hell of a ride.  Ok, I'm really calm now. I think I'll go pack: look for spare staples, find a tape dispenser, scissors. Towel, crap like that. I need to fish the Franz Ferdinand CD out of the car and play it at volume level 16 to make me happy. I'm happy, darnit. It takes a little believing yet.

      Spoiled brat syndrome.   I can't believe Mom doesn't really approve of my finding something to do during summer. What am I supposed to do pent up at home? The laundry. Packing. Organizing. Reading. Everything to drive me nuts.  Here I just want to cry. Gosh darnit.  Dear lord, it's funny how she lectures me on being out all day when she's guilty of the same crimes. If they can even be called crimes. I'm just inexplicably angry right now. I don't know why--that's the point.  How can Mom be so naive?  Thinking of things I need to pack, I don't know what else I should include. Everything else is still in use or isn't here or already in the suitcase. There's no use in overpacking.  I can't think clearly right now.  Today was a good day. Until Mom ruined it for me. Ha.

      Well, after negotiations, introspective writing and a surprisingly calm phone call with Mom, I can go.  The catch is, I can't drive myself to Nigel's house. I guess that's all right, the biggest stab is at my ego. I'd like to drive as far as I can by myself, but Mom took the 4runner.  Hm.

      Arrrrgh. I just woke up to Grandma talking on the phone. Nothing in my body is functioning correctly yet.  I just sat on the edge of my bed for a while last night thinking with the Postal Service stuck in my head. "You don't go play golf with your dad on Father's Day but you go out with friends!" I mildly feel like I've betrayed someone.  I need to shower. In less than three hours I'm going to Nigel's to go to Third Street. Grandma came into my room last night and chastised me for returning late with the worst sour face in the world, and I'm supposed to sweet talk her for the use of her car today, since Mom drove my car again. At least I have something to drive. I don't want lunch. I know she'll make noise over that. I think I'll just shower and read.  Still tired.

      It's funny how nobody else I know feels this compulsion to constantly write in a blog. Well, that's all right. I do't really mean for anyone to read the meandering thoughts of a bored teenage girl anyways, and I'm dead serious. I like to think I'm writing for myself.  I didn't want to get out of bed this morning so I turned on my CD player and wrapped the blankets around my head. "Such Great Heights," oh sappiness.   More adventures on the road: I hate how every gas...dispenser? you know what I mean...beeps when you press a button or something. I almost take it as a personal affront, it's so hostile. BEEP Your receipt is ready, not that you haven't taken it out of the slot as soon as it got there...I filled up for Grandma today. Couldn't remember which side it was on so I tried one, failed and did some crazy maneuver that directed me to the other side. I almost left the cover open too, as I did yesterday. When I got out of my car, safely parked in the garage, I realized the 4runner still had the cap attached to the door, which was wide open. I started to pretend that those spots on the garage floor were gasoline and flirted with the idea of taking a match to them to see if I really was a leaking idiot. I didn't, but you know that. I don't like matches. It doesn't make sense to hold it up to keep it from burning to your fingertips.  So hello, it's 8 minutes past noon and I'm going to magically occupy myself until it's time to change into that oversized green shirt and white pants, put on the badge, the socks and the smile and go volunteer. Sigh. What a life.  My brother's computer is gurgling.  I have a tape of my CWOTO, yay. I want to listen to it to see if it's any good...college-worthy, perhaps? Who knows. I don't know.  On my third Echo Heron book since I'm really that demented.   You know, I really don't have to start packing yet until Friday. It's a drag.  Everyone's gone, how sad.  Here I laugh. You poor, self-pitying, bumbling creature.

      There's something that scares me when it comes to classics.  I've returned from Barnes and Noble with three books: Sons and Lovers (D.H. Lawrence), Middlemarch (George Eliot) and the Portrait of a Lady (Henry James). All told, that's probably 1800 pages. Mrs. B recommended them all.   Driving home, I groan and wonder why I try to tackle this load especially since Light in August is less than appealing right now, and I should finish it just to have one Faulkner under my belt. But then I think, these are classics! They must've been wildly popular at some point in time. So I keep faith and hope they're worth reading. At least it was a bargain, ha.  Well, I just looked through Sons and Lovers. Seems interesting enough to read.   Got information for senior pictures today, but I won't be able to make the July 30 appointment. Senior pictures! It's just not time yet, I think. I guess I'll call them tomorrow and ask them to get me a later appointment.  More list-making. Things I have to do before I leave: return library books purchase the following:     contact solution     laundry hamper of some sorts     socks     batteries for flashlight     small trash can, perhaps pack, of course (taking down the pictures will be sad) fill out Amherst app find headphones  Well, now I want to start reading, but I'm also inclined to save that for Harvard. Hm. Dilemmas.  Tomorrow: I think I'll get up late, have lunch and then read until I have to go volunteer. That'll eat up enough time.  The only thing I'm afraid of now is boredom.

      The headache disappered over lunch at Wendy's with Sylvia. I don't know when was the last time I laughed so much. Or used Ryan as a sort of benchmark for how much I've grown.   Well, I have to go, but before I do, this is what I have stuck in my head.  Franz Ferdinand: Take Me Out  So if you're lonely You know I'm here waiting for you I'm just a crosshair I'm just a shot away from you.  And if you leave here You leave me broken, shattered, I lie I'm just a crosshair I'm just a shot, then we can die.  Maybe I shouldn't have listened to it before I went to bed. I had a dream about crosshairs.

      I don't know what I'm doing here.  I realize I start almost every entry with "I," but I suppose that's the point, isn't it? No, it actually isn't. How off-center I am.  Am having serious qualms about materialism and some things that go on. I want to make some use of my time so I end up reading on the couch. Television seems too outright lazy.  I've so lost track of what I want to be. What do I want to do, anyways? I'm having lunch with Sylvia tomorrow. I have a piano lesson. I'm going to volunteer on Tuesday, go to the beach on Friday. Go to Third Street with Nige on Wednesday. And that's my week up until flying to Boston Friday night.  It's just all so wrong, I think. And I don't know why. Really now, what is the meaning of life? You just have to think, most of the people you know are purely worthless to you. And then you have your friends, which you purposely try to keep small in number, because what's the point of having so many people around you? I need a project, a magnum opus.  You know, I was also thinking of how lucky I am. In some ways, I have it good, and I won't number them here. Secrets are better kept inside.  Maybe it's just going crazy without having something regular to do. I would really be a wreck if I retired. There's no more school and schoolwork and orchestra anymore. I'm only home for two weeks and a little more, so that eliminates the possibility of a job. I've already washed a goodly amount of dishes, taken out the trash. The suitcase is cracked open on the floor in my room. Today I've read, I've gone out with Mom and Grandma, I've returned the cable to Best Buy since Mom has one. I've worn the same pair of jeans for a few days now, not that anybody really cares. In a funny way, I almost don't want anybody's company to fill this void. I think I'd be equally happy entertained with a movie, except I don't feel like one.  Well now, I guess I'm just mercurial and picky and lost.  I think I could just sit here forever and write nothingness. I was up in bed reading last night since I couldn't fall asleep and all of a sudden the words on the page distanced themselves and I felt dizzy. Everything is just so messed up.  I'm so confused.  What could I do that takes up the whole entire day and is marginally appealing? I imagine I'm going to go somewhere, but I feel bad about spending money.   That's funny, I don't now. Wednesday's a go.  I'm trying to fill out that Amherst app.  Maybe I should go online and request real applications, that would be somewhat productive.  Yeah, I'll go do that now.  I'm all right, don't listen to me.

      Utopia would exist if only we had our own little exclusive bubbles that never intersected with any other bubble. But that's impossible, so we have what we have today.  You know, Enid, I'm not much for a bitch fight-esque argument, so I'll just leave it at this: I don't question your lifestyle, and I don't see any reason for you to question mine. But in any case, if you do, I'd greatly appreciate it if you didn't do it in front of my face. Pretend for a second that our bubbles don't intersect at all.  Go on, have a nice life. And don't tell me about it. And don't editorialize on mine.  Funny thing is, you don't have to read this. So I'll cordially invite you to stop reading.

      I really don't know why I do this anymore. Why not just settle down for a lazy night on the couch in front of the TV?  But I'm in the land of the perpetual headache. I hate stop-and-go traffic and lack of car music. I wouldn't doubt that I've lost quite a few brain cells.  Old news.

      Almost ready to go out on one of those Asian family excursions into the Valley (here I remember Thursday's Sex and the City) and realms beyond. We're getting a family plan today, after I called T-Mobile twice to assure Dad that no, we're not on contract anymore.  I started packing today. I told Wendy that I couldn't go to Third St. since Mom told me it was an early Father's Day lunch, etc. Guilt-tripping galore, so I decided to put all my clothes into a suitcase just to see how much I needed. I need shorts. Bathing suit is probably a little out there since Wendy's going to USC starting Monday and won't be in town for late-night swims with Nimo and maybe a Lydia in something swim-appropriate. It was such a strange feeling. It was cloudy, and the electronic sounds of the Postal Service made it seem almost surreal. Well, at least I'm not taking up as much space as I thought I would...so far.  Peter and Ellis left today. Wendy's going Monday. Ryan's probably coming back soon for UCLA. Andrew's off to Europe Tuesday. I'm leaving Friday. So I guess we've already burned through that blissful week in limbo and we're off to start our real summers.  Mm, I have to go.

      I am not a test score.  I'm just so sick of that "Asian mother" way of seeing things! Everything about your friends is what their parents do or how they did on the SATs and "Are they a good student?" God damnit, it's not like I really get along with people who aren't (here I have to laugh) and I've been like that for 16 whole years. It's just disgusting how one of the first conversational things I hear from Mom when I get home is, "How did Ellis do on his tests?"  Mom, you've got it all wrong. All wrong.  You know what, I worked hard for what I did, but in the end, it's all for me. Sure, I'm happy, but that gives you no right to derive sadistic pleasure into telling everyone else that I did well. I really don't give a damn when it comes to everybody else's reactions and would prefer to hold personal test score information from the Asian mother community. Like at breakfast! There's nothing like pretention to turn somebody off. Can't you please have a civil conversation without mentioning TEST SCORES?  You know, they tell us to get lives. I think they should direct that toward the Asian mothers.   It's just so wrong how people are walking, talking three-digit numbers, all multiples of ten at that. Tiff can't really go out now. Nimo's downed by a ridiculously low 720, imagine that. Ok, so I'm done but so what? It's for personal gratification, and, as an extension of that, a way to keep the parents off my back. I really don't give a shit what other people think about my test scores as long as they leave me alone.  (Abruptly removed from soapbox.) Talking, what else?

      Well, I got bored and drove out looking for used bookstores.   I like Grandma's car, too. It's the petite sedan, which fits my personality better than does the 4runner, which almost suggests burly, rough 17-year-old. Put in the Postal Service. I couldn't figure out how to turn the base down, and so I happily watched the side mirrors vibrate to the tunes. First stop: the Bookaneer. On TO Boulevard, not far past the Auto Mall. It took me forever to turn into the little shopping center. I wonder why there are individual stores on TO. It's so busy it's hard to park, and there's no advantage of anchor tenants or anything. But I digress. It just took a while. I watched the boulevard traffic as the Postal Service played on and I bit my tongue hoping passing cars wouldn't crash into me and oh please, would the traffic let up just for a sec?  Ah, and then the Bookaneer. When I first walked in, I saw a bunch of Penguin titles--the ones with orange and white on the spines. That was "Fiction." I guess I can't particularly complain, it's at least a used bookstore somewhere near, but it wasn't much to look at. The selection was all right, but it wasn't anything that I would pick up and buy. I saw Falling Leaves, haha. The lady in the store had glasses, was listening to Bizet, I think (I remember I played it in orchestra, but I don't quite remember what it is) and was doing cross stitching. There was one shelf devoted wholly to Homer's Odyssey and the Iliad, which was amusing and appalling, simultaneously. There's quite a few Shakespeares. Maybe I'll go back in there when I have to find a Hamlet, that has to be common. I picked up King Lear the last time I went used book shopping. If the sections in the store and the respective quantities of books in them accurately represent what the general reading public digests, I'm pretty disappointed. A lot of romance, western, sci-fi. But I guess that's the stuff that sells. I found Fitzgerald! That was the highlight. The Beautiful and the Damned, a posthumously assembled anthology--The Crack Up, and the standard Gatsby and Tender. I couldn't find This Side of Paradise, though, which was disappointing since I would've bought it. I was tempted to get Crack Up until I realized a lot of it wasn't Fitzgerald. And then I remember a while ago (I think during my CTY summer) a collection of Fitzgerald's letters to his daughter Scottie came out. But now I think, I don't really want to read letters. I'll just rent some Fitzgerald.   So the Bookaneer was ok, but not great, but then again I've never visited a used bookstore that was satisfying. I'm tempted to ask Mom to take me back to the messy one in Camarillo (where I found an excellent new Gatsby for $1 and the owner looked cheated when we brought it up to the register) and sift through all the Jackie Collins and cookbooks and blah blah blah and find something really worth my time. I'd like Leaves of Grass, maybe. I saw Ginsberg today, but I think he's a little too cryptic and nonconformist for me. I brought my book list along but didn't find anything on it today.   I asked the lady at the desk. Ooh, by the way, I think she plays harp or something because behind the desk there was a small harp and a beautiful wooden stand, and also celtic harp CDs. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tiff. Anyways, she said the other store further down TO had closed and A Novel Idea in Agoura was just about to. I ventured down to the other side of TO and went into the Sav-On/Vons shopping center and didn't find anything. I think Jennifer said something about Sav-On and Ralphs. I did see a storefront where the name in lights had been torn out, so I assumed that's where it used to be.  And then I went up Grey Rock once, just for kicks.

      Ahh, life.   I need to find something to do.  It's retarded, my first instinct is to turn to the computer.   Let's see, what is there to do? I could watch a movie. I could, no, I don't want to clean my room or play piano. I can't really catch Saved right now.  Haha, Charlie, you're awesome. AWESOME, YOU HEAR? YESSUH.

      In between a shower and the dishes and the Terminal...  I can't help but smile at what luck I'm having. I'm going to have fun, if I may even call it so, all day long. This is good stuff. I don't know what it is that lets Dad give me the nod for a drive to the beach or Mom to let me go to the movies, but it's wonderful. I'm going away in a week, woo hoo.  There are 183 In-N-Outs listed on their placemat. Just ask Jess.

      I've finally gotten Franz Ferdinand stuck in my head. Little snippets of it, at least.  Well, I think everyone's in a summery, impromptu mood. We went out to dinner tonight. Akio's. It was almost depressing since it's Thursday and there's nearly nobody out. I'm full. I guess it was our way of celebrating. I don't know if it's just Dad's taciturn quality shining in him or if he was just unusually quiet like that. I'm like that too. I wonder if it's equally annoying when I just sit there, quiet, in front of other people.  We saw an accident on the way home. An SUV just flipped over. I couldn't help but feel sad. Everyone was driving at least five miles slower after the accident site. I wonder what people have to do to let that happen to them. Granted, I'm not the most attentive driver, but would that happen to me? That would be a horrible way to suffer, to die.  I need to convince Mom that I'm fit enough to drive to Sycamore Cove tomorrow. Or rather, that the road is fit enough for me to drive on. She's somehow terrified of PCH, though I don't see much difference between that and, say, the 23. I just really want to exercise some measure of independence and go out there myself. I won't show her the mapquest directions though. It says it'll take 42 minutes to go 31.21 miles from my house. Maybe that scares her? Usually Lydia errand trips don't go beyond 15 one way. Mom's decided to be reasonable, fortunately, and will look over a map with me. I better find it first so I can find the best route.   I'm full.

      I'm irritable. I want food, but I bristle at Mom's suggestion of PB and J. I want real food. I want my SAT scores. I don't want to play any more piano.   Haha. I'm too demanding. I might as well find something in the kitchen and read.

      My stomach's up in knots for no particular reason. I got up at 9ish to check Collegeboard. Nothing, but a technical message. I check now. No message, but still nothing. Why does it really matter so much? Maybe because if I do well in math, I'm done. All done. But who cares?  Another piano day. I'm going to have to get going. It's cloudy again. I did the wash, I don't know if it's going to dry in this weather. If luck holds up, I'm driving myself to the beach tomorrow morning. Mom filled the 4runner up, so now I don't have to do it. Yay.  Today's piano pieces: (for you have to map them all out, don't you?) John Harbison's On an Unwritten Letter. I was supposed to go through Mr. Francis's Milennium Piano Book and find something and this was it. At least it didn't require strange percussionistic noises from the depths of the piano. I thought it appropriate, I think in letters too. But it's annoying to play. Completely atonal, and I always want to pretend that I have a key signature. I also can't read ledger lines after...10 years? That, and the Beethoven on page 370. I don't know how I'm going to stay sitting down.

      Trips down memory lane: I went back and read some selected AIM conversations. Some hurt, some made me laugh, some just made me wonder what I was thinking at the time. For some reason, I just get this overwhelming sense that I'm so lucky to have the people I'm with, even though some of the conversations I can't reflect back on and smile. I'm glad they're here, though. It's something to remind me of what I used to be.   I'm glad I don't save them often, either. Some just aren't worth remembering. There are some things in there that just make me hold my breath. Others I scroll down quickly to avoid revisiting awkward details.   I've always been one for intense sentimentality. I don't like to throw away ticket stubs or napkins or little remembrances for fear that oh, that slip of paper touched France with me and to subject that precious item to the dump for all eternity is quite troubling. But seriously. Maybe that's why I always have papers all over the place. I haven't been taking enough pictures, but hopefully now that I actually have the means for putting them on the computer I'll be able to better document visual memories. I remember last summer. I found a stub from Pirates of the Caribbean the other day, and I remember the day we went. I know Katy was there, and so was Lauren. Katy couldn't stop laughing afterwards, and nobody knew why.  And then I think: If Harvard's anything like YSP, life will be good.  I'll be in a nostalgic mood for a while.

      Wow, it's 11 minutes to noon and I have nothing to do today.  Yes, this is today's prevailing atmosphere. Nothingness. Tomorrow I'll have a piano lesson, so I'll practice (logic is beyond me here--I could practice today too but I'm not in the mood). Friday is adopt a beach and meeting Mom's friend's daughter. Saturday...oh, that's Father's Day. My mind doesn't think much past Saturday.   I could watch the movies Dad brought home except the thought of watching Love Actually alone in the dark theatre when it's still light outside (cloudy! my favorite!) is quite disappointing.   Brainstorm session: what do I want to do? I'd rather hold off shopping for necessities until I get to Harvard. I want to read, but for some reason I'm not in the mood. I'm not tired. I've forgotten how nice it is to sleep in. I could start crocheting again, but that's almost too dull to imagine. I just want some official errand to run, I guess.   Argh.

      Well, I got the camera cord. And the software. And a Franz Ferdinand CD in the process.   I now owe Austin $28.14? No, that's not right. $28 something, who cares. I'm in a good mood, don't disturb that.   So I printed pictures, yay!  I daresay, it's almost lunchtime.

      Good morning.   I don't know why I'm blogging so early, but I am so here it is.  Mm, things to do today: find that camera cable. It occurred to me this morning over brushing my teeth that the cord is everything between all those memories: graduation, journalism, etc. and me. I can't print them unless I find that Barnes and Noble bag (I even remember it was a Charlotte's Web one!). I've looked all over the library and a little in my room. Austin was definitely the last person to use it. Would I be stupid enough just to buy another cable? Or a card that prints?   And then volunteer at the hospital. Early. I only hope Isa isn't there or she'd have a cow.  By Thursday, I'll know my SAT scores. That's kind of scary, particularly since I'm not in the school mode right now. I bet they know what I got: they've changed Math 1 and Math 2 to Math 2 and Writing, so they've processed my stuff.  That missing camera stuff is really bothering me. Hm.

      ahahahahahaha.  I'm in a good mood, needless to say.  Making silly plans. I need a bathing suit. Jess, how does J. Crew sound? I like paisley and polka dots. Tell me when you're up for a trip. I really should use the pool this summer. Last summer I went for three months without going in. That was the whole summer. I was an idiot.  I have to wash dishes tonight. Ew.  But Dad's home, so yay.  I need something to do tomorrow morning. No, I'm no isolated loner. Just let me find something to do. How far is Third Street from here? I'm tempted to make the trip alone. But would I spend that much? No. I better sit and think about it. I have the time.   Countdown to SSP: oh, I can't count anymore. (pauses, uses digits) 11 days.  There is something marvelous about a phone call. Any phone call. Someone wants to talk to you!  Did I say I was in a good mood? Yes, I did.   Lydia needs to calm down.  But smiling's always ok.

      I can't help but be somewhat in awe, except I know that's not perfectly rational. It's fun, though. I can only smile.   Making lists again. Movies I want to see: A River Runs Through It Pulp Fiction Big Fish finish Office Space watch all of Sex and the City Kill Bill vol. 1 The Passion Love Actually Girl with the Pearl Earring House of Sand and Fog  I somehow think there's more. Well, hopefully it's something to do in the next 12 days. Twelve days! And I haven't started packing yet. Well, that's normal; to do otherwise would be insanity.   Maybe I need to find that rental packet for Harvard. I wonder if they got my forms.  I guess this is what happens when you let me stay at home for a night.

      Oh help me please. This is truly withdrawal, and of many sorts.  I looked down at my noodle dinner tonight and all of a sudden wished I were at Elephant Bar. My eyes started going dry at 5 this afternoon, so I napped. Before I fell asleep, I realized that the last meal I had at home was on Friday.  Tomorrow's going to be a piano immersion day. I need it.

      Oh, I'm so tired.  But yesterday was the best of days, so I can't complain.  I'm listening to Weezer. I need some sort of noise.  It was exactly like the lady said who was sitting behind us on the tram on the way to the parking structure. A day like that was so good you couldn't top it for the rest of the summer, which makes everything anticlimactic. There's nothing like the happiest place on earth to start off a summer. It was a perfect day, really. It was nice out, not scorching. When we got there at around 9 the lines were unexpectedly short: we tackled the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad first and we just walked through the line, basically. I'm just so glad I got to go back. It's funny that it takes me 16 years to go on those "big" Disneyland rides.  So a final count:  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: 2 times Mr. Toad's Wild Ride (oh, it was wild): 1 teacups: 1, and the cup wouldn't spin. We're getting too big. Nigel said we've all aged. the coaster in Toontown: 1 Splash Mountain: 1, single rider Matterhorn: 2 Honey, I Shrunk the Audience: 1 Star Tours: 1 Haunted Mansion: 1 Pirates of the Caribbean: 1 Indiana Jones: 3, twice illegally  Here I have to laugh. After waiting 45 minutes in the glorious shade the first time, Nige discovers that we can hop the rope and go on again. So we do. Nigel the courageous doesn't think much of it, Ellis laughs. Smirks. All the way in. And then puts on the straight face. The third time we were even more daring and just went through the exit.   We left at 8ish with Ellis. It's goodbye for ten months. Went to the Elephant Bar. Artichoke dip, a mushroom-only sandwich. My first creme brulee. I fell asleep in the car until Mom called asking me where I was.   George Washington warns against entangling alliances. Track 2, Transatlanticism: "You shouldn't think what you're feeling."  Trust me, it was much better in person. I remember I just couldn't stop laughing on some of the rides, it was just fun in the purest sense. I remember yesterday and I remember sunlight and Jackie laughing, all of us laughing...in a weird way, it was a time to refrain from pictures so that all those memories remained in your head the way they're supposed to. It was so worth it.   Today: beach cleanup at Leo Carillo. Charlie and Enid went nuts. We were resting in the mural tunnel when all of a sudden I spied at least 10 beer bottles resting on the ledge above us. Jess happily put all of them in a bag, the bottles clinking so loud they broke. We couldn't find Enid for a while, who eventually discovered that elusive cave and fell asleep when she realized Charlie and I had lost her. Splashing in the waves. Neptune's afterward. I now know what clam strips are. Mom called me at 10ish: "You just went out yesterday!" But honestly, what would I do at home? Entertain her by sitting around with a book? Setting the table? I hope it occurs to her soon enough that it's summer, I'm home to annoy her for two weeks and only two weeks and she might as well suck it up. Ow. That wasn't nice.  "Nazis invented the window-lock."  I'm just so content right now. I'm sitting here, feet sandy and still in my volunteer shirt and everything. I was itching to blog all the way home. I wouldn't mind if I just spent the rest of the afternoon reading. And thinking. Or planning more grand adventures.

      Oh wow. I just finished Leif Enger's Peace Like A River.  For one fleeting second, I thought Reuben had died too and that we were wandering into the literary territory of the life in heaven stories, like The Lovely Bones. Jape Waltzer almost reminds me of the assassin in my dream. I am warmed with the stories of miracles, and see this as a very Kylan-esque book with the message that God is comforting. Reuben's dad shouldn't have died, but I suppose that's part of the miracle. Marrying Sara, I thought, was a hasty deus ex machina, but it was the anticlimax by then anyways. I'm glad Davy got away, but I remember that this whole thing started because of Davy's girl Dolly, and I somehow sensed that it didn't matter anymore. Enger is a master storyteller.  In other news, I had the worst dream in years last night. Perhaps I've been exposed to too many fictional accounts of assassins and killings, etc. but my dream last night was that they were killing off the Asian girls at school, and their families. I think that part came from the Kaiser in the Usual Suspects. I just lived in unusual fear. I won't relate some of the more disconcerting details, but the killer was a student at school, but nobody knew who he was. He had a gun. He even came into journalism and shot at people, but miraculously nobody was hurt. Nobody wanted to be around me since my family was getting killed off and they thought if I was near them, they could catch a stray bullet. It was bizarre. I awoke at 4:49 am and all I could see was the glow of the early morning sky peeking out from under the blinds. Without my glasses on, I could have sworn there was someone in the window. I imagined that he had a gun and was about to shoot me. To make things worse, the house creaked. You know, those normal noises that you just hear when the house is silent. So finally, I couldn't take this suspension in fear and went to grandma's room to sleep for two more hours. When I awoke, I realized how silly it was and how effective night and silence were in heightening my fears.  Last day of school today, thank goodness.  What's this story about Peter getting handcuffed at gunpoint?  It was Austin's promotion today. The little kid is amazingly apathetic. We couldn't find him for a while. Saw Mrs. B and Amanda and Coral, though.  I'll do more reading over the summer.

      The good outweighs the bad, but...  1. Barbara, according to Jackie, is angry that we didn't invite her to Disneyland. What, does she think I invite random rude people along? That was mean.  2. We were handing out roses as everyone was heading out to the parking lot, and we're giving out three. This girl takes about 7 home. Maybe more. We gave her a very generous bunch. And then she turns around as if she's going to come and get more, and she does. She doesn't really seem secure about herself. I've seen her around, it's more ostentatious displays of "fitting in."  I'm not very nice, aren't I?  But today was a good day. I'll shush now.

      I witnessed my first WHS graduation today.  No, I didn't cry, but I was tempted to. In the midst of such finality and ceremony all I could do was stare at the sea of blue robes and sigh. I know some awesome people in there. And I just had to think, that's going to be me in a year. 365 days, Nigel emphasized.  So thanks Jean, for the good times. I love you so much, you're simply awesome. Sylvia, you are my hero. Pegleg, Keira, Brandon, Amanda, Greg, Coral and Melody, the back row in journalism will never be the same again. Parshaw, my Thursday buddy, dinnertime won't be as entertaining without you. Chika, we love Mr. Francis.  I just can't believe they're gone, you know? They haven't been in classes for a while, but they've popped up every so often. I don't know. It's just that my memory remembers them there and my perception of reality has yet to catch up.  So it's the first stage of grief: denial.  When I think about growing up and being a senior, I have to stop. I don't know, I don't approach it with the exuberance or the anticipation that others do. For one, I can't say I'm a senior until September 2, I just can't. That's when it's inevitable. But now. The seniors will always be seniors where it matters. They're just so much to live up to. They've been my role models, my friends, my rides home, hah...I just don't think I'm worthy of filling that role, of mentoring someone else. Journalism is a fine example. Without everyone, the room is empty. There's no laughter, really, no secret Super Mario, no funny Photoshop exploits, no jokes or teasing. I can't carry that weight on my shoulders.   It goes without saying that this is the class that I've become closest to besides my own.   And I think, that's going to be us next year. I'll wear a lei and have sashes around my neck. I'll be taking pictures, I'll be crying with friends. I'll see all my teachers and thank them for all they've taught me, both in and out of school. I'll go to grad nite, and come back for breakfast. And then I'll leave the bubble, the Westlake bubble.   A good argument for taking it slow.  I love Mrs. B. Sometimes I'm almost afraid I'm bugging her, but today after school we talked college and books. She gave me her SN, which made me laugh because she had one in the first place, and also since both of ours were inspired by literature. I don't think I've ever been that close to an adult outside of the family structure. Well, one more year.  One more year. What will I think in 365 days?

      I am a penitent soul.  I went into the garage just now. I saw that yes, there was a silver smear on the side of the Odyssey, removable, but a telltale sign of a dent. I change the viewing angle and see that it's not the same anymore. I try to rub the black off the 4runner, but it doesn't come off. I think the black is the underlying plastic and the silver is the paint.  I stood where Mom's beloved usually rests and I imagine the intersection of the trusty minivan and my silver giant, if you will.  I sigh.  If anything, I'm glad that it happened to the van instead of some stranger's car. But Mom shouldn't have parked that close, and I shouldn't have backed out so carelessly. I just put the car into reverse and the next thing I heard was the mirror closing on the Odyssey. It isn't that major. I don't see any reason for either car to be fixed, and the Odyssey's damage is less visible than the 4runner's, which hopefully placates Mom in some demented sense.  I saw her get out of the car at the gate yesterday, when we left together, her in the van. She looked at the side and got back in. She didn't yell at me or anything. She even waved to me at the intersection. She didn't bring it up all of last night, was happily showing me things to eat after I got home.   And then it all slams on me. Today.  Let me put the big picture together for you.   Driving to get Austin after school today, I was like, hey this is nice. I should have something to do like this every day after school of finals week. I'm going to graduation Thursday, but Friday. Ah, Friday. I should do something.  And then I come home. The movie's about to go on when Mom calls and starts yelling at me. The charges: 1. I should be studying during finals week. She came in this morning before 7 to make sure that I didn't have to be at school at the regular time and then proceeded to tell me that maybe the movie and lunch weren't such a good idea. I persuaded her otherwise. I don't think she believed me. She said I should save fun for after school ends. Little does she know, I have Disneyland in my arsenal. Now that I think about it, Boston's going to be endless fun too.  2. I shouldn't have been driving Nimo home from the Promenade. Oh, it was such a bad fake, and I'm a bad thinker in the heat of the moment. The phone rings, Nimo picks up. I don't know who it is except I have an inkling that it's mom since caller ID says it's from "unknown." Mom wants to speak to me and I tell Nimo to tell her that I'M DRIVING. Mom proceeds to lecture me how much a human life costs in the United States. She tells me I have to turn in my keys after school every day or else she's going to have to start driving me to school. Well, the fact that school's almots over is on my side. But I still like to have the keys in my pocket as some measure of "autonomy" and "independence."   3. My friends were still over at 10 minutes to 4. I'd estimated that I'd be done by 4, but then I had to pick up Austin, which took up 40 minutes. Well, even then it would've been closer to 5. I know she doesn't like so many people over all of a sudden. There were...let me see...nine people. I know Grandma isn't happy for sure. I can't blame that one on anyone.  4. And the car thing. So she found out.  I don't know how to make it up to her, except that I am really sorry for some of the things. The car, for one, bugs me the most. That, and driving Nimo. I cleaned up after my friends left, so hopefully no mess will remind her that they ever visited. I don't see why she's so anal about finals. I'll do extra chores or anything, I just want to keep the keys.   It's a nominal thing, those keys. I'm not going to go anywhere without her permission (usually) but I don't like the inflexibility of asking her for them every time I have to go somewhere. I'm too sorry to lie to her. I just wish she'd understand that I don't have major finals work and that I just want to relax for a bit.  Life goes on, doesn't it?

      I don't know what to do at this hour but sit here with my chin on the spine of my math book and type away. I'm done, I really think I am.  My brother's listening away to the Beatles. "Love me, love me..." Oh I need you baby. I think I missed out on that part of American pop culture.  I think it's too early to resign to bed. I won't think so next morning when I have to get up. I wonder if I'll have to compete for parking spots tomorrow since it starts at 8 for everyone. Well, I'm hoping there's seniors who park in the lot too; they won't be there tomorrow morning.   I'm happily bored, I guess you could say. I might want to find that NHS form and turn it in, but I'm not that ready for real work.   Just let school be over, please.

      I saw a beautiful, singular white bird on the road today. Long-legged. I've seen it before: this morning, across the street at the pond. I see roadkill too. I hope those two concepts never connect.  I'm bothered by roadkill somehow. Austin delights in it. We have a snake on Lakeview at present. I won't forget the first time I saw a dead snake on the road: there were insects climbing all over it. The more I drive, the more I see. I console myself, it's natural! But is it? It isn't.  I saw a license plate that had something off-centered. It bothered me somehow, sitting at the intersection.  I couldn't concentrate in piano today. Everything was just noise in the afternoon: the Spanish music playing for the cleaners, their laughter, the vacuum, doors, the television.  Well, I know when I'm tutoring now. 7:30 and then 2-4 on Thursday. I hope I'll be able to help, I'm rusty on Algebra 2. Well, not rusty. I just don't know enough math above it to do well.   I have vocab to do. It's a blah day. Cloudy, though, which is nice. Which would be nice if I weren't so tired to start with.

      I'm so tired I have a headache.  I forgot where I put down times for tutoring but I know I have one today after piano and then another on Wednesday, I think. I don't remember who's coming today. Or when. That sucks. I hope it's Kaitlin today so I can at least ask her mom what time Wednesday is.  I somehow am missing 12 points on homework in math. I wonder how that happened. Well, I have to get 97 points on the final, or a 70-ish percent to keep the A. I hope it's easy. I'm slumping second semester. Edline ranks me as fifth in math, second in English. But I've stopped caring, so everything's a-ok.  Amherst is paying for 200 minority students to visit for a weekend. I'm applying, though getting test scores together will be a bummer. I'm too tired for that kind of stuff, though free plane tickets, housing, a look at Amherst sounds interesting. I wonder if I'll get it.   I wonder what there is for lunch.  There's four Mexican cleaners at our house. $300 for the day. I think, that's a lot of money, but then again, that's their whole day, so $75 a day. If they worked for 10 hours, that would be minimum wage, but I doubt it. So a little over minimum. I wonder why I even care. My room is cleaner than it was in a long time, though my birthday stuff in the corner has been removed.  Oh, I wonder if I have to call collegeboard about taking writing in place of the math 1. Maybe.  Forgive me, I'm out of it.

      Oh, and I sat next to Josh Hill (remember him?) during the SATs today. I didn't recognize him at all, even when he said "bless you." Only when he asked me if I went to Colina did I realize it was him. He seems to have sobered up a bit. I remember he was absolutely hilarious in eighth grade. A nice kid. I hope I run into him again.

      I have that Weezer sweater song stuck in my head. Thanks, Nimo.  I want to just sit here and think. It's been a productive day, if productivity is measured in happiness. It's about 9:30. I have a slight stomachache. Almost tired. Have an unfinished email that goes practically nowhere, I don't think I want to send it except that I know that if I don't, I'm not going to get anything back. I'll just recline slightly...  Ow, stomach really hurts now.  At 9:33 pm on an unusually warm Saturday night, I'm meditating on relationships. Whatever memories I have are so dissimilar to what Nimo tells Wendy and me about his own experiences, so I ask myself, what did I spend all my time on? My memories: talking, writing. Laughing, but mainly at someone else's joke. A journal. A book.  Today I realize: Lydia, that's nothing. Really nothing at all. Things like this aren't forcefully defined, they just happen. I think I put too much into it, or I tried too hard. It's just that I don't really have anything cute, if I may, left over from it. It was just feeling secure, I guess, for a new and novel reason. I guess it was somewhere in between too: I can't deny that I cried sometimes over the things he wrote, and I don't do that kind of silly lachrymose stuff for friends, just friends.  It was a funny, terrible nothing. I'll learn.  Watched Seven with Wendy and Nimo. I was walking up the back stairs and kept checking behind my back to make sure that no, there was no delusional Kevin Spacey following me. The movie is an argument for how things simply work better when there's a central theme, but that concept often goes sour when one tries to employ it effectively in the course of a 1-hour ICE. I love how it was so intellectual, so meticulous, so planned. That red neon cross still scares me a bit.  Ahh, I can't get Weezer unstuck.  I had a good day.   I don't want to finish this email.  Harvard is in three weeks.  Please don't have me deal with "bossy woman" (according to Hank) tomorrow.  I'm tired.

      Mood swings like none other.   I just got an email back from him. So I sigh relief.  But before that, I left my camera at the restaurant, so I had to race back. Upon coming home, Mom tells me someone called but forgets the name. I end up bothering Mrs. Battaglia at 10:30pm before calling Mrs. Burkett. I'm so sorry for bothering Mrs. B.   And then even before that, I was sad.   Wait, no, even now. The email was unpromisingly glib. It quoted me. I hate that.  Oh I feel like cussing right now, haha. Roller coaster like none other. I don't feel like explaining. I have Leni Fe Friday, SATIIs Saturday, got roundly yelled at, am going to have to explain to Dad why there's $85 at Tuscany on his credit card, had to say goodbye to Dad today, have Spanish hw, realized I might not ever see people like Pegleg and co. ever again, and I bothered Mrs. Battaglia.  For a few hours at dinner, I forgot that I was troubled, and now it's all coming back to me. I've reclaimed it by coming home. Dad isn't going to be here for two weeks. Piano competition. SATIIs. Making people happy. Making myself happy.   I don't know, maybe all I need now is someone to talk to.

      Sad for some particular reason that I can't particularly pinpoint.   I've practiced some piano, at least. Oh, what else do I have to do? Get plates, forks and napkins. Ready the camera. Do Spanish homework. I hate Spanish, and I think Bruckner knows it too. She picks on me because I don't speak up much. I guess my participation in a class is dependent on how much I respect the teacher or the curriculum. I don't like this nuestra ciudad feel. I'd much rather read stories.  Maybe I'm sad because Austin's playing Dashboard Confessional in the background.  Or maybe it's because I keep on checking my email and there's nothing there. Well, what could I expect? I've been tempted all day to write again, but that's repeating ugly history and I'm not going to resign to those tactics. What did I ever want from this? I don't even know, but whenever I really talk about it I'm edgy and bitter. And now I'm forlorn. What the hell. The problem is that I never decided. I still haven't.  I'm angry that the yearbooks aren't out yet. They said last Friday, then today, and now Thursday. Word is that someone inserted porn and now they have to fix it somehow. I'm tempted to cuss those people out because the rest of the school ends up paying more than $50 a pop for those books riddled with bad grammar. No, I'm tempted to write an editorial. But it's simply annoying since tomorrow's the last day for the journalism seniors and unless I hunt them down, they won't be able to sign my yearbook. Tomorrow we're having our mock trial dinner, and unless I hunt down some of the people, I won't see them again for a long, long time.  I conducted the critique in journalism today. Scary thought. They don't respect me yet, but that's ok.  If I press   a few more times...

      Anticlimax.  After hearing the Brahms Society Orchestra play, everything else seems so profane. I'm beginning to experience pangs of guilt for not practicing  at all  for these five weeks. What a story I have for Mr. Francis. And I wonder why I quit violin, or what I look like when I play in Conejo. There were some who just sat there, legs spread, disinterestedly playing away when others were so into it I swore they closed their eyes. I'm tempted to go practice tomorrow.  You know, that's about everything I have in my head right now.  Oh, and I'm hungry, though it's senseless to go out and get food. Food costs money. I wonder how I could go through so much in five weeks.  I think I might be getting sick.

      It's beastly hot out today.  Jenn and Matt and I walked the Freedom Trail, or as far as we wished to go...we made it all the way across the river to Charlestown and then gave up and took the T home. I don't understand this weather: two days ago it was raining and I was more than comfortable in pants and a long-sleeved shirt. Today, I just want to hop in the shower. I will, after this.  Damnit, one of my roommates just got in the shower.  I guess this tour is just one of those things you have to do when you're in Boston. It took us five weeks to get around to it, and even so, we didn't cover the whole thing. It's funny...by the time we got across the river, we didn't really see anyone else. We snapped faraway pictures of the Bunker Hill Memorial and the USS Constitution and desperately decided to find the next T stop.  But yeah. I'm just really, really hot and sweaty. Ew.  Tomorrow's going to be August.  Wow.

      It turns out the paper is  not  due this weekend, but in another two weeks.  That's a miracle, really. You beg yourself, some divine power, to intervene and just  do  something to alleviate the pain, and here it is.  Oh happy day. Nabokov is intresting.

      Wow, it's almost the end of July. It's hard to think that I spent my whole entire month here. But tallying everything up, I've spent 17 weeks my whole entire life away from home, away from the family. It shouldn't be that bad...that's about 4 months.  Someone else in Pennypacker also has Room on Fire and was playing it as I was sitting outside on the phone last night. Yay. I have random songs stuck in my head every so often.  I keep on looking in the mirror and swearing that I don't look awake.  But I am. And now that I am, I've had some time to reflect on things as they are. It's just so weird. I guess deep down I  was  expecting him to come, and now that he's not going to be here anytime soon, it's kind of weird. I wouldn't say that his not coming leaves a void, but still. I feel like I've almost been cheated out of something. That expectation, at least. I know it was really too much to ask for him to come all the way over here, on standby flights, and just give him a hell of a time trying to catch a plane, and I guess it's better that he knew last night that he couldn't make it instead of being at the airport right now and discovering that a trip to Boston wasn't a possibility. But it would have been something monumental if he showed up. Something to talk about for a long time after.  "I'm not your friend, I never was." -- Automatic Stop.  Oh, how I love that song. I'm playing it as loud as I can without disturbing anyone.  Ishita's going home today, and Sarah's going home next weekend. Maybe all I can say is that I'm glad that I don't have to go home...it would be so weird seeing everyone and then not. It's like tempting you to rush to the end, and I don't want to have to do that.  "Give me some time, I just need a little time." -- You Talk Way Too Much   Someone's playing the Schumann tomorrow night in a concert. The Brahms Society Orchestra. I should go, shouldn't I?

      He's not coming.   I found out at 6am and then went back to sleep, all the while thinking, "Is this real?" It almost seemed real enough with him coming. And now the real reality is that he isn't.  Well, mystery solved. I have a paper to write this weekend.  Sigh.

      I'm really tired. Again.  Class is losing more and more flavor. We got a whole entire lecture on Rwanda and Burundi from eight pages of reading. I almost feel bad for the professor--people were falling asleep. I did my best to stay awake, but it made me wonder, what do I look like when I nod off in class? Lit I just couldn't absorb anything, really. Day by day I feel worse about not  saying  something in class, but then again, I try to comfort myself by reminding myself that when I get home, maybe I'll have something to say. Maybe.  I wonder, how do people find the one thing that they absolutely love? For me, it might be journalism; I just get sucked in. Or mock trial. It's definitely not something science. How long does one have to go searching before they hit something good?  Charlie and Jenn are going to Dartmouth tomorrow at 6:30 am. Unless I want to spend some good quality time with Matt and Adam and Aaron, I think I'll have the day mostly to myself.  I still have the paper to write.  I'm so tired.

It's raining outside. Be thankful you have that nice CA weather. We walked back from CVS in drizzle and dodged puddles.  I love this music.  I wonder if he's coming Friday.

      I almost fell asleep reading, leaning backwards in the chair. Perhaps this will wake me up a bit. I just don't understand why this anthro reading is so slow. It's not like I don't find it interesting, but it just takes a while.  Listening to the Strokes. Yay.  I have nothing deep and profound to say. I think I'm going to run over to Baskin Robbins tomorrow and get a gift certificate for Nige, then go to the Gap to return something (petty, frivolous chore), then to the post office to send off Ellis's package to Jessica and Nigel's card. My big brother's growing up! Aw. I'll probably make a trip to CVS tonight to get a card. I'm just thinking, do I want to wake up that early to get things done, or should I just wait until Friday?  Oops, I was supposed to go to Tozzer today, and I completely forgot. I have anthro reading to do anyways.  I love it when nobody else is in the room and I can turn on/off the lights as I want, scrap the headphones and turn off the fan. I'm curious to know what the roommates think of me. Oh, that Lydia, she listens to music too loud all the time, doesn't take her stuff out of the shower after she's done, doesn't make her bed, has the messiest desk in the dorm...  I can't believe how fast SSP has gone by.   I want to look forward to this weekend, but I have the paper to write too. Where does all my time go? I went to breakfast this morning, came back and kind of did work on the tutorial, went to lunch and came back and read, went to get smoothies, read, dinner, reading...ew, it's 6:37 already. And even worse, I'm tired.  This Strokes CD isn't as good as the first one. Same with Death Cab. Well, I have time to enjoy them. It's going to be such driving music when I get home. I've forgotten how to drive, probably--how weird is it to drive for one month on a license exactly, go away for two and then come back? When my six months are up, it won't really be six months of driving under my belt but four. I can't even imagine myself driving and wonder how I could've managed to do something that seems so difficult. But I miss my freedom.  To work.

I don't know how I'm to deal with waking up on a regular schoolday.  I got an email back. Hm.  You know what, I'm just going to stop typing and wake up, maybe.

      It's past 8:30, so I think Charlie and Mark might've forgotten to knock on my door before they went to Wendys. That's ok, I think I'll have to force myself to start brainstorming about the paper tonight and do away with the the drama.  Charlie had better wash my Cal sweatshirt. He wore it all day yesterday, and it probably didn't cover his navel except he had another shirt on. Hood on too, of course. Except he just notified me when he came to get the detergent that he'd sneezed on it...  Charlie and Jenn and Matt saw Clinton today, in the flesh, in Harvard Square. I wish I was there, but I was in class. Matt told Clinton to "go screw himself." Asshole. Bigot. I can't believe some of the things he says sometimes, and with nothing substantial to support his arguments. But I got a 90 on my midterm. I wonder if that's good or not...I hope it is. I found my blue book at the bottom of the pile...does he rank by performance in book order? At least it's an A. I can't complain. I should go over to Tozzer tomorrow to start researching topics, and then make an appointment with Prof Macdonald.  I'm not going to Wendy's. Charlie just called...and I figured I don't want to go.  Why does this paper seem so awfully unappealing?

      Serving up yet another dish of drama.  I have to go soon since I still have 15 pages of anthro reading to do within the hour. I just don't know what to do with that email.  I had a really weird dream last night. There was a 74-storey building and I was in a race to see who could run up every flight, circle the floor and go up one more, etc. I think when I woke up I was still stuck on the 30s. Every single time the alarm clock went off, I shut it up and went back to dreaming about climbing stairs.

      Wow.  I think I got back to Pennypacker at 2:30 and only now have I gotten my fill of this blessed thing called the internet.  It's really funny how a few days offline can really affect your sanity. I started waking up in the mornings feeling lost. I didn't  talk  to people enough, which is weird, since I know people here and everything. I'm grateful that they fixed it without cost. They just stuck a wireless card in and then stuck my card in and voila! it worked. Funny business.

      Two minutes until midnight, and all I can think of is that it's really sticky and I need to shower tomorrow morning.   It's nice that I've constantly had something to do today.  After staying up late for  Shawshank  last night, we followed it up by boarding a bus to Brown at 9.&nbsp;I guess they decided to actually split us into groups this time by bus following the general chaos of the Yale trip, so I ended up on bus three with nobody I knew. But I think I learned weird lessons today. A good weird, since I wouldn't have learned them elsewhere.  Sitting in front of me on the bus were the two proctors, S and D. At first sight, S didn't seem like a typical Harvard girl, but as I accidentally listened to more and more of the conversation (hey, I honestly made a conscious effort to turn up the CD player so I couldn't hear them, but I started falling asleep and bits of their conversation drifted into my dreams. First thing: life isn't a breeze once you get into Harvard. On the contrary, it's brutal, and it's going to take some time to realize that you're not at the top of your class anymore.   I think that in itself is enough to deal with, chew on, ruminate for a while.  I've become too comfortable, really. To me, everything's just too simple and there's not enough work involved in getting to the top. It's the high school bubble. Even struggling for a thesis (which I cringe at every time I look back at it) is pain enough, so how does one deal with this kind of downgrading of the self with four classes a semester? Despite talks of grade inflation, I really don't think it's going to be that easy. I really should start enjoying high school more, since it's definitely not going to last.  The second point just freaks me out a bit--S has already set a wedding date for April 23, 2006. I'm assuming she's going to be a college senior next year. Still, it seems a bit weird to me. Here's someone who's still in school and already knows when she's getting married. The two just started talking about relationships, etc. Have we all run so short of time? What is this? I'm 16 right now and I really don't care sometimes.  As for Brown, it's nice, but it's not my top-choice school. I don't hate it at all, but I just don't see the attraction of paying Ivy tuition--after all, it  is  Brown--when I could be equally happier or better at Cal or something. Rhode Island is just really, really small. Apparently, you can pay $1.25 for bus fare and get  anywhere  in RI, which is insane--imagine doing that in California! The part of Providence that's close to Brown is very quaint, very bohemian. As usual, you have your Urban Outfitters and your Gap, but there's also some very strange shops that we walked into that smelled simply old and had handwritten signs, etc. The campus wasn't particularly impressive except for the Marcus Aurelius statue (see the picture) but then again, little can compare with the majesty (and don't refute me here!) of Harvard. Even their piddling little yard was nothing compared to here. Their bookstore was nothing like the Coop (though I only saw the first floor) and they sold random toys and gewgaws that had  nothing &nbsp;to do with Brown, so that kind of creeped me out a&nbsp;bit. I  did  manage to get a remainder copy of  The French Lieutenant's Woman , &nbsp; though, which Mrs. B suggested. The only thing that made it sound better, though, was the tour given by the tour guides...they were just really upbeat, even though the campus isn't that impressive. Their 8-year med program only takes 60 students out of a pool of 1,300. Daunting.  We got back just in time to hear Ralph Nader speak in the Science Center. Well, part of it was Nader's speech. The beginning part was just local people speaking on behalf of their causes: anti-war, labor unions, the situation in Colombia (this one was interesting...I actually tried to listen to it in original Spanish). There was this one woman (girl?) who was dressed so informally I could have met her on the street and wouldn't have thought that this person was running for the Massachusetts state representative. She came up to speak in a tank top and a skirt, and I could see her flip-flopped foot with the toes pressing to the ground as she fidgeted at the podium. She's apparently running because nobody else is, but Jenn pointed out that she never talked about her platform...weird.  It was just really inspiring to hear Nader speak, though I will still not take a stand in politics. Kill me if you must, but that stuff just doesn't interest me. Perhaps it's another side effect of living in a bubble. He was very anti-capitalism...Zach called him a "watermelon:" green on the outside, red on the inside. I guess he made a point about not having to choose between the lesser of two evils (Kerry and Bush) but I didn't really get much out of it in terms of political ideology. I think I just went because I could snap pictures (I think Charlie mocks me for taking so many) and just be able to tell people that I saw Nader. That celebrity appeal. At the very end, one of his campaign workers came up to the podium and asked for a "hero" to donate $1,000, which struck me as very very weird. One guy gave $500 and another $100. So much for one cause? I guess either your money comes and goes very easily or you believe fervently in the cause. I just can't get over the fact that wow, this guy is constantly on national television and is the figurehead for the third-party opposition (again, don't yell at me if you disagree) but that was it. Just the sheer thrill. I felt bad for Dad during his anti-capitalist talks, and wondered to what I could credit much of my comfort...  And then dinner, and AIM, and  Kill Bill vol. 1  and here I am again. Though it's time to sign off since I'm getting tired--good night.  Then we came back and saw Ralph Nader speak in the science center, hence, the pictures.

      It's almost 2am over here and my strongest impression is that there's this guy, Stephen, sitting on the steps on the first floor because his friends are going through his food and putting some sort of laxative in it to pay back for the shaving cream incident. He walked up to Charlie one day and drank all of his chocolate milk. He's surprisingly calm.  We're going to Brown tomorrow. More early mornings, ugh.  I just watched  The Shawshank Redemption.  Mighty good.  Somehow, everything seems to be all right again. Friends are just that magical.  Do I really want a relationship right now? It's one of those honest questions that you never dare ask yourself for fear of seeming shallow or scatterbrained or anything like that. Besides, the possibility becomes more and more remote by the day. We go back to the fact that I, in a strange way, am only attracted to people who don't know how to date.  And it's late. What kind of discussion is this anyway?

      For some reason, I always need to check my email or write in the blog before I start studying. Maybe it's ritual. Maybe it's one last goodbye to normal life for a&nbsp;moment.   I can't believe that by this Saturday, I will have been here for one month. Even more incredible, I have one more month to go after Saturday. I remember that by this time in YSP, we probably would've gone camping and hiking, and we're scrambling for paper outlines and drafts. I'm not homesick, but one month...well, this one month has passed by in a breeze, and by the last week I know I won't want to leave.  I've been thinking how horrible it must be to be named Caprice. Hi, we didn't really want you but on a whim we had you...

      I think I've made some progress since I got back from CVS. It felt good to actually shower and know that you had a workable bandaid waiting outside for you. In this sense, Jenn and I are twins--we both chafed our feet miserably on shoes we wore for the Harvard interview. It's really disgusting: on the outside of my left foot at shoe-top level there's this miserable blister or whatnot that's not too clean right now, and I don't know what to do with it. I should've worn socks. At any rate, my foot's not going to see the inside of a shoe for a while.  I've never really disliked a Christian, but maybe Matt comes close. It's just that he'll be so irreverent and ignorant and un-Christian for a good while, but then he tells you that he's been praying for you and that kind of puts you off. Then again, I don't know many Christians who are openly Christian...  I've rediscovered the Chopin waltzes, and they are wonderful. Thank you, Artur Rubenstein, you play lovely study music.  I'm still wondering why I got annoyed at anthropology today. Jess, isn't that the name of a store on Third St.? That just crossed my mind today.  After almost four weeks, I still have to marvel at the fact that I get along with Jenn so well. I'm just happy to have her here: I caught her on the way back from screenwriting tonight and we walked over to CVS together. I don't think our moms realized how similar we were when they decided that we should meet before SSP.  I'm kind of looking forward to Sunday alone. I'll have time to re-read Woolf, maybe, and think of a decent thesis this time. I've actually "started" a paper by putting in the heading, but I still have yet to put anything material in its body.  For some reason, the non-students living among us really interest me. Apparently, there's an apartment in the basement of Hurlbut, and every day I can see a desk, a warm light and a bookshelf. Sometimes a cat, at which Charlie will swoon. When the shades are up, I can see a kitchen: dangling pots and pans and a Rosie the Riveter poster: We can do it! There's also someone living right below us in 15--next door to Charlie and Co. When I walk by on Ware St. I can totally tell it's a home, since you can see cacti in the window and in the next, you see the fan from 16. I was similarly interested to hear that Yale house masters live in the colleges with the kids, year-round.  Enough of this. More studying and Chopin.

      It's really, really hot in here despite the fact that I'm wearing less and less clothing.  Maybe this is contributing to my fatigue: five minutes before 9 this morning I scrawled a hasty "I can't go to breakfast message" and taped it to the guys' door. Jenn came in at a bit past 10 and handed me a blueberry muffin, yay. To that stash, we've added a brownie and a sugar cookie. It's too hot to be hungry, though. I almost fell asleep in Lamont and decided to go to Starbucks for coffee to keep me up, but I fell asleep again when I got back to the dorms.  The anthro midterm is tomorrow. I'm reading the article on slash and burn again, though I don't know how much of all these minute details I'll have to know for the test. It's a few ID questions, one short essay and one long essay--how bad could it be? But then again, essays are only good when they have a lot of fact backing up a claim. The positivist approach. I just want to prove myself somehow and show the professor that yes, I have a brain and yes, I can use it. So I'll go back reading. There's that one religion article that never sticks in my head...and I think I'll go flipping through the notes and  Highland Burma , just to be sure.  I suppose the most difficult part about classes and actual work in those classes is that one, you don't know what the teachers expect of you and that two, they don't know what you're capable of. So on your end, you're left guessing at what the test will be like, and on theirs, they'll think you're absolutely mediocre (or worse) until you come up with something brilliant. This isn't high school anymore.  I have whole bunch of clothes piled on top of my dresser...perhaps it'll be wise to clean it off? I also share the bed with a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, and a few random shirts. It's just like back home, except the bed is smaller so I can feel the foreign objects more keenly.   I just might be tired of Death Cab, but I have nothing else to replace it. I found a Tower Records on the other side of The Garage, so maybe I'll go visit sometime. Any suggestions? Is Modest Mouse any good? Or the other Death Cab CD's?

      I'm really tired for some reason. It's not even like I went to bed too late (the last time I looked at the clock it was 12:48 am over here) and it's not like I'm doing strenuous exercise every day. Nonetheless, I just got up from a nap, and it's back to reading.  I don't know if dissatisfaction's the word, but anthro gets more sluggish and unfulfilling every day. Or maybe it's simply because I haven't been putting in what I should be putting in. The midterm's tomorrow, and I realized, while sitting at a worktable at Lamont, that it's really not that bad: there's going to be ID questions, one short essay and one long one. I guess I just have to find the major themes and write about them...I might want to start on myth, culture and ritual. I just really want to do well to get myself some sort of comfortable footing in this class, but somehow I'm just so darn tired too.   In an effort to keep myself awake (mission aborted), I have discovered that coffee frappuccinos are good.  And it's time for dinner. Only more studying lies ahead. That, and Kafka reading. Sigh.

      Sigh. &nbsp; Sometimes, the longer I'm here, the more I realize I'm never going to be one of those academics that everyone else really looks up to, like "Whoa, they're smart." I almost can't stand to look at Beth anymore after struggling so much with the paper, and I saw her handle the whole pile, which probably means that she's going to be reading them, so when she gets around to mine, she'll know more than she should of my thought processes. There are just some people in that class who are constantly more insightful than I am, quite apparent when they speak up in class, and that probably translates to more insightful papers. Unlike mine. It's just annoying, since I loved the class until we got to the paper. I thought hey, maybe psych won't have to be that great since lit will be, and I'll enjoy it--enjoy it meaning I like the material, and I'm good at it. But obviously, that's not the case. &nbsp; And that's just lit to start with.  &nbsp; Anthro's all right except I only got a check on my second response paper, which I got back today. The last one I got a check-plus-plus (here I start laughing) and savored a little secret joy for the whole entire week. Apparently, I got a little too complacent...or formulaic? Jenn came up with this theory of how the second check on the first paper could carry over and I'd even it out...though I doubt it works that way. I get the impression that either the professor isn't stellar, or we (the students) aren't. Maybe it's a combination of both. He's a mild Ballard case: he'll go off telling stories of his field work in the Amazon, which is perfectly fine but then again I have to wonder the significance of even being a corporeal form in William James Hall at 1 on Tuesdays and Thursdays: the final is all based on stuff on handouts and in the books. And we're not that brilliant either. Either the adults go off on pseudo-intelligent topics or the kids are just lost. Or we're all too timid, generally. &nbsp; More and more I've come to think that I only enjoy things when I'm good at them. Attraction and success are simultaneous and have to be instantaneous...life is just too hard not doing well.  &nbsp; So as I was walking back from Annenberg, I was seriously considering USC, as lame as that sounds. Harvard's still my dream school and will always be, but how much of a dream will it be when I get in and have to suffer the kind of academic strain that I saw in Vicky Ho? Won't life be easier in a school where the SAT average is probably in the 1300s? Would the prospect be sweetened by the 8-year baccalaureate/med program? &nbsp; The only thing that honestly buoys me up is the company of friends. I almost completely forgot about that troublesome essay last night when we were just hanging out in 16, half reading and half laughing and yelling and eating microwaved cookies. Except I have to go back on the reading now and take careful notes. Jenn and Charlie and Matt won't be here on Sunday, which really makes me wonder what I'm going to do. Read Kafka? Anthro? Wander around and shop? &nbsp; It's just this feeling that I just can't shake off. But as persistent as it may sound, I still walk around as if I'm in some sort of depressing daze, as if I  don't &nbsp;want to shake it off.

      I'm "done" with the paper, which means I'm really not completely satisfied with it but what the hell, I think it's enough obsessing and there's not much I can do now. &nbsp; I just feel like I'm in limbo. Part of me doesn't give a shit anymore because it's just been an annoying experience, and part of me thinks, "Wait, should I look it over once more? Revise it?" But I've decided that I'm done, and despite the fact that Jenn probably has a more coherent idea of what she's doing than I do and has more pages on top of that, I'm heading over to the Science Center to print my measly five pages with not-so-MLA margins. Hey, I'm just using normal Word ones. &nbsp; See, I just better stop thinking about this damn paper or something, because I start thinking about it and imagine, "What if I get a C on this? Even worse? What should I do? How do I live with myself?" I know it's not that severe, but I do want to do well. I've just thought about this essay more than I've ever thought about essays, and it's taken me forever to write, not because it requires a lot of information but because I just can't get a thesis down. I probably still don't have a good one, but I'm beyond caring. This is dumb: I'm really rooting for grade inflation right now so I can save some shred of ego. It's not like I can't write, or don't! I just complicated things for myself so that I can't even think straight now. It's no more citing other lit crits or just proving anything--this idea has to be arguable, and completely new and novel at that. Beth sent me an email back this morning with the word "tautological" in it, and it was just about the most depressing thing ever. The word means "a needless repetition of an idea." Lovely, isn't it? &nbsp; It's just so weird thinking ok, I can do this in high school English and then coming here and having no idea what I'm doing. Maybe I'm just overthinking it. But honestly, essays at home were always so much easier. You had a claim you had to support or refute and then you provided your information. There really wasn't an emphasis on originality, or "What kind of insight does this give me?" But see, the thing is, expo here seems like a pretty dumbed down class, like "How do I write an essay?" But is that what I really need to learn this summer? How to write a  real  essay? It's really changed the way I look at things. I just hope I learn to adapt to it, instead of going home and despairing over every other essay I write senior year. &nbsp; I had my interview today. It wasn't the most profound conversation ever with the admissions officer and it was basically, "Tell me about your town and school." I said everything that was true, but I understand now why an interview is such a nominal factor in the admissions process. I just thought I didn't tell her the whole entire story...after all, I could've been a normal kid with a 1200 SAT and blah blah blah...I know test scores aren't everything, but does that boost their opinions of people? So it was all right, but not great. My shoes chafed my feet, so now I'm to wear flip flops until it heals up. &nbsp; I've spent the whole entire day, basically, at the computer, doing the essay. I'm such a loser, and an even bigger one when I receive that terrible grade on this paper. I just don't feel good about it. I'd really like to be surprised and get it back with a B or something, but who knows if they'll be that kind? If grade inflation is a fixture in summer school as well? It's really desperation now, I think. If every day of college at Harvard is going to be like this, I'd rather go to USC or somewhere less competitive. &nbsp; Maybe I just need to go and read anthro until this despair wears off. I'll have the paper printed, and I'll be reading  The Savage and the Innocent , which is probably the best anthro read so far...but damn those Sherente Indians. It's funny how a whole entire society can be changed into greedy, needy, helpless, pathetic people. &nbsp; I guess another consolation is that at least anthro is going ok, but I have the midterm, so who knows what I'll think after  that  trial. &nbsp; Sigh.

      WENDY'S HERE! &nbsp; I'm probably just neurotic, since this is my fourth post today. Tell me I am and spare me the self-diagnosis. &nbsp; I still have "Vindicated" stuck in my head after all these days. Thinking about the paper sends me deeper into despair, though I think I'm done with part one and I just have to think of reasons now of why Swann's obsession was conscious. &nbsp; I think I'm going to stop explaining things now. It trivializes.

      Done with three pages, am now stuck with the question of how is the action Swann's way? &nbsp; Maybe I should stop for today. I'm at least pleased that I got this far, but I still have a ways to go. Maybe I'll start reading  The Savage and the Innocent , another 250 pages of anthro, whoopee! Ahem.  &nbsp; Wendy should be coming in an hour or two. &nbsp; Yay.

      It's early afternoon, and I'm sitting at the computer again. I'm supposed to be typing up the paper. It's not happening, if you haven't noticed already. &nbsp; I  did  finish  Jacob's Room &nbsp;today, though. &nbsp; Argh, I have something for that sports magazine to write about. Should I? Or can I just tell them that I'm at Harvard? &nbsp; I really should get to work. Wendy's coming tonight! We're sleeping over in 16...er, not sleeping over. Just "staying up" so we don't break the sleepover rules. &nbsp; And someone else might later on, too. I guess it's one of those little secrets that you keep to yourself to cheer you up whenever. I didn't even think it was possible, but it would be so nice if it happened. I just don't know what to say. It's just amazing...would&nbsp;they actually do it? I can imagine taking the T to the airport and meeting them and just having an awesome weekend. &nbsp; Enough now. Work time.

      It's pretty late now. Ryan signed off ten minutes before I got back, so I guess I miscalculated: as we walked out of Au Bon Pain I thought he still might be in the movie.  &nbsp; I'm exchanging emails with Mrs. Novak in addition to writing to Mrs. B. Her cuteness even shines through in her emails and I'm just so happy to know these people back home. It'll make for some excellent discussion when I get back, for I'm excited to know what other people think about these books. Certainly, the ones we're reading are lesser-known works of the authors, but it's still an interesting outlook, and if I'm baited, I'll be sure to read the other books. &nbsp; Am on the second page of the lit paper, though I just don't know how it's going to turn out. I'm almost afraid to email it to Beth now for fear that this, too, won't work. I just have to get something going, though what's scaring me is the fact that I haven't gotten a grip, so to speak, quite yet. I needed a break, so I went to ABP with Jenn. I read  Jacob's Room , Jenn mapped out her lit paper. It was certainly a nice change of pace, and it's always more appealing to read at ABP instead of in the room. It's something about the foreign elevator music and random stranger encounters and the funny chairs that really gets me reading. Back in the dorm I just get carried away with Death Cab and obsessively checking email and going online. &nbsp; Tomorrow just means more lit papering and reading. And Wendy! Shopping on Sunday, interview on Monday...

      I don't know just one word to describe this feeling, so I guess I'll have to use more than one: &nbsp; I'm sitting here, and Death Cab's on. I've just returned from a meeting with Beth, the lit TA, and I'm really lost on this thesis for the lit paper. Michael, the confident, opinionated to-be med student was right before me and it was obvious that he had a much better idea of what he was doing: he had a thesis and outline and everything, while I had nothing. I sat down, and placed&nbsp; a blue pen and Proust on the table. Miserable. &nbsp; I just  need &nbsp; to think of something powerfully insightful. It's not going to be any good anymore presenting piddling little statements, repeating the opinions of other people. I'm not angry. In fact, as I was getting up from my chair in Starbucks I just wanted to cry, it was that pathetic. But I didn't. I don't think the occasion  really &nbsp;warranted that kind of desperation.  &nbsp; Now that I'm three weeks in, I have to take seriously that there  are &nbsp;some amazing people here, and they're going to trample me down if I don't manage to buoy myself up. There's always going to be someone more intelligent, more opinionated, more successful than I am, and now the question is, how do I deal with it? Counterattack. &nbsp; I'm just not happy right now. I need to find some way to assert that I'm  doing  something, and doing it well enough to rank among this foreign group of peers.

      I have to blog. Again. &nbsp; So we didn't make it to the next round of trivia bowl...which doesn't bother me. Yes it does. It was the fact that we missed by two questions, and that we could've salvaged two points, possibly, from dumb answers. Rachel Carson did  not  write "The Rite of Spring." Damnit. It was just so close...we were leading at one point and I looked to our proctor Nora and wanted her to call time.  &nbsp; But maybe the thing that bothers me most is the fact that on the winning team, there was this Asian girl. Chinese, I assume. Not only did she know quite a few answers (though not all), she had a Louis Vuitton purse, and a Kate Spade necklace and bracelet. She seemed to be having a good time. Of course she had a good time. She knew that Othello's wife was named Donatella. Winning question. I probably gazed upon that name once...I read summaries of Shakespeare in sixth grade, but my memory has failed me. (It might also help to include that her teammate is this Saudi kid who goes to Andover...he's in the Design seminars too. Rich kids.) &nbsp; She's Chinese, most likely a rising senior, and has it all, on a very basic level: intelligence, material goods and seems bathe in social comfort. &nbsp; Maybe the material part irks me the most, since I haughtily deem myself at least satisfactory in the other two categories. &nbsp; Would Mom let me walk around like that? Spend that kind of money? Would  I &nbsp;let myself spend that kind of money? &nbsp; I've always felt guilty browsing through websites of clothing retailers. It just seems too petty and shallow of me. So I do it, but I always close the page by the time someone gets around. By extension, I don't like to part with much money on one particular thing, though it leads to spending a little on a lot of things. Somehow that is more acceptable to my conscience. &nbsp; Now that I write this all down, it seems even pettier. I shouldn't really care. Besides, I'm going shopping with Wendy Sunday. And what could be better than that? A friend in town, and a need to satisfy. &nbsp; Yeah, I'm happy with the way I am. Really.

      Oh wow, there's a new window on blogger.&nbsp;  And I can even do italics now, whenever the hell I want .  &nbsp;  It's amazing how much one word will do to you, like an "okay." That's disturbing, I'm typing in his IM font right now. It just really makes me wonder what all that crazy stuff was that came out typed last night...how sincere was that? I have a terrible tendency of saying things that border on exactly the opposite of what I really mean.  &nbsp;  And putting aside what I said, how am I supposed to interpret something like an email reply that's only one word in body? If you know anything about me, you know my tendency to overanalyze. One word is enough to set me off for ages.  &nbsp;  What the hell is it that I want? The last thing I want for this journal is for it to turn into the annals of my obsessive existence, volume 2. I'm done with that! And it's an issue of personal strength...after that one blech episode it was time to move on and to assert my independence and realize that yes, there are other meaningful people out there. It's just something that I've never been able to handle. It's almost like I could say that he's the one person I'd trust the most outside of family...or at least I did a while ago when I told him just about everything about my life. I wonder if he's been equally honest with me--wouldn't that be disappointing if he didn't? It's just taken a long time for me to be able to let go of so much, but at the same time, sometimes, I just feel so silly discharging such minor details, etc. Honestly, what does he get when I call him up when I'm just really angry or something and spend an hour crying to him on the phone, especially when he doesn't know what in the world is going on?  &nbsp;  It's really sad to say now, since I thought I was completely over it, but it's just this little funny tug, almost like self-pity but not. Why would I be pitying myself?  &nbsp;  Perhaps he's just an emotionless slab of stone or I've just been expecting too much. In  Swann's Way , I can't help but compare Swann and Odette to whatever I feel sometimes, but it's just so awfully pathetic! I'm not going to admit to a class full of 30 people, probably all more experienced than I, and tell them that I, too, have been obsessed, or jealous, at one time. I just like to wallow in self-pity sometimes. Maybe it  is &nbsp;a matter of self-pity. It's just--why do I feel like I've always wanted this, and I have to read his hieroglyphics to figure out what he wants? It's becoming clearer, yes...the card, and the fact that he actually shredded the journal, but looking back, I realize it was the most beautiful book. But sometimes he'll send you an email that'll just leave you crying because it's  exactly what you wanted to hear  and&nbsp;you'll never&nbsp;see it manifest in real life. We can talk through email, online, on the phone...but in person, it's nothing.  &nbsp;  Or maybe it's that he doesn't want the things that I want. Independence, for one--could you ever really date a guy who didn't drive? I thought, maybe in the big city you could with the public transportation, but in the suburbs?  &nbsp;  I just want to be surprised...to turn around at every corner and find some happy secret waiting for me. Writing letters all last summer was some form of release for me, but was it reasonable to expect something back? or be disappointed when he didn't send anything? Or when it was just awkward pauses? Is it just too outrageous to ask for an unexpected phone call, or a message, or just something little...a clear sign? Or to hear, "Let's go out sometime"?  &nbsp;  How is it that among the few guys who I honestly like in a romantic fashion, nobody knows how to date? Maybe that's the crux of it, and I'm too afraid to admit it out loud.  &nbsp;  I got his card in the mail today. When life gives you lemons, say "*#@!!@# those lemons!" I want to ask him where this card was found. In the "encouragement" section? For what, then?  &nbsp;  What can I expect?

      It's five minutes to 9 (Ellis, I was up at 8:30!) and I'm just about to go downstairs to meet the rest of the breakfast crew, but I just have this weird feeling about me. It has something to do with the legs fatiguing because of last night, and then the expectation of being surprised somehow. And I'm not, so what do I do now?  I don't know what I look like this morning since Ishita's in the shower and consequently using the bathroom. I showered myself at 8:30 and realized that even though I didn't want to be up at that hour, it felt good. I still have "Vindicated" stuck in my head, and I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.   I smell obsession, but how do you stop yourself in this kind of situation?  Today's going to be a busy day. I have to finish anthro reading (just a bit, though), do my laundry, perhaps, go to five hours of class, think up a thesis for that lit paper (something tells me it has to be extraordinary if I'm to do anything right), play trivia bowl, maybe go running...  I just have this feeling now, after listing all the chores, that the only reason why all these things are bearable are because of the people around me...

      Because we were hyper, Jenn and I went running in the Old Yard. She in flip flops, me in Shoan Yin's running shoes. Oh man, it felt good to go running again.  There was this guy from CT sitting still on John Harvard's lap. Apparently his car had broken down and he was stranded, so he just decided to perch there. Jenn thinks he's bitter about not getting into Harvard. While we were talking to the statue guy, a couple (the husband was hispanic, I think, and very tall, and the wife was a petite Indian woman) asked where the music building was, and we took them there, and then back out onto the Square.  The Yard is just so much prettier by night sometimes.   Then we crashed in Charlie's room.  There's just this kind of random bliss that comes with doing something completely unexpected. The only thing barring me from complete satisfaction, though, is the fact that we forgot Adam. He IMed me, knocked on the door...and didn't find out that we were gone until we'd come back. We'll take him tomorrow night.  After the Trivia Bowl, of course. Oh, I hope we do well.

      For the longest time today, I just sat in Annenberg eating my dinner without saying a word. I had Hoobastank stuck in my head. And I was studying the people. As much as I hate to admit it, Nigel's theory that the ugly and pretty stick to themselves in their own respective groups is holding pretty true. I don't think I can ever feel as secure as I do when I'm home because I don't know a good amount of people, and unconsciously too much time is devoted to estimating what other people think of me, or how they judge me depending on what I'm wearing or what I'm doing, etc. (ew, she has a Cal sweatshirt on...).  I think part of the insecurity is from belonging, if I may, to a temporary coterie. As the people around you settle down and grow complacent and become weirder and weirder (read: Matt) you sometimes wonder if you're in the right situation. Or if you can branch out and find some other people. It's not dissatisfaction, no, or maybe it's simply denial, and I'm comfortable the way I am, but it's always that road not taken complex.  The more I see of people, the more I form some model of an ideal person. Sometimes you see a person and try to gauge in a shallow way whether or not they fit those specifications, though deep down one can never really know.  Lydia's perception of an ideal person?  More than anything, the person has to be reasonably intelligent and put it to good use. The smarter the better, though there's a catch: no dorks. They have to be involved and do well in those areas. They have to be reasonably attractive, or at least ok to look at--I'm not being superficial, but if you were applying for a job interview and A and B were the same in stats except B was ugly, you tell me who's going to be picked for the job. They have to be approachable, a leader, one always with a smile. They have to want something, and something reasonable, and have a plan for it. They have to know how to communicate--I guess that goes along with leadership. They just have to sparkle and at least have some respectable friends. You must think I'm crazy now, but you know what I'm talking about--there are just some people that move in a crowd. Someone you can completely respect and actually like.  Maybe it's better not put in words. It's just gut feeling. I don't know how rational it is to try to be that kind of person...but the impression I get is that there are quite a few of these types here at Harvard, even more so during the regular year.  But you know, perhaps idolatry is simply sheer madness.  There's too many people walking around with Harvard paraphernalia on, so much so that I'm almost embarrassed to wear my own Harvard sweatshirt out. So I'm sticking with Cal. Go bears. I wonder how much truth was held in Grandma's statement when she said, "What? You want to go to Harvard for a summer just to go there once?" as if she was hinting that I wasn't going to get in for the regular year. I'm usually not so picky about college gear since I'm guilty of possessing it myself, but for some reason I'm sensitive to this Harvard thing.  I'm just retarded. Why do I try to fit everyone to my ideals? What good does that do me, the world? Don't listen to me, really.  I did better on my response paper than I thought I would.  Opinions should be handled carefully. On one extreme is Matt, who posts up "Screw Kerry, Go Bush!" signs on the Pennypacker doors even though I haven't heard him argue any political policy and I only know he's a die-hard conservative, but that doesn't do much for my respect for him. It's sad to know that he's going to vote in the next presidential election. I hope there isn't a whole brigade of hicks out there like that who blindly vote on political issues without educating themselves. I really hate him. There's the Asian fetish thing, saying just about the stupidest things ever to escape from a human mouth, flinging food across the table, the pickup lines...just being a general asshole. And he keeps on apologizing and then committing the same offenses again.   And then you'll have some conversations in a lifetime (many, actually) when nobody cares what you're going to do. "When do you guys want to go?" "Doesn't matter." I guess that's when it's appropriate to take a stand, but then you're afraid of turning Nazi.  They tore the newspaper off the walls of 16. Boo hoo.  I better start reading the course pack.

      My eyes are starting to get dry now. Wow, I didn't realize it was already this late over here, but I guess it must be. Pretty soon I'll step into the bathroom and take out those contacts...  Am I allowed to say that I'm pleased? It's like last summer all over again, except in reverse. I listened to him practice today, he just put his cell phone on the stand and you could hear him breathe in for one last breath before he started playing, etc. We both sent out letters today. I wonder what this card is supposed to say, for from what he tells me it's supposed to be witty or have some other sort of kick in it. And I ask myself, what is this?! Is it even right, after all the stupid little things that happened in between? How is it even possible that this is so much more the situation I would have preferred a long time ago, and it's happening now, after everything's done? But I can't complain. It just has to make you wonder, what's a friend? For I can honestly say that he's the one person outside of my family (or even including my family, sometimes) that knows the most about me. Granted, not all those parts are pleasant, and sometimes that holds me back a bit. He'll say random details that I swear I didn't tell him but apparently I did. It's just some sort of weird connection, a pattern we accidentally fall into. He actually shredded the journal. I can't believe it.  Put in alumni names at the Crimson today. I met one girl from Beverly High (I think her name's Brittany?) in the Mail Center (where I received a lovely postcard from Peter) and we walked to 14 Plympton together. It's just menial work, yes, but it's the Crimson! I kind of spoke to the president, Erica, for a minute or two. I must have seemed like another passive, timid Asian who wanted to go to Harvard, etc. but the more I go into the Crimson offices the more I realize that I honestly love journalism and the environment and the cameraderie and everything that comes along with it. I'll try to go help out some other time, but I have papers due.  On page 519 of Proust. Out of 606. I want to finish as soon as possible so I can take care of this anthropology paper.  I guess you could say it often takes unexpected circumstances to make you happy. But how long does it last? And how real is this?   "Yours is a farce, which I merely laugh at." I like that line. I forget where it's from, though.  Anyways, good night. Back to Proust!

      Another Swann quote before I just bowl over in that "damnit, I've been there!" feeling...  Other people as a rule mean so little to us that, when we have invested one of them with the power to cause us so much suffering or happiness, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of one's life a sort of stirring arena in which he or she will be more or less close to one.  But Odette isn't into Swann now. How sad.  I honestly enjoy this book, though that enjoyment has increased enormously only because I've gotten to part 2. It's much better than Political Systems...I tried going back to it after much Swann and didn't like it. I was lost in the tribal lineages, etc.  I need to shower, but it's too late and I'm obviously too lazy.  No music for now. It'll disturb the peace.  I met Victoria for coffee today at the Starbucks in the Garage. She's still the same as I remembered. I think there's a distinct style about her. For some reason, I always get the sense that I was just the little cruddy freshman and sophomore who idolized her for being editor and for going to Harvard and that she has every right to stand me up. But she's been nicer than I thought I deserved. She's called me twice already to meet up somewhere and offered to take me to parties...There's just something missing, though. With Sylvia at Wendy's we can just talk for two hours over lunch and keep laughing, etc. but I guess it's just because Vicky and I don't really share much in common anymore. She has a boyfriend. She's turning 18 next year...oh, September 2. Not next year. The thing that makes me think the most is her telling me that her first year at Harvard was difficult academically. It's not important to estimate how difficult that is...that's just irrelevant and intrusive. It just makes me think that ok, if I get into Harvard it's not going to be all fun and games.  And I apply it to life even now. Am I going to get my courses under control here? I really want to get A's in both classes, and the biggest mystery is lit. I'm keeping up with the reading and everything, but our first paper is due July 20 and I haven't a topic. I have some sort of inferiority complex and don't think I have anything profound to share.  I guess getting A's isn't really the point, but I don't want to come away struggling either. How bad could it be? It's just so confusing, since it's true: I idolized her, and to know that Harvard's not a walk in the park for her? I have to ask myself, what am I good at? Not math or science. English? But only if I'm comfortable and learn to speak up.  Well, I have more thinking to do.  Even though we can't talk much, Victoria's still very nice about things. She told me that if I got in, I could stay with her during pre-frosh weekend...  If I get in.  It's probably not healthy that I'm on a power trip right now. One of these days I'm going to experience something humbling and I'll be moody and quiet and reflective for a while.  Matt didn't confront an Asian girl today--he chickened out, even with all the pretty ones in Annenberg. Ahem.  And I just finished watching Requiem for a second time. It really just sets in on you. I feel almost dead, or asleep.  I'm getting the camera cord and the credit card sent to me. Yay.  For some reason I thought of a reason to panic just now. And I forget why I'm panicking. What could possibly be wrong right now? I'm thinking.  Oh, the Crimson. I don't know if I should go in and help out. For brownie points. Vicky knows Mike Conti, who's the design chair. Apparently he's good at getting drunk.  I might go.  Anyways, too much rambling.

      For some reason, knowing that Odette is in love with Swann and not vice versa ticks me off. I'd like to say I've been there, but have I?  "Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. 'If only,' she wrote, 'you had also forgotten your heart! I should have never let you have that back.'"  The only other time when I felt such an acute sense of empathy was in Tender, when Nicole pines after Richard.  There's so many couples walking around Cambridge...  And I'd like to think I'm stronger than that? Well, it shouldn't be important now.

      Saturday evening, and I guess I'm going to spend it in the normal way: staying put and reading. Sarah and Ishita and co. just stepped out of the room ready to go clubbing or whatever. I prefer a slower, quieter kind of life, I guess. Straight out of a J. Crew catalog, or so I'd like to think. I have an itch to go shopping, but I think I'll wait for Wendy.  Waiting for Jenn to finish her dinner so we can go to Au Bon Pain to get more Proust reading done.  There's a really cheap Mexican place below the Garage...Felipe's. Not as good as anything back home, but an acceptable substitute.  So now that they're gone, I can just turn up Jimmy Eat World.  I'm on p. 229 of Proust. Out of a possible 606.  Going to lunch with Victoria tomorrow.  Today's just disappeared fast. I don't have much Burma reading left, and then there's always Proust.   Brittara's in town. I don't know if they got back, but we left her and Charlie in the Garage and we just walked back to the dorms, etc.  It's been a nice day. Yup yup.

      Someone in the apartment across the way is listening to Stairway to Heaven. I've probably heard it three times already in the past two days, and something enchants me about it: here I am, I don't know a single Led Zeppelin song except for that one and it plays over and over again. I'm tempted to listen to it too on my computer.  Oh, the CTY memories...

      Blogger burnout? That sounds quite relevant for now.  I'm not going to write about my day since I already emailed Mrs. B and then the home-folks.  Well, maybe I will.  I WENT TO YALE, OK? Really, I'm not that cranky. I am still of the persuasion that it's not better than Harvard, except the only thing that might tip the scales (slightly, mind you) is the fact that their residential colleges are awesome. To be trite: imagine Harry Potter. And put that in New Haven. It's just so nice: old stone buildings, courtyards with flowers, benches. The admissions officer who talked to us, Jim Nondorf, was amazing. You meet so few of those charismatic, successful people in your life that you just have to sit in awe. Funny thing: right when we got off the bus, they asked us if any of us wanted to get a Yale interview right then and there since they had six slots open, and Jenn and I wanted to...Jenn's ID card was drawn, so she got one. It's just scary to think that the college application process is so close at hand.  What almost annoys me, though, is the fact that so many people think they're worthy of Yale. Or any Ivy league, for that matter. I mean, the Yale average SAT score for the last class was 1500, which is absolutely amazing, but how many of these people can fulfill those requirements? Or come close, at least? In this case, Jenn puts it perfectly: it's like you've been working hard all this time and when other people who have put in less effort think they're going to reap the same benefits, it just angers you, because that's not why you worked so hard. I think Harvard SSP has mislead many people in thinking that they're of Harvard caliber, and they're obviously not. It's reassuring? nice? scary? to think that only a small percentage of the people here will actually get into Harvard, but that's the way it's really supposed to be. And I guess if it's hrad, it's not like I can really complain. I work, we all work...if we don't make it over that bar, we can only blame ourselves (or maybe the idiosyncrasies of the college admissions system...). It's just weird hearing people with 3.5 GPA's and average personality (and whatever can be derived from outward judgment like that) saying they're going to apply to all the Ivies. What, to get...rejected?  I'm not being nice. I'm sure one day someone in the high heavens will wield their thunderbolt and strike me down for being so irreverent and such a bitchy, pompous ass.  Well, I got my AP scores today...I can sleep at night again.  See, the weird thing is, I feel like I've been very, very lucky so far. I don't have much to complain about: I have a wonderful family and a great network of friends. Material needs, within reason, have been satisfied. I do things that make me happy. I get good results. It's just...you have to think, when does all this fairy tale end? Will everything just crumble when I get rejection letter upon rejection letter come December and April? Is it really luck? Or have I been working hard and not noticing it?  Most of the time, I can't disturb this aura of felicity and I'll just let it be, but now I wonder, how far is this going to get me? Is this a good enough edge for all those Ivy wannabes? Have I just been a snot all this time and I'm just going to get a handy lesson next spring?  I should be humbler too. I really want to be that classic Harvard student walking down the street with a book bag and a respectable look about her face. Call me weird, but that's as far as my dreaming goes nowadays. It's not future riches or relationships or anything like that, it's GETTING INTO MY TOP-CHOICE COLLEGE.  How demented is that? Especially when I promised myself I wouldn't think about college this summer?  Success is just the greatest feeling in the world. Tempering it is just as important as the attainment of success.  I have a lot of reading this weekend. Argh.

      Here I am, reading about Grusha and kneeling women and this really bizarre case study about infantile neurosis and fear of butterflies, etc. when I remember:  It's gone. It went out with last week's recycling.  I don't know why I was suddenly panicked. Maybe that's not the word. I just remembered it for some strange reason (obviously, the reading doesn't remind me in the least bit of a picture lying at the bottom of the recycling  bin).  There's no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that it's gone it's like it wasn't there at all and here I rest  where disappointment and regret collide lying awake at night, up all night when I'm lying awake at night  Perhaps it plays into that girl/masochistic complex, but whenever I reflect upon it, I tend to think that I'm the one who was cheated out of so many things. I can bring up so many examples. But then I remember I wasn't the fairest party in the situation either, so I must've committed my share of wrongs.  I don't understand why it's still so important to me, though it's not so in its original sense. I just can't get rid of it somehow. It's not like I hate him outright, but I don't particularly embrace him either. Makes good conversation, but will sign off abruptly. As he should, I'm not the nicest person to talk to, frankly. It's one of the biggest things that've changed me, though if I think about it, it wasn't such a big deal at all. It's a place to draw so many anecdotes.  I really have to go read now, and you probably didn't want to read this strange reflective babbling...

      I'm really tired.  Jenn and I went on an outing to Copley today to return the skirt and look around. She went crazy in Bath and Body Works :) and bought lotion, while I simply marveled at the color spectrum. Maybe I just never developed an attraction to antibacterial anything.  We got back just when the cafeteria was about to close...luckily, we hurried in and got our waffles and food. It was just so weird just sitting there and not talking because we were so busy eating. Remember last night? I thought it'd be ok, since I woke up this morning more comfortable in bed than I'd ever been, and by 2pm I was hungry all over again. I'm still tired from walking around. I think I'll have to go to Widener to get something for the research paper before it closes at 5, lovely.  I need to finish writing for anthro today. Hm.

        Okay. It's time to be homesick.      I'm so tired of walking into the bathroom in here and finding a puddle of water right in front of the toilet. In recent history, I can't really remember a time in the past few days when I could just use the bathroom without rolling up my pants. I really think it's Shoan Yin's fault...I remember one day I knew the floor was perfectly dry. I took a shower. Toweled off. The floor was still relatively dry. Sarah's complained about it before, so it can't be her. I don't think it's Ishita. Or whoever's doing it, stop it, really. It's disgusting, and it's not going to go away...  And then last night and just now I found blood on the toilet seat. I mean, come on. It's definitely not me. When one flushes the toilet, one should notice if one left blood there. I wiped it off once. There's more today. I mean, what the hell! It's not that hard...and there shouldn't be blood there anyway.  Ok, so maybe I'm guilty of shedding hair (I try not to...) and leaving kleenex all over my desk, but I try not to dirty public areas. Should I confront the roomies about it? It's just not pleasant.  Arr.

      My desk is a horrid mess. I've even enclosed a picture below. I think between old cups and bottles and kleenex and books open and papers askew, it's the worst it's ever been since I got here. I'm going to have to clean up before I get any more work done or else I myself will go insane.  But it's almost lunchtime, we'll see.

      I just woke up. This is bad. If I were in school right now, I'd be in the middle of fifth period, or journalism. Wow, I guess I was really that tired last night.  I kept on having weird dreams. Let's just say that I hope that nothing in my dreams last night ever happens in real life.  I'm still kind of dazed. It's that time in the morning when you know everyone back home is going to sleep until 11:30 too, so you can't expect them online.  Today's my meeting with Beth. Jenn and I both agree that it scares us, walking in to talk to her about our theses...I don't understand that feeling of dread, but it happens. As soon as I brush my teeth, etc. and get some normal clothes on it's going to be work out a thesis time. Well, I guess I already have one, kind of, but I don't know if it's good enough.  Isn't that what life is like? "I don't know what's good enough."  It's cloudy today.  I figured out yesterday at ABP that I could count the days left directly by knowing what day of the month it was. It didn't occur to me that at three weeks left, August started. So today's the sixth. I have about 15 days until SSP is over. Wow. And then a few more days on top of that until I actually am in sunny, wonderful California again.  It's not that I'm homesick, really. It'll just be nice being done with all the papers and work and all. And I'll still see Charlie and Jenn around, so no sweat...  Yeah, I should go. Bye, you guys.

      Harvard never ceases to surprise me.  Yesterday, Jenn, Aaron and I walked into the new Yard hearing strange brass noises. As we approached, we discovered that there was a senior picnic in full swing there--with real, octagenarian seniors, all in various stages of aging and mobility. They were dancing on the steps of Memorial. An ambulance (just in case!) was parked in front of Thayer.  I walked back from breakfast this morning to see a black truck parked near the steps of Memorial. It was labeled DEATHWISH, with creepy gold trim. I looked around to the side, and apparently DEATHWISH is the name of a piano moving company. I was slightly offended..."My piano was moved by deathwish!"  On a side note, I find it amusing that piano moving is actually a business. But when you think about it, it's so complex that it has to be. I try to remember, did they install our piano in pieces? Did they separate the legs? I don't remember, then.  Futher into the yard, I met a Japanese man in a half pirate/half Catholic schoolgirl costume. He had the boots and a little black pack with a gold emblem on it and an obvious pirate hat, but he was wearing a plaid skirt and a white blouse. Trailing behind him was an entourage of what appeared to be Japanese tourists. I thought, ok, people dressed up in Revolutionary-era clothing lead tours on the Freedom Trail, but a pirate/schoolgirl in the middle of Harvard Yard!  I'm really looking forward to journalism senior year.  I still have a headache and that crazy dizziness thing. I don't know what's wrong with me...might it be dehydration? Mom suggested that. I'm consuming a reasonable amount of food (in fact, more than reasonable!) and sugar at that. I'm not even taking the Tylenol Cold anymore. I think of all the creepy things I could have. Meningitis. West Nile (it's in Southern California!). I should stop being a hypochondriac and get on with life.  I got hit yesterday with a large amount of anthro work. I just finished the professor's book on the Runa. The fact that it has six "used" stickers and obvious liquid stains is cause for concern. I wonder if they'll take my copy back for a seventh go. The Ecuadorian Indians are even worse at "alphabet soup" than the New Deal. I still have an article to go in the coursepack, and then on to Calvino!  I'm still listening to the Strokes. I'll stop. Maybe. My roommates must think I'm neurotic since I listen to the same CD's over and over. At the beginning of SSP, it was Transatlanticism. Now it's the Strokes. Is This It? was on for a good part of yesterday, since I was stuck at the computer writing the paper...  Austin's getting home tomorrow from CTY. I wonder if Mom and Dad and Grandma miss not having kids around, but at least they don't have to feed us and take us everywhere and deal with cries of "Mom, I'm going out!" I'm sure this opinion's going to change, so I'll think about it now: Mom and Dad and Grandma are each special to me in their own special way. At least I get along with them most of the time now, though I can think of instances in the past when I was figuratively at war with all three of them. It's particularly nice to be so close to Grandma. I probably don't talk to her, etc. during the school year as much as I should.  A thought just popped up in my head: will Mom want to use my car more and more now that she's undertaking her after-school project? I don't want to compete with her. Grandma still likes to retain control of hers. I understand why Mom doesn't want to drive her good car, but I still have places to go too. Hm.  I'm actually wearing shoes today instead of flip flops. Yay for funny tan lines.  Time for more reading.

      I just got off the phone with Mommy.  And for some reason, my headache's gone now.  It still makes me smile: Mom, Mr. Jeng and Tren's mom are going to start an after-school program for 3rd-5th graders for 25-30 kids. Mom's going to teach computers--so she's putting that computer science degree to use! Maybe I'm still in shock, but to me, that seems so awesome. I can't complain anymore that Mom's not  doing anything  with her education. Of course, this isn't hardcore work--it's only 3-6pm when school's in session--but still, it's a project. I'd be so willing to help out if they needed me. I don't mind donating some of my old stuff. I wonder if Mom still knows how to deal with little kids, since Austin and I are a little past that age group now. Wow, it's just so great. It's almost like formal recognition that Austin and I are growing up and that we can handle things ourselves. For one, I can drive myself to school and lessons and stuff, and drive Austin too, if need be. I wonder if Austin's as excited as I am.  And then we talked school. It's nice, I think the parents have finally realized that I'm almost done with this darned testing/puffing yourself up for college process. It makes me doubly happy to know that they're happy with the way I've turned out too. Emily's dad volunteered to coach me for the USC baccalaureate/med program interviews, haha. I love Mr. Cheung. I think there's at least a hundred TOCS kids out there who'd agree.  Wow, this is great. Life is good.

      For some reason, there's something wrong with my head today. I'm feeling dizzy--I was just typing the response paper and I could have sworn I was levitating above the keyboard or something. Before that, I had a headache, maybe from funny smells. That happens a lot. I just don't know what to do with it, since it usually doesn't happen. I took Tylenol, but the only kind I had was the cold kind, so in addition to alleviating my throbbing in the back of my head, it's also supposed to stop coughing and something else. I don't bother to remember anymore.  Arr, this sucks. It's really something I can't control. I even tried napping, particularly unpleasant since I have a response paper and another load of anthro reading to do. That helped, maybe. I don't know what's wrong with me.  We have seventeen days left here. Wow.  Change of plans: I'm leaving SSP on Saturday, August 21 and getting home on the 24th. I think I already told you. Blame it on the headache/dizziness/whatever's going on up there.  I had to vent. It's back to the response paper.

      Mildly annoyed because it ends up that I'm going to miss orientation back home. I have a terrible orientation record. Counting senior year, I will have missed 75% of them.  I just got back from a design interns meeting. The last.  Which made me forget about the paper. Hah. B/B+. I honestly can't complain, since the grade is better than I expected. It's one of those rare, uncomfortable moments when you don't dare flip the comments sheet over and read it. But I did. Nothing I didn't already know, really.  I'm glad I'm here before I have to go into college, so I know what kind of ego-trampling just one difficult class does to me. It hasn't been traumatic or anything, but it's one of those things that irritate you and eventually force you to realize that you're probably not all that great in the real world. I honestly don't expect an A in lit since there are obviously more intelligent people in there who actually deserve good marks. I'd be troubled if I got an A, honestly. I mean, I've done the reading religiously, but there's just something about the paper and the level of interpretation that I have yet to grasp. It's completely different from anthro, where the papers there are mere book reports or compilations of research on a certain topic. Nothing too deviant from the familiar ways of high school work.  It's just weird. I'm not too bothered by that grade at all. Though I think if I continue this attitude into college I'll be running into problems.  Today's been a full day, at least. I was ten minutes late for breakfast, but I finally did practice piano. I learned how to sign in/out, find a room, etc. The music department here somehow reminds me of the one at UC Davis, particularly in the sense that I got lost looking for the practice rooms. But it's really more than I can ask for. I found my room (the rooms are oriented in clusters, like UC Davis's) and there was nobody in the adjacent rooms so I didn't have to gape at someone else's better playing when I wasn't making music myself. I literally yelped out loud when I opened the door, turned on the lights and saw a Steinway grand. It's a bit old and well-loved, as public pianos are, but it still sounded all right. The pedal is more sensitive than the one at home, but it'll teach me to pedal discriminately. I wonder how they fit the pianos in there in the first place. I imagine the pianos haven't seen any other environment than the practice room in thirty years. There's also a mirror to the right, so I can see my elegant slouch when I play. That's sarcastic, of course. I went over Schumann today for about an hour and 45 minutes, and didn't even finish. It was nice to get the fingers warmed up again. I thought, I should do this between breakfast and lunch every day from now on, but...  I found out I have a response paper due Thursday, and the lit paper and the anthro research paper due August 12, next Thursday. I have an idea that the rest of my days are going to be spent reading and writing. It's all right, I guess, but there's just the pressure to produce something tangible, instead of just doing the reading and having the prof assume that you read. But I've been keeping up with that, too, so I hope that helps. Andrew's coming August 8. So much for pure fun.  One day Jenn and I will ride the T just back and forth, not getting off until we wind back up at Harvard again. Jenn wants to go to Wonderland, at the end of the blue line. How great does that sound? "Trains to WONDERLAND." Or, "Where are you going?" "Wonderland."  It's weird. "Wonder," "wonderful" and "wonderland" have different nuances about them. I think "wonder" is German. Or it sounds German. Maybe it's from the word  wunderkind , as in Mozart, stored in the back of my head.  Journalism questions: how does one have a staff exclusively for layout? Should we do that? It'd cure consistency problems quite a bit, but it'd be difficult to communicate on articles and proofreading, etc. Wouldn't the layout people have to finish the layout first? I think we should get better center spreads next year too. Or just better stories.   Pale Fire  is amazing.  Ew, that gets me thinking of my old thesis. Should I keep it?  Let's end on a happy note.  Listen to the Strokes.

      I have the chorus to "Take It or Leave It" stuck in my head so I think I'll go back to Death Cab.  I'm back from Widener. So I found the system to look up journals, and found two of them. The third was in the EconP section where they had space-saving bookshelves: they're technically all packed together with just one aisle space between, say, seven rows, and when you want to access a section you have to press a button and all the bookshelves slide. Too bad someone else was in the econ stacks too and I didn't really need it right now so I left. Widener is amazing. Even if you don't have sex in it (according to Harvard lore, one is not a man before he has sex in the library, besides other silly acts) it's one of those places that just leave you in awe because it's just so large. Every time I cross over the Pusey tunnel I feel the weight of three other floors, at least, above me. There's just so many books. I wonder who regulates what's purchased for the library, though some books are so obscure or trivial I like to flip to the back cover to see the last time it was checked out.  I finished  Pale Fire  today. I think the ending made up for all of Kinbote's snobbishness. Wow. But I think people start to get a feel for the ending before it gets there. That's all I'll say, to save the plot for Katy. It's surreal. For some reason it reminds me of Madeleine L'Engle. I guess we're all so obsessed with a particular place or an unparticular place that we forget the imaginary, and so we miss the magic of Zembla and King Charles the Beloved, etc.  Is it weird to be planning out your first day of school?  I'm just sitting here watching my arm twitch. I hope that's not abnormal.

      I'm back from the archives. The lady manning the desk is one of those overly solicitous cases that always elicit some sort of suspicion in me. Or maybe it's just the archive system that brings out this unctuousness in people. Every time you go in, you have to sign your name, your permanent address (to track you down in case you make off with something?) your status, affiliation, and your topic. Before you go, you have to sign a sheet basically affirming that you're not going to plagiarize. Before I actually got out of the archive doors, I was asked when I'd be back. "Uh, I don't know," said I. The lady said that if I didn't show up they'd just send the paper back. "Monday," I offered. The lady made a face. "Ok, Friday." She still didn't seem so happy.  I wonder if Harvard looks up journals too...I remember BIOSIS was comparatively awesome last year at Davis. I'm wearing my Davis shirt today.  Yes, it's time to ponder about the name: Lever 2000. "For all your 2000 parts." First, what constitutes a "part?" If you take something like "torso," can you take it apart, like "bellybutton" and "stomach"? Do they count inner organs? Can't they count structures, then? And if you take a finger, can't you separate it into the finger proper, and then the cuticle, and then the nail? Is a joint a part? We know how many bones there are in the body, but parts?  Yeah, I should go off and do research now.

      It's morning!  I'm sitting here, finally awake: Ishita was in the bathroom from the time I was awake until at least 9:30, when I gave up and left for breakfast. That's one of my pet peeves, taking forever in the shower. I've been critiqued twice for taking "short" showers. Yeah, so I don't take up your bathroom time. It's not that I'm not clean, or that they're particularly so. I just don't understand what takes so long.  There was a girl in here past 1am last night talking about some guy Derek at the top of her voice and laughing. I shut the door to the room in protest. And Sarah talks on the phone all the time. I don't want to seem like I'm listening in, but the first thing she does in the morning is take the phone off the charger.  Maybe it's nice that I'll be going home.  I didn't realize the research paper and the lit essay were due so soon. It's August 2 today, I have to finish both by 1:30pm August 12. Ten days. I think I should get started on anthro, perhaps. I'm going to the archives today. Maybe I'll bring the computer and just type out the whole entire article on it. I wonder if that's allowed, or if I even need all that information.  Today's going to be all right. I have to finish Nabokov and check up on what I'm supposed to read for anthro, plus maybe think of questions for discussion. Andrew's going to be here in less than a week. I just realized that. I wonder what he's bringing with him.  Matt grows more and more repulsive by the day. Too bad Ellis's 22-year-old sister  isn't  BoA. "Is she attractive? easy?" Sprinkle in phrases of bad Spanish and misspelled English. Ignorance is disgusting. When's the last time I was so thoroughly repulsed by someone? I can't quite remember.  It's another case of the Mondays.

      I need to stop posting.  Every time I come back to the room, it's humid as hell, for some reason. Jenn and I were at ABP, reading. I never thought I'd find an uncomfortable position there, but I think I did today. Maybe it's just because I'm feeling weird to start with.  Novak is right: the character of Kinbote in  Pale Fire  is despicable. I can't stand him, he's always so self-righteous and thinks that Shade should've put his Zemblan theme into his last work. Sybil hates him, and that's quite right. There's a reason he didn't get his Zemblan theme, there's a reason the Shades didn't tell him where they were really staying, there's a reason why John didn't want to tell Kinbote about his poem in the first place. The more I read, the more I compare Kinbote to Matt. Both are bullheaded, both think they  have  to be right, both annoy me with their lack of perception, humility and respect for others.  I'm inclined to think that Nabokov intentionally created such a character, that it isn't in the author's intrinsic nature to insert a character so stupid (for want of a better word), to let such an ignorant figure dictate the course of his novel, if we can even call it that. If it's not intentional, then I don't think I can say that I respect Nabokov as a writer.  I remember I wrote up a list of books I wanted to read at the beginning of summer. I think I'll have to revise, for most of the stuff on there is pop and, therefore, trash. I should read up on more classics.  So here's the new one, just to jog my memory: finish Sons and Lovers Middlemarch Portrait of a Lady Ulysses any Toni Morrison Finnegan's Wake any Virginia Woolf The French Lieutenant's Woman any Gish Jen A Doll's House any Albert Camus (The Plague...etc.) finish In Search of Lost Time Beckett's Malone Dies and The Unnamable get Soul Mountain again and actually finish it  I should find my old list at home, cross off all the bad ones and remake one. I used to keep a running list. I wonder where this ratty piece of paper went.  I'm not looking forward to leaving this place, but sometimes I also itch for change, to be able to go home and see old people again. To be back in my kind of normal society. I'm leaving on the 20th, a Friday. We're driving out to Cape Cod and arriving in Princeton at night. We'll see Princeton on Saturday, drive the hour to NYC and spend Sunday there, and see Columbia on Monday. Monday night we're flying back at 6:30, so we'll probably get back to LA at around 8. I just don't know when everyone else is going to leave...I know it's a lemming-like mindset, but I don't want to leave until everyone else does. In retrospect, that's silly logic. I'll see Charlie and Jenn when I get back home, and they're the people I'm closest to here.  Yeah, I'll be ok.  Back to this maddening Nabokov stuff.

      It's cloudy today, and Shoan Yin said there was slight drizzle. Funny that the only one who thinks it's hot is me. Or maybe it's just sleeping where I sleep, with all my hair wrapping around my neck. I've pondered more than once about cutting it off, but it's probably wise to keep it for senior pictures. I dislike being sick. I woke up with a strange, bloody nick on my thumb.  I never realized how good Kudos bars are.  Today's to be a reading day, I suppose.  And I'd better change before I go to lunch.  Happy birthday, Nige.

      Random, scattered thoughts.  Walking back from the square, there was a man reading from the scripture at the top of his voice. "FIRST TIMOTHY..." (flips pages). He just kept on flipping. I wonder if he was really going to read from first Timothy or if he was just crazy. I don't know how to deal with panhandlers. There's always someone outside CVS and yes, I do have pennies I could get rid of, but why should I give it to them? It's not a matter of the worth of the pennies. I just see them puffing away on cigarettes (or something else less innocuous, but who knows) and eating. Maybe I'm just one of those cynics who don't believe in welfare. I'd rather give money to a hobo who really looked like they were trying to improve their situation instead of sitting outside somewhere jiggling a Dunkin Donuts styrofoam cup and entreating you to donate "spare change..." (repeat).  There was also a pretty complete band in the pit tonight. People were dancing around with their arms in the air and the tamer ones were just gathered around. It's kind of sad, since I imagined we'd do little things if Ryan were in town...sit on the steps of the pit when it wasn't too crowded, just visit places. It's really nice outside now for humid weather. Jenn and I walked back from the concert through the yard, and it was just this humidity that enveloped you and made you feel like everything in the world was all right. I also saw the assistant concertmaster on the fringes of the pit crowd, carrying her violin. Maybe I miss orchestra. It's just something about belonging.  For some reason, I've been thinking about churches lately. Maybe it's because we stepped inside three today on the Freedom Trail...I'm really fascinated by the pews in the Catholic church. I wish I could sit like that. That'd almost be worth sitting through a service. Maybe the thing that bothers me about going is the collection. I wonder why I'm so reluctant to fork over a $5 when I can justify spending so much more on other things. Maybe it's because I don't believe in it. Maybe it's because I thought tonight's orchestra concert was worth five dollars and an hour at church isn't. I understand giving to the church, but I don't understand why I should, when I'm not even sure what my beliefs are.  Are people in college towns always in couples? I see them all over the place. I think so...the place is full of twentysomethings. That makes sense. Maybe that's another slight reason I want to get out of here. So I don't have to see couples.  I'm just really bored today. Tonight. I got another bottle of water, Triscuits and snack bars since I'm randomly hungry (I stole Adam's pot roast, but in my defense, Charlie only told me it was Adam's  after  I'd microwaved it) and I probably need to drink more water to stave off this cold. I keep on checking the buddy list, and it's the same people online. It's not discontent, but I wonder where this sudden bad humor came from.  Am I just crazy when I think that some people just shine with authority, talent, and all around good-person-ness?
