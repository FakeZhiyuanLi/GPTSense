       Another  urlLink criticism , this time from the  urlLink Center for American Progress .  More proof that Bush's supreme arrogance prevents him from admitting any error or following any advice by experts.  Did you know that the Army War College predicted exactly what has happened before we ever set foot in Iraq?  Yet Bush completely ignored their advice and their prediction has come true to the letter.   "The risk of the United States winning the war and losing the peace is real and serious. Rehabilitating Iraq will consequently be an important challenge that threatens to be a long and painful process, but merely 'toughing it out' is not a solution. The longer the occupation continues, the greater the potential that it will disrupt society rather than rehabilitate it…Thinking about the war now and the occupation later is not an acceptable solution."

       The Center for American Progress noted the irony in Bush's appearance at the War College which has released a string of reports condemning the president's handling of Iraq and the war on terror. In January, one War College Professor released a report that concluded " "the invasion of Iraq was a diversion from the more narrow focus on defeating al Qaeda." Another report came out in March warning that in Iraq the US was "ignoring the more critical strategic aim of creating a stable, democratic nation." And last month a third report warned that U.S.-Arab relations would suffer if the US fails to articulate a clear exit strategy in Iraq.  --from Democracynow.org

       The [President's] speech [on the course of Iraq] comes just a day after four-star General Anthony Zinni, who was once in charge of all American troops in the Middle East, appeared on 60 Minutes and scathingly criticized the administration's handling of Iraq. Zinni, the former commander-in-chief of the United States Central Command said, "At this stage, it should be evident to everybody that they've screwed up." He later added, "To think that we are going to 'stay the course,' --- the course is headed over Niagara Falls. I think it's time to change course a little bit, or at least hold somebody responsible for putting you on this course. Because it's been a failure."  From  Democracy Now!

       The Associated Press has released a videotape that appears to back up Iraqi claims that the US bombed a wedding party last week killing about 40. The US has admitted to waging the attack but denied a wedding party was hit. However the video appears to show before-and-after footage from the wedding and some victims and survivors of the attack appear to be in the wedding video.

       A fascinating  urlLink article  on how big money has influenced the Iraq war and politics in Washington under the Bush administration.  The rich get richer.  The poor either get poorer or killed in a rich man's war.   "[T]he men behind the Carlyle Group drift through Washington like familiar ghosts, profiteering off the carnage of Bush's disastrous crusades, untroubled by any thought of congressional investigation or criminal prosecution, firm in the knowledge that the worse things get for the people of the world, the less secure and more gripped by fear the citizens their own country become, the more millions they will reap for themselves. Perpetual war means perpetual profits."   Also, check out the excellent on-line magazine that published this piece:  urlLink www.counterpunch.org .

       As of today, according to  urlLink iraqbodycount.net , American intervention in Iraq has killed between 9,148 and 11,005  civilians  in Iraq.  Between 3 and 4 times more than the number of innocent people killed in the World Trade Center.  I only wish I had the figures on how many innocent civilians have been killed in Afghanistan.  Haven't we taken enough revenge yet?  When is it enough?  When will we have killed enough innocents to revenge the deaths of our innocents?

       More proof of abuse, and this time it's fatal for (at least) five Iraqi detainees.  This from Pentagon documents obtained by the  urlLink Denver Post .  Am I the only one who's really upset that this is being pushed under the rug?  We've heard it from their own documents.  From multiple different documents that have been leaked.  The evidence that there is something despicably wrong with this administration is both undeniable and bountiful.  Is there a reason why these people have not been prosecuted for committing murder?  The US has been a willing participant in torture and murder.  I just don't understand why this is tolerated, why Bush hasn't been impeached, why Rumsfeld refuses to resign, why the lowest-ranked military people involved have been offered up as sacrificial lambs with no accountability for the higher-ups that ordered these abominations.  Or rather, maybe I do understand and that's what truly frightens me.  Bush is a dictator of the worst stripe.  We impeached Clinton for lying about who he slept with, but we won't impeach Bush for condoning terrorism, torture, and murder?  Please, America, stop this tyrant in the November elections before his policies of colonialism and terrorism engulf us all.  He is no Republican.  He is a fascist.   Brutal interrogation techniques by U.S. military personnel are being investigated in connection with the deaths of at least five Iraqi prisoners in war-zone detention camps, Pentagon documents obtained by The Denver Post show.

       So, no one really thinks that we will be able to get out of Iraq by June 30th.  That includes Europe, primarily France and Germany.

       Screw the Geneva Conventions.  Interrogators at this  urlLink secret prison facility  violate the Geneva Conventions with reckless abandon.   These sources say the prisoners there are hooded from the moment they are captured. They are kept in tiny dark cells.

        urlLink More pictures  surface.  This time, they picture soldiers gloating over the dead body of an Iraqi detainee who died during interrogation.  Hmmm.  Can anyone say homicide?  Certainly the lower-ranking soldiers deserve to be punished.  However, more evidence is surfacing all of the time that this is a wide-spread practice, condoned by the highest levels of government.  This includes Rumsfeld, the CIA, and the FBI.  Doesn't it seem like some of those organizations should be held accountable?  For instance, why are we going after the people who are giving the thumbs-up sign next to the corpse, but not the person/people who killed this detainee during interrogation?

       Another  urlLink soldier with integrity  comes forward to state that the abuse in Iraqi prisons was not isolated behavior by a few "bad apples."  In my mind, these are the soldiers with the real courage.  Those who will stand up, against the crowd, and say that "This is wrong and I won't bow to orders that cloud and mask the truth behind a web of lies designed to protect the rich and powerful."  That is a level of integrity that, I'm afraid, we can never hope to expect from Bush or Rumsfeld.

        First, why is it important that you get your news from an alternative news source?  Many reasons.  If you grew up like me, then you grew up hearing about the liberal media.  I beg to differ with that assessment.  It may be true that individual reporters are left-leaning in many cases, but the major networks are run by business folk, and it's not good business to buck the people in power.  For example, recently  Nightline  was pre-empted in a cowardly act of censorship by the  urlLink Sinclair Broadcast Group .  Ted Koppel had decided to read the names and show the pictures of the American soldiers killed in Iraq, and Sinclair deemed this too political.  Despite the fact that the Republican senator John McCain protested the pre-emption of the episode, Sinclair effectively censored that bit of "liberal" media from about 24% of American homes.  (Incidently, many of Sinclair's executives have contributed large amounts of money to the Bush re-election campaign.)  I watched it, and it was something that everyone who benefits from our troops' lives and deaths should be allowed to see.   The alternative news agencies listed below are not wealthy, to the best of my knowledge.  However, they are staffed by people who care more about the truth and human rights than they do about a fat paycheck.  Those are the kinds of people that I want to get my news from.  I hope you agree.     Want to know how many innocent Iraqi civilians we've killed?  Of course you do!  Head on over to  urlLink Iraqbodycount.net .  Alternative News Source:  urlLink Warincontext.org .  Alternative News Source:  urlLink ZMag.org    urlLink Pesky Facts  about the actions of the Bush Administration.  In the first presidential race projected to cost over $1 billion, you might want to head over to  urlLink opensecrets.org  to get information about who is making contributions, how they're being spent, etc.  They do the research on a lot of the information that is required to be made public, but that most people never bother to check on.   urlLink MichaelMoore.com : The Oscar-winning film-maker who brought us  Bowling for Columbine  and  Roger and Me  is now being censored by Disney for his latest film,  Farenheit 9/11 , which criticizes the Bush family.  Anyone who has read the film's namesake,  Farenheit 451  by Ray Bradbury, cannot miss the irony that Moore's film is being censored.  Funny in the most depressing way possible.  Allegedly, Disney is afraid of losing millions of dollars in tax breaks in Florida if they put out a film criticizing the family of Jeb Bush.  Cowards!  Tune into Michael Moore's Web Site for continuing developments.   urlLink Democracy Now! : One of America's premier alternative news resources.  Want to get upset about what America is really up to behind closed doors?  This is the perfect place for you.   urlLink Amnesty International : The organization that has been documenting the civil rights abuses and war crime violations (committed, in particular, by the U.S.) in Iraq for months before it came to light on CBS's  60 Minutes II .  A great organization to join if you are protesting America's terror campaigns against the people of other countries, or against the people of our own country.  They are fighting for human rights around the world.  One of the best organizations out there today if you want to make a change in the world.  Amnesty International's  urlLink Take Action  site.  A fantastic site where you can find things that you can actually do to protest in your little corner of the world.  They have action items with letters that you just click on the send button to shoot out via e-mail, or print out and address the old-fashioned way.  Perhaps best of all, they have a list of things that they have accomplished for human rights, and the list is impressive.  I can't urge you strongly enough to sign up today.  Another alternative news source:  urlLink Alternet.com   Sign John Kerry's  urlLink petition  to remove Rumsfeld from office.  Over 320,000 people have already signed it.  Still believe the bologna about it being a few isolated instances that are not sanctioned by the military?  Then read the specific articles below.  The winner of the longest entry name!  Now you've got to check it out!   urlLink http://www.johnkerryisadouchebagbutimvotingforhimanyway.com .  The site is still under construction, but it is written by a self-confessed unpolitical dude.  I quote: "To draw an analogy of sorts, one can liken my political awareness in general to the obese next door neighbor who never ventures from his residence: only in the event of flames springing from the roof and smoke cascading out the windows will this chubby recluse ever see the light of day. Well, the house is burning down, and as I wipe the sweat from my proverbial quadruple-chin, my beady eyes squint in awesome radiance of the sun."

       A new  urlLink book  due out soon makes the claim that the president is a paranoid figure who is emotionally immature and incapable of leading the world.  He is in a state of arrested, but untreated, alcoholism that feeds into his sadistic tendencies, claims the author of the book, Dr. Justin Frank, a high profile doctor of mental health.  What does that say about his followers, I wonder?   Even worse, Dr. Frank concludes, the President's years of heavy drinking "may have affected his brain function - and his decision to quit drinking without the help of a 12-step program [puts] him at far higher risk of relapse."

The document was criticized as "inaccurate and...politically manipulated by the Bush administration." When the report was released it April, "senior Bush administration officials immediately hailed it as objective proof that they were winning the war on terrorism." Now State Department officials acknowledge "they underreported the number of terrorist attacks in the tally for 2003." The revised figures are expected to reveal that in 2003 terrorist attacks rose to the "highest level in 20 years."
