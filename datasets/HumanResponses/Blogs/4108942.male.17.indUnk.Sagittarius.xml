       It's Over.  I found a template thats suitable.  Today was filled with storms, and cleaning.  I cleaned for about 5 hours, and it rained when we needed to go outside.  And it rained when I was driving.  Thats not fair.  BUT, my room looks awesome, and I have to work tomorow.  Not too bad, I get to work with some cool people.  But on Saturday, It's going to suck.  No, tonight, I COULD NOT go see The Excorcist.  My dad was being a butthead, and said he doesn't want me to do it, because I have track tomorrow.  Well, track is in the spring.  I'm doing Cross-Country.  Not track dad...      Anyways, I'm going to go now, and listen to some cool music.       Later

       Ok, Good news on my part. On Monday, I finally have an interview with the Theater. This means, that, if hired, I won't have to work in that infernal Bob Evans anymore. The people there are nice, but, no, no more food. Concessions doesn't count, because it's popcorn, and hotdogs. Thats not "food".      I don't know what to blog about. I just sat here for five minutes, thinking what to blog about. Hmmmmm........      Nope, nothing's coming to mind. Oh, funny story, that Aaron's already heard, but funny nonetheless. Today at work, the Chinese pony league team came in to eat, all 27 of them, and they sat everywhere. A waitress came up and said, ok, what can I get you to drink? The chinease kids said kjsdj dsjkhfhsdaja jf.....and the waitress said, "I don't know what the fuck you just said."       It was so so so so so so so very funny.      Later      p.s. Facket, is........still alive. He's in Iceland on holidays, Heath...

      No, not really, this isn't about pogs, sorry heath  I'm trying to type this, but I have like seven thousand people talking to me. It's rather annoying, and one of them is explaining a lot of stuff to me. Today was filled with enjoyment, as my best friend and myself went to Budd Bear, to look at the cool STi!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOO. There was a Corvette that was just, KICKASS. It was an automatic, BOOO, but the speedometer went to 200, so, it compensated for the lack of the manual transmission.  Then we went to Panera, and we, um, disposed of, our...."trash". That's right, we were good Samaritan, and got rid of our trash.  But alas, my dad is still upset about me not wanting to run Cross Country. He's still giving me the cold shoulder. And it's rather annoying, being that he's my dad. I guess all I needed was some time away, and the time with Aaron helped a lot too. He's a great pall when it comes to that sort of thing.  I'm done, I'm bored, and I have a lot of cleaning to do!

      ok, this is my tenth post, awesomeness.  (happy)  ALSO, it was the third time I have been at the sunday night alive.  (sad) This is sad because I got to meet the new bass player, and he lives in bethel park, and has to drive out there every sunday.  That makes a lot of sense.  Doesn't it?  NO, the answer is no.  If you said yes, you're wrong.  Work was just super.......................................flous.  HA, I bet I had you convinced I was saying super, but no, it was really unnecessary for me to be there today.  Yes, it was a Sunday, but there was 1, thats right, 1 table at one point and time.  4 people, 1 table, all the othes were empty.  It was awesome, I got to stand around, but at the same time, I can't wait to quit, If I have the chance...Come on theater!  Tomorrow is monday, and I have nothing to do.  Someone tell me what to do,  because I'm plum out of ideas.  I wanna do something, anything, but I probably won't, because I'm in trouble with the law.  The law being my father.  Supposidley, cross counrty starts tomorrow morning, and I don't wanna run, but my dad swore he knows what running's like, yeah right, he sure does.  My coach is getting on my nerves, and I'll only drag the team down.  Oh well, I'm dont blabbering.  Later

       Today SUCKED.      I had to work, and it has never been that boring, EVER!!  Then after, I went to visit Aaron, but he was done, so we waited for heather and jon to come out of a movie, and went to pizza hut with them.  It was fun...But I was sad the whole time, because I still miss heather.  Ah well.      The I took a movie back, and followed an STi for a long time.  It was so cool.  It sped up, with no problem at all, and the muffler was about 3 or 4 inches from the ground. OOOOOOOOOOOO      Okay, I'm gonna go now, because I have to work tomorrow, and it'll suck a lot.      Later

       I don't know why I'm posting today.  I have nothing to say.  I have to work tomorrow.  10 a.m. until 6 p.m.  You know, thats going to suck.  Because I want to work at the theater with my bedt homeboy Aaron.  But, as you know, sinse that makes too much sense, it probably won't happen.      Led Zeppelin keeps me going anyways.  I am soooooooooooooooooooooooo down in the dumps.      Sunday, I work the same hours.  16 hours of work will suck so so so so so very much, I can't describe it.  And I'm low on gas, poop.  Oh well      Later

       Why is it cold today? I don't know. I had to get some ritas for my dad, and i got money for the Senior Breakfast, which is tomorrow. It's going to be cool, except for crazy stacy. She can stay home. Band was annoying, because now that we have all 3 songs finished, with drill, we have to do complete run throughs, and thats what tomorrow's going to be. Run throughs. So I get to hear Earl not play, then blast the last note of the song.       It took me about 3 hours to finally log onto this, but now that I'm on it, I don't want to close window. So I might not. But that leaves it open for my sister to read these, and post something, and then everyone will be like you're gay.      Not too much else happened today, so I think I'll split, and talk to my peeps on AIM!      Later

       This blogger is really starting to aggrivate me. A lot. I can't log on, and this is a reoccuring occasion.  Enough!  I can't believe how hot it is in my house! It's hotter inside than it is outside, by like 20 degrees. I don't care. Band's still hard, and I wait to come home and talk to Aaron, Heath, and Brad online. Thats all i want to do when I get home. But there is always something thats urgent, that if I put it off for like an hour, the Earth will explode. That seems to happen a lot.  Taco Bell has a curse. If you eat there, you'll suffer later. Oh, the funniest thing happened there. I was eating there with Ryan, and he farted, but it was quiet, so I said he should make the next one louder. So he did, and it was very loud. We laughed really hard for a while, then it made me fart, and it was extremely loud, and this caused the man sitting across the restraunt to look at me. His name was Ed, huge ugly man. He was pissed. It was so funny. We cried. Then Ryan farted again, and it was long, and loud. We had to leave. BUT, as we were about to leave, Potato came and sat down.  He talked about hos he hasn't had sex in 3 weeks. He is deprived, I'll tell you. He went on and on, and then he told us why he reeked, because he was digging through the dumpster behind the place. He thought someone threw away his retainer, so we went in the dumpster, and looked for it. He was so dirty, and smelly. It was very funny. Then we left, and I went to the mall with Ryan, then I came home.  Later. Adam

       Thats right...My dignity is gone, pride, BOOM, vanashed. :-D No, not really, it was very funny to see so many guys in a dress. Sinse having listened to Brad, My life has already turned around, and I've been having so much fun.  Now only if I can get a job at the theater, because I dred going back to bob evans. The managers are horrible.  But Band camp for some reason seems to get hotter everyday. Not to mention the thermometer in my Jeep is broken, so it says like 108 when it sits in the sun, it's very funny. Because it seems like it's that hot.  Now, everything woud be perfect if I could play my instrument...  Later!    We Like to party, we like, we like to party!!!!!!!! da da da da da daaaaaaaa daaaaaaaaa

       ok, ok, fine.      From now on, I'm going where ever the wind takes me.  I'm a free spirit now.  No one can convince me otherwise.  It took a very good friend to convince me of this.  His name is Brad.  He told me to wait for whatever comes along.  I was in too much of a hurry, trying to rush things that weren't supposed to be.        I need to rethink a lot of whats been happening...      Later      I've been   Dazed and Confused   for so long...

       Wow! Band's a killer! For about the first 3 hours, we were outside in the heat! It was so freaking hot! But, to our luck, we got to go in, when the woodwinds had to sit in the sun at 2, and that's the hottest part of the day! So......HA      Oh, Today, I got to see what made me sick. I saw who I want to be my lady friend, lets call her, Ms. A. I saw Ms. A with someone else, but she had already said she liked him, BUT, she also said that he rejected her. So that gives me a chance. Slim to none, but it's more than I had before. Also, I am getting sick of a person I play my instrument with. There's a part in the music, where we can either play an F, which is the top line of the staff, or we have the option to octave it, which is 4 lines above it. It's hard to play, and he's always like, hey, listen to me, BLAH BLAH, I can play it, blah b;ah, and I finally got sick of it, after he said "there, did you hear it?", I finally said "shut the hell up and play the damn music!!!!!!!!"      That shut him up. But I don't care if that's mean, his head is the size of the moon. Anyways, I am in need of some talent, as I will be asking someone if I can play the bass in a church band. It sounds like loads of fun, and I'm really up for it. I'm serious, I might not buy this kids stuff, but I still want to play another instrument, after the guitar, the bass sounds like awesome fun.       that's all I have to say right now, Talk to you later.   (you as in probably just heath)      :)

         Finally, I have a Blog thingie... Maybe someone will read it. My past week has been a disaster. Well, the fact that I stayed with my best friend for a week kicked butt, but also the fact that I found out some horrible tihngs was a kick in the pants. And then when I think I found someone I could have relations with, she tells me that she likes someone, and blah blah blah. So I sit there with a smile on my face, when all I want to do is stop the car, get out and cry. I'll tell you what.  Oh geez. I saw Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, and it was very funny. and I also saw Anchorman again, with what I thought might be my lady friend. maybe. I still have hope.  hahahaa. Brad just called me. He's a funny guy. Also a very nice one too. Anyways, I'm not having luck with anything this past week, so I think I'll stop while I'm ahead, and let other people be happy, because I'm not allowed to be. Nope. Because when I'm happy, no one else is, and when I'm unhappy, everyone seems to be having great fun. And when I have a lady friend, everyone else breaks up, and when I have a break up, everyone finds someone else. I am sick of it, so I'll stay unhappy for a while.  I'm seeing in another light
