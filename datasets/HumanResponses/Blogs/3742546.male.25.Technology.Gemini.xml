      Hello again.  I returned from Wisconsin yesterday.  I woke up with a nasty headache that morning.  I had calls from two people who wanted to get together that night, but I was too exhausted.  So I just sat home and hacked around on the comp.  I had my job interview today.  It was one of those group interviews, so it was easy.  All I had to do was say a few things about myself and read from a manuscript.  It can't get much easier than that.  It seems like a nice place to work.  It's only a temporary job, but it'll allow me to get some money saved.  I guess I'll try getting more images together for my sister's website.  Until next time, See ya 'round

      Yesterday was good.  I spent time with my friends Joe and Jason.  We played Settlers of Catan and Serious Sam.  We also went to CompUSA.  Today I went to my sister's house to start her website for her.  I didn't get much done with it although I was there most of the day.  I had some struggles with globat's interface.  They don't support shell access and you I couldn't connect with an FTP client.  So, I had to use their integrated upload interface.  That gave me some troubles for a while.  But now I have a better understanding of how to get around.  The site itself is very crude right now.  I have to rearrange some things.  As for now, I'm going to work on some background images.

      I got to see Joan over the past few days.  We visited her friend Suzy in Hinsdale.  Then, Joan had to go back to Wisconsin.  I'm going to visit her there on Monday.  Joe came over after dinner and we went to guitar center for some strings.  I have some pretty good news about the job hunt.  I actually got a call back a couple of days ago from the temp agency.  I have to go in for a group interview.  It's a governmental surveying job.  They're going to pay me what I'm asking for, but the job sounds kind of mind-numbing.  It'll be temporary through November though so I don't have to suffer indefinitely.  Hopefully it's not as boring as it sounds.  Until then, I'm going to keep sending out the resumes and working on my Settlers of Catan clone.      urlLink      urlLink      urlLink

      I've been searching for a new job for almost 2 months now.  Although I've been sending out many resumes, the responses I've received have been few and far between.  The most promising things I have going for me right now seem to be the 2 temp agencies that I'm registered with.  I got a call yesterday from one of them; something about a job with the government.  I don't think I'm bound to be too picky about it though.  I've called back twice and left a voicemail.  It's 4:58PM and still no response.  I'll try back tomorrow if I hear nothing more.  The good news is that Joan is coming to visit today.  One of her friends is getting ordained.  She'll be here soon I think.  I should get my scanner working again sometime soon.  I'll have to take a look at it.  It's probably just a driver issue.  I bet I'll need to reinstall it.  See ya 'round.   urlLink    Stone&nbsp   urlLink    Stump&nbsp

      I received bad news today. The company I was training for dismissed me from their project. I'm no longer working for them. So I got back to sending out resumes today. I got one good lead from my alma mater's listserv. The downside is that job would also be temporary if they hired me. They only need someone to do the job for about a semester or so.  Alas, I'll keep on looking and applying. Hopefully something will come along soon. until then I'll catch you next time.

      Well, I begin my job tomorrow.  I will be there for 9 hours.  It feels kinda long for someone who's been out of work for months.  But I'll make the most of it.  My friend Joe, lent me his writing board for the PC so I've been using that today.  Getting used to it, I managed to draw a decent picture of Odie.   urlLink

      Things are going okay here.&nbsp; I helped Joan move from Mauston back here to Chicago over the past three days.&nbsp; I have the day off, so I'm writing an entry.&nbsp; I've been away for the weekend so I couldn't get here to write sooner.&nbsp; Joe will probably come over today.&nbsp; Or, I might go and visit him so we can finish our game of Serious Sam 2.&nbsp; I want to see the end of it.&nbsp; I'll write later.&nbsp; Until then, see ya ' round. &nbsp;

      I had a stroke of luck today.  The temp agency called me saying that my second contact wouldn't be able to get back to them any time soon.  But the agency needed a second contact by today.  They asked if I knew of anyone else who could be a reference to me.  I said, I could try locating one of my old managers.  I only worked at two other places, but one of the companies went out of business and I worked at the other company a long time ago.  It was hard to locate anyone.  I tried the white pages and the internet.  Luckily, my reference called them back today.  Therefore the temp agency called me back saying that everything is okay and that I can keep my job.  I visited Hyde Park today because Joan was there.  She had to straighten out some administrative things with her school.  So we walked around campus for a while.  I updated my sister's website too.  I didn't have any of the font's that she suggested, but I found a new one that I think works really well for it.  Now we just need some content.

      I know it's been a while since my last post, but I've been real busy.  I've been busy with my new job which I've been selected for.  I went in for an hour orientation today.  I have to go in tomorrow morning for training.  They say they need a second reference which I reported to at a job that I worked.  The one manager wont get back to them.  I tried calling today, but I couldn't get ahold of him.  I can't get ahold of any other managers that I've had.  I don't know what I'm going to do about this.  Now I have to read a long pamphlet on their policies and procedures and do a take home quiz.  So, I've been working on this.  I'll try not to stay away for too long.  See ya later.

      Hello there,  I've been keeping busy trying to find a new job.  I had an interview on tuesday.  It went well, but I wont find out anything until about 2 weeks from now.  Aside from that, I've been pretty busy redesigning my webpage.  It's looking REALLY good.  It looks better than my last webpage.  I spent time with Joe and Joan together yesterday.  Then Joe and I had a discussion on the old RPG program that has been on hold for a while.  Then again, my Settlers of Catan program has been on hold for a few weeks also.  Hopefully I'll get this website finished soon so I can get back to some old fashioned programming.  Talk to ya then.
