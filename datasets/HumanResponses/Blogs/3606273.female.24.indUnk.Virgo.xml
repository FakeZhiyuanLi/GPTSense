      Happiness- God, I must have forgotten that it is purely a matter of choice.  Whether I choose to be happy, or I don't.  Whether I allow myself be happy today or not.  And when I woke up this morning, I said to myself "Girl, you are gonna be happy today..." And surprise, surprise, I  was  happy today.    How I could allow myself to sink into that dark pit for three whole freaking weeks, I really don't know.  Oh well... sometimes I just get so caught up in thinking about the little bit my life that's not going on the way I want that I forget about the rest of my life that has got everything going.     Was with S early this evening.  God, I love that man.  No matter what anyone says, I love him.  And just now, everything was wonderful.  And I'm gonna make sure everything between us stays that way.

      Guess all I needed was to chill with my polo mates.  And that book by Andrew Matthews- "Being Happy".  Basically feeling MUCH, much better than I have the past few days, weeks even.    Had lunch with J just now, he suggested I followed him and the RPPC players to Argentina in Sept or Oct.  Before that, I was online with N- she suggested I spent summer with her in Sydney.  Man... people are really coming to my aid. :) Perhaps I  should  take N's advice and lead a  hedonistic  lifestyle and live it up for a bit, just to chill. As barbaric as it may sound, it's really quite tempting. *grin*  Was just thinking: if J-Lo could just jump from Ben to Marc that easily, I should be able to manage similar things too. The diva in me thinking aloud.   Oh... TR seems to be head over heels into me!! It's freaky! He wants to get serious, and he doesn't even know me well! Hasn't even dated me at all! Talk about being desperate.  oK, the me I usually am is back.  Or almost, at least. :)

      Just as I thought my love life was a T-junction, it's turned into crossroads. Been stressing about S for some time now, losing sleep, losing weight, losing appetite, losing my sanity... etc. Basically I felt like I was sinking into some dark, dark pit.  Although I knew I had the option of TF (whose cousins had been wanting to match us up for ages and was really too good an opportunity to bypass), my heart was with S... or so I thought.    Last night, Z called me and we had a long, long talk.  Which really totally lifted me out of my depression.  I mean, he is the ultimate love of my life, and the only reason I'd accepted S's proposal was because I sort of got sick of waiting for Z without any sign that he was ever gonna commit.  But during our talk, he told me the reason why he felt the time wasn't right yet was because there were so many things he hadn't achieved yet.  He asked me why I  had  to settle down now.  I told him it was because I was just so sick of waiting for something that I wasn't sure was gonna happen, I was sick of being and feeling lonely, and all that.  After that hour or so-long conversation my spirits were lifted, and it gave me hope that we were meant to be together after all.   After we hung up, I talked to S.  Didn't mention anything of course, I still wanted him just as much as before I spoke to Z.  Gosh.... what am I to do now?

      It's been nearly 3 weeks since I last saw my boyfriend.  And I miss him like crazy.  And the fact that we've gone thru a lot of shit the past few weeks just makes me miss him even more.  Am supposed to see him tomorrow and I'm so looking forward to it.  I never really thought I'd love him like this, but I do.  He told me that he wondered whether I really loved him, or whether it was the bling-bling that kept me with him.  I told him that I wouldn't have accepted his proposal if I was only into his money.  At the beginning of the relationship I thought of just going for a hit-and-run, but I found myself having feelings for him as the days went by.  True, our relationship is somewhat unconventional, but it's all about give and take really.  And a lot of understanding on my part.  Unfortunately, he didn't quite understand that what I needed was  a lot  of attention, although I'd told him about it umpteen times before.  I really didn't quite care if he didn't buy me those Ferragamo sandals or that Longines watch if he could just devote a little more time to me.  I never thought I'd say this, but that Alicia Keys' song "If I Ain't Got You" really quite sums it up.    S was also wondering if my parents were trying to scare him off from marrying me with their terms and conditions.  I know they mean well, but sometimes, I think that what they're asking for is a tad outrageous.  Even if it's really for me.    Actually I was really kinda depressed on Saturday thinking about what me and S were going thru, and why I wanted to go out with Z was really to drown my sorrows.  I'm somehow relieved that I didn't go out.  God knows what I could've ended up doing.  Might have boozed the whole night long and ended up drunk as hell just to get stuff off my mind, but I'm sure as hell I'd have felt even worse later on.    On and off since last week, S didn't call me or answer my calls for a few days at a time.  And when I eventually got to him and told him I was getting worried, he asked me what I had to worry about.  It was as if he really believed that I was into him just for the money and didn't care about him  and us and would just dump him and look for someone else if he didn't have anything to give me anymore.  I guess he really didn't have the faintest idea of how I was crying till my eyes got so horribly puffy, how I couldn't do anything properly, how depressed I got.  Most of all, he really didn't have a clue as to what I really felt for him.  Partly it was my fault- I never told him that I loved him, and  perhaps  I got a little overzealous in asking him to take me shopping when I couldn't get enough of his time.    S, if you're reading this, I love you, I  really, really  do.    Oh, by the way, my date with M yesterday was ok.  The guy seems to be really into me.  I had a funny urge to kiss him, but I didn't do it, of course.  Maybe it was because I was feeling lonely or something.

      Woke up feeling much better today, 'cept that I'm down with the flu.  Can't have everything huh?    Was supposed to go out with Z yesterday, but that got cancelled, so went with my family to a family friend's place.  I think that was a better remedy than the night of partying I'd actually intended to have with Z.    Z's the guy I've loved practically throughout the time I've loved people other than my family.  Unfortunately, he's also the guy that's hurt me the most.  Still, we're friends, although sometimes we're friends  and  I don't know what else.  First love.  I've come to terms with the fact that I'll always love him, no matter what.  I told him that before, but I think he's got a problem with it sometimes.  Oh well...  M's taking me out for a drink in a few minutes, so I'd better get going.

      Unresolved issues have been occupying my mind for a few weeks now.  I thought a vacation would help, but it didn't.  All the time I was in Holland, I was dying to go back and get things settled, but unfortunately, I'm still waiting to get them done.  And that's not by choice.  And all my unresolved issues involve men.    Actually, almost all the problems I've had since my teenage days have been about men.  Well, boys then, but you get my drift.  There are girls who envy me, they tell me it must be marvellous to have swarms of guys after me, but I tell them, the headache is really not worth it.  To date, I've got a list of four guys into me (my boyfriend included).  Two of them are write-offs (basically don't meet my basic requirements)- so they aren't part of what's bothering me right now.  My boyfriend- he asked me to marry him, I sort of accepted, but now he's gotten into some shit, and suddenly I'm not so sure we're gonna end up together and that uncertainty drives me nuts.  Then enters guy #2, who's really the guy of my dreams.  I'm a prime candidate for him, but till I get that certified, I'm practically over my head in the sea of anxiety.  Crap.    Ugh.  Really must get out of this sea.  And quickly.

      Finally jumped onto the blogging bandwagon.  Looked kinda fun, so after a whole day of baking in the car under the sun, I decided to create a blog.  De-stressing?  Maybe.  Just so that I could vent, and people could read my friggin' thoughts. :)  Right now I'm sitting here typing, trying to thing of something to write that's really worth writing.  But my mind's just to tired to think really.  Maybe next time.

      ...I woke up thinking about S.&nbsp; Then I thought  'Fuck it!'  and dragged myself outta bed.&nbsp; To hell with that guy and that  hussy whore of an ex-stewardess .&nbsp; She ain't half of what I am.&nbsp; So maybe she deserves that sorry-assed cheating motherfucker.  &nbsp;  ...TR sorta hinted that he wanted me to go steady with him, again!&nbsp; oK, I'm not against giving him a chance, but he could at least like date me for a bit  first !  &nbsp;  ...I was cracking my head thinking of what I wanted from my life.&nbsp; This is like one of those times in my life when I feel like nothing's going the way I want it.&nbsp; Not with my job, not with my love-life, not with anything.&nbsp; The only consolation is that I've got my family and friends that really care.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  ...I was really wishing that Z, the ultimate love of my life, would just hurry up and marry me quickly.&nbsp; I so want a baby.&nbsp; With good genetics and stuff, of course.&nbsp;

      Guys who think they're God's gift to women... Smooth to the max, these sleazeballs.&nbsp; Gosh, does it even occur to them that there are some girls who  can  see that they're really sad and lonely inside?  &nbsp;  Idiot motorcyclists who don't seem to care whether they live or die.&nbsp; If I had my way, I'd run over them each time.  &nbsp;  Contemplating on a job... The money's good, but why do I have this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach when I even think of holding this position?  &nbsp;  Waiting for the ultimate love of my life to commit.&nbsp; He told me we'd get married before he hits 30, but gosh... that seems like eons away.&nbsp; Do I still continue fooling around the way I do now for the next few years?&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I really shouldn't bother about who I'll end up with eventually.  Things like this are written in the stars and eventually everything will sort itself out...  Newlyweds around me seem to be getting pregnant.  Is it breeding season?   Why am I missing the guy who's made me cry so much the past month?  I'm coming up with the flu.  Is it because I've been so stressed?  Have I really been  that  stressed?  Are flings really worth it?  I know they're fun and all, but then....

      Was out with KY and his sis and her boyfriend at the Shangri-La last night.  Just chilling at the lounge.  It was there that I set my eyes on one of KY's friends....  utterly, utterly gorgeous .  I didn't quite get the spelling of his name, but let's call him E.  When KY introduced us, we shook hands and for a split second, our eyes locked, and I felt like I'd been hit by a   thunderbolt  .  Sigh... We sat at different places in the lounge: me, KY, Nura & boyfriend were listening to the band, nibbling on sandwiches, joking around; E, his brother and another friend were having wine and smoking cigars.  Sobranies probably.  I doubt it was my imagination: I caught E stealing little glances my way.  Well, I was stealing huge glances, stares even, his way, so perhaps the fascination was mutual...  KY and Nura had caught a huge whiff of my crush on E, so KY (being the darling fairy godbrother that he is) said he'd try grant my wish.  Before we left, we went over to where E and company were sitting.  Nura & boyfriend said goodbye first, then it was my turn.... God, the chemistry was intense.  KY told E that I was a vet, and said " If you've got problems with your horses or whatever, you can call her..." To which E replied "Well, I'm the one with a problem..." and looked at me, then continued, "...are you gonna say I'm an animal then?"  I could only manage a smirk and said "Well......."  AAARGH! I practically melted right there and then!  What I really wanted to say was " Well,   gorgeous  , aren't we the flirt then?" Definitely a no-no.   So anyway, we're supposed to join E tonight at the Shang again.  And later on we should be heading to Velvet.    Could I possible get this guy?    Sigh..... we'll have to wait and see tonight huh?   E, if you ever read this: I have the hugest crush... whatever... on you right now.  It's rare that the thunderbolt happens to me, but yesterday when I met you, it was definitely one of those   thunderbolt-worthy   occassions.

      Life's been good to me the past few weeks. Possibly a getting a bit routine, but good nonetheless.  Things to be thankful for (listed at random):   Z has been there for me for the longest time this time and not done his disappearing act since.  I see R about once a week on average. We aren't having a relationship or anything, but he makes me feel    good   .   My parents are always there to support me, no matter what I've put them thru.  My friends are a wonderful bunch of people (well, most of them at least...)  Things God have given me.  The invisible bag of luck that is always refilled when it gets close to being empty, that I carry around with me.  My adoring public. (Even if their attention may be   unwanted   at times.)  Everything else that I consider to be a blessing to my life....
