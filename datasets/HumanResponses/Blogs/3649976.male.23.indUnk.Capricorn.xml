      “If you had three wishes, what would you ask for?” she asked.  “Let me see, I would wish for the world and all that money can buy,” I said.  “Understandable, anything more?” she pressed on.  “I would wish that I can travel beyond the moon and the stars,” I replied with a grin.  “That leaves you with one wish, what is your final wish?” she was getting sad by the minute.  “I would wish for golden wings,” I said with a big flap of my hands.  She kept quiet.   I held her hand and said, “But all that would mean nothing if you didn’t love me.”

      It was talent night. The hall was packed with people. After a week of gruelling qualifying rounds, we finally made it to the Finals. It is no World Idol but facing so many people was definitely a daunting task. Cold sweat could be seen on both our faces. Furthermore, what I planned to do tonight may just change my life forever.  We were scheduled to be the last performance of the night. Its either we end this talent night on a bang or we end it with a whimper. We crossed our fingers and hoped it was for the former. The rest of the contestants were good as we have predicted. With so much expectation placed on us to at least end the night on a good note, we felt butterflies flying around in our stomach.  The emcee introduced us and we stepped on the stage.  My flashback ends. Here I am now standing on the stage.  Nicholas	: This is it, Vincent. Its do or die.  Vincent	: Yep, this is it.  Nicholas	: To everyone, I would like to dedicate this song to a very special friend of 		  mine, Sharon.  Vincent starts to strum his guitar.  I’ve been here before, See an open door, To find my way into your heart, All you have inside, Is yours to sacrifice, Its just a way to make a start.  I don’t know why, So hard to find.  Is this really love, Is this really love,  Is this really lo-oh-oh-ve, Is this really love, That I’m feeling for you.  I’ve been walking round, Trying to hold it down, Its just the way it was in time, I don’t want too much, Just to feel your touch, And the chance to make you mine ohhh,  Once in my life, I’ve opened my eyes.  Is this really love, Is this really love,  That I’m feeling, Is this really lo-oh-oh-ve, Is this really love, That I’m feeling for you.  Vincent enters into his guitar solo. I look into the crowd and found her. I cannot see what is her expression but I certainly hope she is touch by this.  Is this really love, Is this really love,  That I’m feeling, Is this really lo-oh-oh-ve, Is this really love, That I’m feeling for you.   Song courtesy of an unknown singer – “Is this really love”   Nicholas	: Thank you.  I whisper to Vincent, “The crowd certainly loves us, let’s hope she loves me too.”  “Let’s just hope for the best,” he said.  He gives me a beaming smile and we exit the stage.

      It is never easy to love someone and you end up having to just like her. Yet that was exactly what happened. Hi, my name is Nicholas and I am the World’s Most Unfortunate Guy when it comes to relationship.  Its not that I meet lousy girls or get bullied into submission. I have nice friends who are girls but that’s just it. They are merely my friends – nothing more, nothing less. I was beginning to feel like girls are just there to frustrate me when I met her. She was charming, funny, pretty, sexy and all the things that make you swoon at her feet.  I could sense that maybe I have found the ONE. We went out several times and the signs seem positive. I thought she was there for the taking. That she was mine and nothing in this world could change that. How wrong I was proven to be.  In comes Eric, my best buddy who met her when we decided to go for a movie. They hit it off immediately and there I was, cast aside like some unwanted puppy who have brought two dog owners together. I never heard from her much later or even from Eric until that day in the shopping mall. When I bumped into both of them, his hands on her waist and I was speechless. They greeted me as if I was the one who was missing from their life with her cute smile and his sheepish grin. I said hi, remained calm and gave some stupid excuse that I had to go.  Two days later, she called me and asked me what was wrong. I had stopped calling her for a while now and I have even stop dropping by her place which was like two doors away. I asked her would she like to hear a song and she was surprised. She was joking that my singing would make her laugh and sleep and I said I was serious. She said ok and I dropped by her place with a guitar in hand. She was surprised nonetheless as Eric was there with her two other friends. It was a performance of a lifetime as I sang the song:  “Ehem, here it goes,” I said once I was ready.  I stopped sending flowers to your apartment You said you aren't home much anymore I stopped dropping by without an appointment Cause I'd hear laughter coming through your door.  Sometimes late at night you'll still call me Just before you close your eyes to sleep You make me vow to try and stop by sometime Baby that's a promise I can't keep.  I love you too much to ever start liking you So lets just let the story kinda end I love you too much to ever start liking you So don't expect me to be your friend.  I don't walk down through the village or other places That we used to go to all the time I'm trying to erase you from my memory Cause thinking of you jumbles up my mind.  You always act so happy when I see you You smile that way you take my hand and then Introduce me to your latest lover That's when I feel the walls start crashing in.   Song courtesy of Lobo - Don't expect me to be your friend.   I saw tears in her eyes and I saw Eric’s shocked expression. I bid my farewell and turned my back, never returning to apartment 401.

      I met her online. It wasn’t love at first sight, come on, it was online but it was certainly one of the better chats I had with a girl in my entire life. Her name was Sharon and that is short for Seriously Hot And Really Out-of-this-world Nice girl.   We hit it off immediately. She liked my wit, my humour and I loved her cute laughter and the way she relaxes me after a tough day at work. I guess good things do happen to me after all and she was certainly the highlight of my day every day ever since I knew her. It was with much courage and various bouts of nervous fit that I finally asked her out to have dinner and for the first time, chat face-to-face.   We continued meeting each other over the next three months. She was really pretty and I was well, average at best I’d said. You know how most online stuff just dies when you meet in real life, well, ours took off like there was no tomorrow and it was really great because she would laugh at my jokes and I would laugh at hers and we were clicking like we have knew each other for years.  By the sixth month, I thought it was high time to take things to the next level. I was all ready to ask her to be my steady when she called in the middle of the night and told me she fell in love with a friend of hers. I nearly dropped my phone at the shock of it but knowing that my T610 is really expensive, I managed to tighten my grip instead. She consulted me whole night on what she should do and with a heavy heart, I gave her my best advice and wished her all the best. After the conversation ended, I stared into my ceiling until the break of dawn – stoned, speechless and feeling like someone had just twisted a double-edged blade into my heart.  It took me a full week to recover and by then she was already enjoying herself with her new found soulmate. It was heart wrenching to hear her croon about how she is enjoying herself with him. I concentrated on my life once more and kept in touch with her sparingly.   Soon enough, she had to leave the country to further her studies and I agreed to send her off. I had finally decided that it was time to make my feelings felt even if it meant she had a boyfriend. At the airport, just right before she left, I pulled her to one side and said,  Sharon, Meeting you, Was like a dream come true.  Even if its too late for you to know, I love you, And it hurts me to see you go.  Sharon, At times of hardship, And when you are lonely, Remember I am always here. To lend you a shoulder to cry on, To offer you comforting words, To shower you with love, To hold you in my arms.  I hugged her one last time and she never said the words that I wanted to hear. But at least now I know for certain, that she is really happy with him and that I am really happy for her.

      It was a gruesome sight. Everyone was shell shocked. How could such a disaster happen? She was screaming in the distance. He was holding what was left of the massacre.  Their parents came running and her mom nearly fainted. Her dad had to hold her in fear that she would hurt herself. The boy just stood there. He tried to utter words of comfort but to no avail, the damage had been done. Such crime was not befitting for such a young boy.  Someone suggested that the cops be brought in but her dad simply dismissed such notion as overreacting. Maybe a doctor, he thought. But which doctor would be good enough? No one was the answer.  He started saying he didn’t mean it. She was wailing and screamed,  “You killed my doll!”  He sunk to his knees, the head of the puppet in his hands as he continued to mutter,  “I didn’t meant to do it.”

      I entered the old shack. It all looked so familiar. I guess Mom didn’t really touch it after I left town. I moved around looking at the stuff in there, reliving my past memories. I came upon the box. It looked the same. The same box that brought me my first love in that hot summer. It was not a special box, and maybe that was why she was fascinated with me playing with it all day long. The memories came flooding back and it overwhelmed me as I knelt before the box.  She was a great gal. She had long blonde hair and inter-racial relationship was something not common back then. I had just moved into the country and the community has never really seen an Asian living among them before. She used to climb over the fence and play in the shack before we moved in. That was how we met, when one fine day, she came in and there I was, with the box.  We spent every day of our lives together from then on. We could talk about all things from life to nonsense to scientific findings. I found my soulmate and she found hers. It was certainly the best time of our lives. I was 14 then and our relationship continued until I was 18 and had to leave for college. It was certainly a heart-breaking moment but we each had our dreams to pursue.  During those trying times, we had many arguments due to long distance and the pressure of our studies. Life sometimes play a cruel fate on you and it was during these times that I lost her. Forever.  Tears streamed down my face and then I saw a piece of paper in the box. It was a returned mail. The address was my old college address and the date was on our final fight when I shifted out of my dorm and never informed her of my new address. I read the letter and it only contained a poem.  If I ever leave before you, Remember me forever in your prayers, You are my first and last love, I promise you, I will wait for you, At heaven’s gate.  I held the paper in my hand as tears stream down my face. The summer that would remain etched in my heart forever.

      For such a person, there is only one name, Shockingly Sexy. So yes, that’s what I would name the person.  That sexy sway of butt as she struts down the corridor. That slightly dyed shoulder-length hair with a tinge of red can stun you from a mile away. Her long legs seem to stretch to eternity. Her hands scream for me to feel her soft touch. Her waist seems ideal for my big, rough arms to wrap around her.  I can imagine her sweet smile, her angelic voice and of course that sweet luscious lips merging with mine. Mind you, I am only imagining it because I’ve not seen her face before. I pointed her out to my friends around me. One of them grins like he has not seen tomorrow. Another burst out laughing. They were all egging me on to ask her out. I can see it now, The Best Couple in the World. My back was now facing her back as I breathe in and out. Summoning enough courage and helped on by my friends surprising support, I turned around to try and get her attention.  Laughter could be heard a mile away as I catch a glimpse of my friend rolling on the floor. Shockingly Sexy has just entered the male toilet.

      “Can we stop and just enjoy the rainbow?” she asked.  “It is just a rainbow, dear. We have to get to the registrar office in time,” I argued.  “Awww, but I love rainbows,” she started to sulk.  I told her that she can see the rainbow as we drive to the registrar office. She did not really like it but since I was adamant, she did not argue any further.  She is Sarah. Love of my life, apple of my eye, the one and only, you get the point. She is the most beautiful person I’ve known in my entire life with her long black hair and deep brown eyes. We were a match-made in heaven as many would say. The dream couple of the century and we proved it everyday to each other that we were indeed right for each other.  That was probably when I decided to finally pop the question. It was a no-frills affair but I made it extra special by proposing on her birthday. Maybe I just wanted a date that was easy to remember but that is for a different story. I sang her favourite love song over dinner in front of a packed restaurant. I went down on one knee, reveal a diamond ring and asked her to marry me. Needless to say, the answer was yes.  Our wedding preparations began even before we even registered ourselves. We figured it wouldn’t take us that long to register. Just a day, get a date and all will be confirmed. We went to wedding gown shops looking for her dream dress. It was all going according to plan and it was certainly the best moments in our lives. Until that fateful day.  “There’s a rainbow, dear and it will continue to shine day after day for you.”  I said as I lay a bouquet of flowers on her grave.  -Inspired in 5mins, wrote it in 10mins,cut me some slack if it sucks ;)-

      Our eyes locked. There was no denying it. We were definitely made for each other. There would never been two person so greatly matched. She had dark shades under her eyes, must be makeup. I was wearing my geeky spectacles. She had ruffled purplish hair. I had a nicely combed jet black hair. Her lips were in a dark shade lipstick and well, I had normal lips.  She was dressed in some rugged t-shirt, with one sleeve torn. I was in my best Sunday clothes. Her skirt was as short as they come and the jet black boots covered right up to her knees. My beige khakis, well they were nothing but just plain simple. Her tribal tattoo on her arms bewitched me while I tried my best to impress her with my latest HP iPAQ.   We talked like we had no time left. She had done bungee jumping and sky diving. My bravest thing – crossing the road on a busy Monday afternoon without using the overhead bridge. She had gone in and out of the juvenile detention countless times. My worse punishment – being grounded for an hour in my room. She dreams of living in the outback, cruising down a Harley Davidson, occasionally robbing petrol stations along the way. My dream was to live by the beach, sitting at a swing, sipping Margaritas while watching the sunset.  She inched closer to me as I inched closer to her. I could smell her perfume now. Her choice of Aramis was intoxicating. A rat would not have stood a chance. Meanwhile, I had a soft tinge of Calvin Klein’s Eternity. Her face was close to mine I could smell her cigarette breath. I, on the other hand had never even lighted a cigarette before let alone smell like one. We were certainly match-made in heaven.  I reach my hand out, slowly caressing her face and press the buzzer. The bus stops. I have reached my destination. Certainly the best 20 minutes bus ride I’ve ever been on.

      I use xanga. I use blogspot.  I am a blogger. Why am I using both? Because I have friends using this and I would like post tiny little comments on their blog. But can I do this without creating an account? No. I have to create an account and this forces me to blog. I mean whats the point of creating an account if I do not blog.  So here I am,grumbling about the lack of cooperations between the blogging sites.Bloggers should hold a mutiny and demand that they be allowed cross-site commenting. The point of blogging is for people to read and then post nasty comments on it without having to go through a 3-minute process of creating an account.  So now,I have two accounts with two separate blogs to write.Maybe I will just cut and paste. That way people of these two worlds will get a taste of my rants.

      This is a tribute to my friend from Japan who passed away. You will always be remembered.  Though the ocean separates us, Though our friendship was based on bits and bytes, Though we only talk about a game, Though we have a language barrier, You will always be remembered.  Be it for the good times and the bad, Be it for the best and the worst, You will always be remembered.

      When is a joke not a joke? When it is on you. When is a story not a story? When it is about you. It is weird that I have written so many stories, looking in from outside, trying to put myself in that situation to try and feel the same emotions and yet it is never the same when it hits you.   I’ve always told others that love is all worth it but is it really worth it? Is it worth the pain and the hurt? Is it worth the time? I used to say yes to all the questions I just posed but I am really not sure anymore. Because now I feel the pain and the hurt. And it hurts real badly.   You ever love a girl that doesn’t love you back? Been there for her but knowing friend is all you will ever be? Not willing to let go because you just can’t? Yes, I used to think that should I ever be in this situation, it will not bother me but the truth is, it does. It hurts me real bad to console her. It hurts me real bad to know that soon she will be talking to her a new boyfriend. It hurts me real bad to know that I will never ever be the guy that she will spend the rest of her life with. It hurts real badly because I love her.

      “Bitch!”  That was the last word I said to her. In a fit of rage, in a moment of anger, I have uttered the words that I never thought I would. She was the love of my life, the apple of my eye, the special one. I would never hurt her yet she hurt me. Kissing my brother was almost acceptable – I was even thinking of forgiving her for that. But knowing that they have been going about this behind my back for six months killed me.   You ever felt your heart stabbed? I never as well else I wouldn’t be alive right now but at that moment, I felt as though I could just keel over and die. I drove off from my house. I didn’t know why I did not ask them to leave but I felt I was the intruder. It was weird, she was my girlfriend and I felt like I intruded into her life while finding out that she was cheating on me. As I was driving, my phone rang non-stop. Her number flashed constantly on the screen and I repeatedly send her to my voice mail. Even my brother tried calling me and that got me even angrier. My own flesh and blood.  In that moment, everything blacked out. I did not know that anger could launch me into darkness. When there was a gleam of light, I saw a nurse standing beside me. I looked around me, it was a scary sight with all the wires. I did not know what was happening but I knew something bad had happened. At that instance, I felt like I had to do it. I called out to the nurse but nothing seems to come out. I took hold of her hand and mouthed the words paper and pen. She nodded and went to fetch some for me.  With the strength left in me, I started to write:  Dear Leona,  Those were certainly not the last words I would like you to hear for me. I would always love you and if you are happier with my brother, then I would surely back away. Maybe we weren’t right for each other. So, I would like to let you know that you are the best thing that happened to me. I would always love you, remember that.   Love forever, Nick.  My sight was getting blur and the strength slipped away from my hands. I saw her coming in. I could see that she cried. She came to my side and held my hand. It was then she noticed the paper I held in my hand. As she read it, my world went into darkness, never to see the light of day again.

      Some people would have envied me throughout my life. Born with average looks but with a charming personality, the talent to act propelled me to fame. After years in the movie industry, I got bored of the humdrum life of a superstar and decided to retire into real acting. By that I meant, on stage, live and when you make a mistake, its there for all to see. No directors yelling “Cut!”. Just audiences that will remember that one mistake for the rest of their theatre-going life.  As successful as I was, I never did find the one that could captivate my heart. I was a lady’s man and my conquest of the rich and famous is published on the tabloids almost constantly. Yet, for all the women in my life, there was never one that tugged my heart’s strings. All they did was fire my loin and those did not really last long. In the end, as famous as I was, I ventured online, using a fake identify, in hope that someone would love me for the real me.  It took months before I finally found the perfect chatmate. We didn’t have much in common but somehow, we could chat with others for hours. My acting changed drastically. Previously, I acted out of talent and pure talent alone. Now, I was acting with a renew vigour in life and with renew confidence that life isn’t so bad after all. Every show, I will leave a seat empty and in that seat, I imagined her sitting there, smiling and watching me on the stage.  You probably think that this is where I decided to make a girl’s dream come true by revealing my true identity and together we live happily ever after. Well, that didn’t happen. We made a promise to never tell each other our true identity. We were happy being chatmates and having a person share our joy and sufferings. Being total strangers to each other yet closed to each other’s heart. That is the irony of our relationship. We could walk past each other in the street and yet never know that we are sharing something special.  Needless to say, that seat in the theatre always remained empty. But the seat in my heart has been filled.

      It was there for the taking. I had to do it. Even she knew. There was no other way. Fate has pushed me this far, I cannot stop now.  It all began a few months back. She wouldn’t stop talking about it. I had it almost up to my neck hearing her constant rambling. Finally, I couldn’t take it and it led me to the inevitable situation I am in now.  My hand trembles as I reach out. She sits there quietly, not moving but of course breathing. It is do or die. It is now or never. There is no in-between. My hand reaches its objective and she screams. I scream.  “NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!”   “Can’t you differentiate white hair from black hair?!”

      Her      : How are you feeling today? Me       : The same, being hooked to all these contraptions isn’t the best thing right now. Her      : You know they keep you alive, dear. Me       : I know, but at times like this, I wonder if I should even remain alive. I am bed               bed bound and I can’t even spend time with you. Her      : You will recover. I am sure of it. Me       : I wish times were back to the good old days. Remember that time when I… Her      : Sang me a lullaby? You never stop telling that story! Me       : Well, that made you love me didn’t it?  She laughed and her laughter still brought joy to me when I hear it.  Her      : That is true. Why don’t you sing it to me again? Me       : Everything is gonna be alright, rock a by, rock a by… Her      : Everything is gonna be alright…would it? Me       : Of course it will.  I stifled a yawn but she saw it.  Her      : You are tired, sweetie. Why don’t you sleep? Good… Me       : No, please. Do not say good night. I feel empty inside when you say so.               Just let me drift away to sleep, ok?  She leaned down and kissed me on my forehead.  Her      : Ok. I will be here. Me       : Let me just see you a while longer. At least I can have sweet dreams of you then. Her      : You can always see me tomorrow.  My sight is blur now. I think sleep is really taking me over but the last thing I heard from her was…  Her      : Doctor! Doctor!  Darkness. Nothing but darkness.

      “I wouldn’t mind you as a boyfriend. You are a really nice guy,” she said.  Now where have I heard that line before? Oh yeah, every time I tell someone I like them. You must think that it is the line I love hearing all the time. On the contrary, I rather dread the above line because it is usually accompanied by,  “But you deserve a better girl than me,” she continued.  Wham! Bam! There goes my heart in pieces again. The sweepers have to work overtime today as they proceed to sweep the pieces of my heart and try to patch it up again for the next time this line is shot at me.  It is beginning to be such a norm for me that I am anticipating the same line every time I meet a new girl. Until I met her of course, the girl of my dreams, Desiree. No, not the singer. She was cute but not overly pretty, sexy but not totally slim, smart and has a great sense of humour. Best of all, I’ve known her for years and it seems so right to ask her the question.  Of course, I did not pop it right away. I actually talked to her, went out with her and received many favourable responses. It seems the stage was set and its time to bring out the champagne to celebrate. The fireworks in our heart has been set and I would finally be with the right one. Under the moonlight, okay, so it was more like a street lamp but it has to do for now, I asked her.  “I wouldn’t mind you as a boyfriend. You are a really nice guy,” she said.  Oh no. My heart was beating fast. I felt like dying. Please let it be a different line this time.  “But you deserve a better girl than me,” she continued.  Out came the sweepers. Out came the emergency surgeons to patch my heart together.  I sat in my room that night thinking. I finally wrote her an e-mail the next day:  Dear Desiree,  My soul is crying because it took such a long time for me to know what you try so hard not to show. I really love you to want me, just the way that I want you. And by right, it is the way it should be. I can see the want in your eyes; I know you are afraid to let your feelings show, but all I want to say is that it would only work if you let it be. I will always be here for you because I know we were just meant to be.  Love always, Nick.  My mobile phone rang. The name Desiree flashed across my caller ID screen. I picked it up.  “I love you too, Nick.”
