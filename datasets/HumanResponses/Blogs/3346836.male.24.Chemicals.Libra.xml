      I've just been reminded of something strange I did last night.  I know that I was retarded.  I had eaten a rather delicious pill somewhere around three thirty in the morning.  Nothing particularly interesting (other than a good time) happened until I got home and was on the phone with a friend of mine.  She just reminded me of a moment around eight in the morning when my brain decided to stop functioning for a while.  I went in the bathroom to brush my teeth, still on the phone with her, and then told her that I was taking too long because 'everybody is still in the other room'.  I was apparently quite sure that I had people over and I was wondering what I was doing wearing only my boxers.  I was mixed up and I was mistaken.  There was nobody at my house.  I was rather shocked to come out of the bathroom to find that I was alone, except for someone on the other end of the phone.  I can pretty much guarantee that this was due to a fairly large percentage of MDA in that pill I had eaten.  Much respect to those responsible for 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine.  Salut, Au MDA.

      I feel much better now.  I had the most brutal day, the repercussions of last night were severe and I suffered for a long time.  I finally went out and had a spicy caesar, which made me feel a little better, then some smoked meat from Schwartz's which fixed me up even more.  I then went to see my good friend's band play at some bar.  I have said it before and I'll say it again...Without Wade Sheedy on drums, Shikasta is nothing.  The other guys are good, don't get me wrong, but he makes it happen.  It's always nice to see him, he's a good guy.  I then went to meet a few other friends for another drink (or five) and some good conversation.  I found out some interesting details regarding confusing nights in the past.  All in all I'm looking good.  Certain people think fairly highly of me, I'm not sure why they think this way, but I like it.  It makes me feel like I'm good instead of an alcoholic drug addict with no real job and no hope, which I am not, I've got hope.  While I was out with them some little thugged out guys got in a ruckus outside and someone got their head put through the front window of the bar.  The sound of a pane of glass that large smashing on the ground is shocking to say the least.  Nobody drinking inside the bar got hurt, which is good.  All the excitement died out fairly quickly though, cops came, we drank, we left, I came home.  Then the phone call.  My baby, my girl, my best friend, my Dennise.  Drunk as fuck in Toronto, telling me that she puked in some guy's car, smashed all the ashtrays in her house, spit on someone, ate a sub that she now feels guilty about, snorted all her friend's MDMA and was obsessing over the Ninja Turtles and something called Pizza Throwers.  You know she's gonna be hurting tomorrow.  She'll manage though, she's a champ.  I can't wait to see her, she's coming next weekend for Mutek.  A few other friends will be here as well.  Party Party.  Salut, Au Diable.

      Someone recently likened me to Charles Bukowski.  I found that to be quite a compliment.  I suppose it has it's good points and it's bad points.  If you've ever read 'Factotum' you would really understand the bad points.  He never mentions drugs, just alcohol, but I'm feeling almost as tortured as the main character in that story.  I woke up around three thirty in the afternoon.  I've been on the verge of throwing up since then.  I feel weak and I can barely force myself to eat breakfast, though I know it's necessary.  The glass of milk is definitely helping my stomach.  My nose is fucked.    I ran into an old friend from Toronto last night.   I wound up hanging out with him until six in the morning.  When it comes to money he has no worries.  We met a group of girls from New Jersey, he took all eight of them out for drinks.  Lots of money was spent.  There was a bit of a blizzard as well.  I think I crashed around eight in the morning.  I also received a long awaited phone call from another friend in Toronto.  I've been wanting to speak with him for two months.  That pleased me, things could be looking up.    I'm actually amazed how much of a Toronto-related twenty four hours it's been.  My other friend's band is playing here tonight.  They're called Shikasta, he's the drummer, they're pretty fucking good.  So I obviously have to go out again tonight no matter how hurting I may be.  The past two nights have been pretty crazy, I'll say my famous last words...  'I think I'll take it easy tonight.'  Bah.

      I must thank all my friends who wrote comments regarding the entry titled 'Meditation on Intoxication'.  They are all very kind.  Thank you for giving a fuck.  I've also got to say thanks to the people at http://www.jerryandmike.blogspot.com for the statements they made regarding me.  Check it out after their 'toasty' entry.  Crazy compliments.

      I woke up drunk today, I don't remember coming home last night.  This has been a normal thing to say several times a week for several months.  I went over to a friend's house for a 'couple drinks' and ended up out at multiple bars.  I explained that I was poor and could not afford to go out.  Apparently this was not an issue as everything was provided for me.  It's difficult to say 'No' when someone really wants to buy you drinks all night long.  This seem to happen more often than I deserve.  I'm happy that I made it home.  I did not sleep fully clothed.  I took off my watch but not my earrings.  I left the curtains wide open, so I slept until one in the afternoon with glaring sunlight.  I woke up extremely confused.  I'm not sure why I feel the need to drink and/or get high so often.  There must be a reason or reasons.  I keep thinking that maybe I'm not happy with myself, that I need to change 'me' in order to change my habits.  I think there's a lot of sense in that.    I also keep wondering if maybe it's not me.  What if I do the things I do because the world is a boring place?  There's a feeling that I can remember all too well from when I was younger.  Have you ever dropped acid or gone to a rave (in the mid to late nineties)?  When morning comes and you see all the people who DID NOT DO what you just did you can't help but feel sorry for them because they didn't just experience what you did?  Do you pity them because it's just another Sunday morning in their mundane lives and you just saw or heard or felt the most amazing things in the world?   I'm concerned that this is the way I'm doomed to feel for the rest of my life.  I'm constantly on a mission to avoid being that guy walking past me in the morning, wondering why the fuck my eyes are so glassy.   So maybe I'll just keep going, drinking and consuming and slowly killing myself.  It's better than nothing.  I also thought up something interesting today.  When you do a half-assed job you get paid twice as much.

      Has anybody ever wondered if the girl from That 70's Show who does the voice of Meg on Family Guy was just 'really into' the show and kind of snaked the part from the girl who did it in the first place?  And if so, how pissed off was the original girl?   Just a thought.  I also got to see my friend's big toe which had been crushed and there's really only half a big toe there.  He did it driving a forklift.  It looks like it must have been fucking painful.  Especially because he said they didn't give him any drugs for about four hours.  They then gave him morphine and later an epidural.  I would not have enjoyed having this experience.  That's an injection into the spine.  That would be unpleasant.

      It's a new day.  The residual pain from the weekend is fading nicely.  This was the first time since I've moved that I got truly messed up for an extended period of time.  It's so easy to forget the after effects.  It's ok though, one day I'll learn.  One day.  I also can't stop thinking that I want to go back to Toronto.  I've decided that if I do not have a good job by the end of June I'm going to give one month's notice to my landlord and move back for August first.  I can't help but think that this city is a good place to visit and party, but I think I'm more suited to life in Toronto.  I have definitely learned a few things living here and made some decisions regarding the future.  If that's all I end up gaining from these few months, so be it, that works.  Then again, maybe if I find a good job and some more people to chill with, I'll change my mind and stay.  I suppose I'll have to give it some more time.    Thirty six days to be exact.  So that's it, an open challenge to Montreal to impress me a little more, give me a good job and show me that this city is as cool as everybody seems to think it is.  I'm waiting...

      I'm hurting.  We got absolutely retarded yesterday.  Piknic Electronik was cool.  We drank a bottle of Vanilla Vodka on no sleep, I jumped in a kiddy pool fully clothed.  I don't really remember much after that.  I'm not sure when we left.  I know that I went to Circus on Saturday night, the boys got sick of waiting outside so they went to Aria instead, I ran into a guy I knew years ago and partied with him.  Got retarded with him actually.  I didn't sleep, started drinking again bright and early Sunday morning.  Continued ingesting various substances.  Went to the hippie fest at the park.  After the piknic thing I think I came back here and passed out for awhile...I'm not sure what the boys did during that time, but when they woke me up they had more substances for me to ingest.  I know that we popped by my neighbor's house at some point.  Then we went to Circus, big party with Derrick Carter spinning.  I gave Josh and Adam the pass I had for them, and they went in, I was then informed by multiple doormen that I was 'not on the list'.  They had already gone in, I had just eaten a pill.  I work for this club.  I was fucking furious.  There was nothing I could do though, I didn't have my phone because I broke it during the day, so I had no numbers with me.  None of the other promoters were around.  I was fucked.  So I stopped at a bar for a few shots of tequila and a beer and walked home.  The sleep was probably necessary but my teeth are fucking killing me.  I feel like I haven't eaten in days.  I've been surviving off beer, drugs, vodka and more drugs.  My body and my brain are broken.  I'm shaky.  I think I need to curl up in a little ball and rock gently back and forth for a few days.    Salut, Au Diable.

      I just got in with my boys.  Adam went to buy smokes, an addiction that's difficult to forget but not really missed.  I quit about seven months ago after ten years.  Josh just ran outside because he thought his jeep's alarm system was going off.  I knew it would be debauchery with the boys...lots of alcohol, lines of speed, strip clubs, etc., now we're back here drinking some beers waiting to do some e's and then go to the club.  The strip clubs were ok, lots of hot girls, but after working in one for so long, you know they're mostly just normal girls working for school or for a coke habit.  Either way, it's not that uplifting.  Fun enough though.  I'm happy we left when we did.  I think we're going to drink for a bit and then go to Circus Afterhours.  It can be pretty good, tomorrow is the night to go, but tonight will be fun.  Tomorrow it's Piknic Electronik for Akufen and then Circus for Derrick Carter (SICK house DJ), in between those two we may go to Kamasutra, an upscale strip club, for (two for one) drinks.  That is assuming that we're not too hurting after tonight.   Salut... Au Diable.

      My friends are here.  I'm drunk.  We're going to smoke some hash.  I'm unable to write anything interesting due to the level of retardation going on.  These guys want me to be intelligent or be stupid.  Either way, I can't be bothered...Beer and Hash, let's do this.  No cigarettes in my house.  FUCK YOU.  Bahhh...g'night.  G.

      To anyone who may be thinking along the same lines as my good friend Kathy, I don't have a gun and that is not my kitten .  Hopefully whoever took that hilarious picture didn't shoot him.  I must give the little guy credit though, some trick ass bitch pulls a gat on a cat and he's just like "C'mon Mahfugga, what'choo'gonna'do?".  That kitten is cold.  Representin' straight up gangsta shit.  Word.  Also, a few posts back, I mentioned that the cashier at the store is my arch-nemesis, which nobody found odd except for Kathy.  So here's the story Kat.  I went into the store the other night to buy beer.  I like drinking beer, probably a little more than I should, and since I'm in a new city without a real job and few friends to chill with, I drink more.  So I went and grabbed a Six, when I set it on the counter, this snotty little cashier slid it past the scanner where it made the expected beeping sound, looked me in the eye, and said:  "So, do you drink everynight?"  I was flabbergasted...All I could think to say was "What concern is it of yours?" when I should have said something more vicious like "So, do you work in this shitty fucking store everynight?  Cause if I were you, I'd drink more than me."   It really pissed me off, probably because she drew attention to a character flaw that I'm well aware of these days.  She may have been right and she noticed that she does see me quite often buying beer, but as a cashier at a fucking convenience store she should know when to keep her mouth shut.  I could have spoken to the manager and got her in shit, but I'm no rat.  So I just left, she knew I was pissed though.  She was quite uncomfortable when I came in the store very early this morning to buy groceries.  Serves her right, she looked like she thought I was going to lose it.  I was cool as an ice dildo though.   I think there's a lesson to be learned in this...Don't pass judgment on a person you don't know when they're a customer at the store where you work your shitty job.  Salut, Au Diable.

      What I thought would be an interesting night was definitely nothing special.  I met up with my friend, who is a nice guy, went to meet his friends, who are strippers, and went to the club.  I've known lots of strippers, and some are very fun people to party with, some are not, but even those who are fun are not fun all the time.  These girls were just some normal, moderately attractive people who really didn't have that much to say.  Just like a lot of the girls I worked with before.  Nice enough, but meh...How easily we forget.  The club was pretty fucking dead.  I think there were more girls than guys there (due to the free passes for girls) but still...Have you ever walked into a club and felt like you're only one of a few people there?   It's kind of disheartening.  Especially since I walked in first, by myself because the rest of the people were waiting for the second cab to arrive.  The music was mediocre at best, I stayed about ten minutes.  I was so god damn happy that I didn't do any drugs.  If I had done some speed (it was offered) and was wired right now, I'd be pissed.  Instead, I walked home, the sun rises earlier here than in Toronto because it's further east.  I crossed the bike path which is a pretty badass feature of this city.  I walked through Carre (with an accent, but my keyboard doesn't do it) St. Louis,  where they finally turned on the huge fountain.  It still can't believe that the cops drive through at eleven at night with bright lights and 'close the park'.  Not one bum on a bench at four thirty in the morning.  The fountain is nice too.  I stopped at the store and bought eggs, bread, butter and apples from my arch-nemesis cashier girl.  Now I'm home.  Sleep will occur soon.  I'm pleased about that.    Goodnight.  You know, the idea of doing speed and going out with a few strippers to an afterhours club no matter how dead it was would have appealed to me so much more a few years ago.  Tonight I just wanted to go home.  Growing up?  Getting old?  Or getting wise?    Hmmmm...

      Awwwwwwwww shit.  The boys are coming to town tomorrow.  I've got Adam and Josh meeting me late night tomorrow night, after making the long trek from Oakville I'm hoping I can suck them into some hard drinking and/or drug abuse.  That or maybe sleep, and get an early start on Saturday night.  I know I'll have fun but I'm not looking forward to the feeling on Monday when they leave.  It's going to be like I just did the last line of blow out of an eight ball, and I have no valium or hard liquor.  It's going to be a rough, sad, hurting time.  Homesickness at the level of a skull fucking coke hangover.    At least I'll get to see two of the best friends I've ever had and ever will have.   So much trouble coming up this weekend...Tonight I meet a friend from the club and go meet some friends of his who are strippers, I've had a lot of stripper friends having bartended at a gentleman's club for so long, but not Montreal ones, so this should be interesting.  Then it's off to the club we work for, tonight is the beginning of a new Thursday where apparently they will be playing 'erotic' videos (but not porn, I'm confused) on the screens.  Ladies free with a pass, guys, twenty dollar cover.  They want a 'sexy' vibe in the place tonight.  They instructed us to only hand out passes to extremely attractive girls.  Sounds like discrimination to me, but that's the nightclub business, if they have a velvet rope and they're turning those they deem 'ugly' away, I'll be mildly saddened, but I'll go anyway.  Shows how strong my convictions are.  Otherwise, I was a productive person today.  I watched Antiques Roadshow, either I have the television tastes of a seventy year old woman, or I'm a douchebag, or I'm fascinated by hearing how much old shit is worth, or I only have three channels and that's the level of boredom I'm dealing with.  I did a few hours of promo work, watched Simpsons, had a nap.  Then I got stiffed by my friend, I'm not sure why but I can pretty much guarantee that it has something to do with his girlfriend who controls his every move.  If he's happy, that's great, but I can tell that he isn't most of the time and I want him to be.  Meh...You can't fuck with your friends' relationships, it's bad for business.  I then cleaned the hell out of my apartment, swept and scrubbed the floors, cleaned the bathroom (tub too), organized, dusted, cleaned glass surfaces with blue liquid and did the dishes.  Once I was done all of this I decide that I deserved a trip to the store for some of my favorite drug.  Beer.  Which I am now sipping in a peaceful way.    I am quite happy that I learned to add links to my blog site (thank you Allie).  For anybody who needs virtually unlimited hours of streaming audio DJ sets, live performances, etc., go to the Paxahau link or the Betalounge link.  Excellent stuff is available.  Enjoy, I've barely even scratched the surface of these sites.  For now, I must go, but I recommend Cee-Lo's album, Green is the Soul Machine.  Solid hip hop and soul.  Really quite innovative.  Worth many many listens.  Also Luomo's The Present Lover, smooth, sexy, sultry (thanks Geoff) house music.  In addition to this, I've just starting reading Irvine Welsh's Porno, the continuation of Trainspotting set ten years later.  So far I've wanted to write down multiple parts, very enjoyable and I'm only fourty four pages in.  I hope these recommendations make someone happy.  Anyway, enough rambling...More drinking, my beer is getting warm, good thing there's another in the freezer.  Salut, Au Diable.

      When an alarm bell goes off periodically for no reason and keeps me from sleeping, I get irate.  When my key gets jammed in my door and I have to leave it there, I get even more irate.  When the 'concierge'(if you can call her that) suggests I just leave my apartment unlocked and she'll fix it when she has time, I want to fucking snap.  I'm not leaving this ghetto apartment unlocked in this ghetto building.  I've got a nice TV, DVD player, nice stereo, wicked speakers, computer, turntables, mixer, effects processors, a trumpet, tons of vinyl, CD's and DVD's.  I've also got people who mainline coke living upstairs, a neighbor who loves cheesy pop gangsta shit and an extremely dirty (and may I say, stank-ass) little alcoholic Frenchman living downstairs.  I met him the other night on the street with some friends, we were wasted but he was WASTED.  I danced around the street with him for a bit, informing him that he was my neighbor, he was having a great time, laughing and muttering and trying to focus his beady little eyes on me.  The next time I saw him, there wasn't even the tiniest hint of recognition in his eyes.  I can't say that I remember everything everytime I go out, but I'm not a filthy old man who reeks of booze.  I actually saw him one night at the store when I was thinking about buying some beer, and that encounter made me say 'fuck it' and go home empty handed.   The smell of bacon is filling my ghetto apartment.  I'm going to make eggs and toast to go with it.  My best friend once convinced my other best friend (they were dating at the time) that if you eat eggs without toast, you can die.  Tonight I think I'm going to a party with a kissing theme.  Supposed to be a kissing booth, a giant game of spin the bottle for about fifty people and other kissing related things.  It's at this club called Saphir, around the corner from my ghetto apartment.  How fun does that sound?  I just had a disturbing telephone conversation though, apparently this party was last night and I'm retarded.  I guess it's no big deal, I've missed many other parties but I do hope that my friend was wrong and this party's tonight.  Kissing is good.

      Beautiful fucking day today.  Sunny and warm but not humid.  Perfect outdoor beer drinking weather which is exactly what I think I'll do later on.  It seems like the best possible thing I could do for myself.  I'm all about self-improvement these days.  I went to the job placement place and paid them twenty five dollars.  I was late for the appointment though.  I woke up at one twenty, the appointment was at one thirty.  I had the common sense to call and say that I was running behind, and I was only fifteen minutes late so I think it's no problem.  The interview went well, I looked slick, hopefully I'll get a real job out of this.  I'm sick of feeling semi-useless.  Sleeping in for a one thirty appointment doesn't make me feel any less useless.  My friend with the fucked up ear is sad.  I am sad for her.  She met a nice guy, for the first time in a long time.  They've been chilling together quite a bit lately, but he's moving to China for a year in about three weeks.  She's feeling low already, but only when she's not with him.  When she's with him she forgets those sad feelings.  She asked me when she's going to stop feeling this way and the only thing I can say is 'in a while'.  I experienced a few similar situations recently.  Once with a girl who was leaving to move far away and once with a girl because I was leaving her to move far away.  There's absolutely nothing I can say to make her feel better because when you know that you won't be seeing someone you care about anymore, it hurts.  Even though it's been awhile now since I was really sad, I still think about those people who are far away and I miss them.  I'm sure I'll find someone else, just as she will, but the question is when, and in the meantime she's going to be fucking down.  It gets better though.  Even after it gets better though, sometimes you remember and it sucks again.  She'll be fine.  So will I.  So will anybody else who goes throught the same thing.  I think I'll go climb the mountain with her now.

      I can overhear a conversation out my window.  This guy is talking to a girl and another guy.  Half english, half french.  His girlfriend was throwing all his shit out of his window, his mother is in the hospital flatlining, he's fucking drunk.  His girlfriend is upset because he won't get her high anymore.  He's saying that she's pissed because he won't put a syringe in her arm anymore.  He won't inject her with cocaine.  He says it kills him to put a needle in her veins.  He's saying he's been in the military for nine and a half years, he was in the Gulf War.  He says that he used to weigh two hundred twenty pounds.  He's "not a violent person".  He's not "like this".  He says that there's no such thing as logic in love.  Someone beat up his girlfriend today.  The details here were fuzzy.  I think he said that she came to him.  His mother's dying, he said he told her he couldn't handle her today.  She flipped out.  He wants her off the drugs.  He lives somewhere above me in the building.  My cell phone rang as they were talking, they definitely heard it.  Voices trailed off after that.  I heard them come in the building and go up the stairs.   Coke shooting, flatlining, drinking, beatings.  This is true, this just happened.  Makes me think once again that I don't have it that bad.

      I was rudely awoken at nine o'clock this morning by my neighbor blasting 50 Cent's In Da Club.  Not that I hate 50 or anything, but he does sound like a retard with his jaw wired shut, and I bet he's a total dick.  This morning was important because I had to go talk 'Roger' about the prestigious Pin Monkey position.  I declined this career path, informing him that I would not be in town the weekend of June fourth through sixth because I had to return to Toronto.  I also said that I'd miss at least a week to a week and a half in August because I had to return to Toronto again, this time for the wedding of one of my best friends in which I am playing a rather large role.  The first thing was bullshit, it's Mutek and there's no way I'm missing Plastikman live, Herbert, Isolee, Jamie Lidell, etc.  The second thing was true.  I guess I just don't have what it takes to be a Pin Monkey.  Am I doomed to fail at everything?  Or just stupid things?  Then my day got worse, and more irritating, and more irrational.  I got in a serious pattern of hateful thoughts.  I hated every homeless shitbag I saw.  I hated every business man.  I hated every young person.  I hated the shaky old four foot tall woman with ridiculous vericose veins.  I hated the skinny east Indian guy in the (obviously) cheap grey double breasted suit.  I hated the sketchy thirtysomething semi-homeless looking guy with a durag on under his hat.  I hated the trio of skinheads with pitbulls.  I hate the jacket one was wearing that said 'endangered species' proudly across the back.  I hated the girl at the coffee shop who was slower than a tree sloth on ketamine. I hated the rain.  I hated the cold.  I hated being damp.  Fuck.  Then a meeting for promotions at the club I'm semi-employed by.  That went well I guess, many good events are coming up.  This weekend is going to be tough to make it through, four nights in a row of parties.  I expected to get paid today, I did not.  I won't starve, but I would have appreciated the money.  As long as I don't get jacked, I'm happy.  Besides, if I get paid on the weekend like promised, that's money for then.  Akufen at Piknic Elektronic on Sunday and then Derrick Carter at Circus Sunday night.  Hot.  I then made an interesting discovery of an office down the street from my house that specializes in job placements in Montreal's nightlife.  Bars, clubs, restaurants.  Exactly what I'm looking for.  The guy said that my experience was great and that he had nine new places that day alone looking for people.  I've got an appointment tomorrow for an interview.  The only thing is, this costs money.  Twenty Five dollars to set up a file with them, they try placing you in jobs, you have a week trial at a place, if you get a job due to the placement, you pay them seventy five dollars and that's that.  You've got a job.  It seems legit, but I'm still a little apprehensive.  The way my job hunt has been going, I think I should spend the money.  Besides, you only pay them when you get a job.  He said their success rate for placing people is high.  Meh...  My friend said that she tried to stretch her ears a little more today.  The holes in her ears are already the size of nickels.  She fucked up.  She said her ear ripped pretty bad, almost to the cartilage.  She said it looks like a vagina.  That's positively repugnant.  The torn ear is gross enough in itself, but to compare it to a vagina is worse.  If I think about that ear the next time I see a vagina, I will never forgive her.  Then home to remove damp clothes and have a nap.  Now I'm writing in this, then I'm going for a ride on my bike to my boy's house for a beer.  It's no longer raining.  Yes.  Much less hating going on now compared to earlier.  Salut, Au Diable.     I find it quite amusing that spellcheck tries to replace 'shitbag' with 'setback'.

      Yesterday in Montreal a man shot his wife in their front yard and then shot himself, their fourteen year old son witnessed this.  Today an eighteen year old was charged for stabbing a cop to death in Ontario.  The cost of gas is up to over a dollar per litre.  I woke up with a headache, went to say hi to some friends at the tattoo shop around the corner, got a job offer, and went to the park to read a book and listen to music in the sun.  I've got it easy.  I got a call from a bowling alley and upscale pool hall where I had dropped a resume a few weeks ago.  I was hoping for a bartending position.  They called me today saying that they need a 'technician', now I'm not really sure what that entails, but I know that I have no technical knowledge of the equipment used at a bowling alley.  I informed 'Roger' of this over the phone and he still wanted me to come in.  He made sure to let me know that he wants someone permanent, not a student.  He said it was very important that he has someone who wants to stay there 'forever'.  That was his word.  He wants me to work Wednesday night through Saturday night, until three in the morning, for $8.50 per hour with the possibility of a $0.50 raise after three months.  I will be a Pin Monkey.  I see a real future in this opportunity.  Last week myself and some of my friends were drinking at their house.  We decided it would be a good idea to fill up a backpack with beer and go climb the mountain.  It was a good idea, dark forests at night are interesting places.  When we reached a point about halfway up we stopped on a large flat rock to relax.  A little above us was a cave, anything remotely cave-like naturally arouses curiosity in most men.  So Alex and I climbed higher, luckily his cellphone had a flashlight built in, normally I'd think this was a useless feature, but not that night.  In this small cave was a few articles of clothing and a stack of porno mags.  Someone was using this cave halfway up the mountain as a personal jerk off sanctuary.  I found this to be absolutely delightful.  I want a porn cave.

      Tonight can be described in few statements.  A friend showed how supportive a friend can be.  And it's more than merely appreciated.  Another friend showed me a side of her that was completely fucking known, but forgotten, but known, but forgotten, but WHOA.  Another friend was upset over his girlfriend but got drunk and stoned with me and I've not been able to comprehend most of the conversation, but it's been enjoyable.  He's a nice guy, just disjointed, and that's fine.  Many interesting things to say, but some are either above me, or just complete nonsense.  I like this cat though.  Solid.  I've also gotten rather intoxicated, and I think that means it's time to cut this short.  I don't want to embarrass myself in writing.   I also offered to buy my friend's jacket when I leave here because it has the name 'Philippe' on it.  I naturally assume that most people in Toronto will think it's a spelling mistake.  Either that or they'll think it's Spanish.  Salut. Au Diable.

      This has happened before and it will happen again.  When you are trying to sleep and you know you're tired and you were almost passing out on the couch an hour ago but now you can't sleep and stare into the dark with quiet music on and all that runs through your fragile mind is all the girls you've ever loved or thought you loved or thought you could have loved and it may be the one from when you were fifteen and you're curious what happened or it may be more recent and you want to know how she's doing or it may be all of them at once hitting like a quick succession of slaps to the face and every slap hurts as much as the last and it's hard to sleep when you're being slapped in the face and there's always the same image of a sly smile being sent your way and the people around you may not have seen it but even if they did it wouldn't have mattered, to them.

      Montreal thinks of itself as the 'coolest' city in Canada, and Canada seems to agree for the most part.  I know most of my friends in Toronto seem to share that idea.  I'm not sure if it's true anymore.  The first month I spent here, I completely identified with that notion.  Now I just see a city filled with pretentious fashion conscious wankers more concerned with paying homage to the nineteen eighties than any form of progression.  Growing a neo-mullot,wearing shit that douchebags rocked in the eighties and listening to stuff that was crap twenty years ago shouldn't be the height of 'cool'.  Either that or a bunch of goat eyed retards.  Don't get me wrong, there was some cool music made in that time, but there's a motherfucking assload of stuff being made now that takes things to entirely new levels.  I don't see the need for regression.  The bar I was just at was packed with mostly attractive people, music videos from the turquoise and neon generation were on the screens and the DJ was playing a set that would have been cutting edge a long time ago.  To be honest though, I can't say that all of Montreal is like this.  There's always Mutek coming up, that gives me hope, and the Montreal jazz festival is coming too, that may help.  For now though, I'm not impressed.  Maybe it's me, maybe I'm too 'Toronto Techno' as I've been nicknamed by a girl I know...maybe I'm just missing the T dot, or maybe I'm right and Montreal has nothing on Toronto.  Maybe I'm just bitter.  Who knows?  In the meantime, I look towards to this for inspiration.  www.mutek.ca  Plastikman Live...

      I think that my neighbor wasn't home today...For that I thank him.    I think that my friend has good taste in books...For that I thank her.  I think that I make irrational decisions when it comes to what I ingest...For that I thank myself and only myself.  I think that I don't like tossing and turning from nine am until four pm...For that I thank what I ingested.    It's a grey day in Montreal.  Grey Day is a good song by a band called Zoot Woman, I highly recommend it.  There's a light drizzle and the constant sound of cars driving through a puddle around the corner.  My fan squeaks every time it oscillates past a certain point, which kind of negates it's quality as a white noise generator.  I can't decide whether or not to document exactly what I do on any given night, it would be interesting to see it written down.  It might also take away from anything I write down.  I'd like feedback.  Is it anyone's business?  Should it be?  Can it be?  In the meantime, I think I could use a few beers and a nap.  Salut, au Diable.

      Montreal is fucking weird.  The people here, when weird, are at the absolute peak of fucking strangeness.  As I was leaving the club at six in the morning, there was a white haired man, about fifty, with his arm around a girl, looked about eighteen, and a little thugged out looking white kid...All checking their coats or bags.  This trio (and they were together) were on their way in as I was on my way out.  Keep in mind, one room is loud-as-fuck house, the other is loud-as-fuck hip hop and reggae.  I found out after that the coat check girl told the old man and the young girl that they made a very cute couple.  The music was alright, but the urge to get retarded at five or six in the morning was fading.  Odd people and unfamiliar buildings stand out a lot more when walking home at that time.  This city is very different.  The earlier part of the night was spent playing with my friend's daughters, the smallest one was asleep.  Very cool kids.  Pure french.  Like to playfight.  The oldest is tricky and fed me surprise kidney shots.  When she was told that she was on my team, she patted me on the cheek, twice.  She also shook my hand in a way that ended with a pound.  That's a cool ten year old, especially on a rooftop at midnight.  Her ears are stretched.  If my neighbor starts blasting 50 Cent at eleven in the morning, I'll be vexed.  There's a good chance that he will though.  That's all he ever listens to.  Literally, for a month and a half, only that one CD.  Before that even, because my friend lived here too and he told me in advance that I'd hear it all the time.  Imagine listening to one album every day for months and listening to nothing else.  I can't.  I think I should make him a CD.  It's now time to try and sleep.  Maybe one day I won't have to worry about 'trying' to sleep.   It's now shortly after seven, my fan is an adequate substitute for white noise.

       urlLink    This was spray painted on the wall of a gas station in Montreal.  Maybe the poor spelling is due to a language barrier.  Maybe it's due to the fact that a lot of punks and wanna be activists are just retarded.  I'm interpreting this act of vandalism to mean that 'Irak' is the 'new adminitration' for the gas station.  I understand that Iraq does possess a large amount of oil.  I also understand that the states and other countries require it for gas and such.  But I do think the proper (fashionable?) thing to do is protest the United States, their arrogance, their president, his administration and their motives for the war in Iraq.    Wouldn't if be better to spray paint 'US controlled oil, paid for with blood' or something a little more anti-American and not so anti-Iraq?  Roughly ten thousand Iraqis have been killed while only around one thousand people from every other country involved have died.  When you look at that ratio it's obvious that Iraq is being dominated.  It's unfortunate that so many people are dying for nothing.    So it goes.  Maybe I expect too much from activists and people who feel the need to spray paint virtually meaningless slogans on gas stations.  Maybe that's why I'm feeling frustrated.  But is it honestly too much to ask that they spell relatively simple words correctly?  I mean seriously, administration is spelled exactly how it sounds.  Ad-min-is-tra-tion.  Come on.  Usually I'm fairly apathetic, but lately I have begun to feel a little more socially conscious, at least on a very small level.  Either that or I'm just fed up with my landlord, I'm not sure which one yet.  The lack of hot water in my decrepit apartment building didn't end until this afternoon.  That's almost two weeks.  I wrote a few days ago that "average people deserve to be informed before signing a lease with an indifferent management company who can't even provide a basic service like hot water" and I believe that.  So here's a picture of my attempt to caution those who are in a position to wind up living in slight discomfort.  This is written right by the building entrance near the 'for rent' sign.  Hopefully people will see this warning and take heed.  If potential tenants are discouraged to move in, the landlord could lose some money, and I think that would be just fine.  Fight the power.   urlLink

       urlLink    I watched my friend make crack tonight, I was quite disgusted.  I smoked it once when I was younger, I felt great for five minutes, I felt like shit until the next rock, then we ran out, so I felt like shit until I managed to sleep.  It's a useless drug and people who smoke it look and act like fucking losers.  Complete douchebags.  Crackhead wankers.  This guy I know bought a twenty bag of blow, which is a quarter of a gram, which is one or two good lines.  Nobody I know sells this amount in Ontario because it's pretty much a pointless purchase, such a small amount is fucking useless.  It's a teaser and that's all it ever could be.  My friend obviously understood this so he mixed with water and baking soda, cooked it in a spoon over a candle, and smoked it on a bed of weed and tobacco.  Apparently making this shit and smoking it is more economical than doing a few rails.  I think that if someone is going to do coke they should do it right, get good shit, get a lot of it, and do it properly.  After smoking his rocks, my friend was much more outgoing in the conversation.  He informed me that "fear sweat was much different than normal sweat," which immediately reminded me of the Simpsons episode where Bart gets a bunch of novelty items glued to his face with an industrial strength adhesive.  He was quite sure of this fact and laughed at me when I doubted him.  He then went on a long rant about how he used to wrestle in high school.  He said that "wrestlers are checked for ringworms, which are actually patches of fungus that are found under the skin.  If found, the area is sliced off with a razor blade.  A bottle cap full of bleach is then placed over the wound to kill the hidden stuff that 'they' do."  He then went on to explain that "this is not a medical procedure, [the wrestlers] do it themselves."  He was smoking crack made from shitty coke that was cut too much.  He was so deeply preoccupied with not wasting drugs that he ate a bit of his own snot after he had done a rail.  He was immobilized briefly after he first smoked a rock and he said he hasn't wrestled since he lost half his toe.  All of this was of course quite fascinating, it continued to be interesting when he brought up his family.  He described his mother as a "big sack of something filled with a liquid weirdness."  He also said quite plainly that she is "so gross."   On the subject of the rest of his relatives, he said:  "My family is so gross, except for my sister.  She's not so bad, she's just trashy like me and kind of gross."  He also said that his "mom had a beard and dad was very white."  My twenty two year old crack smoking friend's beard is better than my brother's, who is thirty.  I guess he can thank his mom for that.  He also described himself as having "displaced grinding legs."  Although he's definitely an interesting character, smoking crack is pure dirt.  Bonsoir.

       urlLink    It's nice waking up after a night of drinking to find the word 'kill' written on your hand.  Killing is great.  Uhaul is still causing feelings of rage in me.  They called me today to re-schedule my trailer hitch installation appointment.  After the fuck up yesterday I'm amazed they had the balls.  I'd like to give them a golden shower against their will.  They caused my friends to drive way out of their way, they caused me to spend money on gas for my them.  They caused me to miss Wynton Marsalis tonight and a party with Richie Hawtin, Carl Cox, Magda and John Acquaviva tomorrow.  They caused me to have to ask my pops for a favour and fuck up his week.  Even though I appreciate his help it means that I have to sit in a truck for quite a few hours with no beer, no drugs and probably no music.  That's no way to move.  I'm still unimpressed with the building I live in.  It's been more than a week and a half since I've had hot water.  I'm sick of bothering my friends for showers, their water pressure sucks and mine was kickass before.  At least I'm leaving soon, fuck 25 Avenue Des Pins, fuck Malchas Corporation, and fuck the new management company.  In addition, fuck the city of Montreal for allowing a landlord to treat their tenants like this, it's ridiculous.  I want to screw the company that owns the place without fucking the other tenants.  I want to warn those who see the 'for rent' sign outside, I want them to stay away for their own good.  The people who typically rent small bachelor apartments in second rate buildings are usually in a low income bracket, or are students on a budget.  These average people deserve to be informed before signing a lease with an indifferent management company who can't even provide a basic service like hot water.  If this were an upper class building on a nicer street, we would have had hot water back the day after we first lost it.  I guarantee it.  It's not fair but that's life.  At least there are things in this world that can help us forget about the bullshit for a minute.  Sometimes it's sex, sometimes it's a good song or a good book, sometimes it's somebody else's misfortune, sometimes it's drugs and alcohol or sometimes it's just a giant chicken that does what you want.    urlLink Click here.

      I hate Uhaul.   These filthy sons of bitches have fucked me in the ass with no grease.  I had an appointment for this morning to have a trailer hitch installed on my friend's truck.  I had a trailer booked as well.  My friends drove from Ottawa to Montreal yesterday, we went out and got wasted.  We woke up hungover this morning and my friend went to Uhaul where he was informed that they could not install the hitch until friday.  Friday is no good, I was ready to go today, my friends drove all the way down here to help me.  Apparently the reservation I made was completely useless.  I considered renting a truck instead but this is the most busy week of the year for people moving in Montreal, there were none available.  I spent close to two hours on the phone with Uhaul, I got bounced around from rep to rep, none of which were able to help me.  I finally told my friends to leave and decided that I'd have to figure something else out.  I found a solution, my father is on vacation right now at Mont Tremblant, he is going to get dropped off in Ottawa on July 1st, rent a truck there, drive here, pick me and my stuff up, and then drive to Toronto.  The reason he's getting a truck in Ottawa is because everything is booked up in Montreal.  It sickens me to do business with this company again but I really have no choice.    So my friends drove here from Ottawa for nothing, I paid for their gas for nothing and I'm sitting in this shitty apartment doing nothing because everything's packed.  I'm hungover and tired and pissed off and surrounded by boxes.    I should be driving down the DVP right now.    Fucking cocksuckers.

       urlLink    This is the album of the day, week, month and year.  I'm blown away.  It makes me wish that I still played the trumpet, it makes me want to get lessons, learn it again and then try to start really playing.  I'm honestly pretty angry with myself, I really should have known about these guys sooner.    I've been broadening my musical horizons lately, less techno and more rock and roll, less hiphop and more funk, less house and more soul and always more jazz.    The electronic aproach is cool and all, but man, the Dirty Dozen is some serious shit.  This came out in 1991, if you sleep on it any more than I have, it's your loss.

       urlLink    I wish I could work for my friend's landlord full time.  I got to his house around nine thirty this morning.  I helped him go shopping for materials for renovating an apartment.  I pushed the cart.  He took me out for lunch again, I had shrimp and vegetables and rice and wonton soup.  For an asian guy he really likes chinese food, that's twice in three days.  After that he got me to cut his grass, do some weeding and dig a little one inch perimeter around his yard.  It took half an hour.  I left his place by three thirty in the afternoon.  He paid me one hundred dollars.  So I was with him for six hours, maybe worked three, had a really good free lunch and made a C note.  I still don't have hot water in my building, that's a week now.  What if I had a real job?  What if I had to be someplace everyday?  Luckily I don't but I still like to shower.  I had to bother my friend around the corner to use his again, so considering that I made easy money today, I brought him beer.  I think that's fair.  The cat in the picture above is his, she likes to sit on my shoulder as I walk around his apartment.  Her name is Rosette, she's a french cat, which means that she's a dirty slut.  A guy I know here left last week for China.  He was going to teach english, he tied up all his loose ends, spent all his money in preparation, had his going away parties, and left.  When he arrived there was nobody to meet him and he had no job.  The school he was supposed to work for had burned to the ground.  Nobody even thought to notify him and suggest that maybe he shouldn't fly around the world.  He's back now.  All that build up, all that stress, all those sad goodbyes, just to come back in a week.  That's like jerking off for a really long time and never busting a nut, but a little more emotional and much more expensive.  I can definitely say that I have a new favourite instrument and it's the tuba.  Nothing makes a deeper bad ass sound than a tuba.  If you don't believe me get the song 'Remember When' by the Dirty Dozen Brass Band.  Makes me want to knock one out.

       urlLink    It's pissing rain and I just got in.  It's ten after two I have to be up in about five hours.  That's ok though, I'm getting paid.  I went out tonight to Parking to see Tiga.   I wish I brought my camera, it was pretty hype.  It was a Definiti night so they put money into it.  These nights are very similar to the Benson & Hedges nights in Toronto.  The decor was fitting, neon was everywhere, glowing patterns and skyscrapers made of glowing pink,   Tiga was paying good stuff, electro of course, but very housey.  His intro was some track from the DJ Kicks mix blended with his cover of Nelly's 'Hot in Herre', which sounds fucking sick on a big system.  A pounding 808 bass drum always sounds good in a loud club.  They also had a choreographed dance performance for this, four people in glowing hot pink attached to the ceiling by what appeared to be slinkys.  Kind of cool, very eighties, very Montreal, very Tiga.  He was playing good tracks and his mixing was pretty much on point.  It was nice that they had an overhead view of the decks projected on a big piece of fabric directly in front of where I was, I saw everything he did.  He was using two turntables and two CD players, and he looked much less effeminate than he does on the cover of his recent CD.  The high point for me was when he dropped 'Rocker' by Alter Ego, the dancefloor goes nuts for that track.  It was hot in the place and packed full of hot people.  It's usually a gay club but it's fairly mixed on thursdays, you get a nice blend of gay dudes, straight dudes, the unknown and smoking girls.  I would have liked to have eaten a few pills and stayed to check the end of his set, but I have to do some work in the morning.  I'd rather not be hurting when I get up at seven thirty.  Strangely responsible of me.  I was not in the mood for rain tonight.  I was not in the mood to be disconnected from the internet tonight either, I was in the middle of talking to a good old friend who is never online.  Son of a bitch.  Sorry Sarah, another time.

       urlLink    It's just past ten thirty at night and I have not left my apartment today.  I've been a little bit hurting.  I got freakin' wasted last night and did some filthy street drugs.  It was an underwear party at Saphir, I didn't even know that until I got there, I felt overdressed.  I had a good time but I don't remember getting home.  I woke up sitting up on the couch which is not the most comfortable way to sleep.  I took care of some moving arrangements today, I've reserved a trailer and got a storage space in Toronto.  It's incredible how something that I thought was going to cost around a hundred and fifty dollars can spiral into something that costs closer to five hundred.  That's life, nothing's for sure and everything's harder and more expensive than it should be.    I heard there's also drama at my old work in Toronto, people getting fired, people quitting soon.  If I go back and get offered a job I think I'd take it even though I'd rather work in a different kind of bar.  One gets tired of strip clubs after awhile.  Still, it would be nice to have work right away when I get home.  If I go back there I think I'll start a purely strip club related blog, it would make for interesting reading to anyone who's never worked in one.  It's definitely a fascinating subculture.  I also found a great band today.  The Dirty Dozen Brass Band from New Orleans.  They've been around for twenty seven years, I'm ashamed that I haven't heard of them before.  I only found out about them because I got an email from their record label, and I don't recall signing up for Ropeadope's mailing list.  So far I quite like 'Open Up, Whatcha gonna do with the rest of your life' and the latest album, 'Funeral for a Friend'.  Excellent stuff.  I must say that I'm still enjoying my new camera immensely.  I like the photo at the top of this post.  I'm sure I could find a lot of symbolism in it if I thought about it, but I prefer not to.  I'm going to see Tiga spinning at Parking.  Salut, Au Diable.

       urlLink    Ok, not only did I make money, eat free and get a bunch of weed today, but I have also been given a great gift.  This picture was taken through the peephole of my door.    A little while ago I noticed that my neighbour was moving out.  He had a UHaul truck parked on the sidestreet by my building.  He was going in and out of the back door of the building.  He was doing it quick.  It was abviously a midnight move in the early evening.  I am so happy at this moment.  To anybody who has read any other posts on this site, you know how I feel about him.  You know what this means.  I no longer have to listen to 50 Cent everyday.  It's unfortunate that this didn't happen a month ago because I'm leaving soon too.  Even still, I'll cherish every fifty-free moment from now until the second I move out.  I'm feeling a little emotional right now.  I've gotta go.  From now on I'm living my life fifty-free.

      I slept about four hours last night, not because I was partying but because I'm used to partying and I don't usually sleep until four AM.  Normally I'd wake up around one in the afternoon, today I had to wake up at eight o'clock in the morning.  I had agreed to help my friend's landlord tear apart the basement of one of his rental properties.  I woke up, ate some breakfast and rode my bike to the place.  The landlord picked me up and I had breakfast again, there was bacon involved and it was on him so I couldn't say no.  Then we drove back to the place.   I started by ripping down a ceiling made of drywall with a crowbar and an old rake.  There was a bunch of wires and an obscene amount of dust.  Soon after, a garbage truck from the City of Montreal arrived and we loaded it full of wood filled with nails, tile, broken drywall and dust.  Once that was done we went for lunch, there was an eggroll involved and it was on the landlord again.  Beautiful.  We smoked a joint and then I swept.  I did more sweeping in those couple hours than I've done in the rest of my life, and I've done a lot of sweeping.  I've had shitty jobs.  There was so much old dust, it was like working in a dirty cloud.  By the end of the day I blew my nose and it was black.  I made some cash, got a sack of weed as a bonus and biked home.  I now have a beer beside me and I just blazed one, so I think that's a good days work even though my sinuses are packed full of black stuff.  Next time I might seriously consider wearing a mask, I may have inhaled asbestos or some other toxic shit.  On the topic of possibly being exposed to dangerous things, the safety seal was a little fucked up on my bottle of water.  It wasn't broken but it didn't break when I opened it either.  It was like it was too loose on the bottle.  I drank it anyway, I'm sure it's alright.  I doubt that I've been fucked with, that was hours ago and I feel fine.  In case I become ill and cannot speak this evening, make sure to sue those responsible for making Aquafina bottled water.  It is taken from a municipal source.  Which means it's taken from tap water, and then they clean it up.  They use reverse osmosis and a carbon filter.  I'm curious how much money this company makes from filtering and bottling tap water.  Mine was from Mississauga.  Pepsi made it.  I'm most likely not going to buy it again.  All in all it was a good day, bikeride, breakfast, hard work, lunch, joint, hard work, shady water, hard work, money, bag of weed, bikeride, beer, joint, more beer and finally, chilling.

       urlLink    Earlier this evening I watched the news.  What caught my attention was a story about Molson Incorporated and the troubles it's having.  Five members of the board of directors have quit and one of them was a Molson family member.  There have been problems with a Brazilian venture the company made as well.  There is talk of a potential takeover and shareholders are upset.  That's all somewhat interesting stuff I guess.  What was really interesting was the statistic they presented.  Which was that Canadians consume almost two billion litres of beer per year and Quebec consumes almost one quarter of that.  The way it was presented made me really think that Quebec drinks far more than their share and that they truly are a bunch of drunks.  I was already suspicious of this and when I heard this fact I was felt that my suspicions were confirmed.  That is until I visited the Statistics Canada website and did some simple mathematics.  The preliminary post-censal estimated population of Canada as of January 1st, 2004 was 31,752,842.  The preliminary post-censal estimated population of Quebec as of January 1st, 2004 was 7,509,928.  Therefore Quebec makes up approximately 23.65% of Canada's population which is exactly 'almost one quarter'.  I found this to be mildly annoying.  The news made it sound like this was an impressive amount of beer that Quebec was consuming.  I really thought these people were complete sauce bags.  It turns out that they're only drinking their fair share, so what makes so many of them so retarded?  Maybe it's the church.  There's one thing I can be sure of, and that's that as Canadians we can all be proud to know that we drink almost two billion litres of beer per year, and that's not counting hard liquor, wine or listerine.  I hope that as a country we can come together and drink enough to break the two billion litre mark by 2005.  I know I'm drinking for Canada right now.    Are you?

       urlLink    There has been no hot water in my shithole apartment building since Saturday.  It is shown in all it's ghetto glory in the photo above.  It is located on Avenue Des Pins in Montreal.  I'd strongly recommend that nobody move in here, ever.  Luckily I have friends that live nearby who are gracious enough to let me use their shower, otherwise I'd be a greasy, crusty, grumpy motherfucker.  In addition to the water issue, the front door never locks properly so any crackhead cocksucker can come and piss in the hall should they so desire.  Also, the locks on the doors for the mailboxes have been broken twice which meant that all mail was sent to a post office nearby.  Nearby turned out to be very far away so I never picked up my mail, resulting in the disappearance of my last paycheque from my last job in Toronto.  I did eventually receive a replacement but I could have done without the aggravation.  Also, as mentioned before my superintendent works for Interpol and my next door neighbour only owns one CD, that being 50 Cent, which he plays incessantly.  Understandably, I am irritated.  I have discovered a fascinating website called Terraserver.  It provides satellite imagery of pretty much anywhere in the continental United States.  I have seen my brother's rooftop somewhere in California.  I have seen my friend Pedro's rooftop in Los Angeles, which coincidentally is also somewhere in California.  I have seen Hart Plaza beside the Renaissance Center where they hold the Detroit Electronic Music Festival.  You can search by city, by address and by ways I don't understand.  There is even a listing of famous places you can view.  I've already managed to kill a fair bit of time playing with this and I recommend it to anyone who lives in the states, has friends there or is just bored.  It's been added to the links on this page because I find it intriguing.  I also spoke to a friend in Toronto earlier this evening and she told me about a loft that has become available.  It is near the subway, not too far from downtown, fucking huge and very reasonably priced.  It has three bedrooms, I already have one friend who is interested, all I need is one more and we get a massive space for a good deal.  I've been to parties in this place before and I think I'd enjoy living there.  It's right near a Beer Store and an LCBO.  It's also close to Square Boy Four, a wicked burger spot with Ms. Pacman, a patio, great souvlaki and $2.25 beers.  Needless to say, I am interested.  My neighbour just got home and I'm being force fed the sound of that lovable, bullet-riddled, retarded sounding schvatz, 50 Cent.  I despise my neighbour sometimes, not because he plays his music loud, but because he only plays one album loud and it's not one that I like.    I'd probably hate him more if it was an album I did like.  If I had to listen to something I like repeatedly for three months, I wouldn't like it anymore.  The last thing I'm going to do before I leave Montreal will be to burn a CD of some good hiphop and stick it to his door with a note saying:   -50 Cent everyday? 'In Da Club' ten times in a row? 'Wanksta' in the morning, on repeat?  Both tracks suck, you need to check some next shit.  50's hurting, you're hurting, eat a dick-

       urlLink    The countdown has begun, I will be back to the center of Canada in seven days.  I'm looking forward to it immensely.  It's not only going to be nice to see my friends and family, but also to be away from the boredom I've become used to here.  I've got a few good friends here and granted, I'll miss them, but it's not the same as the people I've got back in Toronto.    It's also the little things:  Getting a haircut from Tito at Aristotelis. The big baby breakfast at Mel's. The Brass Rail. Pad Thai at the Green Room. Play De Record. Rotate This. Albert's Real Jamaican. Sizzler's late night chicken club sandwich. The Keg Mansion. The Go Train. The Streetcar. Zelda's. The Black Bull patio. Tortilla Flats for $2.75 beers on Wednesdays. Half-price wings at The Wheat Sheaf Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Hanging out in expensive restaurants because Klaus works there. Getting kicked out of Hemmingway's with Klaus after that. Playfighting on the street in Yorkville right after that. Biking along the harborfront. Huge parties at the Guvernment/Kool Haus. System Soundbar. Element. The Reservoir Lounge. My cat. Guest list spots. Missions. Breakfast at Only in Paradise with Diamond. The relative silence of Oakville. Queen Street. The Beaches. Parkdale. The frat house. The roof of Dennise's building. The LCBO and the Beer Store. 5ive. Boozecans. The Danforth. Speakers Corner. Jobs. Staying up all night and all day and getting wasted and laughing. Better drugs from more reliable people. Not being able to buy booze everywhere. Tall cans of Stella and Heineken for $2.20 or so...  What the fuck Quebec?  They're $4.00 here?  I'm running out of thoughts right now, but very soon I'll be thrust right back in the middle it all.  Much love to Montreal and I'll come back one day when the circumstances are right.  For now, T Dot represent.  Cheers, To the Devil.

       urlLink    I don't understand why people feel they have to drive around honking their car horns whenever some sports team wins a game.  I find it incredibly irritating.  I guess there was a soccer game today and I guess Portugal won.  I have no real problem with the Portuguese as a people, but when they are soccer fans who drive cars they are complete dickheads.  I live in close proximity to the Portuguese neighborhood of Montreal so I've been bombarded by obnoxious enthusiasm all afternoon.  It's hot in my apartment so I must keep my windows open for air circulation, unfortunately this means that I hear every car horn very clearly.  I even heard a fucking air-horn just now.  Do these people have no respect for the extremely hungover?  I am not feeling well today.  In addition to doing some dirty drugs, I drank far too much beer last night.  I haven't been able to function properly today.  It's hard to eat and I have no interest in much beyond my couch, tv and computer.  I get what I deserve.  I think I may have worked out a suitable solution to my apartment troubles.  I hadn't really thought of this until my pops said it today.  A new company has taken over the building, I received the letter.  I will inform them that I had an agreement with the previous administration that I was going to leave at the end of this month.  I will let the new administration know that I still consider this to be the way things are and I'm leaving.  If they really want to make an issue out of it, they can track me down and sue me for the remaining three months on the lease.  I doubt they will and even if they do it's really not that much cash.  Fuck them, they've dicked me around enough.  Fuck this apartment. Fuck hangovers. Fuck Portuguese soccer fans.

      I got home around three last night and checked my email.  I almost died laughing when I did.  I got an email from a friend of mine who was obviously completely fucking obliterated.  They probably couldn't see the screen without one eye closed, and even then I bet it was a challenge.  I appreciate the fact that this person tried to send me this, it shows that they really cared, because it must have been really hard.  I wish I could understand what is written here but I don't have enough money to buy enough booze to get wasted enough to understand the alcoholic alphabet used in this message.  I'll do my best to get fucked up tonight and read it again.    Here is the most drunken email ever sent:  YOu fukcnoing cock knowckerr.

Much thanks and appreciation go to 'M*&%$' for providing a shining example of why we should stay away from our computers when our blood-alcohol level is actually an alcohol-blood level.  Keep pounding the sauce.  After all, it is Saturday.

      My friend JK is here, she got in last night, there was a staff party at the club I work for so she met me there.  As soon as she got into the city she was at a club, having sushi for dinner and drinking from an open bar.  I think that was a good way to welcome her.  We went out after that.  Drum & Bass, some Bolivian marching powder and free drinks.  I can have fun no matter where I am, as long as there's booze involved, and when it's free booze I'm set.  I worked yesterday.  I haven't really worked in months.  I helped sell jewellery at the tattoo shop where my friend works.  I really just sat around for eight hours talking to girls and playing with a wiener dog.  I was supposed to be working again right now but the guy who owns the shop decided that I was unnecessary.  I'm not sure if I didn't sell enough or maybe the business wasn't good enough to pay an extra person for sitting around.  Either way the situation is irritating, I really could have used the money.  I still have not resolved the problem with my apartment.  I'm trying to break my lease at the end of the month, I don't think it's going to happen.  These cocksuckers have been jerking me around non-stop.  When I signed the lease, the landlord told me that if I wanted to break it I would just have to give one month's notice.  That landlord quit working for the company and I was not informed.  When I found out who the new landlord was and managed to talk to her, it was June first.  I told her that I wanted out of the lease, she said that I could pay this month's rent in cash and she would give me a letter breaking the lease.  She said she wanted cash so that she could be sure that I didn't give her a bad cheque.  I had five hundred dollars cash, she apparently had the letter.  We had issues connecting with each other and before we had the chance to meet, she quit her fucking job with the company that owns the building.  I'm thinking that it's a good thing that we didn't meet, she could have been planning to fuck me over with a useless letter and pocket the cash.  Fucking sneaky little bitch.  I managed to meet the elusive owner of the building by chance last Thursday.  I explained the situation to him, he said that nobody should have told me that I can break my lease with one month's notice.  He said that a letter would be dropped off the next day to all tenants with new contact info for the new building management company.  He told me to call him on Monday.  The Interpol-associated super was there during this conversation.  There was no letter on the day promised so I had no phone number come Monday.  I talked to the super and she refused to give me his number even though she was present when he told me to call him.  I wanted to smash her fucking skull in with a brick.  After I bitched for awhile she called him and let me leave a message, the voice mail system cut me off halfway through what I was saying.  I was livid.  I told the super to get in touch with him and tell him to call me.  A few days after that, the letter is finally delivered.  I call the company and ask for the person in charge of this building, get transferred to some woman I've never heard of, who is not even in her office at the time, and leave her a fucking message.  That was a couple days ago and I haven't heard anything back.  In fact, I haven't heard anything from anybody I've tried to talk to.  I'm pissed off.    These people are a bunch of cum-guzzling shitbags.  They can eat a huge bowl of dicks as far as I'm concerned.  I'm getting fucked over here and they're doing it by giving me the silent treatment.  I'd like some straight answers from someone who is in a position to actually do something, not some bullshit superintendent who works for the pigs.  I intend to be on the road back to Toronto in ten days.  I need a solution to this problem now.  These disorganized borderline slum lords deserve to be skull-fucked.  I've even tried another approach, I've tried bribing the super.  When people come to look for apartments to rent, she shows them.  I've offered her cash if she rents out mine before an empty one.  She didn't say no, and when I mentioned it in the hallway the other day she told me to be quiet, she didn't want anybody to hear because it's illegal.  She wouldn't act this way if she wasn't open to the idea, she wants discretion.  I'm not sure how wise it is to bribe someone who works for Interpol, but fuck it, it's done now.  She still hasn't done anything about it though and time is a factor.  I'm irate.  I can't wait to get back to Toronto.  I've had just about enough of this place.  The move was worth it in many ways, but I'm fed up.  I've really mastered the art of escapism in the past few months.  Usually I use alcohol, but I think I'll go grab some PCP tonight.    After all, it is Friday.

       urlLink    I originally wrote this post talking about the various places I went to and what I did this weekend. I also had a drug-related picture instead of this one. Looking over it now I realize that the entry was fairly dull, so it has been deleted. The picture was inappropriate as well so it has been replaced with this one. This picture has no relevance to the topic at hand, I just like it and I was looking for a way to incorporate it into this website. Regarding the weekend, I can safely say that I didn't eat enough but I drank plenty. I didn't sleep enough but I did do a fair amount of illicit narcotics. I went to several places with many different people but I didn't really have that much fun. I think that what I saw today was much more significant than what I did over the past few days.   I was on my way downstairs to see the super of my building this afternoon. I turned down the hallway to her place and I saw that she was busy speaking with two men. She asked me to give her a minute. I noticed right away that their choice of attire was somewhat odd considering that they were not wearing blue uniforms.   They were both wearing bulletproof vests.  One was wearing a loose fitting jacket of some sort over his, the other was not. I went up a flight of stairs to the entrance of the building and waited for her to finish her business. The two men left shortly thereafter, they did not look at me as they passed. I had the conversation with the super that I needed to have and I asked her what was up with the two guys in the bulletproof vests. I immediately remember thinking that I shouldn't have brought it up. She told me that she worked with them, this triggered a memory from last weekend.  I left a party last Saturday night and came home. I think I was drinking a beer in the stairwell and talking on the phone when my superintendent came up and waved for me to come with her. I got off the phone and went to her place, she was there with her 'cousin' from New York. She rolled a joint, I grabbed some beers from my place and I hung out with them for a bit. At this point in the evening I was completely fucked. I had just ingested a good dose of PCP, I hadn't slept the night before and I had been up drinking and doing drugs all day. I didn't say I was on PCP, I said I was on E, which to me didn't seem like a big deal at all considering I was blazing with them. PCP tends to arouse feelings of dread in most people, myself included. It also makes simple tasks such as conversation very confusing, which is why I wasn't even sure if she had said what I thought she said. Today's chance encounter reminded me and confirmed it at the same time.  She works for Interpol. This is an excerpt from their website.  "Interpol is the largest international police organization in the world. It was set up in 1923 to facilitate cross-border criminal police cooperation and today has 181 member countries spread over five continents. It supports and assists all organizations, authorities and services whose mission is to prevent or combat international crime."  I find this entire situation unsettling. What is the reason for an Interpol agent, or whatever she is, to be in my building? Why is she working as the superintendent for a cheap building when she works for the world's largest international police force? She doesn't speak English, only Spanish and French as far as I know, and her apartment has next to nothing in it, as though she hasn't taken the time to settle in. I'm wondering who or what she's looking for or who she's watching. I'm wondering how dangerous my neighbors might be. I know there's some shady people living here but I'm curious what they'd have to be doing to attract the attention of Interpol.  Strange things are definitely going on.  I think it's best for me to mind my own business.   One last thing, I find it very amusing that spellcheck suggests that 'PCP' be replaced with the word 'Pacify'.

       urlLink    I've seen a lot of strange things in the past twenty four years.  I've seen a very muscular, very large, very black drag queen with dreadlocks and tits taking a shit up against a fence in broad daylight.  I'm not saying that this is weirder than a body building rasta tranny blowing mud in the sun, but it's still odd.   This picture is me.  It looks a lot like me.  My friend asked me how I made it, as if I'd somehow doctored a photo of myself.  Even my brother could see that it looks like me.  It's actually just a random picture I took, I've been obsessed with taking shots of graffiti around Montreal ever since I got this digital camera.  I didn't even notice the resemblance until I got home and transferred the file onto my computer.  It's uncanny.   Somebody obviously spraypainted this with a stencil.  It's not very big, probably no more than six by eight inches.  It's located on Prince Arthur street, just around the corner on a wall beside a bar called Vol de Nuit.  It's just up the street from an upscale strip club called Kamasutra.  Vol de Nuit has two for one drinks at all times and Kamasutra is a nice club.  It's almost as if whoever painted it knew where I'd like to be immortalized, right between cheap drinks and hot girls.  How appropriate.

       urlLink    Today I saw an old homeless man eating a pear.  He was leaning over the top of a garbage can.  He was wearing plastic bags for shoes and he was on crutches.  I took a picture of his feet.  I was going to write more about how fortunate myself and my friends are and how little we actually have to bitch about.  I came to the conclusion that if I haven't made this point clear yet, I never will.  Instead I decided that this truck is much more interesting.  This is an excellent solution for business owners who do not want their property tagged by graffiti artists.  I have seen many buildings that have been decorated with pieces by graf artists.  These pieces actually have something to do with the businesses and often incorporate the company name into the artwork.  When you run your shop in an area that is completely covered by graffiti, why not just accept the inevitable and get your building bombed by a skilled artist?  The rule among graffiti artists is that you don't tag over someone else's art.  So if you're business is covered in a manner that is aesthetically pleasing and acceptable to other artists, chances are you won't be 'vandalized'.  The truck in the picture takes it to the next level.  Cube vans like this get tagged up all the time, I know I've seen it everywhere.  There are a few in Chinatown in Toronto that are so covered that you know the owners have given up re-painting them and just accepted it.  I believe this truck is from a store that sells slightly exotic meats.  I think they're called Fernando's and they deal in venison, ostrich, rabbit and others.  The artwork on this truck is not only well done, it's also pretty fucking cool.  No other graffiti artists are going to tag this because one of their own has already put effort into it.  Note the crazy rabbit on the passenger side door, that's some sick shit.  It's pleasing to see when more underground forms of artistic expression are accepted by those who would normally scorn them.  Especially if they have been forced into accepting them due to the fact that they have to deal with them whether they like it or not.  It shows how resilient people and art can be.  So to all business owners who have blank walls on their buildings and are tired of painting over tags...Get a skilled graffiti artist to do a mural for you.  A blank wall is virtually irresistible to someone with a spraycan, so do something about it, and pay the artist well.

       urlLink    I've come to the conclusion that myself and a lot of others need to stop acting like a bunch of self-absorbed little bitches.  I'm constantly whining over the fact that I'm stuck in a cycle of abuse.  I'm constantly thinking that I'm fucked up, that I've got issues.  I have friends who do the same.  I know that all our hardships are relative, but I know that we aren't doing that badly when I see people like this.    He's a crackhead who hangs out at the corner of St. Catherine and St. Laurent in Montreal.  Every time I pass this corner he's there, talking to himself, or to the air, or to pedestrians unfortunate enough to get close to him.  They are always suspicious and try to move away as quickly as possible.  I know this because I am one of these pedestrians.  The other day I walked by and he was trying to call me over to talk to him, as if we actually had something to discuss.  I declined his invitation and politely told him to fuck off.  I have seen him staring at the ground, looking for crack, picking up random objects that I'm sure he hopes are rocks.  He's probably a lost cause, although I hope for his sake that he's not.  Maybe one day he can turn his pathetic life around.  When I see people like this, it makes me wonder what right I have to complain when things don't go right for me.  All my issues are insignificant compared to this man's problems.  I've got friends and family and help if I need it.   I'm not a ghost.    All of us who constantly complain over how fucked up we are and how hard our lives are should really take a look at someone like this.  Regardless of what's happening in our lives, it could be worse.  On the off chance that I've made a mistake and this guy is not actually a crackhead, I apologize.  There's a chance that he has psychological problems.  He could be a paranoid schizophrenic.  Either way, it still puts things in perspective.  Things could be much, much worse.

      It's Tuesday afternoon and I believe that my brain has finally recovered enough that I can put my thoughts into words.  Yesterday was spent on the couch in the fetal position wondering why I put myself through such hell.  I've decided that it's a pattern that is not going to be easy to break, and I'm not sure if I'll ever break it.  This might be because I'm unable or it might be because I don't want to, but forget that.  I have things to say other than shit I've already said before.  Mutek was cool.  The arrival of my good friend on Friday evening was the beginning of disaster.  She's the best, but when we're together it usually means that trouble is imminent.  We began by drinking some wine and eating some cheese and sausage and almonds.  We then made it down to the Plastikman event and met up with everyone else.    Plastikman was good, but I think I have to agree with what my brother told me awhile ago.  He said that Plastikman was about a certain period in time, not only for us, but for the scene, the drugs of choice, and even perhaps for Richie Hawtin himself.  It's not quite the same anymore, which is evidenced pretty strongly by the last few albums.  Consumed is still a fantastic album and it really showed a departure from the older stuff like Sheet One and Musik.  The release of Artifakts B.C (meaning Before Consumed) almost seemed to me to be a half-hearted effort.  It definitely seemed less polished and less complete than Sheet One and Musik, the first two albums in the series.  Closer, the latest album, while interesting, never really captured my attention like the others.  I'd really love to hear something more along the lines of Concept:96 again.  What I'm saying here is not meant to insult Richie Hawtin's work, I'm just thinking that maybe what's being done now isn't the same because I'm not the same, or because something else isn't the same, or because nothing's the same anymore.  I also got to meet up with a girl I met on Soulseek who's from Winnipeg, Suzanne, aka Audio Angel.  She partied with us for a bit, she's cool.  Good taste in music, good DJ.  If anybody's ever in Winnipeg I suggest you check the club listings and find out where she's spinning.   After that the evening got a little blurry,  I was fairly intoxicated.  On the way to see Magda at Circus my friend realized that he had lost something so we had to go on a mission to try to recover said items.  They were not found.  The loss was accepted and we moved on to the next available substance and the next party.  Though my time at Circus is not really crytal clear in my memory, I know I had a good time.  The rest of Saturday was spent staying up, running around, getting high, getting drunk, and being stupid.  I know I was fairly rude to a friend of mine but you can only take someone grating on your nerves for so long before you fucking lose it.  I probably should have been a little more delicate, but I was not exactly in a delicate mood.    Good times.  Later that day, my dear friend decided that she wanted to take me out for a nice dinner.  So we went to a nice restaurant, I had steak, she had oysters (mussels?), we shared a bottle of red wine and she kept ordering tequila shots.  I must say that I had never gone out for an expensive dinner after doing lines of pcp.  Now I have.  After that the evening turns into another blur.  We went to the next party at Metropolis and my friends graciously paid for my ticket due to my extreme state of poverty.  I then got overly confused (probably due to pcp) and left.  I thought that I had left something at home that I had acquired for a friend, I was right about that.  I also thought that I had lost my wallet, I was wrong about that.  I accidentally called my friend's dad's cell phone at five in the morning rather than calling hers, he was obviously distressed.  I don't recall doing this at all, I pray I didn't say anything stupid.  I also almost got robbed by some big black buy on my way home.  He grabbed me, pushed me up against a wall and asked me if I had any drugs on me, he actually checked a few of my pockets.  I had no drugs on me at the time, and that's obviously all that he wanted because he decided not to take my Minidisc player.  There was really nothing I could do about this situation, he was twice my size and with people, I was alone.  I'm just happy that he didn't take my MD.  It sucked but I didn't lose anything and I didn't get hurt.  I made it home and somehow met the Spanish lady who is the super of my building.  She invited me to her place and smoked a joint with me and her cousin.  I was completely obliterated at this point, I'm sure she thinks I'm completely crazy, which doesn't really bother me.  I then came home and passed out, apparently with one eye open.  I'm waiting for the pictures.  After a much needed rest, I awoke feeling like a bag of shit.  My friend and I decided that it would be wise to go to the Picnik Elektronic.  I managed to eat something and we hit the liquor store.  After grabbing a twenty sixer of white tequila and twelve beers we hopped on the Metro and off we went.  I was happy that we got there when we did.  Herbert was DJing and I had missed him the night before due my temporary case of pcp induced Down Syndrome.   He was playing some funky, strange, slow shit which was perfect at four in the afternoon.  We began consuming beers and hitting that bottle of tequila.  When the next DJ was on, I wanted to know who it was so I asked a guy who had a performer's pass around his neck.  He informed me that it was a new guy on Minus records and that Jeff Samuel was playing next.  I told him that I thought that was great because I like Jeff Samuel's stuff.  He said 'thanks, that's me, I'm Jeff Samuel.'  I found this to be quite amusing considering what had happened to me a few months before while using Soulseek.  A girl noticed that I had a few tracks by Mr. Samuel in my files and she messaged me.  She told me that she knew him and occasionally snuck into his room and stole music.   She sent me a DJ mix by him.  I chatted with her briefly and mentionned Mutek and told I live in Montreal, she inquired as to whether I knew of a place they could stay when they came down.  I apologized because I live in a shoebox and I had just arrived in Montreal.  I told Jeff Samuel this story, it turned out that this girl is his girlfriend and I ended up drinking tequila with her.  After that I dipped into more of that pcp and all goes blurry again.  I was informed that my friend had to almost carry me home and that every time we hit a red light I tried to lay down and sleep but she wouldn't let me.  She said that I looked like a heroin addict.  I'm mildly embarrassed by all of this.  I just know that when I went to Piknic I had four bags of the stuff, when I got home I had two bags that were about a quarter full each.  Dangerous behaviour.  I'm lucky to have made it home in one piece.  I thank my good friend for babysitting.  I slept all night, I woke up to see her off.  I then layed around all day long feeling like absolute shit.  I ate, I drifted in and out of sleep, I felt guilty for going too far this weekend.  I couldn't even look at my computer screen and try to write anything yesterday.  I survived though.  I made it.  This morning was fucking great.  I knew that there was a package on the way to me from my brother, he has been referring to it as the 'package of ultimate goodness'.  Naturally, I've been curious.  I was awoken by UPS this morning around ten o'clock.  I was nowhere near prepared for what was in it.  First, seven different books, mostly reference and help for writers or people who want to be writers.  Which is good because I wouldn't mind doing just that.  He also included a book called Grand Central Winter, written by an ex-crackhead who lived in the tunnels under Grand Central Station in New York.  It looks fascinating and the forward is by Kurt Vonnegut, so you know there's something special to it.  I can't wait to devour this book.  Now that all sounds like it's cool enough to be a 'package of ultimate goodness' in itself, but there's more.  He also sent me a SICK digital camera.  A Nikon Coolpix 3200 with an extra memory card.  It takes excellent quality pictures and even video with sound.  It also has many other features which I have yet to figure out.  I know that I will have a shitload of fun with this new toy.  My brother is definitely the man, I can't think of a nicer thing that someone could have done.  It's not even my birthday.    So that's about it, I've had a crazy few days.  I've learned that I like to party like a prostitute.  I've learned that pcp is not always a good idea. I've learned that my brother is the man.    I think I pretty much knew all that stuff already.  Respect and thanks go to Dennise, Ryan, Jacqueline, Chris, Plonka, Will, Sven, Suzanne and Geoff.

      It's days like this that make me want to stay in Montreal for longer.    Twenty degrees, sunny, nice breeze and tons of gorgeous girls walking around looking like summer.  I walked by Metropolis and it looks like the preparations for the Plastikman show are under way.  It's nice to see trucks parked out front with Michigan plates, you know that people from Detroit are here.    I did a little promo work for Circus, they have finally impressed me again, the first time I went there I was pleased.  Akufen played a sick DJ set.  Now they've booked Magda for tonight, which is a good idea considering that she tours with Richie.  It will be a good night, Andrew Weatherall opening, Plastikman live and then over to Circus for Magda.  Two carloads of friends are on their way here from Toronto as I write this, and I've got free passes for all of them.  Now the trick is not to get fucked up until after the Plastikman show, I'd like to remember it.  I don't know how many times I've gone to a party with the intention of hearing one specific DJ but I get too retarded and it becomes a blur of a night.  I usually remember if it was 'good' but I couldn't tell you specifics.  I want to take all of this in.  He hasn't performed live in over nine years and I was there the last time he did.  It was a Transcendance party in Toronto in September of 1995.  I was sixteen, on three hits of acid and eating black beauties all night.  That's back when speed didn't necessarily mean crystal meth.  It was my introduction to Plastikman and I remember it being an incredibly intense night.  LSD is the ideal companion for his music.  I'm looking forward to this quite a bit, I don't want anyone to talk to me while he's on.  No distractions.  I'm sure I'll post some type of review tomorrow if I'm not too struggling.  To all those who can't be there, I feel for you.

       urlLink    I just let my pal stick a needle through my cartilage in my left ear.  Twice.  It hurt, but not as much as I expected.  After the first one I got a crazy adrenaline rush.  I felt hot, shaky and nauseous.  I had to lay down.  The second one hurt much more and started bleeding, which was interesting.  I was still laying down and I could hear my blood dripping on the bed-thing.  I still feel a little strange and it's been at least an hour since she did it.  I now understand what people mean when they say they get a sort of 'high' from piercing pain.  It's not the best feeling compared to some drugs, but it's interesting.  It felt like I had done a really strong pill and the first rush of it was way too much.  I feel better now.  It's burning.  I really have to watch how I answer the phone.  I didn't think when I picked up my cell a minute ago, it hurt like a motherfucker when I put it to my ear.  The person on the other end didn't understand why I was swearing so much.

      It's thursday afternoon.  After hanging out with a few speedfreak strippers last night I arrived home to a pleasant surprise.  I had allowed my friend to use my place to have a few glasses of wine with his girlfriend before they went to the first night of Mutek.  When I got in I found that they had left me four perfect lines of Montreal mescaline, or for those not in denial, PCP.  Naturally I did them.  As I was coping with the feeling of angel dust flying through my nasal passages, the phone rang.  It was my friend who had left me the rails.  He informed me that he had met one of the performers at the event and there was a ticket waiting for me at the door.  I grabbed my shoes and my minidisc player and I walked down to the show.  The sound of a recent Richie Hawtin mix helped to put me in the proper mood.  I got in with no problems.  The SAT is a cool venue.  After a beer I was pulled downstairs to the cavernous basement with the unisex bathroom.  There is a strange little construct down there which is not unlike an old arcade racing game.  Just big enough for two people, it was obviously designed to project a film on the space where the screen would be.  There was even two perfect little shelves ideal for beers.  More rails were stretched out, by this time I was beginning to realize that I was in for a twisted evening.  We returned upstairs.  Schneider TM was pretty good.  Four piece electronic group with a vocalist.  The only song I'm really familiar with is The Light 3000, which is a cover of the Smiths.  The rest of their material was alright, though I was pretty retarded by the end of it.  The guys who were on after them were shit.  Smith & Hack, nothing special at all, just two guys fucking around way too much with some bullshit thumping techno/house type shit.  No flow, no direction, no groove.  Just constant irritating tweaking.  Some of the crowd was into but most people were standing around looking puzzled.  This can be a common occurrence at a techno event, otherwise known as a 'chin scratching sausage factory'.  I walked home, I barely remember it.  I know that I made popcorn and tried to talk to some friends on MSN messenger, but I had to close one eye in order to see straight...so I gave up and crashed.  I should attempt to get some real sleep tonight.  Plastikman live tomorrow, Magda spinning at Circus and six friends from Toronto coming down.  Tomorrow might be the only night that could make me reconsider my decision to leave Montreal, but fuck that, I'm outta here.  Salut, Au Diable

      Have you ever taken a big chance?  Did you think it would be fine?  Did you think that everything would be easy and better and cooler?  Did people question what the fuck you were thinking?  Did you say 'I'll be fine, I'm (insert your name) for fuck's sake'?  Did those people tell you that you'll regret it?  That you'll be back?  All of this is quite familiar to me.  I decided to drop everything I know, everyone I know, a job I loved, a wicked girl, hookups galore and just take the fuck off.  People keep telling me that they respect the fact that I actually did it.  Many people have said that they would never have the balls to do what I did.  It seems now like it's time to admit that this place just isn't for me.  At least not right now.  Montreal is a cool city and I take back some of the mean things I said in the last post.  I just don't think that it's right for me at this particular point in time.  I have spent a lot of money on this venture, over five thousand dollars in three months.  On the surface that's a ridiculous amount of cash just to go back a few months later.  When I look deeper and think about what I've gained out of this experience it all seems worth it.  I've come to some serious conclusions about what I want to do in the future and all I have to do now is get this loosely formed plan clarified and put into action.  I've also realized what I had in Toronto, and that is a series of interlocking circles of friends that I'll never find anywhere else.  As my father recently said to me:  'The grass is not necessarily greener on the other side.'  Salut, Au Toronto.  By the way...the album of the day is Felix Da Housecat - Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever

      Other than sleeping until the mid afternoon I had a reasonably productive day.    I called landscaping companies looking for a job because apparently someone who is bilingual with almost a year and a half of bartending experience can't get a job in this shithole of a city.  I've really lost faith in Montreal, it's overrated.  I personally have changed my opinion on the whole Quebec separation issue.  Let the cocksuckers go, I say good riddance to bad rubbish.  Fuck 'em all.  Eat a bowl of dick Montreal.  Even the landscapers were not hiring, at least nobody I spoke to.  I'm getting more and more frustrated by the minute.  I think I need a little more Toronto in my life.  I don't even feel like getting drunk anymore.  I know that there's something wrong with me when I have beer in the fridge and I don't want to drink it.  Last night I only drank one beer.  Today, only three or four, but that was when I was helping a friend move and I didn't really enjoy them that much, I forced them down out of politeness and a sense of obligation.  Three guys carrying a bunch of heavy shit seems to be a time when beer must be consumed.  It's an unwritten rule.  The move was smooth until my friend got a phone call from his 'girlfriend'.  She was upset that he was still out helping one of his best friends move.  The move took longer than expected as it always does.  The exit we needed was closed and when we finally found the other way to the bridge it was gridlock all the way across.  This was due to the fact that the famed city of Montreal had two lanes out of three closed for non-existent construction.  In addition, this girl was being completely irrational and ridiculous.  The fact that she kept him on the phone for fifteen to twenty minutes crying and bitching while he was in the truck with two of his friends was pretty crazy too.  She just couldn't seem to handle the fact that he was spending time with anybody else, even if it was to help his good friend move.  It's unfortunate to see a good friend of mine caught in such a bullshit situation.  There's got to be something really incredible about this girl that he sees that I don't.  I understand that he may love her and that love isn't always rational, but I hate to see him suffer.  It's unnecessary.  Strangely enough, while writing that last paragraph I got a call from another friend in this fine city.  His girlfriend just took off.  I guess they got in a fight and her method of dealing with it is the opposite of freaking out, she leaves.  I don't really know if that's better but then again I don't really know these two that well.  I just know that my friend is upset because he's going away for a few days and won't be able to resolve his situation before he leaves.  It's highly unfortunate I suppose, but after listening to all the bullshit earlier in the evening, I barely had the energy to talk to this guy let alone make him feel any better.    So what about me?  I keep missing certain girls who have been in my life in the past but days like this make me wonder.  Maybe I only remember the good stuff, but I don't recall anything as bad as this shit.  None of the girls I've been involved with recently were this fucked up.  At least not that I care to admit...  3:43 AM update.  Another one of my friends has contacted me for emotional support regarding a fucked up relationship.  I won't even go into any details on this one but it's been going on far too long.  Someone should have put a stop to this fucking fiasco the minute it started.  I think I may have attempted to, but messing with other people's relationships is bad business.  Oh well.    Life goes on.  Love does not.

      I haven't been this busy in my entire life, it seems as though I'm always doing something but never really getting anything done.&nbsp; I have so much bullshit on my plate right now and&nbsp;everytime I think I may have accomplished&nbsp;something, there's five more things to do and&nbsp;a nagging&nbsp;feeling that I never really got the first&nbsp;one done.&nbsp; I'm hoping that life isn't like this forever, but I anticipate a future full of 'shit to do'.&nbsp; Gone are the days&nbsp;when my only responsibilities were smoking&nbsp;weed, drinking beer&nbsp;and fucking around.  I am intending to move today, it's roughly quarter to two in the the afternoon and it's pissing rain.&nbsp; I don't want to move in the rain but I do want to move today. &nbsp;I have two friends who have offered their assistance, one is a very nice&nbsp;girl who will drive me to the storage space where I&nbsp;will rent a&nbsp;van with money I can't afford to spend.&nbsp; Since I&nbsp;am a useless&nbsp;sack of shit with no driver's license, I need someone to come with me and drive it.&nbsp; She can do that but she won't be able to help me lift anything because she got&nbsp;in a car accident a few weeks ago and fucked her back up. &nbsp;I don't even want her to help me, she should&nbsp;be chilling out&nbsp;eating percs instead of fucking around in the rain with me and my belongings.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have another friend who said that he would be happy to help, but&nbsp;I know that he got caught in a bit of a blizzard last night.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was the one who provided assistance in finding the proper weather conditions for him and there was definitely a&nbsp;few centimeters on the ground in the morning.&nbsp; I&nbsp;should have written him off when he text messaged me at five&nbsp;AM to let me know that he was still&nbsp;awake.&nbsp; Freakin' dust bunny.&nbsp; I just want to move, I want my own place with my own bed&nbsp;in my own room.&nbsp; I want to be twenty stories above&nbsp;this city where I can&nbsp;chill and watch and listen.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want peace and&nbsp;solitude and I'll have it.&nbsp; Soon.  In addition to my&nbsp;relocation&nbsp;trials, I have a bachelor party coming up&nbsp;this weekend which&nbsp;should be a good time.&nbsp; I've only ever been to a few of them before and I'm not sure how this&nbsp;one will measure up, but we're doing&nbsp;our best to make it happen.&nbsp; I know for sure that we'll at least be retarded.&nbsp; If it wasn't for the planning abilities of the others involved, we'd be fucked.&nbsp; I'd like to say that I have been useful with regards to this,&nbsp;but I really haven't, I'm too&nbsp;fucking stressed out and busy myself.&nbsp; At least I'm confident in my ability to act as pharmacist for the evening and provide knowledge of the strip clubs in this city.&nbsp; This is not due to&nbsp;excessive patronage,&nbsp;it is due&nbsp;to a former career in the titty shaking industry.&nbsp; I hope that all works out, my friend who is getting married deserves to have a good time.&nbsp;   Since I began writing this it&nbsp;stopped raining, the sun is shining, and my coked out friend has yet to return a call.&nbsp; I'm sure everything will work out, it almost always&nbsp;sort of does.  For example, yesterday was a good day.&nbsp; I paid my rent for this new place and I got my keys.&nbsp; I also talked to a girl that I'd been wanting to talk to since I got back, I left her a message a few weeks ago but she never called me back.&nbsp; I thought that she probably didn't want to talk to me, sometimes things work out like that.&nbsp; Then again, sometimes they don't, so I called her back, I figured one more try couldn't really hurt.&nbsp; She said that she 'wasn't sure' if she got my message, whatever that means, but that she had been thinking about me earlier in the day.&nbsp; We talked for a bit, she's doing well and she sounds happy so that's good. &nbsp;I'd like to hang out with&nbsp;her again, she's fun and smart.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm pleased that I haven't lost contact with her even though I've only seen her once in about four months.&nbsp; I also saw a decent movie, turned down some drugs, saw one of the funniest episodes of South Park that I've ever seen and slept like a baby.&nbsp; I'm in the process of trying out a new system, it's like detox but completely half assed.&nbsp; Instead of getting wasted and fucked up all the time, I'm limiting it to the weekends now.&nbsp; No booze or chemicals monday to friday in the late&nbsp;afternoon, but&nbsp;party like a prostitute&nbsp;after that.&nbsp; I did it last week and I'm doing it this week, we'll see how long it lasts.&nbsp; There's one problem, I&nbsp;seem to overcompensate for the sober days&nbsp;by getting extra retarded on the weekends, I'm still hurting from this past&nbsp;one.&nbsp; It's better than what I was doing though, I know that it would be stupid&nbsp;to go on at the&nbsp;pace I'd set for myself&nbsp;these past few months.  I'd&nbsp;die.  Oh, in addition to all of that, I've got a wedding to MC in less than two weeks which I haven't started planning for at all.&nbsp; I'm trying to go back to school this september part time and I haven't applied yet.&nbsp; I'm only working sporadically and I'm living on the poverty line.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mountain bike&nbsp;only has one pedal and I really need some new clothes and shoes.&nbsp; I've got pulled ligaments in my left foot, an Industrial piercing that just won't seem to heal, a bit of a cold and a really sore jaw (for reasons unknown)&nbsp;and I'm perpetually on the move with no place to go.  That's&nbsp;why it's hard not&nbsp;to get wasted all the time.  Escapism can be a beautiful thing.

      It felt&nbsp;dirty and I thought I'd feel&nbsp;guilty&nbsp;later on.&nbsp; I was at my friend's house, we had just smoked some marijuana (which I'm told can lead to&nbsp;acts of depravity) when something happened.&nbsp; I didn't mean for it to happen, but it did.&nbsp; I was petting the cat, let's call her Thumper, when she started to lick my hand.&nbsp; At first I was a little uncomfortable considering that my friend (who owns the cat) was there watching...but he didn't stop it.&nbsp; Pretty soon she was going buck wild, just licking away on my left index finger, she got right into it, licking here, licking there, purring with her eyes closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thumper had obviously done this before, she was a pro.   I must admit I enjoyed it.   As soon as I started moaning and encouraging her she took a good portion of my finger into her mouth and gently nibbled on it while continuing to try and lick it.&nbsp; I was surprised by her enthusiasm.&nbsp; Eventually when my moaning reached a feverish peak, she stopped and went to lay down on the carpet, she licked her paws and rubbed her ears, she closed her eyes and went to sleep.&nbsp; I wiped my finger on my shorts and looked at my friend, who passed me the pipe.&nbsp;   I felt drained but satisfied.   Someday I'll look back on this day with fondness, for my left index finger was pretty clean.&nbsp; Even the fingernail, which is rarely clean.   It was the day I got my first sandpaper blowjob.   We laughed.

      I saw the apartment and it's perfect for me and I'm taking it and it will be bomb even thought it's temporary.&nbsp; I can even move in sooner than I thought if I want to.   I went to a local university and found out everything I have to do in order to apply as a mature student for next year.&nbsp; I now know what I must do in order to increase my chances of acceptance.   I sent my camera to my brother to get fixed, I miss it.   I met with my friends who are getting married and discussed all my duties as MC as well as all other aspects of the wedding, which I knew nothing about.&nbsp; Now I know something about it.   I got stoned and watched the Butterfly&nbsp;Effect.&nbsp; I was ready to damn the film from the start because it's got&nbsp;Ashton Kutcher&nbsp;in it and I thought I couldn't possibly take him seriously, but I guess he was ok and the movie was interesting even thought there were problems here and there.&nbsp; Meh, it wasn't bad I guess.&nbsp; I'd say watch it, fuck it, why not?&nbsp; There was at least a few&nbsp;disturbing and violent scenes.  So there...productivity.

      It's amazing how much things can change in a few days.&nbsp; I think I feel like shit today because I had things to do that just aren't going to get done.&nbsp; Walking around and job hunting in a humid thunderstorm is unpleasant and therefore not an option to&nbsp;me.&nbsp; Picking up my bike where I left it last week is also not going to happen, for the same reason.&nbsp; I have to go and see an apartment (or rather a room in one) that I have somewhat agreed to sublet for next month, I say 'somewhat' because of the simple fact that I haven't seen it yet.&nbsp; It's downtown, it's cheap, it's close to everything, but it's only for one month, so it's very fucking temporary.&nbsp; Everything in my confusing life is temporary, except for addiction, and that just doesn't seem fair.&nbsp; If I do decide to take it (and I probably will no matter how ghetto it is) I will still have to leave my belongings in storage, what's the point of moving everything I own into a place for one month?&nbsp; I'll probably just get my bed and stereo.&nbsp; Needless to say I don't like this one bit, especially since I have no clue what's going to happen in&nbsp;the following months.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is no way to live.&nbsp; I need work, a place and then school...Who knows?&nbsp; After that might come a cool new girlfriend, maybe some peace and purpose, maybe some serenity.&nbsp; Maybe not, maybe I'll never be content, maybe that's just how life is for some people, constant fuck ups and chaos and bullshit and partying.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There's also a chance that I'm feeling this way due to my excesses over the past few days.&nbsp; I got completely&nbsp;wasted all this past weekend and the days leading up to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;A ridiculous amount of booze and a moderate amount of powder tend to leave me feeling a little depleted, even if I did sleep for close to twenty hours on Sunday. &nbsp; Bah...So it goes.

      Life&nbsp;isn't that bad.  &nbsp;  I saw my pops yesterday, and he's cool as hell.  I saw my little sister yesterday, and she's the shit.  I saw a bunch of&nbsp;old friends last night, and that's where it's at.  I'm at a friend's house now, sipping beers and vodka after swimming. I'm either partying with&nbsp;them tonight or going to see a good DJ.  I'm getting retarded.  I got some money, but not much.  I got some opportunities, but nothing concrete.  I got a compliment, and I liked it.  I could be in a worse place.  I could be in a worse mood.  I could be dying or dead.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nothing's wrong.

      As I wandered through this city, stumbling out of one hangover and&nbsp;looking forward to another, I felt a&nbsp;sense of sadness.&nbsp; I saw this place as a&nbsp;desolate tangle of concrete and poison.&nbsp; Every old person I passed reeked of death and loneliness.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every&nbsp;other person&nbsp;seemed doomed.&nbsp; I even saw children in a negative light, it was as though they were all just waiting&nbsp;for the inevitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Unfulfilled dreams, wasted lives, regrets, failures,&nbsp;lies, sickness,&nbsp;uncertainty, confusion and misery.  &nbsp;  I couldn't shake this oppressive negativity, I barely saw the point in trying anymore.&nbsp; I&nbsp;understood why the 'less fortunate' near the shelter at College and Spadina can live the way they do.&nbsp; It could be so easy for someone to&nbsp;lose&nbsp;themselves in a&nbsp;blur of drugs and alcohol and&nbsp;try to forget that there was ever any chance at being reasonably happy.&nbsp; The idea of a purpose in life seemed completely absurd to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Then I realized that I was being a fool.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It's all perception.&nbsp; That's the way things looked to me earlier today.&nbsp; That doesn't mean that that's the way things are.&nbsp; There are as many&nbsp;ways to&nbsp;perceive the world as there are people walking it's surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I was on the Go Train this afternoon, making the trip from Toronto to Oakville.&nbsp; I've made this short voyage hundreds of times.&nbsp; There's one point between Port Credit and Clarkson where someone has built a short bmx course, it's full of jumps and little hills.&nbsp; I saw a few kids with their bikes so I put down my book hoping to see some tricks.&nbsp; I thought I wasn't going to see anything because they were just standing there, but then I noticed something.&nbsp; The kid in the middle had dropped his pants and was proudly displaying his bare ass for everyone on the train.&nbsp; It was a full out mooning and it was great,&nbsp;but the&nbsp;fact that this kid had the ability to moon hundreds of people at once made it better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mooning one person is&nbsp;funny, mooning a whole train&nbsp;is gold.&nbsp; That made my day, fuck all those depressing thoughts I was having earlier, I need to&nbsp;catch myself when I'm feeling that way, tell myself to stop acting like such a&nbsp;pussy and go out and moon someone or something.  &nbsp;  That kid's got it all figured out, at least for now.

      I'm probably going to die much sooner than I'd like to. &nbsp; I could be dying right now, and I don't mean in the way&nbsp;people say that 'everyone's dying, just slowly'. &nbsp; I mean, I could really be dying, it's possible. &nbsp; Just a thought. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Toronto fucking rules and I roll with ill motherfuckers.    I hung out with a friend last night and got wasted.  I always knew that he did big things but I never knew the extent.  When you wear close to $100,000 worth of jewellery but don't have a job it's pretty obvious that you're doing some next shit.    He's a nice guy, fun to hang out with and pretty chill, but the stories I heard yesterday blew my mind.  Like how some guy was in his house talking shit to him, saying that he was a bitch and claiming that he was going to rob him.  All this in front of a girl who was a friend of both of them.  My friend went to his room, told the guy to come up, said that he didn't want to get hurt and that the guy could just take his shit.  When the guy came in his room, my boy tossed him a ziplock full of cash, pulled out his 'gat' and fired off five shots right beside his head.    The guy's deaf.  My friend then made the guy get on his knees, put a different gun in his mouth and made him cry until he threw up on it.  He then made him clean the gun in front of the girl and sent him on his way.  Needless to say the guy forgot that he ever wanted to rob my friend.  That's just one story I heard last night.    I love this place and everyone in it.  I finally got back behind the bar yesterday, I worked with some friends at a fine dining restaurant.  For some reason I feel right when I'm serving drinks, it just fits.  In Montreal I couldn't even get close to a bar, here I've already worked at one and I have an interview at another on Monday.  I've also been denied for a job already and that's ok, it shows that there are at least opportunities here.  I also popped by the strip club last night, saw some friends, saw some hot girls and got a phone number for a guy I know who owns a nightclub.  Maybe he'll need a bartender, we got along well before so it's worth a shot.    Life is good.  I just went for a walk with some friends.  We hit the liquor store and I got a sub.  I was being very obnoxious and rude and it was fucking great.  Talking shit can be so much fun sometimes and swearing in french is wonderful as well.  My friends were slightly embarrassed, this is a fairly nice neighborhood.  On the way back to the house I bit my lip really fucking hard, it's still bleeding a little bit and that shit happened about fifteen minutes ago.  How's that for karmic retribution?  I was being a dick and now I'm in pain.  Fuck.

      It's not good when I can't really think of anything good to say.  I could write about how I got completely fucked up on saturday night and I don't remember anything but I snapped into reality at a club that I never go to and I don't know why I was there.  I could write about how I felt like shit on sunday, went to see a few friends, ate and got stoned and then waited for a bus for too long.  I could write about how I went job hunting yesterday and walked for hours, sure it was productive but there wasn't much that looked promising.  I could write about how I am completely in limbo and I don't know what the fuck I'm doing but then I'd feel like a bitch.    Instead I think I should go for a ride and wait for my laundry to finish.  I think I should continue job hunting.  I think I should do some part time promo work for the club I used to work for.  I think I should go see some friends.  I think I should stay somewhere different tonight.  I hate being on the move constantly, but I have to do what is necessary.    I need a home.  This plan of staying with friends, subletting and then housesitting for the next four months is looking less and less attractive.   I need a fucking job.    The problem is that I never know what's going to happen and this world can be a tricky motherfucker, and things never seem easy.  I guess stability and I just weren't meant for each other.  Toronto's cool though.

      It's good to be back.  The move was a serious pain in the ass for all concerned and I'm happy it's over.  I'm pleased to say I won't have to deal with Uhaul's particular brand of expert fuckery for awhile.  Thanks go to my pops for making it happen and for not being in a terrible mood throughout the ordeal.  I've already seen a lot of people I wanted to see.  Had pints with a few of the boys the first night I got home.  Got a little retarded with my pal yesterday afternoon.  Went to visit another good friend and saw his new place.  Went to my old work to say hello and wound up staying all night.  Saw a lot of people who I'd been eager to see,  waitresses, doormen, bar guys, dancers.  Much love to Diamond, Haley, Victor, Fiona, Tracy, Ann Marie, Tony, Souci, Dave, Chris Calder, Gregor, Germano, Javier, Kris, Nick, Shane, Tammy and the list goes on...  I then stayed out late with the multifaceted one and heard some crazy stories.  It was really good to see him.  It was also good to see his best friend, and though I've only met her on a few separate occasions I know she's the shit.  I was blown away by how much of a good friend she is to him.  My friend is loved.  I would have said 'more than he knows' but he knows.  It was intense.  Now I'm going to go camping and see a bunch of people who I haven't seen in months.  I'll probably get fairly retarded, which sounds about right.  Viva Toronto.  Just a little update...the ride decided not to go so I'm not camping.  Not sure what to do now.  I'm sure I'll find something and I'm sure it will be more interesting than anything I would have been doing in Montreal.  That's because I'll probably be doing something with someone I haven't seen in awhile, and that's fucking great.

      When I was waiting to leave Montreal this morning, there was a brutal thunderstorm.  It was as though the city was saying fuck you one last time but in a very loud and dismal way.  When I thought it was over I stepped outside, it started again.  Harder.  When I got into Toronto this evening, there were fireworks everywhere.  It was probably because of Canada day but it was felt like it could have been for me.  Like the city was happy to have me back and it hadn't been the same since I'd left.  When I came home there was fireworks.

      I still haven't moved. I have an apartment that I've paid rent for but all I've got there is some clothes and a computer. The computer may be sitting dismantled in a pile on the floor but at least the clothes are clean. The apartment is empty, the previous roommates have vacated the premises. It's a fairly large three bedroom on the twentieth floor of a pretty ghetto building which looks out over the most densely populated area in all of Canada. The guy who's room I took assured me that he heard less gunshots this summer than last. The other girl who apparently still lives there is staying elsewhere and I'm alone with no bed. I still don't even know whether she's hot or not. This means that I have been couch surfing and staying wherever I can until I manage to move my stuff in.  The friend who was supposed to help me last week didn't call for two days, and when he did, it was only to ask me if I could grab him some more charlie. He did offer a half-assed explanation for why he stiffed me out, but it didn't explain the lack of a phone call. He has since re-offered his assistance for this week, and oh yeah, he wants me to go on another mission. I think if I decide to accept his aid, the mission can wait until after the move. That way there's less chance of someone getting lost in another blizzard and disappearing for two days. The nice girl who I mentioned in a previous post tried to help me move the next day. I say 'tried' because we had some miscommunication with the truck rental place and never got the job done. She went way out of her way for me and for that I thank her, it's just too bad that the past couple weeks have been filled with world class fuck-ups. One day soon I'll have a bed that I can go home to, I'm fed up with imposing and I'm sick of couches. In addition to all of this I was becoming disinterested with the weekday detox thing I was doing, but it was no longer an issue.  Friday had arrived.  One thing I learned this weekend. Doing a cap of morphine and drinking twelve beers can not be defined as 'taking it easy on a friday night'. Saturday afternoon I threw up several times in the bathroom of a restaurant in the gayborhood and then ate a huge breakfast. I had already ordered food before I started feeling sick so I had to eat it, it would have been a waste otherwise. Being exceptionally poor inspires thinking like this.  Saturday night was successful. The bachelor party came together nicely. We had a nice suite in a fine hotel, lots of beer and liquor, plenty of pills and weed, some good music and some good people. We got my friend retarded and made him wear a bright orange Muu Muu, a ridiculous hat and a ball gag, he was treated to a lap dance at a fine strip club, he was with friends. What more could you ask for? I admit that some of the negroes who were in town for Caribana weren't impressed with his outfit, but after we explained that he was getting married most of them stopped calling him a 'bahti boy'. I'm not sure how you would actually spell that, but based on my friend's roommate, and the confidence she displayed when she told me how she would spell it, I think that's probably about right. Regardless, it was a good night, shouts go out to Rod from North Carolina, keep working for the kids and remember that it's always a good idea to drink with retarded white guys by the pool.  Sunday night was difficult but the motivation was strong. Industry reunion (kind of) party at the Docks with Mark Farina, DJ Sneak, Doc Martin, Stacey Pullen, Josh Wink and some other good locals. I saw a lot of people I hadn't seen in months and saw some good people that I'd seen more recently but were still a pleasant surprise. I either chilled outside on the patio by the water or I was inside shaking it like a salt shaker. The music was fucking good. It's important for me, when I shake it, that I shake it in a manner befitting a salt shaker. It's also reasonable to shake it like a crying baby, though it may be frowned upon.  Upon leaving the party I was dropped off at a parking lot where my friends had parked their cars. It was at Shuter and Sherbourne, which is a sketchy area, especially early morning on a holiday monday. You wouldn't think that this would be a peak time for strange motherfuckers walking the streets, but it definitely is and if you really think about that, you'll probably agree that it should be. I've decided that I like passing a bottle of Jack around while drinking beers with my friends. I like it even more at seven in the morning at the corner of Shuter and Sherbourne while a group of sketchy people sit on the steps on the other side of the street. It definitely helps that they were drinking too, they were just like us and we were just like them. We are the kind of people who drink on street corners in the morning.  Since then, I've been sleeping and playing with a kitten and three puppies. The puppies are only seventeen days old, they can't walk yet and they look like little polar bears.  I wish I didn't have to wake up for a week.
