						   I've learned a lot from the article by Amy Klein. Here's the digest of it. You can prevent sicknesses by reducing your exposure to germs. Follow these tips for healthier, happier you: 1.Wash those hands! Studies show the best way to avoid sickness is frequent and proper hand washing. Always wash your hands before and after thouching "high-risk" items like doorknob and ATMs. Using lots of soap and water, scrub all surfaces of your hands for at leat 15-20 seconds. And be sure to dry your hand thoroughly after washing! Carry a packet of tissues with you to make sure this is possible. 2.Carry instant sanitizer for times when soap and water arem't available. 3.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your bare hands. Most germs enter the body through these places. 4.Don't shake hands with anyone who's sick. 5.Don't share cups, untensils or even towels. 6.Cover your nose and mouth every time you cough or sneeze-with a tissue, if possible! Also use a tissue to wipe your eyes. Pinkeye is surprisingly common and contagious! Trow tissues away in a closed container. Ask those around you to do the same. 7.Make sure your home germ-free. Dishcloths and kitchen sponges are germist surfaces in the home. But simply microwaving these items for two minutes kills the germs. Sinkdrains, faucet handle and doorknob are also notorious for spreading germs. Disinfect these surfaces often. 8.When possible, use public restrooms with no-touch facilities. When these aren't available, try this trick: After washing your hands, turn off the faucet with a paper towel or tissue. Then use it to open the door before throwing it away.

						     Leading fast-paced lives in concrete jungle makes people be under enormous pressure. Some gets increasingly unhappy, others hot-tempered and still others even insane. Going faraway from the Pandora's box for a trip would help to relieve you a great deal. And don't worry about how to narrow down your choices, the following tourist attraction I'm going to detail is quite a place to visit.   In Wangkung you can mightily enjoy the serene atmosphere along the beach and have some refreshing delicacies.   First,head over to the Delicious Food Street which bustles with pedestrians but is not uncomfortably crowded. Here, you may have oyster to get more energy, and thus, be prepared to explore the dynamic tourist attraction.   Next, go to the beach on which a lighthous stands nearby. Have some fun picking up crab walking by, making an obserbation about mangrove and admiring the beautiful sunset,which turns yellow to orange, to pink, to red and even to purple. For a brief retreat from these activities, have a traditional ice lolly to quench your thirst.   Eventually, participate in haggling with street vendors which always brings some unexpected fun. And don't forget to buy the famous peanuts stir-fried with sand as the snack on your way home.

						   Living in a bustling city,we have alternative but to face stress. It might originate from a large amount of work,low self-esteem,or even busy traffic. Since avoiding a problem will not resolve it,trying to figure out some ways to defeat it would be he better choice. When you're frustrated with your work,take a break and do something to cheer yourself up. You might sing a lovely song,have a cup of coffee or write down an account of what is bothering you. When you have no confidence,forget about it and think about what you can do. Try accentuating the positive. When you're whining about cars whistling by and traffic jams,stop,and whish the drivers a safe journey. In the long run,try to lead a relaxing life and ignore what is irritating you.

      I'm So Stupid written by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzai Track 3, Time: 4:08 ------------------------- 'Cause I used to live In a fuzzy dream And I wanted to be Like all the pretty people  I'm so stupid 'Cause I used to live In a fuzzy dream And I used to believe In the pretty pictures That were all around me But now I know for sure That I was stupid  Chorus:  Please don't try to tempt me It was just greed And it won't protect me Don't want my dreams Adding up to nothing I was just looking for Everybody's looking for something  I'm so stupid 'Cause I used to live In a tiny bubble And I wanted to be Like all the pretty people That were all around me But now I know for sure That I was stupid Stupider than stupid  Stupider than stupid Stupider than stupid  (chorus)  Everybody's looking for something Everybody's stupid, stupid Everybody's looking for something Everybody's stupid, stupid Everybody's looking for something Everybody's stupid, stupid Everybody's looking for something Everybody [everybody]  (chorus)   http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~kennyz/madonna_lyrics/american_life.html#imsostupid

      Day in, day out, I feel desperately regret not having treasure every second, minute or hour that has gone far away. I read a great deal while I am not sure if I've digested. Straggly mess in my heart and low self-esteem puncture my ego. I engage in every single confidence-losing activity, representative of wackey and nerdy cups of tea when alone. Enjoying "myself" is quotidian and thus am deluged with intoxication. It's clear I need sizable freedom and personal space. None the less, I am a typical maverick. Let it remain as it is. And I am still thundering across my path in my way.

      After I watched The Last Samurai, I got more interested in Japanese culture. I have got addicted to Japanese culture since my gradmother brought me into the contact with it, which was just something about daily life when Taiwan is colonized with Japan. And I searched for some information about it in World Book: Samurai were the members of hereditary worriors class in Japan. The early samurai defended the aristocrats' estates in the provinces. The samurai wore a protective helmet and armor. They use two curved swords, one long and one short. During the 1000's and 1100's, the samurai began to develop a tradition of values and personal conduct. They valued horsemanship, sill with the bow, strong self-discipline, and bravery. Above all, they prized total obedience and loyalty to their lords, and personal hornor. If the samurai were dishornored, they would consider it a duty to commit ritual suicide. The samurai began powerful after Yoritomo, the Minamoto clan leader, established the first  shogunate (worrior government) in the late 1100's. Their military strength and administrative organization provided a foundation for a long period of relative peace. In the 1300's to 1500's, under the weak Ashikaga shogunate, the samurai became the leaders of Japanese society but battled among themselves. The greatest of the worriors, called  daimyo , controled vast territories. After a period of control by local warlords, Japan was reunited in the late 1500's. In 1603, the powerful Tokugawa shogunate was established. The samurai then influenced every part of life until the mid-1800's, when the Japanese emperor regained full control.

      The words you use in talk and composition can reveal your laguage ability. Despite if it has significance, the accuracy is another factor to be observed.  One day, I told my friend, who is an American, that I picked up a new vocabulary word  chichi  having close meaning with affectation when I consulted a dictionary about the subtle differences between mystique and mystery. All of a sudden, doubts deluged him. He responded, "Chichi is a real word, but it's usually colloquial. It also sounds kind of gay (the sort of thing gay people would say) so you have to be careful how you use it. People usually use it ironically. If your essay is in formal English, you should probably avoid it. If you are writing more colloquially, it's okay." So, the next time you talk or write something, try to craft your words or it might cause enormous understanding or doubts.
