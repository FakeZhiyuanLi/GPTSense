      i thought i should just give you all a smile today:   the most embarrassing moment i have ever had was in 8th grade... ::flashback::  i was walking down the outside hallways of our school while chewing gum to relieve myself in the bathroom. and at that precise moment, i happened to see my all-time-crush at the end of the hallway walking toward me. i started freaking out and didnt know what to do (lil self-conscious me). i quickly devised a plan to get him to look at me and actually notice me...and that plan was to blow a big bubble with my gum and pop it all sexy-like. lol!  welp, the time came to blow that blubble, and he actually saw me starting to blow that sexy-bubble...i blew the perfect bubble and was about to pop it when the wind started to blow. my hair had suddenly gotten a mind of its own and blew into my sexy-bubble. i was a sticky mess with so much hair stuck in the bubble gum and my face that i could barley see anything. the only thing i could see was my all-time-crush's face bursting with laughter as he passed by me.   embarrassing, i know. but i seemed to get over this traumatizing experience just fine. lol! this is Shannon signing out.  -Shannon
