      Havent posted in a couple of days, not much has happened.  However, I am setting up my own web hosting company.  Gunna be a lot of fun, and hopefully make money.  Also I'll setup a reselling electronics store, where I sell a warehouses shit to people on my price.  People do it all the time and make money at it, so I figured why not, its cheap and may benefit me.  Just tired now, planning everything out, thats it. ttyl

      Once sunday morning came along I woke up bright and early at around 11a.m. (early for a non-working day for me).  The family got ready and we went down to North Haven for a birthday party of a cuzin's.  She turned 12, and had a little pool party.  We stuck around at their house drinkin soda and 'acting' like it was fun, but we pretty much just talked with some people that we knew, no swimming, thats what all the little kiddies did.  We left their house, say, around 5:30p.m. and went straight to Middle Cove, Essex, where we keep our boat.  The 36 foot 1976 (I think) Chris Craft, is a fun boat to have.  We've only had it for about a year though, so we're still getting used to it.  The family all suited up, got everything ready, slowly and 'goodly' made out way out the river.    On the way out we could just tell that the place was going to be packed.  We were on the way to the outside of the river, Saybrook Point, to watch the fireworks.  As we turned the corner coming out and started heading a little bit west, there were probably...100 or so boats already out there, all anchored waiting for the fireworks.  This was about 7:30pm and the fireworks were at 9:30, so we were quiet early.  We ate dinner, watched the fireworks, and had a great time.  I love fireworks, sat on the bow of the boat (the front) and enjoyed every bit of it.  We got back into Middle Cove around midnight, slowly, in the dark, radar going, flashlight spotting buoys, and carefully.  It was a good trip.  Once we got pulled into the slip, everybody shut things off, and went to bed.    Aparently; my little sister (3 yr. old) had a hissy fit in the middle of the night that probably woke up the whole marina, me however, 3 feet above her in the top bunk, slept through it, i dont remember a thing about it.  I'm a pretty deep ass sleeper.  But, I woke up, and ate a muffin or two, and sat around with the rest of the family.  Around 10:30 everyone packed up, and put the things back in the minivan on the shore.  11:00a.m came and everyone except for my dad and I left.  My dad and I went on the boat back to go down the river to Ferry Point Marina where him and I work.  I thought I'd be working from noon to 6pm today, but, when I got there it was so slow that Mike told me he just didnt need me (the dockmaster there) and that I could go home.  So, here I am, home, writing this, and about to eat a grilled cheese.  ;)

      Its time for a new computer, and its time to plan it down to each screw of it.  I have it laid out in my mind, I just need to type it all up.  I thought for a minute, why make this computer now all jazzy if I can just build a whole new one.... So, instead of buying all this = http://dryice273.net/xoxide.html , I'm just going to go with my plan, and buy what i can afford, when I can afford it, and built it as that happens.  http://dryice273.net/computer.html .  The parts and prices will definatly change between now and then, but thats the rough estimate of the starting figure out what the computer is going to come out to be.

      Well, got home from work a little while ago, pretty short day it seemed.  Got there around 8:15 a.m and left around 3:15 p.m.  I thought I'd stay there until 5 or 6, but, it was slow, and I took no lunch break.  I'm sitting here right now, didnt want to go to dinner with the rest of the family so I stayed home to play some counter-strike and talk on aim... the usual.  What I did mostly at work was either sit at the gasdock or work on 'my' boat.  Its not exactly mine, but we have a family boat, and another one.  Its a 1975 22 foot Mako Center Console.  Very nice boat, I love it.  Today we put the 150HP Yamaha on it, so its gunna haul ass!  I'm bettin it'll do 40!  But, we started ripping all the wiring apart so we can get the new wires guages and controls in for the new motor.  When I say we, I mean my dad and I.  I just cant wait until we get this thing in the water.  I'm going to have pictures posted of it on here very soon, I just need to bring the camera to work where the boat is for a day.  I'll get back to you on that.  But, good day, made some money like usual, happy I went to work.  But, on the bad side, someone came to visit me and I couldnt see through their windows to see if it was them.  :(.  I talked to them about it, its all cool.  I hope to meet up with them again shortly.  I'll post another post again later on tonight.

      I'm on my way to bed right now.  Today was a slow day finally, sat around, woke up at 1:15pm.  Not much happened.  A little summer hail storm happened and that was it today, so I'm going to bed.  Tomorrow I'll be waking up probably around 6-7 and going to work early with my dad.  Work probably to about 6ish, so there is another long day that I love.  Work really isnt bad, I love being there, and the best part is that I'm getting paid!  O well, I'll post again tomorrow.  Good night.
