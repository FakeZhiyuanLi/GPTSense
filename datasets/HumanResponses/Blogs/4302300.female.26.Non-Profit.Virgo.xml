      I have a wedding to go to tonight.  I am not quite looking forward to it because of how late it is taking place.  I am not feeling all that exhausted though which is good so I feel physically up to it, but I just know when I get home tonight I am going to be too tired to deal with waking up every 5 minuted to give Graham his pacifier. Before I go I want to make Dan dinner so that he has something to eat.  I have decided on spaghetti and meatballs.  After 6 years of being vegetarian I have decided to make a change.  I don't really like eating meat that I cook but I do like eating when we go out.  I'll probably be vegetarian again, I don't even like meat but it sure beats driving over an hour to go out to dinner. Now I can go anywhere and get something, I can actually hear the specials rather than not even opening the menu and knowing the only thing I can eat is a boca burger.  Yes, I know.  It's selfish for me to eat animals just so I can go out to eat.  Guess what?  I don't care.  I have spent most of my life being a people pleaser and I am tired of it, I am sick of being respectful, and I am tired of altering the way I am or feel so that I don't offend anyone.  So if I eat meat then so be it.  Let me endulge myself a little.  I have been living a very boring life lately.

      The illusion of it being chilly outside is really messing with me because of this damn air conditioner.  I always speak of wanting to just get more in touch with the outdoors but yet I can't manage to keep the air off.  Our bedroom feels like a cave, and the moisture in the air is really making me sick.   Of course I start my first post negative.  That's another thing I am trying to get in touch with, my positive side.  Both Dan and I are trying to see the beauty in situations rather than always dwelling on the ugly things.  I don't know when we became this way but it just doesn't matter anymore, what's important is that we change especially since having a baby last December.   We have this new baby, and he is really evolving into this little old man.  We wheel him around Target the other day, and he looks at all these things, and he waves his arms in the air, lowers his eyebrows, pulls his chin in as though he is surprised and confused about all these new things, but then he lets out this loud yell, waving his arms more aggressively.  He looks like an old man yelling to tell you not to walk on his grass. It's adorable, but who knows what he is really thinking.  Dan and i sit up late at night talking about how cute it is, and what could he possibly be thinking.  He never cries when he sees something new, a big dog, a little dog, a new person, the pool.  We took him to NYC last month just to walk around and to visit Dan's old friends, and as we walked down St. Mark's place, and it's worse than the mall on a Saturday the week before Christmas, and he was reaching out to grab people, yelling at them (probably yelling move out of my way), and he was in a good mood all day.  People kept talking to him, and he would start laughing at them, or he would talk back.  He is an explorer.   As far as our Dan and my relationship, that's starting to need some work as well.  It isn't bad at all, but it was getting really good before getting pregnant.  We were starting to laugh so much more.  I love laughing.  The baby set us back a little though he was planned, it still is a big adjustment.  We have to wait till the baby goes to bed to talk to one another, and we don't always agree on how to take care of him.  We are both so bull headed sometimes.  Anyway, we just need to laugh more.
