      The first week of school was alright (other than the fact i've accidently hurt myself 5 out of 7 days! ) Clumsy me! It's now Tuesday and i have geometry homework that I do not want to do. I'd rather sit here and draw, listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers. I'm kind of mad because I found out that I'm not in govenor honors this year for art because I'm not able to take 1st semester art class due to me failing 1st semester biology last year and I have to take it again. i hope that made sense. Being a small sophmore really sucks because then i feel like people think I'm a freshman and being in biology again doesn't help. I can't wait til I get this school year over with. I have a feeling it's just not going to be good. Homecoming is early this year! and i don't have a date yet. Usually I would have a boyfriend to go with, but at the moment I'm single. I have like 4 guys in mind too.... but I really doubt I'd be able to go with them. I want the guy to ask me too... and i don't want to go to homecoming alone. :sigh: I'm just going to pray about everything and see where God leads me. Here is an abstract picture i drew around spring time

       Hello!  This is my first post on blogspot and the first day of school. My language arts teacher told us about blogspot and how we all might make one. So I decided to go ahead and get use to it.  I never liked the first day of school because everything is messed up. I didn't even know what bus I was suppose to get on. This morning they told me something completly different than what I was told this afternoon. Most of my teachers are nice, which is a good thing of course.  I finally met my neighbor today! She's a junior and I've already met her brothers. They're all really nice. But now I dont have to ride the bus alone, so, it's all good!  I can't wait until FCA (fellowship of christian athletes) starts again. It's always an amazing experience and it's awesome because you're worshipping in school!  I will try to remember to post on this everyday. I will post some artwork once i find out how.
