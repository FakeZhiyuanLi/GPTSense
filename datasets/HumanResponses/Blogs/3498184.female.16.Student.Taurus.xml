      Saturday was my first day at work. It was a little overwhelming but I figured it out. There's a lot of stuff to remember to tell the people. You forget what you've already said. Here's how it goes.  "Hi! How are you? Good. Can I see your tickets please? Okay now passports or birth certificates. Alright, now credit card and credit card form. Are you both going to be using this exact credit card the whole time? Okay now can I have your immagration papers? I'm going to need you to sign right here. Great. I'm going to need to take your picture. Okay, now here are your key cards to get on and off the ship, into your room and they are also what you'll use to buy things from gift shop or if you wanted a massage. Your dinner reservations will be at blah blah if that's a problem you can talk to the matridee on the ship. This is your map, and this is a welcome note from Holland America that has basic information that you'll need to know! Have a great trip." And that's the basics, if they have kids it's more difficult and they always have questions, but it's not too hard once you get the hang of it. The hard part is standing up for so long on the concrete floors. My feet and back hurt, but hey. It's a good job and I'm glad I have it. I feel bad for Em though cuz I don't know everything so I'm always asking her questions.   On sunday it's a little easier becuz you don't have to take their picture. OMG! On the way to work on sunday, the exit we take was closed and we had no idea where to go, we were so lost! We spent about 45 minutes driving around seattle! We ran stop lights, illegal U-turned, stopped on the freeway to backed up, sped of course, and a bunch of other crap. I thought it was funny and when Emily said "Hey, that's where work is, and here's where we are I just cracked up. I was crying I was laughing so hard. She didn't think it was as funny, but i couldn't help it. Eventually we got to work. Did you know Seattle has a China town? I didn't until we drove through it.   I've got 5 days off, then another two days of work.  ~Bayz

      YEAH! I got a car finally! I love it. It's a 1988 Ford Bronco II XLT. It has a light tannish top, and a dark brown bottem. I named it "snack pack" because it looks like those caramel chocolate pudding packs. haha...Well I have to go to bed now, I've gotta get up at 5 am. GOODNIGHT ALL! ~Bayz

      FINALLY! Finals are over, no more stress over school work for 2 months. YES! I don't think I did too bad on my finals. The one I'm most worried about is biology or creative writing. Biology, I think I did okay, but one of the writing questions I've never even heard of. Then the creative writing I had to write a story on one of 5 pictures on the board. The max was one and a half pages. not one full piece of paper, one side and half of the other. My story had to end really fast and doesn't sound good. Plus i left one of the short answer questions blank. OH well IT'S OVER NOW! This weekend I still have to get up though...earlier than normal. 5! That's the earliest EVER! lol I hate getting up early but money is awesome. Then I'll be able to pay for things.  ~Bayz

      Well today was the first day of finals. I had Swimming, (ooh hard haha)and WA state history. The swimming one was filling out a reflection sheet and answering questions like "What grade to you think you diserve in this class? NAME THREE REASONS NOW BIATCH!" and "how will this physical education class help you in everyday life" It was so boring. After that, Em, Jesse, Amber and I chilled outside. It was still hella boring. My history final wasn't as easy, I don't think I did too bad on it. I'm thinking A-, B+ or B range. WOO! It took me 2½ hours to make that note card, but I used it. lol, after the final I screwed around with the camera. I LOVE PICTURES! Tomorrow I have my Creative Writing and Math final. I HOPE I DO GOOD! For the creative writing one, we have to match a bunch of terms, but we have to write a story. The writing a story on the spot is gonna be hard. MATH! Oh math, that's gonna be a silly final. I'm not really lookin forward to that one. OH well, gotta do it.  I should start studying...i used my early release well. Well, the viking tasted good so hey what are ya gonna do? LATERz  ~Bayz

      I finally have a job. A JOB! How crazy is that gonna be? MONEY! I got a job with Emily in Seattle working for holland america. I only have to work on sat and sun, but I have to give up a lot of stuff. I'm gonna start next weekend, and work until october. It's going to be long 10 hour days, but It's money, and I can sleep in on the weekends. Em said i'm gonna like the people there too. I hope so, hope they don't hate me...I already have an insider though...(Thanks Em ;)) Well, I can't go on my 4th of july vaca with Alex anymore, and I can't go on the "girls day out" thing I usually do with my mom, aunt and my grandma. It's sad, but true. I might have to give up my annual vaca with Alexia. I think it will be worth it though....good-bye childhood :(.   ~Bailey

      Hey, Jebus, I just got done with my sonnet. THAT TOOK SOO LONG! I don't know exactly how long, but it felt like 6 months. lol wanna read it? Well I'm gonna put it on here anyways. It sucks, but it took forever to write so I'm leavin' it. Hahaha  “What to say” By: Bailey Luder What do you say when there’s nothing to say And an awkward silence fills the cold air? What do you say after the guy says “hey”? You respond to the word and just stand there There’s many things you wish you could mention  But it’s impossible at the same time You’d do anything to break the tension  Only two minutes feels like a lifetime. Both of you struggle for some kind of words You are stuck looking at each other’s face Look to the side, try not to look forwards Now you both are starring out into space. He looks into your eyes for one last glance, “Well, gotta go,” he left, you lost your chance.  Meh...Anyways 6 more to write... LATERz

      Well right now I feel a lot better than yesterday and this morning. This morning I was about ready to cry :( awww.... lol. I went to the walk-in clinic at about 9am. After waiting around for about 2 hours, I learned what I need to do is take 3 IBprophin every 4 hours. My mom bought me a strawberry-banana milkshake becuz I hadn't eaten in 39 hours and it helps to have something in your stomach before taking medication. It took about 2 hours before I felt something, then after 4 hours it felt better, after I took the second dose it has been getting better. I can still feel it, but it's way less painful then the past 2½ days. YAY!  I'm still thinking if I want to go to school tomorrow. I think I can make it...but that might be the IBprophin talking. Plus, swimming is gonna blow chunkz, but I could get a note from my mom. I'm pretty sure Im going, but tomorrow I have so many things due. *sighs* I can't break my 3 year streak now, with only 17 days left of school. I better start my HW.  ~Bayz

      I'm sick as hell today. I started feeling it last night but I thought it was just from choking on the sweetart juice. I wish that's what it was. Last night Vicki Spent the night, thank gawd we slept in separate rooms. I woke up at 11:30 shaking from being so cold. I was rubbing my skin to warm me up, and it feels like I rubbed all of it off. I got up, went to the bathroom, closed the window, grabbed an extra blanket, and put on my sweatshirt then went to bed. It took me a while to fall back asleep, then at 1:00am I woke up again shaking. I got up, went to the bathroom and searched for some night times medicine. It took a long time to kick in, so I was lying on my air matress in the computer shaking for about an hour before I stopped shaking. Oh, that's when I had to pee again, right when I was trying to get back to sleep. Good times. Vicki woke me up around 9ish, and I got up and checked my temp. It was 104.3. That's good right? lol It's gone up and down all day it's ranged anywhere from 99.9 to 104.5. It's like a rollercoaster, except not the fun kind. Right now my throat hurts worse then it's ever hurt before in my entire life. The medication only lowers my fever, it did nothing for my throat. I haven't eaten anything all day. I can't even get water down. It's either hot or freezing. I hate being sick...

      Hey,  I went to Seattle today for a field trip to seattle. It was pretty awesome. We went to Pike place market, and searched for what a "Charengo" (I think) is. I took Vicki, Marissa and I about an hour to find it. Finally we found out It's a weird guitar type thing. Haha. I got some cool stuff I got a necklace, a banana smootie (awesome), some of those little donuts from the stand, and a 1.90 peach that wasn't worth it. I guess you can't save money at the Pike Place Market.  OH! There was this old guy that rambled on about the ice cream place (where later on we bought out smoothies and Ice cream) for like 5 minutes staright. Not even Exagerating. It was sad, but funny. Oh well. The Museum was alright, the tour guide lady spent WAY too long on one picture. I liked when we go tot wander around for myself. It was awesome, I got to look at what I wanted, for how long I wanted. There was some odd stuff there. There was this photo  which was doctored to look like a human Ken doll. He was naked with no Penis, balls, or nipples. It was crazy. I really liked it. One that was awesome in it's own way was a photo of a man with a huge stitched cut on the top of his head, extending down to his cheeks on both sides.  It was crazy. Well, there's school tomorrow and I haven't taken my shower yet. Laterz ~Bailey

       Well...so far this has been  the best summer ever ! I've had so much fun! Work isn't the best, but it gets me money for the fun...although my check still hasn't come.     &nbsp;  Yesterday was awesome! Stina, Derek and I went to flowing lake. We burnt our feet on the sand when we were playing volleyball with some little kids. After that we went swimmin' in the lake. It's a nice lake, but it's full of rocks and it's pretty shallow. 400 lasted about 10 seconds....it's hard when the rocks were attacking your feet. I had flip-flops on though, so I was alright. When we were getting ready to leave we were feeding the ducks, and the ranger guy was like "DON'T FEED THE DUCKS! I WILL KILL YOU!" ....well, instead of "I will kill you" it was "it will make them sick" but it was almost the same.     &nbsp;  We all went back to Stina's and made sandwiches. I made the best bagel-cream cheese-salami sandwhich ever. They had boring Ham and Cheese. haha. We drove over to Langis (Sure that's right) Park and had a picnic over-looking the ocean. Stina slipped on a water bottle when she was trying to leap over Derek and landed straight on her back. She was like pissing her pants laughing. :-D   At the park we played silly kids games, and swung for like 45 mins before we had to go home.   After that we all went to my house and chilled out in the hottub for like 2 hours. We talked, listened to music,&nbsp;and gazed at the stars. I SAW 8 SHOOTING STARS! I wasted all of them on one stupid wish too...     &nbsp;  When we all got back to Christina's, we were all jazzed and not tired so we thought we could stay up for the Dane Cook DVD since Derek hadn't seen it. Nope, we all pretty much fell asleep on the couches. Stina suggested we go to bed, so we got ready and we all slept on Stina's bed. Stina was the pimp in the middle of Derek and I. Haha, at 6:45 I woke up becuz Stina was&nbsp;snoring directly into my eardrum. I stumbled my way to the floor and fell asleep...The alarm went off at 10ish becuz we had to leave to pick up Colin at like 12. We all heard the alarm, and we all fell right back asleep. I was awakend by Derek getting up saying it was 12. Haha, Silly us.   We picked up Colin, then dropped him off, dropped Derek off at his house, and Stina & I went back to her house to watch TV for a while. Then at 4 I went home. Good times.    &nbsp;  ~Bayz

      Hey,  Well I just woke up from a really long nap. It was only about... 4½ hours. Haha I when to sleep at around 6pm and now it's 10:47. I'm still pretty tired too. I guess it must be lack of sleep during the weekend. I got 5 hours of sleep before work on saturday, and 6 hours before work on sunday. It was hard at work those days. It's okay if it takes me awhile during the week, becuz then I can sleep in. Though, on the weekends 5am comes up FAST.   Oh well what are ya gonna do. I probably won't be up too much longer, I'm still tired. Laterz  ~Bayz

      well today was like a game...accept not. Last night I went to bed at 9:30 thinking that will help me get enough sleep. Wow was I wrong. I was tossing and turning, thinking, listening to the fireworks and my parents blasting the tv, until about 4am. Of course some of that stuff drained out like the fireworks and the tv. That was horrible.   This morning I wasn't woken up by the alarm I must have set wrong. I was wakin up by my mom saying "Shouldn't you be up by now" I glance at the clock to see that it was 6:00am. Emily had come to my house at 5:55am and thought I forgot about work and left me here. Still half asleep, I run around the house trying to get ready. Which I did get done in 15mins. My mom offered to drive me, and woke my dad up so he could drive.   I get to work on time thank gawd, but I'm still tired as hell from getting only 2 hours of sleep. I got to work in luggage. I asked people what color their baggage tags were, and SO many people discribed their actual bag, or I'd say "Hi, which color baggage tag to you have?" their responce would be "H". So I'd have to look it up and send them off in the direction of the bags with that tag color which was usually packed full of other confused people.   YES! Finally done with that...15 mins til check-in. Check-in isn't too bad. It hurts to stand on concrete for 8-10 hours, and when people don't have all of their information filled out. That sucks because you have to sit there and wait 600 years before they are done, and then tell them what they did wrong.  Of course, at peak hours the computers go DOWN. That's always fun to deal with. Checking everyone in manually. The passengers are usually okay with it. Then there are some that are like "What...computers...they did what? how? can you fix it right now?" lol. Well I'm gonna go..  ~Bayz

       Damn! Today was crazy. It was rainy, then sunny, then it poured, and then sunny again, and it is now raining but sunny. It's awesome! During the thunder, lightning and the buckets of rain, I was driving in Everett. I was so excited. I opened my windows and everytime it lightninged (That doesn't sound right...meh) I would get all excited. There was a river of water flowing to my right near the sidewalk. I wanted to play in it so bad! I love hard rain. I wish it did that more often.       Well, I've gota an hour before I have to go to bed...Stupid work. LATERz      ~Bayz
