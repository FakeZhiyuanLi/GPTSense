      Ford announced the introduction of the first hybrid SUV! Cooooooooooool. We are taking a serious look at trading in our slightly dented Jeep for a Hybrid car or SUV. If we can get approved for a loan (the major obstacle for us...) we will go ahead with our idea most likely. We will save $100's of dollars a year in gas....the Jeep ate $25 of gas in two weeks going about a mile or so a day. What crap!!!! SOOOOOOO since gas prices are not likely to ever get back to the .95 cents a gallon they were when I graduated from high school....we are looking at our options.   The Massachusettes Supreme Court made a mini step in Gay Marriage Rights today. YAY! I have a certain kind of UU faith that the home state and base for Unitarian Universalism will be the first state to have truly legally recognized gay marriage. There was a woman last named Rios who was quoted as saying "Gay Marriage will be bad for families." Whose family? Hers? As if over population wasnt an issue, as if all these Christians just skipped the part in the bible that says only god will judge...as if any of these people have every met a gay family!!!! GAH. I get so frustrated sometimes.  Henry went to the Vet today. He did great as always. He loves car trips, but I decided it was time that our cat started to wear a collar. He disagreed immensly at first. But he seems pretty used to the contraption by now. We didnt get a safety catch collar as Henry is a notorious escape artist with those quick-release collars. It has a normal buckle and in every way appears to be an ordinary collar. However, there is one link that has elastic in it that stretches so as to help the cat out of a choke situation. Of course, before he got used to the collar he tried to choke himself by gagging. Silly kitty. I just realized he is looking over my shoulder as I type..ummmm not so silly kitty?  I think my inlaws are going to get their digital camera too finally. It has been months in the doing that this digital camera is coming their way. I did a bunch of research and we headed to Circuit City to look at the model...of course we weren't going to buy it there...I found it for less at Amazon.com...but we could see the camera in person at our local Circuit City :) My mother in law quit smoking...and it seems that in her moods and whatnot my father in law will go to any ends to appease her so as to help her not smoke. Its working out well for her so far :)  Oh and yeah WVU Financial Aid office STILL cant get my financial aid right. If I didnt babysit my account and their office I would totally be screwed beyond belief on a regular basis. They applied their full bill to my first summer session of classes but couldnt be bothered to apply my full aid to the first summer session as well!!!! HOW MUCH MORE WORK IS THAT REALLY!?!?! They make sure they get their money, but leave me high and dry!!! The Ohio University FA office was NEVER this bad. I will call back on Monday....I called today and it was supposed to be taken care of today...BUT NOOOOOO I checked this evening and NO CHANGE. GRRRRRRR. I keep envisioning writing a very harsh letter to someone with power....to not let WVU disperse financial aid period unless they get their act together. I know, this could shoot me in the foot...but they wouldnt risk losing their students for lack of FA offered...they would get their office together!!!! *Wonders who to write about this issue other than her two blog readers*  Well for now that is all the news in fits of print. --Mack

      Here I am again. Awake. Another night where my sleep schedule will get buggered for the sake of sleeplessness. If I stay in bed I just toss and turn and interupt my dear husband's sleep - as much of a "Mission Impossible" as that is. (That man could sleep through WW3 and I keep hoping that WW3 wont happen so that he wont get the chance to try.)   Skimming through the news I see that Rumsfeld has declared that there are no military cover-ups. Oh yeah, and we trust him NOW? You think they would have sent someone ELSE over there to check this stuff out, not the guy who had his own little mini cover-up going. Who does the thinking for these people? I wish I knew more people from around the world...I wonder if the people in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, etc...I wonder if they BELIEVE the US government. We all know the Middle East does not. I can't say that I blame them for their distrust.  After some indepth double team researching in the field of the digital camera I think my husband and I have decided on a Minolta Z2 4.0 Megapixel Camera. It has the auto and manual functions that we need (and my photo class in the fall will require...) and it's not too over the top. At least one side of my family has always owned Minoltas...so I feel good about investing our digital camera budget and then some...into a Z2.  Next week silly unemployed me goes back to work at least for the summer. I will be working at the YMCA here in my hometown...again. And working 6:30ish AM to 12:30ish PM doing something hopefully useful for the summer camp. I also hope that at some point in time I will get to work on their next program guide. Graphic Layout and Design being a one of my passions, and something I also happen to be reasonably good at. Besides, I will have my own awesome digital camera to use to get some great snaps of summer camp and other YMCA events. I will be doing summer camp training next week...whee. Then we will be cleaning up the camp-grounds...organizing puzzles and board games and whatnot. Then *drum roll goes here* summer day camp will begin. There are alot of kids and counselors I am looking forward to seeing from last summer...and a few I am praying either A) do not return or B) stay very far away from me - especially if weilding poison ivy or in are a foul mood.  I like working with older kids mostly. 11 years old and up. I get along with them well, my sense of justice and logic appeals to them. I keep my fingers on the pulse of teen coolness and trends...so I dont seem too much like a completely out of step adult or something. Plus I am a music afficianado, and still to this day there is not much of more import and impact on a teens day to day life than music. All of the teens and preteens will not likely agree on what they categorize as good music, but they define themselves by it, they reflect their music tastes in their self image, and its of definite importance that someone they identify with A) love music, B) have some idea what it is that they listen to, and C) dont seem too stodgy about their musical tastes. More or less thats me. I like rap - the Beastie Boys are great!!!! I like Hip-Hop - if and only if I am dancing. I like punk - just about any time. I like "classics and oldies" and "80's" TONS....all of these things have been making a comeback. Plus, the cool thing is that I was able to share some of my wealth of music knowledge with the kids...explaining to them why the Beatles are resposible for rap (and yes, they knew who the Beatles are) and opening their eyes to the difference between cover songs, song writers, performers, and musicians. I even got to point out that lyrics are just poetry set to rhthym (Score one for the English Literature Department...as I challenged them to find a poem and turn it into a rap.) Hehehe. Not a camp-wide activity...just a fun thing that I thought of. Its not a revolutionary idea...I mean it HAS been thought of before. But no one in the path of these youths had presented it to them. So there I was at the right time in the right place. Woohoo. The more I talk about it the more I look forward to seeing the great and awesome kids from last year, and the more I forget about my poison ivy friend and others that were less than pleasant in the experiences we shared.  Note: Insomnia causes ultimate babbling.  Well...I should try to make an attempt to sleep again I suppose. I feel guilty if I dont at least attempt to go to bed a couple of times....like I am not really TRYING to go to sleep or something.  Dont let the bed bugs bite. --Mack

      It was titled, "Oh, did I mention my In-Laws are Republican?"  Yeah and basically the gist of it was this...we need more political parties so as to better represent the populous. This two party system is leaving most of america behind. We need to let new parties shine through that vary in beliefs in degrees. It will help the elected officials truly understand the concept of  compromise, and it will help eliminate the extremists. Extremists who get votes now because people would rather vote for someone in their party than the opposition party. Imagine if they had more parties to chose from? If someone actually met their needs? Sure the majority levels for each individual candidate would be lower BUT the overall representation would be improved.  And the other major topic of my mysteriously disappearing blog is that it is one of those "this is so my life" coincidences that at the same time it would be become financially necessary to move in with my in-laws it would be an election year.I am very political and opinionated. They are registered and tried and true republicans. My husband and I democrats...but most importantly socially liberal and fiscally social(istic.) I do try not to push too many hot buttons. I cant help but crack a few jokes....Bush is in town today and my mom called yesterday to ask if I wanted to go to the Anti-Bush demonstration. I dont like crowds and I protest daily here so I kindly said no. I also wanted to keep the peace here in the free housing we are receiving. I joked with his dad that my mom called and asked him to come to the protest...he thought that was a hoot. (whew!) Although, I must admit that its easier living with republicans than anarchist communists. Its easier to completely disagree with someone rather than agree with their premises and disagree with their outcomes.   Right...well in the original version of this blog I talked about how trying to please every voter will please no one...and that we need a multiparty system so as to truly reflect the different views of the american electorate. People arent voting because no one represents them closely enough. They disagree with something essential from both sides...thus we need more sides. I dont propose we do this through bloody revolution (but you can ask my anarchist communist friends about that...) rather we must make our system more flexible and make it possible for the mutiparty.  Saw Bush's speech today. The best and only good moment was when he told our mayor to "get those potholes filled." About time someone ABOVE the political level of the mayor told him so:P Bush is a pompous ass. Those educators who sat in on the "discussion on education" are crazy. There were there just sitting there, going along with him. When I KNOW for a fact that most teachers and administrators HATE the "No Child Left Behind" premise. The exams test a childs ability to take a test...not on whether they have learned. Plus they lost many more teaching days to taking the tests so they have fewer learning days in school. PLUS Bush mentioned the bill he is trying to get through Congress to get professionals as teachers in the classroom. There are already NOT ENOUGH JOBS FOR ALL THE TEACHERS OUT THERE....he has some balls to say that he would be giving professionals teaching jobs in a room full of teachers.    All in all, as he talked about putting every american child into college I am left wondering two things. 1) What will happen to Labor work that does not require a college education? For example my husband has a college degree in media studies and started a career in radio - an industry that by and far doesnt require or need one. He got off to his career 4 years late because of going to college, and now that hes old enough that hes married and could be wanting to have a family, or just in general have more financial responsibilities, hes four years behind in income and its not working out well at all. Just one more reason hes going to study computer science.... and 2) What will all the american kids that are going to college going to do without adequate financial aid to stay there. 10,500 a year and thats for junior and seniors only. For undergrad first years its something like 4500-6500 aid. THAT BARELY COVERS TUITION AT MOST PLACES. And 10500 barely covers tuition at many. I mean public schools here...even in-state tuition rates.   When are they going to raise the ceiling of available aid and financial need? Tuition goes up EVERY YEAR...why dont the loan amounts go up as well??? We are starting to get out of balance and they arent even doing a damn thing about it. Grrrrr. Plus they need to raise the maximum loan limit, $136,000 total really limits your time in college pending the amount of loans you have needed. Poor people who have needed loans all through college, cant get PhDs as they have maxxed out their spending before they get to that point. And if they up the annual budget bubbles they will have to up the overall budget bubble too. I just hope that this happens BEFORE I get out of school.  Thats all the news in fits of print...

      My computers is acting all blitzkriegy. Half loading anything internet related. "My Excite" wont load but Google loves me as usual. My hotmail is being a pain in the arse. GAH! *shakes laptop computer visciously* .... *looks around to make sure no one was filming* CPU ABUSE!!!!  Once I do a google search, I click on an option that was found and then IT won't open!!!  I feel the need to send BunBun after Microsoft. Pete can you arrange that? (Note: see online comic Sluggy Freelance if you want to understand that reference.) Does Microsoft have a holiday? CAN WE INVENT ONE?????  Its bad enough that I am cleaning and doing laundry today, but now my CPU has to putz out on me too.  Today isnt going to be a good day.  --Mack

      I cant believe the headlines really say. "Berg had been advised to leave Iraq." Hello, he was advised to leave by the same organization that advised him to go there in the first place, was he not? They are telling a headless man, "WE TOLD YOU SO!" *shakes her own well-attached head in disbelief*  Iraq abuse has been quoted as being seen as vigilante justice. THERE IS NO JUSTICE THERE - Vigilante or otherwise. Bush just likes nice words that have a bit of a ring to them. Who cares whether they make any sense or are accurate. The word justice has no business coming anywhere near the Iraq abuse cases....except perhaps in the trials of the accused and their superiors. Injustice however is getting its word workout for the week. Oh and hey, the Red Cross says the abuse is a wide spread problem...the guilty party - the military - says its a focused incident. Who do you believe?  Read about Bush's "white people" gaff. I can't believe that isnt all over the media. Who is sitting on this one and not letting it out?  I can't believe Sen. John McCain - R AZ. was asking a military panel whether the US should have signed the Geneva convention...and Sen. James Inholfe - R. OK.  was saying the prisoners deserved their treatment (they committed crimes to be in Abu Grahaib is his logic...) and that we should be concerned with the status of our soldiers. Yeah, since we clearly dont go by the Geneva Conventions - one of the marks of a "progressive and modern" nation - we need to be concerned about all American troops captured or being held. Just ask Nick Berg. And McCain is a former POW at that. Sure McCain, we should un-sign a document that narrowly is one of the only forms of protection US POWs have (when fighting organized government enemies.) Its not perfect - but its SOMETHING. And it serves as an international checks and balance system in the theatre of war - you take care of my soldiers, I will take care of yours. Rumsfeld informed us that the Geneva Conventions dont apply when fighting terrorists. For such a "Christian Nation" the government sure chooses when and where to apply its values. What happened to turning the other cheek? What happened to doing unto others blah blah blah *insert golden rule here*? Out the door with the bathwater I suppose. And then following Inholfe's train of logic leads this way: Inholfe has said that the prisoners in Abu Grhaib are there because they are criminals (no trials here folks!) and that their treatment is a result of that. Thus Inholfe believes that wives that get beaten deserve it, women that get raped have earned it, and that certainly any incarcerated prisoners deserve to be broken. So think Inholfe will get the US inmate vote next election in Oklahoma? How to idiots like this get to be elected? OH YEAH ITS THAT 33% VOTER TURN OUT THING!!!! VOTE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont care what party you are. As long as you do some thinking, some minimal research, and GO VOTE!!!!!  Saw a news article on TV saying Kerry needs to find his "inner Arnold" so as to unite the two political parties. Arnold's "magic" is he has no experience and no idea what he's doing so he turns to the experts on the issues...regardless of their political party. He's not really a "politician" in the partisan sense. Arnold's magic does not work on everyone. I am not sure Kerry has an Arnold within him ( and thats probably a good thing as steroids in a candidate for president cant be healthy.)  I am not sure if there is any true "politician" out there that will do non-partisan work just to get the opinions and efforts of the person who has the most expertise - regardless of their political fencing.  But perhaps, with a good audition, Kerry just might be able to get a bit part in Terminator 4  - where the United States realizes that President Bush is an evil robot sent from the future to destroy our country and Kerry has to rescue us all....Think it would sell?  On the other hand, maybe our political parties dont cooperate well because why? Too few political parties for one thing. We are a "highly polarized"electorate and our public officials dont want to lose re-election due to "sleeping with the enemy." Which brings me around to my last rant for the moment....we elect politicians to represent us. Then they get in office and do their own thing. Assuming that since we elected them, we must agree with them. NO NO NO NO NO. Politicians are supposed to REPRESENT their electorate...not decide for them...not impose their own opinions on their constituents. (Inholfe's constituents were quoted as finding his opinion not representative of Oklahoma thinking....)It seems public officials forget that they dont answer to and for the people every 4 years or so...but every day. *sigh*  I am going back to sleep now. Maybe when I wake up there will be some kind of "good news" out there....like A Team reruns coming back, or the Knight Rider coming back in syndication. But I am not holding my breath.  --Mack

      I know, I know - its so very un-hip, un-alternative, un-left leaning politics to go to Wal-Mart to shop. But do you know what its like to live in a small town and be very poor? (I did mention complaining about being poor in my blog description...consider this a mini dose...) There are few stores around here anymore. The ones that have survived the Wal-Martians invasion are STILL big corporations anyways....and they charge MORE for everything. We can't afford shopping at KMART even...or sometimes cant afford shopping at Krogers (which has almost vanished from our local landscape...they used to be my favorite place to shop...) We certainly cant afford the Giant Eagle across the river in Ohio, nor could we afford the BigBears (now all four area stores are gone...) when they were here. Foodland? HA! IGA? HA! The health food stores? DOUBLE HA! I grew up eating the organic foods and health food store goodies. I CANT AFFORD THEM NOW!!!! Ug. Right, so Wal-Mart it is. There doesnt seem to be anywhere else to go really anyways. Even Aldi's cant be trusted on prices....they run out of things so fast that by the time you get there their advertisements were empty messages and a person just wasted gas driving a few miles past Wal-Mart for a bargain that wasnt there anymore. Evil empire.   Soon we will be moving to an area that, although there are Wal-Marts, there is alot more competition. I am pretty sure the Wal-Mart in our new town will not be a Super Wal-Mart. Thus, there are plenty of grocery stores still in existence to choose from with fairly low prices.  My mother in law drives all over town following the mark downs and coupons. Soon she will realize that the fuel she is burning is more costly than getting that double coupon.  Gas prices = 1.99 here. 44 cents or more of that is tax from the federal and state government. We drive a Jeep Cherokee. We drive less than 1 mile per day for the last two weeks. We use 25$ worth of gas in 14 days. Thats 14 Miles. Thats one mile per gallonish. How in the hell is that possible? Needless to say I want to trade in the gas guzzeler. My husband clings to being able to look down on the other drivers in traffic from his SUV seat. Its his vehicle...but the gas prices are going to kill us. I will continue working on my mission to get him to trade in the Jeep for a more fuel efficient car in the upcoming weeks. I welcome any suggestions.  --Mack  PS: Its so late its early. I am going to head to bed. Night night.

      It is thought that I should explain this reference. Apparently one of the local grocery stores has a banana discount on Tuesdays. This causes Wal-Mart to mark down their bananas every Tuesday so as to compete. SO if you want bananas  - buy them on Tuesdays. There seems to be a local banana price war going on. It became a big joke for my husband and I "Banana Tuesdays." There are people out there who rescheduled their grocery shopping trips for Banana Tuesdays...and I know we have made many an extra trip just to bananas on a tuesday. These days, the gas price and cost balances out any money one might have saved on Banana Tuesday...so its really not worth an extra trip. But if bananas are your fruit of choice...Tuesdays are your favorite day of the week. Thus Banana Tuesday.  --Mack

      Small town elections are a hoot. First of all, there are mini buffet tables set up by some mysterious ladies with unknown interests or connections to the elections. Brownies, cookies, chicken salad sandwiches, soda pop, raw veggie trays, more cookies....really an obscene amount of food. Then there is the media room.  Consisting of a few beat reporters from our one local newspaper, and one new representative from each of the major radio networks here in town, and the main news reporter for the TV station. Then me....stringing for a state news service. Moonlighting for one night. One newspaper guy has known me and my family since I was three years old. One girl there with the paper and I are co-alums from OU and were there at the same time...and I have met before when I had to get something from the paper when I was doing marketing work. The TV news reporter I have seen on the evening and morning news everyday since I was 5 or so. There was an air of small town celebrity about him that made me wonder when he got quite so old. I know both of the radio station representatives fairly well either by association or personal acquaintaince. It was a good old meeting of the minds if you will. All of these media folks look at each other as competition but they dont mind sharing computers or tidbits of information to get a story out or an interesting angle. How odd. At any rate. So there I am occassionally reloading and updating the networked website link, watching precints get added to the report. Some races are close...some are so distant I wondered if a candidate did any advertising whatsoever. One candidate is nicknamed "Icky." Seriously John "Icky" Doe - or whateveer his name was - was how it was listed. He got less than 50 votes.  Throughout the night...local candidates would sneak up behind me and check on their races....or public officials will check on their friends. "How's the so and so race?" "She/He is winning by a nose." "Oh good, she/he is me!" I stifled my laughter. I tried to give them hope, and reminded them that who new which precincts were in and maybe their district hasnt been tallied yet and what not...Me? Giving politicians pep talks? Yup. Will wonders never cease. I overheard an interesting interview from the county democratic party chair regarding Bush's Thursday visit to my region and the "welcome" the democrats have planned. Now that made me really smile.  I was given the chance to strut my state political and constitutional knowledge. One race tonight...a levy, had to win by 60% majority. It did not pass although it had a 57% majority vote. The reason is that my state's constitution requires any local or municipality or county tax to go up for public vote and must win by 60% majority - this was to prevent frivolous taxation of the people - other than the taxation imposed by the state government of course. And any change to the state constitution has to pass a similar test...and get a certain percentage of voter turn out. Talk about checks and balances. West Virginia being a state isnt even legal really...In order to succeed from Virginia the Congress of Virginia was to vote on the succession of any part of the state. Well, only the counties that were to be included in the succession's congress representatives did the vote - not all of the Virginia state representatives. They also held this vote in the expected new state capital - not the established Virginia state capital. And only in those counties did they hold the general succession election that had to pass by a popular election - the voters had to vote behind union troops lines, and the voting officials were allowing union non resident soldiers to vote to boot. There are a million holes in the formation of my state. But here we are with state representatives only in office for three months out of the year. But oy, I have gotten off subject. The primary election in my county had a 33% voter turn out. Its hard to motivate the voters for WV primaries because again of WV state law. When voting in WV primaries, you must vote your registered party. This means that independents have to vote for independents and if there are none (which is often the case...) they cant vote at all. Democrats and Republicans are also drawn down party lines. I am not sure as to the origin of this seemingly unconstitutional law....but it sure makes people think before declaring themselves an Independent or any other non traditional party for that matter. My job for the night was simple...occassionally call and update a news service on the eletion standings for specific state and county and local races. Simple. Straightforward. Important sounding. I figure that is enough rambling about small town elections. Suffice to say that it was a night of being in a roomful or building full of people who either know my dad, my mom, my step dad, my bio dad, or someone related to me in some way. I got directons to the house I spent time in from the ages of 3 to 4 or so. I got to hear stories about my mom and me when I was three. I got to "hobnob" with the nobbiest nobs you can find around here....and I got some good small town gossip and a good chicken salad recipe to boot.  -Mack

      Its Tuesday. Its primaries in West Virginia. Its Banana Tuesday.   It comes to me as no surprise that many government workers have bogus degrees. It really goes to show how very useless a "real" college degree can be. It apparently did not make much of a difference in the running of the government. I guess the uselessness of college degrees explains why I have such a broad collection accumulating.  Oust Rumsfeld? Hell no, take down Bush! The easiest way to resign Rumsfeld is to vote Bush out!!! The prisoner abuses are terrible, frightening, and horrendous...but not shocking. We are dealing with the military and CIA and information accumulation. How many times have you seen in the movies where information is gotten from people by extreme duress by a government agent. This concept was not invented by the movie industry - it came from somewhere.   Where's MacGyver when you need him? He could take out any terrorist organization with one Swiss Army Knife tied behind his back. Bring back Richard Dean Anderson!  More pointless musings from me will be available in the future.  Remember - dont take me too seriously, I am terribly tongue in cheek. If I have offended, then it might have been intentionally - which means that I am just pushing your buttons to see what happens. In which case, humor me.   In the mean time read Sluggy Freelance and feel niftier by the day. http://www.sluggy.com/  --Mack

      I took a short Cat Nap this morning. I accidentally (more or less accidentally) fell asleep on the futon this morning...and woke up to find the cat curled up with me. Cat Nap indeed. It was so cute I didnt want to get up - even though I had to pee really badly. Poor kitty I woke him up about 5 minutes later when I just couldnt hold it any longer. He glared at me with a look that said, "I knew I should have litter trained you."  Oh and among the national/political news there is this tiny headline that say recent Whitehouse Medicare commercials have been ruled as illegal. They have been determined to be propaganda paid for with tax payers money and without Congressional approval. These are the recent series of ads depicting the Medicare changes as a boon to seniors and having a "reported by" tag with a name like "reported by Karen Jones" at the end. In reality these commercials were paid for by the feds and sposored by the Whitehouse, but no where in these ads does it say so. In fact the group that is in charge of monitoring these thing also said some of the informtion within the ad is not correct and suspect. And that it is misleading in presenting itself as a news report. But he could hang the "illegal" label on the commercials when there was no recognition of government provision or funding. I wonder what will happen to Bush & Crew over this? It hasnt generated too big a stir yet, but has AARP sunk its teeth into the issue yet?  Well onto textbook reading! --Mack

      School: I am starting my reading today. I swear. No late work is accepted for this online class I am currently enrolled in. Eeep. Part of my homework requires me to watch an hour of TV. Murder She Wrote here I come!  Library: Went to our county library last night. Got lots of books to read. A SciFi-ish book or two, some mysteries, a Dostoyevsky, and a book about the "madman" that turned in most of the submissions for the original Oxford English Dictionary (an etimologists guide book as it tracks original usage of words.) Its so funny that a place can change so much and not change at all. I mean, I have been going to that library since I was old enough to read. Everytime I had a project due for something - Social Studies Fair, Independent Study, Science Fair - I would spend hours at that library desperately doing research the old fashioned way. In fact, once when we were in junior high my now husband and I bumped into each other at that library and spent the day together. (I reference it in his 8th grade year book in a relatively embarrasingly flirtatiously sappy yearbook signing.) Such historical significance. Soon though I will be able to renew my books online. The library (which is totally a modernistic bastion to concrete block) will enter the space age. It was encouraging and slightly depressing at the same time that the old card catalogue bins were no longer present and accounted for. On the plus side, it seemed busier than I remember it being before...so their updates must be good for business. I cant imagine the tediousness required in changing a library over from Card Catalogue and Apple II E's to a networked and contemporary system. I almost miss the old DOS based book search system...almost. Now, if we could just get more and more varied new releases the library will have become heaven. My husband located check-outable graphic novels (Batman, Spiderman, etc - nothing Manga-esque or anything) and we figure that is a step in the right direction.  A funny side note: I read a story online from USAToday that was about the Interstate and Highways Bill that the House and Senate passed and Bush is threatening a veto of if they dont cut the budget on it down to a useless amount. The article was focussed on the fixing of a major bottleneck in the highway/bridge system outside of Cincinnatti - and the amount within the Bill as it stands to help solve this issue. Some of the other items mentioned in the bill are things as varied as bike paths, walking paths, and filling pot holes. This bill applies in some way and gives money to nearly every state in the union. Including West Virginia. Pot Hole filling. West Virginia. Reminds me of something the President told our Mayor last week, "Get those pot holes filled." And he's gonna veto the bill to pay for it. *sigh* In the meantime this bill has united Republicans and Democrats against Bush (for this cause at least.) The Congress cites studies done regarding the amount needed for investment to keep our interstate system current...and showing the need for the spending. And across the board the support for the bill is mostly non-partisan. It is highly possible that if Bush vetoes it the Congress will override his Veto. Woot. Hehehe.  Posted below this blog is another example of how much my new toy rocks. That is me. Me in our Jeep. Me in our Jeep that is going 45 mph or so when I took this picture. :) For those of you loyal blog readers (all two or so of you) requesting a photo...there you have it.  I cant believe its really Friday - this week has simply flown by.  Oh and yesterday we also viewed another DVD that we rented. Yesterdays fare was Kung Fu Jackie Chan Makes An Appearance goodness. It was titled the Vampire Effect. And, although we expected the worst, it was actually quite good. I voted it better than the Medallion. The story line was fairly creative for a vampire/vampire hunter flick, the characters all had their little quirks, there was some good slapstick style humor - without being too much, there was a cool chick fight kung fu style over a teddybear at the beginning, and in general there was enough bizarreness to have a good time without losing the movie entirely. The special effects were surprisingly good, and the chinese style floaty wire work (and using it alot) actually worked for this movie as vampires are in theory supposed to move like that. We enjoyed some chinese food from our favorite (and very good for being in a small ass town) Chinese restaurant - The Great Wall. And also upheld our Jackie Chan tradition of watching said movie with a friend who I will call "Pirate Monkey" since I am keeping everyones anonymity :) Pirate Monkey is a long time friend of my husbands - who I have also known since junior high. Ug. We are from a small town. Pirate Monkey is likely Jackie Chan's number one fan, and if I could I would totally arrange for him to meet Chan as a birthday present or something. We have the same birthday after all - Pirate Monkey and I that is :)  Does anyone else get tired of the world sitting at the precipice of distaster and refusing to jump off the fence either way? I do. Israel. Iraq. Afghanistan. The insanity of it all. I dont think I will ever grasp the arab-jewish issues - 1000's of years of disagreeing and not even modern conflict resolution techniques will work. Sometimes I feel like we should kick everyone out of the holy land if they cant come to an agreement. Or just split it in half in a way that makes everyone the loser - King Solomon would be proud of that resolution :) Dont get me wrong, I am very sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish people and in fact I have alot in common with the views and religious beliefs of the most liberal group of Jewish worshippers. I would convert if I believed in conversion. It is just that its about time the hotbed of humanity had a little peace. Havent enough people suffered and died for a cause and an arguement that no one truly remembers. This whole Gaza strip thing - its not really about Gaza strip. Its about whatever it was that made Abraham and his brother part their separate ways 1000's and 1000's of years ago. Which, although it is semi-documented, no one REMEMBERS why!  Well, thats all the news in fits of print...have a great friday! --Mack

      Today is the first day of Summer Session I. I am taking Journalism 403 - Media Planning. Whee. I was registered for two classes but due to what I learned when I conquored the financial aid office, I opted instead for one class each summer session.  Financial Aid Debriefing:  After looting and pillaging their main headquarters and taking down their General Ignorance, and waiting patiently in their "waiting area," I spoke to a financial aid counselor. Who, informed me, that if I was only registered for 1 Summer Session that I would get less financial aid. (?!?!?!?) Right-oh then, it was about $1000 less for the summer package total with only being registered for one session and that just wouldnt work out at all. So I split my schedule like pea soup (but less green) once more. I dropped the class for which I havent received the book (its somewhere out there in never never land and I am going to return it the SECOND I get my hands on it....) However I am still amazed at how the only way I can get accurate and reliable information is to go to the Financial Aid office in person.  That seems like a poor choice in information dissemination for a school that sponsers a distance learning/online class program. It just doesnt seem to mesh.  Right well, after the ordeal of the financial aid office and schedule changing again (I am at the moment taking Statistics 511 for Summer Session 2 - joy of joys) the troops (my husband and I) decided to relax and enjoy Morgantown a bit.   Oh and before we went to the FA Office we took a tour if Lakeside Village - a psuedo apartment complex that we are likely to move into when we go to Morgantown. Its quite nice really in alot of ways. It feels smaller than the floor plan I drafted to match the website, and the apartment we toured was a mirror image of the floorplan I drafted out...so it was a little backwards. The closets were nice, the overall apartment was nice...but it was smaller than expected, and we could have some storage and furnishing issues potentially. However the apartment we were in is not the apartment we would move into. Most of them are different from the apartment we visited and vary on the floorplan slightly...and the kitchen counter color (thank god! - it was mauve and most of them are forest green!!!) The porch for the downstairs was very unimpressive - a concrete slab - the decks are only upstairs even though they are portrayed in the floorplan on the website as upstairs and down. I think the Master Bedroom was lacking a little in size and good design. But we can hope a place that comes open at the right time for us might be better laid out in that department. The Manager Pat was very nice and we were impressed with the overall grounds.  Okay, so now for the movie! After the FA office we went and caught a matinee at the mall and saw Shrek 2. I dont normally care for sequals much but Shrek 2 took the cake. The animation style and character designs were unchanged, but the story line was even better. The villain was much improved and helped the story along immensly. I really liked that the villain is not some ugly or malformed or inherently evil character - someone quite pleasant and pleasing who just has a character flaw if you will.   Puss in Boots was well done by Antonio Banderas if not slightly underwritten - my hubby thougt he seemed like dead weight at times, and I suggested he didnt have enough lines or personal character development. The soundtrack was excellent per expectations. The Counting Crows song was very nicely done, the version of "I need a Hero" was awesome - both in the movie and in the credits, and the Police/Sting cover was way cool. What I loved about this movie - the first one was about the support of friends/best friends - this one was about support of family and teamwork among friends. The theme was different and played well. I loved the contemporary references. They were done sooooooo well and are very current :) There are plenty of them too - and they are consistent. I like the way they play with the fairy tale world more. Everything from the shady bar and the characters within, to the appearances of the various characters at the ball. I like the overall comparison of Far Far Away to Hollywood/Beverly Hills. It plays well, and serves as a great contrast to the swamp. Another theme of Shrek 2 that they get just right is the concept of changing for the ones we love. They hit it home without breaking the bat. I like movies that use power without force. Since it was a mid week matinee during the school year we were in a nearly empty theatre...with only a few toddlers and homeschoolers about. Most of the university population had left town (unless they were taking summer classes) so it was a nice empty theatre. Bonus! I totally recommend viewing Shrek 2.   After the movie we went to our absolute favorite restuarant in Morgantown - Asian Garden. They serve a full menu of Thai, Chinese, and Malaysian food in both meat and meatless versions. According to some vegans I once knew all of their meatless dishes are vegan as well. You can get anything there - I swear. We ordered Bathing Ramna -er yeah- its a beef dish served with broccoli and peanut sauce. Its Thai :) Its delicious!  Then we headed home. On the way home we talked about my potential future jallopy and whether Luke wanted to trade in his Jeep or not for a more fuel efficient (albeit older) car. The jury is still out on that one. When we got to town we sped by our old house on the south side of town and met the temporary occupants and their kittens as I searched for the book discussed above that hasnt yet found me.  We then headed to some car lots to peruse potential junkers for me to drive :) I found a cool (read: old and retro) mercedes 83 station wagon...which it turns out they want 2995 for (ug...) I doubt its the jallopy for me. I called the small time dealership about it today...I am a little surprised they want so much for it considering I could spend the same thing on a car 10 years younger (1993 Ford Somethingerother with fewer miles and less issues...) across the street. *baffled* He said he doesnt bargain...but I will let him sweat until August and if the car is there then - offer to take it off his hands for $2000...or not. As I mentioned before it just might not be the car for me. A nice used Saab on the other hand....(not that we will find one around here...) What is it with me and Euro cars?  Oy, I am having a hard time focusing today!  When we got home from our excursion a "toy" was awaiting us...our very own Minolta Z2 digital camera!!!! Wooot. Thus the photo of my cat posted in the blog below this one :) We played with our toy for a bit and then crashed for the night. What a day it had turned out to be.  Minimal (read: No) blood was spilled in the FA office at WVU - I was feeling generous and there were too many witnesses anywho. I decided to go undercover as a confused and nice grad student...it worked like a charm.  I FINALLY got a call from the BREW beagle rescue place (I think I applied like two weeks ago...) and the lady wanted me to contact them again a month before we were moving. Fun fun. All this waiting around is going to kill me. Waiting for car, waiting for money, waiting to lose weight, waiting to go to Morgantown, wait wait wait..."Hurry Up and Wait" (Blondie - "Sunday Girl") I am extremely patient...sometimes...with kids, with animals, with most people, but I am not good at just waiting...for long periods of time.  *sigh*  all the news in fits of print...  oh and i saw an article about the highway bill and how bush is threatening to veto it if its not under a certain cost....which would be way too low to accomplish much. part of the highway bill is funding things like filling pot holes and whatnot across the US...odd that Bush mentioned to the Parkersburg mayor when he was in town that the mayor needed to "get those pot holes fixed" and now he wont approve a program that would pay for it. ironic to no end.  --mack

       urlLink    Henry-Cat. Note the spot on his nose. I first discovered this spot after I had Henry for only a short time, and right after he had been romping in my markers. So what did I do? I licked my thumb and tried to rub the "spot" off of his nose. He was less than pleased. After a few attempted removals I realized this was no marker dot, but rather a natural kitty freckle. Luckily Henry forgave me for my marker mix up, and for the ritual nose cleaning. He is four years old, and quite the little lion. This picture barely does him justice. He weighs 9.5 lbs and it is ALL FUR.&nbsp; urlLink

      To Morgantown Troops! We shall breech their walls of financial inadequacy! We shall overtake their bunkers of ineptitude! We shall conquer their office and crush the finacial aid hold music once and for alllll!!!!! Attttack!!!!!  Eh-hem...So that's how today will go potentially.  A trip to Morgantown to make sure the people that get paid 23,750 a year to be financial aid counselors DO THEIR JOBS. I was talking with a fellow WVU student last night who aggreed that if one didnt babysit the financial aid office nothing would ever be taken care of on their student account. Its hard to babysit long distance...so I am taking this up close and personal.   I will retell of my glorious trimph and how I overcame great odds to succeed later...of the gore and the bloody aftermath and the legendary hero...erm...yeah.  We are also going to visit one of our likely future residentcies since we are in town. Lakeside Village. Its very posh - posher than I have ever lived in...thats for sure. I am looking forward to getting to look around at a two bedroom apartment and getting a feel for it. Note to self: Take a measuring tape. Ack! The interior designer in me is crying out for measurement devices and drafting paper!  Last night I had another night of "training" to be a camp counselor. Recertifying in CPR. I didnt see the point as at the end of the night the instructor let us take the test as a group and shout out answers and whatnot. Besides the Red Cross should have seperate classes for certification and recertification. Duh, I remembered everything from last year nearly. Although our intstructor did tell us the little known "there is a 90% chance your victim will throw up on the rescuer when giving CPR or rescue breathing." The percentage was from his personal experience as a Lifeguard. Gotta love it.  Right well then I have to get ready to kick some financial aid ass. Over and out for now.  Mack

We have a foreign policy specialist, a security specialist, and education specialist, an evironmental specialist...and more all built into the cloning system!

      Just an official note: this campaign is in every way unofficial and is not sponsored or paid for by anyone.   The Bina & Clones for President(s) campaign seeks to bring new meaning to the term "multi-tasking." Our country will finally be equally served on all fronts by a cooperative group of politicians - our president! Not only able to give commencement speeches, be at a UN meeting, and raise a family all at once - our Bina and Clones President will also be able to make so many public appearances it will make the paparazzi dizzy!  Each Clone identically agrees with and supports the policies made by the others. They are networked together and update on a regular basis via wireless modems so that they keep up to date on the work that they are each doing. Plus, the Clones will bring other clones into the cabinet. This will mean that there will be no understaffing and no need for interns. What a cost saving measure! Taxpayers of the US unite - pay one person and get the work of 4! Sounds like the average corporate or government structure doesnt it?  Bina and Clones is guaranteed to have a politcal platform of some sort. She is guarateed to be a snazzy dresser, a smart cookie, and to give Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen a run for their money as most popular look-alikes.  Get out and VOTE for Bina & Clones - when she takes over the world it  will  be a better place.

      What an interesting concept! Its like American Idol without a point - and skipping the talent part...which some people do anyways from what I hear. Its most interesting to see what the rest of the world thinks (arg people blonde and busty does NOT always mean a 10 is required...ick) and how long ago the person checked their tally - a true contemporary exercise in vanity. "Did I get my 10 yet?" And then there is the reverse as well, "Lets see how low this picture will get." Also I sense some of the pictures posted are to exact retribution and revenge...exes in a non photogenic moment, algebra teachers that gave you a C, your boss, your bosses daughter...etc. Then I also kind of feel bad sometimes giving low/honest scores. I think, "oh their fragile ego." And then I remind myself THEY put that picture up there most likely, and that they are inviting my opinion.   As the faces to rate go by, I would start seeing people who remind me of people I know....and I give them biased higher or lower marks depending on how much I liked the people they remind me of in the first place. Bad me! The military pics get an automatic low from me. The uniform thing just doesnt do a thing for me - and a gun in the pic is like an automatic -10. Armpit hair visible regardless of gender will also scare me deeply. Any underwear shots (ack) will also make me skip the pics.... I think I am harsher on "typical" beauties, and "standard" handsomes...I have a thing for geeks after all...Take one look at my hubby and you will know its true. Ah yes, I know some of you havent yet even seen a picture of him. I will rectify this when a) i get a digital camera and b) we moved to morgantown. my husband is direly afraid that this blog will get discovered by someone who knows someone who knows someone he works with and it will spill the beans about our move and somehow end up fired or something. soooooooooo i will keep his anonymity (also explaining my anonymity as well...psuedonyms and what not...) for now at least we shall remain nameless and faceless. There are no pics of me - actually none taken within two years are in existence...plus, as of yet for I would rather send in a picture taken 8 -10 months from now. I am in my hamster wheel of weight loss.  I am also harsher on the girls than the guys...and by far harder on people who have a stupefied facial expression or are wielding a bottle. Beer featuring pictures doth not a hottie make.  There is that little somewhat vain voice in my head that wants to submit an old picture of me to hotornot.com....but then i think "oh but that will just be more affirmation that I once was hot and now am not"...i dont need that kind of reinforcement. Besides...what if I get rated a 4 or 3 or something...oh my fragile ego! Ha! Ironies will never cease.   There are some pretty skanky shots out there at hotornot.com...and shameless photos with kittens, puppies, babies, cleavage, posh cars, etc. in order to score higher points. And it makes me wonder does that cat really care if its "hot"? I would ask my resident expert but he's snoozing on the futon flicking his tail occassionally in his kitty dreams. I wake the kitty only if i feel like living dangerously.  Then there are the people you dont want to vote as hot but must...the "dude" with the IRA tatoo and holding a baby. We have shameless babyness, shameless bad boyness, and also blonde highlighted spikey hair, and potential armpit hair peekage...way overdone style. But in spite of all this he is still hot somehow. Then there is a girl who is in a prom shot that is in the black and white posh (not fashion) style...very posed, very primped, and reletively vacant looking...but even so she is undeniably hot. Not being blonde worked in her favor in this case. And what about the people who have obviously take their pic for the hotornot.com. If its quite clear that this is not some preexisting photo - thumbs down from me. And then once in a while you will come across a webcam shot so sincere and unposed...and authentic...not smiling...just viewing cyberspace as it were...and wondering "will this make me look hot?" Once in a great many photos I found some of this category.   I also had my first day of day camp training today. Some familiar faces, and many new faces too. Alot more counselors in general than last year. Some people I was glad to see, and one or two that I thought to myself, "did he/she HAVE to come back?" I know, I am a rotten person. And yes, I am still holding a spongebobsquarepants grudge over one counselor from last summer...who just generally annoys me to death no matter what anyways...  People were like, "Oh we didnt recognize you with your hair cut!" And I was sitting there thinking, "Yeah right admit it you didnt recognize me because of the extra 20-40 lbs." They werent fooling me. I know I look different. I know I say the same thing to people when they have gained weight. Ah well. Its a world of somewhat painful, somewhat dishonest, and relatively transparent politeness. Which brings this blog full circle to hotornot.com.  There are some pictures of folks that either a) are getting sympathy votes, b) are voting for themselves for hours on end, or c) have to be a joke or something. I mean I am not exclusively talking about the appearance of the person...there is also the quality of the picture to consider...the distance of the photo...and whether or not the friend the person may have posed with is hotter than they are. Hello, if you are 20 feet from the camera, blurred, and in 35 dpi or something how in the hell am I supposed to rate anything other than a 1? *tries to shake a couple pictures in particular from my brain* Hot or Not? Why would anyone care what a worldfull of perfect strangers thinks? Then again, I am sure that if I click through the photos long enough I will see someone I know.  here's to post political correctness era manners...  all the news in fits of print -  mack  ps. www.sluggy.com !!!! you will have some catch-up reading to do but there is a new viewers guide for all of the new sluggite converters. not that its a cult or anything. but any comic with demoic kittens called "the evil" is worth browse.    pps mystery rummy update: i kicked ass this evening. hehehe my revenge is exacted a little for totally getting skunked last night. whee!

Without waiting, and although I have been working on this for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks...GAH!!!!!!  That and the fact that when we deposit to the bank before 2PM and our debit card doesnt register it!!!!!!!!!!!! Grrrrr. Instant everything anymore but banking cant keep up. Financial aid cant keep up....we could buy stock in 10 minutes but the bank couldnt keep up!!!! The billing office can charge my account the right amount...but the FA office cant be bothered!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *Pant pant pant* Allrighty...venting hath happened.  over and out for now --mack

      Having ventured to Hollywood Video and paid a small late fee, we rented some DVD's. One of which was "The Triplettes of Belleville." This 80 odd minute animated romp was very entertaining. It has minimal dialogue, and this makes it have the feeling of a short that grew legs. The comedy is consistant and very enjoyable, the plot has its bizarre and enjoyable quirks, and there are stereotypes present that play out very well. There are several unique characters in the movie - not the least of which being the title triplettes. I have never seen such creative use of World War 1 grenades, nor heard such thoroughly enjoyable abstract music. Actually, I take that back. There was a man who married a dancer from OU *tries to remember either of their names* and he produced this piece of music using a typewriter hitting the Q key only. Very interesting and rhythmic. The triplettes would have loved it. Anywho, I like the fact that none of the characters are perfect in this feature, and that the main characters are all "old biddies" - none of which I would want to meet in a dark alley :) Old biddies will someday be ruling this planet - mark my words.   Throughout this movie common household items and common occurrences take on extraordianry meaning. Everything from a bicycle to a refridgerator or vacuum are almost worshipped for their various uses. And sometimes not used in their ordinary ways. The passing of trains seems to give meaning to the canine character, and french cultural references in themselves seem to take on a greater meaning as well. The dog, Bruno, has some great dream sequences which I really thought were well done. They were abstract, well visualized, and perhaps most remarkably in black and white - an eye for detail that was perfect. So we have a sleuth case with an old lady solving it - but this is no Murder She Wrote.  No no no, far too abstract for Angela Lansbury and far too French for any British Biddy Sleuther. Ah, French. The music, the artwork, the mood, the almost philosophical reinforcement of day to day life as consistant and habitual and filled with individual obsessions. The surrounding characters and artwork were at times more or less characactures of French imagery stereotypes. The mafia men were all great play with stereotypes - from the wine slooshing to the red noses and berets. It was done perfectly. The animation artwork in itself was very French...that certain 2D style applied to 3D work - reminding me of many things...Lyle Lyle Crocodile, the Aristocats, a set for a version of Tartuffe I very much enjoyed that played at OU..not to say that the animation was in anyway flat...oh no! Rather, it was classic.  There was one great moment of irony that I just have to mention before telling you to GO RENT IT...During one scene/interlude the triplettes are going to bed for the night and they are watching TV...They are animations watching a live action comedy on TV. I thought that was so funny and enjoyably ironic. The only part I did not enjoy of the entire movie was a certain lack of poetic justice for a certain frog. But ceste la vie. Ceste la cine de francais.  Before the movie we prepared dinner for my mother in law as a belated mothers day gift. It went well and all was enjoyed immensely. Which is a good thing.  After the movie we were semi bored and whipped out this card game we have had for ages and never played. It is a version of Mystery Rummy - Dr. Jekkyl and Mr. Hyde. Now the Jack the Ripper set was alot of fun so we ordered the other two versions that were out at the time (the third set being Murder at the Rue Morgue.) However, these other two versions were set up very differently and they just never quite caught our attention to play them. Well that changed tonight. My husband kicked my butt royally as we played four or so hands of the Mystery Rummy game. Needless to say, we had to work out some kinks of rules we had missed and cards we didnt read closely enough...but I would say tomorrow I shall exact my rummy revenge.  Another Sunday gone. I dont like Sundays in general - of course they are alot nicer if you sleep halfway through them like I did today. It helps them go quicker.  We also added the rabies shot tag to Henry's collar. This means he jingles adorably now as he trots through the basement, or scratches, or shakes his head in befuddlement of the jingling noise that now seems to be haunting him. Poor kitty. He has an ID tube that will go on his collar once we receive it - that will add to the jingling, but hopefully he will be ignoring the sound by the time the order gets here...Most impressively he allowed me to take off and put back on the collar with no incident whatsoever. There was no "run away while shes got the collar off!! ha ha she will never get that contraption back on me now" moment. He watched with some curiosity as I attached a red heart shape rabies vaccine tag that we got at the vets this past Friday, and then let me put his collar right back on him. Sometimes I wonder if our cat is stupid or civilized. I really cant tell.  --Mack

      Okay, I will write some more - I am happy to fulfill the requests of my two avid blog readers.  Last night, I went and saw "Troy" as treated to the flick by my mom and her husband. I think I am officially out of the post-mom's day doghouse. My mother managed not to corner me or pin me or be mean to me in any way...although she did try to wrangle my husband and I into working at her orchard.   "Troy" was not abominable in my opinion - although my fellow movie viewers thought so. It wasnt Oscar worthy by any stretch of the imagination and my husband put it best when he called it "A very expensive made for TV movie."   First some plot issues. They hit us over the head with the "story that will be told for centuries "per Achilles ego...a bit too much and a bit too hard. The parallels of relationships (Helen and Parris vs. Briseis and Achilles) were done a little too obviously. It was a bit painful at times...yes yes the audience understood the love that crosses cultures concept. One burning question my husband had...where did Cassandra go? She was apparently simply left out of this story. There were some story lines and moments that developed too quickly...and some that were over played and dragged out a bit too much. One element that wasnt hit on enough was the character of Odyseus. At the end of the movie my mother was like, "Oh he was Odyseus (played by Sean Bean aka: Boromir in Lord of the Rings I)...as in The Illiad and The Odyssey"....Hmmm and the whole movie was based on the Illiad - somehow I dont think that that was made clear. Plus, at the beginning it was very hard to keep track of people and places and the concepts of the story. They should have taken a little longer to clarify - it left my mom and her hubby in the dust and me wanting to see it again just to get it all straight. Thus the plot issues aspects of this review.  Next: Technical Filming issues. UG - The transistions an editting were terrible. From dark scenes to brighte middle of the day scenes then back again with no imbetween - leaving the audience wincing as their eyes were forced to adjust. There were toooooo many sweeping shots of ships, soldiers, architecture, soldiers, landscape, soldiers, destruction, soldiers....It was like a little kid playing with a new toy...they just dont know when to quit. The crowd scenes were beyond overblown...and thus lacked any sense of realism. And the major complaint all around? Too many extreme close up shots. We were either panning the broad scenery or just toooooo close to the characters to understand the scene for most of the movie. It was off-putting...this CLose Up overdose combined with what felt like cheap lighting made my husbands "Big Budget Made for TV Movie" scenario seem likely. It will however, be a great movie for Jr. High and High School Students to get a grasp on the story of the Illiad - even if Homer is rolling over in his grave.  The costuming was nice- the coloration of their costumes I question. Blue? I thought purple was the dye of the day...but I am not a historian so it could be acurate. It just struck me, thats all. There were some minor makeup issues...Helen only seemed to be wearing bottom eyeliner on one of her eyes in some scenes....and Agamemnon's scarred cheek seemed to vary in its intensity from time to time.  None of the acting was outstanding per se, but the best performance was delivered by the woman who played Briseis. None of us could find her listed in the credits....but there you have it. She stole the movie for the most part. (NOTE: according to my friend a fellow film buff, this actress would be Rose Byrne)  Other notable moments and thoughts: Achilles' (Played by Brad Pitt who wasnt nearly dirty enough in this movie to be attactive in the least...) cousin Patricus scarily resembled the oldest Hanson brother. Can we say MMM Bop? At one point in the movie Achilles is outside the gates of Troy screaming for Hector (Played by an unrecognizable Eric Bana....he did fairly well all in all and not a speck of green) and it sounded like Achilles might be losing his voice as he called for Hector again and again. My thought? "Oh, so this is the Trojan hoarse?" Orlando Bloom (as Parris) did another stint with a bow and arrow in this flick, deja vu. He was much hotter as an elf. Peter O'Toole was impressive in his role as King Priam, as well as in the blueness of his eyes. Hector's wife was well-done representing the women of the world who don't want to lose their soldier husbands...and she looked familiar although we couldnt place her name. (by Saffron Burrows -thanks to the same film buff birdie mentioned above- who you may recall from Circle of Friends (Eve) and Enigma)  So it seems I have knocked "Troy" some hard blows. Why do I say it wasnt attrocious despite all of the negative elements? Its a historic epic/drama. To me this genre serves a different purpose than the average fantasy/epic/etc. It is to spark interest in the subject, inform about the story line, remind people of the existence of great works of literature and times in history. It is to breathe life into dead works. "Troy" did achieve these goals. It could have been done better. The casting was amazing...and obviously there was alot of interest in the film and making the work. Its just a shame that the director seems to have been a techno-phile and let his cinematographer do his work for him.  I still didnt squirm through this movie...although I wasnt wrapped up in it...I think it had great potential...that was just not realized. Some things to laud about the movie: the Greeks and Trojans relationship and belief in the Gods was well handled. They were devout and doubting and believers and too trusting each in their own measures. The importance of the Gods in the lives of the people of that time was, I feel, well portrayed. To the people/characters written about in the Illiad and Odyssey the gods were real. The monsters were real. The world was a more fantastic place...so to the characters in this movie...the same held true. Although - I must note...for all of the talk of the Gods there was not a single sighting of them or usage of them in the movie as characters themselves. That might have been an interesting subplot. Ajax was a cool character to get a glance of with his great hammer of war :) The character of Parris was handled very well...a boy in love, growing up, showing cowardice, having a "great victory" against a great warrior (via arrows in the movie) and there is no one there to see him triumph.  The last burning question? Will there be a sequal? If there is (the Odyssey still remains to be re-told) I would like to see it. Even if it carries similar flaws. I had trouble with Mythology in school - I couldnt keep the people/charachters/gods/and stories straight. Seeing this style of movie is clarifying alot of what I only half grasped in high school and junior high - and is much more edifying and interesting than the dull claymation versions I was subjected to in my youth.  Edna Hamilton (see your high school Mythology primer if you want to know who Edna is) be damned, and Homer dust off your coffin - Mythology may yet have a come back.  --Mack

      Triple Feature. Friday was payday...all around. The rest of my Summer Session I Financial Aid, Bear got paid, I GOT PAID!!!! (Woot $28.00 being my first check of the summer...) and we splurged just a wee bit. Wee bit. Triple feature paycheck = triple feature movie!!!!  We went and saw a Matinee of "Day After Tomorrow." I really wanted to see it and dragged my husband (can we say "role reversal" I thought we could...) It was the best "end of the world/disaster" movie yet. I guess I should invent a ratings system...but I dont know how to do that and still keep the genre in mind. I dont see how I can rate movies from different genres against each other...I would naturally rate favorite genres higher thus...missing the point really. I will try to rate the movies within their "class" to help people get a better perspective of a flick. Thus comparing to other similar movies.  The good: The plot/story line. No one tried to stop the natural occurences (no missles or nuclear warheads put into a storm or military rescue mission against all odds ala "Independence Day", "Deep Impact" or any of those other corny ass movies. Nature was not to be conquored, it was to be survived. Jake Gyllanhall (sp?) - need I say more? And it left me chattering in my seat...which means that it was good/real enough to encompass me in the world of the movie and thus feel several degrees colder. Its the most likely scenario type for "the end of the known world" and I think a good job was done representing Meterologists as cool people we ought to know, and the government that gets choked up on its own bueracracy and causes more problems before it solves an issue. Yep. Good work. Oh and no overblown heroic/tragic soundtrack. What a relief.   The Bad: Eh, well the time scale seemed a little forced...but it did have to fit into a two hour movie...and the pressure had to stay on in order to keep the "edge of your seat" effect cranked. It made several people in the audience have to pee. It dealt with the typical divorced family further split by disaster and their togetherness and importance blah blah blah. Not even 5 natural disasters could bring my family back together - although it might be interesting to see the weather try. Some production inconsistancies...the very important little red line drawn on a map for evacuation moves from one shot to the next...about 400 miles north...I know they must have used more than one dog to represent the Border Collie pet dog and the markings are distinguishably different, and why not burn Niche? He believe in the nothingness of our world and would be proud to have his book burned as the annihilation (think: nihilist) of the known world was occuring.  The Ugly: Some plot strings left loose. The boy with cancer? What happens to him in the end? Suprisingly the audience cares. Going back for survivors is all well and good, and it makes sense that there would be some. But did they go back to any city other than NYC? What became of LA? The West Coast mysteriously ceased to exist after the opening sequences. And although I really liked the space station perspective added in...why was it that they were always staring out the window for quite a while before they commented? It was like scene: pause...pause pause..."Look at this!" All the cosmo/astronaust did was stare out the window apparently... and we didnt need the dramatic pauses. Oh and what did the rest of the world do? We got international perspectives up until the solution/coping phase of the movie. Then nada. So where did all the Russians go? Or are we to assume the rest of the world died and only "Americans" will lead the world forward from the Southern Hemisphere. Most important plot drop: the Scottish Weather Station personnel. We understand that they are doomed...but we never really see what happens.  Still, for a disaster/end of the world movie and summer popcorn flick - I recommend seeing it. Its not oscar worthy (other than maybe for computer icicle effects and whatnot...) but its still worth a matinee at least.  Ack...Bear is home an hour early from work!!! Blogging time to be...cut short...drastically...(think Captain Kirk)  My husband and I also went last night to a Drive In double feature. Drive in theatres are rare any more, and it was a nice treat. We saw "Hellboy" and "13 going on 30" Both of which I enjoyed for different reasons. And was worth the $3.50 per flick.   Hellboy isnt the top of the best comic book movies of all time by any stretch (This List Being: The First Batman, the original Superman movie, Spiderman I, Dick Tracy, and XMen I and II...) But it does rank slightly above "Daredevil" in my book and somewhat better than the "Hulk" far better than "Spawn". Within its genre it falls right after the bastions of the comic book genre...and some of their sequels. Somewhere right after Batman III (which is ranked above Batman II in my book - I am sucker for Poison Ivy and still waiting for Harley Quinn) and before Superman III.  "Hellboy" is one of the few comic book based movies that recognize the character as being from a comic book within the movie. I have to give props for working this into the plot effectively. Some great momemts: spying from the top of a building eating milk and cookies with a random kid, horn moments, the pervasive human-ness of this demon character and his love for cats, rescueing kittens moment, and actually some decent one liners for a change. James Bond take note. Fish guy character - loved him!!! Where's his spin-off??? Bonus for Selma Blair...although she didnt put alot of effort into the underused role she was still the coolest "fire starter" since Drew Barrymore. Ron Perlman did a great rendition of the demon monkey himself...and deserves more credit than he got in the critics circles.  Downsides? Somewhat obscure character that didnt generate large box offices. Overuse of computer graphics (and lack of quality in such graphics according to my hubby) Everyone knows the Nazis were bad...we didnt need more proof. And most of the audience has no clue really who or what Rasputin really was...other than seeing Anastasia. So the roots of the comic are set deeply in history that is mostly obscured and unknown to the contemporary audience. Eh, and I had a little trouble with the opening scenes and their anachronisms in technology and concept. If a gateway to hell was opened during WWII I dont think it would look like something from "Contact."  Right oh then, still an engaging and entertaining Comic Book romp with lots of closeups of red pecs. I recommend rental or second run since its out of the theatres mostly now. See it some night when you are doing a comic book double feature.   13 going on 30...I enjoyed immensly and made me wish ZoZo and NicNic were with me! (Even if ZoZo is 14 now...) *sniff sniff* It was funny and well done...and full of imperfect characters to varying levels. I like the concept of a life gone wrong...when you dont even remember what it was that you did...and what to do now? Good: Jennifer Garner's performance as a 13 year old stuck in a 30 year old body, some nice touches and visual gag moments. The 80's flashbacks were fun...but does anyone know what Razzle is? Somewhat original story line (See "Big") and in the first version of the wished for grown up life...things dont all work out. Love that. And TomTom (Lucy) is the kind of girl we all love to hate. The thirteen year old sleepover...great conceptual moment. Loved that.  Bad: The ending was more than unclear. I dont want to ruin the ending but I was left wondering what happened really? Did she zoom back to 30 as a jump from 13 or are we to assume that she lived her life in a milisecond to get to the last scene? Hmmm. It raises some serious plot questions... The Poise magazine editor in chief put in a dismal performance. Rowan Atkinson would have done better...and I really dont like Rowan Atkinson. Perfect casting choice? Rupert Everett. ("My Best Friend's Wedding" - played part of Julia Robert's gay friend...not to caddycorner or typecast him as gay...as that was really barely touched on or indicated in 13 going on 30...) He would have done a much better job. So would have Mr. Bean. And thats saying something.  The Ugly: That green/rainbow dress. Ick. Her general fashion experiments were kind of scary. Even scarier than an 80's 13 year old would have chosen. Plus 1987 was not really (to my memory) what they portraid it as. I was in 5th grade in 1987 and remember it well...We had moved past most of the hideousness of the eighties and were starting to blend into the pastel hideous era of the 90's. Music had started to revert to R&B blech...and the golden years of the eighties...ala Thriller would have been old news...and uncool to the kids of 1987...Michael Jackson was already a has-been. They played out the 80's as 1984...which was the quintessential 80's year...) not 1987 per her age requirements.  Still a good flick...catch a matinee if its still in the theatres...and dont forget the popcorn and for the hell of it - its the perfect movie to dress up for...as in dress like you are from the 80's. Oh, and retro as cool...hadnt been born yet in 1987...so Jenna would have no concept of something being so retro that it would be cool. Just a note.  Allrighty theres the triple feature. One note: my hubby wants to see a "Hellboy" and "Passion of the Christ" double feature. What will happen to the world if he ever owns his own movie theatre? Ack!  Likely to have another triple feature next weekend with Harry Potter, and more Drive In goodness with Van Helsing and Connie and Carla. Woot! Oh, and the Drive In food is good, bathrooms clean, mosquitoes werent bad, it was a little chilly, and there were some pretty annoying teenagers present. But all in all the Jungle Drive In just needs some marketing badly.  Pembroke Welsh COrgi...we have decided to expand our potential dog breed interests. There are alot of reasons a beagle isnt a great apartment dog...and I have a sense that we need to make dog ownership as simple as possible. I first "met" the Corgi as a breed in the anime series "Cowboy Beebop" which is completely awesome and requires no level of anime geekness to enjoy. WATCH IT!!!! Great Blues music featured as well. "Ein" is a cool character and although I dont think any corgi we get will be able to hack computers...its still a cool dog. :) There are rescues for adult corgis and corgis are represented in shelters in our area...and there are West Virginia and close Ohio breeders as well. When it gets closer to the time when we can have a dog...I think I will have ample contacts. Its important to get a dog that will blend with your lifestyle and living arrangements. Corgis seem flexible and apt city living dogs... I will post a piccy of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. My Welsh travelling friends might be more familiar with them...  NO BOOTY BLOGGED HERE.  I did discover car sales on EBay...and when August comes upon us and my BIG financial aid payment is here...it may be a potential source for a new run around car for me...Nothing fancy..but the cars are newer and less expensive...(I found a 93 Mercedes for $1950 - $1000 less than what the local guy wants for a 83 Mercedes...sheesh!) and its in EBays best interest to offer some buyer and seller protection - and many of the sellers are dealerships! Roadtrip anyone? Right well then, I wont get hooked on EBay for another couple of months yet...And I will still peruse the local shops...I wont give up on finding a good car in my own backyard.  Going to my mother's tonight...ug. She has baited me with the promise of my cousins who are too cute and cool to resist. Tomorrow will be family day with the inlaws...and then who knows what after. More news to come after I survive all of this mess. THings are getting less happy with my mother in law...although she doesnt know it...I am getting less and less pleased with her in general. What is it with me and moms?  But there you have it for now...All the News in Fits of Print. And then some. --Mack

      Sorry to be getting behind again my two or three avid readers :P Things have just been super hectic. My first homework deadline was yesterday (met with grace and speed) and it seems that we were just running around ALL DAY yesterday. We went grocery shoppping with the Bear In-Laws over across the river in Ohio. Giant Eagle beckoned and we regressed. There we were sneaking items into the shopping cart while no one was looking. *sneak sneak* Just like little kids. When the cart was getting unloaded it was a chant of "it was on sale," or "we really need that," or "you have to try this - you will love it!" Sad but true. My husbands mom was glad to have extra hands to cover her giant grocery trip but might have wished we werent there to toss more into the carts.   We also both went the YMCA and worked out, and are doing so again today!!! Yay us. We desperately need the exercise to say the least. Especially me...  Today was a YMCA work/cleanup day. I spent the morning helping to assemble and arrange two computers in the Afterschool Room area with another counselor. And they say my hubby is the computer genius...I got the internet up and running and everything!  Bina - my gather-er of info extrordinairre has brought up to me the booty blogging that was going on from the perspective of an intern for the state of Ohio. Her alias was Washingtonienne or something along those lines...and she was fired for the contents of her blog. Note to self: DONT BLOG BOOTY. Especially if that booty involves government officials...  Ah, and another serious terrorist threat against the US. Who is to say we dont have it coming? Thanks to our useless invasions left and right and our human rights atrocities we have, in some ways, earned it. Now, mind you the average joe in the street doesnt deserve to be attacked by a terrorist (except maybe because they didnt vote 4 years ago!!!) But seriously - no "innocents" deserve to die for the poor leadership of our country. On the other hand, our country has been killing innocents in the name of misguided military campaigns for a couple years now...Afghanistan/Iraq...and really I dont consider that much different than terrorists. Just because our military is funded by our government, and led by our government who have their own agenda regardless of the voters wishes...oh wait, how is that not terrorism???  Oh my, I have to go for now. The limitations of owning one vehicle in a non walking and non biking friendly town with no true public transportation is very frustrating.  --Mack

      It might just be my computer or it might be some other unknown evil. Bear (who is much more bare sans long-ass hair that had managed to grow and sprawl from all angles on his head...) spent two hours this afternoon...resetting, rebooting, calling the cable company, and generally cussing out and messing with my computer. To some avail...but its not incredibly different. The internet moves at a snails pace on this thing for some reason. All day monday and tuesday up until my computer was over hauled i could barely get a page to load. It was very frustrating what with homework deadlines upon me and whatnot.  My husband (see above) got his hair cut Monday...it was quite a relief. It was longer than mine is now!!!! It was a frizzy mess on his head and it looks soooooooo much better now. Trust me.  I will try to continue to wrangle with my cpu and keep posting. Hopefully some permanent solution (other than throwing my laptop out the basement window) will become self-evident.  All the news in fits of print... Mack

I think the tree was lost in a storm and they hacked off the top evenly to be rid of the broken top. From there the artisan must have used lumberjack equipment or something and climbed to the top to carve this eagle. I always wonder if he knows what he is going to carve, or if he just lets it come out of the woodwork...so to speak.&nbsp; urlLink

      An unofficial reprint of an article: It is amazing what the US press doesnt print. This article was forwarded to me by my biological dad...quite the radical in his own right. But I thought it was of enough import to share here.  The Other Prisoners   By Luke Harding   The Guardian U.K.    Thursday 20 May 2004  Most of the coverage of abuse at Abu Ghraib has focused on male detainees. But what of the five women held in the jail, and the scores elsewhere in Iraq?    The scandal at Abu Ghraib prison was first exposed not by a digital photograph but by a letter. In December 2003, a woman prisoner inside the jail west of Baghdad managed to smuggle out a note. Its contents were so shocking that, at first, Amal Kadham Swadi and the other Iraqi women lawyers who had been trying to gain access to the US jail found them hard to believe.     The note claimed that US guards had been raping women detainees, who were, and are, in a small minority at Abu Ghraib. Several of the women were now pregnant, it added. The women had been forced to strip naked in front of men, it said. The note urged the Iraqi resistance to bomb the jail to spare the women further shame.     Late last year, Swadi, one of seven female lawyers now representing women detainees in Abu Ghraib, began to piece together a picture of systemic abuse and torture perpetrated by US guards against Iraqi women held in detention without charge. This was not only true of Abu Ghraib, she discovered, but was, as she put it, "happening all across Iraq".     In November last year, Swadi visited a woman detainee at a US military base at al-Kharkh, a former police compound in Baghdad. "She was the only woman who would talk about her case. She was crying. She told us she had been raped," Swadi says. "Several American soldiers had raped her. She had tried to fight them off and they had hurt her arm. She showed us the stitches. She told us, 'We have daughters and husbands. For God's sake don't tell anyone about this.'"     Astonishingly, the secret inquiry launched by the US military in January, headed by Major General Antonio Taguba, has confirmed that the letter smuggled out of Abu Ghraib by a woman known only as "Noor" was entirely and devastatingly accurate. While most of the focus since the scandal broke three weeks ago has been on the abuse of men, and on their sexual humilation in front of US women soldiers, there is now incontrovertible proof that women detainees - who form a small but unknown proportion of the 40,000 people in US custody since last year's invasion - have also been abused. Nobody appears to know how many. But among the 1,800 digital photographs taken by US guards inside Abu Ghraib there are, according to Taguba's report, images of a US military policeman "having sex" with an Iraqi woman.     Taguba discovered that guards have also videotaped and photographed naked female detainees. The Bush administration has refused to release other photographs of Iraqi women forced at gunpoint to bare their breasts (although it has shown them to Congress) - ostensibly to prevent attacks on US soldiers in Iraq, but in reality, one suspects, to prevent further domestic embarrassment.     Earlier this month it emerged that an Iraqi woman in her 70s had been harnessed and ridden like a donkey at Abu Ghraib and another coalition detention centre after being arrested last July. Labour MP Ann Clwyd, who investigated the case and found it to be true, said, "She was held for about six weeks without charge. During that time she was insulted and told she was a donkey."     In Iraq, the existence of photographs of women detainees being abused has provoked revulsion and outrage, but little surprise. Some of the women involved may since have disappeared, according to human rights activists. Professor Huda Shaker al-Nuaimi, a political scientist at Baghdad University who is researching the subject for Amnesty International, says she thinks "Noor" is now dead. "We believe she was raped and that she was pregnant by a US guard. After her release from Abu Ghraib, I went to her house. The neighbours said her family had moved away. I believe she has been killed."     Honour killings are not unusual in Islamic society, where rape is often equated with shame and where the stigma of being raped by an American soldier would, according to one Islamic cleric, be "unbearable". The prospects for rape victims in Iraq are grave; it is hardly surprising that no women have so far come forward to talk about their experiences in US-run jails where abuse was rife until early January.     One of the most depressing aspects of the saga is that, unaccountably, the US military continues to hold five women in solitary confinement at Abu Ghraib, in cells 2.5m (8ft) long by 1.5m (5ft) wide. Last week, the military escorted a small group of journalists around the camp, where hundreds of relatives gather every day in a dusty car park in the hope of news.     The prison is protected by guard towers, an outer fence topped with razor wire, and blast walls. Inside, more than 3,000 Iraqi men are kept in vast open courtyards, in communal brown tents exposed to dust and sun. (Last month, nearly 30 detainees were killed in two separate mortar attacks on the prison; about a dozen survivors are still in the hospital wing, shackled to their beds with leather belts.) As our bus pulled up, the men ran towards the razor wire. They unfurled banners and T-shirts that read: "Why are we here?" "When are you going to do something about this scandal?" "We cannot talk freely."     The women, however, are kept in another part of the prison, cellblock 1A, together with 19 "high-value" male detainees. It is inside this olive-painted block, which leads into a courtyard of shimmering green saysaban trees and pink flowering shrubs, that the notorious photographs of US troops humiliating Iraqi prisoners were taken, many of them on the same day, November 8, 2003. A wooden interrogation shed is a short stroll away. As we arrived at the cellblock, the women shouted to us through the bars. An Iraqi journalist tried to talk to them; a female US soldier interrupted and pushed him away. The windows of the women's cells have been boarded up; birds nest in the outside drainpipe. Captain Dave Quantock, now in charge of prisoner detention at Abu Ghraib, confirmed that the women prisoners are in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. They have no entertainment; they do have a Koran.     Since the scandal first emerged there is general agreement that conditions at Abu Ghraib have improved. A new, superior catering company now provides the inmates' food, and all the guards involved in the original allegations of abuse have left.     Nevertheless, there remain extremely troubling questions as to why these women came to be here. Like other Iraqi prisoners, all five are classified as "security detainees" - a term invented by the Bush administration to justify the indefinite detention of prisoners without charge or legal access, as part of the war on terror. US military officials will only say that they are suspected of "anti-coalition activities".     Two of the women are the wives of high-ranking and absconding Ba'ath party members; two are accused of financing the resistance; and one allegedly had a relationship with the former head of Iraq's secret police, the Mukhabarat. The women, in their 40s and 50s, come from Kirkuk and Baghdad; none has seen their families or children since their arrest earlier this year.     According to Swadi, who managed to visit Abu Ghraib in late March, the allegations against the women are "absurd". "One of them is supposed to be the mistress of the former director of the Mukhabarat. In fact, she's a widow who used to own a small shop. She also worked as a taxi driver, ferrying children to and from kindergarten. If she really had a relationship with the director of the Mukhabarat, she would scarcely be running a kiosk. These are baseless charges," she adds angrily. "She is the only person who can provide for her children."     The women appear to have been arrested in violation of international law - not because of anything they have done, but merely because of who they are married to, and their potential intelligence value. US officials have previously acknowledged detaining Iraqi women in the hope of convincing male relatives to provide information; when US soldiers raid a house and fail to find a male suspect, they will frequently take away his wife or daughter instead.     The International Committee of the Red Cross, whose devastating report on human rights abuses of Iraqi prisoners was delivered to the government in February but failed to ring alarm bells, says the problem lies with the system. "It is an absence of judicial guarantees," says Nada Doumani, spokesperson for the ICRC. "The system is not fair, precise or properly defined."     During her visit to Abu Ghraib in March, one of the prisoners told Swadi that she had been forced to undress in front of US soldiers. "The Iraqi translator turned his head in embarrassment," she said. The release of detainees, meanwhile, appears to be entirely arbitrary: three weeks ago one woman prisoner who spoke fluent English and who had been telling her guards that she would sue them was suddenly released. "They got fed up with her," another lawyer, Amal Alrawi, says.     Last Friday, about 300 male prisoners were freed from Abu Ghraib, the first detainees to be released since the abuse scandal first broke. A further 475 are due to be released tomorrow, although it is not clear if any of the women will be among them. General Geoffery Miller, who is responsible for overhauling US military jails in Iraq, has promised to release 1,800 prisoners across Iraq "within 45 days". Some 2,000 are likely to remain behind bars, he says. Iraqi lawyers and officials aredemanding that the US military hands the prisons over to Iraqi management on June 30, when the coalition transfers limited powers to a UN-appointed caretaker Iraqi government. Last week, Miller said "negotiations" with Iraqi officials were ongoing.     Relatives who gathered outside Abu Ghraib last Friday said it was common knowledge that women had been abused inside the jail. Hamid Abdul Hussein, 40, who was there hoping to see his brother Jabar freed, said former detainees who had returned to their home town of Mamudiya reported that several women had been raped. "We've know this for months," he said. "We also heard that some women committed suicide."     While the abuse may have stopped, the US military appears to have learned nothing from the experience. Swadi says that when she last tried to visit the women at Abu Ghraib, "The US guards refused to let us in. When we complained, they threatened to arrest us."

      Welcome to Monday. It is a day of rebooting. We all get ourselves back into gear for the ordinary work week. If only such a thing existed.  Angels in America. Saturday Night: My husband who wishes that should being calling him SOMETHING other than my hubby and shall henceforth be known as Bear...anywho we sat down and watched a tape of HBO's version of "Angels in America Part I." (See past blog for photo of a play production that I was involved in at OU in 2000.) It was awesome. It was at times also as if Tony Kushner (the author/playwright/screenwrighter) might have sneeked into our performance of the play. So many similarities. Then I remembered that Vince Cardinal (the director of our version) saw the original Broadway "Angels..." but I also remembered that I sat in on every moment of rehearsal for that play and that he let the actors determine their own actions to land with every line. He was not a heavy handed director. Well if the cast saw this version of Angels they should be pleased that their interpretations were so agreed with. Some of the HBO cast even LOOKED like the OU castmembers. Eeeerily so. Perhaps the script is just so well written that it doesnt leave room for alternate interpretations...and then I remembered going to OSU's production of "Angels in Americal Part II" in Columbus and what a terrible awful mess of a production that it was. Disgraceful really. The second part of the HBO series will surely do better by Kushner's work.  We also went and saw New York Minute yesterday as a Matinee....Hmmm...what to say. The best moment of the movie I dont want to ruin, but can I say Full House flashback! The soundtrack was good, the editting was well done, the director seemed to be slacking, and so did some of the actors aboard the cast. MK and Ash did a fine job...although I rememeber seeing an interview with them saying how their were each playing their opposite in real life...Ash playing the wild one and MK the reserved one....in reality this was not the case. And other than their costuming I still cant tell the non identical Olsens apart for the life of me. It was still enjoyable - not like the remake of the Time Machine where every moment was like there was less oxygen in the air...but it will not likely receive any oscars. What future does the careers of the soon to be 18 year old Olsen's hold? I say, produce produce produce. Design fashion...if it can be toned down a little...and well keep acting and singing I suppose but PLEASE dont hire the former Joe Dirt Director EVER again. The Olsens could have done better themselves. By the way - I cant help but wonder how Simple Plan and the Wakefields - two fairly well known and decently received punk bands...are keeping face having participated in the Olsen twin flick. Or will it soon be alt/punk to dig the twins?  Ah, we have almost mastered the digital camera we purchased. Many a photo we have taken at this point...moving, up close, far away...etc. Testing its very limits. We are really really happy with our Minolta Z2. I have even started to grasp the Manual controls as well.  Books: Just finised "Ella Minnow Pea" by Mark Dugan. A very funny book about what would happen if we were suddenly forbidden from using certain letters of the alphabet.It is a love of language and words that created "Ella..." and its a quick fun read for anyone. If my county library had the book there is no excuse for anyone not to be able to find it! I also finished two mysteries by Patricia Carlon - an Australian writer from the 60's. Either book would make a GREAT movie. "Hush, it's a Game" and "Crime of Silence." I would love to produce either. If only I had the money and the film rights. Someone will make a million or 10 on my suggestion/idea to turn them into films someday. Mark my words.  Today is still Monday it seems. Homework to do. Cat to cuddle. Cleaning to accomplish. YMCA training starting again tonight.  All the news in fits of print... Mack

      So let’s start with the orchard. I am now I think officially in charge-ish of producing my mom’s marketing and advertising for the orchard.  This means that at the moment I am making labels for her apple cider that starts production this year. Good times to be had by all. Label making is a little frustrating. Space is extraordinarily limited, there is a lot of info to put on it, and my mother’s logo is 4 colors and she doesn’t want to pay for 4 color printing. Fun fun.  I recall a conversation a few years ago where I mentioned limiting the number of colors in one’s logo due to cost of printing and general expense as the logo will be on EVERYTHING. *sigh* I will work around it.  I shall be working weekends at my mom's orchard this fall doing a bit of the retail biz to sell apples. I signed up. I volunteered. Its extra money, and since we are saving for our big move I shouldnt say no to extra money.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: the third in the Harry Potter Sequence. Starring the usual bunch with the additions of Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, and a lot more minority wizarding students.   The Good: It was darker…more grown up in some ways…just just generally looked more real and less overly bright surreal.  I liked getting to see the kids in their “weekend” ordinary clothes. Nice touch. The whomping willow moments were hilarious for the most part, and nice little transitional pieces. In fact all of the nature oriented transistions were amazing. Hermione socking Malfoy in the schnoz was good enough to see twice. The time concept of certain events in the movie was done very well…I had forgotten about the whole time deal actually and it was cool to see it unexpectedly. Its been a while since I have read the third book.  The comedy is still present and well timed. My hubby enjoyed the Hypogryph quite a lot, and the closing credits were pretty cool – if not seeming as if they may have spent way too long on them. The lighting was good and the Dementors were sure as hell scary. The new Dumbledore is much more mischievious such as he is written in the books – a great improvement over the way too mellow and no fun Dumbledore. Dumbledore also seemed more involved or connected with the story this time…even though he was not necessarily in it more. I think his playfulness ties him more to Harry and the story line. Thank god they changed Malfoy’s hairstyle. It managed to look slightly less fake in this movie.  The Bad: The transitions between ordinary interior scenes, and between some overall moments in the story line were terrible. There was at times no relationship created between the two scenes being linked, so there was just a complete lack of transition. The fading in and out of black felt way over televisionish, and hindered the momentum of the movie.   Malfoy seems to have undergone a supreme character change/direction change. I don’t recall him being a character that I would expect to snivel or scamper away…he would keep his cool but still look scared in his eyes. He lost his cool a few times in this movie. Ginny was barely mentioned…and if you didn’t read the books you didn’t know who she was. In fact my mom and her hubby were quite lost at some points in the movie – without reading the books they were puzzled. I don’t think that the movie makers should assume the audience has ALL read the books.  And while I appreciate Cuaron increasing the number of minority students that were shown attending Hogwarts it seems like he still missed some minorities. The Indian and Black people are well accounted for, with no Asians or Hispanics to be seen. Plus the minority kids seemed to be in the front of every scene - which while I enjoy the fact that he’s making an effort to more fairly represent everyone, it just seemed too intentional. When the audience notices such things it’s not usually a good thing. But to reiterate my point before anyone thinks I am racist or anything - I am glad the cast is becoming more balanced – it will help ease the International wizards into the storyline next time and includes more positive images/role models and characters for all children.  The Ugly: Professor Lupin’s moustache. ICK.  The Werewolf he turned into. ICK. Who was in charge of his character design? Can we fire them?   THE ENDING. Oh my god is it sudden, pointless, and with no resolution or sense that springtime has come or the school year is over AT ALL. So sloppy…and seems like there was a lot more to the movie, but they just cut it for time without considering whether the place they cut it at was an ending or not. They should be ashamed of it really.  The Bonus: A new director has been chosen for the next Harry Potter Movie. Mike Newell. I hear he’s a Brit. I hope he does a better job in the story telling department than Cuaron, and hires a new editing department while he's at it. I do hope he keeps the overall darker mood and look of Cuaron though - it works better for the world that the uber bright fake look. I hope they include more of the book in the movie than in this past movie. They could organize a Kill Bill set up and film 5 hours of footage and break it into two 2.5 hour movies shown 6 months apart. And then still start work on the book 5 movie as well.  The next book is monstrously long…something will have to be done. Take a page from Tarantino people!  Overall: I didn’t think that this movie was too scary for little kids – although maybe it would be too scary for my cousin... Although the Dementors are quite scary in their own right, the Ring Wraiths from Lord of the Rings were just as bad if not worse. I think any kid who could handle the spiders from the last movie can deal with the Dementors.  Harry’s temper is starting to show, as well as his pride and interest in his parents and the people they were. They did a good job of working these issues into the movie fairly seamlessly.  But although I am glad I saw the movie and wouldn’t have missed it no matter how bad it was I think it will be the ill-fated middle child of the Harry Potter series. I also thing that the editing and transitions along with the sudden ending will cause it to lose some of its overall take at the box office, and that by and far the audiences will not consider it one of their favorite in the series, when all is said and done.  That’s all the news for now… --Mack

      Bush, Kerry political ads can't handle the truth Voters in 30 states that are not expected to be closely contested in this year's presidential election are missing the onslaught of TV ads President Bush and Democratic challenger John Kerry are airing. They should consider themselves fortunate. Voters in the other so-called battleground states, where the election is likely to be decided, aren't as lucky. The two campaigns, armed with record funds, are bombarding voters with attacks on the rival candidate that are filled with exaggerations, omissions and misleading statements peddled as "facts."  While deceptive ads are hardly new to politics, what makes this year different is how early the barrage has begun and how often the commercials are running. And truth is the principal victim: One non-partisan study has found that most viewers believe the ads.  Political consultants may be convinced that campaigns that play loose with the facts win elections, but the country loses. Voters are deprived of a chance to weigh the real differences between candidates. And polls show that mudslinging campaigns persuade many to stay home rather than vote.  How each side has distorted facts:  Bush. His ads claim Kerry would raise taxes by at least $900 billion in his first 100 days, wants to repeal the anti-terrorist USA Patriot Act and has repeatedly voted against much-needed defense programs.  The facts: Kerry has no such tax plan. He has called for greater judicial supervision of investigations conducted under the Patriot Act, not the law's repeal. And the defense spending shifts Kerry backed had been sought by Vice President Cheney when he was Defense secretary under Bush's father.  Kerry. His ads charge that 3 million jobs have been lost during the Bush presidency and accuse Bush of saying that "sending jobs overseas makes sense." By contrast, the ads claim Kerry "cast a decisive vote that created 20 million new jobs" a decade ago.  The facts: At its worst, the drop in employment from 2001 through mid-2003 was 2.7 million. Recent gains put the net loss at 1.6 million through April. A White House economist, not Bush, said outsourcing jobs overseas lowers consumer prices; he did not say domestic job losses were a good thing. And Kerry's "decisive" vote was for a 1993 deficit-reduction bill, backed by nearly every Democrat, that certainly wasn't the sole cause of the economic boom that followed.  The claims in the ads are being closely monitored by news organizations and independent watchdogs such as Fact check.org, run by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.  The center's survey of 18 battleground states found that the ads are having their intended effect: The public is buying the false claims. Majorities believed that Bush "favors sending American jobs overseas," Kerry "voted for higher taxes 350 times" and 3 million jobs have been lost during Bush's presidency. A plurality agreed that "John Kerry wants to raise gasoline taxes by 50 cents a gallon," parroting the Bush campaign's recycling of a 10-year-old quote that Kerry has long since repudiated.  Bush and Kerry have sharply differing views on many issues, from taxes and trade to health care and the environment. Highlighting them honestly would allow voters to make informed choices. Stretching the truth only gives voters another reason to stay home on Election Day.

      Okay I am writing this blog in word to avoid the Internet Blog Muncher.  A quick recap (again): The Third Time is a Charm – right?  Miracle: the Disney flick about the 1980 US Hockey Team.  The Good: The Hockey… as a novice fan I really enjoyed the hockey. The feel of the film was right. It felt like the 80’s – and the current events were well organized and the background for the time period was just right. It looked like 1980 in the movie…which still looked like the 70’s really so they hit the nail on the head there. The technology was right and everything. Kurt Russel as a hockey coach - a new kind of role for him really…and he jumped into the plaid pants and ran with it.   The Bad: Disney missed out on a great soundtrack here. They could have done A LOT more with it. The portrayal of the Russian team was fairly one sided. The director missed out on a lot of chances to create more interesting and plot moving parallels between the two teams and coaches.  There is a hint of it in the final game…but not enough to actually achieve anything. The last game of the Olympics isn’t shown…the US team didn’t win the gold after beating the Ruskies…they had to go on for one more game and beat another team. This was a key element in the story…and I feel it should have been shown. At least more than just a blurb. And, the plot line was a little typical. I mean, how many “coach as pseudo father figure who rallies the players by challenging them” movies do we really need? Plus the role of supportive, somewhat neglected wife/mom who provides strength gets a little tiresome.  The Ugly: Kurt Russel’s suits. I mean they were the worst of the worst for the time period but that’s not really my complaint. He doesn’t wear them well. They all looked new on him…not well enough worn.  Some of the hair and mustaches in this movie may make you want to run away.  The volume. It is a loud movie. Loud as in lots of cheering, buzzers, and general ice hockey noise. This is not a movie to watch if you are sneaking around after curfew or someone else is sleeping nearby. There is a made for TV movie titled Miracle on Ice, another movie titled Do You Believe in Miracles, that were both made about the 1980 US Hockey team…a while ago. Hello lack of originality in subject matter.  Overall: Rent this movie! Rent it for fun. Rent it with a sports fan. Rent it to get into the Olympic spirit…rent it for a flavor of the world in 1980. You can even make a quadruple ice-sports movie feature: Miracle, The Mighty Ducks, The Cutting Edge, and Men with Brooms.  Bonus: check out this ice skating movie database for any movie that even slightly has something to do or a scene with ice skating in it…cool! http://www.eskatefans.com/movie/index.html  Bubba Ho-tep: a Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead series) movie about an Elvis impersonator and JFK impersonator living in a convalescent home who discover that their fellow residents are falling victim to a soul eating, cowboy looking, ancient Egyptian Mummy. Yeah. This was one of my hubby’s choices.   The Good: Ossie Davis does extremely well as a black man convinced that he’s JFK dyed brown after the shooting to hide him out. Bruce Campbell does a great job with his Elvis impersonations. Peanut Butter and Nanner sandwich just rolls off his tongue. The Script: although it made me squirm occasionally to think of things I would rather not consider…it was extremely well written, original, creative, and made good use of inner/outer monologues. The editing: although unexplained there is a fast forward, clipped images style to some of Elvis’s views…these are done well. There are some great characters in this movie. And it was nice to see a Matlock sidekick (the young pup lawyer he takes under his wings in the later TV Movies…) playing a bit part as a funeral home employee. The acting is the gem in this movie…you really believe that they are Elvis and JFK – they so thoroughly believe it and the audience just wants to go along. The best of the good: the way they played with the cuniform. From the bathroom stalls to the subtitling I loved these concepts.  The Bad: This movie can’t decide whether it’s a B Movie, a horror movie, a character study, or a mystery. It doesn’t truly succeed as any of them so it makes it difficult to appreciate in any light.  The pacing of the movie is slower than Elvis with a walker. Not even the good acting can save it. The elderly pace doesn’t seem intentional to make a point about the world/lives of the characters either…it just seems badly done.   The Ugly: The scenes with the Scarab. Although my hubby says they are probably awesome for the budget they were working with, I was just waiting for the chainsaw to come out (See Evil Dead series to get this reference.) The mummy. I know he’s supposed to be ugly but still. The make up on Elvis is the ugliest thing in the movie though. Bruce Cambell is a young man…too young for this role. The sideburns are down right scary and badly done.   The Interesting: Some of the discomfort the movie conveys is very intriguing if not enjoyable. There are a lot of close up detail shots of ordinary object in this movie. Interesting.  Overall: I found myself searching for the nail clipper out of boredom half way through the movie. This was due to the pacing and my general lack of B Movie love. I want a t-shirt that says “I survived Bubba Ho-Tep,” and rent this with a B Movie Fanatic, with a dude you want to impress with your “Non Girly Movie” flexibility, or if you are wanting to have a Bruce Campbell Triple Feature or something (god forbid.) Mr. Campbell does have quite an underground cult following as I understand it. Way underground. Check out his autobiography for an interesting dose of life as a B Movie actor – “If Chins Could Kill.”  Chasing Liberty: starring Mandy Moore as the president of the US’s daughter who is tired of being babysat by the Secret Service and takes off for a trip around Europe with a stranger with a secret of his own.  The Good: This movie is funny! Its fun to watch! Mandy Moore is actually a talented actress – and I am looking forward to “Saved” which is coming out soon to see if her ability to choose movies and roles has improved. The film is shot in Europe so you will get a nice dose of great views, awesome architecture and accents. The Six Million Dollar Man references seriously cracked me up as random humor. The President is well played and subtly we all know he’s a democrat (with a few Clinton references to boot) without the movie actually saying so.  Left me wondering if the movie was based on a real life adventure of Chelsea or something.  Two great performances were also added by the two main Secret Service agents on Mandy Moore’s tail. The president’s daughter’s traveling companion is well done too – he’s a hotty-geek sort with a great british accent and a brilliant dead pan…what more could you ask for? They were interspersed in the action well, had a nice secondary story line, and were funny in their own right. Also, as a bonus, the soundtrack is REALLY AWESOME…with no obvious sign of Mandy Moore on it.  The Bad:  A little typical at times, but nothing overwhelming. The cut scenes are to be avoided like the plague…there is a reason they were cut. Mandy Moore’s costuming is seriously lacking and relatively blech-worthy overall. It doesn’t really take away from the movie too often…but it doesn’t add a thing and sometimes just doesn’t seem to work.   The Ugly: Ummm…I am trying to think of something to put here. Erm ...her hair in the beginning of the movie…bad wigging! That is definitely ugly. The love parade seems fairly un-authentic and way too much like MTV Spring Break, and the British punk-esque backpacker that they meet is a little over the top although still funny. They try to pack every stereotype possible into that character but he somehow still manages to come through all right.  Overall: Better than average teen coming of age movie. Funny as hell. My hubby admitted he liked it better than Bubba Ho-Tep. Watch this with anyone, alone, or in a triple feature of Mandy Moore – A Walk to Remember,  How to Deal, and Chasing Liberty. Also keep your eyes peeled for “Saved” in which she plays the “villainess” who is the ultimate bible thumper.  So that’s the movies in review recap from earlier this week. We have been catching up on the movies we missed in the theatres and other rentals we have missed.  There is still more to be reviewed in this blog. This is why a long recap is troublesome.  Girl With a Pearl Earring: Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.  A period piece about a young girl working as a maid to support her family in the house of Johannes Vermeer.  The Good: Scarlett and Colin do amazing jobs with their characters. Definitely keep your eyes open for their future careers. The color of the movie is really well done and nicely handled.  Scarlett plays a maid, and she does the work of a maid in the movie – unlike some movies where they just skim through that sort of thing. She is very authentic in her portrayal of emotion and interest and love and frustration and innocence. Yet another great love story, in which the lovers do not consummate their relationship. The tension is excellent, the emotion is raw, and the torture of what is forbidden is amazing without being in any way over blown.  The Bad: It is never explained why she keeps her hair covered ALL THE TIME. Is it religious? The ending is a little clumsy. The audience wants to know if she ends up with Piotr. It’s left up to interpretation…with nothing there to interpret. The delivery by the teary eyed head maid at the end also raises some questions. My hubby wondered at that point if it meant that Vermeer’s wife died. That thought didn’t even cross my mind. Translation…this is highly unclear.   The Ugly:  The soundtrack soars with horn segments and trumpeted announcements. Its far too loud. Its downright out of place at times.  Great touches: the paint mixing and coloration – most people have no idea that paints didn’t always come in tubes. The ice and cold and weather – little details like this make the movie feel more real. The lighting – amazing cinematography really. Did it win an Oscar? Was it nominated? The wife of Vermeer was portrayed as being a really beautiful woman. I liked that. She was a character with flaws…but she was a physical beauty nonetheless. The mother in law was well done and well played…the relationship of the painter and his family with the Patron is well explored with interesting results.   Overall: Rent this, its just a great movie with a great story, that is just really well done. It was worth seeing in the theatres by all means…but it never came to my small dinky West Virginia town.  THAT’S ALL OF THE MOVIE REVIEWS UP THROUGH THIS WEEK’S VIEWINGS. *pant pant pant*  Still to come soon: The Company – a dance movie, The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai – a B movie ala the Sci Fi genre, Harry Potter III, Van Helsing, and Connie and Carla.  For now that’s all the news in fits of print --Mack

He can barely stand or walk and has no idea what he did or when. Its baffling...but at the moment he is walking with the aid of a hiking stick I whittled quite nicely while camping two years ago. Poor baby. I feel bad for him...hes hopped up on Advil and Tylenol per my mom's recommendations. He was icing his back with a truly old fashioned rubber ice bag last night...and that seemed to help. Not sure if something is pinched, pulled, twisted or what...but what I do know is that hes in a lot of pain...and i have been waiting on him hand and foot.  Check out this story of the blog growth.

Koji Sasahara, AP   After developing some of the country's hottest Net ventures, the 37-year-old entrepreneur has a new mission: Making the journals known as weblogs, or blogs, not just a thriving business but also a key element of everyday life here.   Ito's blog (joi.ito.com) draws ceaseless chatter from a burgeoning cyber-community on a range of topics from Iraq to the U.S. presidential election and the latest in technology.   People from around the world swap links to news stories and humorous video footage in a crisscrossing web of friendships and streams of consciousness that shift as quickly as real-life conversations.   Blogs are far easier to set up than Web pages — nearly as easy as sending e-mail — so a whole new class of people can participate, Ito argues.   Bloggers can comment on and add links to photos, news articles and other blogs. Now hot in the field is mobile blogging, or moblogging, which involves creating posts from wireless devices such as camera-equipped phones.   "Weblogs are doing a lot of what people were excited about the Net when it first came out — the fact that anyone can be a publisher," Ito said at his Tokyo office while clicking now and then on blogs.   The clean-cut, boyish Ito stands out as a rare cosmopolitan entrepreneur in a nation where the elite tend to be notoriously conservative and insular. Possessing a Westernized upbringing fairly unusual for Japanese, Ito "got" the Internet just as it began to catch on in the 1990s.   A college dropout, he is the founder and chief executive of Neoteny Co., a venture capital firm that has raised $40 million. Ito has helped set up or run such companies as Infoseek Japan, the nation's second-largest portal after Yahoo! Japan, and Rakuten Inc., Japan's biggest Internet shopping site.   When not jetting around the world to lecture in France about mobile technology or sit on blogging panels at U.S. tech conferences, Ito advises the Japanese government and appears on Japanese talk shows.   But he gets his most attentive audience on his blog.   Known to friends as Joi, Ito keeps up an intense blogging habit, visiting 190 blogs regularly and averaging five hours a day reading and writing blogs. He admits blogging is addictive, but shrugs off a question about how he finds time for anything else.   He says he splits his time equally three ways — for straight work, social activism and personal life. He watches less TV, doesn't plays video games as much and has stopped drinking — to spend more time on blogs and less in bars.   "Joi is an incredibly dynamic person," said Justin Hall, an American writer on technology culture and a friend of Ito's for several years. "He's got a fantastic curiosity. His metabolism or something — he's wired a little different."   The issues Ito and other bloggers cover are broad — human rights, cool Web sites, cooking and, of course, blogging about blogging.   Blogging is such an integral part of Ito's life that he recently decided against expanding Neoteny's dozen-company portfolio to focus on Six Apart Ltd., the California company behind Movable Type and TypePad, among the leading tools for blogging.   He promotes the technology in Japan as chairman of Six Apart's Japanese subsidiary.   Ito also leads the international and mobile operations of Technorati Inc., a Web service that ranks blogs by popularity and monitors the Net for the latest buzz among bloggers.   Growing congregation  Blogs have been rapidly growing in popularity in Japan, catching on especially in the past year at a pace that's believed to lag only the United States. At least a dozen companies in Japan provide blogging services. Internet service provider Nifty, which licenses Six Apart's software, has drawn about 25,000 bloggers.   Most of the blog services are free so far. But once blogging gains acceptance as a self-publishing medium, business opportunities such as advertising and premium photo-sharing services should emerge.   Ito has yet to launch a specific moneymaking service for bloggers, but he has created a Neoteny blogging team to feed the fad.   Blogs here look similar to those in the United States. People comment on the news and music, pass around jokes, rate restaurants.   In a society that emphasizes conformity and harmony, blogging makes it easier for people to express unpopular opinions and get tangled in emotional debates.   "The thing neat about weblogs is you find each other," Ito said. "It gives you a feeling of empowerment. For grass-roots movements and things like that, it will be great."   Junjiro Hara, who has known Ito for decades, is sold on blogging and prefers it as an outlet for his views than his real job at major newspaper Asahi Shimbun.   "Japan can't change for the better until it becomes a place where everyone starts blogging," Hara said.   A fundamental change  For Ito, promoting blogging came naturally in a life already devoted to bridging Japanese and American cultures.   Ito was born in Japan but spent parts of his childhood in Canada and the United States because his father worked abroad. While in Japan, Ito attended international schools. He became fluent in English and Japanese while always feeling slightly outside mainstream Japanese society.   Ito joined friends from international schools in creating Japan's first Web pages.   "People thought we were crazy. But we had great confidence because we saw that it was going to be giant one day," said Cyrus Shaoul, one of Ito's international-school buddies. "The point wasn't to make a lot of money. The point was to change the world."   Ito believes blogging will one day prove as influential as the printing press.   "Blogging will fundamentally change the (way) people interact with media and politics and provide us with an opportunity to overhaul our outdated democracies," he said.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Oooooh I am changing the world...*waves fingers in vaguely mysterious fashion* Well then I best keep blogging. (Just when I was starting to think blogging was pretty pointless...and who really is gonna read this anyway...and if I dont blog booty will my blog ever be "discovered" and oh god...what if it is discovered??? ack!) Erm...right well then. Blogs seem to be getting alot of press lately. And here I am blogging blog press. I think this blogging of blog press might set us into a internet infinity catch 22. I shall have to use caution when perpetuating this blogging of blogging blog...Oh god, it has blog already blog started blog!!!! Hehehe.  In other news...  Apparently my whole state was under a tornado warning last night. I guess I slept through a doozy of a storm. It woke up my husband (a very very heavy sleeper...) and I was zonked. Apparently what we dont know will sometimes not hurt us.  Thats all the new in fits of print... Mack Bunbun

I wonder if she will still be that way after she goes to school. She is looking quite pensive here...She is very smart and will take up for her sister anytime.&nbsp; urlLink

      First a catch-up bit: Yesterday I went to my mothers. Usually not something I relish most of the time...I live in fear of that woman. But yesterday my cousins were there, and my uncle and his wife and their new St. Bernard. Eep! :) It was nice to see my cousins again...it had been almost a year since I had seen them last. They are both the cutest red headed girls in the universe and they are as different as night and day and still as close as two peas in a pod. I showed them how to take pictures and use a camera. It was fun. The older one of the two really seemed interested...but I swear she seems interested in anything I say...Shes my one person fan club! She laughs at any joke I crack...even if it wasnt a joke. What can I say? She gets the giggles. After spending some time out at the farm we went to dinner and then everyone by my hubby and I proceeded to go to the movies to see Shrek II. While it was a good flick...we didnt feel like going again quite so soon...so we bailed. But I warned my older cousin ahead of time (she cries sometimes when saying goodbye) that I would be seeing her in a month (July 4th weekend) and she shouldnt be concerned that we arent going to the movie. Whew. No tears. Thank goodness. She gets in trouble for things like that.  I got some great pictures of my mom's Aussie Cattle Dog and the St. Bernard Playing...and some really cute snaps of my cousins too.  We came home from our adventure and awaited the arrival of my husband sister, her hubby, and their beagle Maggie. Let the games begin. Henry and Maggie sniffed and meowed/whined at each other through the basement door but the in-law parents are determined that "ne'er the twain shall meet." So much for what they know about animals. The sister in-la,w which I guess I should pseudonym "Crafty" and her hubby "Reds", (they are from Cinci...and the husbands favorite sport/team/lifetime event is baseball and hes a Reds fanatic...although I think he will watch anything on ESPN just because its ESPN...) Well they are both nice people. Reds makes me laugh and we get along pretty well on most things. He is a teacher and has alot of interest and respect for kids...reads Lemony Snickett and whatnot...I figure anyone who reads Lemony Snickett cant be that bad! Crafty is smart and sweet and shes only 2 years older than me...but she works really hard to belong to a different world...The world of candle parties, scrap booking parties, Longaberger baskets, and quilting. These are the passtimes of so many women...and I am not sure why. An excuse to socialize? Trying to fullfill their concept of feminimity? I just dont get it. I have NO interest in any of those things...just a way to waste money to me. Candles = Cat Tail Burners. Yankee candles may be the poo but I just could care less. Longaberger baskets are the biggest gyp ever. Hello! $300 for woven scraps of wood???!?!?!?! Scrap booking was cool when it was personal and not mass produced/marketted. Now its become a Martha Stewart passtime. Quilting. Now that is something I think is kinda cool and wish I could do. I like artistic and classic quilts. They remind me of...my grandma, a time with different complications, a clean bed in a big house, and sleeping tight on a summer or winter night. Quilts kind of make me reminisce a bit. But if I made them...they would not be cheezy patterns, idyllic scenes, or antinquated country stylings. They would be true to their original idea of scraps, or abstract artistic experiements in cloth. Not kitchy "wedding quilt" silliness.  Right so have I gotten off topic or what?  I had a dream last night about picking out a dog. It was from a terrible place...something like Oliver Twist for dogs. It was a Wheaton Terrier and I recognized it from a breeder's website..which was quite nice...and not at all like Oliver Twist. I wanted to take all the dogs out of the terrible place in my dream...but I couldnt...I tried to take two...I was having a moral/ethical quadary about how to decide which dogs to take when I was awoken by the sniffing muzzle of Maggie the Beagle. :) What a better ending.  I have found that after being here for one month...I dont really care for Luke's mom much. She will complain just for the hell of it. If someone makes a simple suggestion to alleviate the issue for which she is complaining...she will ignore it. She wants to complain about the kitchen floor getting scuffy, being hot, having car troubles...I guess complaining gets her attention. But look at me now...complaining about her complaining. Ug. I try to talk to her...you know about stuff shes interested in, about stuff we are doing, about our plans and what not. Whatever it is I say she gives me cautionary warnings..."Dont come to me when you get in trouble." "It's a different generation..." "You kids do things differently..." Mind you in each of these scenarios different means bad. I dont think it occurs to her that even if we could/tried/wanted to do things the way SHE did them when she was our age...WE CANT. The world has changed...not just the generations. She says things like "We dont cook from boxes or cans" as if its a badge of honor instead of a stubborn attitude of persevering in inconvenience. Well I can rant in my blog pretty safely...and keep my tongue while I am here in her house...Most people dont lead the charmed life of being a housewife to an engineer. She talks about saving money and not spending it and whatnot...and buys $200 vitamins...what a waste considering there is no research backing that expensive vitamins absorb incredibly better than standard ones do. She doesnt want the facts about the vitamins...I didnt want her to be getting ripped off....but she wont look at the facts...the studies...the research. She forms her opinions on thin air. Without the need of fact. That is true opinion forming...the process she undergoes requires no critical thinking whatsoever.  Gah...and now my cat is sitting in front of my keyboard. I think he wants attention *dodges cat tail under nose*   Well now just so Im not seeming bitchy without balance...when we went to visit my mom she gave us an anniverssary gift (2 years since the day at the church) and it was quite generous. $200. I know they are in a money crunch (believe me I asked for help buying my run around car...and she told me what their financial situation is...they are putting up cider works) so I appreciate their generosity a lot. Well, lets just say I am thankful. Grateful.  I am also thankful and grateful to the generosity and kindness that allows us to have a free home, free food, and safe living everyday under the roof of my in-laws. They are more considerate than many I know for giving us a hand. I am not sure whether it was because they felt they couldnt say no...or what...but regardless they are permitting us to share their space...and no matter what nerve they jump up and down on...I will be thankful for their sharing of their home.  And with that Sunday is born. A day of thanks. Weekly thanksgiving...a day of prayer for many. A day of introspection as well. For me, its the longest day of the week. Dragging on like roadkill on a bumper. Maybe thats too gruesome...more like dragging on like a bad movie when you have to pee. Yeah. Thats more like a Sunday.   Well thats all the news in fits of print. --Mack

      Week One of Summer Camp has been survived.   Few tears, little blood, and only minor pain. More or less. Thursday was a small piece of hell right here on earth. 48 kids in Second and Third grade all massively grouped and raising their own inner demons to new heights. A semi difficult and ill prepared art project coupled with a late lunch made for a mid morning filled with raised voices, whistles blowing, and constant behaviour reminders. Not to say the counselors are better off at all. I had one ask me yesterday, “What do I do about spilt milk on a bench?” I blinked in disbelief for a moment. Um, clean it up? *shudders* Such has been the training and defines the initiative of the camp counselors as a whole. It’s a scary sight. They are mostly very young, and very inexperienced, and very much needing leadership of a head counselor which simply doesn’t exist this year. I think they eliminated the position for budgetary reasons. As it is one day is ridiculously different from the next. There is little consistency among counselors and the rules, and I am not looking forward to the rest of this summer. Definitely not with the Second and Third graders. My only hope is that the head honcho sees the light and places me with the older age groups. I am just not suited to the little ones.  Nonetheless there were still high points.   At one point this week I was attacked by a group of campers determined to brush the cat fur off of my shirt - I assured them that it was a useless task and the fur/lint roller had not been able to fully clean the shirt in three rounds that morning. Nevertheless, they were very persistant and quite pleased with their five inch square area free of fur on my shirt.  At lunch yesterday we were indoors due to rain and the girls were separated from the boys and started telling scary stories. It was fun to watch them interact and listen to each other...and struggle sometimes to get/keep everyone's attention. I told an old OU ghost story and they really liked it...they begged for another but I will save my arsenal for later.   Thursday I gave the kids a bit of a talk on RESPECT Aretha Franklin style...only to see my lesson duplicated and reinforced on Friday by another counselor in another group in morning circle time.  Friday the CITs (Counselors in training - youth going into 9th grade and up) moved in to join the various age groups as helpers. Both CIT's "reported" to me and asked me what they should be doing and made sure I knew where they were...This was odd since I am not in a position of authority. I let them know that, as I felt it was the right thing to do...that I appreciated them checking in but that there was no requirement to do so with me in particular. They told me that their advisor had told them that in each age group they should stick close to and follow the example of their opinion of the best counselor there...and that they thought that I was the best example in the whole camp so they volunteered for the hoodlum group of Second and Third graders.  Ah, and lastly I still have my knack and ability to get kids to trust me and evoke honesty and resolve disputes. That is good to know. I ask kids questions like, "You know it is against the rules and disrespectful to push another camper, right?" The child answers, "But I didn't do anything." I reply, "Thats not what I asked you. I am not acusing you of anything. I am just checking in with you that you are aware of the rules, and aware of your actions." I repeat the first question again, and they answer "yes." I now say "Good, that means we shouldnt have any problems with this issue in the future." Inevitably they reintone that they didnt do "it." I let them know that (and this is in a case where no one is injured and most likely both parties are semi at fault...which is the majority of the time) what happened or didnt happen is in the past at this point and that I am trying to make sure that they dont have this trouble again in the future. It is crazy surprising how well this methodology works. I always talk to both kids involved in a given dispute...and any witnesses. Rarely are physical acts unprovoked ... and the "victim" has to also be schooled in altering their behaviour to not provoke others. Whenever I talk to a kid one on one (and I do so sometimes when I just see trouble coming versus after it has happened) I let them know that they arent in trouble and that I just want to figure out what is going on with them so that they can avoid being in trouble. When I am trying to evoke the truth I give the same assurances. "Did you crowd into line." *the child shakes his head* (I know well that the truth is otherwise...and the others in line try to tell me so...I silence them and indicate that I am speaking to the one child...) "I want the truth *insert name here*. You arent in trouble, I just want the truth so that I can help everyone in the best possible way." A look of consideration crosses the child's face. "Did you crowd into line?" The child nods. Now, knowing the rest of the story was key. The boy stepped out of line, and then crowded back into his spot. Obviously his mates didnt think much of this for the most part, and I explain to all that if you step out of line you lose your spot, but that it doesnt really matter where you are standing in line. In the case of this child, I innaugurated to start the situation from scratch and told him if he left again he would have to go to the end of the line. I also thanked the kids for getting my attention to help them rather than fighting it out themselves. The "victims" felt that their fellow camper got "a talking to" of some kind from a counselor - which is often enough of a reprimand in their eyes....and the child that crowded felt that justice had been served and yet the future of similar actions was also now accounted for firmly. I think sometimes that when it comes to disolving kid conflicts that I must almost have some kind of instinct with how to deal with them and what to do and what to say. I can hardly take credit as I dont know how I do it...but the kids really value my fairness and justice. I do know that.Maintaining this knack has been key to my success as a child care worker. I was glad to see that this week it was still in place.  Rented Love Actually. A British ensemble piece that takes place at Christmastime. Starring just about all of the main Brit A-Listers, and a couple Harry Potter cast members to boot.  This movie was brilliant. Not too sappy, not too over the top, very well acted, edited and well thought out. Almost every angle or take/voice about Christmas (by those who recognize it as a holiday celebrated) was seen or heard.   The Good: The acting, the writing, the directing, the editing. The multi story line concept fused seamlessly. Stand out performances to: Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant. A great American President portrayal by Billy Bob Thorton. The young actor who played Liam Neeson’s son was also fun to watch as well as the woman who played Hugh Grant’s love interest. I loved Hugh Grant’s portrayal of Prime Minister – even his bit of dancing was hilarious evoking a british version of Tom Cruise. Perhaps Kiera Knightly learned a bit about acting from her fellow actors in this flick…but then again I doubt they were ever all together on the set for too long. My husband liked the airport wrap-around and I think he favored the stories of the step-father/son relationship blooming and the writer and Portuguese maid story.  The Bad: Ack I wanted more of a wrap up. It left me sooooooo hanging. I realize that this may have been the point but STILL. The American Milwaukee girls sequence with the character named Colin. A little too much to believe. Besides at the end when the girls come to the UK I have the distinct feeling that being British will no longer be a unique characteristic that is attractive and that our boy needs to develop a personality and but quick. The husband wife pair of Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman was not to my satisfaction resolved either. I realize too that the message intended may be something like: “This sort of marital issue cannot be resolved in the last 5 minutes of a movie…” but I wanted a hint of what direction their future was going. Just a hint. Oh, and the cover of Love is All Around that is featured as a plot element in the movie is really terrible….but its meant to be. Other than these nit picky ending dissatisfactions the movie was outstanding and really nearly perfect.  The Ugly: Some of our aging rock star’s wardrobe pieces, and the scary seafood nativity scene (though my hubby found this concept quite entertaining and I am not denying its humour – rather also intoning the scary/ugly factor.) Really, that’s all.  Overall: More thumbs than a Monkey’s Uncle up! Rent this…rent it for Christmas in July…rent it when you are feeling bitter at Christmas (note that I don’t say if you are feeling bitter at Christmas.) Rent it and watch it a couple of times!  Subject Change: my cat is being so darn cute right now. I wish I could take a picture of him…but everytime I get the camera out he just knows its out and that its pointing at him so he ceases doing whatever cuteness he was engaged in and also pretty much refuses to yawn while the camera is pointed at him. Smartass cat. Look , I typed the word camera and he moved into a more average cute position, rather than the all curled around on his back with his paws over his eyes in the air position. *sigh*  Right then. Today is Saturday and I have homework I should be doing right now. Ick. I am luxuriating in my day off work…and wondering what I have done in setting up an appointment with the new executive director of the YMCA. I cant really handle more hours of work too easily, and I doubt they will take me off my childcare duties. My original intent was to get reinstated to my graphics duties but now I am just not so sure. I tossed and turned last night worrying over it.  Also we have rented more movies and borrowed some from the library as well. I will likely try to review them each – unless my limited audience is finding my movie reviewing to be a drone…Which I would appreciate any commentary on.  Life at the in laws goes on. We had limited discussion of Ronald Reagan…my mother in law intoned that the media will stop deifying him once he is underground and cant hear them anymore. My father in law insisted that Reagan toppled communists and I reiterated again and again that it was the people of the USSR and Germany who did the toppling and they deserve the credit for overcoming the regimes that weren’t meeting their needs.   Read a blip today about Senator McCain (R, Arizona) denying that he has been asked to be – nor that he would accept- a vice presidential nomination/candidacy from John Kerry. This would be a very unique combination, and one I think I would still vote for. I think a bi-partisan ticket would be an interesting experiment in the US government. For a few years now I have said that the presidential losing candidate should get the VP office anyways…It would be a perilous walk to walk at some points I am sure but I think the end result would be better leadership. A Dem and Rep combo? We couldn’t get any worse that what we have now so why the hell not.   Tonight is dinner with my step dad for a fathers day get together a bit early as he will be out of town next weekend. Tomorrow I go to my moms for dinner with the distant relatives (distant physically - coming from Las Vegas and Newfoundland) of my mom’s hubby….this will be the third time I have met them I think. So no peace for the weary this weekend.   Supposedly Terminal came out this weekend, but it is not playing here. Stepford Wives, and The Notebook are however and we may try to see one of those this weekend. On the other hand we may hold off and rent them…money is a bit tightish.  As the Beatles intoned…Oh Blah Di Oh Blah Dah life goes on, Bra! La La how the life goes on.  All the news in fits of print— Mack

      Summertime = Summer Camp. This has been the overriding equation of my existence since I was 7 years old or so. The only difference is that now I am a camp counselor - not a camper. I have so far survived 2 days of YMCA summer camp, mostly unscathed. It has been two days of confusion, messes, a bit of insanity, and a lot of kids. A lot of things are different this year from last year. The daily camp schedule, how it’s laid out, how the kids are grouped, and how the counselors and staff are scheduled is just a start. One of the big changes that may not last is that swimming has been relegated to one day a week for each age group. This has been a source of pretty major complaints from kids…and I think that the parents will chime in next via their kid’s opinions. We shall see how it goes.  So far our new camp director is hanging in there. He’s not a person who is a rule follower nor is he one of those people that are really very authoritarian. The result is someone who does not want to be in charge, and does not excel at it…being in charge.  It’s a little crazy to say the least. Most of my fellow counselors did not receive adequate training…and haven’t got a clue. All in all the experience has been nerve wracking. But, I have survived Day 2. One little link to my past…an old YMCA Day Camp friend of mine Naloni now brings her son to day camp. Scary. He’s 8 I think.  I feel so old sometimes.  More blogging news about blogs in my blog: (I cant resist the blogging paradox) Nike is going to be using blogs to promote their shoes. They will be dispersing little clips of artsy films to one of the larger blog engines. It should be interesting to see what happens with the “underground anti mainstream” culture that blogs embody when faced with voluntarily visiting a consumerism driven commercial blog. Nike’s statement about the promotional concept included the fact that they are targeting the bloggers for these ads and that they know it is a somewhat narrower audience but that they are a very important audience. Nice to know.  I also recently read about a project called Wizard People, Dear Reader by Brad Neely. This feature is his own personal darkly funny and adult oriented version of the soundtrack to Harry Potter I. He recorded his own dialog doing various voices and reinventing the characters. I read that Potter and Pals are transformed into pre-teen alcoholics, that quidditch takes on homoerotic overtones, and that it’s more or less downright funny. It’s been a reported hit at underground film festivals and various screenings around the country…The cool thing is it is available to download at www.illegal-art.org. So anyone can screen the soundtrack on CD simultaneously with their DVD of Harry Potter I. The funny thing  is that this soundtrack is likely not illegal. The files are just sound files, its still up to the viewer to supply the movie and the whole off the wall concept likely falls under spoof art. Of course Neely’s  not the first to pull a stunt like this with a movie – Woody Allen did something similar with What’s Up Tiger Lilly, and more recently Steve Odekirk did his own twist with Kung Pow Chicken. However, both of those movies used foreign and little known kung fu flicks. Neely may have re-invented a pastime and pop-art form that may be quite the fad for contemporary big hit movie fans.      Quick and Dirty Reviews:  The Company: Starring Neve Campbell (Party of 5 and Scream,) Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange and Tank Girl,) and James Franco (Spiderman I & II.) The story is about the Joffery Ballet Company in Chicago and features the life and times of an up and coming dancer. This movie was directed by Robert Altman of Gosford Park fame – I had high hopes.   Boy, were they ever doused.  This movie is big on filming dance on stage, and small on plot. It was difficult to tell the characters apart even at the end - we knew so little of them that they all blended in together. The time line was shaky, and so was the overall movie concept.   The Good: SOME of the dancing. There were moments that were nice, seemed authentic, and like it might be a real dance for the Joffery.  There were occasional funny moments. Occasional. Neve Campbell’s arm muscles were impressive…and hard to miss when she shoots a mediocre game of pool.  There was a wacky costumed dance in the final performances…and as it was planned throughout the movie it sounded really goofy…but when it all came together…it was kinda cool. Oh, and the high point of the movie was a New Year’s roast performed by the company.  The Bad: Ack!!! Some of the dancing was downright awful/elementary and not at all representative of the Jofferey Ballet Company. McDowell spends the movie playing the same action over and over and over again. His company director is way one dimensional. The worst NoNo is the lack of plot. Seriously. There is no plot resolution or outright goals or points of suspense nor do we understand what the point really is.  There is so little plot it is a challenge to review.  The Ugly: A few of the dance costumes were a little over the top ugly. Some of the dialogue is pretty heavy dancerese. This means that some people just might not get what the hell is happening. The script/movie was partly Neve’s Campbells idea and seems like a plug for her as a dancer more than anything else.  Overall: Don’t rent this. I recommend that you don’t see this - even if you love dance. If you liked Fame, Camp, or any other movie of a similar genre you might sit through this and critique the hell out of it…but I wouldn’t pay for it. Well I did…but I don’t suggest anyone else should!  Buckaroo Bonzai: 80’s Cult Sci Fi flick with a host of actors that are now more or less famous including: John Lithgow, Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Goldblum, and Ellen Barkin. The concept is based around Buckaroo Bonzai – a half Japanese half American Neurosurgeon, Rock and Roll Star, and King Fu expert who is involved with a project to break through the dimensional barriers using a rocket propelled car with a little device called an oscillating overthruster. The success of this experiment threatens to cause intergalactic war. Buckaroo is a hugely popular figure in the world of this movie and has his bandmates for sidekicks and his own groupies as back up.    The Good:  Kind of fun, obscure, sci-fi flick that is worthy of a cult following. The 80’s era music that the band played was catchy as hell. The movie features aliens that are all named John, the inclusion of Orson Well’s War of the Worlds as a plot element in the script, and Jeff Goldblum dressed as a cowboy – need I say more?  The Bad:  Difficult to hear the dialogue at times…then super loud when it comes to sound effects. Of course the special effects and costumes are from the time period of the 80’s…and well…they are a step above Dr. Who and a step below Alien I. Somewhere imbetween. The plot had a few holes of genius and whatnot in it as well as a bizarre president character and white house staff. We don’t get the know most of the characters very well, and they are essential characters from the book of the same/similar title on which the movie is based.  The Ugly: The alien space ships. Ug. Hello…not even aerodynamic in the slightest.  Overall: A fun flick for that kind of sci fi cult movie genre. Totally a popcorn flick and the kind of movie that really could be another big hit if remade now (with a few tweaks.) There is a book, and I found it fairly hard to follow, the movie is pretty much more clear. Rent this if you can find it at your local video store…Rent it for a fun 80’s sci fi flash back. A good triple feature: Buckaroo Bonzai, the BBC version of Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and Spaceballs.  That’s all the news for now, in fits of print – Mack

      Ah, the good old double feature.  There is really nothing like a Drive In movie theatre. You have to go see for yourselves. Go before the mosquitoes get bad. Go have the experience of the outdoor movie viewed from your car. It’s not to be missed.  Last night we went to see a double drive in feature of VanHelsing and Connie and Carla. Sitting through the first one was worth it to see the second one. VanHelsing was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I don’t mean that in a complimentary fashion. It seemed like it couldn’t go wrong: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, a monster hunter, cool gadgets, lots of monsters, and a vampiric bad guy. How could this movie have failed? In this day and age, with the special effects that abound…it seemed that it would rake in kudos in acting, effects, and whatnot. What went wrong?   I would have to say that the director, Stephen Sommers, is to blame. In my mind this was a career ending movie for him. Jackman and Beckinsale have proved themselves as actors of skill and capable of handling the genre (Beckinsale played a vampire who hunts other vampires in Underworld quite recently and Jackman is quite well known for playing Wolverine – which isn’t too far a step from a werewolf and certainly has the drive for hunting down the bad guys.) So we can’t blame the actors. They did all they could.   The special effects were seamless enough. No cheesy moments, good CPU animation work, and it was uniform in style and theme. The costuming can get a bit of abuse it was obvious that being completely anachronistic and a hinderance to the purpose of the characters at times was not considered. Have you ever seen a non-anime vampire hunter with hair in his/her face? Not if they want to stay alive. Plus, women of that time period didn’t wear their hair down – if but rarely. Certainly not on an ordinary day in their life. And often if it was down…it was half up, with combs or baubles of some sort. Yeah, so I am picking a fight with the hair designer in the costuming department. Still, even bad hair cannot truly sink a movie…if it could Harry Potter’s Malfoy would have sunk the whole enterprise of Potter flicks.   Why was VenHelsing so bad? This is still up for debate. There were some rough edits and cuts…some rocky transitions…but all in all superior to the Harry Potter 3 transitions. The editor cant be blamed for VanHelsing. Aha! The script? Yes, the script is in part to blame. It was anachronistic in word choice, jilted, and poorly cut and edited. Some lines that were said back to back by one character had absolutely nothing to do with each other. Beyond that, exposition came a across as exposition, the characters were written in a fairly one dimensional manner, and there was little complexity to the characters at all. It would be fair to say that Frankenstein’s monster was the most complex character on screen, and somehow the only one I really cared about. It’s saying something that when one of the main characters dies at the end…I didn’t really care.  So the script carries some of the weight of failure. But wait! Who wrote it??? The director, Stephen Sommers, is to blame for this as well. Aha! So he gets one count of extreme script dereliction against him. While the image of artistic unity of the movie was preserved (a main job of a director) it seemed that the vision of plot and structure was clouded and incomplete. The concepts and ideas were “almost there” to that critical moment of solidity, but efforts to improve the concepts were abandoned too soon.   The whole underground Catholic Church theme was not delved into deep enough. The audience is left wondering why there seems to be a James Bond style medieval lab with Q as a monk. The whole left hand of god reference is also baffling. What is the significance of this? What is the point or meaning? We never really learn. It also begs the question: “Then just where is God's right hand?”  We understand that the history of the main gypsy family is a long one, with much strife and attempts to kill Drakula - but we don’t really know why, and we aren’t curious in the least. Some vague connections and references are made, but the audience just isn’t given enough bait to get involved with the mystery. Some flashbacks to previous generations would have been of some use.   Oh, and as far as VanHelsing’s forgotten memory and identity – this is also skimmed. Not enough information is given so as to actually interest the audience. When his history is finally revealed, we had all but forgotten about the point of it. One more big plot gripe – random and occasional anachronisms. I love gadgets – don’t get me wrong. And anachronistic gadgets can work if completely imbedded with detail and concept in the story. For example, the recent version of  Sleep Hollow featured lots of gadgets employed by Johnny Depp’s character – and they were anachronistic but they worked in the story. These gadgets, as used by Hugh Jackman’s character, just stood out and did not meld well with the story. The Vampire’s gadgets and electricity fit more precisely and were more understood. The bit of background on Dr. Frankenstein did all the filling in needed for the audience to accept the super charged electrical invention…although the networking of the hatchery was a little fishy.  Stephen Sommers gets two slaps to the wrist for not directing his actors to fill out his vision. The friar is off in his own little world of landing the most irrelevant actions and getting caught up in his funny voice instead of delivering his lines well. Frankenstein’s monster seems to have gotten the vocal chords of a dead opera singer – for he proclaimed most of his lines in a singing ariatic format. (Without seeming to do so intentionally or with purpose.) Also, I do have to say that Ms. Beckinsale came off sounding more like a vampire than Drakula himself. Whether that is because she is more talented with accents and Drakula was lacking or because she was overdoing it…you be the judge. My guess is that they didn’t hire any accent coaches and that the actors learned on their own from tapes and whatnot. The priest from the beginning of the movie sounds like Super Holy Mario more than actually sounding Italian.   Lastly and certainly not least in my crucifixion of the end of Stephen Sommer’s Hollywood career is an almost unforgivable movie sin. Microphones show themselves in at least 5 scenes or shots. These offending amplifiers can be seen hanging over the actors heads in scenes starting with the scene featuring the gypsy princess, VanHelsing, and Frankenstein’s monster in the bottom of the burnt out ruins of the windmill. They show up there somewhat consistently for more than five minutes. It looks like the bottom of a song and dance cane over their heads – it’s a Boom Mic. Then again the microphones invade in some later scenes in the woods. We see the whole top of a microphone once again over their heads.   This is an amateur movie-maker error. It’s beyond reproach why no one caught it, cut it, or re-shot it. The director totally carries the blame for that one. Did Mr. Sommers not ever watch the final version of his movie? This is the legitimate stage equivalent to having your stage manager walk out on stage to hand someone a prop, or leaving a scrim half in or out. No one should see the technical magic of the show or entertainment. It should be a mystery and hidden from the audience. We know there is a camera, microphones, costumes, props, and makeup. We don’t want to see the reality behind the escape unless it’s a documentary or a making-of special. Bad Director – no career for you!  In the end: VanHelsing  The Good: Special effects, creature transformations, and casting. It should have been a great movie!  The Bad: See above 6 paragraph rant. Some other notes: time is not handled well in the movie. A full moon only lasts 2 or 3 nights…and they are a month apart. There is something wonky in the timing thereof. Once again, someone spent too much time on the closing credits and not enough time on the movie, and what’s up with the sudden Drakula castle weather change - from snow to downpour of rain and lightening with no imbetween.  The Ugly: The image of the end of one man’s Hollywood career. RIP Stephen Sommers.  All in all: Don’t see this unless you are being paid a lot to do so, or if you want to write a paper in Film School of what not to do, or unless you made up a drinking game of some kind to go along with this cinema disaster.  Harsh I know. It deserved it. Bubba Ho-Tep was a better movie. Now that’s saying something.  Onto the enjoyable part of the evening!   Connie and Carla: starring Nia Vardalos (My Big Fat Greek Wedding) and Toni Collette (Muriel’s Wedding.) The concept is two dinner theatre performers who haven’t yet seen success witness a mob hit and have to hit the road. They decide to go to a place “without any culture whatsoever” so they go to LA. Once there they audition for a night club and get jobs performing as Drag queens. That’s right they are women, pretending to be men, dressed as women. Puts “Some Like it Hot” to shame – although it is regrettable that they didn’t reference the Marilyn Monroe flick in the slightest.   The Good: Great performances by Vardalos and Collette. Amazing comedic timing and great singing voices to boot. Gay men were prevalent in the movie but to the best of my discernment were not relegated to stereotypes…other than enjoying musical theatre of course. David Duchovy put in a great effort as the uptight straight guy who is trying to get to know his brother (a drag queen) for the first time in 16 years or so. The characters were over the top enough to be funny and still stay real. At least that’s my opinion. The drag queens in the movie did great work and it makes me wonder which ones are drag queens full time. The explanation of where the term drag comes from is quite handy too.   It was quite enjoyable to watch Vardalos and Duchovy work very hard on not seeming to be involved in a dating ritual. He being straight and thinking Nia’s character is a man…she being straight and being a woman. It was quite entertaining and an interesting commentary on the friendships embarked upon between members of the straight and gay community. Loved Debbie Reynolds. Loved the stand up comedy moments.   The Bad: The “Your voice is giving me (name your disease here)” jokes got way old and way obviously placed toward the middle and to the end of the movie. There is one of these in particular that just sticks out completely from the action. There are a few painfully cheesy moments…but the audience does seem to want to go along with it.   The closing number gave me pause however. In the final number in the movie Connie and Carla are "out" as women and no longer in drag, but the drag queens that share their act with them are not in drag either. The former queens are dressed as men – men with a lot of eye makeup, but men nonetheless. It just didn’t seem right to me. It was like the message of the scene was “Now that there are ‘real’ women onstage we can have no queens" – the men are now relegated to dressing as men.  One of the points of the theme of the movie that made this movie quite solid is that drag queens dress as they feel inside, so what does that say about the closing number? Are they being oppressed by sharing the stage with the image of “real women”?   I was also slightly disappointed in some of the song choices for the movie…but I suppose they had to hit the dinner theatre/gay community classics. Oh, and the ending again -not that it’s bad in the wrap up, or didnt fit or anything, but it seems to me that Connie and Carla outing themselves as women to their theatre audience and friends wouldn’t have gone so smoothly. The character of the woman at the spa saves the scene and saves Connie and Carla…but it seems a little far fetched. I guess I would have brought the resolution about a little slower if I was making the directorial choices.  The Ugly: Ack some of the wigs. Though I suppose that the wigging needed to be semi artificial…but still! The portrayal of  Mary – David Duchovy’s girlfriend – was a little harsh and one sided. Not that I wanted her and David to stay together (thereby robbing Vardalos’ character of her romantic interest) but I did want to see her apologize for her ignorance and hurtful words. David did it…and did it well…but it seems the message here is that some people are closed minded and will stay that way – rather than putting down roots toward universal acceptance.   Bonus: The Russian thug hit man who transforms into a musical theatre fanatic is quite entertaining. Seeing this with theatre people, or gay friends would be waaaay fun, and probably involve some singing along to boot.  Overall: Not as stellar as Vardalo’s cinematic debut…but that would be a hard act to follow. Very enjoyable and fun movie in which Toni Collette really shines. I am curious to see what members of the gay community and drag community had to say about the flick – if it had a wildly popular underground/gay culture following. I wouldn’t know sitting in Podunk West Virginia. Definitely rent it/watch it/catch it in a second run theatre or something. It’s a fun, melodic, feel good, comedy with a semi-unique plot and a definite new twist on cross dressing in the movies.  Wow…what long reviews today. I should apologize for my verbosity.  I also took some pictures of the Jungle Drive In Movie Theatre…and will post those later.   On a different note altogether: President Ronald Reagan has kicked the bucket.  I have read nothing but nice little articles saying what great efforts he put into ending the Cold War, and how he revolutionized the Republican party, and had the all-time to-date highest approval rating... blah blah blah.  I hate how people get idealized in their passing. It seems that there is a rule that say that people must say only nice things (in public) about someone right after they die. Not out of disrespect to a man I didnt know, but I think its more important that people and the media are sincere.   Reagan was a man that had little qualification for public office other than fame. A man who sold the arms to Iran and Iraq and even Afghanistan that have been used against the US in many ways since then. A President who got the country into the largest debt in history (although GW Bush might out do him if given another four years..) A man who I never heard a nice thing said about not even once when I was growing up. A man who shunned his gay son, repressed AIDS education as much as possible, and contributed beyond any other president to nuclear proliferation. Yeah. Him.   The character of Alex Keaton from Family Ties (played by Michael J. Fox) idolized him. I think with Reagan’s death so goes Alex Keaton. The character itself will have no purpose.   Reagan - who could have spoken out sooner as being pro-stem cell research to save his own life - if he wasn’t so concerned with his conservative image.   Does no one remember Reaganomics? The trickle down economy theories?   Why do people seem to publicly forget the errors of a person when they cease to breathe? I know this isn’t truly the case - that people hold grudges way beyond the grave and that with the passing of some the world sighs a collectively in relief.  So why the positive spin of PR? Out of honor or respect? How is it respectful to paint everything rosy and gloss the truth? Or perhaps that is the media’s biggest Reagan Eulogy ever - remembering his presidency in the hidden factual, half information, “I do not recall,” ignore the problem, trickle down truth manner in which he lead our country for 8 years. The media is honoring Reagan by reverting into Reaganites. Somehow that seems appropo and quite scary all at once.   Side Note: I find it quite disturbing that the body of Reagan will be flying (with a return trip) coast to coast for his honorings. Imagine having a dead president in a coffin in the cargo bay below your seat on an airplane. Beyond eerie.  In closing salute: The man who put Bonzo to bed had gone to his final resting place as well. The judgement of whoever he believed his maker to be, will be the final one. Whatever spiritual faith he had will guide him where he deserves to go. Reagan (like anyone else) is not really for any other human to judge – but I do think we should remember him accurately. Idealizing a President has gotten this country into a lot of trouble in the past three years, and it certainly wont help Reagan now.  All the news in long-ass fits of print... Mack

      This is a letter which I emailed to the Ralph Nader campaign contact info and directed to be referred directly to Mr. Nader with a reply from him if possible. Who knows what good it will do, but here you have it.  Dear Mr. Nader,  I first must say that I have much respect for you, your beliefs, and your efforts. I wholeheartedly support your political platform, and under different circumstances I would be one of your most avid supporters. But as the world stands at this moment, I am compelled to take a different stance. Thus, I am writing in an attempt to persuade you to cease your current presidential campaign. I am not doing this because I am against you, but rather that I cannot be "for" you when it might mean that Bush will regain the Whitehouse and our country will have to suffer another four years being led by the worst kind of fool rather than another.   I feel that for the benefit of the United States, as a whole, this country needs to band together as much as possible to oust Bush. He has "led" (I use that term loosely) the US down a dangerous road that will have grave results for the US people and the citizens of the world - some of the backlash we have already seen. With Bush in office for another four years the US will only continue to lose power in the world theatre of politics, continue to get into greater debt, continue to jeopardize social security, continue to ignore the roots of educational issues, continue to not provide for its people and others around the globe in need, and continue to create a conservative christian government that believes itself to be the only truly important government on this globe.   I sincerely believe that putting another person in the Whitehouse this year is key, and I am sorry to say (and you have to be aware) that sadly, you can not be that person. Barring Kerry dropping out of the race, there are too many barriers for a third party to achieve election for a national office. Our current US government system is not built to support/host three parties at this current time, and legal changes need to be waged against the federal and state governments before a three party system can truly exist that is in any way representative and viable. For now, a third party simply syphons votes from other candidates/parties rather than having a dedicated electorate of their own party that is sizeable enough to gain a majority vote.   I would like to see the two party system change, as I feel a multiparty system would greatly benefit both our country's voters and governing methods. Two options on how to stand for an issue is not enough. The world is not black and white and neither are the opinions of the electorate. Changing to a multiparty system needs to happen - and it will. But this change will take time, and I believe that you can make great inroads into changing the political party organization policies of the US using your individual skills and talents. It will require funding and a federal government edict - but I know in the not too distant future we will see an Independant and Green Party Candidate (or something similar) on every ballot for every office. That time is not now. I think your efforts are better placed in creating the multiparty system for the citizens of the future, rather than running for national office under the current two party system.  Some have the sad tendency to "what if" about the 2000 presidential election and wonder if Gore would be in office now if you had not run in 2000. How different would the world be? How many lives would have been spared? I know many people ponder these things, letting their brains run in indefinte circles. Really the 2000 elections are more or less a moot point now - but it would be a shame to see people spend even more time letting their minds run on the hamster wheel of "what if" about the 2004 elections. Not to say that anyone blames you for the votes Bush got (illegally or not.) But, I cant help but sometimes join the wondering: "Would Gore have been able to carry the presidency if it had been a 2-way race?" Speculation on this point is, as I mentioned, too little too late. Many political analysts have wasted hours writing and thinking about the way 2000 election might have gone, and the way Gore would have led the country after 9/11. I do not intend to waste my time this way, nor yours. But for the overall benefit to the future of our country, I ask you to stop this candidacy.  I support your political platform wholeheartedly, and if it was a two way race between you and Bush this letter I am writing would have a wholly different content. I can understand that you want to stay in the race until the point where we can tell whether Kerry is staying without a doubt. I dont want this country to be stuck choosing Bush, Bush, or Bush. But before that fateful date of polling in November I must ask, beg, plead, whine, whimper, and cajole you let go of your presidential dreams for the 2004 election year. I know many of the voters that would vote for you are as much against Bush as anyone. Their votes would be better served to remove him from office if they are counted on Kerry's tab. I dont want this country to suffer another four years with a Bush as our nations leader.  Please consider my opinion and request/suggestion. I am not trying to be rude or insulting nor do I mean to ask you to be a quitter. I dont want you to quit your beliefs or third party efforts. I want you to continue - I feel that you have a great contribution to make to our "great society." But as for the Whitehouse, as for the currently two-way system, as for 2004 - please choose your fights wisely and consider the larger repercussions. I do not mean this letter to be offensive or anger-inducing in any way, and am writing only to make some greater and personal effort to un-elect our current president. I hope you can understand my views and my wishes, even if you dont quite see eye to eye with them. Consider my opinion please, and take just a moment to think of the potential greater good.   Sincerely, (included real name and contact info here)  All the news in fits of print for the moment - Mack

      Noonday in the Shade     By Paul Krugman     New York Times      Tuesday 22 June 2004       In April 2003, John Ashcroft's Justice Department disrupted what appears to have been a horrifying terrorist plot. In the small town of Noonday, Tex., F.B.I. agents discovered a weapons cache containing fully automatic machine guns, remote-controlled explosive devices disguised as briefcases, 60 pipe bombs and a chemical weapon - a cyanide bomb - big enough to kill everyone in a 30,000-square-foot building.       Strangely, though, the attorney general didn't call a press conference to announce the discovery of the weapons cache, or the arrest of William Krar, its owner. He didn't even issue a press release. This was, to say the least, out of character. Jose Padilla, the accused "dirty bomber," didn't have any bomb-making material or even a plausible way to acquire such material, yet Mr. Ashcroft put him on front pages around the world. Mr. Krar was caught with an actual chemical bomb, yet Mr. Ashcroft acted as if nothing had happened.       Incidentally, if Mr. Ashcroft's intention was to keep the case low-profile, the media have been highly cooperative. To this day, the Noonday conspiracy has received little national coverage.       At this point, I have the usual problem. Writing about John Ashcroft poses the same difficulties as writing about the Bush administration in general, only more so: the truth about his malfeasance is so extreme that it's hard to avoid sounding shrill.       In this case, it sounds over the top to accuse Mr. Ashcroft of trying to bury news about terrorists who don't fit his preferred story line. Yet it's hard to believe that William Krar wouldn't have become a household name if he had been a Muslim, or even a leftist. Was Mr. Ashcroft, who once gave an interview with Southern Partisan magazine in which he praised "Southern patriots" like Jefferson Davis, reluctant to publicize the case of a terrorist who happened to be a white supremacist?       More important, is Mr. Ashcroft neglecting real threats to the public because of his ideological biases?       Mr. Krar's arrest was the result not of a determined law enforcement effort against domestic terrorists, but of a fluke: when he sent a package containing counterfeit U.N. and Defense Intelligence Agency credentials to an associate in New Jersey, it was delivered to the wrong address. Luckily, the recipient opened the package and contacted the F.B.I. But for that fluke, we might well have found ourselves facing another Oklahoma City-type atrocity.       The discovery of the Texas cyanide bomb should have served as a wake-up call: 9/11 has focused our attention on the threat from Islamic radicals, but murderous right-wing fanatics are still out there. The concerns of the Justice Department, however, appear to lie elsewhere. Two weeks ago a representative of the F.B.I. appealed to an industry group for help in combating what, he told the audience, the F.B.I. regards as the country's leading domestic terrorist threat: ecological and animal rights extremists.       Even in the fight against foreign terrorists, Mr. Ashcroft's political leanings have distorted policy. Mr. Ashcroft is very close to the gun lobby - and these ties evidently trump public protection. After 9/11, he ordered that all government lists - including voter registration, immigration and driver's license lists - be checked for links to terrorists. All government lists, that is, except one: he specifically prohibited the F.B.I. from examining background checks on gun purchasers.       Mr. Ashcroft told Congress that the law prohibits the use of those background checks for other purposes - but he didn't tell Congress that his own staff had concluded that no such prohibition exists. Mr. Ashcroft issued a directive, later put into law, requiring that records of background checks on gun buyers be destroyed after only one business day.       And we needn't imagine that Mr. Ashcroft was deeply concerned about protecting the public's privacy. After all, a few months ago he took the unprecedented step of subpoenaing the hospital records of women who have had late-term abortions.       After my last piece on Mr. Ashcroft, some readers questioned whether he is really the worst attorney general ever. It's true that he has some stiff competition from the likes of John Mitchell, who served under Richard Nixon. But once the full record of his misdeeds in office is revealed, I think Mr. Ashcroft will stand head and shoulders below the rest.

      I have been AWOL. I know. To my 4 or 5 dedicated readers I apologize sincerely. Time has not lent itself to my musings much since I started my summer employment at the YMCA. Beyond the time involved in my work, my brain is fried after I am done for the work-day. Plus, I have the strings of school tugging at me with summer courses that are the educational equivalent of "quick and dirty." There is alot to handle in a short period of time. Please forgive me my few readers, and know that I will be catching up in a big way this weekend - hopefully to never get quite so far behind again. However, for the remainder of the summer I would only guess that I will be able to post twice a week or so...at least until summer camp and or summer school winds down.  With that....a mini-recap of what has happened since my last posting:  Ralph Nader has not replied to my email. How rude!  I took a vacation for what was Week 3 of summer camp, but we were unable to go camping as planned due to a mousey invasion involving the turning of our tent floor into a swiss cheese style piece of performance art. Instead we spent a week relaxing (and me studying for a final exam for summer school.) We took time to make sure we lounged around, and my husband went fishing.  And of course I got sunburned. Even with sunblock on. My husband's fishing = me getting sunburned. The more fish he catches the worse the sun damage is. I swear there must be an equation somewhere that explains the ratio and size of fish as relative to the pain and redness of a sunburn. I will post some pics of the fist he caught this weekend. He threw them all back – I think its shameful for people to fish or hunt for food when they have other food sources equally as available to them.  My job at summer camp has changed slightly. When I came back from my "vacation" I found that some people had been fired, some things had been switched around, and in general I had missed some good gossip - not that I pay attention to work-related gossip mind you! I would now be manning the sign in/sign out table for summer camp where the parents essentially check in and out their children from the YMCA like they were baggage at a baggage claim or books in a library. I have done this job before and I don't mind it. I have alot of experience communicating with parents, although I do now miss getting to actually spend time with the kids. Plus I had just stocked my backpack with a summer campers dream - games galore, card decks, drawing supplies, crossword puzzles, dominoes, uno, etc. So my bag o'fun was now rendered practically useless to the kids since I was at the table addressing the issues that their parents bring up. Isnt that just another example of Murphy's Law and timing. When a person is aptly prepared and experienced with something, they will no longer be asked to do it and instead be informed they will do something else for which they must make entirely different preparations. Such is life.  Movies I have seen and shall review include: Around the World in 80 Days, Dodgeball, Terminal, Stepford Wives, Spiderman II, and the all-important Fahrenheit 9/11. Rentals including: The Producers, Flashdance, and some old episodes of “The Saint” and BBC Sherlock Holmes TV Movies from the library.  Video game to be reviewed: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.  We were supposed to go on vacation last weekend to Deep Creek Lake, MD to see my family and have a nice Fourth of July. However last Friday I developed a severe case of vertigo which left it impossible for me to travel in the car even for short trips without serious dizziness and nausea – little of all the entire trip to Maryland. This past week has been something between Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo” and Mel Brook’s “High Anxiety” – and in either case has been the result of an inner ear viral infection that has thrown my balance for a loop. I am still recovering as I type. I have improved significantly, but car rides still make me woozy to the point of lack of ability to function. All in all I havent really been back to work since Friday. I was there for a couple of hours yesterday but I was mostly useless and not able to see straight enough to mark the right kids as present on the roster when they arrived!  Hmmm…otherwise life goes on.  My husband bought me a stuffed bunny rabbit to cheer me up while I was sick. The rabbit is so darn cute for a stuffed animal. I named it FlapJack. It’s still new but already I can’t sleep without it. I think summer camp is making me regress. I caught up on Sluggy Freelance a few days ago. (My favorite online comic as some of you may remember)  During my “getting behind on my blog” interval I also read about blog sites starting to charge for their services. I hope this doesn’t happen with my blog provider. It seems to be counter productive to the whole concept of free internet publishing to charge money for the service. *shakes head in wonderment* But I suppose it is the fate of all good things about the internet to eventually cost money. I just hope I don’t lose this record of Blogs due to some paying set up someday.  Well I will catch up further over the weekend per my promise. I hope everyone out there in blog land is doing well and taking care.  That’s all the news in fits of print. --Mack

      I load up my blog today, just like any other average blog loading day, and I find that it now was word processing tools. I can change my font, make it different colors, justify it, bullet it, and by appearances...even insert a picture within the body of my text if I wish. WOW. Cool.  &nbsp;  Onto more personal news:  Yesterday was the last night of the Fair...and Buddy Jewel played with the sponsorship and introduction by my hubby's radio station. Since most of my readers also share the lack of country music fan status that I boast I will explain just who this guy is. He won the all&nbsp;country music versionAmerican Idol, Nashville Star, with a song written for his daughter called "Help Pour Out the Rain." It's a schmaltzy little ditty that got airplay left and right. It's about his daughter asking him if when she goes to heaven she can be one of the angels that helps pour out the rain. It caught the attention of a lot of country music fans, and the album the song is on went gold last January - as he reminded his audience several times. Right, well I didn't stay to watch his set - he and his band just didnt put on the show that Emerson Drive did.&nbsp; He did cover Bob Seeger, but even that can't save a man who considers it kosher to perform in way loose muscle shirts. The odd thing about Buddy is that he looks soooooooooooo much like a younger version of my step dad it is a little scary. I took a few pictures of him, which I will post later.  &nbsp;  My hubby's parents are gone for a week!!! Yay! We get to live like normal private individuals who don't live with their extended family!!! My excitement is bubbling over.  &nbsp;  I read that Whoopi Goldberg lost her job with Slim Fast&nbsp;due to making a joke about Bush at a Democratic campaign of some kind featuring several Hollywood stars...apparently she used his last name to refer to a female sexual region. She can't have been the first. I guess Slim Fast' s corporate headquarters is in Florida where Jeb Bush still rules the roost. Funny how it all works out.  &nbsp;  I also read a USA Today story about the rapper Jadakiss whom, for the record, I have never hear of before. Apparently seven words in his new song have attracted alot of attention - "Why did Bush knock down the towers?" Radio stations and MTV are both running edited versions of the song at the moment.&nbsp; This is a new form of artistic censorship. It doesnt involve cussing, nor sexual innuendo. They have censored his political statement. So much for freedom of speech and artistic integrity. So much for one's more man's ability to cast a critical eye toward the presidency.&nbsp; According to the article, Jadakiss says he doesnt actually blame Bush for the towers falling but rather thinks Bush&nbsp;hasnt taken responsibility for&nbsp;not protecting the country well enough before September 11th and for not taking care of business properly since. In the article Jadakiss also mentions&nbsp;"Fahrenheit 9/11" and it is mentioned that he back John Kerry&nbsp;and is registering to&nbsp;vote himself for the first time. Of all the rap lines and songs to get the radio edit,&nbsp;this instance strikes me as rediculous. Lines about god arent removed from songs, lines about booty shakin' make it to the airwaves, even some cleverly embedded lines about drugs and sex find their way to radio listeners ears. Its an abosilute shame that&nbsp;members of the&nbsp;media today doesnt&nbsp;back&nbsp;the first ammendment in cases where it doesnt conflict with FCC regulations.  &nbsp;  *Jumps off Soap Box*  &nbsp;  And now for the promised movie review:  I, Robot: Will Smith, a robot named Sonny  The premise of this movie is  loosly  based on the book of the same title by Issac Asimov, which I think I read in Junior High, but cant actually remember. I admit I read a few reviews about the movie before I went. I try to have a good idea of what I am in for. They were, for the most part, unnecessarily harsh. It is true that I, Robot pretty much borrowed ideas from every other major robot movie ever made to date, and recycled them. From the question of the dreams of robots (Hello?!? The subtitle of Blade Runner is "Do robots dream of electric sheep?") to the idea of a cop that is part robot part human (Robocop)&nbsp; and the list gets longer. The movie even borrowed the robot transport devices from the first Star Wars prequel. Does the movie accomplish new goals with old material. I don't think so. Several references within script are made that mention the paranoia of the character and his unbalanced psyche. Not enough is done with this. We never think he's paranoid because we see all of the action happening. A great sense of suspense and question of reality could have been drawn if perhaps they had worked the concepts a little differently. I like the idea that the experiences Spooner (Smith's character) is having (or believes he is having) are seen by the audience as the dreams Sonny is having. Or something like that. I mean the man who wrote A Beatiful Mind, and sold that story and its twists so amazingly, worked on the script for I, Robot. A better&nbsp;product should have come out.&nbsp; &nbsp; Who is this Sonny? The robot that is unique. With a voice that sounds alot like Hal 9000 from 2001: Space Odessey, he is the best character put forth by the movie. Perhaps the only character, other than the cat that appears briefly, for which I&nbsp;really cared about. For me, it is a telling sign of the success of the movie what kind of bond the characters create with the audience. That is lacking for this movie. Although, a Will Smith shower scene did create a bond of a sort for my mother as she watched the movie in the next seat over.  &nbsp; The Good: the cinematography, the roller coaster ride of camera shots, Smith actually put forward a decent acting job for this movie but there must have been something else...something more focused missing from the concept of the movie and the script that came out. Plus, I liked Spooner's interest in antique items from the turn of the 21st century era. Chucks, CD's, a motorcycle that runs on *gasp* gasoline. More&nbsp;Good: It was an excellent sell for an action flick. The action was well-handled, the camera work with the action was exciting, and the references to The Matrix that I kept seeing&nbsp;were kind&nbsp;of&nbsp;entertaining. I usually enjoy self referencing cinema or homages put into a movie...except when they replace the movie itself.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Bad: my hubby had problems with the computer graphic/human actor integration. He cites the scene where Spooner is running through rows of robots in storage and doesnt physically react to the confines of that environment. It's like he doesnt&nbsp; know he running through narrow spaces. Plus, there is a time when the female lead who plays a brilliant robot scientist is circling a chair in which Sonny is sitting and there are cords on the ground...my hubby noted that she didnt step over anything...just walked around in a circle. It seems the director didnt tell these actors what was in the environments they were working with in blue screen, or at least he didnt instruct them to react to it. More bad: who was the young street punk kid, and why is he important? 2035??? Come on people...that's not that far away! It seems a little far fetched to set it so close to our current time with all of the technological advances that were shown as having been&nbsp;made.  &nbsp; The Ugly:&nbsp;the utter&nbsp;lack of creativity that went into this movie.&nbsp;&nbsp;And an ending that backs away from bringing any further information or ideas into the concept of the movie. &nbsp; Overall:&nbsp;This movie is still watchable and my mother enjoyed it despite its downfalls. So, there is certainly a percentage of the movie audience that will get a kick out of it.&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;I, Robot&nbsp;was better than I expected, but still not great. And when it comes down to it, there is little resemblance of the movie to Asimov's work. I think they just borrowed the characters. This is a matinee flick, with popcorn and a drink. Catch it in the theatres if you are into sci fi at all, but you can wait for it on video if its not your usual genre of choice. &nbsp; That's all the news in fits of print -  &nbsp; Mack B.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      An occasional Thursday here and there my mother-in-law plays cards with a bunch of "Ladies" for whom she has been cooking like a mad woman. My father-in-law has groused daily this week about there being no dessert. The fact that desserts are stacked three-fold in the refridgerator made especially for "the ladies" doesnt make it any easier to take that his wife couldnt be bothered with making or buying something sweet for him to eat this week. He seems genuinely hurt - really about as effected as he is about losing at the racetrack. Every night he has asked about the sweets, and everynight he gets the same reply, "There are ice cream bars in the freezer." The problem is that there aren't really any ice cream bars at all. There are popscicles and fudgescicles. A huge difference to a picky sweet tooth. I thought after his obvious disappointment Tuesday that my MIL would throw a tray of brownies in or something. No such luck for my FIL.   Ah, but the Ladies have a feast fit for queens coming to them. Trust me, these biddies get the royal treatment. My MIL feels she has a "reputation" and has set standards for what her coven of crones expect at these galas. And after all, the other grey-hairs host at their houses when cards are not played here. There is, I sense, an air of competition. The house has been made spotless, the matching set of card tables has appeared, my FIL's chair in the living room has been moved. Now, this I would think would be war. But, it is the usual way of things when the ladies are coming. Move over man of the house, a herd of biddies is arriving! I feel like I should set up some kind of system with doilies or something to alert the masses. "One if by land, two if by sea! The Ladies are coming, the Ladies are coming!" *starts to look for signal doilies* *remembers i have no such frou frou* *gives up on the doily effort, for now*  The most irritating aspects about all of this card-playing preparation have been two fold: 1) I have been told that I am not to stick my nose beyond the borders of the basement if I am to stay home this evening. Plus, my husband has to work tonight or else we could escape the in coming insanity of Red Hat Club trainees. 2) Perhaps most annoying is that my MIL bowls on Thursdays, she just left for the lanes. But she refused to pre-bowl or do anything else to ease her busy day or week. She has been complaining incessantly about Thursday all week. It has driven me to the ends of my wits and back again. If she's not willing to pre-bowl or cancel then she really has no right to complain that she had no time today to do anything, and that she's been cooking all week. I want to remind her that she could have bought stuff instead of making it, or have the event catered - but I know better than to say such a thing to this homemaker. She says she hass been cooking all week, but we really havent had much in the way of dinner and every time I have seen her shes cross-stitching or watching TV. Worst though is that her brand of complaining is nasal, with a touch of her native New Jersey accent. The very sound of her irritation makes me want to claw the walls down around me.  The kicker is that my in-laws are going out of town this Saturday for a week. This means that my MIL has cooked this tremendous amount of food "all week", and there will be a ton left over. And they will be gone. My FIL will likely get only one or two pieces of that chocolate cake he has been eyeing in the fridge. My husband and I will get to ravage the spoils of card table leftovers in the wake of the absent inlaws. I too have been eyeing that chocolate cake.   I am thankful they will be gone for a whole week. A week of peace. How nice that will be. No flicking of the lights on and off, beckoning us to their chores, showing us how co-dependent they have become on our existence. I think they have no clue how difficult some aspects of their life will be once we move out. Their computer or internet might hiccup and they will panic. *sigh* Of course, my MIL will not have to cook as much, which may be some relief to her. But from my understanding of this week - she doesnt like to cook, but takes alot of pride in her cooking nonetheless. She complains about the kitchen and the cooking, but wouldnt close down her home food service for anything.  In the meantime, I do my best to appreciate the mostly bland food we get served - and try not to use the pepper to viciously. She always says "try it before you spice it" and then when I do she says "what there isnt enough pepper in it for you?" A pepper catch 22. My MIL is also anti-garlic...which as made the past 3 months challenging to my pallet to say the least. I am looking forward to eating food with flavor and that hasnt been doused in margarine to boot. Perhaps her biddies think shes a good cook, but her no-fat, low-fat, substituted, flavorless food is not appealing to me. If she's that concerned about the fat and sugar content in foods, then its time to change eating expectancies and habits not substitute the flavor out of the food. I know, I shouldnt complain...its free food. And I don't complain to her. I complain here. On my anonymous little blogspace in the blogosphere.  But in other news...  Check out this link: http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3682  The link posted here attaches to an article about the effect of political blogs. While I hardly consider myself a political blog, or a pundit, not even a political idiot savant...I still think its interesting the effect of this independent publishing exercise of blogging has had on the larger industry of journalism. This is a unique little story reporting on some of the major blogs and their effects on journalism and the manner in which these blogs have flowed into the mainstream. Plus, my loyal blog readers know about my enjoyment of blogging about blogs in my blog. The nature of the catch-22/infinitous/twilight zoniness of the study keeps me looking for news about blogs. Plus, it makes me feel semi connected with the larger entity of the blogosphere. Although I have to say that I wish I knew something about HTML so that I could do something more extraordinary with my blog.  Giving me fits of laughter in print:   In top headlines today these headlines appeared next to each other:  Gay Marriage Opponents Pin Hopes on House  'Angels in America' Leads Emmy Nominations  Do the people of America need a more clear sign that their elected officials are not representing them? The Emmy's are not the bastion of culture. They are about entertainment. Only shows with decent ratings even get recognized.  Maybe our Senators and members of the house will see the sign. It's a sign that America has come a far way in homosexual equality as a culture and we dont want to take any backwards steps - even if the society at large is not yet prepared for the ultimate forward steps.   I say bring it on. I am ready. I have been ready. I will be very happy when gay marriage and gay adoption are approved and when sexual preference joins the list of protected stats such as age, race, gender...and when it makes it to the UN war crimes documentation as well. It will be a glorius day and a great step forward for the world. I know I shall live to see it, but I also know I must wait a wee bit longer.  My dizziness is starting to wear off again a bit. I am having huge troubles sleeping so that doesnt help my state much. My hubby is complaining of a sore throat and sneezing today...I am a little worried he's come down with a cold. He's in denial - wont stop at the drug store on the way home to grab anything to boot. He says that would be a sort of admission that he is sick or something, and he says that he doesnt want to give the germs something to rally around. *blink blink* Riiiight, welcome to the mind of a man who refuses to be sick.  Warning up upcoming news event: It is 29 days until the Olympics in Athens, Greece. I have to warn my blog readers that I am an Olympiholic. I love the Olympics and will likely cover the events in my blog to a certain extent. Now, most of my readers are international, believe it or not. And I am making a statement at this point in time to let you know that I will not mean to slant my coverage about the Olympics in an ethnocentric manner. The UK and Canadian teams are of interest to me in every way...in the same way that any other team or individual Olympian is fascinating. BUT I have to deal with the US Press coverage of the events, and NBC's choices of which Olympians are the one's to watch or at least who deserves the little background story videos and whatnot. SOOOOO I have to cover what I can and what I am presented with. Many events may be shown but the US press always emphasizes the US athletes unless for example there are none after eliminations. But then that event doesnt usually get much coverage. I just wanted to warn my readers, and let them know that I do not get taken over by fits of patriotism just due to 16 days of glory. I root for the underdogs, the people whose performances deserve recognition, and the athletes with the skills and luck to out perform the others. I actually hope that the US gets beat in various events. I mean, big shock, athletes with priveleges and expensive sports facilities win! I would rather the kid that practiced in rags and ran barefoot get the gold. Show the USA that it takes more than money to succeed. Right, well be forewarned I will turn into a punk version of a Bob Costas cohost in a few days. I hope that it might get you to tune into the Olympics yourself once in a while.  That's all the news in fits of print for the moment!  --Mack

       urlLink    Really the last Emerson Drive 07/14/04 Photo Posting: I realized that I had mentioned this photo in another caption, but for some reason it didn't get loaded among the mass of Emerson Drive pop culture photo art. This is the sharpie fan image of the keyboardist. This photo was taken during a quiet moment at the meet and greet. Its obvious no one told him not to sniff his markers. But for the record he really has the marker clipped to his lip or something. He doesnt REALLY sniff markers...or if he does I would have no idea of it, and this picture could in no way provide proof. I just thought this image was fun, and showed a more personal side to the guys...goofy sharpie geeks. Just like many of my friends, and most of the members of various bands I have known. Enjoy this spontaneous moment of boyish fun for what it is and do not by any means abuse this picture or its intent. It's nice to see the "normal" side of people (we all do odd things with pens that include mounting them behind our ears, to chewing the cap to shreds, to clicking them insescently, to clipping them to about anything...) And just remember any ED fans out there...that pen is what he uses to sign your autographs....so if you would rather make something out of my fun piccy than get autographs than that would be your error to make. Oh and I should make the disclaimer that while I enjoy the stage show these guys put on immensly I am not categorically a "fan." I like the roots and concept of country music more than I like most of the results. These guys are well trained and talented musicians, who could succeed in any genre they would choose. I have a hard time calling them strictly country. Since I am not a "fan" these photos are not meant as promotion...more as a study of me and my camera and whatever photographic skills that may or may not be unleashed. With that disclaimer firmly in place: If you are a fan site DO NOT use my photos. This is me, giving you non-permission to copy and paste any photo on this website for any public use whatsoever. Do not post them on your website, or another. Do not email them to your friends. This is my work, my time, my camera, and my right.  Don't make me call my lawyer, I mean he's a good guy and all but he always wants to go have lunch meetings at greasy spoons. And then he takes his gas to court. Ug. So be respectful of the guys and of my art. Or prepare to "Eat at Joe's" with an ex-senator.&nbsp; urlLink

      First note: This blog is written backwards. The stuff at the end was written first and it moves more and more current as you get to the first paragraph which is current to today. That’s okay because the stuff at the end are the movie reviews anyways.  My vertigo is returning. I was feeling better over the weekend and now….Well now I feel like a whirling dervish on a lunch break, I suppose. I can’t help but think that the concert I went to last night is the cause. It was so LOUD where we were sitting that my hair was vibrating. It must have shaken up my inner ear – physically as well as task-wise. Well, I had to call off again today, and that means that I will be done for the working for the Y this summer.  It seems extreme doesn’t it…well read on below.  I had to fight tooth and nail to keep my job last Friday, and I won. I had to fight the battle because they wanted to fire me due to the fact that I had taken vacation for a week earlier this summer and called off three days. My supervisor had the gall to mention that I took vacation and didn’t leave town. I pointed out to him that if he checked the vacation request form, that I had asked for a week and a half off and only taken a week for that very reason. And I reminded him that it was not any of his business where I went for my vacation. I also noted that I told him about the vacation BEFORE he hired me. I knew it was against YMCA policy to fire people for such reasons, so I took it to my supervisor’s supervisor aka: the head of childcare. I was allowed to return to my job Monday. But could not come back on Tuesday. So it turns out that my hard work was for nothing.  I won the battle but not the war in my attempt to stay employed and I was told that if I called off again – be it for viral illness that I have no control over or not - I was gone. Here I am a self-fulfilling prophesy in Murphy’s Law or the dark side of irony, I suppose.   I was taken off the sign-in /sign-out book after last week– which wasn’t a big deal I would rather be with the kids anyways. But it meant that I couldn’t go to work at all today. If I would have known that all I was doing is sitting around I would have suffered through it – just to keep my job. But I am (was) back to running around helping the art supplies person and kids and everything…so there is no stillness in my work time. Was. There was to be no stillness in my work time. I am heart broken over losing this job. I feel like a failure in some ways. I have given my last year and a half to the YMCA, working there in some way most of that time. My only reference in my recent years, and yet it’s going out the window. Today has more or less undone all of my hard work. I am a weak link in the chain and I don’t want to be.  But I have to get my health together, and that is my first priority. Enough moping and introspection – I have plenty of time for that later.  Monday night we saw Emerson Drive perform again. It was the third time we had seen them … or fourth. My husband’s radio station ran the show last night and intro’ed the boys twice. I got some great pictures during the show, and at the meet and greet in between their two shows. It was a nice night really. Bonus: they totally remembered me and signing my Gameboy last summer. HA! Plus, they were interested in getting emailed some of the pics that I had taken. My photography career is up and running…er, yeah. Now, it must be said that I am not a big country music person. I wouldnt consider myself a "fan" if you will, but I do have appreaciation for some of the musicians and the genre of music in and of itself. With that disclaimer I really have appreciation for Emerson Drive. They are awesome musicians who love what they do. They incorporate various genres into their music, and I am sorry I cant consider them redneck country since they are from Canada. Their Canadianess makes them that much cooler. Right well then, I will post the pics soon from their show.  I also have fish pics to post don’t I…those are on my hubby’s cpu…I will have to roust them out later as well.  I have been reading news the last few days about a planned terror attack by the al-quaida on the US during our elections. I have to say that this Bush administration propagation of the threat of terror to disrupt our elections sounds like a scare tactic to get voters to stay home. HA! Well I hope it backfires on them and that they discover that Republicans are the only people spineless enough to stay at home instead of voting under the “credible threat” of a terror attack!!!! *pant pant pant* Something tells me that if the threat was truly credible that our CIA and FBI intelligence officials wouldn’t have heard of it. But that would be the cynic in me.  I also read about some small movie theatre chains in Illinois and Indiana refusing to show Fahrenheit 9/11 due to the fact that they see it as propaganda and they have an anti-propaganda policy. I hope that these two theatres do not advertise, nor advertise themselves before the movie in the previews and whatnot. Also I hope that they don’t run those commercials before the movies  - like the US Army ads in particular. Advertisement is just another form of propaganda…the difference is that most people think advertising is innocuous. It is funny to me where people will chose to draw their battle lines.  Ah, and Kerry finally announced (with no surprise to me) his VP as John Edwards. I saw that one coming. I also saw a photo on the front page of our local newspaper of Kerry and Edwards and couldn’t help but notice that Edwards looks a great deal like JFK in some ways. I think that voters that are easily swayed by the looks of a candidate might just be sold. Me? Well I think that a natural choice for the VP would be the runner-up in the primaries. It means that many people in the country supported the candidate and *conceptually* would then support another candidate with their choice on the ticket. He’s young, he’s a newbie, and what can I say – I think he will inject some charm and positivity into the Kerry campaign. Besides, with Edwards aboard it means that Kerry stands half a chance with voters in the South (apparently.)  This brings up something else that I have wondered about…voters in the South seem to worry about the New Englander point of view not reflecting theirs. I get this impression from news stories from sources such as the AP and whatnot that state as much. But people from California aren’t portrayed as worrying whether their western concerns will be met…and people from Nebraska aren’t portrayed as worrying that the candidate is not from the Midwest so they might not share their values….So what is it about the South? Well, is it a Civil War hangover? Is it the concept that they *know* they are a minority and that their views are not well reflected across the country as a whole? And why does the South have so much power anyway? So odd to see that a presidential candidacy might find lines drawn across regional perceptions or stereotypes.   Right, well then far too much (and quite enough) politics.   My husband and I came up with a sequel to White Chicks – or perhaps just an MTV Movie Awards bit. Tow-headed white girls that have to dress up as black men. Oh the casting fun!  With me sick and bored beyond belief my husband and I invested in a second Gameboy and bought the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game that has been out for quite a while. I love the technological conceptualizing that led to Nintendo to using their handheld systems as controllers. With an RPG this is very helpful. All of the menus that one needs to access are viewed on the GBA (Gameboy Advanced) instead of on the TV screen. Crystal Chronicles is also a multiplayer RPG which is an answer to my quiet little video game prayers. The graphics and animation are pretty, the story line is good, the levels are interesting and challenging, and the game provides new and more difficult concepts as it moves forward. The game integrates a lot of unique concepts and is a lot of fun! I suggest that any RPG hooked readers of my blog (You know who you are!!!) get away from the online RPG and into this socially interactive, real time game.   Okay, now for the movie review segment. It will be quick and dirty unlike my normal more involved reviews.  Around the World in 80 Days: Jackie Chan and some new faces and TONS of cameos. This is a decent comedy - it changes the original story a bit and still manages to remain entertaining due to the efforts of the actors. It is not a typical Jackie Chan movie, and for some people that might be its downfall. For me, I almost didn’t go see it as it is a Disney enterprise. Disney can ruin anything good – even Jackie Chan. Well it turns out that the only things Disney messed with were the animated traveling transitions and the credits. The animation was fine, the credits sucked. I do have to give Disney credit for resisting the urge to use “It’s a Small World After All” until the credits however.  The acting was better than expected, the scriptwriting was good enough, the actors did seem to work well together, and it was a group effort to get this movie to make it. The exception to this cast grouping was the actor who played Detective Fix – every time he came on screen the audience members felt the urge to cause him great amounts of pain, well at least I did.  80 Days is a popcorn matinee flick that still is a lot of fun, and probably better than the original movie made from the story. I guess I was spoiled by an extremely awesome stage version of “Around the World in 80 Days” that I saw in North Carolina a couple years ago. Four actors, a table and chairs, and little else other than costuming and some nice backgrounds and some sliding doors went into the play.  But yet the play was hilarious and sooooooo well acted, and the minimalism was more Shakespearian in feel than uber modern. But ah well, the “legitimate stage” wins again.   Dodgeball: Ben Stiller, Ben Stiller’s wife, the stapler dude from Office Space, Vince Vahgn, and more. This would be the first Ben Stiller movie that has been released this year that even looked like it was worth my time (little of all my money.) We went to see it late one night on our week of vacation and enjoyed it. We actually had to make two attempts to see the movie...the first attempt was foiled as we arrived 5 minutes after the showtime to find the movie theatre locked and the employees insisting they could not sell us tickets. I checked with a manager the next day...the theatre is supposed to stay open for 45 minutes after the last showtime. Oops. The naughty, lazy employees got caught. But back to the movie!  Perhaps we enjoyed it more for the semi-nostalgic, semi-nerdboy dodgeball theme than for any other reason.  Ben Stiller’s wife stole the movie as far as the acting goes. She was an utter scene stealer. One of the funniest parts of the whole movie is after the credits so make sure to sit through them. I read a couple of movie review columnists opinion about the Ben Stiller-a-thon that seems to be going on this year. I have to agree with them that the more prolific Stiller gets, the worse off his audience is going to be. But, Dodgeball may be his one in five that works. Who knows.  This is once again a goofy popcorn flick that if you have just had a financial windfall might be worth a night ticket, but is more likely a matinee.  Terminal: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta Jones. This was a great great great (Do I see an Oscar nomination?) flick! Tom did a great job playing an Eastern Bloc Nation immigrant with a mission. The concept of a nowhere man has never quite been so endearing. The writing was witty and charming, the other characters were well done, the world of the airport was well formulated, the presentation of the homeland security types was entertaining and perhaps enlightening. Plus, an audience member you really "fall in love" with Tom Hank’s character to a certain extent. Catherine Zeta Jones did not add much to this movie, and a relative newcomer might have been a better casting choice. The pacing of the movie was slow at times but I think that was intentional to give the audience the feeling of waiting such that the main character felt. This is one of those movies that is practically universal in its appeal. I recommend seeing this movie, evening show with popcorn, candy, and soda – because it is just worth it.  Stepford Wives: Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Bette Midler This movie was a new more modern take on the old movie and the original book which both movies were supposedly based on. Both movies sooooo missed the point. In the book the suburban men kill their wives, in the first movie the director used this angle to turn the flick into a horror movie. In the new version no one dies, but rather they get transformed into robots – more or less because of a chip in their brain. But the movie still could have made a statement of some kind, or come up with some concept to address…but no! The movie backed away from making a point and stayed in the “slightly entertaining only” realm. I always thought Fozzie Bear had a spine. But I guess Frank Oz might be waning in his olden days. The ending really backs away from making a point other than perhaps the “it’s not men oppressing women, it’s women oppressing each other” idea that has only been bounced around in post-feminist circles that bow to Martha Stewart. Go see this movie only if you are a campy Midler fan or want to see how the gay couple issue is tackled in this updated Stepford stepchild. Its matinee quality with candy sneaked in from the drugstore.  Spiderman II: Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina Quite an enjoyable romp in the nature of superhero-dum. I liked this better than the first Spiderman – and other than Mary Jane’s too red hair I had no complaints about the first one either. The special effects are a given for Spiderman, as were the cameo appearances by Bruce Campbell (Bubba HoTep) and Stan Lee. Miss Dunst turned in another great performance as did Mr. Maguire. It was Alfred Molina who stole this movie however. His great handling of Doctor Octopus puts into perspective why Spiderman has really been the biggest hit of the comic book movie genre. The acting. It probably doesn’t hurt that the writer is the creator of the comic, or that the director is a complete comic book nerd…But it is really the great acting that keeps the Spiderman movies afloat instead of sinking to the middle or the bottom with most of the other comic book based movies. Not only are the actors of great caliber…they put all of their acting chops into their roles. It’s not a parody of a hero, its not just the surface of their skills. I guess Sam Raimi (the director) can be credited with helping the actors buy into what they are doing, and go all out. The good: MJ’s hair is a natural shade of red this time, Doc Oc makes everything more important…he’s an evil villain with clear motivation and most importantly he’s not really evil at all – that’s the selling point. More of the good: Spiderman’s unmasking. Oh yeah. It was time for it to happen. The Bad: The newspaper editor’s reaction change from “Spiderman saved my son’s fiancée!!!” to “He’s evil” in the span of 2.5 seconds with little motivation. I didn’t buy it. Neither will most of the rest of the audience. This might be part actor problem and part script…but either way it sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise seamless movie. The Ugly: The Green Goblin looks set for a comeback. I think it will pull the whole Spidey movie enterprise beyond the boundaries of Emerald City. But, with the writer of the comic book writing the movies, sticking with the truth of the time line of the comics will come into play. I guess it’s fate. Ick.  Overall: Worth evening tickets…worth paying for evening tickets for your whole family with popcorn and the whole nine yards. Go see this.    King Arthur: A Jerry Bruckheimer production starring Keira Knightly and Clive Owen. A little disclaimer at the beginning explains that recent archeological evidence gives new light to King Arthur's legend moving it from the Middle Ages to the Dark Ages and that this movie is showing you that Dark Ages legend. Blame it on the history channel special about this very subject (sponsored by the movie to boot) that makes me cough a *bullshit* at this notation. Right, well I wont harp on historical/archeological/what is known thus far and the innacuracies any further because despite the annoyance of a few of these issues I still enjoyed the movie.  I have read reviews about it in a few places that had less than kind things to say. It seems Jerry Bruckheimer has quite a reputation and not many friends. People are already poo-pooing his version of Phantom of the Opera that is due out in theatres at around Christmastime or so. Maybe I am the last person to be told why this is the case. I liked Pirates of the Carribean! But onto the movie at hand.  The Good: The knights were great characters, and I liked the backstory created for them as to why they were serving the Roman empire. I liked the ideals of Arthur seen as born from belief in a cause and in a government that he doesnt realize no longer exists - rather than just an idealistic man for no apparent reason. This Arthur has motivation for his ideals, and an example set for him. I enjoyed Kiera Knightly's performance...even if it took on Lady MacBeth overtones at times. Machiavelli would be proud of her Guinevere. It is interesting the way they handled the whole Lancelot issue...especially since Lancelot as part of the story of King Arthur is a French invention...of the Middle Ages... So, I think its a unique perspective the way Lancelot is handled (no spoilers since its still in the theatres...) The ice battle scene is very suspenseful and well handled. Its creative and even gives some more insight to war and battle strategy of that time.  The Guinevere seduction scene reminds me of the Morgana/Morgain seduction of Arthur of some literary sources that were transformed into film via Excalibur in 1981. Right, well the scenes resemble each other. This I find interesting. Perhaps it is a nod to a movie that made Arthur popular again? The Bad: The lack of explanation behind who the Saxons were or why they were invading. One sided villains suck. Some of the varying accents among peoples who were *supposed* to be the same heritage was a little irritating. Why were the Woads the only ones to speak a different language? In reality none of the characters would have spoken English. ENGLISH DIDNT EXIST YET. Right so I am harping on historical stuff again...sorry. But the inconsistency that the Woads/Picts were the only ones that didnt speak the uniform language was ANNOYING. Not enough was done with Merlin. He was not mysterious nor mystic at all - even if they didnt want to show a magical world but rather a real world....he still could have been "mystical" - and his character wasnt developed in the least to boot. Maybe thats because in all of the historical data they found thus far there is no proof of Merlin? Then why is he in the movie? He moves no plot devices nor elements than another character could have equally done. Right. Well that character gripe tied into historical stuff...sorry.  Maybe a movie shouldn't state that its based on new archeological evidence...unless it really is. And thats the Ugly. The statement at the beginning is all well and good, but this movie is not a historical dramatisation. Bruckheimer's version is another fictionalized re-telling of the legend, it just happens to come from and older source that could be more accurate if the legend has any truth to it at all.  It is still a good work and, as I said, I enjoyed watching it. But the preamble to the movie...made the experience more of a "catch the historical innacuracies" game than it would have been if it had presented itself more as fictitious. Overall: Matinee fodder, unless you have a good date - because then it might be worth a night ticket. A little chivalrous reinforcement of loyalty never hurt anyone too much. If you go at night, skip the popcorn.  Fahrenheit 9/11: Made by Michael Moore I had been waiting for this movie for quite a while now. Thank god he came through and made it, and thank god again that the Weinstein’s know a hit when they see one. This movie is the documentary film genre at it’s best. Entertaining, shocking, maddening, inducing squeamishness, and making sure that when you leave the theatre you come out a different version of yourself than when you went in. It’s hard not to have an emotional response to this movie. Most people who read this blog know what it is about but just in case: Moore explores the Arab business and family contacts that G.W. Bush and company are tied to. Moore further looks at these relationships in relationship to 9/11, the attacks on Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq. Moore also spends some time wading back through the 2000 election….reminding me of one of the reasons I am not “proud to be an American.” A democracy should never mean a court decides who is president. Whatever happened to checks and balances? I don’t think the Constitution intends this country to have court appointed presidencies. At any rate, Moore takes a look at soldiers in Iraq, the people in Iraq, the US statesmen, and some everyday ordinary US citizens that are parents of US soldiers in Iraq.  The Good: A movie that engages the grey matter between our ears…YAY! Having seen all of Michael Moore’s documentary films, this one involves seeing or hearing Michael Moore less during the interviews. He could be seen to have to lead interviews where he wanted them to go – I can’t help but think of the Charleton Heston or Marilyn Manson interviews in “Bowling for Columbine” as examples of this. However in this movie and these interviews – he lets his subjects do the talking. They guide the conversation and make their own points…which it could be said then that it seems like Michael Moore is bringing the opinions that many people hold and border on holding to the forefront - rather than simply promoting his own opinions.  Also, Moore’s use of music and comic relief are excellent. I like the little subtitle footnotes and his narration. The Ice Cream truck stunt was impressive. I laud the people who put their necks on the lines for standing up for their beliefs and appearing in this movie. The Bad: Ummmm……*Tries to be the slightest bit Subjective* Hell, this is a review on my blog…I don’t have to be subjective!!!! The Ugly: President Bush sitting in a Florida classroom 9/11/01 reading a book about a goat, until someone else told him it was time to do something about the terrorist attacks that just happened. Overall: Good enough to spending evening prices, and pay for your whole neighborhood to boot. Popcorn all around.   Rentals Segment:  The Producers: Mel Brooks brainchild that put him on the map of satire starring Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel. The movie wasn’t great, and I am not just saying that because I don’t like Gene Wilder…I am saying that because the comic timing seemed off, the acting was hammier than need be, and while the musical numbers in the play within the play, er, movie were hilarious…(Springtime for Hitler, indeed) they still couldn’t hold the entire movie up on a musical stretcher to cross the finishing line. The Broadway stage version has gotten rave reviews with Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick at the helm and there is a remake of the movie due out next year starring Lane and Broderick.  The Good: Excellent satire fodder, even if it comes up short. The Bad: Too much to recount. The Ugly: Zero Mostel’s comb-over. Overall: Wait for the new version to come out in the movies, or see it on Broadway…Don’t even use a library free rental for this one.  Flashdance: Jennifer Beals Ah the 80’s! I had never seen this movie surprisingly. But maybe that’s because I was six when it came out. There isn’t all that much of note about this 80’s classic. There is cheesy choreography, stand-in dancing (a man danced Jennifer Beals difficult moves,) a transparent plot line, second class dirty dancing, and some costumes that make me wince. I have always liked the idea of and did enjoy the welding work and the side of the storyline that shows her as an iron worker. Plus, on an odd note, I kept wondering why the director seemed to think Beals looked better wet.  What is notable about this flick is the music. Now, most of the time these days if a song from a movie is a hit, it is because the movie was a hit and brought the song into the stage lights. Flashdance takes a dash of this idea and reverses it to boot. It uses music and songs that were popular at the time to beef up it’s soundtrack and help set the mood. This tactic had the effect of spreading the songs (and the idea of dancing to them) even further in the subconscious of Americans. It also used a song that was not well-known for the opening credits and within the movie. The association of this song with the others in the movie gave “What a Feeling” wings it would not have otherwise had.  The Good: The Music, the welding, Pittsburgh as the city it was filmed in. The Bad: Much of the dancing, the plot, the firing of Beals character so that she would go on a date with her boss. The Ugly: Beals soaking wet. The movie could have been titled Splashdance. Some of the choreography was beyond bad…it moved into the realm of downright ugly. So don’t say I didn’t warn you. Overall: Rent this if and only if you are absolutely craving your legwarmers.  The Saint: Roger Moore’s early TV success. The Saint is an interesting little trip in the TV Land history. The role of the Saint led directly to Moore’s casting as James Bond. In fact, he had to turn down the role the first time it was offered to him because of his commitments to The Saint. Thus, Sean Connery got a shot at Bond. The show is old, so don’t expect great effects, great locations, or even a lack of plot holes. (Why would Germans in the 1960’s be driving American cars???) Hmmm. There is some cheesy acting, and bad make-up moments. Moore having to fix his mussed hair after ever fight scene may annoy the snot out of you. Plus, they turn an ordinary white guy into a Middle Eastern character with some brown pan stick. Sad. Still, with all of the tv show's faults it’s hard not to fall for Moore’s debonair Saint. I guess the bonus is in the endings too…they usually have a twist of some kind that would have been somewhat new to audiences at that time. The Good: Young Roger Moore. The Bad: The Budget of the TV show. The Ugly: Lack of eye for detail among the show’s creators. Overall: Check this out at your local library if you can. I wouldn’t buy the DVD’s unless you are a super Moore fan or just a super Bond fan and want a piece of the history. It is your call whether to pay to rent them from a store or not.    BBC’s Sherlock Holmes: Starring Jeremy Brett as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous gumshoe of the title. I don’t have to say much about this series. It has critical acclaim left and right already – and it has been out for a while. I have seen most of the series previously and there are quite a few of Conan Doyle’s novels and short stories featured in the BBC series.  We rented The Hound of the Baskervilles – recalling me to the sleepless nights I sat up reading the book too enthralled to stop reading and too scared to go to sleep. I was in Junior High when I read the Complete Sherlock Holmes. I would say that Conan Doyles work had a profound effect on me.  These movie versions were very very well done. The BBC has always been known for their historical pieces, and the setting is so well handled in these productions that you might never catch an anachronism at all. Jeremy Brett was perfect casting for Holmes, and it might be unfair to say so but his rendering of the character has made all others since and before look pale in my eyes. (And believe me its harder to get more pasty than Mr. Brett!) If I see Sherlock Holmes portrayed – it’s Brett I expect to see.  Although, I must note that my hubby and I did catch a surprisingly good stage version of Sherlock Holmes at The Red Barn Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee. It was written by the director of the theatre and was an original play featuring Holmes and Watson. The Red Barn is a dinner theatre, so we had Watson as a waiter to boot. But back to the BBC version…some of the effects leave you wishing the BBC had a better budget – but the mood more than makes up for the low budget special effects. The Good: The perfect Holmes and Watson bring great literature to life. The Bad: The actual hound of title was not nearly what could be done today…The Ugly: The hound wins again. Overall: Rent these from your local library and curl up for a good mystery night!  TV Notes: The new season of Dead Like Me starts next week!!!!! Check it out on Showtime. Here's the official TV show website: http://www.deadlikeme.tv/index.php I was mistaken in earlier blogness to think this was an HBO production. Wrong I was! It's Showtime!  Okay, finally, I am caught up!!!! With no job, I don’t figure I will fall far behind again. But for now I am done…This was a long post. Thanks for the patience to read it loyal bloggers, and that’s all the news (and then some) in fits of print.  --Mack

      Why is balancing a checkbook such a trying task. In order to get the numbers in my checkbook registry to come to some logical conclusion I usually have to search my husbands pockets of everything he's worn for a week, turn our little basement area upside-down, log on to my checking account website two or three times, and inevitably redo half the math from the past week and half's purchases, twice. Ug. I work so hard to keep track of all of our purchases and the little columns of numbers. I never approach the checkbook without a calculator! Why cant an ordinary everyday task like that be simple? Because then it wouldn't be my life I suppose.  We picked peaches yesterday. Out of my mother's orchard I think I had my first time ever in my life experience of picking real edible fruit from the tree it grew on, wiping it off a bit, and taking a bite. I got some nice snapshots too. I will post those when I get a chance.  My life...well it seems to be a little off kilter at the moment. I am going back to the YMCA just to work out starting next week. I feel a little wimpy for admitting I am a little nervous about even stepping foot on the YMCA grounds. After I got fired, fought for my job, then had a relapse of my virus and lost my hard won job due to having to call off again...I feel I guess a little ashamed. I am still a member and I have the right to use the facility. And some evening sometime in the next few months I am going to have to go to the office I used to work in and raid the CPU I used to use for copies of my work so that I can have it for my portfolio...and that will take a fair amount of time really. So I am going to have to suck it up. I cant let a little trepidation of seeing my old boss keep me from my health. I am a little disappointed in myself for feeling so cowardly. I did nothing wrong. I didnt deserve to be treated the way I was treated. I was a good counselor. I did my job well with no complaints....My confidence was admittedly shaken with the events surrounding my firing...But I still did nothing wrong....I hope that sinks in soon.  Observations on the human condition: Well, the cable guy came out today to check out the cable connection at this house for the third time since we have even lived here at all...and the like 10th time total in the last 2 years. He says there is electricity running over the cable line which has likely been causing the problems that we have been experiencing with the internet zapping in and out and moving slower than molasses. While I talked to him when he was here, and displayed a certain knowledgeableness about the subject and cable and electrical wiring...the cable guy still insisted on calling my husband to talk to him when all was said and done. *sigh* Sexism lives on.  My Dad sent me the following in my email....  ITS TIME TO REEVALUATE OUR INVOLVEMENT  Every day there are news reports about more deaths.   &nbsp; Every night on TVthere are photos of death and destruction. Why are we still there?  &nbsp; We occupied this land, which we had to take by force, but it causes usnothing but trouble.   &nbsp; Why are we still there? Many of our children go there and never come back. Why are we still there?  &nbsp; Their government is unstable, and they have sporadic leadership. Why are we still there?  &nbsp; Many of their people are uncivilized. Why are we still there?   &nbsp; The place is subject to natural disasters, from which we are supposed tobail them out. Why are we still there?  &nbsp; There are more than 1,000 religious sects, which we do not understand. Why are we still there?  &nbsp; Their folkways, foods, and fads are unfathomable to ordinary Americans. Why are we still there?  &nbsp; We can't even secure the borders. Why are we still there?   &nbsp; They are billions of dollars in debt, and it will cost billions more to rebuild, which we can't afford. Why are we still there?   &nbsp; It is becoming clear...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; WE MUST PULL OUT OF CALIFORNIA   I just about died laughing when I read the above email from my Dad. HA!   In the "real" news:  The house approved a bill that would not allow federal courts to force states to recognize gay marriages that are approved in other states but not the state in question. This, if it would pass, would essentially cut the Supreme Court out of the loop of checks and balances and prohibit people from using the court system as it is designed to be used with the ability to appeal to higher courts. The bill is not expected to live through time in the Senate...but I think its a mite bit rediculous the House is so desperate to prevent gay marriage that they are actually slashing at some of the basic lifelines of the Constitution and Democratic process.  Shocking News! Joan and Melissa Rivers will not be at the Emmy Award's Red Carpet! It's a break of tradition! It's the end of the world! This is considered news???? Apparently the Rivers' ladies are leaving E! TV for more money at the TV Guide channel but E! hold the official Red Carpet rights. Besides, I didn't think the name Rivers meant all that much these days. Shes hardly truely&nbsp;scathing, and hardly fashionable herself. Ah, well.  Rented Movie Reviews:  Stuck On You: Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear Okay first question - why does Greg Kinnear get comedy roles? Anyways - this movie was fun and we enjoyed it for the most part. It certainly made us laugh at times even if it was far fetched and rediculous at times. The Farrelly Brothers must be scraping the bottom of the barrel. After watching the blooper/outtake real we saw that Fox must have given the film a hard time about wasting film. Damon and Kinnear took this to heart - and it is obvious from the outtakes that they thought the movie in and of itself might be a waste of film. Damon at one point even says something like, "I have no respect for the scriptwriters of this movie." Woah. Harsh. But knowing the actors knew how rediculous they were being made the movie even better in retrospect. The Premise: Conjoined twins share a liver and grow up cooperatively and share all experiences...even when they may or may not share the talent or interest in it. The Good: Erm...the impressions....Matt Damon in general gave this movie his college try...and his acting gave it a bit more presence than it would have otherwise netted. The makeup and costuming of the conjoining - this was interesting and I am sure posed some challenges. There were definitely funny moments and comedic value to this movie...I guess the question is was it worth a whole movie of it? The Bad: Some of the cameos...Cher in general. It's sad when one of my favorite moments of the movie is the song and dance number from the musical version of Bonnie and Clyde. The Ugly: Did I mention Cher? Overall: Rent this if you need a good laugh...and have seen all of the other better funny movies too many times.  Perfect Score: Scarlett Johansson, an NBA star, the kid who played Vladamir in "Camp", Mathew Lillard and other sundry youthful cast members. The Premise: A gaggle of high schoolers with different backgrounds, talents, and reasons all need to retake (or take) the SAT and ace it. They decided that since the system is slanted against them by attempting to flatten the playing field and ignoring the individuality of the students they will break into the building that houses the offices and steal the answers to the next SAT exam. The Good: Johansson cant go wrong even when dealing with skimming the top movies like this one. I mean, even though the movie comes around to a sort of relevation of the inner worth of the individual and whatnot at the end its still no "Lost in Translation." Other goods, it referenced Breakfast Club...which I thought was kind of ballsy and funny. The movie is aware of its genre and pidgeonholes, and on that note - it tries to break the stereotypes of everyone involved a little. That is somewhat refreshing. I liked the narrator of the movie, and I found his character to be one of the best written ones. I also liked the running gag about figuring out what SAT stands for. Saturday AM Torture  All in all - my husband and I both still enjoyed this movie (and neither of us got too terribly bored during it) but "Cheaters" which has a similar theme might be a little better, and more realistic in dealing with consequences. Rent This with Cheaters for a double feature.   Soon-to-Come Reviews: Win a Date With Tad Hamilton (Rented), Catwoman, and The Bourne Supremacy.  That's all the news in fits of print...for now.  --Mack

      On Sunday,&nbsp;my husband and I&nbsp;were on our way to the pharmacy driving down the normal right side of the road when someone decided he is going to pass everyone on the left by using the shared left turn lane. I blast the horn as the other car zooms by. It's stupid and dangerous and illegal to use the left turn lane for passing - and very impatient. I honked more as a warning to other cars up the line that something was out of the ordinary and to take a look around. Not to just be obnoxious. Well the passenger in the passing car made a vague attempt at flipping me off - he got halfway there. Now, I was not offended by the motion but rather by the context...I mean hello?!?!?! If your the one pulling stupid driver tricks you have to expect others are not going to appreciate it and may give you some feedback. Flipping off people for pointing out that what you are doing is illegal and dangerous is not rebellious, the bird then simply becomes a sign of ignorance.  &nbsp; Once we got to the stoplight to turn left to get to the pharmacy, I looked over at the car to my right - and guess who it was??? The person who was in such a hurry they risked the safety of several vehicles to pass go no further ahead than myself. Doubt that will teach them a lesson, but it makes me wonder - why do people like that exist if not to prove Sarte right? Hell just might be other people.   The week in an empty house is going lovely so far. I can stay up until when I like and get up as late as I like and vary my schedule day to day as to when I sleep or wake without hearing, "you need to get on a schedule" or just getting the evil eye. We can have dinner (or not have dinner) whenever we want to...and not precisely at 4:45 every day. I can walk around the house in my PJs, or in whatever I want really, and perhaps most importantly - our cat has free reign! The basement kitty gets to roam the house and exercise his free will for a change. It makes him so much easier to live with.   We have rented several movies, most of which I will comment on at least a little....not all of them are worth a full out review. One of those unworthy is Cody Banks 2. See if you wanna play a cinematic&nbsp;quiz game of all the familiar looking adult actors, or just for the moment toward the end when one of the other kids (who plays a musician &amp;&nbsp;whose character&nbsp;comes from some kind of Eastern Bloc nation) breaks into James Brown. It made me roll over laughing and my husband even lost it (he was working very hard at looking like he was NOT enjoying the movie under any circumstance.) If you have to see Cody Banks 2 then this moment at the end makes it all worthwhile.   My husband has been playing hours of Front Mission Four. (A video game&nbsp;featuring giant robots that are piloted by characters and loaded to the gills with weapons...Plus, it actually has an interesting plot line to boot.)&nbsp;He loves it! Oh, did I mention we finally got a PS2? My hubby has been very patient in his wait for one of these new generation video game consoles. We decided the hours of entertainment it would provide was worth the money. Besides, he was going to get one for his birthday...now he just got it earlier. That will be the last and only big purchase however. Back to the budget again...   In the "real news":   Arnold Schwarzenneger gets called out for calling Democrat Congressmen "girlie men" for&nbsp;holding up&nbsp;the budget in CA, and one of the Republican Congressmen&nbsp;responded that reviving the SNL weight lifter skit line was not a good idea - after all liberals dont have a sense of humor. HA! I think the statement that liberals have no sense of humor is funny. But I think in this case context is everything. Perhaps if Arnie had said "As they say on SNL...blah blah blah" it would have gone over better. The gay community is taking affront to the language, and so are the liberals with no sense of humor.  &nbsp; Bonus:&nbsp;Arnold and my mother share a birthday - though I am not sure of the year. And did you know Arnold's dad was a Nazi Stormtrooper? I didnt know that. News to me.   This just in:  &nbsp;  urlLink http://entertainment.excite.com/article/id/415918entertainment07-19-2004::19:06reuters.html   &nbsp;  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - 'Singer Linda Ronstadt was thrown out of the Aladdin casino in Las Vegas on the weekend after dedicating a song to liberal film maker Michael Moore and his movie "Fahrenheit 9/11," a casino spokeswoman said on Monday.  Ronstadt, who had been hired for a one-show engagement Saturday night at the Las Vegas Strip casino, dedicated a performance of "Desperado" to Moore and his controversial documentary, which criticizes President Bush and the U.S.-led war in Iraq.'   Wow, freedom of speech has a short leash, does it not? I hope Michael Moore was there to catch the whole thing on his camera. I can't believe people rioted over a song dedication but odds are these self same people are unlikely to have voted in the last presidential election. Even if they did, and if they did they obviously voted for Bush, why waste their energy on a flailing, has-been, 80's icon? Then again the publicity from all of this could make Linda's career come back to life.  &nbsp; But what I still dont get is why would it upset a crowd so much that she dedicated a song to Michael Moore? I mean its not like she dedicated a song to a serial killer or pedophile. Gimme a break! The Alladin will never get my business in Vegas - not that I have ever really been to Vegas...and its not on my top ten list but still..... I am sure that the attendees of the concert felt that Free Speech is all well and good until they paid to hear it. But the word free in the phrase Free Speech has nothing to do with funding. Someone should tell the conservatives that.   But it does seem that&nbsp;Ronstadt&nbsp;may have pushed the buttons of &nbsp;the audience&nbsp;intentionally...the rest of the Reuters story goes like this:   'Before her concert, Ronstadt had laughingly told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that she hoped that the casino performance would be her last.  "I keep hoping that if I'm annoying enough to them, they won't hire me back," she was quoted as telling the newspaper.  A statement issued by the Aladdin said Ronstadt had been "escorted out of the hotel" just after her performance and said the performer would "not be welcomed back."  "Ms. Ronstadt was hired to entertain the guests of the Aladdin, not to espouse political views," the casino said.'   Now that adds a twist doesnt it?   It is interesting that the Freedom of Speech guidelines seem to be equally appled to the Freedom Not to Hear. I am not sure what I would have done if a person I was paying used my space to espouse beliefs that were not held by me. I suppose it boils down to the time and place issue. But in the end, it's&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;sad to think that her gesture was motivated to intentionally irritate people that I am sure felt they "paid good money" to see the washed up woman.  &nbsp; Personally, I think the site of a bunch of senior citizens rioting would have been pure entertainment at its best. Apparently conservatives ripping up posters and hassling&nbsp;the box office with their walkers and canes was too much entertainment for the&nbsp;Alladin to handle.&nbsp;  Well, thats all the news in fits of print. More or less.   --Mack&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;
