						   I worked all day out in the freaking barn again.&nbsp; Like normal, I go out about 8 or 8:30 each morning to feed the baby calves, but today, it ticked me off for some reason.&nbsp; It takes me 45 minutes each morning to feed, put animals in their prospective pastures, clean stalls and give fresh water.&nbsp; But today, for some reason, I got fed up with it.&nbsp; NLG and I moved a ton (20 bales) of hay around in the barn to make room for another shipload of shavings, and then I decided I wanted the calves out of the barn and into the outside stall.&nbsp; They have outgrown the inside stall we made for them in the barn.&nbsp; When they arrived, they were just babies and I didn't want them outside getting cold (even though it only cools down to the 60's now) or getting eaten up by the coyotes.&nbsp; But now, they have grown a little and I had NLG seal up the fencing around the outside stall to give them a little bit more of security.&nbsp; I imagine I will sleep with the window open again and have the flashlight and gun ready in case I hear anything going on out there tonight.&nbsp; In order to put the calves in the outdoor stall, I had to move the goat inside.&nbsp; Do you know what goat poop looks like??&nbsp; Its like deer poop.&nbsp; It’s impossible to pick up! So I had to sweep it up!&nbsp; There I am, sweeping the dirt and poop up.&nbsp; The stall is about 24' x 12' big, so I had to do a lot of sweeping.&nbsp; I think the goat's days here are numbered.&nbsp; I've decided I do not like goats.&nbsp; Stupid thing poops everywhere! But the problem is that Magic has totally adopted her.&nbsp; They are inseparable.&nbsp; NLG doesn't like it when I ask him to do work in the barn for the animals.&nbsp; He thinks I'm too picky for them.&nbsp; He's just stupid!&nbsp; You know I'm not picky!&nbsp; I imagine that goat will last about a week inside the barn, when I will ask -NLG again to fix me up another outdoor stall for the freaking goat.&nbsp; I may just ask him to build me a shelter to put out in one of the pastures for her to sleep in and keep the freaking thing out there.&nbsp; I'll be glad when the calves are weaned, but that won't be for another 2 freaking months yet.&nbsp; This weekend I will try to get them off the bottle and to drink their milk from a bucket.&nbsp; I'm already looking forward to one of them being in the freezer.&nbsp; The one that we decided to keep for a pet is looking good for the freezer too.&nbsp; I guess I need a job outside of the home.&nbsp; NLG is ticking&nbsp;me off and so are the freaking animals.&nbsp; Magic has bonded with me so well that she follows me around the pasture like a puppy dog.&nbsp; She's the only one that I'm not ticked&nbsp;1off at.&nbsp; I just call her name from the house and she answers me wherever she is.&nbsp; It’s totally cool.&nbsp; I'm afraid I'm becoming a redneck.&nbsp; I don't even want to tell you what that means.&nbsp; I guess I've vented enough for one day.&nbsp; I guess I'll get up off this Lazy-Boy and shut down the computer and go help NLG with dinner.&nbsp; We're barbecuing ribs.&nbsp; I think I'll go over to the calves and show them what we're having for dinner.   I wrote that yesterday and today's big news is that I introduced the calves to milk in a bucket!&nbsp; It took about 20 minutes for each calf to stick his head in the bucket.&nbsp; I had to put a nipple inside the bucket and in the milk, that way they recognized the nipple and began to suck.&nbsp; I just had to hold down the nipple in the milk.&nbsp; Boy, are my hands soft.&nbsp; Hopefully, tomorrow morning's feeding shouldn't take so long.&nbsp;

						   After a long day out away from the house, visiting dad and 'mama' at the nursing home, ticking 'mama'&nbsp;off because I made her eat some vegetables (that was the highlight!), buying new furniture and stuff, we finally pulled into the driveway about 6:30.&nbsp; It wasn’t quite dark yet, so I went to the barn to put Magic in for the night and to give her dinner.&nbsp; Normally, when she sees us drive in, she follows the car and heads to the barn.&nbsp; As I am driving down the driveway, I notice her in the arena and she is looking very intently into the trees along the river.&nbsp; I don’t think much about this as she does this often.&nbsp; What I did notice is that she doesn’t move to the barn.&nbsp;   By the time I park the car in the drive, and walk over to the barn, I have to call her to come to me.&nbsp; Another signal that something wasn’t right.&nbsp; After a few calls, she comes to me.&nbsp; We’re standing in the pasture right outside the barn.&nbsp; Again, she normally will follow me into the barn because she knows she gets her treats (oats) with her alfalfa.&nbsp; This is like heroin to an addict.&nbsp; She will try to climb over me to get to her oats.&nbsp;   I’m able to coax her into the barn, but she comes flying out again before I can close the gate.&nbsp; Whats up with that?&nbsp; I thought I would put her feed in her feeder so then she would see me doing that.&nbsp; That didn’t work either.&nbsp; She is terrified of something and is obviously scared about going into her stall.&nbsp; About 2 weeks ago, I took down the siding covering 2 of her walls, giving her an unobstructed view of the lower pasture and the trees along side the barn.&nbsp; We put the walls up last winter to help keep her warm and dry.&nbsp; The fencing in her stall now is a 4-foot high, 4-board fence.   Back to the story.&nbsp; I finally get her into the stall by walking her into it with her can of oats in one hand and the lead rope around her neck!&nbsp; Stupid horse would not come in any other way.&nbsp; I get the gate closed and locked and my next chore is to put her blanket on her.&nbsp; It still gets a little cool at night and I don’t want her to catch a cold!&nbsp; (How anal is this)&nbsp; I’ve now got the blanket in my arms and it is normally no problem putting it on her.&nbsp; She normally stands still and lets me fasten the 2 belly straps, 2 hind leg straps, and the 2 snaps on the chest straps.&nbsp; On a good day, this takes me about 30 seconds.&nbsp; However, I knew this was not going to be a good day.&nbsp; She starts dancing around me inside her stall.&nbsp; I manage to throw the blanket on her, which freaks her out.&nbsp; This does not make any sense to me at all.&nbsp; Naturally, I get mad.&nbsp; I do realize this isn’t the place to be mad in, a 12x24 foot stall with a 16hand horse, weighing in at 1100 pounds.&nbsp; I calm down and talk calmly to her and manage to get the blanket just so it sits right on her.&nbsp; Getting it fastened in all the places took about 5 minutes.&nbsp;   NLG, in the meantime, is in the house and can’t figure out what is taking me so long.&nbsp; I had cleaned the stall that morning before we left for the day and knew putting her up for the night only took about 5 minutes.&nbsp; He comes out to find me dealing with a horse that is almost out of control.   We start putting together the whole situation, Magic in the pasture and not moving towards the barn when she sees us pull up; her not wanting to go in her stall and not wanting to stay in it when she does go in it.&nbsp; Something was out there scaring her.&nbsp; We hear the neighbors’ dogs barking.&nbsp; Okay, we’re dealing with a critter hear.&nbsp; We know if it was a bear, we would hear it growl or at least move through the bushes and in the river.&nbsp; We didn’t hear anything.&nbsp; I stay with Magic and NLG goes in and calls a friend about it.&nbsp; We were told that it was probably a cat, or more specifically, a cougar!&nbsp; Evidently, there have been some spotted here in the valley.&nbsp;   He comes back out to the barn and tells me this.&nbsp; By now it is pitch dark and am being told that there is a dangerous animal lurking about.&nbsp; No wonder Magic is freaking out.&nbsp; She either smells it or hears it or both!&nbsp; MNLG goes inside and brings me a flashlight so I can check out the edge of the pasture that borders the river.&nbsp; Magic is getting worse.&nbsp; She is rearing up inside her stall and is convinced that something is going to get her.&nbsp; I now decide to stay in the barn with her to help calm her and make sure she doesn’t injure herself.&nbsp; Mike goes back to the house and gets a 2nd flashlight and loads the revolver.&nbsp; I’m panicked to say the least.&nbsp; We’re outside the barn, NLG explores around by the arena with the flashlight and gun.&nbsp; I’m in the middle of the pasture, right in front of the barn.&nbsp; The sensor lights are on and all the lights are on inside the barn.&nbsp; Magic is snorting and going nuts in her stall.&nbsp; I’m trying to console her standing in front of the gate that keeps her in her stall, thinking how lucky I was she didn’t kill me while I was trying to put her blanket on and that a stupid wild animal didn’t jump in there from behind the stall and get us both.&nbsp;   NLG stays out there for about 30 minutes until he starts getting hungry.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; Hungry?&nbsp; Are you kidding me?&nbsp; I’m afraid for my life and my horse’s life and he is now concerned about eating.&nbsp; Okay, he leaves me the gun and brings out the intercom that goes in the barn.&nbsp; This way I can at least tell him that a wild animal is in the barn and is about to eat me.&nbsp; I’m standing on the hay stack, about 2 feet over Magic’s head, with one hand holding the flashlight searching the outer pasture, and the other hand holding a loaded revolver, trying to keep myself and my&nbsp;horse calm.&nbsp; I’m realizing that this must look hysterical.&nbsp; One nervous female with a loaded gun in her hand, and I might add, menopausal.&nbsp; But we won’t go there.&nbsp; The next thing NLG does is to come back out and shout to me (because he won’t walk out there without the gun) “Hey babe, do you want a glass of wine?”&nbsp; What the heck!&nbsp; I’m in the barn, about 10 feet up standing on hay bales, trying to keep my balance and not fall between the bales, clutching the flashlight and trying not to shoot myself in the foot with the gun and trying hard not to add to the panicked horse who is spinning, snorting, rearing up, and crapping all over the place.&nbsp; Yeah, now he wants to serve me wine and cheese.&nbsp; I guess he must be thinking this would be my last supper or something.&nbsp; I’m thinking, here I am, holding a flashlight and a gun, how in the heck am I gonna hold my wine!&nbsp; There is something wrong with this picture of a woman in my frame of mind with a glass of wine and a loaded gun!&nbsp; Am I right!&nbsp; I would know not to shoot myself and there is no way in the world that I would shoot my horse…. The only thing left would be NLG!&nbsp; He’d come walking up and I would just shoot him, thinking he was the cougar.&nbsp; I tell him to save me a glass and if I make it back into the house, I will for sure want it then.&nbsp;   Two hours later, I come back into the house.&nbsp; Magic is calmer, the dogs have stopped barking and now, I’m hungry and I want my wine.&nbsp; I leave the barn lights on so that I can see her from the house.&nbsp; The gun is still loaded and in the bedroom.  The moral of the story is that we will never leave Magic alone at night again.&nbsp; We will always be here by the time it gets dark.&nbsp; NLG is in the middle of redoing the laundry room/service area and when he finishes that, we will move the approximately 3 tons of hay around in the barn and move Magic to the middle of it.&nbsp; That way no animal can get to her.&nbsp; We’ll store the hay in the outside stalls and leave the protected inner stall for her.&nbsp; I also do not want her to have an open window.&nbsp; She will have the windows with the bars in it so that no animal can get in.&nbsp; It won’t leave her with much of a view, just 4 walls, but she will be safe!&nbsp; She was in an inside stall like this when we bought her, so she will be familiar with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I thought about wiring the outside of the barn with the electric fencing.&nbsp; This way, if anything came up to the barn, they would get zapped!&nbsp; NLG doesn’t like that idea, I don’t know why.&nbsp;   &nbsp;He just came in from the laundry area and chewed me out because he found an old meat cleaver like knife that I had thrown away.&nbsp; Evidently it is like 60 years old and he wants to keep it.&nbsp; I see it as an old rusty thing and thought it should be thrown away.&nbsp; I had to promise not to throw anything else in the garage away again.&nbsp; Crap.

						   I know you all have been waiting for another exciting story to come your way from my experience up here.&nbsp; I believe you will find this one worth waiting for....   It all happened last week.&nbsp; My dad gives me a call last Wednesday night and was very upset.&nbsp; It seems his wife, (dad calls her 'mama'), had fallen at home while he was at the store and by the time he got home, the paramedics were there.&nbsp; (This isn't the funny part)   This was Monday night.&nbsp; He didn't try calling me that day because he thought I was gone all day, which I wasn't, but again, that isn't the funny part.&nbsp; He tried calling all day Tuesday, but NLG had unplugged the phone.&nbsp; I plugged the phone in Wednesday afternoon, and by 9pm, that's when my dad finally talked with me.   He was pretty upset because he had been spending all day long at the hospital with 'mama'&nbsp;and getting home late and was by himself.&nbsp; I asked him if he wanted me to come over and he said no.&nbsp; I called my big brother  and told him to call him and speak to him.&nbsp; A few minutes later hem called me back and told me to go ahead and go over and spend the night with him.&nbsp; All of this so far was to give you an idea of the background, actually thinking about it, it probably doesn't matter one way or another of you knowing this, but oh well, its too late now.   So, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I spend all freaking day (9am to 7pm) at the hospital with dad.&nbsp; 'Mama' is hooked up with IVs and is pretty much out of it. She is 88 years old.&nbsp; By Sunday night, I needed a break and came home to spend the night.&nbsp; NLG had his hands full (No! not that) because our grandson is down visiting us for the first time in over a year.&nbsp; NLG is playing both grandma and grandpa with him.&nbsp; I spoke to our little grandson (who is almost 5), one day and he told me he didn't get dressed all day and had ice cream for lunch.&nbsp; Needless to say, I went home the next day.&nbsp; Again, probably nothing to do with the reason for this story, but I thought it was worth mentioning.&nbsp;   By now, I've called my sister-in-law in Portland to see if she could come down and share the joy.&nbsp;She&nbsp;graciously accpeted, for no other reason&nbsp;but to get her out of the house and to break up her routine.&nbsp; She spends the nights with him and I spend the days at the hospital with him.&nbsp; Thank God, 'mama' gets to leave today (we hope), but is being discharged to the nursing home to get physical therapy to relearn how to walk on her own and with a cane.&nbsp; Now, we're getting to the good part.   Yesterday, I was at the hospital again because the doctor was coming by and dad wanted me there.&nbsp; 'Mama' was in and out of sleep and dad and I just finished our game of cribbage when he told me about him have diarrhea the past couple of days.&nbsp; I'm thinking, dad, why are you telling me this??&nbsp; He is whispering this to me because he doesn't want 'mama to hear, nor the lady in the next bed!&nbsp; He is bending down to me (I was sitting next to the bed) and telling me he had to go to the john every 10 minutes or so and was constantly in the bathroom the previous day.&nbsp;&nbsp;As he was telling me this, he was in the process of backing up a little and then was going to turn and head out the room.&nbsp; All of a sudden, he straightens up and makes this hysterical face.&nbsp; His eyes get wide open and his expression is that of total surprise/shock and then he says to me,&nbsp;"Oh crap, baby, I'm pooping my pants!"&nbsp; I've got tears coming out of my eyes right now just thinking about his face.&nbsp; He runs out the the room.&nbsp; Now the hard part is not to bust out laughing at him and waking&nbsp; up 'mama'.&nbsp; I was laughing as quietly as I could.&nbsp; Okay, time goes by and the doc comes and tells dad and 'mama' that she does indeed have to go to the nursing home first before she can go home to dad.&nbsp; She has to do this in order to get physical therapy 3 times a day and learn to walk on her own again, before she goes home and falls on her face again.   &nbsp;Now, I'm taking dad home.&nbsp; My&nbsp;sister-in-law took the night off as she went out to dinner with my cousins.&nbsp; I pull up to the house and dad gets out and shuts the door.&nbsp; The door doesn't shut all the way and so I tell him that he probably has his seatbelt in the door.&nbsp; He checks that and tries to shut the door again.&nbsp; But it still wouldn't shut.&nbsp; By now, I'm over there with him and trying to figure things out.&nbsp; Its after 7pm and is dark.&nbsp; I feel along the door jam and find out that his glasses in his black case had fallen out of his pocket and landed on the bottom of the door landing, right where the door meets the car.&nbsp; So every time we tried to shut the door, it was breaking up his glasses.&nbsp; You gotta understand that when anything goes off routine for dad, he gets upset.&nbsp; (Hmm, I guess I know who I take after).&nbsp; Anyway, he picks up his glass case and pulls out his glasses and one of the lens falls to the ground.&nbsp; Oh boy, dad goes ballistic.&nbsp; He doesn't use foul language per se, but from the car to the mail box where he was going to get the mail, all I could hear was a lot of swearing going on.&nbsp; I think it is hysterical because dad doesn’t swear a lot, but does say things like "billy hell."&nbsp; I don't know what that means, but he was saying it a lot.&nbsp; Now we are progressing to the back door and he is still cussing, shaking his head from side to side as if he is trying to make sense of it all.&nbsp; We have lights on all over the place and we're standing there on the back porch with his mail in one hand and he trying to find the right key on his key chain with the other hand.&nbsp; My hands are full of something, I can't remember what.&nbsp; I'm still laughing like crap over him being upset with the glasses, then all of a sudden... (get ready)... he is continuing to cus about his glasses when he says, Oh crap, now I'm gonna poop my pants again!"&nbsp; I couldn't stand it, I bust out laughing, dropping everything I had and wet my pants!!&nbsp; Dad is still trying to get the freaking door open and we're standing there, me out of control with laughter and trying with every once of control I could find not to totally empty my bladder!&nbsp; He finally finds the key and I run to the bathroom.&nbsp; I was hysterical the rest of the night.&nbsp;

						   2/17/04:&nbsp; After much procrastination, I’ve finally started a journal.&nbsp; There has been a lot of (quoting from my buddy, "Hez")&nbsp;'good stuff'” happening around here that is worth remembering!&nbsp;   I’ve been here at the ranch since October 2003.&nbsp; Since then, we’ve run out of water 3 times in that month alone.&nbsp; Talk about some confusion around here!&nbsp; After about a month of talking about it, NLG (nickname given to husband by buddy, meaning 'naked lawnmower guy' [ no need for further explanation) hired a guy&nbsp;from an&nbsp;electric and plumbing store&nbsp;to come out and hook up both our wells to feed into our house.&nbsp; We got a 2500-gallon holding tank and are thinking about getting another one.&nbsp; I teased NLG that it would be March before we had everything done.&nbsp; It is now mid February and if I had made a bet, I would probably be a rich woman.&nbsp;   We have about 1000 feet of open trenches on the property at this date.&nbsp; One well is completely hooked up and is fully automated.&nbsp; The other well has the pvc pipes and electric wires to it feeding the pump and for the outlet we want there.&nbsp; One pipe is for the well water to come to the holding tank and the other pipe is to flood the well area with river water to supply the well for our drinking water.&nbsp; Before it gets to the house, it will go through the filtration system we have set up.&nbsp; Because of the rain and the worker's&nbsp;days off, he has not been back out to finish the system.&nbsp; We are hoping that this Thursday will be his last day out to finish putting all the electric stuff up and checking everything out.&nbsp; We have a line trenched to the barn and to the greenhouse.&nbsp; This way, I will no longer have to deal with hoses to give water to the horse and to supply the greenhouse with its water.&nbsp; I will have running water in the barn!&nbsp;   I think there is something dead inside our heating ducts!!&nbsp; Ren (stud muffin cat)&nbsp;is going nuts.&nbsp; We can't even be in the guest room for more than a minute or two before the smell gets to us.&nbsp; In the middle of the night, we can hear something running around inside the heating vents.&nbsp; How could anything get in there.&nbsp; I was under the house the other day dealing with phone lines, I guess I need to get back under there and see if I see any tears in the underside of the house.&nbsp; At first I thought it could be a mole.&nbsp; But NLG says it is unlikely and is probably a mouse/rat.&nbsp; Either way, its freaking Ren out.&nbsp; Last night he sat in the kitchen a few feet from the duct and just stared at it.&nbsp; The plan is to lower a mousetrap down with a fishing line and see if we can get anything.&nbsp; I don't know what we're going to do about the smell.&nbsp; Maybe we can get a powerful vacuum and put down in each duct&nbsp;and see if we can't suck anything out.&nbsp; Crap!!&nbsp;  Magic (my beautiful American Saddlebred mare) has gone a couple of months now without injuring herself.&nbsp; I think she has finally settled down.&nbsp; NLG is trying to teach her to fetch!&nbsp; Stupid horse goes after wood for pete's sake.&nbsp; NLG throws a stick out and she goes after it and picks it up. We're still working on the part of having her bring it back.&nbsp; She likes to play soccer better.&nbsp; She has her own soccer ball to play with.&nbsp;   We are in the middle of replacing the front brakes on the Geo.&nbsp; Last week the clutch went out.&nbsp; Naturally I was driving and was&nbsp;in Bandon at the time.&nbsp; NLG had to start the car not using the clutch, which was interesting.&nbsp; We were able to get into 3rd gear and drove straight home.&nbsp; Every time we came to a stoplight, we circled around until it was green in our direction because we couldn't stop.&nbsp; One of the new things I've learned was how to disassemble the&nbsp;transmission and clutch and replace them.&nbsp; I refused to touch anything and wore gloves the whole time.&nbsp; NLG still has grease up to his elbows.&nbsp; We were at my dad's house Saturday&nbsp;when he mentioned the muscles in my arms.&nbsp; He chewed&nbsp;out NLG and told him that&nbsp;he was working me too hard.&nbsp; I got a kick out of that because normally, what he usually says&nbsp;first is, "My God baby, are&nbsp;you gaining weight!"&nbsp; Holy Crap!&nbsp; So this was a welcome change for him to notice my muscles, although they&nbsp;are only in my arms.&nbsp; But with all the crap I'm lifting daily, my back muscles have also gotten stronger.&nbsp; &nbsp;  Dad says that I hacked up the raspberry and marion berry bushes too much last year and it will probably take a couple of years for them to grow out and produce berries again... Who new!&nbsp; I also did a hack job on some rose bushes.&nbsp; Too bad on that one.&nbsp; I'm not supposed to cut anything back now.&nbsp; The magnolia tree has buds all of it now.&nbsp; We will have pink blossoms in the spring for sure.&nbsp; I sure don't look forward to it shedding its leaves.&nbsp; There must be a ton of them that fall off.&nbsp; I waited too long to rake some of them last year and the grass is just now starting to grow back!&nbsp;   We're getting nice green grass and clover from where the river flooded the property in December.&nbsp; Its been sandy since the flood, but now green is sprouting up all over.&nbsp;   I can't figure this out.&nbsp; I had some film developed at Wal-Mart and the whole stinking cd contains nothing but one picture!&nbsp; There was lots of pictures of me on the stupid horse before I took this one of the darlyn and her fiance.&nbsp; Must be a sign or something because I can't figure it out.&nbsp; Stupid computer!  I haven't worn a bra in two days, I'm sure I'll be sagging down to my knees by the time I'm fifty.&nbsp; Just a little information for you, hehe.&nbsp; (Stupid horse is eating the apple tree right now.)  It rained for a couple of days straight, which means the river, rose a few feet and is muddy again.&nbsp; We still haven't seen any steelhead yet, but there are lots of guys getting them right up the road from us, so we know they are passing by our house.&nbsp; (Why is that stupid horse still eating the tree?)  Ren is not in here... hmmm.&nbsp; He usually follows me in and sits on the desk and makes a nuisance of himself when I'm trying to type.&nbsp; I wonder if he caught a mouse?&nbsp; He's probably freaked out and is sitting on some countertop somewhere.&nbsp; Well, I'm finally cold, which is a welcome change from these freaking hot flashes!!&nbsp; I'm going to go and turn on the heat and watch an old movie.&nbsp; Yeah, life is hard... (and I'm still not wearing a bra!)

						   At the advice of a few friends, I've started a journal of what my life has been like since my move from the city to the country.&nbsp; Tears, depression, homesickness, undescribable joy, laughter, peace of mind are just a few emotions of what I've experienced since my move in October 2003.&nbsp; I hope you can find a little humor and can even relate on some level from my experiences here at the farm.   I will add to my journal my previous writings I've been saving for the past 10 months.   DeeDee
