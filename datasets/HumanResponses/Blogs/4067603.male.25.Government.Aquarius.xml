        I went for my OGD today... it was an experience that well, while it was pretty unpleasant while it lasted, it was pretty exciting nonetheless! I had never had an IV line set on me before! Let alone had endoscopy done! And I didn't have to pay a single cent! Professional courtesy I guess... I am a doctor too after all.

       Righto. I'm back from my movie outing. Went out with Jo and Josh to watch I, Robot. I've seen it already, but I guess I just needed an excuse to go out. Thank God for friends like them who don't mind accomodating me even though I'm sure they have better things to do.

        My name is DK. This is my first serious attempt at weblogging... and yet, I'm not exactly new to posting my feelings up on the internet for everyone to see. I used to have an open diary... pretty much the precursor to the current form of blogging which is so ubiquitous now.

        Darling I can’t explain     Where did we lose our way?     Girl it’s driving me insane     And I know I just need one more chance     To prove my love to you     If you come back to me,      I’ll guarantee     That I’ll never let you go          Can we go back to the days our love was strong?     Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?     Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be?     Oh God give me a reason     I’m down on bended knee     I’ll never walk again until you come back to me     I’m down on bended knee          So many nights that I dreamed of you     Holding my pillow tight and I know that I don’t need to be alone     When I open up my eyes t    o face reality     Every moment without you     It seems like eternity     I’m begging you, begging you come back to me          Gonna swallow my pride     Say I’m sorry     Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me     I want a new life, and I want it with you     If you feel the same, don’t ever let it go     You gotta believe in the spirit of love     It will heal all things     We won’t hurt anymore     No, I don’t believe our love’s terminal     I’m down on my knees begging you please     Come home...

        I discovered all of the following only after having a good chat with Vic last night...

        Sorry I haven't posted in 2 weeks. Things have been pretty busy for me, and I've been taking some time out to think about things and try to be happy. I think I'm pretty much over this whole Jen issue, but I found out certain things last night which are quite disturbing frankly.      I've been talking to another of my ex's, Vic. I think I mentioned her in some earlier posts. She was avoiding me then, and I didn't know why. Well, we finally started talking, and some light has been shed on certain issues.      We had been talking on ICQ for a while the last couple of days, but until last night, we hadn't had a decent conversation on the telephone as yet. She called me at around half past ten yesterday, and we talked for about 2 and a half hours. I think we achieved a certain amount of closure with regards to our relationship. We didn't end all that well, and it was good to clear up all those misunderstandings. I had a lot of things to say to her which I didn't manage to tell her back then. I guess so did she.      It made me realise how  wrong  the concept of Jen and I was to begin with. It dawned on me how different we were, and how unhappy I really was with her. Anyway, it doesn't matter now. What does matter to me, and it's strange that it does... is that I realised how happy I was with Vic, and how badly I screwed it up. We talked a bit about where  we  went wrong, and what needed to be changed.       Honestly, it felt good to be talking to Vic again. We weren't together all that long, only slightly less than a year... but I felt that I had found a soulmate in her. I loved her more than knew I could... but it was a selfish, possesive kind of love. I guess it was the only type I knew back then. When she broke up with me, I was devastated. Usually, I take only a day to get over things... but I was a wreck for months. I couldn't eat, sleep... I couldn't even go to work. I even had to go talk to a priest for counselling. I blamed myself for screwing things up, and my parents were worried sick during that period... and I feel ever so remorseful for that... they even bought me a new car to try to cheer me up. Eventually I got over Vic by shutting her out of my life. She made attempts to talk to me... but I pretty much told her to get lost. I still loved her deeply then, but I knew I couldn't have any contact with her if I wanted to move on with my life. Later on, I found out she was seeing someone... and that she was happy. I was upset at first, but it was the catalyst which finally made me get on with my life. Soon after that, Jen and I got together. And the rest, as they say, is history.      More on this later... need to go do ward rounds now.

        Indeed it is! It's only 9.40am, I've  barely  done any work today, and the  sian-ness  I feel is utterly beyond description. To think I still have another 7 more hours to go. It's not that I don't love what I'm doing... perhaps it's just pre-call blues. I'm on call again tomorrow. My calls this month are closer together than usual because I'll be on study leave later this month. Yep. Studying for my postgrad exams in Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

        So once again, here I am sitting here at work blogging. Before you think anything, no... it's not that I'm damn free... one of the unique aspects of working in an emergency department (well technically, it's just a 24Hr clinic...) is that there are peaks and troughs in the work load. It gets pretty busy during meal times and immediately after office hours. I happen to have just cleared the lunch-time crowd.      The last couple of days have been pretty uneventful on the whole Jen/relationship front. I did however finally get that supplementary credit card I applied for her when we were still together. I decided to give it to her anyway. I'm not sure why though. Perhaps I thought it would make her realise that she still means something to me. Anyway, she messaged me this morning saying that she can't keep the card. I replied and told her that she might as well keep it for the 1st year and enjoy the perks that come with it. She replied again that she was at work and that we'll talk about this another time. Fine. Honestly, as much as I used to care for her, and I probably still do, sometimes she really irritates me and I just want to avoid her. Having said that, she asked me to go with her to that spa place again this Saturday. And guess what? I agreed. No real surprise there huh?      Here's a little recap on the last 2 days: I was post call on Monday... so I pretty much spent the whole afternoon sleeping at home. I had a hectic morning that day.... what with this 32 week pregnant lady delivering in my clinic. We were totally unprepared! That was the first time I delivered any baby outside of the delivery suite. After that, I met up with some old jc classmates for dinner at Marche. I noticed a 'street sign' at Marche which read "Rue de Rivoli". This was the exact street Jen and I stayed on when we were in Paris in June. So, I photographed it with my phone and sent an MMS to her. That was stupid. I was supposed to be under a self-imposed Jen-embargo. So much for that. I didn't really get a reply from her immediately though. When she did see me online the next day however, she automatically assumed I was on a date. Well, my dear Jen... I'm not like you.      Tuesday was tiring. I worked my ass off the whole day, then met up with Denise to buy a birthday present for Cos. Yep! It was his 23rd yesterday. We got him a nice pair of jeans from Zara. I also managed to get my dad's birthday present as well. It's the big SIX-OH this Sunday! But I must say, save for the grey hair, he doesn't look a day over 45! I hope I look that good when I'm 60...      We packed 6 of us into my poor Volvo and headed off for our buffet dinner. Dinner was good... but once again I over-ate and felt like throwing up. It was however, a long time since I last pigged out. Jen used to keep a tight reign over my dietary habits. The difference this morning while wearing my pants however, was very noticeable... fortunately I feel better now after skipping breakfast and only having a light lunch. I have the courage to face dinner now...      According to Colin, Doom 3 will be out in Singapore today. I feel like playing a computer game to get my mind of things. Hopefully it works...

        So here I am sitting in my little 'clinic' on call at the hospital on a Sunday. I hate Sunday calls. If it isn't the slackers who are just looking to cut work/school on Monday and seeking for an MC, it's the ridiculous patients who will insist on coming in after midnight for vaginal discharge. *sigh*. And I still have to carry on with this until 12.30pm Monday afternoon before I'm let off...      So anyway, I met Jen for lunch yesterday afternoon. She wanted to go to a spa, but it was raining, so we just went for lunch at the Marmalade Pantry at Palais Renaissance. We talked. She seemed rather enthausiastic about talking about how happy she is. I'm happy for her. At least I'm trying to be. I'm trying to feel apathetic about it all when she talks about this guy who's interested in her, this other guy whom she's talking to, or that guy who also may be interested in her. WHATEVER.       My displeasure was quite apparent during the lunch I guess. But I was trying. At the very least, I didn't lose my temper and flare up. That says a lot if you know me well. It still hurts to see her though. Like I said, I'm trying to reach a state where I don't give a crap at all... but it's really difficult. I don't think I'll be seeing her for a while. But then, I said that on Thursday...      If things just couldn't get shittier, I discovered that Jen somehow has made friends with another of my ex's, Vic. WTF is going on here? When I asked her what the deal was with that, she just replied that Vic seemed like a nice person and that they 'have a lot in common'. Right. Like me perhaps? She says that they're not talking to bitch about me and that I'm 'not the only thing in their lives'. Granted... I'll just have to take what she says at face value. What can I do about it anyway?      When I sent her back to her place, we just parked outside her gate and talked for a while. I apologised for my behavior and reiterated that I really am trying to be 'normal friends' with her. Then she proceeded to talk about more personal stuff involving new guys and I just lost it. I didn't flare up at her, but I just cut her in midspeech and told her I had to go. She got the message I guess. She upped and got out of my car in a huff. I tried to call her after that to apologise again. But she didn't want to take my call. That's fine. I know her. I'll just let her chill for a while.      I didn't want to do that to her... to behave that way. But I had pretty much kept it all in for the last 3 and a half hours, and that was about as much as I could take. I'm not sure I still love her. It's become ever so apparent how different we are... how differently we handle things... how different our views are. Some part of me still wants to be with her... but I know that's my heart talking. Logically speaking, my brain tells me that I just long for the companionship that being in a relationship brings. Because simply put, Jen and I are incompatible. We tried. Several times in fact... but it still didn't work out. It's true that you can't force things to work if they weren't 'meant to be' in the first place.      I'm no longer upset that we broke up. I just want to be happy. If anything, I'm upset that I can't seem to maintain a healthy stable relationship anymore. Let's put it this way... my last 3 relationships have all fizzled out after less than a year. I do believe it's 3 months, 10 months and now 4 months.      I'm really really tired of this whole dating thing. I want so much to just find someone to settle down with... but well, I don't think I'm ready just yet. I'll just be rushing into things, and in all likelihood, it's going to go down the tubes like the last couple of times.      As for Vic. Well... she's avoiding me. And her mother's screening my calls and not letting her talk to me. While things didn't exactly end on a high note between us, I did speak to her recently, and she seemed quite receptive to the idea of being friends. Hell... when Jen and I were having problems and she advised me to leave her alone for a bit, she told me to call her whenever I felt the urge to bug Jen, and that she'll talk me out of it. I thought that was sweet at first.... but I guess women never really say what they mean. She hasn't taken the initiative to return my calls at all. She doesn't reply my ICQ messages and she won't add me to her MSN or friendster lists. BUT she adds my ex-girlfriend to her MSN and friendster list? WTF is wrong with women?!?!      This is why dating makes me feel a little off-colour now. And that nice girl I was supposed to go out with on Friday? Well, she SMSed me to see how I was feeling after the scope. So I called her and talked to her for a while. She seems like a pretty nice person to talk to. But at this point in time, I'm just looking for a friend. Someone I can hang out with and not have all this issues to deal with. It would be nice to make a new friend. I'm not really looking for anything more...      In the end, I went for mass... finding a little bit of serenity in the process... although some technical problems did give me a bit of a headache for a while... seeing as how I was rostered to be conductor yesterday. After mass, my friends and choir family adjourned to my place for dinner.. (it's choir ritual now to go to someone's place for dinner after mass...) After which, the younger ones, (me included!) went out to a nearby pub for some drinks and pool. 4 single guys bitching about how women suck. Ahhh.... so bitter and yet... well... comforting. Sad huh?      On the way back, this army 5-tonner beat a red light and could've slammed into my car probably killing Josh, Cos and I if not for my keen peripheral vision(heh). My light had already turned green, but I saw the truck coming at speed at the corner of my eye. It didn't look like he had an intention to stop. Well, he didn't. Poor driver. On any other day, we probably would've let it go. But we were 3 pissed off dudes and we weren't gonna take it lying down. We followed the truck back to the camp it was headed for and lodged a complaint. Ah well.      That was pretty much my Saturday. It's Sunday now and I've managed to see one patient and kill about 45 minutes typing this out. Only 22 more hours to endure...
