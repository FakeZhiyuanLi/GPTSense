        Tadaaa! As promised, a sample of my masterpieces! The lighting's bad and my sister's camera is not that effective in taking pics of subjects up close but like a proud mother, I present to you my obra maestra...    The aquamarine bracelet is one of my absolute favorites, if not my favorite piece of accessory. This one took me forever to make but the effort was worth it!     No, this is not a rosary. This is actually a necklace made with wooden beads and a rose quartz pendant.      This one is made of small native red beads and a pendant made of carnelia. I gave this piece to my sister's friend, Tanya.     Remember when I first attempted to make beaded accessories? Yup, these were my very first pieces. The bracelet used to be a necklace but I had to redo them because I thought they were too plain. I gave this pair to my Tita Jess when we watched her daughter's ballet in CCP.     Inspired by the jewelry pieces worn by Helen in the movie Troy. Very Oscar-ish.

      There’s this weird garbage disposal policy in the building where we’re staying.   There’s no proper disposal system in place, so tenants usually leave plastic bags of trash outside their doors at any time of the day to be picked up by the landlady’s helpers or the guards on duty.  Problem is, ringkoos (coined by my sister; contraption of cat, which is Kuring in Ilonggo) usually get to these plastic bags before the landlady’s minions do. And when the ringkoos make pakialam the trash, all hell breaks loose.  You can practically infer what the next-door neighbor ate for dinner or if she has her monthly period by the damning evidence strewn all over the hallway floor.  Landlady finally got fed up and issued a handwritten memo to everyone that plastic bags of trash should be placed outside the doors at certain times only:  9-10 am.  3-4 pm.  10-11 pm.  I told my sister that this has been the funniest thing I’ve read all year. Ringkoos do not follow a schedule. Even if I take my trash out from, say, 9-10 a.m., that’s not an assurance that the little fellas will not attack my garbage like a piece of punching bag. Unless of course landlady’s minions guard every floor of the building every minute of those hourly schedules.  The solution does not lie in the scheduling of when trash should be taken out. The building should have a proper disposal system (read: covered trash bins on every floor). Now, I’ve been a tenant here for two years and Mrs. A, the landlady, hasn’t done much about it. She’s too kuripot to shell out a few bucks for a proper disposal system on every floor. Hence, she comes up with the most hilarious of ideas.  Maybe I should initiate forming a building association with my co-tenants and electing myself as President. Goody, I haven’t considered that among my oyster choices!

      Suffice it to say that I finally got fed up with the loonies in the office. My five months in Kulitibank (which I am tempted to call Shittybank at this point but my sister says calling it as such would be a phonetic giveaway) can rival Lee Iacocca’s last corporate days at Ford Motor Co. in the 1970’s. Just like my good ol’ idol Lee, I’ll write a book about it someday and get my ultimate revenge: let the customers of Sh, er, Kulitibank worldwide know that they are entrusting their money with people who should be in straitjackets instead of suits and earn loads of dough from the book rights at the same time.   I read somewhere that last year, J.K. Rowling made it to Forbes’ Millionaires List. Maybe I should consider carving out a career as a writer. But then again, I sing better than I write. And in the local scenario, Regine V. definitely earns a lot more than Benilda Santos.   ***  So I’m back in our 2 bedroom unit in Backwell, Makati and deliriously happy (read: reunited with fashionista must-haves like my bags and shoes and back in my sweetie’s arms!). I’m getting teary-eyed.  If there’s one thing I like about being unemployed, it’s the feeling that the world once again has infinite possibilities. The world is an oyster and the oyster is mine for the taking. You can quote me on that.   Oyster choices:  1.Work as a lounge singer in a five-star hotel while waiting for calls for interview from prospective employers.  2.Enrol in a Flamenco Class - My friend Marj mentioned to me that a Flamenco Class is being held in a building along Kalayaan. I couldn’t help but imagine my cute self fully made up in a CanCan dress and a bowl of plastic fruits on top of my head – Wait a minute, is that the costume for flamenco?  3.Hone my French speaking skills. I’m actually thinking of putting this one aside since I can speak French already. I pepper my speech with moi, tres, crème de la crème, tete a tete…I mean how much French does a girl need anyway?  4.Finish MBA thesis. On the other hand, I’d rather have a root canal.  5.Turn beaded accessories hobby into a multimillion-peso enterprise.  6.Transform our unit from refugee chic to minimalist zen.  7.Join raffle draws. I am currently in this “raffle draw” phase. I figured that if I join all the raffle draws that are available in my lifetime, I am bound to win one eventually. I collect Palmolive sachets and Mercury Drug receipts. I’m also scared to receive my cellphone bill next month as I have been texting a game show incessantly these past few days…  8.See my “psychic” friend Agnes and ask her to teach me how to meditate and communicate with my guardian angels. Everytime I meet up with Agnes, I leave with a feeling that I’ve just had lunch with Siddharta Buddha. She’s always been egging me to hold a meditation session in the condo unit I share with my sister.  9.Be a movie critic, write a column in a newspaper or magazine and watch movies for a living.  Sigh! So many things to do, sooo plenty of time. I love being unemployed!

      Some classic lines from my office mentors, Matrix Boss, Mini Me* and Olive Oyl (No close encounter with Capo di Tutti Capo and so she’s lucky her words will not be immortalized here):  ***  Matrix Boss: (On my first day as IC of Cebu) You have to tell me Glends, that you will be happy here. Because if you say you will not be, then I have no business holding you back here in Cebu.   Glenville to herself: Is that supposed to be my daily mantra here? I WILL be happy, I WILL be happy, I WILL be happy, I WILL be happy…  ***  More on work and happiness…  Olive Oyl: Rate your happiness from 1 to 10.  Glenville: 5. (Is this a trick question?)  Olive Oyl: Ok.  I flagellate myself afterwards for not saying negative 5 instead. What is it about these guys and happiness?!  ***  Via e-mail…  Olive Oyl: To help the bank save on cost, you will take the promo flight (which is the 5 am flight) to Cebu on Friday.  On the phone…  Glenville: Am I still expected to go to work on Thursday considering that this is practically a relocation on my part? I have 11 years’ worth of things here in Manila which I need to ship out. And that includes taking care of the shipment of my car.  Olive Oyl: That’s no longer the problem of the bank. You are still expected to go to work on Thursday, whole day.  Glenville: What if I take the next flight, the 7:30 am flight, instead?  Olive Oyl: You will have to shoulder the difference.  Glenville: How much is the difference?  Olive Oyl: P500.  Glenville: I’ll pay for it.  Olive Oyl: Ok.  Newsflash via internal memo:   “Kulitigroup has never been stronger.  2003 was a record year for the Group. Kulitigroup earned almost US$18 billion last year, and has US$104.1 billion in total equity.  Given the size and strength of our balance sheet, as well as our strong earnings performance, we continue to have formidable capital strength.”   This year, I can proudly say that I contributed P500 or roughly US$8.93 to Kulitigroup’s revenues. I am such a good employee I want to pat myself forcefully on the head.   ***  Mini Me: You are expected to be here every Monday at exactly 8:15 am for the morning sales huddle.  Glenville: Yes, I know. (Eventhough my employment contract says 8:30 am to 5:30 pm, Mondays to Fridays)  Mini Me: So why were you not here?  Glenville: Well, I was on a business trip to Iloilo, remember? I sent an e-mail to Olive Oyl of the itinerary of the details of the trip including my departure time from Cebu and arrival time in Cebu on Monday.   Mini Me: Yeah, but you still should have been here because the Monday sales huddle is very important.  Glenville: The trip, including the flight schedules, was with approval from my boss, Olive Oyl.  Mini Me: Yeah but the Monday sales huddle is very important (At this point, she really sounded ridiculous and she must have realized it because she sounded as if she was whispering to herself).  Glenville: Ok, noted that the Monday sales huddle is important.   Mini Me: Yeah, and you know, you were not here Monday last week too.  Glenville: I was here last last Monday.  Mini Me: No, you were not.  Glenville: I was here. I even conducted the market update for all of you, remember?  Mini Me: I don’t remember (Again, she sounded unsure because she was mumbling to herself). And please, next time, be sure to be here at exactly 8:15 a.m. every Monday.  Mini Me does a pirouette and poof! She vanished like the wicked witch in my nightmares.  I am left by my desk wondering if I was in Twilight Zone.    *Mini Me – This one is really brilliant (I’m so smart sometimes, it kills me!). She’s the vertically challenged OIC whenever Matrix Boss is not around.

      I have a confession to make.  One summer while I was in high school, a rumor spread in our neighborhood in Iloilo.  Well, of course, I heard it from Diding, our household help who had an uncanny resemblance to Whoopie Goldberg and who equally had her gift of gab.  "Day, si Zenia bala, anu kunu, kabit sang isa ka tawu nga taas posisyon sa Ayala Life”.  Day, you know what. They say that Zenia is the mistress of a high ranking executive at Ayala Life . Zenia is the daughter of one of our neighbors, working as an executive assistant in the same company.  ***  The rumor mills were working overtime for several weeks but I didn’t give it much thought until one day, while I was out of the house rollerskating, I heard Diding excitedly talking to the next-door helper, “Na! Amu na siya ang sugar daddy ni Zenia!”  That’s the one! That’s Zenia’s sugar daddy!   And so my sight followed the imaginary line where Diding’s thick, pursed lips were pointing at.  First, I recognized the car. Then I saw Zenia got out and my eyes fell on a familiar-looking Sugar Daddy. To my amazement, Sugar Daddy was the dad of Marichris, my best friend! At the tender age of 13, I realized that Married Happily Ever After was actually a slim statistic.  ***  Remember that was Iloilo in the summer of 1990. We had no telephone lines, much less mobile phones and pagers. The cool way to communicate then was to write in perfumed stationeries sealed in an envelope marked with xxx on the flap and sent through snail mail.  I couldn’t wait for summer to end so that I could warn Marichris about her dad.  So I began to write,   “Dear Marichris,  Hello! How are you? Kumusta ang summer mo? Me, I’m fine.  ……...(followed by senseless girl talk about crushes and family activities).  By the way, your dad is having an affair with our neighbor, Zenia.  Love and Kisses,  Glenda”  ***  The really funny thing about it is that I didn’t send my letter through snail mail.  I sealed the letter in an envelope with an xxx on the flap, went over to the house of Zenia and sweetly asked her to give my letter to Marichris’ dad who I said, should in turn give the letter to my friend.  And so this is the story of how Marichris learned about her dad’s affair with his secretary. Little did Tito and Zenia know that they were unwilling accomplices to my underhanded expose.   ***    I don’t know when or how the short-lived affair ended but what I do know is that Marichris and I would split our seams laughing whenever we recount the summer I decided to sabotage her dad’s illicit relationship with one of our neighbors.  I was a sneaky little bitch, I know. But I’ve since made peace with myself *sheepish grin*.

      The thing with being almost a complete stranger to a place with no friends and no family (not to mention no sweetie) to spend your weekends with, is that you’re forced to meet other people outside your “normal” circle.  Bel* and I met up to eat at Flame It in Ayala Mall (where else? It’s the only mall within my comfort zone as of the moment). I wolfed down one burger with wasabi and garlic cream cheese toppings (reminiscent of my previous birthday lunch, haha) and watched Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. I’ve always loved watching Lindsay Lohan in Parent Trap but I must say that the movie didn’t do her justice, to be the least kind about it.  After rummaging through racks and racks of fashion magazines in a used books and magazines shop, we had coffee at Bo’s (even though I swore off coffee a lifetime ago) to bitch and blab about life in general. Then we met up with Winston, Bel’s gay friend.  Winston is not your typical screaming gay. At first glance, he just looks like a typical 25-yr. old male wearing a black shirt with a bold silver Chinese character in front and denim pants. Judging from the haircut he was sporting, it was easy to surmise that he’s probably an avid fan of Dao Ming Ze in Meteor Garden.  But, when I asked what he did for a living, he nonchalantly replied, “I’m a cotourier”. Now that gave him away. Probing further, I learned that his expertise lay in designing wedding gowns and he has a team of seamstresses to put his sketches into life. Majority of his clients are Filipino-Chinese matrons from Cebu and other neighboring islands such as Iloilo.  Due to Winston’s presence perhaps, Bel and I were suddenly struck by the artistic bug. We spent the rest of the afternoon scouring bead shops and accessories stalls in the mall and buying the most colourful beads we could get our hands into (me, to make into jewelry and Bel, to incorporate into her new hobby – making beaded paintings). I am finally at home with the artistic types, whopee!  By dinnertime, our artistic family grew to include Sheila, Bel and Winston’s friend who’s an interior designer. We had an interesting conversation about furniture shopping, feng shui and horoscopes over iced tea, mango crepe and coffee at East West (you know who ordered the iced tea!).  Before the night was up, Shiela’s mom, sporting a loud pink outfit with matching shoes and bag, arrived to join us. She could be Cebu’s version of Imelda Marcos except that her well-coifed hair was a tad too blonde. She spent the rest of the night with endless stories of how she was going to decorate her new spa (the walls will be painted with a very pale coral pink – I wouldn’t have guessed!).  Our conversation drifted to ways of beautifying a 120-sq. meter vacant space which is about to become a spa. Art deco, paintings, flower arrangements, wallpapers and ornaments can really get four women and a gay excited and animated all through the night.  So if, in the future, people ask you what made me ditch a dull banking job to pursue a more colorful artistic career, you know the story to relay *smile*.   *Bel - a friend introduced to me by Jerese, a high school friend who's already married and based here in Cebu. Jerese probably figured out that since we're both single people living far away from home we could click as friends.

      Remember I said I was a 27 year-old lounge singer wannabe? Yesterday morning, while Papa Carl and I were on our way to work, I saw this sign posted along one of the streets we normally pass through - “Center for Pop Music #234-1120”. Unbeknownst to Papa Carl, my eyes began to twinkle like those of a little kid’s who had just discovered where mommy hid the cookie jar. I could practically hear the wheels in my head turning, “There’s a Center for Pop Music here in Cebu? Cool! Quick – better memorize the number discreetly before we make a right turn!”  So as my driver was smoking his way into oblivion, I was hatching my own plans for stardom.  Why not? I had just finished my MBA (sans the thesis) and my weekends are practically devoted to purely hedonistic pursuits. Plus, I’m reeaally potentially the next Regine Velasquez trapped in a banker’s body. Really.  Although my singing experience is mostly limited to intermittent videoke sessions, I’ve had my public singing debut during my brother’s wedding reception in May last year where I did a more-than-decent rendition of “Zoom” with my equally aspiring diva of a sister.  I don’t think our audience really understood what we were “zooming” about but the robust claps afterwards more than made up for the late nights my sister and I spent belting out the song over and over again.  Star In A Million, here I come! (Is there a category for singers in their late 20’s?)   Oh, well. Abangan…

      8 – 8:30 am – arrival in Kulitibank’s basement carpark via Papa Carl’s green AUV.  8:30 – 9 am – breakfast at Bo’s / Starbucks (if I wake up late and I’m not able to chow down some Continental / Portuguese / American / British / Filipino breakfast at the hotel).  9 – 10 am – check e-mail, send out e-mail, read Business World, Inq7, Bloomberg, CNN, check out stock prices at Bpitrade or PSE website.  …while doing this, clients drop by my desk no matter how hard I try to duck behind my laptop monitor. They do this to ask me extremely interesting questions like:   Where’s the CR?  Is there an internet café in Ayala Mall? (for the life of me, I don’t know why I even answered this question. I should’ve replied, “Do I look like the Ayala Center Information Desk to you? Do I? Huh? Do I?).  Miss, panu ku I fill up ang kwaan ang depusit slep?   Hi, can I sit here?  Hi Miss, may problima ang akong ATM, murag….(then the client launches into a litany of Bisaya words and poor dazed and confused me tries to pick up bits and pieces of similar sounding Ilonggo words – Help!)  Excuse me, Kulitibank sent me the wrong info on my bank statements! Look at this! I got debited for…blahblahblah, yakkitydakdak! I can sue the bank for misposting this!!! (Talk to the hand! Just kidding. Cool and very professional me desperately looks for the Greeter* who’s actually the one responsible for handling this headache).    10 – 11 am – call up existing / prospective clients for local and offshore investment alternatives so that Kulitibank can continue to pay the sky-high salaries of Matrix Boss, Olive Oyl and Capo di Tutti Capo** at the expense of harhardworking people like me.   11 – 12 am – I stop calling because people are starting to think that I’m actually a credit card agent (my heart goes out to them!).  12 – 130 pm – Lunch, yay! (and I’m out of the branch faster than the speed of light…)   *Greeter – the first person you see when you enter any one of Kulitibank’s branches. The first time I heard of this title I almost thought it was a joke. But then again, brandishing, “I am paid to greet people everyday,” is actually a cool way of starting conversations with strangers in parties. After which, the conversation should just stop there (haha!).  **Capo di Tutti Capo – boss of all bosses in mafioso lingo. She’s THE Queen Mother in Kulitibank-Philippines.

      Just had to post these interesting excerpts from a series of trivia I received yesterday via e-mail. A disclaimer: I disavow any knowledge of truth in these statements. B.S. or not, will readers of my blog let me know if these are true?  "In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had consent of the King (unless you were in the Royal Family!). When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the King, the King gave them a placard that they hung on their door while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K. (Fornication Under Consent of the King") on it. Now you know where that came from.   In Scotland, a new game was invented. It was entitled Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden....Thus the word GOLF entered into the English language."  I'll never be able to think of F.U.C.K. and G.O.L.F the same way again.

      I’m currently typing this in the office on a rainy afternoon while listening to an MP3 of Dido’s Thank You and wishing I were in Jamaica instead of Siberia a.k.a. Kulitibank-Cebu Branch (from where I sit I know now how it feels like to be in the Ice Age). Lest you think that we’re converting our office into an afternoon music bar, I’m letting you know that my headset’s on. This is actually not allowed in the workplace but Matrix Boss* is having a grand time somewhere in the U.S. east coast with her family. When the cat is away the mouse will puh-layyy, yeah! *grin*  Listening to music on a cold, rainy afternoon is a bliss. Add a cup of steaming coffee, F. Sionil Jose’s Ermita (which I have read once and would like to read again) and a king-sized bed I can sink myself into and this would have been perfect! Nah, on the other hand, perfect would be me, my sweetie, two cups of steaming coffee, a DVD of the Lord of the Rings series and a really nice entertainment system. Gee, that would be the closest I can get to heaven in this lifetime. But – zoom back to a cold, hungy and lonely me typing away at the only loyal friend I’ve known since I got here (that would be my company-issued laptop) and I must say that yep, reality bites.   I’m actually looking forward to cocooning again (my friend Val said that having a blog is the mark of a true couch potato – I’m proud to be one, actually *smile*)  Anyway, my usual after-office routine in the hotel goes:  Turn on TV and switch channel to TV Patrol (the night before I usually watch HBO / Cinemax / AXN or when in a jologs mood, any Tagalog movie on Campus Video, before sleeping).  (---Have to go now. Papa Carl, my driver and verbal sparring partner in Kulitibank , just called and said we’re leaving already. He picks me up from my hotel and brings me back there after work everyday. He’s actually a dear for doing that but I’m getting tired of holding my breath while he smokes himself to death inside the car.---)  I’m back in the hotel (and safe from the aging effects of second-hand smoke, what a relief!). To continue my after-office routine…  Change into official sleeping attire and fix stuff for tomorrow.  Eat dinner (usually delivered from the hotel café**, otherwise, it’s some healthy take-out from any of the stalls in Food Choices).  Switch back and forth between Extra Challenge and Star Circle Quest (which was replaced by Victim yesterday) while eating dinner.   Read Yahoo mail, check Friendster and surf the internet while watching any movie on TV (thank God for prepaid internet cards – they’re the best thing man has ever invented!).  Read book (currently The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield, swiped from the family’s book collection in Iloilo).  Watch HBO / Cinemax / AXN or, when in a jologs mood, Campus Video (which is doing reruns now of Booba) before sleeping.   *Matrix Boss – not my real boss. Olive Oyl, the real El Capo, used to say, “I am your head but matrix to ***** because she’s the Branch Manager and you’ll be assigned in her branch.” Coming up with a codename for Matrix Boss was a no-brainer.   **When staying in Richmonde Plaza Hotel in Cebu, make sure NOT to order anything with ketchup/mayo dressing. It’s the yuckest thing I’ve ever tasted. Try the Spicy Chicken or the Chicken Diablo – they can rival any of Wolfgang Puck’s poultry dishes.

      1. Learn something new everyday (such as how to make your own blog, teehee).  2. Never attempt to bribe the guard with a Jollibee meal (Barnie’s* mistake!).  3. Always cover your ass (a variation of: if you have to do something wrong, do it right).   4. Be friendly to your next-cubicle neighbor. She has the power to incriminate you.  5. Bring your own utensils (and never swipe someone else’s coffee mug).  6. Avoid office gossips like the plague!  7. Take long lunches only on Fridays.  8. What you don’t know can actually kill you.   9. Your boss may be dispensable but the banking circle is small. Go figure.  10. You can never be friends with everyone in the office (I’ve given up on that a long time ago. The Vatican will never beatify me!).   *Barnie – not his real name; a former officemate kicked out of Kulitibank for lying, bribing and for committing all sorts of minor corporate crimes.

      Idleness breeds creativity. For instance, last Saturday I literally had nothing to do except for a dinner-date with a high school friend and her hubby (talk about being a third wheel!). Another day in the hotel would have sealed my fate in a mental asylum. So after eating a quick lunch at the hotel café (Prices are a lot more reasonable than those in Manila hotels. Coffee for instance is a steal at 15 bucks!), I decided to head off to Ayala Mall.  Fifteen very short minutes later, I found myself ogling various beaded jewelry in one of the center kiosks in the mall. Having nothing to do, I watched the tinderas skilfully maneuver strands of silver gauge wire and different swarowski crystals and semi-precious stones to make bracelets, dangling earrings and necklaces.  Fast forward to around 30 minutes later, I was in Simple Stitches asking for the prices of several jewelry-making paraphernalia. I bought a pair of round-nose pliers and a wire cutter at True Value for a total of P500. I almost did not buy the pliers and the cutter which I know cost no more than P40 in Divisoria Mall but by then, I already had meters of silver gauge wire to last me a lifetime and several packets of crystals, stones and beads.  I spent the entire Sunday making a grand total of --- one necklace and one pair of dangling earrings. The effort was, ahem, worth it. Anyway, rather than sound boastful over my creations, I’ll just post a picture here as soon as I figure out how to upload (which will be soon, I promise!).  Oh, and another thing. This blog was likewise born out of sheer idleness and boredom. Now, THAT’s what I call a spark of ingenuity! =)

      Placehunting in Cebu  As most of you know, I’ve recently been assigned by Kulitibank* in Cebu. This entry is actually one of dozens of my strange encounters with potential landlords/ladies/roommates:  Over the phone…  Glenville: Fully furnished ho ba yung place nyo?   Landlady: Ah oo, fully furnished.   Glenville: Ah, ok. May tv, ref, aircon na ho ano?  Landlady: Wala. Merong cabinet, bid na kahoy pero wala pa yung foam kayu pa ang mag pruvide nun, and meron nang ilictric fan.  Glenville: Ha? Akala ko ho ba fully furnished?  Landlady: Oo nga. Fully furnished, yung ano, yung hindi bare! (Ang tanga ko, grabe!)  Glenville: Uhmmmm….gano ho kalaki yung room?  Landlady: Ah malaki!   Glenville: Ibig ko ho sabihin, in terms of square meters, gano po siya kalaki?  Landlady: Yun nga, malaki! Kasya isa pang cabinet and pwidi dalawang tao dito!  Glenville: (pagkatapos ng buntonghininga…) So, magkano po yung rent every month?  Landlady: Six thousand five hundred feesus. (Susmaryoseeef! Kamag-anak ata to ni Eddie Gil eh!)   *Kulitibank – a local bank pretending to be a multinational bank

      Sorry, this is my 3rd blog for the day. You have to forgive me because yesterday I posted my very first blog entitled – drumroll please – “and this is just the beginning”…However, I encountered a couple of formatting glitches and had to repost the pioneering blog again today. But rest assured I left all the words in their original state save for my age (Dammit, I was 26 yesterday!).  Anyway, I just had to write this down. Over lunch, I celebrated my birthday – alone. My usual office lunch companion, Papa Carl, ditched me. So after I gave hints to my last client for the morning that I may look chubby but I actually needed to eat, I headed off to Ayala Center Mall to look for a place where I could treat myself to a sumptuous lunch.   A background first: my sister and I decided to become total health buffs when Papa passed away last year due to pancreatic cancer. All the endoscopic videos, medical literature and doctors’ advice left us traumatized for life: we decided never to touch instant noodles, softdrinks, barbecued red meat and canned goodies, among others, for the rest of our lives. Our normal fare would include heapings of green leafy veggies and lotsa fruits. We seldom eat beef and pork anymore.  So you can understand why I decided to treat myself to a quarter pounder flamed burger w/ wasabe and garlic cream cheese filling plus a tall glass of Pepsi. It was sinfully delicious and the guilt was worth every bite!  So now you also know why I just had to write about it. Guilt and rationalization neutralize each other out. Ang kokontra pangit!

      Nobody here knows that it’s my birthday today because I am a newbie in the office. And I can’t be any happier! Not that I am evading my blow-out responsibilities (ok, ok, I admit I am a little bit on the kuripot side) but I want to extend my much enjoyed office anonymity and hence, my peaceful co-existence with my officemates just a little bit longer.  People have this tendency to mercilessly talk about clueless new hirees like me over lunch. Staying away from the limelight is actually my own defense mechanism against innocently delivered office gossips. Call me paranoid but they might be saying things like:   The new hire is a dumdum. IC should actually stand for Idiotic Consultant instead of Investment Consultant. Ahahahahaha!   Look at her shoes! Soooo baduy! (Left most of my Imeldific office shoes in Manila you moron! I only brought 3 of my Manolo Blahnik-inspired Janilyns!)   She slept her way to the top (in reality, applicable only to Hollywood starlets but allow me to be melodramatic today since, you guessed it, it’s my birthday!).  Gawd, she’s like a breath of fresh air in the middle of a Payatas dumpsite!  Everything about her is a fake, thanks to modern technology and cosmetic surgery (now that, actually, is a compliment).  Does she know what she’s getting into? Welcome to HELL! (woohoo!)  She looks like Michael V.    That does it. I’m back to my invisibility cloak!

      To be a little bit on the traditional side, indulge me with a self-introduction on my first blog. I'm a 27 year-old lounge singer wannabe (my fallback just in case this banking career doesn't take off soon) in the midst of a 2nd quarter life crisis. Hence, this blog. Enough said.  Borrowed this from my sister's blog (plagiarized likewise from someone else but hey, this IS a free country and this IS the Philippines):  If you call me Glenda, then you were my highschool / college classmate.  If you call me Glendon, you are Ivy.  If you call me Honey, then you are TinTin.  If you call me Glinda, then you are Zet's Dad.  If you call me Ula, Ang Batang Gubat, you are one of my college barkada who climbed Mt. Banahaw with me during one of our October semestral breaks years ago.  If you call me Glends, then you probably need something from me.  If you call me Sweetie or Pangga, then you are my cute and huggable Sweetie (I gave my lovelife status away!).  If you call me Mrs. P****a (asterisks mine to protect my identity from my would-be stalkers when I get famous in the future), then you are either the bellboy, the concierge or the receptionist in the hotel where I'm staying right now.  If you call me Ganda, then you are Mindy.  If you call me Mare, you are either Kim, Jeanette, Carla or Sheryll.  If you call me Lola, then you are Robby, Agnes or Cris.  If you call me Hollywood Supernova, then you are my gay friend, Denni.  If you call me Inday, you are either my sis, my mom or my brother (It's a term of endearment in Ilonggo, I swear!).  If you call me darling, then you definitely are my Mom!  If you call me Ate Blends or Blenders, then you are either Vi, Marj or Grace.  If you call me Inday Glenda, you are one of my aunts and uncles in Iloilo.  If you call me Manang Inday, NO, you are NOT my amo, but you're most likely to be one of my younger Iloilo cousins.  If you call me Glendy, then you are either Mallie, Pam or Carol.  If you call me a Michael V. lookalike, then you are a DEADMEAT! (Someone kindly told me that years ago and I'm still in the process of tracking her down...)

      The loonies in Kulitibank have been trying to pry my PHMNL password from me for weeks since I resigned. I have no idea what PHMNL means but giving access to it is practically like handing over a gun to someone who wants to assassinate me.   Why they want to get it is beyond me. The only thing remotely related to incriminating evidence they will find in my corporate email inbox are my work-related angsts, my pictures and my MP3s. Name one person in Kulitibank who doesn’t have any of the three in his PC and I will gladly write William Hung’s name using my butt.    Operation: Get Password  was carried out by Cruella de Ville, Oilve Oyl's sneaky and manipulative sidekick. Cruella is officially the “Junior IC” (a.k.a.  alalay ) but more often than not, she’s Olive Oyl’s hatchet woman.    Attempt No. 1  (On my cellphone)  Cruella: Heeeey, you know what, I can’t access the files in the laptop you surrendered…  Glenville: Naturally, Cruella. That’s because you don’t have my password.  Cruella: Yah, I know. But I just wanted to delete your files like what I did for Rose when she resigned.  Para clean siya .  Glenville: You can have it reformatted by the IT people. Everything’s gonna be wiped out.  Cruella: But…  Glenville: At this point, I really don’t want to give anyone my password. I am accountable for it and giving it to another employee is tantamount to violating the policy that I am not supposed to let anyone know of my password. (Capiche? Besides, I know who sent you. Go back to kissing Olive Oyl’s ass!)  Cruella: Ok.   Attempt No. 2  (A week later)  Cruella: Hi there! The IT guys can’t crack the PHMNL access. They can’t reformat your laptop either.  Glenville: Really? What if I forgot my password, then the laptop is useless? The IT people have administrator functions. They should be able to access and reformat my laptop even without my password. I guess the IT guys should be working as call center agents… (I am not a techie but I am not a dum-dum either)  Cruella: Oh, ok.   Attempt No. 3  (The truth unravels…)  Cruella calls me up on a Sunday evening warning me of Olive Oyl’s evil intentions  kuno .  Cruella: Hello, I just wanted to warn you.  Glenville: Warn me of what? (That your brain cells are actually working?)  Cruella: No, it’s just that I think Olive Oyl wants to snoop around your files. She told me that she wanted to look for something she can pin you down with.  Glenville: But why? I resigned already. Isn’t she happy?  Cruella: I think she wants to cover her tracks.  Glenville: Because she’s in a hot seat?  Cruella: I guess so. Three new hirees have resigned for the past 6 months, including you. A senior IC asked to be transferred to another department and another semi-senior IC has just resigned to join another bank. I think she can justify the others’ moves but not yours. So she’s looking for a justifiable reason for your resignation in your files.  Glenville: Oh, I see. She wants to look for something she can blame me with so that it will look like her hands are totally clean.  Cruella: You should really give me your password so that I can delete your files before Olive Oyl gets to them. I really want to help you. (Warning bells! It’s not really in Cruella’s nature to help)  Glenville: No, thanks. I have nothing to hide anyway. Let Olive Oyl try to access my files. I think I even forgot what my password was already.  Cruella: You sure about that?  Glenville: Yep, thanks anyway.  For the record, all my files have been deleted, purged, emptied. I never told Cruella because I wanted her and Olive Oyl to go nuts trying to find a way to get my password. In the meantime, I am getting gas at holding in my laughter. Loonies.

      The one bad thing about being unemployed is not being able to allow myself to take advantage of the great Mango mid-year sale. Sure, I can spare a few thousands but spending my entire savings on marked-down MNG bags, shoes and shirts will leave me eating Skyflakes for breaky, lunch and sup for the next few weeks or until I find meself a decent job. Not to mention that the guilt will eat me up like the golden kuhol slowly gnawing away at the waterlily in our backyard pond in Magsaysay Vill (how’s that for descriptive writing? teehee).   No work = No money = No luxury (except for a few fashion magazines, a massage/body scrub here and there and expensive beads for my accessories hobby).  Anyway, the point is, poverty sucks. Which led me into thinking, if I die, how will my last will and testament look like? My mom will absolutely freak out if she knows I’m writing this because she’s so superstitious about people mentioning the D word. Come to think of it, she’s superstitious about anything and everything! But that merits another blog sometime.  Here goes:  Glenda P****a’s Last Will and Testament  1.My old coin collection (some dating as far back as 1910, can you believe that?) I will leave to my sister so that she can make a fortune out of it someday and buy herself a Prince Charming. Or she can use the proceeds to take a cruise to the Caribbean so that she can flaunt her hot pink knit bikini (which she absolutely cannot wear anywhere else in the Philippines) and snag herself a Prince Anything. 2.My perfumes to my Mom to that she can still pass them on to her grandchildren since she hardly uses any perfume we give her anyway (save for “special occasions” like her birthday). 3.My eight journals (kept since twelve) to my sweetie to cheer him up during down days. The entries are spiced up with grammatical errors and exaggerated, if not surreal, accounts of my childish lovelife and encounters with strange people over the course of 15 years. 4.My Bistro Americano/Bistro Italiano discount card, free egg roll China Monk card, Bennigan’s discount card, Guess VIP Card and a lot of other freebie cards I leave to my gimmikera friend, Tin Tin.   5.Lastly, I leave my swarowski and beaded earrings, bracelets and necklaces to my Mom, sister and sister-in-law so that they can continue to look fab even during my wake.

         Fresh from a one-week vacation in Iloilo, I am still reeling at a few (well, ok, several) pieces of cheap thrills I have discovered in my native hometown. To be re-acquainted with the long-forgotten jologs in me was actually such a liberating experience.       Of course, let's start off with the pirated adage, “When in Iloilo, speak as the Ilonggos speak.” So, instead of saying oil, I would say, “ uweel ” to  Manang  Mila, the household help, as is the norm. When my mom asked me to drive her over to “Bee Gees” to buy Chinese medicine for her cough, I honestly thought the store's name was patterned after the famous singing group. I just had to contain my laughter when I finally saw the sign “Big J's” in front of the store where my mom went in. During my entire one-week stay, we would often go to “Bee Gee's” to buy serious medicinal stuff.       Consequently, when I was having menstrual cramps, I had to take  rosas de baybayon , a local herbal remedy which can cure a host of other illnesses such as myoma, urinary tract infection, cyst, cancer and goiter, according to the bottle's label. I don't know about the other illnesses but as far as my cramps went, I even forgot I had my period just a day after taking the capsules.       I also got a P60 mani-ped (when anywhere else in Makati, it would have set me back by an average of P200 in a respectable salon) and a P50, one-hour massage, courtesy of  Manang  Mila, who was so happy with my “tip” she even made me ginger tea!         Tagalog soaps were also a daily staple for me while in Iloilo as the TV set in my mom's room (where I stayed) could only cover Channels 1 to 13. Though she had cable connection, the TV remote's cable function wasn't working. And so, it was either IBC 13, RPN 9, Sports Channel, etc. Tagalog soaps won, hands down!       And to top it all off, I had an aquamarine gown (to be worn in a friend's wedding, where I'll be an emcee) made for only P1,437.50! Labor was P1K and  tela  was only P437.50. Mama convinced me to have one made there by her  suki  seamstress, Nelia, and the result was worthy of the Oscar's (no kidding!).          My brother's friendster profile says that he's from Iloilo – the land of P15 beer and P99 buffet. I say it's the land of the P60 mani-ped and P1,437.50 Oscarish gowns. Iloilo rocks!
