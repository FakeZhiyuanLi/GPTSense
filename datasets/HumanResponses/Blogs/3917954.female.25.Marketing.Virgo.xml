      This is my first blog.  I hope I have the courage to do this again.  Today the O.P. was served to my "husband".  He had been evading for about a week now.  It's been six years and he won't let go. He won't allow me to live in peace, all while using religion as his backbone.  It's almost a helpless feeling to be followed, called 15 times a day, text messaged, emailed.  It's eerie how technology can make someone so powerful and weak.  Well, it's up to the judge now.  I know it is just a piece of paper.  If he really wanted to hurt me he can do it anyway.  But, I'm not scared about that.  I am not afraid of dying.  I believe when it is your time to go, one way or another you will.  Why be afraid of that?  My parents can help him all the want.  They never wanted me to be born anyway.    I finally appreciate the fact that I am  woman at age 25. I just wanted to have a penis, so I can be treated respectfully and equally.  I remember the first time I realized my life was already decided for me.  I was five years old.  I was wearing a little purse to school, personally I thought it looked cute and made me feel older.  I never had many friends.  So, when a group of the "cool" girls asked me why I always wore a purse, I lied to them.  Funny thing, I didn't have the courage to  lie with my mouth, so I wrote it on a piece of paper.  I told them it was so important to have it with me because my boyfriend's letters were in them.  But of course I had to refuse to show them, because there weren't any.  As innocent and silly as that was, my parents found that piece of paper.  That was one of the first beatings I remember.  It was instilled in me that I have no right to date.  I can never even think about talking to a boy in that way.  I was going to marry someone of their choosing and he had to be Muslim, more importantly Pakistani, and even more likely a cousin.   I didn't know what depression was until my late teens.  But, I feel that I can successfully diagnose myself with depression since that moment.    I remember the day that I "became a woman", the day I got my first period.  It was one of the worst days of my life.  I was 11 when it came.  After that point no wearing of shorts or tank tops.  No playing with boys, which was tough because I was a tom-boy.  Everything was taken away.  No phone calls, no going to friends houses.  No one coming over.  No hanging out after school.  No sports.  No life. I was allowed to go up and down my block (not even around).  I couldn't be on the phone for more than 5 minutes, without someone eaves dropping.   Control.  That is a strong word.  That was what they wanted.  My father.  My mother. My older brother. If words didn't work, the fist did. But, so they thought...  It's a strange feeling writing this story about my life.  It sounds like I am talking about someone else.  All of this didn't happen to me.....
