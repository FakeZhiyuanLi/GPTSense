      today i was feeling bad, or rather still am.  played a joke on student, simply said "boo" and he attacked me.  literally.. he's really fucked up beyond belief. he had shoved me to the ground and started punching.  simply a decent day but messed up..

      i had a good time at the boat satuday night, invited sydney and lindsey from sea hunter over to watch a movie. we were just having a blast.. laughing left and right.  eventually we settled down and watched a movie, with them by my side.. it was quite comfy.  then they went back to their boat with me walking them.. you know in case any sea monsters come up.. haha.  pretty much lindsey had to go to bed but we walked around.. even danced some.. you should see my loop-de-doop.  anyway had a great time! wish more of my life was like that..

      it was a great weekend, it's just something that doesn't come along often.  from what I've seen in the last few days, my life's defiantly getting better and better.  my friend's sammie and kara sent me some pictures, so now I have something to remember them by.  i've talked with alot of people on eSPIN.. it's honestly been a great weekend.
