      Some times it’s amusing to see what web sites look good and which do not. It was really interesting when looking for a college all the design schools had really bad web sites. Later it became obvious that no school uses its design department to do actually design work for the school. Possibly this is just because the accounting department will want to have a look at the books as well but even still students have always seemed like a great work force on unleash on a school practical problems.  Just now a trip over to  urlLink W3C  was very shocking. No, they do not have a new site design, but after looking at websites about site design, and ones that look very good at that, it was amazing to see how badly the W3C is designed. It’s literally painful to look at as it doesn’t look good and seems to be haphazardly organized.  This might not seem like a big deal to some people but for those who don’t know the W3C have taken it in to their hands to create standards for HTML, CSS, XML and the whole forest of acronyms the Internet has grown. The W3C are, literally, the experts in these languages and maybe they could get a couple of volunteers to spruce the place up.

       urlLink Adaptive Path  has a look into why some design firms give their web sites to out side statistics organizations to discover if what they made is useable. They argue that usability should be kept to the design house with people who knows what is trying to be achieved and will be able to come up with more innovative solutions to problems as they arise.  It is always interesting reading about industry standards and practices. At the esteemed  urlLink TCNJ  websites are not a large part of the curriculum. Eeking out two classes of web was a bit more maneuvering then one would like. Though out of those two classes there is no talk of usability testing by Q&A and anonymous tests there is testing as you go. Though this mostly comes out of their practices in other classes where critiques are on going in the creation process and simply flows in to the other classes. Unless this boring, sterile practice better suited to non-designers was discussed through the first few sleepy days of Web Design 1, ALT 255 does not remember such ways to discover usability.   This method cannot be used too much as why would the client care as long as it does what they want. It will be a sad day when they start asking to see the numbers to back a web site up.

      Like Mark Twain ALT 255 trys to never let school get in the way of education. Graphic Arts is something that definitely falls in that category. As a growing graphic artist ALT 255 is an experiment to constantly learn about graphic arts. Poke it, prod it, or pull its pigtails ALT 255 will do what it takes to try and figure out what graphic arts is and where it might be going next.  And if ALT 255 is really lucky, maybe some one will even read it and learn, form an opinion, or just get angry. So let the experiment begin.

       Well I think it’s official. When it comes  urlLink to   urlLink the   urlLink leaders   urlLink of   urlLink industry  they web has been standardized and so have a large portion of their followers. I include my self in that category even though I have yet to finish standardizing this site to begin with. I have the want to standardize to have my peers in web design accept me.   This  urlLink web site review by François Briatte  shows that after standardization we have resolved to nit picking. 80% of the links are underlined. How does that effect usability?  urlLink Jakob Nielsen  has the answer.  Since when were we all in the  urlLink Bauhaus  with  urlLink Paul Rand ?   Not that it’s bad at all as simplicity in design is a wonderful ideal to try and achieve. Yet it seems like everyone is going for the same goal.  It was the great and legendary  urlLink Fanky Chak  of  urlLink The College of New Jersey  that really introduced me to the diametric opposites of  urlLink Paul Rand  and  urlLink David Carson . Both have such opposite styles yet archive such visual beauty. Where are the Carson’s of the Internet? Where is design communicating while still obscuring type?  Perhaps it is just that I feel a strong Carson influenced site would not score high on the usability list. I’m not sure that is true, but as I try and think of ways to mess with type and integrate it with images while still keeping standards intact I am having a hard time.  urlLink David Carson’s own site  doesn’t seem to help as I still have not figured out how his site works.  With the Bauhaus seeming to come in to full-blown swing will we see a revolt? Will people throw some standards out the window and challenge users to think? We can only wait and see.

      The Pathfinder pallet is one of those Illustrator pallets that unless explained to you it can be a little difficult to figure out how it works. The Illustrator help file gives a basic over view of how it works but just by experimenting it is not always obvious what the tools in there actually do.     One of the most useful tools is the Subtract from Shape Area tool. This tool takes the front most object and subtracts it from the backmost object when 2 objects are selected. This allows anything in the background to show through. This is important if any white areas in the illustration are just supposed to be whatever color the background is instead of the ink color white.

      As a preliminary post, I’d like to discuss an intriguing aspect of design, one which is often overlooked and easily forgotten or even unnoticed and unappreciated.  As a graphic design student, I often look to various sources for inspiration for designs, keeping an eye out for aesthetically pleasing devices.  Sources include nature, machinery, and music, but also in the area of film.     Most often, people go to the cinema, watch the film, and toward the end, as soon as the “Directed By…” text flashes across the screen.  It’s up, leave the spilled popcorn, and out to the parking lot to find your car.  There’s little care for those talented individuals who actually put their time and effort in to make the visual and audio craftsmanship that goes into making a motion picture.  Yesterday, with my sister, I had the good pleasure of seeing Alex Proyas’s unique Sci-Fi thriller I, Robot.  While the movie was exceptional, in its style and pace, one of my favorite parts was the end-credits!  Sure enough, the first credit displayed, the music came to a crescendo, and the theater was cleared before the cast list even finished crawling up the screen.  My sister and I sat, giving credit where credit was due.  It was in those few moments in reading the many Visual Effects companies and their workers that I noticed the typeface used in the credit text.  Such a remarkable font, very different from what I’d seen elsewhere, I debated whether the font was already in existence or was it created specifically for the film.  Colored in an electric blue, the font was sans serif, but in all caps.  Thin simple lines, but not condensed.  Graceful and pure, it appeared to have been carved through laser onto the screen.    The typeface reflected the futuristic minimal nature of much of the film’s motifs. The set designers said it right when they suggested, “We’re making a documentary of the future,” not the typical silver and blocky nature often seen in other Science Fiction films.  The film itself had remarkable visuals, very different from other Sci-Fi genre films, such Star Wars or Trek, but more like that of Minority Report with a mature appreciation of how aesthetics would develop with the increased use of technology.  Given the fact that the movie is only set 30 years into the future, we see a connection between design of our Modern Day, and let’s say where design would go 50 years down the road.  I thought it was interesting how, as our modern culture shifts to a more minimalist idea of design, this movie takes the idea that we continue on that route, but also take a step back into detail for the sake of interest.  This reflects the movie’s theme that humans can try to be more efficient and robot-like, but still revive our humanity through personality and taste.  Now I want to know where I can get a model of Will Smith’s “new-hotness” Audi!

         I enjoy finding new sites and promoting them. The hardest part of any new site is getting the word out and getting people to become regular visitors.         urlLink Funfurde  is a good collection of new and interesting furniture design. The design of the site is oddly reminiscent of the clean  urlLink gizmodo  design as seems to be popular these days. I’m not really a fan of overly wacky furniture designs though they are fun to look at.      Good luck to Funfurde!

          urlLink          While I am more liberal then conservative I’ve become very interested in these conventions. They really are a great place to see some truly heartfelt speeches from strong speakers. I look forward to the Republican convention for more strong speakers.                One thing is clear though. That is one large ass screen. And for such a large screen they really don’t seem to be doing much with it. With the speaker featured prominently in the center there is a lot of space on either side. Of course there is the waving flag in the background and the tried and true color swirls. These are all good background fillers but for such a large screen they should be getting more for their money. Some sort of graphs or montage to highlight the speeches given could have been good to fill the space.               I’m sure they did not want to take the focus away from the speaker but it seems there could have been some sort of festive graphics to get the crowd going. What would you have put on the giant democratic screen?

       urlLink Internet Explorer has started a Team blog . Larger corporations are definitely taking advantage of the blogger medium and what they post shows their corporate culture. This blog seems to be pretty energetic&nbsp;and should offer some good discourse. Does any one else think that  urlLink google's blog  is a little reserved? Little too much corporate polish for my taste.   IE's new team blog allows comments (something google does not) and I imagine they will get riped apart by some people but in the end it will probably very beneficial. That is if they can abstain from flaming back.   **Update**   urlLink jessey.net &nbsp;points out that the site does not even  validate as HTML 4.0 Transitional .

      We here at ALT don't get much traffic. It's a new site and I'm still trying to convince some of my friends and colleagues to throw in their 2 cents. We'll see if that ever happens. I seem to be adding content fine now but we'll see when my senior year of college starts with my other commitments.  urlLink Concerts  don't plan them selves you know.    Anywho, when some one does me the pleasure of stopping by I notice on  urlLink SiteMeter . A site called  urlLink Design Detector  stopped by and poked it's head in. Seems fairly new and any site that amasses design sites so I don't have to look for them gets an A in my book. So from one new site to another I welcome thee. It seems they don't offer a category for blogs. If you stop by put in a request for a category. Us bloggers can never be ignored for long.

      Who knows what is going on with the next iteration of Internet Explorer. Not to long ago, due to a post on  urlLink Design by Fire ,  urlLink Robert Scoble &nbsp;has said he would pass along some feature requests to the staff of IE. It seems Microsoft is being much more open about IE and are trying to talk to people to find out what they want. This is wonderfully as the word on every web designers mouth is “standards are god” except that IE seems to be an atheist&nbsp;since their standards support sucks. Yet even with all this openness the next I read is that  urlLink new versions of IE will only be released with new a OS (operating system).   &nbsp;  For those of you that’s are not rolling on the ground like they just got a really good kidney punch, let me explain. Internet explorer is up to version 6. Yet people still run internet explorer 5, or even 4. This is because it works fine for them and they see a need to change. Web designs know these people are out there and jump through hoop after hoop so these lazy people can view the web page in a pleasing way. This tends to hinder advancement of the web because every one is dumbing down their web site to work with older versions of browsers.  &nbsp;  You though people didn’t update their browser before, how about IE 7 and above which, to update your browser, will need a OS update that will cost over a hundred dollars. Corporations that run hundreds on computer will have to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars. Well browser update will grind to a halt. I know people that are still running Windows 95, people upgrade even less when it costs money.  &nbsp;  The hope is for any one reading is that every one will migrate over to  urlLink FireFox , or the  urlLink Mozilla  browser of their choice. I don’t see this happening until  urlLink Dell  starts shipping PCs with it installed. It’s a combination of laziness and simple computer illiteracy of the masses that will keep people stalled with whatever browser is on their OS.

       urlLink Andy Budd  has an organization going on called  urlLink Skill Swap . It’s an ingenious idea where design type people get together and teach each other what they know. Some cool People over at  urlLink Eris Free  pointed me to the wonderful idea.   I don’t know what I could teach others. It seems I am still at the point where I know little about many things but a lot about nothing. Even still I wanted to check it out and see what they are doing.   Being new to the design bogging sphere I am not innately aware of people’s locations.  urlLink Eris  boldly pronounces she is from Dallas Texas, but then who from Texas doesn’t boldly pronounce everything?  urlLink Andy , it turns out, is from  urlLink Brighton which is about 50 or so miles south of London . This way to far for this New Jersey native to go.   This got me thinking about designers and location. Surly there are designers in the New York/Philly area that blog. While having a world wide group of people to read is amazing it would also be amazing to be in contact with the blogging savvy in my immediate area.   Just poking around I have found little. I can find most anything on the web and it is only a matter of time before I put the puzzle together and find them. Who else has a group of local designers they look to? I can’t be the only one looking for local camaraderie.

       urlLink Graphic Push  has an article about  urlLink taking PowerPoint design seriously . While many do not want to think about having to put together PowerPoints as a living it's still good to know the standards and practices of any graphical tool.    With PowerPoint seemly everywhere how does this effect how information is seen? After just putting a PowerPoint presentation together for a school it’s very obvious how painful it can be to animate anything in that environment.    With Flash MX starting the way to be the next PowerPoint (at least in their eyes) will Microsoft set up and start adding some features that will take PowerPoint to the next level? It sure would make any designer using it happy if the damn thing was easier to make exciting. Those animations are painful.

      As a designer, we learn visually. No matter how much CSS, XHTML, or PHP a designer programs in the end we are visual people. With this in mind one of the many tutorials you can find online are video tutorials. These really are great inventions that quickly explain how too work the program in question. Most of the time they just cover the basics but for anyone trying to learn a program for the first time the basics are often the hardest thing to learn. Some of the best ALT knows about are  urlLink videos for Milk Shape 3D by Brian Hayes .  The thing about these video tutorials is that they were put together by people who not only knew the program they were talking about but how to record and capture these films. So, not to put them down, their voice was a bit dull and boring. Though no one was looking for anything but a clear voice to explain what to do. Enter  urlLink Designs By Mark . These video tutorials are not free but there are a few examples on his site. Give one of them a whirl and a wild and crazy man talking about Photoshop will quickly jar you awake.  Who is this guy marketing to? Designer do not want frills when they are looking for an easily understood answer are they? I can’t imagine who is buying these but I’m going back to the soothing voice of my techie friends.

      Designing any web site should be a learning experience, period. If you're just churning out the same web page every time it's safe to say you're not really challenging your self or the rest of the web. While ALT is never going to assume we are challenging the web in any way with our masterful layout but we do grow stronger with each attempt.   This time more advanced stylesheets was the attempt. CSS is wonderful unless you want it work in more then one browser. And more then one browser it will be viewed, as graphic artists are stubborn people that still use MACs, ug.  Anywho… to get it right we went to  urlLink Position Everything  and grabbed this very nice three column layout to get out selves started. It is a beautiful piece of work with all the hacks built right in. Never the less it still took a couple of hours to get it looking right, or at least to have it not look bad. It was much easier to test with a nice version of  urlLink FireFox  on the computer, since with all the hype about it how can you pass?  As is tradition the problem that came up was matching the image color with the background. There are two choices with this, go transparent or fix the color. Transparence is no picnic either and also with bugs from browser to browser. One-day  urlLink .png  will be a fully supported file format across the board, but not today.  Already having tried to get transparency to work, it was now time to, once again, try and get the colors to match. It was always baffling why Illustrator would say it's the right color and Photoshop to say it too but for the browser to disagree so adamantly. Having never really come across the answer, the decision was to just dive in and fix it.  It seems that when the images were brought in to Photoshop from Illustrator they loose their contrast. Image > Adjustments > Levels…   is the way to correct this off set. This handy tool lets you set the black, white, and gray of the image. This seemed to fix the problem and when I refreshed my page the colors matched exactly.

      There is  urlLink an article  over at The Atlantic about campaign ads and why they are so bad. People are not amused after they see these dry, uninteresting, and repetitive ad that have no right to be on TV. The real question is of course, why are multi-million presidential campaign ads so incredibly bad?  The article goes in to how fearful candidates are of messing up and how consultants, campaign managers, and even the candidates insist on having creative input. With reaction to ads measured and plotted it is boiled down to a science. Earlier today on  urlLink MSNBC  one of the men involved touted that it was a science and talked about the amount of user testing they do with slightly different versions of the ad. ALT does not know who is being subjected to political ads with a slightly different accent on that third paragraph or that different angle of the candidate in his hard hat, but we would like to extend our sympathies.  While John Kerry and George W. Bush are off metering the lights on their next commercial to get statistically good lighting, where are the designers that are actually making these atrocities? This just plays up to  urlLink an article  that was in Communication Arts but is featured on AIGA's own web site, which say that graphic artists need to design with the confidence that we know what we are doing. This is no reason any ad need to be committeed to death.  The is a light on the horizon though as MoveOn.org as well as other online sites have be pioneering privately made campaign ads that have design and idea in the forefront and statistics in a far second. Might candidates squelch at ads that are made better then their own? Perhaps, but in an age where many political decisions are based on polls and stats it is not looking likely.   Designers need to take responsibility for the drab boring ads they make and need to take charge in the creation process. The candidates have no reason to change their ways, but if the industry changes as a whole and enforces design principals in all they do candidates will have little lass to do then follow, kicking and screaming, to a future of interesting ads that attract attention and create a buzz.

      Here at ALT, we are not afraid to stretch a bit to make out content fit our mission. Though it's really not that much of a stretch it's better to warn you in advance so you don't get all riled up later, *wink*.  After just finishing, after a long day, reading a 35-part retelling of the historic  urlLink Clone Saga from the pages of Spider-Man . Something that many people know about but, it seems, few actually know the whole story. This article seems to have been written in 2001 so it's not a new endeavor but it would be rather painful to try and read this long article if you had to wait for their weekly/monthly publishing.   It was an amazing read as rarely are comic book arcs completely represented out side of comics. This is more then a retelling though as Glenn Greenberg give long, detailed, and painfully interesting tales from behind the sense. As much as this is a story about compete chaos and corporate politics, the behind the scenes that show how comic books really come together really show through.   What is really staggering is, honestly, the staggering size and detail of this history of Ben Reilly. Enough detail is given that Ben becomes an endearing character that you care about. This will make you long for these books to be TPBed so you can experience this great character. ALT can do little more then personally thank the two wonderful writers of these articles.

      In the UK two companies have started a  urlLink fight over the color orange . The cell phone company Orange and EasyJet’s new company EasyGroup both use orange as their primary and only brand identity color. The article goes over how several companies have defended specific colors when it is identified with a product or identity and might cause confusion to the consumer. While legally they do not “own” the color they effectively block out the color use from their competition in a specific market.  While it makes sense that a company would want to protect it’s identity, it would be interesting to see a situation where all the color choices were taken. Eventually issues like this will have to come up. If  urlLink GE decides it really likes all of it’s colors  and that costumers respond to them, are they going to try and defend all the colors? I’m sure it’s an unlikely situation to ever happen but it would be an interesting legal president if ever all the colors in the rainbow were defended as an identity.

      Well, this is a bit more of a question than some design revelation, so bare with me please. I'm currently doing some design work for the company where I have my summer job (big note: it is not a design company in any way). The work I'm doing is purely for the reason that I'd love to get any work I can to use for a portfolio and they're a bit too cheap to go to a design firm, either way, good for me. The problem is while I've been given the information and the go-ahead to design a product catalog, the many people that are reviewing it have some very odd preferences to what it should look like. Some suggestions are fine and don't bother me one way or another, but certain suggestions are very off the wall and I think to be very bad ideas for design (no specific examples except they seem to want me to use Word Art effects for headings). I have one coworker who at least has a good design sense that I discuss my work with, but otherwise, no one has any design experience. Does anyone have any suggestions? Do I try to convince these people that their ideas are not good design (I don't really feel like confronting them since they seem to be very set on what they think "looks good") or should I just pander to them and do whatever they want, risking the fact that I may not want to use this as portfolio work? Well, just needed to get this out there and hopefully this little venting will prevent me from killing someone with a mouse and keyboard.

      As this site tries to find it’s legs and create a voice for it self within the online community the format of the posts will change. I really didn’t want it to. I wanted to set up a professional style and get some Google Ad Sense going. Well I’ve given up on trying to keep a consistent style for now and I’ll just let it flow till we all find a style that works and excites us.   urlLink Speak Up  has a post by  urlLink Peter Scherrer  about  urlLink making deadlines . I have always been happy that I have finished my projects for class in whatever allotted time I have given my self. I know this bodes well for when I have clients and have to set and meet deadlines. Of course the article made me think of Jimmy Casa who never seems to make a deadline and rather have a perfect project then an on time one. That’s right Jim, I’m calling you out. So hopefully you’ll post some sort of response so when your future employs you he will read your wonderful explanation along side this scathing comment. I doubt you’ll have to much trouble explaining it away.  Though it might be unfair to call Jim out as he is the only one of the Contributors on the left that has actually fulfill that title.  p.s. it’s early and I’m a little cranky.
