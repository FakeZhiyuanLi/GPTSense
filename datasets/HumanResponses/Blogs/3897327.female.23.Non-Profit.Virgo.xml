Im a symbol of Islam & am proud of it. Neva a moment wld i wldnt me to b any diff. Islam is such a wonderful religion but e reality of it bein misunderstood is such a sad tin. e notion of religious tolerance has been destroyed by e few fanatics tt push them 2 commit tins tt, of cos, Islam doesnt preach. Islam becomes a misnomer, it is synomous wif anti-autre faiths, it is detestor by many, le malentendu. But is actual fact wat Islam holds has more 2 offer. I donn deny tt i do not know a lot but i wish to learn to feed je vide pauvre, to complete my missin self &amp; tt drives me...."      ok. bak to ja'histoire. aft PERGAS, came bak did some ironin & outs again to EP.

Al-hamdulilah.      so im bak now & yes Gilmore Gals has started so 2 surmise e day, 2 quotes:      "Je suis eMusulman et j'fier de ca!"      "Kamu semua adalah sebaik-baik ummat yg dilahirkan utk manusia, menyuruh kebaikan, mencegah kemunkaran &amp; beriman kpd Allah." (Ali-Imran: 110)
