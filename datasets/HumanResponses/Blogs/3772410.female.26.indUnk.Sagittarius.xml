          I'm having a hard time to learn to put cute things on the blog... I only found out how to upload pictures and... God... It was not easy...     I'm still trying to discover how to put emoticons... and make my own template.        Kisses...       P.S. Please people... say something...

          Well... I'd like to write something usefull... but as hubby said I'm not "that inspired" tonight. But I decided to start a "series" talking about the friends I made on the chats, and to not make anyone jealous, I'll go in a chronological line (my former college professors would be mad....).     But I'll start this tomorrow.

        Eshu. You are one of the great wanderers who spreads tales of epic battles, heroic quests, and love lost. You travel the world, the dreaming, and the stars in search of adventures and a good tale to weave. You know you are kings and queens of your own lands, and see no reason to bow to any sidhe. You follow your own rules. You are an artist of a dying craft, and you will spread your tales as far and wide as possible to keep the stories alive.      urlLink   What Type of Changeling Are You?

      Since august 2003, I started to play on chats. First New Bremen, then Devil's Macabre which was Deadly Games that time. Then Detroit... Obsidian, City of Shadows, Blood Chronicles, Atra Nox...  Most important than the games, are the friends. Now I have lots of friends, it would be unfair to say their names cause I would forget some for sure... But I want you all to know that you are a important part of my life. Thank you all. I love you.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Carol Mathews,&nbsp; I made Khadija Parker on NB and Francesca Gentileschi on Devils Macabre, which was Deadly Games on that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really made a lot of friends playing Khadija :) I'll talk about those I kept. First of them: Rodo. We talk everyday, and when I don't "see" him it's like something is missing. I think I see him almost as an older brother, though, he is younger than me. We can talk about everything... he is really well informed, sometimes he knows news about Brasil before me. And I'm glad that&nbsp; LÃ©lio and Rodo talk too, It seems that we know each other for a long time, like, a cousin that lives on another town. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is Mia too. We don't talk that much, but she is a person that I admire, she is firm. She says what she needs to say and she is brave. I wish we talk more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And tpo Joey, I think I don't know his name IRL. But he is a nice guy too, sometimes we have funny talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Playing Khadija I also met Javier, well, I met him while playing Andrea, but we became closer friends when I was playing Kay. He is so sweet... he also makes me feel better about things, I wish I had the same "effect" on him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Carlos, he is tpo Khadija's mate, Paul. I can't say much about him, we are not really close, but I hope we keep on touch.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I made Francesca to "try" the Deadly Games, she is&nbsp; a nilla mortal. And talking to Brady, he decided to make a char to play with her. He made a Mage, Jakar. And we have fun playing their family, they just had their second child, Angelica. And now they have to deal with two&nbsp; little children, and the natural jealous of the older son, Kyle.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love the way we play them. I love the way Brady deals with his "family". It shows how sweet he is.

        You have a mysterious kiss.  Your partner never knows what you're going to come up with next; this creates great excitement and arousal never knowing what to expect.  And it's sure to end in a kiss as great as your mystery.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided something. I decided to tell people all things. Good or Bad. Sometimes people hurt us and we wait... wait for them to realize they did... but they can't guess.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes it's just a misunderstanding that we can easyly solve. And the good things,&nbsp; people sometimes can't guess how much we like or how important they are to us if we don't say it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok.... it easier said than done...

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, my next char on NB was Carol Matthews, a Fianna kinfolk. She was also a cop, that was how I started to talk to Soren. With him and Mia.... as far as I remember I started to talk to Mia cause she was using Soren's MSN, then I started to talk to her, thinking it was him... But&nbsp; before that my husband told me had talk to her... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So... I feel like those "couple friends" that if we live on the same place, would visit each other and stuff. We really love you guys, you are cool, funny.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I'm playing with them on CoS. And I'm really enjoying the time I'm talking of them. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We love you two ; ) &nbsp;

      Well, today I cleaned the apartment... at least the bathroom. I had to send  my Lelios away to do that, it's impossible to get anything organized with them around. I made some bread later... but it caused me heartburn. A shame...

      The first friend I made on Digichat was Jeff, he used to play a GlassWalker on New Bremen, Frank Grimm. Our chars started to date and we started to talk on ICQ. later we transfered the chars to another chat, but I had problems with an ST and left. we still talk... sometimes.  Julia Messina was my first char on chats, she was a mortal on NB.  The second was Andrea Summers, on Andrea's skin I met Phil. I still talking to Phil :). Not as much as before though, but... it's like, well.. we still around. I played with him too when I was playing Karen, my Black Fury on NB, who died on an ambush. He was tpo my Alpha.

          Well, it would be unfair if I start by another person. He was not exactly the first friend I made on chat, he was more than that! Gabriel introduced me to the chats! He was the one who told me about New Breman. Later I payed the favor introducing him to Obsidian.     We met, in fact, when he moved to the town where I was born to study. We became friends RPing together, later I moved to the town I'm living now, and that was when I got addicted on chats... so... it's all this guy's fault!     Gabriel, you are a great friend, a funny guy, and I always enjoy to talk and RP with you, I'm really glad that you are ok now and back to action.     Kisses and hugs
