       I saw this article in the  urlLink Washington Post  about the lodges in our National Parks.  Being a guy in the hotel industry, I enjoy seeing the places that were built with the experience in mind (as oppose to the most efficient $$).  I am not a fan though of seeing Old Faithful with a possible whiff of the dumpster behind the nearby lodge.

       I saw this from a police site from my old hometown.  Sometimes the brain does not engage...  A 24 year old township resident was driving past the business owned by her family, All Seasons Door and Windows, when she saw a suspicious white box van parked next to the building. The woman pulled into the lot and confronted the defendant, Eric Morris. He stated to her, " I'm stealing aluminum, please don't call the cops". He then began to unload the stolen aluminum from his truck and dump it on the ground. Ptl. John Breen and Ptl. Martin O'Neill arrived and arrested Eric Morris, who was still attempting to get the stolen aluminum out of his van.

       Being someone who has lost 80 pounds and has to be vigiliant to not gain it all back, I always keep my eye open for the good and bad on the shelf.  I have pulled away from pastas (I cannot remember the last pasta dish I have had) and try to keep my sugars at a minimum.  I think my sweet tooth is genetic due to the same look my father I get over ice cream cake.  There is however the studies.  Good sweetners... not so good... avoid these at all costs ones.  I saw this  urlLink link  about the current scientific point of view on substitute sweetners.  For me?  I go for the real thing, but not the super size with extra frosting and extra shavings on the top portion.

       My cousin has been on a hunt for decent track of land so that he could sustain himself on just farming.  He looks from state to state for a parcel of decent acreage to have his corner of the world.  I always enjoying visiting and seeing his operations.  He does not have the capacity of some  urlLink mega-farms , but I applaud him for cranking up the tractor after every Michigan winter.

       Why it is that certain people who are married and do nothing but complain about their spouses suddenly revise and soften their tone when they see that the camaraderie of the bashing is not being returned.  Several occasions recently, I have had people talk about their spouses in berating ways.  From the staples of "spends too much" to "always wants something", they never have anything nice to say.  When they ask me about my relationship, I am always answering in the positive.  Suddenly, it becomes "Well, it's really not that bad" or the "Oh, just you wait".  Being divorced, I have known times when all I did was vent.  Why should one do it because it is some stereotype of a sitcom husband-wife relations who have nothing better to say?

       ... a forwarded note from my brother-in-law...  Which Way the Young?   by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.  [Posted May 27, 2004]  A new poll shows 18–29 year olds turning against Bush, with 58 percent believing that the country is on the wrong track. This, however, doesn't translate into support for Kerry. In fact the margin of difference between support for either major candidate is negligible. What does seem clear is that the wave of student enthusiasm for the GOP that came about after Sept. 11 has subsided.  But since political polls are both tedious and intellectually vacuous, let's move on to the real question we should be asking: are students tending toward socialist thinking or free-market thinking as compared to the past? It is hard to discern this based on polls alone, because of the enormous confusion concerning the meanings of liberal and conservative, and left and right. Any poll that stays within these conventions is likely to be misleading (even aside from all the other weaknesses of polling).  In the conventional view, to be politically leftist means to have faith in government at home but doubts about the same government abroad—at least that's what it means right now. Thus are the bookstores packed with riveting attacks on the Bush administration's foreign policy for attempting to use the state for messianic purposes in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with all the attendant evils that come with such attempts (lies, debt, death, and all the rest).  At the same time, the same political left decries the Bush administration for not having been messianic enough in its use of government power at home, where they believe the state should equalize incomes, provide free goods and services for one and all, and regulate commerce until it comes to a halt, which would supposedly yield great benefits for the environment.  So partisan have been the attacks that Bush gets no "credit" from socialists for having been the biggest spending president since LBJ. At some point in the future, however, the left may inaugurate Bush revisionism and decide (once he is safely out of office) that he wasn't so bad after all since he brought back government power after its decline in the 1990s—just as the political left discovered after the fact how much they owed to World War I for socializing the economy.  As for the political right and its current literature, we are supposed to be ever vigilant against "big government" unless of course it is the really very big government that seeks world empire in the name of spreading freedom and democracy. In this case—and probably only when the GOP is running the empire—we are supposed to believe every claim of the government, spend hundreds of billions without flinching, arrest dissenters, violate civil liberties, and possibly even draft people into military service. Such positions are said to be "right wing."  Is it any wonder that students become confused, especially when there is so little serious discussion of principled ideological issues in popular political literature? The essential message of most political books on the shelf is either: a) the Bush administration and its friends are fabulous and wonderful, or b) the Bush administration and its friends are liars, crooks, thieves, and murderers. Come to think of it, the same was true about 10 years ago, when all political books fell into the camp of either pro- or anti-Clinton.  There is nothing wrong with beating up the politicians in charge. It serves a good social function. But serious thought requires a more fundamental rethinking of the role of government in the world, whether at home or abroad, and the true meaning of human freedom.  The attacks on the World Trade Center in September of 2001 did prompt such thinking on the part of a generation of students, but not in a way that suits the cause of liberty. There was the crisis effect, which always seems to cause people to embrace power. There was the heralding of public service, which apparently these students accepted without question. Then there was the nationalistic impulse—among the basest emotions to afflict people—that was unleashed by the idea of swarthy foreigners murdering innocents and demolishing urban landscapes.  The government is always looking for something that appears more dangerous than itself, and these criminals seem to fit the bill. Never mind that it was the government that promised but failed to protect us. It was the government that prevented the airlines from protecting themselves. It was the government that so badly botched the rescue operations. It was the government that had stirred up the hate that led to the terrorism. And there was not much the government could have justly done to fix the problem after the fact, since the perpetrators were all dead.  Nonetheless, all these thoughts are stage two, and most students never went beyond stage one. Joshua Foer, writing for the New York Times, reminds us of how pro war this generation of college students became, and remained until last year, when polls showed far higher support for war among students than people over 30. Pro-war rallies were common on campus. Foer speculates why:     The class of 2004 grew up at a time when it was easy to have faith in the goodness of our government. Vietnam, Watergate and even Iran-contra were not a part of our direct political memory. For my generation, abuse of power meant sexual indiscretions in the Oval Office—not shifting rationales for war. While President Bush's claims about weapons of mass destruction and links between Iraq and Al Qaeda may have revived memories of the Gulf of Tonkin for some of our parents, my generation wasn't inclined toward incredulousness. After all, according to that same poll, 50 percent of those surveyed under 30 said they trusted government to do the right thing; for Americans older than us, that number was 36 percent.     Thus did the lack of skepticism about power (owing to inattention or lack of experience) translate into support for the war. But it turns out that the war has displayed features of all government programs, and taught close observers a thing or two about the unintended consequences of government action, the ever escalating costs of government programs, the inability of government to control events, the inflated egos and lies of public officials, the tendency of the press to play along, and the inevitable result of government programs that they produce the very opposite of their stated purposes. No seasoned observer of government can be surprised that the war on terror produced more terror and threats of terror, any more than we should be surprised to see the wars on tobacco, poverty, drinking, fat, speeding, illiteracy, and all the rest, fail just as badly. In short, this war has provided an essential civics lesson that the state is not a friend of truth and liberty but rather its enemy. And so support for the war among students has dropped from 65 percent to 49 percent. But will the lesson penetrate beyond the superficial level of who should be supported for president? Will the current generation of students see through the partisan fog and observe the core ideological battle of our age and every age? This is the crucial question, and so long as people talk about left and right, liberal and conservative, we are likely to miss it. Foer closes his NYT's op-ed with a thoroughly conventional prediction that the new generation will be liberal on social issues and conservative on national security (he might have added economics to reinforce this repetition of rhetorical conventions). Based on correspondence and applications to Mises Institute programs, it seems to me that we are observing a turn towards a politics that evades the media's radar: libertarianism, which combines free-market politics, opposition to the warfare state, and a peaceful world outlook. This view borrows from the right’s critique of the state at home, and from the left's critique of the state abroad, to forge a political perspective that is as realistic as it is radical. To discover it counts as the great moment in the life of any intellectual because it opens vast vistas for creative thinking on economics, history, philosophy, law, sociology, and even literature. This summer our humble campus at the Mises Institute is filled with students working in all these fields and coming from many different ideological backgrounds but drawn to something more substantive than the political harangues available at the bestseller rack. This is also a generation that has benefited beyond measure from the products of free enterprise and global trade; they are surrounded by the blessings of the "anarchy of production" and witness to the destructionism of government planning. To believe in liberty, and understand its application in all affairs in life, is to cease to be buffeted by the winds of partisan politics, and instead to do your part in the preservation and further development of civilization itself. If students are drawn to ideals in our time, the libertarian ideal is poised for a renaissance. As always, your assistance in helping make this happen is greatly appreciated.

       Well, at least, no chew toy.  My Siberian Husky, Emma, comes across as the easy going dog with no particular place to go.  Then, when she realizes that with the right position that she can slip out of her leash, she has the speed of a thoroughbred.  I have been trying a new harness because her collar was matting down her hair.  Apparently, it was a little too loose.  After wandering the neighbor and making sure that she did not wander over to the elementary school playground (recess in session, of course), I found her in the farmer's field next to where I live.  Grazing on grass, she seems to have gotten in touch with her inner vegan.

       I like American History.&nbsp; Mainly, I like finding the cause and effect.&nbsp; I look not for the Civil War, but all the events that led up to it.&nbsp; Slavery became the moral rallying cry only in the midst of the War.&nbsp; Slavery was a portion of the war, but not on moral grounds.&nbsp; The South started to hint at succession long before because the Congress kept pushing through laws that benefited the industry of the North.&nbsp; With its large population&nbsp;north of the Mason-Dixon line, the South's agricultural (and low population, so therefore low representation in the House) was continually pushed into a corner.&nbsp; Secession was the last straw because the pendulum had swung far enough.     I have read Sarah's  urlLink posts  recently and see that pendulum is getting to a point that something seems to want to change, but so many people have become numb to trying&nbsp;that apathy or frustration becomes the word.&nbsp; Relationships have taken a push to "entitled" from "nurtured".&nbsp; Every next generation recently has been given the example that they can&nbsp;take the role of Love a little less seriously.&nbsp; ("Don't worry about it?&nbsp; You got a pre-nup right?")&nbsp; The idea of respect and maturing a relationship seems to become more novel and time consuming as oppose to "How many dates till sex?&nbsp; Geesh.. really? Three!"&nbsp;&nbsp;Divorce has become the&nbsp;escape hatch&nbsp;and respect for your vows&nbsp;are just words.&nbsp; Why do parents who stay together after "all those years" still seen as an enviable goal?&nbsp; People want love, but many see the time to have a strong foundation as way too long.&nbsp; Each generation seems to have&nbsp;found a way to loosen the standard or&nbsp;justify the&nbsp;reason.&nbsp; As&nbsp;a point of view, I offer the&nbsp;last fifty years in quick snapshots as seen by me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1950's, leather jackets and Rock music arrived on the American stage.&nbsp; Parents are shocked, kids are love that.&nbsp; The pendulum moves.&nbsp; The 1960's, the dam bursts loose and free love and drugs were the theme that seems to resonate from the period. The kids are now the parents and the now grandparents have less of a role and seem forgotten.&nbsp; The pendulum moves further.&nbsp; What can the next generation do to top the previous?&nbsp; The 1970's has polyester and peace.&nbsp; Parents and kids seem to want to be on the same page.&nbsp; Pendulum keeps going.&nbsp; The 1980's comes across as&nbsp;Mike Douglas in " urlLink Wall Street " with the quote "Greed is good".&nbsp; I remember the 90's as a whole lot of anger and frustration with the family becoming more of a memory than a foundation.&nbsp; Pearl Jam and Nirvana being the music that focused on the feelings of those years for the new generation.&nbsp; The 21st century?&nbsp; Good question.&nbsp; I see the US as the new Rome living in a gilded cage across the Atlantic.&nbsp; We spend money that we do not have, the sun never sets on the US military and our government leaders seems to say things that are always taken out of context.&nbsp; (I think Cheney meant every word to Sen. Leahy.&nbsp; Though, should our leaders have more respect for differing opinions? Yes.)   Are we still a superpower?&nbsp; As long as our credit is good.&nbsp; Another ramble at another time.  &nbsp;

       A note from my brother in law... I like it!   Jim Mueller - Proof that libertarianism in government works   Jim Mueller is town administrator and clerk in Middleton, Wisconsin. He's been on the job for five years and has cut the town's administrative costs down to about two-thirds of the state average per capita cost. Middleton's population has grown 30 percent since 1999, from 4,000 to about 5,200, but services have improved -- while taxes have not increased.  Jim Mueller is a Libertarian.  A former chairman of the Wisconsin Libertarian Party, Mueller was elected to the Middleton town board in 1997, then was appointed town administrator in late '99.  "Since he's been there he has cut government waste and the town's budget [for administration] has gone way down, to 65 percent of the average for the state," said Jeremy Keil, an alternate representative to the Libertarian National Committee who is on the Wisconsin LP's executive committee.  "The Middleton budget used to be much higher per capita than it is now," Keil said. "It shows what having a Libertarian in office can do."  Mueller, 52, is also now deputy treasurer for the town; the treasurer recently died and he was tapped to fill the slot on a temporary basis.  While residents of larger cities wouldn't consider surpassing the 5,000-resident mark a sign of massive growth, Mueller said he spends much time "fighting the 'sprawl costs us all' mentality that some people spread around."  Some people claim that growth in the town will by necessity force taxes to increase to provide services, he said.  So he took it as a challenge to prove them wrong.  When Mueller was appointed administrator, some local officials were obviously not in the frame of mind to "look at where they were wasting money," he said.  Some even pointed out that "this is government; this isn't business," he added.  "Too much in government, they don't look to see where they can cut costs. They don't even look at the common sense things you'd look for in your own budget. I had quite a battle, at the start. They said, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it.' And my attitude was that pretty much everything is broken."  The town board chairman even resigned in 2002, saying he didn't like the way Mueller was running the town. He apparently hoped the other officials would fire Mueller. But they decided to let the chairman go and keep their administrator -- a tribute to his effectiveness.  Middleton now provides more services than ever before -- and the tax rate in the town hasn't gone up during Mueller's administration.  "We have a volunteer fire department. We have a volunteer recreation department so we're not having to tax people a lot to take care of other people's children. We've contracted with a private company to do garbage pickup. Our population has increased, but we're keeping costs down.  "It can be done."  And it was through meeting Mueller that Ed Thompson -- who ran for governor of Wisconsin in 2002, winning 10.4 percent of the vote and becoming the highest-drawing third party gubernatorial candidate in the state in 60 years -- joined the Libertarian Party.  "We need more like him," Thompson said of Mueller, noting that while a lot of people talk about eliminating waste and keeping taxes down, it took a Libertarian in office in this small Wisconsin town to pull it off.
