       We discussed dystopian visions (and utopian ones, but less so) in CS201 today and it reminded me of something I've been struck by. (This in no way implies that others haven't been struck by this or that it is original. But it's new to me. :) ) I have an impression that the fantasies of science fiction often predict technologies that are actually developed, and I don't think this is because the Nostradamus-like qualities of the authors.  One, does such a link actually exist?   * the "Good Old Fashioned" AI program -- focusing on making computers that can completely interact with humans but be more perfect information processors -- seems to have preceeded by sci-fi fantasies like Metropolis (or really, just the very natural-seeming idea that we'd want perfect slaves)   * cyberspace (but I haven't actually read Neuromancer yet, so I might be blowing hot air)  * ?  But why might such a link exist? It doesn't make intuitive sense to me that technologists would read about dystopias and decide to bring it about in a megalomaniacal urge to intervene. More likely it seems that science fiction's predictions would become decontextualized as the ideas travel through literature and social networks, stripping the technologies imagined from the dystopian contexts iin which they were first imagined. Or, perhaps there isn't decontextualization, but just an optimism that 1) it's just a little device or 2) we can always choose whether we want to follow the next step technology makes available to us.  Any thoughts on the nature of interconnections between literature and the technological imagination?

       If you guys have any ideas, I would love to hear any suggestions on my CLASSART 280 project:  So as you may or may not know, I am an electronica DJ at KZSU, and more generally a complete music nut. In putting together setlists, it is always difficult to limit yourself to the 10 or so tracks. For example, say I decide to start a downtempo electronica set with Fila Brazillia's "A Zed and Two L's." In thinking of what to transition to, I immediately can think of 20+ songs that I would love to play. Each transition would convey a slightly different experience, and lead the set in a unique direction.   And yet, ultimately you can only choose one next song. You are forced to ignore the other possibilities. Speaking from experience, that linearity is pretty goddamn frustrating.   So my idea is this: why not use a MUD/Adventure game interface (think Adventure, Zork, etc) and let a "listener" walk around a virtual world. Each area or "room" would have a song associated with it, playing in the background. That way, you could walk around and traverse the DJ set yourself - in non linear fashion. For example, maybe you start off in a house. If you go outside into the street, maybe the set becomes a jazz mix. But maybe if you walk upstairs instead, the mix turns into spooky ambient electronica.   As you can see, the other effect of the virtual world is that you could associate the descriptions with the music. Music is, in my experience, the most "nostalgic" art, in that pieces of music have such strong ties to totally random pieces of our memory. A song could remind you of a person, a color, a place, a time, a mood, etc. So the idea would be to play off that with the textual descriptions.   Some friends and I have maintained a group music blog off and on, and I think we've all shared the experience where, in analyzing or talking about a song, it can be very difficult to directly describe a song. At least in my experience, sometimes it's a lot easier to conjure up environments or moods that the song brings to mind. For instance, "this song really reminds me of a dark, bumpy train ride." So that's the idea of the "Music Text Adventure" I'm envisioning. Musical analysis through abstract experientiality in a virtual world.   In brainstorming the program, I can think of two major problems. First, it seems as if there would be a temptation to walk (or otherwise abstractly progress) through the world very fast, to the point where you would only be hearing 30 seconds of each song. If the user has control over the movement, how can you get them to listen to the full song? Obviously, you can have entire groups of areas and/or rooms share the same background song, but I still don't think that would entirely solve the problem. Second, you wouldn't want the whole experience to feel too texty, because it's hard to read long, elaborate text and listen closely to music at the same time.   The solution I'm thinking about right now is to keep each room/area description short, and make the text more interactive. For example, allow a "look at" command, and give objects in each room their own descriptions for the user to access themselves. Also, you could code in timed events that pop up as the user stands in a room. For example, suppose you were on a street corner. Every few seconds you could load up a random message "A car speeds by" or "A dark figure walks into the apartment across the street." It seems like such events would add to the immersive "experientiality" of the whole thing.   Ideally, it seems like this could even be a fun group tool. Perhaps you could provide a web interface for people to add their own rooms, descriptions, events, and mp3s. That way, you could explore music linkages in a more social, communicative way. I could even see this becoming a simultaneous MUD situation, where people congregate in different rooms and discuss (or even roleplay?!) about the music.   I actually wrote the program already in Java, and it works on my PC. But there is a huge issue about finding open source Java classes that play mp3s, since its a proprietary format. When I get it cross platform, I am going to Java webstart the program in my webspace.    Well, sorry that was so long. I figured it would be fun to share, since most of my other friends look at me like I'm insane when I tell them about this.   Feel free to trash the idea, or suggest alterations/augmentations.   - Doug

       So I had a frustrating experience with a friend this week. This builds off my last post. Nothing too deep, just some thoughts I have been struggling with:  On AOL Instant Messenger, I tend to leave pretty zany away messages. As I see it, having a profile and an away message up most of every day is a convenient, powerful way to communicate with friends. I know a lot of people leave messages like "At class" or "I'm not at the computer right now" but I've always felt compelled to take advantage of that very visible digital real estate (I know all my friends are checking my away messages).   Anyway, so Tuesday night I had a very elaborate and long analysis of a bootlegged Mogwai song that I had just downloaded. The song had really blown me away on Monday night, and that experience was the most immediate thing I wanted to communicate to my friends that day. But a friend later criticized the message as "overblown" and stated that all away messages should be less than two lines.   So here is the question: clearly, most people treat AIM as a basic communication medium, but that's about it. Is it foolish to hope that people would engage the medium more creatively? If we're all checking away messagess anyway, it just seems like a waste to not take advantage of that little text bubble to say something enaging. Or, as my friend might argue, is it cheesy to try to convey any colorful, more personal information passively in an away message? I think he would argue that anything interesting worth saying should be said directly to a person in a one-on-one conversation.  Just some thoughts...

       I just watched a lecture that just happened at Columbia's Digital Media Center given by electronic art hacktivist Ricardo Dominguez. I think it's actually pretty brilliant and thought you might want to see it. You can view the Real stream at  urlLink DMC lecture series . The other lectures also look pretty cool...I've met Mary Flanagan before, and she also does awesome stuff...  =)  Casey

       Yeah, I like the idea of a collective blog more than an individual one. The media guru Scott Bukatman once deftly captured the masturbatory quality of individual blogs with his retooled zen koan: "What is the sound of one man blogging?"   I also think that collaborative, real-time authoring will also have a huge impact on the history of knowledge production/publishing. Already the sciences are abandoning the monopolistic politics and economics of independent publishers and taking control of their own publishing via the  urlLink Public Library of Science . The scientists finally realized that they do all the refereeing and peer-reviewing anyway, so why should they pay thousands of dollars a year to subscribe to the journals for which they themselves provide the sole legitimacy? As much as I'm a complete design junkie, why should the publishers make fat income and  control the rights to the article  just because they package it nicely?   Regarding the name, though I love the allusion to FutureFarmers (and might even be able to get some of them to join the blog if you want), I think we should tweak the name a bit...Not that I have any better ideas...  I also have some cool new ideas that I'm thinking of developing and might post for you all to give feedback on...  =) Casey

       Doug makes a useful point that there is a model of blogging very attached to the idea of personal identity and more democratic access to the power of the getting the message out. This is the model that leads to blogs as either serious publishing outlets for op-ed sorts of pieces or for journals at a distance that convey a sometimes mistaken sense of anonymity. But it seems to me that when you look at the print publishing world, you see newspapers like The Nation, The New York Times, or 'zines -- and these are almost always the product of a group of people working around a common theme.   I'd argue that group blogging is the way of the future.  You might argue that the group nature of traditional print media is a function of its economics. Distribution has marginal cost greater than zero. However, publishing in groups also provides validation of what you do publish, since more than a lone ranter is standing behind it.   There is also something different about who has been blogging and who will join (if they do). Later adopters different kinds of people than the technology early adopter "visionary" types who pride themselves on their expertise and forward-lookingness. most people don't feel like they have something so uniquely important to say that people will care enough to read about them and just about them. This is vaguely based on the same reasoning put forth by Geoff Moore in "Crossing the Chasm," but for a business book it actually makes sense. ;)  There are enough people who do that blogging in its current "personal publishing" form that it has become a fairly widespread phenomenon, but I think community organizing -- and the support and validation it provides -- is far more likely than soapboxing or publishing your personal diary.

       In response to this "cyberspace equivalent of uncomfortable silence":  This is something that has also been bugging me a lot over the last year. And it's why I got rid of my personal blog (at least in the traditional written format) and why my group music blog has sputtered out.   First, hardly anyone (in my experience) ever posts to their personal blog with regularity, or at least with a regularity of meaningful depth. This always bugged me about other people's blogs, but especially about my own personal blogging. You get all these random looks into a person's life, but posts are usually only written when someone is euphoric or depressed, or when someone is extremely bored. As someone who is very concerned about expressing himself fully, it seems gnawing that your digital representation would be so fractured and incomplete. And all this because very few of us take the time to maintain an adequately representative blog.   Is it reasonable to demand that we all take the medium more seriously? I don't know. I often tried to force myself, but as Stanford students (and more generally, people of the modern world) we're all so busy. But it seems problematic that the medium of blogging - at least personal blogging - is treated and viewed as a mere diversion, or a method of procrastination.  As for the lack of comments in blogs, I think it's because people like to remain anonymous when they read blogs (maybe that's painfully obvious). It's weird - I know we read the blogs of people we hardly even know or even people we have fallen out of touch with. Even when those blogs are deeply personal. And nobody admits it. It's this weird spying method of personal contact. People won't comment about serious issues not only because people don't view blogs seriously, but more because people don't want to admit that they read other blogs seriously and compeltely. It seems like few people feel like blogs are a respectable medium for serious discussion.   Obviously, more academically of topic oriented blogs suffer less from these problems because there isn't that "personal journal" stigma attached. However, I think we all know even non-personal blogs fail more often than they succeed.   As Lilly suggested, I think a good solution is a group blog (at least until people start engaging with blogging more seriously... if that ever happens). First, people can fill in the gaps when others are too busy to post. Second, if everyone is dedicated to commenting and actively interacting, other people's posts are a fertile source of ideas/news to write about.   I think the key is to get the ball rolling. Thus, the purpose of this overly long post. Wow, how weirdly self-referential is this post.

       In trying to name this blog, Doug and I amused ourselves at our play on the art collective  urlLink Future Farmers . When we're better slept, it'll probably be less funny and we'll change it to something else.  I pitched this to Doug as  i'm thinking virtuality, new media, interface design, embodiment, video games, film genres, technical developments relevant to...whatever   Why here? Because whenever I post this stuff to my  urlLink Livejournal , I feel the cyberspace equivalent of uncomfortable silence. ;)  This will be a place for us and whoever else to discuss ideas about the future identity, thought, and expression.

       urlLink There, Inc. Delivers a Brave New Online World to Consumers :  - "Women rule: Women continue to be an underserved audience for online games despite women outnumbering men on the Web and spending more money online than men. There appeals to women; during Beta they returned more often than men and were more often leaders of the community." [I wonder if there was a selection effect for the kinds of women they recruited to be beta testers. For example, they recruited me because they found me as the leader of the Women in CS group at Stanford. Otherwise, this bullet is obviously trying to imply that women gravitate towards community based approaches to engaging technology. Reminds me a little of Brenda Laurel type ideas, though I don't really know her ideas well enough to really say that.]

       Gender associations and social software   I recently saw a comment on myths about blogging, one of which said something to the effect of: "Blogging is only done by teenage girls"  At first I thought to myself "what makes that myth negative?" then realizing that teenage girls are a symbol for insipidity in our culture. Then I counterargued with myself, noting that I'm just as disparaging, if not moreso, about teenage boys and their video games. So maybe it's not so much something about one gender's adolescence being maligned over another's, but I think there is something to the fact that the technologies that embodies these stereotypically maligned behaviors might *not* be evenly disparaged.   There's a lot more fervor behind the development of video games and the component technologies and algorithms that propel their progress than there seems to be around blogging and communication software. Maybe there's just not as many obvious places to take "social software" -- but somehow, I find it hard to believe.  I realize there are bunch of counters to this musing because it is just that -- observationally informed musing. But it is rooted in something.

      Object oriented programming vs imperative programming Relational vs mechanical command oriented Really gender polarized? "Relational" fits certain stereotypes of females being nurturing, relation-oriented. That's not necessarily a bad thing.   What I want to know is whether there is a observable difference between women's (and men's) responses to/performance on tasks centered around relational paradigms vs mechanical ones (whatever that means).  This isn't very fleshed out because I'm sitting in a seminar right now, jotting this down before I forget.

      Kanter's theories about tokenization in the workplace are primarily directed at explaining how women are  viewed  as the gender ratio varies. What are findings that examine who women may  present themselves  differently as their composition of the social group changes? The thing that made me think of this is that it's not only true that women as a distinct group are most visible around that 15% marker (according to kanter, anyways...psychology of contrast), but it's also true that my self-awareness as a woman (cuing of gender) varies with the composition of my companions. The kind of relationship surely alters the cocktail as well -- work relations vs friendships, for example.  So...hmm...how to more concrete. Does the blackness of a black dot in a field of red dots come to attention more than the blackness of a black dot in a field composed of 30% black dots and 70% red dots? I would guess yes. What if instead of 70% red dots the 70% dots of a random distribution of like...(m/10)+ colors (where m=# of dots)? In that case, I would wonder if the black dots might have a sense of groupness as the largest minority, despite the minority status. That seems more obvious now that I've fleshed it out in those terms.   To reframe the first scenario a bit, does the blackness of a black dot come to attention more when 99% of the dots are black? Certainly the black probably gets framed as "normal" as opposed to aberrant, but still, gender is cued. So in the real world, how does the cueing of gender vary as the gender ratio swings from one extreme to the other (male saturated to female saturated). I wonder if there would be interesting similarities since the same notions of gender get cued by the extreme nature of both situations.   Sorta related to the vaccuum thread, but only tangentially, it does seem the demographics should influence design and creativity not necessarily because of socially encourages knowledges and concerns (though certainly possible, harder to predict?) but also through just cueing a different range of concepts.   Maybe the thing to creativity isn't so much gender equity as just variance along all dimensions. In fact, that's a lot more  it , I think. And once "pale and male" is no longer the norm, then will pale and male become the aberration that may generate our "unconventional creativity"?  Blah. Confusing self. But I feel like this is an interesting quagmire to me.   Bob Sutton's book "Weird Ideas That Work" is a biz press sort of book that actually seems pretty grounded in research as these things go, and that research probably  should  drill into these issues if it doesn't already.

      I appreciate the attention to this topic. The fundamental question of whether demographics affect design interests me a great deal. But the artlcle and argument is also pretty simplistic and gives me the heebie jeebies.    urlLink STUFF : INFOTECH - STORY  : New Zealand's leading news and information website : "'There's a lack of understanding from men in what women do. For example, the robot vacuum cleaner is round, and all women will know that won't get the dust out of corners.' " [me - Anyone who has vacuumed should realize that, I suppose. I don't think the square edges get stuff out of corners either, actually.]  "Many think the industry is full of computer geeks writing viruses and causing havoc. But unlike other industries, where you have to comply with an image, in technology you'll be able to find your niche." [me - I think it's totally wrong that sociology findings go out the window in tech culture. I don't think it does a service to anyone to lie. If you're resorting to that, then you should take a second look and figure out what the compelling reasons to get involved actually are.]

He disposes of this theory for the lack of women's prominence in early recordings, commenting that if that were true, then how would they have made picolo recordings?

      I went to a talk at the Stanford Humanities Center tonight by  urlLink Anne Fausto-Sterling  called "The Bare Bones of Sex."   If I have her right (and I did nod off for about 10 minutes :-/ because I'd been at school for 10 hours at that point), she advocates for a move away from the standard paradigm of nature/nurture - sex/gender, at least in biology, where sex is bleeding out to encompass all manner of difference. By this, I think she means to take on sociobiologists who use a static notion of sex as a program that is set at birth and plays out in the world. Instead, she calls for an understanding of biological questions (she uses osteoporosis as her main example) through an analysis of a system of interconnected subsystems that feedback into each other through someone's life. Sex, gender, and culture are the context in which this system operates, along with race, class, and many other factors. But the systems-approach, as a model, frames questions in terms of understanding of how many variables interact to affect the resulting phenomenon. This is in opposition to the traditional multi-variate analysis methods that lead to a proliferation of "knowledge" about risk factors (basically correlations) but don't get to the core of how the system works.  She said that medical feminism now is where academic feminism was 30 years ago. By this, I took her to mean that academic feminism is coming around to acknowledging that gender is only one of many cultural identities taken on by an individual and it may not even be the most important one. Furthermore, the importance of identities vary over time. But medical feminism still very much looks for sex differences in pathologies without accounting for the complexity of factors that might instead explain the sex difference found in the population studied.  As an example, she described some difference between white men and women in incidences of bone fractures. These differences, however, did not exist between african-american men and women, suggesting that other systematic factors may have been at work.   In long, I thought her talk was interesting. Her take on understanding systems is actually very natural to me, partially coming out of an engineering background and partially in my leanings towards qualitative research to explicate systems and quantitative research to give a reality check and testing ground for resultant models. I should read more.

      I found this article and thought it was really interesting:  http://www.twincities.com/mld/pioneerpress/7507887.htm  It discuses women leaving their corporate careers in their 40s or so. It touches on diversity in the workforce, corporate politics, and entrepreneurship.   The women discussed in the article are in their 40s and 50s, but I know that female engineer friends of mine approaching graduation seem to have these sorts of stories as well. One friend is leaving biomechanical engineering after graduation (at least for a while) to pursue her passion for education. Another wants to pursue economic development -- whether it puts her CS major to work or not. But I know men who go through this too, though they are also less than a handful. I wonder if there are studies that actually have looked at this in a systematic manner.   This article is all gender, little technology. :)

      I'm exploring the story of the discovery of DNA. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins received the Nobel prize for it, though Rosalind Franklin ( urlLink a bio ) was also responsible for its discovery. She had died of ovarian cancer a few years before the prize was awarded and the prize is not awarded post-humously.   Apparently there is some controversy about the terms in which the story of DNA's discovery has been told. One account is "The Double Helix," responded to by Anne Sayre ( urlLink Rosalind Franklin and DNA  -- admittedly an unoriginal title) that describes the sex discrimination Franklin faced in her lifetime.   Interesting story. I want to learn more about it. I first started exploring it because I was interested in the role of experimentalists as agents of scientific change in the history and philosophy of science.

      I should have found this and included it in my thesis.  "Researchers working in this area have argued that much of the early work concerned with human-computer interaction failed to develop a critical assessment of the technology that would lead researchers to study the ways that social context, power relations and social bias may affect the actual systems that are created.  To counter these difficulties, Suchman and Jordan [16] stress the importance of demystifying technology and legitimating women's knowledge in the system development process. They argue that this will require a dramatic shift in how we view the knowledge and skills that go into system development. Such a shift must incorporate a sophisticated understanding of the social world into the system development process."  [[failed to develop a critical assessment of the technology that would lead researchers to study the ways that social context, power relations and social bias may affect the actual systems that are created]] - this is exactly the question I'm interested in!

      Found this book on Stanford's Lane Reading Room Digital Humanities Shelf: LB1028.43 B64 2000 David Bolt and Ray Crawford, "Digital Divide"  It has a chapter titled "The Gender Gap." It discusses the case of Fulmore Middle School in Austin, which has grants from Bill Gates to pursue a number of technology and education initiatives.   Specifically, it raises the question of how girls and boys tend to approach computers in the classroom, touching on scarcity of technological resources and girls' withdrawal and subsequently reduced access to computers.   The chapter also touches on increasing efforts (though still too few in number) to create technological domains (games, sites like chickclick.com, after school tech programs) that are empowering, safe spaces for girls to learn. Part of this effort is the "girl" software market. The chapter profiles Nancie S. Martin (Director at Mattel Media-Software for Girls, a division of Mattel Toy Company). Her division has put out "Barbie Fashion Designer" which sold more than 500k copies in its first two months on the market. The success was also met with criticisms (that I myself would and have lodged) that the software supports existing stereotypes and implicitly labels other, more challenging software products as "for boys." Mattell also bought Brenda Laurel's Purple Moon software in 1999. A company called Girl Games (Austin, TX; president Laura Groppe) has created titles such as "Let's Talk About Me."  I don't have time to do analysis on this right now. All in all, I didn't really learn anything new from the chapter but at least it gave me a whole bunch of names of people for my "Barbie Project" (as discussed with Fred Turner, doing a research project on the design process and how gender stereotypes get encoded in software; it actually seems fairly obvious phrased that way, but I bet there would be some interesting fodder to chew on once I got deep into the research process).

      Warren Sack was totally awesome tonight and got into new media and science studies as a comp sci undergrad because he got interested in feminist theory. So uncommon! So like me! Hopefully I'll get to finish an actual conversation with him at some point. When I get time, I want to finish his  urlLink article on the story of AI and aesthetics . But tonight, must work on things that people will actually ask me about soon.

      Anne Balsamo - Onomy Labs - X-periments in the Future of Reading ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Used to be part of Xerox Parc's Research in documents    XFR Charter   New Media Genres - "Genres are ways in which information design gets codified over time and over distance"; consists of authoring tools, design lang, material forms, social arrangements   genre  - a set of conventions for meaning construction   New Document Forms - emerging tech; xerox's core technology, information design of new media (conventions and requirements of new media technologies, paper conventions (i.e. PDF) not suitable for general web consumption (there is a nielsen alertbox about this)); archiving/exchange/documentation/encoding  Innovative Research Methods - designing experiments, not products; speculative design (markets don't necessarily exist, products we don't yet need or imagine that we want); worked in studio culture; high-visibility, high-risk project    Museum as Genres   XFR gets ready to hit the tech museum!  What is cultural meaning of museums?  - turn of century: collections of artifacts  - 1960s science centers: Hands-on demonstrations  - 1980s: focus on participatory interactive exhibits; exploratorium  The intended recipient: example of applied genre research/design  -  visitor  - term of museum intended recipient; different from user (expectation of repeated use), audience (expectation of non-participation)  - visitor expectations  - preferred mode of engagement: having it be really simple for someone to learn things; "big brass knob" tradition of science museum exhibits: that there is basically one variable you can tweak in a predigested experience. different from, say, art event where what you get out of it is largely dependent on what you put into it  - attention span: success failure means ppl get really into exhibit, big line forms, everyone goes away, and stuff doesn't get seen; if person can't get into experiment very quickly, they can very easily just walk away  - accessibility: colorblind, able-bodied, small children, other languages, ppl in wheelchairs  Part of the exhibit was a Book Artist's Studio where a book artist was working all the time. Aimed to ground future of reading in the practice of document production today. Who are the people behind documents?    What do the experiments look like?   Honor tradition of paper based books. Don't completely abandon them. At the time, people were all up-in-arms about PDAs. But Scott points out that even if these technologies are successful, they don't completely replace the old. So don't get caught up in ooh the pda.    Where will tech take the narrative?

        some design principles of computer science learning experience design    Fill these in with cases of how this has happened in different sorts of contexts, paying attention to any possibly subte particulars about the context that made the described practice successful in supporting the design principle.   * Students should be able to frequently and accurately assess their performance in relation to the class.   - therefore giving hour estimates for how long a program takes isn't successful as it doesn't account for the perceptual flexibility of time; what are you going to do -- journal your hours?   - What are strategies for mediating attribution differences in men and women?  * Students should be able to validly assess their performance in relation to their peers.   * Students should feel safe participating in course activities, both emotionally and physically. (i.e. a lab can be a great place, but maybe not for a campus where you need to walk and there are muggings right and left)  * Curricula should support varied styles of learning.     - i.e. Listeners, readers, talkers  * Curricula should support varied styles of conceptualizing and solving problems. (This does not imply "writing sloppy code is okay." Solutions will be subject to the same standards and models to the same tests of robustness.)   more more more! we need more! these are but paltry examples

      Concrete sigcse women in CS things that I will follow up on:   - Univ of Colorado group working on women in CS questions  - SIGCSE committee on expanding the community of women in computer science  - These teachers really need tools for cultural and classroom evaluation, probably more than all but the most general directives -- design principles coupled with tools to understand if their current classrooms meet those needs  My talk @ SIGCSE:   - cohesive thought that came out of it for me was that the problem is really this disconnect in gendered communication styles and pedagogical choices should abide by the design principle that a course should afford opportunities for students to see how their peers *really* work, rather than giving an open space for them to talk about it  - I really should talk about the whole study at some point, since 106A really frames it, maybe submit other chunks of paper (the fem stud journal submission) to   - learn to talk slower :P  Product designing computer science with the goal of making it equitable, inclusive, and vibrant:  - how do you cause a frame shift?  - broken windows principles, tipping point strategies for who to get in the boat, etc  - just because a workaround is there doesn't mean that there isn't a problem  Panel on ethics @ SIGCSE: from conversation with Flo Appel - feminist ethics, social ethics, intellectual property ethics ethics course speaker teaches uses 5 online discussions, 2 face to face discussions, grading basis?   - sometimes outside experts help (getting them in a dialogue with students rather than lecture format would be really cool)   - each page has off-site links to related articles, a study guide, discussion ?s, "breaking news" (google news alerts?)   - submission to peer review "independent study topics" - how does eric's presentation day do this? students present to TAs or to classmates also? making ethical interrogations is a useful skill (as is giving UI critique)

      Cosmetic surgery and the fight against entropy  Disorganization, asymmetry, degradation, Wiener's death fought against in increasinly iterative plastic surgery rituals -- botox parties  in some ways, contradictory since these physical augmentations actually desensitize (nipples, lips, etc) but at the same time succumb to or celebrate the pressures of embodiment. by exerting control over our bodies, we influence our lived experience and even our minds as people frequently describe that they feel more confident after plastic surgery.   ---------------------------------------  Kate Hayles on page 108 uses the metaphors of celibacy and eroticism to describe intellectual discovery. This was a theme I was interested in exploring with regards to the masculinity of science as well, though it's definitely seeming to be one of those fuzzy metaphorical thoughts where I'm not sure what the practical real world implications are.

      I'm flipping through a 1962 volume titled "The Sociology of Science" that I got at a used bookstore a few months ago. (I was trying to recruit used booksellers for my design project and felt compelled to browse, buy, and get a feel for the place before springing my request on them -- an expensive effort to get 3 sellers.)  An article by Margaret Mead caught my eye since she's famous for studying Samoans, not scientists, and I was amused by this quote. Mead explains that the image of scientists is overwhelmingly negative "when the question becomes one of personal contact with science, as a career choice or involving a choice of a husband."  The odds are good but the goods are odd haha chuckle chuckle they say to those of us in male dominated majors. Mostly, it's novel to see Mead, often described as a feminist anthropologist, communicate the assumption that the scientist will be male.   Almost everywhere in the 60s-70s science studies literature I've been looking at, you see the actors referred to as "he" and I won't jump to the conclusion that it's sexist (though someone wanting to have a more radical discussion might) as there are many who use he as shorthand for he/she, not liking the awkward construction. Maybe I should also assume husband is shorthand for husband/wife? No, not when spouse would is shorter than husband. :)   (cross posted to my livejournal)

      From Balsamo,  Technologies of the Gendered Body : - "a political judgement of any technology is difficult to render in the bastract. Technologies always have multiple effects" (146). - "corporeal feminism" is described by Elizabeth Grosz as "an understanding of corporeality that is compatible wtih feminist struggles to undermine patriarchal structures and to form self-defined terms and representations" (157). not a bad starting definition of what feminist metaphors of hci should strive for. Grosz refigures "the body so that it moves from the periphery to teh center of analysis, so that it can now be understood as the very 'stuff' of subjectivity" (157).

      I propose the framework of Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory  as a way of conceptualizing gender – feminism’s central locus of concern – as neither a function of biology nor a total social construction, but instead as a co-construction of social actors and sexual characteristics. Avoiding essentializing biological definitions of woman, however, I instead argue that the metaphors our culture lives by, entailed by women’s reproductive capacities make it impossible to a bipolar gender system.

      Castells describes research in HCI that uses EEGs to adapt interfaces to the mental states of the user -- the organic recombinant in our cyborg fantasy.(73) This very literal interpretations of Haraway's cyborg manifest in directing HCI research entails the same genderedness.    However, there is power in Haraway's metaphor to emphasize multiple, situated identities  making up our individual wholes. The computing technology   of MUDs serves as one example of an environment in which Haraway's cyborg can make temporary retreats from the embodied actors in the gender network, experimenting and elucidating the many layers and textures of personality that can, in different situations, become natural to them.

      Turkle, "Life on Screen"  MUDing as a space to explore alternate gender identities, "form of consciounsess raising" (214) "MUDs  and the virtual personae one adopts within them are objects-to-think-with for reflecting on the social construction of gender" (213). obj-to-think-with becomes sort of like a cyborg composition, and yet, in the current culture of virtual reality, there is always an out and almost always a clear recognition of which part of the cyborg composition is "reality." (Fundamentally disabling anonymity on the internet would probably threaten this.) But I don't want to trivialize this cyborg experience. Case, the married 34-year old Turkle interviews, describes experiencing emotional pain in relation to some of his MUDing experiences -- "the kind of learning that comes from hard times" (213). Describes the repression of the willful  But this experimentation is only possible because virtual space is virtual, not "real." As one 13-year old who sexually experiments in internet chat rooms made clear to Sherry Turkle, "she feels safe because she can always just 'disconnect'" (227). ( Turkle describes a married 41-year old who was thrilled at the opportunity for sexual experimentation offered by MUDs. "I really am monogamous," he explained. "I'm really not interested in something outside my marriage. But being able to have, you know, a Tiny romance is kind of cool." Another MUDders wife was hurt by her husband's participation in MUD romance, though she explicitly placed MUDs outside the realm of "real life." The irreality of virtual worlds is nothing more than a cultural agreement, subject to slippage over time. Certainly the tension between real life hurt feelings and the trivialization of virtual experiences as unreal point to a crumbling wall at best. But if embodiment is fundamental to sex and sex one element in the actor-network that constructs gender, the meat of the body will never truly become vapor lest we , though such disappearance of the body is a prominent trope in cyberpunk fantasies, rooted in Norbert Wiener's "Human Use of Human Beings." (Synners) [But we don't really have a way of dealing with animal/machine/man hybrids. My imagination cannot conceive of a robot interacting with a human. But what if a robot has a human heart implanted in it? Then I think, if that heart can actually function, it is a human. And that is a genderless being. With stem cell cloning, the continual production of such genderless beings is imaginable. But this is not a victory for feminism. This is simply rendering the issue moot.]  Experience matters - "To pass as a woman for any length of time requires understanding how gender inflects speech, manner, the interpretation of experience" (212).    [Case] picks up [the expression 'aspects of self' eagerly, for MUDding reminds him of how Hindu gods could have different aspects or subpersonalities, all the while having a whole self." -> cyborg a la Chela Sandoval  "There is a chance to discover...gender is constructed" (223).   Possibilities of Feminist HCI:   object-to-think-with almost seems heidegerrian to me, for some reason. But I think it's just a verbal similarity as Heidegger's bent is that we can operate in the world without having a theory of the world. that objects we operate are ready-to-hand and our theories and knowledge about them only come through breakdown. Well, Turkle's tools are a way of stepping outside the reference frame and evoking dissonance and breakdown so we can get beyond our embodied experience. So maybe this is a  genuine feminist possibility in HCI . Only by having a theory of alternatives can you actually consider yourself off exercising choice. ( There go the feminists, ruining people's lives by confusing issues and overwhelming us with choices again. )

      reading squires' thoughts on "fabulous, flexible feminism" as promised by cyberfeminists:  What remains remarkably absent from the cyborg conceptions of Shulamith Firestone, Donna Haraway, and Sadie Plant is an actual research program proposing pieces of work that would reify the theories of liberation they point to.   For Firestone, it's going to the steady march of technology to free women of the burden of reproduction and to deskill and destabilize patriarchs. For Haraway, cyborgs are a metaphor that she calls us to play a role in guiding (quote about women in the valley or something) but she never actually directs us or cautions us with tools we can use in guiding technological production towards her dream. Plant simply sees the white male youth generated cyberpunk culture as liberating to a totalized, essentialized, historically wily woman just as it is. (I think it's cracked up, to be honest.)  As Squires points out,  "the appropriation of the cyborg for the mapping of possible feminist futures has the potential to be a subversive act. But let us not imagine that persuasive rhetoric alone is sufficient to shift the distribution of power" (370).

      My sketched possible thesis, but gonna read a few more articles before committing to starting to write:  Cyberfeminism's hope for the ontological upheavals of in the network enabled future is unlikely to subvert the gender paradigms which, by the power of metaphor, entail many of the inequalities and expectations that shape gendered experiences today.   I. While cyborgs offer to blur the boundaries between man, woman, and animal, a cybernetic organism by definition is integrated with an individual's embodiment.  - donna haraway, cyborg manifesto, potential to delete gender  III. Reproduction of gender system in the ontology of technology  - balsamo: inscriptions of gender in cyberpunk technology,   III. Reproduction as metaphor, femininity as entailments  - Virginia Valian argues, the metphors of reproduction serve as our culture's most powerful signifier of femininity.   - as long as women are the sole holders of biological reproduction and incubation, even distributing the ability through artificial means across genders  IV. Cyberspace as embodiment neutral?  - balsamo: VR embodiment repressed, all you get in canonical embodiment experience when it comes to perspective, cinemantic "eye"  V. Cyberspace as an extension of embodied social practice  - turkle: tinymoos and gender trouble  - while muds don't bind people to adhering to certain gender identity, they still exist in a very real cultural consciousness. if people react against it, they still react against hegemonic cultural beliefs of gender identity and entailment.  VI. Provide a space to experiment with alternate embodiments. But can't get beyong drag-like characterizations of embodiments experimented with.  - laurel: VR as embodiment extension  - drag culture? doesn't extend embodiment in the permanent, difficult to deal with ways. Drag kings don't get morning wood and drag queens don't get monthly periods or the chemical fluctuations that make the hormonal nature of emotion see very believable.  - problems of semiotics was it? when did we and tim discuss the fact that even if you learned a language, having never had the experience of it, you would never be native. linguistics theory.

One answer to the continually shifting ontologies might be varying cyborg configurations and thus, in some, varying agencies and accountabilities we allow to exist outside of our bodies, sort of in reference to the beginning of the Human / Machine paper with that AI researcher woman's work just as one possibility of this.

      Suchman, "Human/Machine Reconsidered"  Man, this references a lot of critical studies of sci/tech. Boy am I glad I took Lenoir's class last quarter!  Karen Barad: "Boundaries are not our enemies, they are necessary for making meanings, but this does not make them innocent...Our goal should not be to find less false boundaries for all spacetime, but reliable, accountable, located temporary boundaries, which we should anticipate will quickly close in against us (p.187)."  This seems like a design principle for feminist HCI if I've ever read one, but it isn't easily understood what kinds of designs and technologies would fit this requirement. Perhaps that can now be the job of my paper. :)  Feminism --> about having the choice to place yourself wherever you want in selecting characteristics that might fit on disparate parts of the typology. As long as their are embodied, rough categories -- to birth or not to birth -- the gender system can extend its categories. It seems that creation of ontology is a fundamental human tendency that allows us to make sense of and survive in the world. But teh key to empowerment is having a passport that allows free travel across these borders? Or is it the power to reconfigure the ontologies altogether?   Yes, in theory. In practice, hard for me to imagine as it is hard for me to imagine existing within another scientific paradigm. So perhaps historical ontologies involving gender might be a useful object of study.  Sleep, fucka.

      Alice Jardine, described in Balsamo "Technologies of the Gendered Body," advocates reconstruction of "our reading practices...written through 'the continual attention -- historical, ideological, and affective -- to the place from which we speak'(32). This...perfectly describes Donna Haraway's response to feminism's 'profound paradox,' and indeed, the founding imperative for her feminist manifesto...that takes the discursively constructed material body as its starting point and narrates a reconstructed fiction of gender identity" (32).   Postmod at its finest. Replace hegemonic fictions with your own as a form of empowerment.   What, then, is a feminist HCI?  knowing from where you speak speaks to my concerns about scenario construction, persona selection. (gender recreated in cyberspace --> orkut sexiness rating histograms by age (female chart and male chart) - I'd expect the peak sexiness age for men to tend towards middle age and for women to tend towards youth. simply informating cultural phenomena in a way that increasingly obscures the cultural meanings of the attributions of sexiness.)  so then would a feminist design  highlight the place from which you speak ? what the hell does that mean anyways? obscuring it seems to be the way of things -- informating obscures the body, obscures the cultural identities, though they still seep through. does this have to do with  subjectivity  (term ppl use that puzzles me a bit...maybe time to tease out what they mean?

       Balsamo, "Forms of Technological Embodiment"   Four forms of postmodern embodiment: 1) laboring body 2) marked body 3) repressed body 4) disappearing body     repressed typically a male-identified transcendental cultural narrative linked with typical VR programs that reduce sensory inputs to narrow channels, eliminate pain. points out that "reconstructed body does not guarantee reconstructed cultural identity" (247). (gendered patterns of communication still follow us in cyberspace, for example) this form     disappearing body - informating of bodies (human genome, info theory opened door for this?). "one that promises...the final erasure of gender and race as culturally organized systems of differentiation" (248). bio-engineered parts replace body parts, challenge and shift notions of natural bodies. Uses  Life  magazine example to point out that discourse around these technologies points to man as a fully embodied being while women are "container for a fetus" (as breast forms obvious exclusion from magazine spread...what about breast implants?)    marked bodies are "where bodies become signs and signs become commodities." points to UI of tools for plastic surgery, where features can be rewritten to match ideal western gendered face with tools such as "erasers, pencils, and 'agenic cursors'" (245)     laboring bodies - asian women making microelectronics because of small nimble fingers. bodies give them a distinct place in system of production.      "masculinist attempts at body repression signal a desire to return to the 'neutrality' of the body, to be rid of the culturally marked body" (251). This makes perfect sense to me as body for white man in post modern seems to have been retold as a source of privilege, source of guilt. Transcending body is a return to "equality" if so simple as that. Anti-affirmitive action arguments also seem to be linked to this. Meritocracy? Informated merit so let us just isolate it to that. (The argument falters before the counterargument that for those benefitting from affirmitive action, embodiment has been one constant factor in cultural identity that can be discriminated against. [Valian argument])

      Body is being erased in postmodern virtuality. Body as nature, organic seat of feminine power and privilege -- child birth. Sex Revolts can back up my assertion of the prevalance of this narrative in at least American culture. Now there is this idea that body is of no consequence -- a more perfect brain (closed world discource). No unified feminist stance on what the implications of this are: - cyborgs can offer us post-gender possibilities  - buy into this disembodiment thing? (plant?) or reembodiment as cyborgs, blurring gender lines (haraway) - technology is inscribed with cultural narratives and situated and computer is another site of this  plan of action:  - get intimate with haraway's argument. try to get gist of what sadie plant's deal is. read balsamo article. read suchman.  then turkle's 2nd self, etc. (balsamo doesn't actually talk about UI. she talks about body. but I think  grade papers, mofo. part animal part machine in 3rd wave agenda reader. read balsamo ch 1, 5, 6

       Beginnings of Notes On Brenda Laurel's "Utopian Entrepreneur"  (but only as it relates to my paper)  Banff VR project - an attempt to turn computers inside out. Rather than creating interfaces that act as channels or conduits of our reduction of input into a system and a thin stream of output in return, recognize the whole body as an interface. Extend your experiential capabilities, not just your information processing capabilities. (She calls for the user of simulations to help us stage the consequences of our actions and make more utilitarian(?) decisions. Funny that this is the very use envisioned for computers in closed world 1950s US while we were on the brink of nuclear war. But Laurel's technolgies are consequences of personal action, not organizational/governmental action. Successor to computer personalization possibility. For her, it really doesn't seem to be about connecting, but about staging.  weird. read up on edwards' metaphors chapter if this becomes important )0  Cultural myths guide our imagination, guide what technologicall artifacts we produce and the fervor with which we defend them. These artifacts, in turn, guide and constrain our actual experiences and thus our imaginations. Earlier, she makes an argument that points to economic structures as what can make a big impact on how technologies are develop and whose rights are preserved by them. So she would argue, I guess, that cultural narratives and values that they display are, in some cases, made manifest in the transactions that take place in these economic structures. Certainly, an economic system such as capital creates and is created by a certain cultural narrative -- the invisible hand, high order right from individual actions performed by informed individuals. (Informed. Yeah. Many consequences are out of our perceptual grasp, as Laurel points out. You never see news stories about how your taxes went into a bridge that didn't collapse. Are there economic systems better suited for our strengths and weaknesses as humans?)  Feminist possibilties of purple moon -- very third wave. Don't judge. Just meet girls where they are, show them that they have options -- choices -- that will impact future situations. Give them a  stage  on which to rehearse and explore those options so they are better prepared to deal with daily life. But I perceive this tension between the online world being rehearsal space and the online world being part of the real space we exist in. In some sense, these computers as theatre are a place for girls to extend childhood's reduced accountability to an extreme of being able to "rewind" the virtual life. I suppose you can do that because you are not dealing with any humans on this stage of experimentation.   Is the virtual world a rehearsal stage for boys as well? Doesn't seem like it is one when I think of the hours spent playing quake and descent. Laurel points out that taking away violence in video games will just beget violence as a means of acting out, venting, showing agency in the form of high school shootings, violence. In some ways, this makes boys the ones in need of demon vents. What do girls need? A place to be bitchy?Is there research on how girls respond to video games traditionally played by boys?How much of their avoidance is access and boy culture and the lack of critical girl gamer mass and how much is it that they don't respond the same way? Maybe the gender inclusive game design book might have something on this.  If my key question is: What is the role of the computer in the feminist imagination? Laurel's answer might be: It is a site of cultural story telling by way of the role it plays in art, the roles ascribed to it in human interactions. It offers extremely broad possibilities, bound in our minds by its myths. So we need to encourage women, men, etc as equal participants in the myth making -- in the tools we design, the problems we try to solve, and the terms under which we partner with it.  What are Laurel's ideal terms for partnership with a machine? Embodied interaction, safe space for "consciousness raising" in pre-"CR" people (read girls without a lifetime of marginalization to raise experiential consciousness about). Increase  understanding  of the world and others' experiences of it, rather than escape. Increase empathy. =============================================================   SEEMS IMPORTANT TO A PAPER ON FEMINISM AND HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION TO DISCUSS WHAT IS NOT A FEMINIST HCI AS WELL, NO?  Edwards chapter 10 - Minds,  Machines, and Subjectivity in the Closed World might be helpful.  Edwards (153): "Here we will find...neither scientists coerced into producing particular theories, nor of theories that merely reflect underlying relations of production. Instead, we will encounter...what Donna Haraway has called "constrained and contested story-telling." Such story-telling 'grows from and enables concrete ways of life."...'theories are accounts  of  and  for  specific kinds of lives." I think I'm interested in replacing theories with imagined needs and expectations reified in form and scientists with "designers." Which sorta brings you to Laurel by way of Haraway and Lakoff. (157) "metaphor is not merely descriptive, but also prescriptive."   What kinds of power relations are written into the desktop metaphor of the Star? From LIza Loop, got impression that intended audience was not managers but secretaries -- the scribes and information encoding machine interface of the day.  This would be somewhat of a historical project of digging through the old documentation and rhetoric surrounding the star, not what has been rewritten of its history over the time. And I don't think I myself could handle just reading the object.   (158) "master tropes provide what amount to basic structures for thought and experience." "politics of culture is, very largely, a politics of metaphor, and an investigation of metaphor must play an integral role in the full understanding of any cultural object. The mind is such an object and the computer is such a metaphor."

      From Nass, Reeves "The Media Equation" ( urlLink Online summary :   Gender stereotyping applies to computer voices: Female voices are perceived as less effective evaluators and more nurturing than are male-voiced systems. Female voiced computers are perceived as better teachers of love and relationships and worse teachers of technical subjects than are male-voiced teaching systems   Can we subvert the gender system while leaving it intact? It seems like as gender and sex become increasingly disconnectable, gender can be more of a choice. (A male can script an interaction that ultimately gets mediated by a female computer voice, and rapper Katastrophe (whose work is described in  urlLink a PopMatters column ) has undergone sex reassignment after living as a man for his post-adolescent life.)  However, this can be a copout. Few people have access to the technology or the invasive medical miracles that makes such slippage possible in its extremes. And say male and female gender become complete social constructions. Then the question becomes whether categorization is even avoidable. Categories and the stereotypes that go with them seem like the heuristics that make the world processable on an immediate, moment-to-moment basis. These stereotypes, in light of the Maturana we've been reading in Winograd's class, are not approximations of rational implications for quick application, but instead just reactionas we have because of the structure-determined nature of our minds. It's not that stereotypes approximate reality, then, that we have them, but because our experiences are like creedlets that have, in a sense, eroded certain structures and patterns of structural reaction (only afterwards, or in the proper conditions, abstracted into a rational justification) that we act in ways that are also explainable as stereotypes. (What changes in the equation when stereotypes become a form of shared cultural knowledge?)  Much to tease out...maybe a 378 paper?? :)

      I've been reading Donna Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto" as closely as I can recently as I'm grappling with the potential of her metpahor for suggesting feminist technology productions, especially with respect to HCI. One question it has prompted that is unanswered right now is how and when technologies actually are used to  strengthen  ontologies of gender by "moppping up" boundary cases. Certainly sex assignment and disambiguation at birth is one example. I suspect you can argue that cosmetic surgery is another, medical textbooks often feature ideal female and male facial forms that are divergent just how you'd expect (jawlines, for example) (Balsamo, "Technologies of the Gendered Body").   I'd also be really interested in a theory explaining when gender "purification" happens rather than gender subversion. I have a feeling it might have something to do with how public the gender display is and how permanent the technological enagement is. For example, a highly permanent intervention like plastic surgery is far less likely to experiment with resistant interventions that cross into the "opposite" gender's space than fairly temporary or undoable experiences like piercing and MUDding.

      Aesthetic Interaction  - Aesthetics is not about prescribing meaning but invoking imagination. Seeking poetic principles for this.  Serendipity and improvisation in interaction. - design for mind/body, design for instrumentality, design for socio-cultural context - concept of user relation  Instrumentality  - art in discourse almost something beyond use

       Emotion, Experience,  and Co-experience   This panel proposes a theoretical  urlLink  framework for experience design . One panelist's web-site also has summaries of other  urlLink theoretical HCI contributions  (their words, not mine).  Their framework posits that three dimensions of experience are: 1) the constant stream of experience that happens when we are conscious 2) narratives describing experience (and change the context and user as a result) 3) co-experience, when experiences are created with others.  They also break down user interactions into three types: 1) sub-conscious (or  pre-attentive?) 2) cognitive, requiring attention and changing user and context as a result 3) narrative, in which a sequence of interactions is had with a product.  Is the point of this just to introduce a vocabulary?

      I'm at DIS2004 in Boston this week! The conference hasn't even started, but thanks to my next-door neighbor, UI teammate, and buddy  urlLink Chad Thornton , I met many interesting people over dinner and drinks this evening and the learning has already begun.  We ended up talking about persona-based design and I asked my CS247A rant-y question that I have yet to get a good answer to: What are the ethical implications of  urlLink persona based design  when it is based on personas built off of the *current* demographic of a user group? What subtle values get embedded in software designed, say, for personas representing the male sysadmin population but no women?  What I learned is that  urlLink Robert Reimmann  thought about it and thought it was an interesting open question. One of the problems is that for formal persona building, you base personas on the existing user group. But Robert suggested that you can use other data -- from surveys, existing research, etc -- to build provisional personas to expand thinking about design decisions and task scenarios that the interface should manage. He admitted that the answer seemed a slipperly slope though.  He definitely acknowledged that it's a really interesting question, but he also put it in perspective, pointing out that we already have so long to go to create software that is effective at all. "Who is it effective for?" seems a secondary question.  Also,  urlLink Abigail Travis  and I started talking about the cultural situatedness, as well as aesthetics as being integral to the task of creating a functional UI. She told me about a talk she saw by someone from Microsoft describing the process of internationalizing the Tablet PC. They found that while in western cultures, we value whitespace greatly, in China, an empty desktop -- whitespace -- was seen as wasted space and the user experience was considered less valuable. According to MS via Abigail, this is also evident in comparing western newspaper layouts to Chinese newspaper layouts. Some googling revealed no MS papers on this, but I did find an interesting poster on cultural concerns in UI decision making form 1998:  urlLink Integrating Culture Into User-Interface Design   I found this especially interesting because Google is all about that minimalist design and our home page is all whitespace. I wonder what our presence in China is, compared to other search options.  I'll report what more I find!
