      Hey babe....  Well, it is the weekend...Finally.  Last night me, my bf, Nicole and her bf Jason went to the movies and saw The Village...pretty good, highly recommend it.  This morning my bf and I got up and we got some breakfast and did some running around...mainly clothes shopping for me...lol.  I'm at home and going to take a nap here in a bit before I go and work at my part-time job.  I just wanted to tell you that I'm not upset you didn't "chat" with me on Wednesday while you were at work.  I knew you were extremely busy with leaving and being gone for such a long time.  But, yeah I'm upset you couldn't take a second to call and personally tell me bye.  I wish I would have know you weren't going to call, and I so should have known you weren't like previous times, so I could have done something else instead of go straight home and wait for you to call.  That message on Yahoo was so impersonal...I think it crushed me more than the non-phone call.    You've said oh "I have these feelings for you", "I care about you" and so on, but I really think a quick phone call would have shown that.  I kept thinking all day and night Wednesday "he wouldn't leave without calling and saying bye"....  I think these next couple weeks will be good for us, well especially for you since you need a vacation =)  Also, I don't think I'm going to write anymore on here...I thought it would be nice for you to read about my days without talking to you, but I'm really hurt right now.  But I do want to know when you are back safe from your vacation =)  You can do that however ... personal or impersonal =)  love ya  cara

      What a NICE day outside!!!  I LOOOOVVEEEE this weather!!!!  Yesterday I had my training class downtown at our training building and that is also where our billing office is too.  They are sooo lucky...they are right in the heart of dowtown.  So on my lunch, I made a friend with this girl in my class, and so we did some walking around downtown.....to the Circle and then to Military Park which is several blocks down and across the street.  Sooooo pretty =)  Tons of benches and tables to sit and then a beautiful fountain =)  I didn't want to go back from lunch =)   Monday night the State Fair was sooooo much fun =)  I love going there, so much that I'm going again on Saturday since there will be more time and all.  We didn't end up getting to the fair until after 7pm....got to see the Circle City Cloggers...LoL.  There is some older people in there and they are sooooo cute =)  awww.  Then Keltic Motion ... Irish dancers were on at 8pm and I really like watching them.  Their dances tell stories lol.  Jennifer (my friend from work)...her friend Tim went with us and him and I always make up stories to go along with the dances....and we crack each other up.  Then we went to get fair food!!  YYYUUMMMY.  I got some curly fries and ate some of them and then went and had a slice of pizza...YUM....LoL.  I can't wait to go back Saturday to see more of the Fair.  The cloggers and Irish dancers will be there again too!!!  How fun =)  I need to get back to work and finish up some things since I was out yesterday.  I hope you enjoyed your vacation =)  and I hope you are back safe and sound =)  Talk to you later.

      I wish Monday was a part of the weekend so we would have 3-day weekends, but then would Tuesdays be like this too?  LoL  I had a very hard time getting up this morning, dreading coming in here.  But overall, I guess it hasn't been that bad of a day.  I drew up some new arrangements and gave to my boss about re-arranging my cube and the file clerk's cube.   So basically swap them two over here and then move me and my desk over on the other side.  My cube is huge and when Marsha moves out, I'm afraid my boss would put one of them in here.  So I gave her my "drawings" lol and she really loved them!!  She was all excited, which made me excited =)  Marsha won't be moved out until the end of the month though.  Tomorrow I have an all day training class out of the office....it will be mighty boring...oh well, gets me out of here I guess.   I'm sooooo excited!!  Tonight I'm going to the State Fair!!!  woohoo =)  I LOVE going to the State Fair to watch the cloggers and the Irish dancers...LOL.  They fancinate me.  My friend from work and her friend and I am going after work =)  I can't believe about the hurricane in Florida =(  How sad.  Hopefully none of your family experienced any damange or what not.  I'm glad my hotel is still standing.  I'm looking forward to my vacation next month =)  I can't wait to go to the beach and just relax =)  Also, we are planning on going to Ron Jon's Surf Shop....probably in Orlando, since Coco Beach would be too far to drive.  Oh well, just as long as we go, that is all that matters =)  Well I'm going to get back to work....so on Wednesday when I get back, you should be back =)

      Wow, my last entry was Monday, I better write one =)  Last night I had a dream about you...lol nothing "exciting".  Just that you were signed on yahoo while over there, like I said nothing exciting.  Probably a sign to write you.   Nothing much has been going on.  I have been soooo busy at work today.  Only have an hour left.  Then I have to go get some things at the grocery b/c we are having a pitch in at work since two of our co-workers are leaving this month.  Tomorrow night my b/f and I are going down to Brown County for the weekend.  We are renting a cabin..lol lets hope it has electricity.  Then we are going to do some horse-back riding on Saturday...and I have not done that since I was like 6 years old.   About a week left till you get back.  I can't wait to talk to you again =)  I'm going to finish up some stuff and get out of here =)  Muuuaaahhh I miss you a lot.

      Well today it was the Brickyard....last huge race of the year....so glad. Indy will be back to normal =) ... I spent the day by the pool and got a little red so I am in need of someone to rub some lotion on me. Nothing much happened this weekend. Saturday night, we went down to Danielle's parent's house and had a cook out. They have a "lake" in their backyard and sooo I tried to do some fishing. LoL so it took me a bit to learn to cast and my boyfriend was getting irritated with me. I would try and cast so it would land right in front of me, but for some reason the damn line would veer to the right. Then we had a huge bon-fire and sat around and drank some. So overall, it was a really good night.  I hope you are having a good time and I just want to tell you that I miss you =) Can't wait to talk to you again.  cara

      Well, it has been a week since you have left.  I'm sure you are probably enjoying yourself over there.  I changed my mind about writing because I want you to know when you get back how much i've miss you.  I have been super busy at work, taking on more of the doctors and scheduling their surgeries and stuff.  I can't wait till this weekend to be off work and not do anything =)  This week has been hmmm I don' know.  My friend Danielle (we haven't spoke in 2 years) was trying to conact me.  She emailed two of my friends wanting to get a hold of me.  Then one night I saw her number on my caller id.  I called her Tuesday night and we talked for over an hour about things.  After she got married we lost contact.   She said it was mainly because I was still good friends with her ex and we would do stuff and she and her new husband were "uncomfortable" with that.  I just think that was a basic cop-out.  It's not like Michael and I hung out everyday.  Oh well.  I just let her go on and I didn't say much.  She then told me that she has been really sick lately.  They found some tumor on her brain which has been causing high levels of insulin and polycystic ovary disease - meaning she can't or will have a very hard time having kids.  Sooo and they are trying to "shrink" the tumor before they try the radiation.  So she told me that "life is too short" and wanted to make things right between us.  Which of course I don't have a problem with because we had tons of fun together.  So we will see how this goes.   Today I'm meeting my friend over at Riley to pick up an algebra book!!  woohoo it will save me 100 bucks!!!  And then I found someone who has a graphing calculator I can borrow which will save me another 100 bucks!!!  Helps me out a lot.  My first class is on Wed 8/25 and my other class is on Sat 8/28....yeah I'm taking a Saturday class ... what was a thinking!! Oh well, it is only from 820am-1150am...and I up usually by that time on Saturdays.  Then still on Tuesdays and Thursdays I will have my aerobics classes.  Tonight is the last night for aerobics for this semester....they will start back up the week of Aug 23rd and will have a class offered every night!!!   Okay babe, I'm going to get back to work now =(  I miss talking to you.  And by the way...I might get my own cube soon =)  Yay!!!   bye babe!!
