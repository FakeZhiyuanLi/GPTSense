      Bored am i on this summer's last sunday as  i attempt to make the best of whats left. So last thursday i got back from the JH Pendleton YLC  ...damn it was boring. despuite the boredom i did learn a thing or two about the American way. As you may know  ive been working on a few songs lately ( each of which is dedicated to a friend) and  ive kind of quit  on the funeral one and am at a roadblock  for Haleigh's. Ive completely changed everything about the one dedicated to Herumi. the lyrics are that of a lovesick ballad and instead of guitar and back up instruments, it is solely piano, but rather simplistic. strangely  i consider it my best love song  ive written and the irony is that the girl to whom i am writing it(Herumi) is not even my GF. i think i shall alter haleigh's as well. i guess the problem is that everything about it is too complicated...that damn solo.   despite my end of summer blues i do feel strangely enthusiastic about the upcoming schoolyear. maybe ill meet a nice, pretty, sweet, academically inclined girl whose innocence accentuates her natural beauty...but also strong..like it would take more than one bullet to stop her. it would also be cool if she knew how to play an instrument or knew carpentry or steel welding. damn..maybe  i should find a girl who works at home depot. Eh screw it, my two loves as of now are school and Rock n Roll..GO ABSTINENCE!  k so ive been saving up for a sniper air rifle. i shall get it soon. i cant wait to kill that damn crow terrorizing my dog. i swear i will shoot that things head clean off it neck.  well now i am off to the 32nd street Naval Exchange to get some new clothes.
