         Well i am really bored and i dont feel like going to bed...or anything. i went swimming today and the chlorine in the pool always makes me sleepy. mabye it is some kind of narcotic drug.   today was so fun! my friend tara was in her eye appointment and heather needed to go to work but her truck was back at taras, so we hop in taras car and i drove her to taras and dropped her off, then drove taras car back by myself and parked it.. i dont even have my lisence yet....tara thought it was funny though.  I am ready to drive. i have been on a rage to just get up and go. i have been 16 since last november, and i still havent gotten my license because my mom waited until 2 months before i turn 16 to get my learners and the GA law says u have to have ur learners for 1 year no matter what age u are before u can get ur license. it SUX!!! god it sucks....uuurg well before i get mad or something im gonna go. bye

       I saw you yesterday as you began your daily chores.   You awoke without kneeling to pray.   As a matter of fact, you didn't even bless your meals, or   pray before going to bed last night.   You are so unthankful,   I like that about you.   I cannot tell you how glad I am that you  have not changed your way of living,   Fool, you are mine.   Remember,you and I have been going steady for years,   and I still don't love you yet.   As a matter of fact, I hate you,   because I hate God.   I am only using you to get even with God.   He kicked me out of heaven,   and I'm going to use you as long as possible to pay him back.   You see, Fool, GOD LOVES YOU and   HE has great plans in store for you.   But you have yielded your life to me,   and I'm going to make your life a   living hell. That way, we'll be together twice.   This will really hurt God.   Thanks to you, I'm really showing Him who's boss in your life with   all of the good times we've had.   We have been watching dirty   cursing people out,   stealing,   lying,   being hypocritical,   fornicating,   overeating,   telling dirty jokes,   gossiping,   being judgmental,   back stabbing people,   disrespecting adults,   and those in leadership positions,   no respect for the Church,   bad attitudes.   SURELY you don't want to give all this up.   Come on, Fool, let's burn together forever.   I've got some hot plans for us.   This is just a letter of appreciation from me to you.   I'd like to say "THANKS" for letting me use you for most of your foolish life.   You are so gullible, I laugh at you.   When you are tempted to sin,   you give in... HA HA HA, you make me sick.   Sin is beginning to take it's toll on your life.   You look 20 years older, and now, I need new blood.   So go ahead and teach some children how to sin.   All you have to do is   smoke,   get drunk or drink while underaged,   cheat,   gossip,   fornicate,   and live being as selfish as possible.   Do all of this in the presence of children and they will do it too.   Kids are like that.   Well, Fool, I have to let you go for now.   I'll be back in a couple of seconds to tempt you again.   If you were smart, you would run somewhere, confess you sins, live for God with what   little bit of life that you have left.   It's not my nature to warn anyone,   but to be your age and still sinning,   it's becoming a bit ridiculous.   Don't get me wrong,   I still hate you.   IT'S JUST THAT YOU'D MAKE A BETTER FOOL FOR CHRIST.      If you think this is freaky...then that is good. It is meant to be a little freakish. but its the truth. If you do not want to go to Hell when you die, except Jesus as your Lord and Savior and you shall live with Him in Heaven when you die....

      That Special Day  The rush of the day starts early Stress and craziness break loose I have to be here and there, I'm everywhere I am in need of an energy boost  Hair and makeup are getting done I'm feeling glamorous and free The clock is ticking by slowly And everyone is waiting for the bride-to-be  A vale slips over my face And I grab the bundle of flowers I feel like nothing could go wrong And that I have unbelievable powers  I hear the music start to play The doors open and there you are You smile and I see a tear fall down I can't believe we've come this far  I walk the isle so happy and joyful Finally I reach you and you take my hand We turn to the minister and smile so big My knees feel weak as we both stand  Finally the end is coming And we feel our love so true The crowd is silent and waiting As we both grin and say "I do"  The kiss is soft and sweet We are finally bound as one I feel like a million bucks And your heart is what I have won  ::::BEEEEEPPPPPP BEEEEEEPPPPPP:::::  I open my eyes and realize I am still 16, and far from that day That I can marry the one I love Man! I can't wait for that day!    I wrote that on June 2.(9 month anniversary with my boyfriend cody)  I LOVE YOU JOHN CODY LORD
