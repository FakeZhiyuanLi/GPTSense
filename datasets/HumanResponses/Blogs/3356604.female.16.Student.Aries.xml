      Yes. Living Hell. The people who organise the International Baccalaurate highschool diploma program at my school are making my life unbearably difficult. My weekend has been spent trying to forget this fact. Last year, when I chose my subjects I decided to chose Chemistry, with the idea that it would probably help me out later on in life and give me lots of juicy options considering I had no idea whatsoever what career I would chose. That was last year. I decided this year that I want to be a journalist, and to become a journalist, I have no real need for Chemistry. With this new information I decided at the start of this term to change into Environmental Systems, and all was joyful. For one week, before they told me that I actually, if I follow the IB code correctly, am forbidden to take Biology and Environmental Systems together. This has left me in a very unhappy situation, seeing as I essentially now have to chose between Chemistry with an incredibly mentally challenged teacher or Economics which I have missed out on for an entire term (I only have like 6 more and not to mention exams in a month). Sigh, woe is me. Anyway, this means a sleepless night for me as I toss and turn trying to figure out which will be more beneficial to me in future.   Anyway, I may post later about the results of my STUPID AND POINTLESS DILEMMA!!!  Catch ya

      Yes, my dears, last night was indeed the last night of the production 'Hello, Dolly!' Last night was also a pretty awesome night. It was my grandmother's birthday, so she came and watched the play along with my aunt, uncle and cousin and some other family friends that I met up with afterwards. I think they all enjoyed the play, which is about 50% of the point of putting on a play. Then there were the presentations, which involved several 'Hello, Dolly!' songs having their words changed so they were about both the Musical Director, Tina, and the Director, Annette. Then Annette had written a poem thanking everyone she could possibly have thanked, and lots of people were given out cards and things. After all that, we had a sing along and ate Marcel's cake (which was amazing...he'd made this huge cherry/chocolate cake and then with a toothpick drawn in chocolate the likenesses of the leads and the BATS logo on white chocolate. He said it took him 12 hours...I said to Adam, that was 11 hours more than I would be willing to spend on a cake) and then my dad said that he wanted to take my brother and sister home. I didn't really want to leave, but Adam, bless him, said he'd drive me home. Dad seemed about as cool with that as he'd ever be, so I was able to stay until almost two, dancing, singing and having an awesome time. As soon as I got home, I washed my hair (I never, ever will have to sleep with it like that again!) and fell into bed. I got up at about 3-ish this afternoon.

      Today, ladies and gentlemen, is my last day of school. I found out this morning my last exam doesn't start until 2 o'clock this afternoon which gives me plenty of time to watch DVDs, check my email, talk to my friends...oh, and study I suppose. This coming weekend, plus this coming holiday, is going to be pretty awesome -touches wood- beginning with today, the LAST DAY OF SCHOOL! I just got this completely hilarious email from Gaya, bagging the entire hell out of the IB. If anyone who hasn't got it wants it, email me and I'll forward it on. Last night I had BATS rehearsal -sly look- and I cut absolute sick at my brother and sister who wouldn't leave me and Adam alone. Bloody siblings, especially Bonnie who you think by now would appreciate that I would not like to associate brother/sister relationships with him. I have to go...computer admin is kicking me off. Later.  OK, I'm back now...and there is substantially less bouncing, but that's only because I got my marks back for some more of my exams -shudders-. Oh well, I didn't fail, so I'm not too worried. Just slightly disappointed. Yes, these holidays are going to be good. Tomorrow my family is going to the city for my sister's birthday, and I still haven't bought her anything 'cause I am so broke! Oh well, tomorrow I'll get her something. Then I have BATS, Saturday I have a driving lesson then BATS, Sunday I'll probably be trashed and then Wednesday I'm going to the movies with Adam. Awesome! Anyway, this time I'm really going. Bye!

      No, sadly it isn't. That's ok, I can wait...but I think this is the first time that I really am excited about going to BATS rehearsal. -goofy grin- Something interesting happened today, and yes I am going to talk about it. A boy I met a month or so ago messaged me on my mobile asking me to lunch on Sunday. Unfortunately, my love life is otherwise directed currently, so I declined as nicely as possible. This guy, Phil, I have met once and after vigorous texting on his part it seemed to me, and no doubt to him, that something might happen. However, he didn't ring or anything, and I told him I didn't really want to just text and chat on the net, and that I wanted a more realistic relationship. After that, I didn't really hear from him. After past experiences, I have decided that if I have to work too hard to win someone's affection, or to get their attention, it's not worth it and I'm just wasting my time. I informed him, anyway, that I was with someone else and thankyou for inviting me. I didn't even know the guy, and I think I'm much better off at the moment. Oh, before I forget, I was in my Biology exam with about 10 minutes left, when our Biology teacher walked in and started distributing homework he wanted us to do during the holidays. I was astounded. The other kids in my class and I started laughing at the absurdity of it. I mean really, that is taking homework WAY too far.

      That is my Indonesian Exam mark!!! Yes!!! My Indo Essay must've been good then! I'm so stoked, I don't know what to do. I know, I'll write a blog! Today I had a maths exam, but that's not very interesting or happy or even funny. I don't really feel like talking about it. I don't feel like studying or anything, I don't even care about bloody exams. I'm in such a great mood. -grins- Yesterday was hilarious at BATS (I seem to spend all my time there) so I'll rave about that. The looks Adam and I were getting from people whilst we held hands or whatever were classic. One especially funny case was when Tina, the music director, walked past us and did a double take. She gave us a knowing look and said "is there something I should know about." We looked at each other and shrugged, then turned to Tina who promptly screamed with delight and ran into the supper room. When I went in there later on to fix my lipstick (ugh, I hate lipstick) she dragged her husband in and pointed at me saying "That's Harry, you know Harry." A few teachers at my school are also involved in BATS and I've had a few interesting comments today as well. One Maths teacher, Mr. Paul Sczuzr (pronounced stewer) saw me today and said to his friend, and my Maths teacher, Mr. Tom Kerr "Harry's got a new boyfriend." Mr Kerr said in a very honest and heartfelt tone "That's great Harry." before adding "Even though people said you couldn't get I boyfriend I always knew you could." Typical. Hehehe, wait 'til I get my revenge! Mrs Eleanor Richards came and talked to my friend Jessica 'Jimmy' Keep about her Geography exam and she kept looking at me as though indecisive about whether or not to say something. When I asked her whether she had been at BATS yesterday, she took the opportunity to start raving about Adam to Jimmy and how nice he is and how cute the whole thing was. It's strange; at the second most stressful time of the year, I am still managing to have an absolute blast with my friends, BATS and my guy.

      ...but I'm having enough trobble focusing on writing this...where am I again? Due to the extravagence of my aforementioned hair for the play, I am obliged to sleep on my stomach at night to prevent it from going flat and awful (though in popular opinion, it is already awful. Micheal, a little guy from BATS made the charming comment today that it looks as though I have a rat stuck on my had with many 'rat's-tails' dangling down. Lovely). Anyway, this means that by sleeping on my stomach, I'm also sleeping on my face which in turn restricts my breathing. To add another element of adventure, I have to stay about one quarter concious all night so I don't roll over and destroy my cursed hair. Now that I've washed my hair (three shampoos and a 5-minute condition)I shall enjoy sleeping tonight! I've got a maths exam tomorrow, for which I am happily avoiding studying for. I've made myself a deal that I will study after I eat dinner. Let's see if I can hold up my end of the deal...Geez I feel like a hug, and it's a nice feeling these days to know that I actually have someone to hug. I'll have to use that resource to its full extent...Bye!!

      ...between study, CAS and having a life? Why? Half the time people expect me to have all three. I AM NOT SUPERWOMAN, I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TIME! Then again, I could cut down on the me-time and not read, watch T.V. or go on the internet, post a blog and whinge about my life like an ungrateful brat. Which, by the way, I hope I am not. On the upside, BATS has become considerably more enjoyable now that there is an extra element involved. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy it before, but Adam sort of makes it a little more interesting. Last night was lots of fun. To raise money to support our little theatrical company, BATS organises a pizza night for the cast and this consequently leads to a party which means lots of dancing and laughing to songs that everyone knows. Even if you don't know the songs you dance, and I had an absolute ball. However, I am also starting to notice a downside to BATS, and that is the dire effect the makeup is having on my already less-than-perfect skin. -sigh- Oh well, the prices we pay, hey? In other news, I started exams two days ago. I think I have passed them all, and my Indonesian exam I think went particularly well. I had to write an essay, and the topic I chose was a letter of complaint to an imaginary hotel manager. (My mother said, 'Complaining? But you're terrible at complaining.' I guess sarcasm is below nobody.) I called the hotel, Hotel Bau, which means smelly hotel in English. I went on to talk about certain things that were amiss, and then as a flourish put in a part about me trying to contact the staff by ringing room service, the manager, the reception with no decent answer except for reception finally ringing me back, but only to ask me to stop ringing people. My amount of study has been quite negligible, and yesterday instead of studying the format for a commentary I had to do for my English exam I wrote Cedrik (ooh, a new character in the plot...more about him another day) a 500 word CAS essay. He thinks he owes me like 100 favours, and he's probably right. I do indulge him more than I should perhaps, but he's one of my closest friends, if not my closest, and I don't care about who owes whom. Anyway, he has an essay, so I don't have to worry about him failing the CAS component for the moment. Anyway, I should probably go study...or at least find something to do that is closer to study than this. Later.

      And how are you today? Isn't that nice...I'm talking to a fictitious character from a musical that is taking up all my free time and leaving me too tired to do anything in the time that is not free. Ah well, the prices we pay...Last night was opening night, and I have to say that aside several mishaps that caused me and several others to laugh uncontrolledly onstage the play went rather well. The first mishap was when the leading man said "I'm not going to ask you to marry you" which was followed by 'Dolly' saying things like "Well I wouldn't marry me either" and "I'm turning me down.' All funny stuff. Then one of the cast farted, which was audible onstage even though he'd retreated far into the backstage. Finally, the lead man got so carried away with shouting he had an enormous glob of saliva on his chin. And they expect us to be serious...Anyway, at the moment I'm sitting at my computer with my head wrapped in butter yellow silk. Yesterday I had my hair done, and the only thing to save it from being destroyed whilst I toss and turn in my sleep is a can of hairspray and silk to wrap it in. I'm sure I look quite strange at the moment with my makeshift turban, brown and blue scarf, dressing gown covered in flying pigs, pyjamas and ug-boots at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Oh well, what can you do?

      So much work to do...so little incentive. I took yesterday off because I felt like absolute crap. Like, I had a fever and I felt nauseous and just plain crap. I even tried to get some stupid f***ing Chemistry study, but I think all that did was make me more sick, lol. Anyway, I dragged myself out of bed today, and after popping a panadol I let myself be driven to school. Ugh, a whole day of doing nothing remotely interesting (except possibly Geo, 'cause we're doing mapping) and me feeling crap all because of moronic, pointless, messed up CHEMISTRY. -breaks something- I had a test today, and the stupid teacher won't let you take the test if you're away, and gives you zero. I'm so annoyed, I like haven't eaten anything today excepting 3/4 a piece of toast and 1/4 mueslie bar. I don't even feel like eating, which means that I MUST be sick. Tonight I have more BATS (Broadford Ametuer Theatrical Society) rehearsal, and I'm gonna be so wreaked...price you pay for CAS though I guess. For all those non-IB people, CAS is a whole bunch of hours of either sport, service or something creative...big timewaster, and it, like the IB, is taking over my life. I found out I've got exams starting next Thursday. Can we say, OH SHIT!!!!! I'm going to have to study this year. No more stuffing round like previous years. Just goes to show how arrogant I am. Fifth year at TKIS and I still think I'm above study. Hehehe, I guess these exams are gonna teach me a thing or two. Anywho, must get going...only cause I don't have anything else to write really.

      My weekend started 10 o'clock on a Saturday morning. I woke up, and went to check my mobile phone. I had three messages, so thinking my usual 'somebody loves me' I went to investigate. I found that all three were from my most recent boyfriend, and in between apologising profusely, he managed to convey that he didn't think it would work out. This left me in a state of a mixture of confusion, annoyance and guilt. Confusion as to why he didn't talk to me about this, annoyance because he did it over text message and guilt because I didn't feel half as bad as I should have.&nbsp; I can't really remember how I spent the rest of the day...I think I probably read, went on the internet and then at some stage cooked dinner. Fun-diddly-un. After dinner, my friend Lauren came over, and we talked and hung out and stuff until at about 9 I got a VERY interesting phone-call. Jason, a friend of mine who is spending a school year in Japan, rang me from his home in Tokyo. He had some really great stuff to tell me, but I have to publish one of his little anecdotes, because it was truly hilarious.  &nbsp; Jason was riding his bike through the city (which is basically the cheapest and most effective way of travelling) and stacked it. The bike landed on his leg, and the kickstand drove itself deep into his calf muscle. Naturally, this was not an ideal place for the kickstand to be, so he removed it rather promptly. Walking in what would be the general direction of the hospital, he was passed by a teacher of his who saw his bleeding leg and suggested that he go to hospital...before driving off leaving Jason behind. When Jason made it to the hospital, sitting on the operating table, he was surrounded by an assortment of Japanese doctors commenting on how painful his injury looked. Finally, one of the nurses found a rather large needle and jammed it into his leg muscle, claiming it to be for anesthetic purposes. Then, she advised Jason to hold onto something. Jason asked "Didn't you just give me an anesthetic?" to which the nurse replied confidently "Oh, that's not going to be enough..." Next, a doctor stuck his hand into the wound (which was 8cm long and about 3 inches deep if I recall correctly) and was accompanied by the harmonies of a sound which Jason asked me to compare with the sound of a newly boiled potato being shoved up the rear-end of a donkey. &nbsp; I was in stitches (no pun intended...but now that it's here...) I laughed so much. Anyway, Lauren and I talked to Jason, then went to bed. This morning we got up fairly early and had brekky (french toast) and got ready to go to Mt. Buller. Dad drove myself, Lauren, Bonnie, Fletcher and his friend Josh up to Mansfield where we rented tyre chains and two toboggans. From there we headed to the mountain which was decoratively capped with clean white snow. Half an hour of nauseating turning up the stupid mountain we arrived at the snow (This is a big thing for me, for I've only been to the snow once before when I was really little). Lauren and I watched the kids stack themselves on the slopes for a while before heading to the kiosk for hot chocolate and normal chocolate. About an hour later we all headed to the village and looked around there, and Lauren, Bonnie and I orded a serve of pancakes for the pancake parlour (I love being a fat lard) with bacon and maple syrup and more butter than necessary. Then we caught the shuttle back down to the toboggan slope. I decided to have a go, and on my first run I shot down the hill screaming profanity, warnings and just plain screaming. On my last go, I was racing my brother and rocketted down the hillside, veering far too much to the right, went up a bank of snow and missed a signpost by several inches before nearly stacking the sled on two innocent bystanders. What fun! Anyway, after that we had a bit of a snowball fight, then packed it up and drove home.

      I stayed at my Aunt's yesterday, after cleaning the house so it would look somewhat respectable for the people coming to look at it. When she came to pick me up, she helped with the cleaning a lot, then we drove to Hidden Valley to pick up my cousin. We went through Kilmore, and when Annie stopped to get petrol, I saw that Adam was in the video store there. I went and said 'Hi' and then we went on our way. Ellie was telling me about the lamb they had adopted, aptly named Patch for the black spot around its eye. When we arrived we saw that there were two black lambs as well, which I wanted to name Montague and Capulet. When we came back to them a few minutes later to feed them, Capulet (he has a white 'cap' on his head by the way) escaped into the paddock. Also, because the lambs are quite old and not used to humans and therefore bottle-feeding, the only way to get them to drink the milk is by cathing them round their forequarters, holding their bodies with your knees and forcing their mouths open until they realise "Oh, there's milk in this..." Multiply that by three, add some T.V, good food and a book and you've got my day until about 12 this morning. I tried to assist my cousin with making her hair curly, but all we got were some fetching waves. With my hair, it's like for instant curls, just add water! Then, when Dad and I came home at about 1, we found that our dog was missing. After searching our house, our property, the road, the local pound, ringing the vet and calling his name constantly...we got a call from a lady who lives 5km away saying she's found a dog that reminds her a lot of ours. Stupid dog, turns out he had walked, or ran, over 5km and ended up miserable and alone in Reedy Creek. The lady reckons he had followed a jogger or something. Oh well, I shall sleep easily tonight knowing he isn't either dead or becoming swiftly responsible for the death of other local animals.

      Been about a week since my last entry...let me see, what has happened that would in any way be interesting to a reader? I can't remember Thursday or Friday, so I won't write about those. When I'm on holidays, it's as though my whole sense of time just evaporates. Anyway, Saturday I went to the movies again...and now, I am so sick of going to the movies I can't even begin to explain. I saw Mean Girls with my sister, and that was alright. Pretty funny with good morals. Uh, we spent way to long at an airport, to meet up with a Canadian woman who used to live locally and was friends with my mum. I wasn't too happy, considering I was pissed off at my sister already and the first thing the woman said to me was how much me and my sister look alike. Ugh. Then my sister flew to Adelaide to watch our cousin, so that at least gives us a bit of a break. She seems to find it amusing to pretend to be hurt or in trouble, and then laugh uproarously when I try to help her out. As anyone who knows me can imagine, I find this less than amusing. Perhaps for Christmas I should buy her a copy of "the Boy Who Cried Wolf? Sunday I stayed at my Grandma's, and considering I was feeling a bit crook, spent most of that time in bed asleep. Yesterday I went to a party down my road a bit with Adam, and that was OK. I spent most of my time holding people's heads while they threw up...but hey, the price I pay for not drinking myself hey? One girl I helped is my friend, so that's ok...but this other girl was someone I had never met and she was sick as a dog, so to speak. Heh, she kept asking me to let her sleep...but I decided that if she fell asleep we might have some difficulty waking her up. Oh well, I guess at least I got to spend SOME time with Adam, and catch up with Heather, whose party it was. I really am hopeless at keeping in touch with old friends. Anyway, must dash. Ciao

      Yesterday was pretty cool, (nothing interesting enough happened today, save me mowing a lawn, for me to talk about today) considering I got to go to Epping with Adam to see both Shrek 2 and Spiderman 2. Interestingly, we met up with Alysha as soon as we got there. She was seeing the movie with her mum and siblings, so we decided to see it with them and see spiderman later. Shrek was hilarious, the best bit I think was the short at the end, when Dragon meets up with Donkey. I won't spoil it, but see it and know what I mean. We went and had lunch, which was interesting, because Alysha's reappearing cousin and his posse of white-jumpered goons kept reappearing. I also had to shop for my sister's birthday present, which was about 5 days overdue, and ended up purchasing some really nice stich perfume and then some psycho stripey socks. Then Adam and I bid our farewells to Alysha and her lot, and went to see spiderman. I didn't mind seeing two movies in one day, it was quite fun really, but I don't think I'll do it too often. I think by the end of it I had been sitting down for way too long. Oh, by the way, see Shrek and Spiderman...they are both excellent.

      Well it's been a while...what, like two weeks? Hehehe...I haven't really had all that much to write about I guess. I saw I, Robot on the weekend and it was pretty good. Like, same theme as Bicentenial Man and A.I. but with more action. Will Smith was really good...for any female readers, take your boyfriend or whatever and let him enjoy the action while you drool shamelessly over Will's nude body in the first scene. It was a pretty good movie nonetheless, and the storyline was pretty decent and logical and interesting. We (my Dad and I) drove through Kilmore on our way to the movies 'cause I had to drop of my resume in the newsagents -crosses fingers- and we decided to ask the twins whether they wanted to come too. He, half an hour later they drag their sleepy selves from their house and we were off. I had to do some shopping too, so it was pretty fun dragging those two round the plaza whilst my dad went to look for a scanner or something like that. Anyway, that night we went to my aunt's for my uncle's birthday dinner rugby match do, and I met the most fuckwitted guy in my life. His name was like Huey, or something and his wife and daughter were lovely but this guy was off his head. I came into the lounge where they were watching the Wallaby-Springbuck match and happened to stand in something wet. Naturally I'm all like "eaugh, what is this?" and he tells me it's wine that his wife spilt and he stepped into it to, and brandishes his own wet sock. I wonder aloud whether or not I should wipe it up, and he tells me no, don't bring attention to it...remember etiquette? Anyway, I gave him a weird look, cause who does this stranger think he is giving me a lecture in mannars and tell him that I was merely wondering whether it was water or something else. He smiles and tells me wine is mostly water with a little alcohol...(like he can talk)...and I just give him a look that plainly says...you dickhead, who the hell are you?  Anyway, there was a bit of a blue about the fire going out so I got up to see what I could do to fix it. The same fuckhead comes over and says "You're a good girl, a pacifist..." and I'm all like yeah whatever. Then he tries to help by trying to set a tissue alight. I kid you not...a single tissue. When he failed miserably, I went to look for firelighters. By the time I came back without firelighters, Huey was standing there a little lost. I pointlessly blew on the single tissue, and the whole thing burst into flame before Huey excitedly (and without a doubt, drunkedly) placed a large log on it. For all those who are not pyromaniacs or farmers, doing this is completely useless because the log will merely smother the small flame. I pointed out several times that we'd either need to find kindling or other suitable fuel, but to no avail. Eventually Bruce came with the box of firelighters, and let Huey do the honours of lighting them, an action that surely has a prerequirement of years of training, and I left the boys to bask in the glory of creating fire. Later, Bruce brings Huey back to the rest of the people, who is greated with uproarous cheering. Typical.  Oh, and today I have had the absolute pleasure of meeting two ex-boyfriends as well as someone I got with in the span of about 15 minutes. Jess, I think I'm spending too much time with you!!
