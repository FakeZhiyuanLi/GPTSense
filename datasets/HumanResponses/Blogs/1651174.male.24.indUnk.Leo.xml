       Break out the calculator  So I just read down the page some and realized Justin calculated out 20 years into minutes...I am resisting the very strong engineering urge to break out my cheap CASIO (with graphical menu!) and check units....no....put down the calculator....  Thank goodness we have Kami on board to balance us out some...John Cusack would only improve the ratio.  In other news, the zipper on my jacket seems to be stuck...it's going to be a very warm day....

      Justin says I should use my bored time to post another blog entry, so here goes:  There's something on my mind, so now it's going in this blog.  Hopefully, the person about which I'm gonna write will never read this cuz that could be somewhat embarassing.  On Wednesday, I was leaving work, and so I headed to the elevator.  There was a guy standing at the elevator, and he introduced himself to me.  Let's call him "A."   Anyhow, we had a very nice talk as we left the building.  Eventually A and I parted ways because we had to catch buses at different places.  That night, I was looking around Friendster, and who do you think I saw?  That's right, "A!"  What a crazy coincidence, huh?    Anyhow, I've been hoping all day to run into him, but it seems unlikely cuz I very rarely see people from the other offices on the floor.  I've even taken a couple more elevator trips than usual today.  So I have a little crush, and I might even consider asking A out (I know from his Friendster profile that he's single) if only I would see him again.  But I've been working at Odyssey for 3 months and I've only seen him maybe 3 times, with Wednesday marking our first conversation so the odds don't seem very good.  Ah, the trials of romance....

        My Turn Again?  Sorry I haven't been participating too much.  Things have been super-busy at work.  Also, my sister is visiting from Australia, so we spent the first portion of the week cleaning, and we'll be spending the last portion of it entertaining.  By the way, I'm totally in favor of having John Cusack as a co-blogger.  Now, Justin, all you have to do is get him to agree.  And now I'm gonna go add this site as a link on my other blog.    I just have to add, after "Friends" ends this year, NBC is going to have a spin-off about Joey! It'll be interesting to see if it succeeds (like "Frasier") or flops.  I like Joey, so I hope it does well.  How you doin?

       TWFL  In response to a post on the message board by someone who reads more blogs than he updates....hmm, I guess that's all of us....  Freshman year I lived at the Clark Kerr dorm 30 miles from campus (ok, so it was only a 15 minute walk, but hey, I drove to class in high school).  My roommates were Jennifer and the Invisible Woman (ie, she was never there.  So Jennifer and I had a really big double)  Down the hall were Justin and his roommates, and downstairs were Kami (and her roomates) and Noah (and his).  We mingled, watched movies, avoided homework, dyed our hair, and redefined the term "hall sports" together.  Towards the end of that year, we attended a presentation on finding off-campus housing, as everyone was getting kicked out of the dorms (Berkeley has this policy of admitting more students than it can provide dorm space for).  Here we were, innocent, naive, sheltered....and being kicked out into the cold, cruel world of no rent control.  What else could we do but band together, put together a housing resume (I think I may still have a copy), and trek out the to far reaches of space (northside) to search for a slightly larger cardboard box.  In the end, after paying a hefty sum of money and seeing more than our fair share of 2 bedroom apartments trying to pass off as 4 bedroom, Jennifer, Justin, Noah, and I found a house on Francisco Street.  A house being taken over by ivy (and rats a few years later), but a house nonetheless.  A drafty, dark, scary house, but...anyways.  This being only 20 minutes away from campus by walking was considered quite a find (if not an excellent exercise program when you forgot your homework at home)  Kami had taken the other path and become an RA, with housing provided and more freshman than you could shake a stick at.  She had also become involved in an organization known as the Third World Liberation Front (those of you at Intel will be relieved to hear it was abbreviated to a FLA - TWLF) (Those of you not Intel-ified, FLA is my remake of TLA, which, (are you ready?) stands for "Three Letter Acronym").  Memory fails me here, but I believe there were some overnighters spent on campus in protest.  Somehow, someone (coughcoughNoah) renamed this effort TWFL (pronounced "Twiffle").  This was so irritating that it somehow became the name of our house.  And so a house named with capital letters and still outside the Greek system (logistically and geographically) was born.  And that my friends, is what TWFL means.  To 5 kids from Berkeley :)

       > John Cusack for Co-Blogger!   If you haven't heard, there was a "big" (meaning a few hundred bored college students) push on some college campuses to have  urlLink John Cusack run for President of the United States . I even printed out the poster for his campaign and posted it on my wall. Though, it turns out that Cusack (sometimes I like to think he would like me to call him John), doesn't want to run for president. He states,  urlLink "Yeah, it's pretty galling. But it would probably be a good idea -- if it wasn't me." . I don't presume to know Cusack's inner thoughts, but I could see how he would have no desire to mess around with such an ugly, and almost worthless, game. After all politics has been called the Hollywood for ugly people. And Johnny aint no ugly person...  And if you were wondering, yes, I do worship Mr. Cusack... Ok, maybe worship is a strong word... Does writing pointless blog entries count as worship? Err, how bout owning more John Cusack movies than all other movies combined (not quite true)? Sacrificing goats to His Johness on His birthday(not likely)? Well, ok, that last one certainly counts as worship...  So, what do you say Kami and Kate? Can I invite Johnnykins to join us as co-blogger? Unfortunately his 10,512,000 minutes (~20 years if I am not a complete moron) of fame would probably far outclass our combined 45 minutes. 10,512,045 Minutes of Fame would still make a good title. Right? Actually, I did have some serious, but obvious, suggestions for this blog. We should set up a message board and having links to our emails would be nice too… And you two should link to this page from your blogs, as you two are famous and I want to be famous as well. Anyway, J.C. if you are reading this, send me an email and we will commence negotiations for having you come on board!

      I guess it's my turn to post something....but I have nothing to say.  I use up all my wit and (semi) interesting thought in my other blog.  So you're just gonna be stuck with my brain's leftovers.  Well, I'm being drafted into actual work now.

       Inspirational Quotes  "I opened up a container of yogurt, and under the lid it said 'Please Try Again' because they were having a contest I was unaware of. But I though I might have opened the yogurt wrong...or maybe Yoplait was trying to inspire me, 'c'mon, Mitchell, don't give up. Please try again. A message of inspiration from your friends at Yoplait. Fruit on the bottom, hope on top.'"  --Mitch Hedberg  Time for me to check out this season's lipstick!    Rrriighhhtt.....

       > An Introduction   Welcome! So, I am Justin and you probably know me pretty well as you are probably Kate or Kami. However, for those that don't know me, I am the male side of the 45 minutes. I will talk about sports and the two K's will talk about lipstick or something. I am sure that is how it will go... Ok, hopefully I will come up with something other than sports to talk about, but I get a bit post-shy sometimes. Who wants to hear about my thoughts on Ecuadorian post-modern architecture (EPMA!) on the influence of Brazilian stained glass blowers (BSGB!)? Ok, I know nothing about architecture or stained glass that I didn’t learn in Jr. High. But, I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Kate’s and Kami’s blogs and I imagine I will enjoy sharing my thoughts. So, that is going to be my mission statement: Enjoy Sharing My Thoughts! Like the cheesy, worthless, supposedly motivational little slips of paper I have been getting with my paychecks the last couple of months… Some guy is getting paid to design these things… “FINISH IT…   RIGHT!  ” It screams to me from my paycheck… Oh gee, thanks… I was so going to finish it wrong, but then I remembered… I am here to finish it right, underline, exclamation mark…   Anyway, it is good to be here. Thank you Kate and Kami for providing this fun, interesting, and potentially informative little space on the web for us.

      Did I ever mention that polka dots make me laugh?  So this site makes me very happy.    Once, when I was a kid, my dad bought my mom a dress with polka dots that were really big at the top and the bottom and got progressively smaller towards the middle.   It was the most hilarious dress ever...  And what do the dots have to do with polka?

       Fantasy Football Players Wanted     Hey all... I was wondering if anyone would be interested in playing fantasy football with me and some friends. We are trying to get together at least 10 people to participate in a yahoo fantasy football team.  Fantasy baseball was a lot of fun and we are looking to carry over the fantasy craze into football and make sure we have more distractions from working. There may be a $10 per person entry fee that will all be used to reward the winners.  If you are interested send me an email message (any of mine would work but try jdunlap959@hotmail.com) or post a comment here.      Ok... Now back to tweaking my fantasy baseball team...

      I stop checking the site for a few weeks and look what happens.... someone  goes and posts this big long entry, changes the format. &nbsp; You know, just because you remembered your password... &nbsp; I'm not sure where I'm going with this.&nbsp; I do like the new template though :) &nbsp; And remember, 70% of all people think they're above average.&nbsp; It's nice to be part of that 20% minority :)&nbsp; I wonder if I can get a fellowship for that....

      Ooh, I like the new template!  Good choice.   Does this mean we're actually posting here again?  For real?  Should I link to this site on my blog?    Justin mentioned having a new laissez faire attitude about career stuff.   I've recently taken up a similar philosophy.   I have some major reservations about applying to law school--actually, it's not law school that worries me; it's being a lawyer.  But I know that law school seems really interesting, so I figure that I've just got to decide what works for me right now and worry about the future when it comes.  Besides, did you know that the average person changes careers 7 times?   And I've always considered myself above average, so....

      Awesome, I figured out my password and now have less excuses for why I don't post in this blog. There was a brief few minutes there where quite a few of my friends (one or two) seemed interested in reading what I posted here, but I think they have all long since forgotten about this place. It does look like Kate and Kami still check for any updates to this page though, so there is hope I am not the only one to ever read this.   I just got back from my 20 day trip to Australia and New Zealand with my girlfriend, Alisa, and her dad, Vance. We had a great time where we did all sorts of things; we went wine tasting, saw the blue mountains and the three sisters, drove on the wrong (well right for them... well, actually left for them...) side of the road, flew on lots of planes, took most every modern form of transportation, discovered lots of tasty local chocolates, went on a brewery tour and drank plenty of good NZ beer (and some so-so Australian beer), hiked on a glacier, took lots of pictures, relaxed on the beach, saw my first topless beach, petted a kangaroo, found out a dingo was really just a reddish looking dog, ate good food but stayed away from the 'roo or emu burgers, saw a sky full of unfamiliar stars, failed to notice which way the toilets flushed, due to the oddities of traveling over the international date line we lost June 24th 2004 forever but gained an extra July 12th (why did we have to choose gaining an extra Monday?), dived and snorkeled on the Great Barrier Reef, climbed a big rock called Uluru in the middle of the desert, went on lots of hikes, saw many amazing sites, read many Bill Bryson books, finally finished reading Richard Dawkin's  The Selfish Gene  (highly recommended), finally read  Flat Lander , and generally very much enjoyed myself.   Taking that long of a time away from work and my normal day to day life allowed for time to reflect on what I am doing and where I want to go with my life. In short, I pretty much figured out what I knew before the trip, I don't want to keep doing this job and I want to figure out what else to do. I didn't figure what else to do, but at least I have grown more comfortable with the idea of being ok with whatever comes after this. I don't expect to make a huge success of things with anything that come after this job as I once hoped to. I am more or less fine with doing whatever sounds remotely more satisfying or productive. I am still very much considering going back to school to get a Masters in physics or physical sciences, an MBA, or a Teacher's credential, but if those fall to the way side, I am sure something else will come up. I just hope this laissez faire attitude is able to beat back the day to day stresses of this job and researching other opportunities. That is the problem for me about discovering opportunities, it stresses me out. I always worry about the what-ifs and the opportunity costs and whatever... I am too good at cultivating the negative point-less-stresses. Sigh...   That was quite long... Surprised myself there I did. Speak like Yoda I sometimes do.    (I just used the spellchecker, and besides this blogger having the worst spell checker I have everused, I also noticed that it doesn't even recognize the word "blog".)

      I am in Boston (actually Walmath, but you probably didn't know where that was) for a month for work. While searching for my hotel (the streets here are horrendous) I was listening to a radio talk show on some AM station... The show was about lobsters, and fisherman's and scientist's discoveries about lobsters. During the show I realized what would be the perfect job for me; I should learn pointless useless facts and forget them again. I love doing that. Listening to random crap on the radio, or reading an obscure (but well written) book, or whatever... But then... This is key... I forget so much of what I learn. See, I learned all about lobster's sex life, scientist's recent methods of studying the lobsters, fisherman's method of tagging the lobsters, and a bunch of other facts that I can't tell you about because I have forgotten most of it. I somehow don't think this is going to be all that marketable... Ok, off to the internet to learn some more obscure and immediately forgotten trivia. Maybe I should spend more time thinking about my career goals too....
