      "...good always overpowered the evils of all mankind...but in time, our nations grew weak, and our cities fell to slums while evil stood strong."    This is my blog. It's name is "Option #3". If you have any questions about the name of the blog, please ask one Franklin of 3 Feet Deep about option number three, biotch.  Anyway, this is going to be where the random, late night rantings of yours trully come out. Of course, it will be nothing like a Scott Jennings, or an Arcadian Del Sol, because I'm not hip and/or smart like that, nor do I have enough drive.    My credentials: I have none, but my name is Erik, a pisces (which you all love, I know) and I work at Home Depot. Basically, I get paid to hang out with my buddies at work and listen to customers gripe, or listen to my managers make outrageous statements infront of customers. I think we'll end the entry this evening with one of those.  So I'm standing next to an assistant store manager, and I'm helping a customer. This really old man walks by with one hella hot girl on his arm, and the manager remarks something to the effect of "My God, how does a man that old get a woman like that? I tell you what, though, he must have a yard long cock or something." Classic.

      ...the Senoritas. Lame.    Getting ahead of myself. Anyway, first I visited Dave, my brother in law, who moved back into his home recently. Going over there Friday to help paint and introduce him and my sister to Kill Bill. Cat, Angela, and who knows who else got tickets to see Catch 22 and Reel Big Fish, so they totally broke the Monday tradition of fajeetas. Tom, however, made some bad ass steak, which was HOT. And by Hot I mean don't touch my plate or I'll growl at you. The movie wasn't quite Mexican...it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles...so if you imagine them with sombreros, you'll be ok. Also watched an animated short I got called the Cathedral, some badass CGI. Too bad it was only 8 minutes long.  Anywho, I have to get back to making sure the monkeys are getting along with making Cat's CD.

      "Were they psychos?" "No, they were not psychos, they were vampires. Psychos do not EXPLODE when sunlight hits them, I don't care how FUCKING crazy they are!"  Apparently last week Monday became Mexican Monday, which entails eating fa-jee-tas and watching a movie based in a Southernly direction.  This week we watched Dusk Til Dawn, a fantastic movie. Most of the people liked it...until the end. But that's what you get when you sit down to watch a VAMPIRE movie with QUENTIN TARRANTINO in it, ok? :p Tom is a good cook, and if he ever fails as a programmer, I'll hire him as my personal chef with Cat and the rest of the girls as my cabana girls. Nick and Frank can be my muscle, while Steve is the bartender...a la Isaac from Love Boat...except not so suave.  Anyway, it was a good night, though I was half asleep during most of it. And even if Cat couldn't expend the energy to come hug me, atleast Grace did. I love you Grace!  (Love you too Cat!)

      Went to the Orioles make up game against the Giants. Left at the end of the 10th. Shoulda stayed. Orioes won it in 11 on Bigbie's RBI single.  Poor Todd Linden, though, he started in left field instead of Bonds, and got heckled for NO reason. Section 80 and 82 (us) were giving this guy unending shit.  I know he went home to kick the dog. Just for fun, here are Linden's stats for the year:  YEAR 2004   G   8 	 AB   17	    R   5 H    3	    2B  1	 3B   0	    HR  0	 RBI  0	    BB  3	 SO   4 	    SB  0	 CS   0	    BA  .176 	 OBP .333    SLG .235  OPS .569  Forgiveable OBP, but everything else is trash.  Apparently this guy was a prospect at some point in time, but he's probably losing that status these days as he is pushing the age of 25.  Anyway, good seats, good company, good food. Good times.

      ...going to go on a rant here, but I'm going to keep it to myself this time. On a brighter note, some of the hackers who broke into Valve's PCs and stole the source code to Half Life 2 have been apprehended.  Hacking is no longer, even if it ever was, fighting the good fight against the conglomerates of the world. Sure, to be good at it, you need to be smart, but to be one at all, all you need is a script.  It's 3 a.m. and I'm much too tired to dive into another one of those Holier Than Thou speeches, so we can just leave it at this: Yay hacking for modding, boo hacking for hacking, it's like spraying graffiti on the walls.

      I could fall into this habit. Another sweet night, and a backrub to boot. Good pics, too. See you all again soon.

      I got home from work tonight to see the CallerID light flashing, which means there's a new number that's called the phone. It turns out it's a payphone from Washington DC. Who the hell is calling my house from DC...on a payphone? I stopped dealing drugs years ago, leave me alone, coke-heads!

      Nights like this make me regret never attending a full four year university and living on campus. I envy my friends Frank and Nick, cause it musta been good times while it lasted. (Who am I kidding, same thing goes on at their house, now.) Anyway, it's nice to live in that life every now and then, and without going into gruesome detail, it was a fucking great night, I even enjoyed Harry Potter. Thanks everyone.  I guess alcohol really does enhance everything, even Jenga.  On a futuristic note, tomorrow is Tabi's graduation (?)party, and it will be sweetness to see those two again. Nick's brothers + Tabi + all my other friends = gauranteed good times.  To. blave.   Oh, and yeah, screw you anonymous posters. Atleast sign that shit, bastids.

      Possibly going out to drink today with some friends from the Despot, should be amusing. Always is. Next week I will be in PA for a couple days to visit my friend B who I haven't seen since working at Apple, which is going to be money.  The Cat will be back sometime in the near future, and then in about a month my family from Germany is coming over. All in all, it's going to be an eventful month and a half from now on.      On a down note, I won't be able to go back to school until Spring so I will be considered "in county" for tuition purposes. Brrr Nrrr... Oh well.  That's all for now.

      Tonight made me realize how incredibly out of shape I am.  Sure, I lift every other day, but man, when I started running out on that soccer field, my legs went to jelly. Nothing feels better than the ache after a soccer game though, even if it makes you sick.  Tonight made me appreciate all the running I did through high school and college years, and how I could play an entire 60 minute soccer game without tiring. Those days are long gone. I better start running. Now for a hot bath.

      Sitting here bored. Got training in Waldorf for the next two days. Fuck that. Waldorf. Pssht. July 4th was friggin hilarious...  "They made you hang up clothes in a clothing store? Those BASTARDS!" All hail the little war game. Tom's sister is money, especially when drunk. Everyone wish Happy Birthday to my sister, Christine!  Went to play pool with Grace a couple days ago and ran into a guy I used to play soccer with, which was kinda money. Always like those random meetings with your past. Next time I crush Grace under the merciless power of my 8-ball skeelz.  Well, maybe, if Cat stops saying I'm good and stops jynxing me. Whatta ho.   Keep on shinin', bitches.

      ...sounds about like the options.  Some shindig tomorrow with Nick's coworkers. I won't know them, but hey, the Broads are showing up, so it will be acceptable...perhaps. Gots a call from Cat, which was hot, but not as hot as the IM conversation that followed. Let the evil plots commence. Plaid and handcuffs. to. blathe. Anyway. It's 1 am, and I've been up since 3 am, and Grace says I need my beauty sleep. (Ouch).
