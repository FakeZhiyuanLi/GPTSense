      Last night my one goal was to get so drunk I would stop thinking about Jamie and all of that drama.  I went to a local bar across the street (so I could walk home).  I was there maybe 30 minutes when guess who comes in?  Jamie.  I think we talked for a few minutes, but I got so drunk that I really don't remember anything else that happened.  Some how Imanaged to get home, and I threw up somewhere along the way.  But it worked, I forgot about my problems for awhile.  Today, I didn't even really think about Jamie at all.  Who says alcohol can't help you with your issues, at least temprorarily.  Went out to a Go Kart racing track today with some coworkers and had a blast.  Then I went to see "The Day After Tommorrow" and believe me, this movie sucked really bad.  Bad plot, bad dialogue, cheesy scenes.  The only saving grace was some of the special effects. Even still a careful eye picks out some major errors in the effects.  Hail is physically too large, metal doesn't become brittle in extreme cold, weather patterns are moving in the wrong direction.  The Statue of Liberty is backwards.  That kind of stuff.

      Ok this is my second shot at writing this, since the website didn't save my first post.  I am trying this, because I think it might be more convenient to me than handwriting my journal, of which I have several hundred pages already transcribed.  I'm 23 right now, 6'2 tall.  I'm in the military, what branch and what my specific job is is if no real importance right now.  Suffice to say my job requires me to be in excellent shape, more so than your "average" military man.  I have brown hair and eyes, and while don't look modelesque, I have been told I have that "boy next door" kind of cuteness.  Due tomy job, I move around quite frequently.  My current location has been my longest by far at around 1.5 years.  I'm due to leave here in a few months, but thats why I'm not depessed.  It's all because of a Girl (figures), a girl named Jamie.  Flashback about 8 months, and a guy I know was dating some girl named Jamie.  He was sleeping around with a lot of other women, this I knew, but I doubt Jamie knew that.  We all went down to the city, and Jamie was the desginated driver.  As such I had her number to call, if the group got seperated.  It was a fun night, I talked to Jamie a bit, but nothing major.  I was more interested in finding a nice girl for a quick anonymous fling.    About four months later, My friend has transferred (although I did not know it at the time, pretty much blew off Jamie, promising to call and write and never did).    I was cleaning out my phone diretory when I came across Jamie's number.  Without much thought (I had not talked to her except for that one night) I deleted it. Three hours later, she called me, asked if I was still in the area, and asked me out to a bar with some of her friends.  If I received this call a week earlier or later, I would have probably declined.  I was a busy person with a lot of fun things planned for weekends.  AS it happened this weekend, most of my friends were outta town, so I accepted her invitation.  A fun time was had, but I really had little interest in Jamie.  She is not really my type at all.  She has blondish hair, dark eyes and is a little bigger than my average woman.  She is not fat, but any imagination, but more curvy than I am used to.  Following that night, she called me several more times, having short and sweet conversations.  We went out to another bar, just the two of us and had a decent time.  A few more trips out with friends ensued.  One night she invited me up to her house.  She had a girlfriend over and they asked me to come up.  I obliged and we had a fun time.  Jumping on a trampoline, having a few beers, teasing her younger siblings.  It was at this time I realized that Jamie has an interest in me.  It was here that she started leaning up close to me, finding a reason to touch me.  Then while we were outside she surprised me by leaning in and kissed me.  I probably was a crappy kisser because to be quite honest, it surprised the hell out of me.  Soon after I left that night, I began to consider that I might actually like this girl.  Perhaps even though she was far outside of my "type" both physically and personality wise, we were still a match.  Over the next few weeks and months I realized I really did like Jamie a lot.  Her personality, her laugh, even her appearance excited me.  I was falling for her.  All of our meetings ended with kissing, some more passionate than others, but never progressed beyond that point.  I was going to force the issue, and it seemed neither was she.    LAtely however (over the last 2-3 weeks) I sensed a rather dramatic shift in her.  She wasn't always the Jamie I was falling for, sometimes she would be quiet, indifferent and tended to ignore me.  What had been 3 or 4 calls a week turned into 1 or even none as she would ignore my messages.  She would only call when she wanted to go out, but politely decline anytime I tried to initate anything.   I realized how much I like Jamie, her friends, even her family.  Her mother remarked once to her "Jamie I haven't seen Mike for a few days, He is a good guy, the kind of guy you should date."  I knew that I was going to be transferring soon.  I also knew that this was one girl who I cared enough about to try to make it work after I transferred.  I would be gone 6-9 months then hopefully back into the area.  Even if I didn't come back to the area, I would still be a short flight away and be able to come bakc every other weekend or so.  It would be hard, but I'd be willing to do it.  Finally I had to approach Jamie, and one night While kissing (both of us slightly intoxicated, not drunk, but buzzing, I asked "Are wer just friends or more than that?  I know I want more, but I need to know where your feelings lie."  She told me it was complicated, and she would call me later that night to explain everything.  Then kissed me again and drove off home.  I never received a call that night, or for the following two nights.  I wanted to discuss this in person, so avoided bringing it up on the two occasions we talked after that.  SHe however manuevered around us meeting face to face.  SHe then sent me a TEXT MESSAGE saying "I'm not really looking for a boyfriend, I just got out of a relationship a few months ago."  I was hurt to say the least, but I suppose I could understand where she was coming from considering I knew her last boyfriend, and how messy it ended.    3 days ago, she called me and asked me to a softball game with her friend and her friend's boyfriend.  I went, but she was distant the whole night.  I finaly got her alone to talk, and while I was trying to explain my position, to see what the extent of our realtionship was, all she could muster were a few grunts, uh-uhs and yes and no.  That hardly makes a conversation.  She left that night (the first time in 3 months we parted without at least a simple kiss) and have not heard from her since.  I left a message on her voicemail, but probably won't follow up onit, because I am not some annoying stalker that is going to harrass a women.  Instead I wonder about what went wrong, and how much alcohol it is going to take to kill the pain I am feeling.  Most guys wouldn't even worry about it.  THe rational mind says, Hey mike, your leaving in 2 months you can find a lot of girls at your next station.  The thing is this.  In my time in the military and my time in college, I had a lot of those one night stands, those quick flings.  I have grown tired of them.  I like relationships, I love having a girlfriend.  The only problem is there are very few women I want to have these relationships with, so when I find one, like with Jamie I am so happy, only to be crushed when it doesn't work out.  In retrospect there are probably two reasons why things ended the way they did.  First, she was so hurt by the failure of the first relationship where the guy cheated, ditched her and transferred never to be heard from, that she preemptivly ended things with me.  SHe did this for fear it might happen again, even though if she knew me at all, she would know I would never do something like that.  Or she was teasing all along.  She never really had any true feelings for me, just like kissing and being close to a guy, but when she realized I had feelings, she ended it, or she ended it because she found another target, or she was bored.    I guess I kind of prefer the first option, becasue that leaves open the possibility of her realizing her mistake and calling me.  The sad part is, even though she has hurt me, if she calls I will probably go back.  AHHH the bane of the nice guy.  Oh well, I think the only cure for this is alcohol and lots of meaningless sex with random hot bar chicks.  It won't mean anythingm but maybe it will get my mind off of Jamie for a few minutes, or perhaps not.

      Just got a call while I was at work.  I wished I got it later so I could talk longer, but it was from some girl, Heather, that I knew about a year ago.  She was pretty cute, and we hooked up a few times, but I went on leave and when I cam back she had turned into a base wide trick.  SHe called asked how I was, and kinda implied that it would be nice to get together again.  Not something I might normally do, but I will be passing through her area in August, and as I recall she was a demon in bed.  Since I got nothing to tie me down after the Jamie debacle, I might just take her up on the offer.
