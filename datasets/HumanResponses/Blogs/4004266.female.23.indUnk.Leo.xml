						    I started a blog on society and "progress", but that will have to wait a few days. Instead, it's going to be a quiet blog today... all about nothing. Sad, isn't it?    &nbsp;  But then again, today was a pretty productive day, I must admit. I probably should do more of this. It's sad... the day that I'm the most productive is also the day that I stay the latest.    &nbsp;  It's a beautiful 29 degrees outside, and I can't wait to enjoy the rest of the afternoon.    &nbsp;  Sorry :)

						     I read somewhere that people are now trying to design offices so that people would walk more... such as putting meeting rooms and cafeterias on opposite ends of buildings to encourage people to walk to those places. All of this is an attempt to make people more active. I'm not really sure how active walking a few hundred feet (at most) would make people more fit.     The article also talks about encouraging gym memberships and putting gyms inside the office buildings. Would this really work? On one hand, having a gym nearby may entice people to go and join it. On the other hand, there's nothing sillier than seeing a person run in place for an hour. No... not true. What is sillier is to see a roomful of people running in place for an hour.    Why do companies do this? Do you think it is because they care about their employees' well-being? Hardly. More fit employees are more productive employees. More productive employees mean (hopefully) more profits for the company. All this just makes personal time really rare.    Because of this, I have a proposal for creating a more active environment. (Of course it can't be serious... but maybe, just maybe, we should give it a try! At least the first point... it actually seems feasible. At least according to me.)      Force people not to drive to work   This&nbsp;would reduce air pollution, therefore making our respiratory systems healthier to begin with. This would also keep people healthy because they would do a lot more walking than just a paltry walk to the faraway bathroom/cafeteria/meeting room.   We could implement this by banning cars altogether. That would make the auto industry mad, but who needs them anyway? Those that had jobs there could do something else, maybe design and manufacture better and more efficient buses/trains/bikes, etc. because we would need a better transit system now that nobody has cars. I'm open to suggestions.      Cut off electricity to the office building   If people want to use their computer, they could just sit on a stationary bike that generates electricity when you use it. Think of the Tour de France trainee in "The Triplets of Belleville". He powers his mother's gramophone (?) by cycling. We just need to design better stationary bikes. Hey, maybe those in the auto industry could get started on this!&nbsp;You don't even need heat then, because people would generate so much heat by making the whole building into one large fitness facility. This way, you can get fit while working! Companies don't have to give their employees fitness benefits anymore, people have more personal time because they don't need to go to the gym anymore, and companies save money because they don't need electricity or heat anymore! Then we would not get blackouts either because there's enough electricity to go around. How great would that be?     Or perhaps we should all just go back to the pre-Industrial Revolution&nbsp;where life was a lot more active, and work didn't mean sitting on your butt doing the same thing over and over again. Cynical? Probably. We would lose a lot of the productivity that we have now, but who said that now was better? Is progress as we know it really a good thing? I'll probably ramble on that point sometime later...

						     Today marks the second day in a row that I've gotten up before seven in the morning. All right... before eight in the morning. 6:20, to be precise,&nbsp;right before&nbsp;my mother called, probably to make sure I hadn't died in the night.     &nbsp;   Having breakfast while watching the morning news is not something I have done before.     &nbsp;   Getting to work before eight is strange too, because this building is absolutely deserted, save for a girl putting up signs for a conference and the dining services truck stopping to drop off today's supply of croissants and other breakfast goodies.     &nbsp;   Here are some benefits:       I can surf in peace and take care of all personal things without people constantly looking in the window to see whether I am working or not.    I can take long lunch breaks  and  still manage to leave at a reasonable time.    It is quiet so I can also work in peace. Well, it's quiet most of the day, but there is nobody here to bother you in the mornings with email and other such nonsense as well.    It's a nice and cool drive to work. The sun hasn't quite come up completely yet, so the air's got that crisp feeling that's associated with early mornings (and getting lots done, in my opinion).    There is nothing to do in the evenings, so I might as well go to sleep. And what am I going to do with all that sleep?     I am not advocating that everyone should get up early. It does cut into late-night fun. Except I don't get that aspect of life at the moment... so I can go to bed early, and&nbsp;therefore get up early. However, I am not usually a morning person. My university sleeping schedule varied, but (barring early morning classes... sometimes) it usually ranged from bedtime at one or two in the morning and getting up at ten or eleven in the morning. Move everything one or two hours later once in a while. But if I do this with work, I won't arrive until noon-ish, and can't leave until everyone else has been long gone.    So this morning, what have I done? Well, after forty-five minutes, I got a drink, read the news,&nbsp;and made two phone calls.    Oh... and I wrote today's entry!

						     I have made three attempts to write something today, but all to no avail. Perhaps I am having too much of a bad day to get anything coherent and relatively meaningful out. Meaningful? Well, at least not completely meaningless.      As for why I am having a bad day:  1) I swiped my mom's car against the wall yesterday in an attempt to park at my really small parking spot between a wall and another car that parked OVER the line.  2) The gym was so packed this morning that I had to leave (and have full intention of returning there tonight).  3) I got to work too early (because I couldn't go to the gym) and consequently am very bored.    In contrast, I had a good weekend. It was semi-productive. My relatives came over on Saturday (my sister and I met them at the mall cooling off from the heat wave). I started to catalogue my pictures. I learned half of a song on the guitar. Therefore I was happy.    All right... perhaps this post was meaningless after all. I apologize. Perhaps I will be in a better writing mood tomorrow.

						     I am in the middle of a heat wave right now. Temperatures are going up to the mid- to high- 30's today (Celsius). That's hot for a place where the average July temperatures are 13-24 degrees. Because of that, I am thinking about air conditioning. Not as something I would get, but something that inevitably crosses your mind while you sit in your living room with all the windows open and the lights out at 11:00 pm, hoping for cool air to blow in and drive all the hot hot hot air away. And since relief does not come, you wonder how you are supposed to sleep.     &nbsp;   Back to air conditioning.   I think that we are on our way to self-destruction. As I sit in my air-conditioned workplace today, I can't help but think that&nbsp;many buildings in this town, then this country, and in a lot of other countries all have air-conditioning. Add to that many homes and cars that have air-conditioning too.     &nbsp;   It's all very well and nice that we are now much more comfortable in the summer... no more sweltering heat, no more flies buzzing around, and when you go outside, you are made even happier in one of two ways:    1) What a nice warm day. Nice change from my freezing cold house/car/office/school.    2) Oh, I'm so glad I have air-conditioning. Otherwise, I would die in this heat!     &nbsp;   I saw a movie recently which had a line that went something like, "Freon is going to change the world." It has. It has enabled us to be more productive, so now that they can do work on hot, lazy afternoons. But along with that is how we've helped change our environment... and for the worse.           Freon is a CFC, a chemical that depletes ozone.   We're worried that Australia and Antarctica have ozone holes over them. We're worried about skin cancer because of UV rays. We talk about research to try to fix the holes. We talk about how UV rays are killing coral reefs, trees, etc.   On the flip side, some people argue that  a)    the idea of ozone depletion is a myth, that CFC's don't seem to cause damage at all, and it is just environmentalists crying wolf.  b) ozone depletion does not mean increased UV, or  c) CFC's don't cause much damage compared to volcanoes and other such natural occurences.      Now:      a) If there was no ozone depletion, there would not be holes in different places where there were none previously. Measurements in the 1950s showed no holes, before air conditioning became widespread. As for environmentalists, that's a lot of wasted time and effort by a lot of people if it wasn't true (granted, that last sentence isn't much of an argument... call it a comment).   b) Check out the US EPA site on ozone depletion and UV (  urlLink  http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/effects.html   ). Check out the effects of increased UV on us (  urlLink  http://www.epa.gov/sunwise/uvandhealth.html   ).   c) If we only used CFCs as often as volcanic eruptions happen, then sure, they wouldn't cause as much damage as volcanoes. But since we use it  every single day  (especially in warm climates and/or in the summers), that's got to have an effect on ozone depletion.         Turning on air conditioning consumes power, and that contributes to lots of problems.   Where do we get power? Pick your favorite form of energy generation... chances are, most of the energy consumed by the average person every day consists of burning some sort of fossil fuel. Yes, there is renewable energy available, such as hydroelectricity, solar energy, etc, but how much electricity does that produce? Certainly not enough to feed our power-hungry selves. So we still burn gas, oil, etc.   (On a side note, the use of renewable energy isn't at all great either. Take hydroelectricity for example. On one hand, it's better than some other forms of energy because it is renewable. On the other hand, building dams and such can be detremental to the environment. You have to flood a large area and create a lake. That's not necessarily good for the area - you're change the habitat!&nbsp;It also makes it harder for fishes and other river creatures to get around this dam. An example is salmon that have to swim upriver. By having a dam there, you block them from being able to go upstream. Fish ladders help, but how many dams can you say have fish ladders that provide as easy access through it as if there wasn't a dam at all?)   When we turn on an air conditioner at home or at work, we use electricity. When we turn on the air conditioner in the car, we make it work harder. All of this generates heat, CO2, or both, not to mention funny chemicals that cause funny environmental effects such as smog and acid rain. The extra heat, CO2 and other stuff help with the whole idea of the greenhouse effect as well.      Do we really need air conditioning?      At Work/School/Whatever  Perhaps we should take the attitude of the Spanish - the siesta. This way, everyone goes home during the heat of the day and naps/eats/whatever. After it gets cool enough again, they go back to work. Does this take away from a work/home balance? Not really. If everyone goes home at that time, the whole family can spend quality time together. Having the siesta will also promote living CLOSE to where you go to school, work or whatever you do during the day. That cuts down on commute time, traffic, pollution (hey - the less time you spend in the car, the less you pollute!). So that should take care of having air conditioning at work. The only case I see that it is necessary to have air conditioning is a room full of temperature-sensitive machines where you need to control the environment or something catastrophic occurs.    At Home  Well, maybe people should consider not living in the city so much. Cities usually have a microclimate where temperatures are a few degrees warmer than in the country. Trees also usually provide shade... that helps with the temperature problem too! Perhaps people should also think of leaving the lights off unless necessary (that would help with energy consumption as well), drink water, etc. Perhaps the reason people think they cannot live without air conditioning is because they are so used to it that they make it a big deal if they don't have it. Everyone before the advent of air conditioning managed to get through their life without it. Perhaps air conditioning should only be available to seniors or those who are susceptible to heat stroke.    Cars  Turn on your vents all the way up!     Of course, this would only work in an idealized world, and only because most won't listen to this. There's a lot of things in my idealized world that probably would supposedly not make any sense in the real world, but it can't hurt to think about it, can it?    Feel free to discuss :)

						    My tBlog account expired a couple of months ago, because I didn't post or log in often enough for their liking. But Blogger has let me sign up for a blog, so I'm now on Blogger. (The reason I signed up for tBlog was because Blogger wouldn't let me. I'm not sure why...)     &nbsp;   So I'm back at work, wondering what to do during lunch hours, or after hours, or before hours... even during hours. It's lunch time right now, and I didn't really feel like heading down to the cafeteria. So I've decided to restart my blog, with the hopes of actually keeping up with it.     &nbsp;   Hopefully there will be enough interesting things to talk about in my life in the next while. Otherwise, there won't be very many posts. I will apologize for that in advance.     &nbsp;   That said, I'm done for the day.

						    Friday was a very "accidental" day. I started off the day reinstalling my computer, which I started on Thursday... but trying to sync my code to the "master copy" didn't work. Therefore, I became really annoyed and deleted everything to start anew.      Unfortunately, I had forgotten that I had saved ALL of my work in that folder I just deleted. So I lost everything I did that week.      If it wasn't for the fact that it's a bit of a pain to redo, it's actually quite funny.      Nothing of note really happened on Friday. Unfortunately.
