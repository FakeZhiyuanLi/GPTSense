      My resume is in the mail to IDEO!! :)  Just barely though...I called the post office and they said that they would be open until 5:30 and I get there at 3:05 and they are closing.  But I'm like, "I really want to get this mailed today" and the guy let me get in line :)  Maybe he thought it was a college application or something, but regardless, he let me mail it!  So now I wait...and wait...and hope :)  Have a Happy New Year everyone!!

      Not much new here.  I've been working on my resume and cover letter for IDEO.  Hopefully I'll get that off sometime this week.  I'm really excited about the possibilities of working for a place like that.  It's too bad that they're not really hiring right now.  Still, I think I have a pretty good shot with a lot of the experience I have from my masters thesis and working at Motorola this year.  We'll see how it goes.  I had a good conversation at lunch today with another friend from work that just confirmed again that I really do need to get away from Motorola.  There's just so much wrong with the labs there right now, and no hope of getting better anytime soon.  So we'll see where this next year takes me!

      Merry Christmas everyone!!  I had a great Christmas up with my family and got a nice pair of vegan shoes - Now everyone keeps asking, "What's so un-vegan about shoes?"  Well, vegan shoes have no leather or animal-made glues.  They're really nice :)  And I got to see a bunch of relatives too, so that's always fun!    Pictures of the un-turkey are coming soon, but they're on my cousin's camera because mine is currently broken :(  I hope everyone had a great Christmas!!

      So there's  urlLink Mad Cow  in the states now.  Makes me glad to not have eaten any meat in the last two years.  Speaking of which, for all of you who joined me on my Tofurky adventure at Thanksgiving, for Christmas it's going to be the "un-Turkey."  Before you laugh, check out the  urlLink box .

      So today was a good day.  I talked to a lot of people about the idea of moving to CA, and got a lot of good responses.  All were in favor of me moving as long as I came back for Cubs games :)  On a more serious side though, I met someone at the MIT Chicago Holiday Party that has a connection at IDEO Palo Alto, so maybe this little dream can really become a reality.  We'll see!  Seeing a bunch of current students and new admits made me really miss the environment of MIT though.  All the more reason to head out west!  It didn't give me much hope that all the non-finance, non-architect people at the party all said that chicago is not the place for anyone who wants a challenging tech job with a ton of other highly motivated great engineers...a friend from work told me the same thing today as well.  Too bad I didn't know that a year ago!!  A final note:  It's 3 days until Christmas!!  I hope everyone reading this has a safe travel where ever they are going! :)

      So here's my first "real" blog post.  I've been reading  urlLink The Art of Innovation  which is basically a book on how  urlLink IDEO  works.  If you haven't heard of them, they're this big design firm that started in Palo Alto - follow the link.  Anyway, it's leading me to realize how much my job at Motorola really isn't what I want to be doing.  Although they aspire to some of these IDEO innovation ideals, it's no where near what IDEO, and countless other Silicon Valley companies, are doing every single day.  So I got this whole "moving to CA" idea about a month ago when Moto sent me out to Mountain View to transfer some code.  I just really saw how great (both technically and as really nice people) everyone out there was.  It was a feeling I don't get in Chicago.  Especially the technical greatness.  It's something I miss a lot about MIT and something that I really want back.  And from what I've seen in the labs at Motorola, it's not something I'm going to find there.  And man, you can't beat the selection of veggie restaurants in the bay area, something Chicago is painfully lacking in :)  So anyway, I'm going to get back to this IDEO book and see what else they have to say.  In the mean time...CA, yea or nay?

      Hey!  Welcome to my blog!  :)  We'll see what this turns into, but for now, I'll just say that you can expect to find some links, random musings, maybe some poetry, and random info about what I'm up to.  Feel free to comment!

      Wow...the demo at work is all done!  And we actually got it to work!!! And work well :)  So that was a happy end to the week! :)  And even the CTO thought it was "wonderful."  Too bad I've been so busy working on this demo that I'm totally not ready to go to California on Sunday!!  Guess that means I'm working again tomorrow.  But man, it was awesome to get that demo working today.  Made all that work pay off.  And CA will be awesome as always.  Hopefully I'll have some free time to head up to Muir woods and see some redwoods and just go hiking a little bit.  It'll be great for it to be warmer than -20 ;)  Not much else is going on here.  Hopefully after I get back from CA things will slow down a little and I'll have some more free time.  If anyone has ideas of really nice Boston restaurants or knows of anything interesting going on there the week after valentines day, let me know!!  Have a great weekend everyone!!!

      Hi all!  Yes, it's just about midnight, and yes, I just got back from work.  Nothing like a good 15 hour day :)  We found out that in the end, we couldn't get our demo finished because of a piece of beta version 1 software running on our machine that we had to work with but was full of bugs.  A bummer, but at least we can still do our demo in a different way :)  But you know, little things like that cannot possibly get me down today! :)  I just made plans to be out in boston for valentine's day - well, not exactly on that day for a variety of scheduling reasons, but "for" valentine's day for sure.  But who might I be seeing in Boston for such a day?  Good question :)  Some of you know :)  Others might be able to guess :) :)  Anyway, I am super super super excited about this :) :) :)

      It's been a crazy busy week so far at work.  That's honestly all I've been up to!  But our demo is almost all working.  So there's not much to say here...other than that I'm really looking forward to going to San Francisco and getting out of the snow for a little while.  And a big thanks to Prashant for staying at work and hacking code with me when he totally didn't have to.  You rock!

      I have a new  urlLink phone !!! :)  No thanks to Amazon.com though!  They finally told me that it would take another month to ship my phone, so I just walked into a T-Mobile store and walked out with one for like $30 more.  But it was worth not dealing with Amazon any more :)  And man, this phone rocks :) :)  Not much else new here...spent the weekend working and doing FIRST, I know, very exciting :)  All this work is reminding me of MIT, which is exactly what I needed right now.  It's wonderful to be so busy, and busy doing things that are cool and exciting! :)  And it's awesome to be working with high school students from my old high school!!!  If anyone of my friends in San Francisco are reading this and are doing something fun for superbowl, let me know!! I'll be out there that day (and the rest of that week).  Maybe we can hit up Naan and Curry again sometime - or another good veggie place!! :)

      Hi everyone!  Sorry I haven't been blogging much, but it's been another super crazy busy week with FIRST and work.  But things are going really well here!!  We had out IAP Pub Night in Chicago on Tuesday and 30 people came!!  That was exciting, because I haven't been able to get that many people to a happy hour yet this year. :)  And Stacie came down from Wisconsin - ;) - so it was fun to get to hang out with her!!  And I found out that I won't get to be in SF for six weeks, but for one week in february and two weeks in march.  Anyone who will be out in the bay area for the first week of February that wants to hang out, let me know!!  So I'm on this IDEO/Motorola committee - yeah, ironic, don't you think :)  Anyway, it's going really well, and after today's meeting I'm actually really proud to be working for Motorola.  There's a lot of cool stuff in our future if we listen to these guys!!  And I get a little tour of IDEO SF when I'm out there in a few weeks!!  And FIRST is going really well too!  Raul and Miten are CADing away and we should be starting on a prototype soon :)  Other than that, I've just been thinking a lot about what I want to be doing for the next few years. The more I'm involved with Moto people outside my lab, I realize that it's a pretty cool place that can do some pretty cool things.  And this Moto/IDEO thing has really made me realize that we have some great people in the labs and in the company.  So I think I'm applying for this masters thing at northwestern and seeing if I can get Moto to cover any of it.  It would be fun to stay around Chicago too :)  But who knows...if I get into IDEO, I just may change my mind!!  A final note, anyone who has ever ordered from Amazon and wished that they could actually speak to a PERSON, here is their hidden number...  1-800-201-7575

      Yesterday was a ton of fun! :)  After FIRST, my friend Stacie and I went to dinner with a friend that was in from Boston that I used to live with at Student House!! It was a great time, and we went to PF Changs!! :)  One of my favorites for sure!!  Especially the lettuce wraps! :)  Today was another long day of work, and then about four hours of FIRST.  So now I'm exhausted and am probably going to head off to bed soon.  The robot is coming along nicely and the high school students are getting a lot more involved, so I'm happy :)

      Hey everyone!  If you've never gone to see "Too Much Light Makes the Baby Go Blind" you totally should!!  It's a play by the  urlLink neo-futurists  - well, it's actually 30 plays in 60 minutes and if it sells out you get free pizza :)  And believe me, it *will* sell out...long before the doors open!  Anyway, it comes very highly reccomended...almost as much as chocolate vegan milkshakes at Pick Me Up cafe.  It's been a good night :)

      Two posts today!  Man...see what happens when I take a day off from FIRST! :)  Anyway, the Don Norman thing was cool and got me thinking a lot about big companies and design.  He made one offhanded comment about big companies never being able to do "great" design.  His point was that the traditional "user-centered design" focuses a lot on usability and solving common needs and problems - and he said that this makes for pretty "good" products for the masses.  But the "great" design - the stuff that makes people go wow and reflect on their experience with a product comes from creating emotional reactions...which is a risky business, and with so many different people that react to things so differently, a big company can't risk doing a lot of this emotional design for a large-audience product.  I just thought that was a really interesting way to look at things.  I mean just look at apple or bose or rolex or any other "well-designed" product.  They appeal to a very limited market share for the most part (partly because of price, but partly because of how they are "different").  He also talked a lot about cell phones.  Which was cool, well, because that's what I do now :)  He talked about personalization in phones and how that would be how a company like Motorola would really get great design...in allowing for different experiences and customizable looks for phones.  He mentioned this phone we have in Korea marketed towards teenage girls...it lets people hang little trinkets off of it all over the place and looks very "teenage girl" :)  Interesting to think about as we design a lot of "all-purpose" phones and applications.  OK..enough about the talk!  Laura came up from KY early so she could hear the talk, so it was cool to get to hang out with her again tonight!  And especially cool since we're beyond the weirdness in hanging out stage.  She's up to check out this new design program at Northwestern.  This weekend will be all FIRST FIRST FIRST...should be fun though!  And I get to hang out with an old friend from student house on sunday with my friend stacie!  That should rock :)

      My MIT email account (and athena account) are now dead :(  It's a sad day and a total reminder that I'm in the "real world" now!  So use my alum address if you want to email me, since I'll have that forever!    It's been a super-busy week with FIRST, but we're getting some great ideas for the robot, so I'm really excited.  It's fun to lead some strategy sessions again :)    If anyone is interested, Don Norman is giving a talk at the Evanston Library tonight at 7pm.  It should be really interesting!!!

      FIRST is here!! :)  The game is great this year and has so many components of past games, but a lot that's new.  Like a bar 10 feet in the air to hang on!!  It's cool to be back on my high school team though, with a bunch of the same old engineers and a bunch of my friends from high school now as motorola mentors :)  It should be a fun season as long as I don't get whisked off to CA before it's over!!  I went to a fun housewarming party at a friend's house yesterday!!  It was great to hang out with her and her friends and she cooked some awesome vegan lasagna!!  The kind I make myself :)  Other than that, it's been all FIRST all the time, which is what it's going to be for the next 6 1/2 weeks!!  But FIRST season is always fun!

      Hey!  :)  Not a ton new here.  But after all this time I am proud to say that I finally got over Laura today.  It was weird, we had this really long conversation and it just was so clear to both of us that there is never a chance for anything more than friendship between us.  And we were just both at total peace with that idea.  So yeah, life is good, life is free.  Sarah, I now know how you feel :)  In other news, the FIRST kickoff is tomorrow down at IIT!! I'm so excited to be mentoring my old high school team!  It'll be a good time for sure!!  Have a great weekend everyone!!

      So I found out today that I might get to go to San Francisco for a month and a half this year!  For all of February and 1/2 of March!! :)  I'm soooo excited!  It'll be a great chance to just live out there for a little bit and see if I really like the area as much as I did during that week I was out there last month!  It should be a really fun time!  Other than that, not much news around here.  Have a great weekend everyone!!!

      It's freezing cold here!!  Well, way below that actually! With a -20 windchill (yeah, that's a minus) this morning and still a -7 windchill now it's just nasty outside.  So of course what do I do, take a look at the forecast for San Francisco where it's going to be in the 60s this week.  Man, it's sure nice out there.    I've been debating what I want to do these next few years.  Of course it'll depend on the whole IDEO thing, but if I don't get into the CA office, maybe going to grad school part time at Northwestern might be a good idea.  They have this new masters program in Product Design and Development that is a lot like what I want to do...and they have Don Norman, who is pretty cool in the design world.  Anyway, we'll see what IDEO has to say in the next few weeks!  San Francisco still would be awesome!   Especially working for them! :)  Stay warm everyone!!!!

      Hey everyone!  And Happy New Year!!  I don't really know what to write right now.  A lot is going on, but that's about all I'll say about that right now.  It's long and complicated, so if you know me really well, just ask.  I'm really excited about this weekend though!  A good friend of mine from debate in high school is coming over tonight and we're going to cook up a vegan feast :)  Well, enough food for the two of us, but hey, it's still a feast.  And tomorrow I'm heading to this play with a FIRIST friend who is down from Milwaukee.  Her friend designs costumes and always has a bunch of free tickets to things.  It's great!  It's so good to have a busy weekend!!

      Yes, I know it's been forever since I've posted, but it's been an insanely busy month!!  But we shipped the robot for FIRST!!! :) :)  I'd put a picture up, but the design is still semi-confidential until we publicly release some pictures, so it'll have to wait a few days!  But I must say it's a pretty impressive design even if it is a little flimsy if hit the wrong way.  It should be a fun season of competitions this year!!  Speaking of which, I'm missing the first 2 days of Detroit :(  I'll be out in San Francisco again for the next two weeks so I won't be able to get out there until Saturday!!  But my friend Susan and I are taking a little road trip out there at 4am, so it'll be all good!  For those of you in chicago, come out for the regional at Northwester on the 26th or 27th of March!! It should be a good time, and we'll have had some practice in Detroit, so we should be pretty good by then!!  Other than FIRST, I have just been working a TON lately!!  I've got a bunch of different projects that I'm working on and even had more goals than our little performance management system could handle for the year, so it looks like those problems of being bored at work won't be coming back any time soon!!  And I just found out last week that I'm getting a promotion!!! So I'm super excited about that as well!!! :)  Oh!!! And I bought an iPod yesterday before heading over to the WildStang ship party at dan's.  It is the coolest thing ever!!  I got one of the mini ones and it's so great to go running with.  It comes with this arm band that makes it really easy to change songs or adjust the volume while you're running.  And of course it uses metadata and searching, so obviously I'm interested from a geeky point of view as well :)  It was almost 60 degrees outside today so I got my first outdoor run of the year in which was so great!  I really love evanston and being able to run along the lakefront with the city in the background and nothing but water to my left.   Well, that's about all that's new around here!!  I'm off to San Francisco for another two weeks and will be visiting my aunt and cousins down in LA next weekend.  So if any of you are there, you should let me know so we can hang out!! :)

      Hi!!  I'm actually home at a reasonable hour tonight!!  What a first! :)  And I got to go to FIRST today!  It was great to get to go after about two weeks away.  Not a lot else is new around here.  I was at work until after 1am on Monday, but these next few weeks should be a lot nicer!  All my code is checked in and everyone is happy with it. :)  Last night was fun too!  I hung out with some people that I worked with last year down in the city at this pretty cool bar in the south loop.  It was nice to have an evening to relax and get out!  And we also found out that there's a class project at Berkeley that is almost exactly like what we've been up to this year at work! :(  Oh well.  I guess it goes to show that we were thinking about the right things!  But the class was partly sponsored by Nokia, our biggest competitor! :(

      So I'm safely home from San Francisco!  It was an amazing weekend and I was able to go hiking up in the mountains and watch the sunset from a rock in the ocean and ride a cable car hanging onto the outside! :)  And that was all yesterday!  It was definitely a great ending to a very busy week!  The next few days should be pretty busy as well, but then hopefully it'll get a little bit less hectic after that. :)  I really love the bay area! (As if you guys didn't know that already!)  It's just amazing how nice the people are over there and just how friendly and environmentally aware and just overall laid back and accepting everyone is out there.  And you've just gotta love when you can go hiking in february in a sweatshirt! :)  It looks like we're going to have to put off that Too Much Light trip until next week or so.  I'm going out to dinner with my parents on Friday for my mom's birthday.  How about a week from Friday?  Does that work for people?  Let me know!

      Howdy from beautiful Mountain View, California :)  It's so wonderful to  be ou here!! The weather is amazing and the people are just so wonderful!  Everytime I come out here, I can't believe how amazingly nice everyone is.  I mean, I'm from the Midwest where people are supposed to be really nice...and I come out here and it's a world of difference.  Seriously...I mean I held the door open for these two people at PF Chang's (mmmm...lettuce wraps!) tonight and they were like...Oh, thank you so very much! Woah...for holding open a door for 5 seconds.  And I got into this whole long conversation with the checkout girl at whole foods.  It was very cool.  Anyway, I've got a TON of work to do tonight and just spent a long time talking to a friend on the phone, so I've gotta run and do work.  I hope everyone is having a good week!!  Oh, and if you're around Chicago and want to see Too Much Light Makes the Baby go Blind on February 13th (yes, it's a Friday) let me know!  I think I'm getting a bunch of people together for it!!

      FIRST was excellent as always!! :)  Although this time the standings didn't really show our true talent.  We ended up in 30th place after the seeding matches after a couple tough losses.  But we were also up against some of the best teams, so it was ok.  But we were picked by the #3 team as an alliance partner, so we made it into the tournament, losing in the semi-finals (making us #3 overall).  We had some tough breaks with the robot and trying to hang, but overall we learned a whole lot and are totally ready for the nationals next month!! :)  Not a whole lot else new around here.  I went to dinner with my parents after FIRST today and mentioned Ethel enough that they probably have figured out what's going on :)  They are very indirect people. It's bizarre.  Anyway...it was fun to have dinner with them :)  I think I'm ready for a nice quiet evening in after a crazy busy few days at FIRST.  Time to make some nice hot tea and read a book I think.  Enjoy the rest of the weekend everyone!! :)

      Yesterday was AMAZING :)  I'm so serious that it was like the best day ever!! :) :)  Ethel and I went to the Milwaukee Art Museum and saw the "wings" open and close...went all over the museum..laughed, smiled, held each other's hands, walked along the lake in the nice spring weather.  Man...I couldn't imagine a more beautiful and amazing day.  Things are definitely going well!!  Oh!!!  And Toys R Us is now selling atari in a box...like all the old games bundled in a little joystick that you plug into your TV!  It's awesome :)  Ethel and I were playing pac man in the store.  Yes, we went to a toys r us.  And yes, I'm 24 and she's 23 :)  And yes, we had SO much fun :)  So Ethel gets to open up the Wisconsin State Fair!  How cool is that??  And she's like in a parade on the 4th of july!  Man, the life of a beauty queen ;)  Of course that means that she'll be back in WI a lot, which makes me happy :) :) :)  I'm just very happy right now, if you couldn't tell :) :)  FIRST is this weekend!  If you are in or near Chicago, you should totally come!!  It's at the Northwestern Basketball Staduim right on Central all day Friday and Saturday!!  But if you come saturday, come early, cause it's eliminations in the afternoon and you never know how far we'll make it!  It should be an awesome competition though and we should do really well!  Our drivers have been practicing a lot and we finally have autonomous mode working :)  Have a great weekend everyone!! :) :)

But it's actually been a super-fun week as opposed to all those super-busy-with-work weeks :)  So I flew home from San Francisco last Friday night and met my friend Susan at 2am at my place and we drove out to Detroit for the FIRST regional out there!!  I was super-bummed that I couldn't make it out there for Friday (since WildStang won every round we were in!)  but that was ok.  It was nice being in 80 degree weather in SF on Friday :) Anyway, we watched the regional all day and I worked on strategy for Dan.  We picked a couple of awesome teams in the "draft" since we were the #1 seed, but we ended up losing in the tournament part because of some oversights between rounds (stuff being unplugged or not set..).  Oh well...we learned a lot for the Northwestern Regional which is this coming week!!!  Anyway, if driving to detroit and doing FIRST all day wasn't enough, Susan and I went out to dinner and drove all the way back to Chicago!  Such a crazy but totally fun day!!  And great as always to hang out with Susan.  Kinda funny since I just hung out with Eliza-Beth the other day :)  (If you don't know the Twomey-Lerch story, ask me sometime!)   This week was super fun as well.  I ended up going to work in Libertyville on Monday to participate in an open house for our design group.  Our designer is over in China, so he asked if we could step in for him.  So that was fun, but I got this random t-shirt with a devil on it for participating...don't ask :)  But being in Libertyville meant that I could meet Stacie for dinner!! (a theme that will repeat itself over the week) :)  We went to Firkin which is the most awesome restaurant in the suburbs.  They have this amazing vegan chimichanga! :)  Other highlights if the week include green beer with stacie on St. Patricks day and getting to meet our new CEO on Friday at our Motorola Labs tech fair!  He was cool and seemed to like our work, so that was super cool as well :)  And then when I was hanging out with my friend Jenny and some of her friends at a movie on Friday night, I ran into an old friend from like preschool onwards who just happened to be in the same show!!  He did FIRST in high school too, so he's coming to the regional next week!!  I haven't seen this guy in years, and now I'll see him twice in one week!  Crazy!  It's been snowing all week! :(  (And it's even snowing right now as I write this!!)  Man, what a difference from the 80+ weather out in california.  I keep debating what I should do with my life.  If CA is the place for me.  It would be hard to find a company as diverse at Motorola in the things they work on (without going to the Evil Empire) so right now I'm just thinking.  One thing that's great about motorola is that one day you could be working on devices for the home, the next year on something for cell phones, the next on things for the car, or things for police men, etc.  We do a lot, and the different areas are pretty exciting.  Oh well...we'll see what this year brings!!    So Tuesday is the big "valentines day" with Ethel!! :)  Man, I am SOOOOOOOO excited! :)  I really really hope it goes well!!  We're going up to the Milwaukee Art Museum and then hanging out, talking a lot, going out to dinner.  We'll see how it goes...but man, Ethel is super-cool...and she's gonna be Miss Wisconsin someday! :)  OK...I should go clean...that's going to be an all day project since I've been coming and going to CA so much lately I have stuff all over!!  And I get to hang my new pictures that I got with stacie at IKEA yesterday!! Fun fun :)  Have a great weekend everyone!!!!

      Hey!! No, I haven't disappeared!! I've just been super busy out here in Cali!! :)  Last week was busy getting all of my code in organized for this release, so that was pretty intense.  But I got to drive up to Berkeley one night and hang out with my good friend Eliza-Beth!! :)  So that was awesome!!  Despite the fact that it took two hours to drive up there!  But hanging out with Eliza at Naan -N- Curry made the drive totally worth it!  This weekend was quite the adventure as well!!  I drove down to LA which was *the* most amazing drive ever!!  You know that green mountain that is the default wallpaper background from windows xp??  I saw *that* on my drive...and so much more.  So many amazing mountain ranges!! :)  And I got to hang out with my aunt and uncle down there and meet a cool cousin I never knew about!!  But I think I figured out that I need at least a week out here in California to get to see everyone I want to see!!  I made it down to Whittier to visit Allison, but didn't have time to make it to Pasadena to see Irvin or down to San Diego to see Marissa!  :(  Allison and I had a tasty lunch though and it was fun to hang out with her in that very beautiful city!!  I'm back up in Mountain View now finishing out the week!  It should be pretty busy, but that's cool...things should calm down a little when I get home.  Except for this crazy weekend!!! We've got a FIRST competition in Detroit, so Susan and I are driving out at 3am on saturday morning!! :)  Should be an awesome time!!  Speaking of the robot!!  Check it out!!!   urlLink http://www2.wildstang.org/2004/video/WS2004encore_v2_vcd.mpeg   I'll see all you chicago people again next week!! :)

      So I've been coding up something fun and interesting for work these last few days.  Well..."for" work...it's related to what I'm working on right now, but is sort of just my own special project that I felt like working on in my spare time.  And you know what?  I'm actually having *fun* coding!  Yes yes, I'm sick, I know.  But it's been great, and I look forward to coming home and coding at night :)  So I guess that job doing UI design just isn't for me!  Even though it is downtown!  Have a great weekend everyone!!  If anyone is doing anything fun tomorrow night, let me know!!!

      So it's been a long day...and week so far.  I'm bored.  We really haven't done anything at work since the last time I came back from CA.  It's just been a really long and dull month.  I'm the only coder left there, so it's hard to just start up a side project, since one person's side time is pretty small.  We're looking for a new person, but you know the selection of people who want to code in schaumburg, il is pretty small!!  Especially good people!  So no hope of having anyone else to code with anytime soon.  I'm thinking of applying for other jobs again.  There's one as a UI designer for Metadata and Social Awareness apps downtown at moto.  I'm not a big fan of the group, but it might be a fun job.  I think I'd actually miss coding though.  And then there's san francisco...mmmm....maybe.  HP labs?  Google/Orkut?  I don't know if I really want to leave chicago though.  I have so many good family and friends here.  Anyway, that's what's been going on in my head lately!  That and a big conversation about love and relationships and being happy.  Just trying to figure out what it'll take for me to be happy if things don't get better in that area of my life anytime soon.  Certainly not my current job...  And I'm still pretty hurt from this whole Ethel thing, so that doesn't help matters.  But I made the best of today and found some interesting papers and posted our new job post everywhere imaginable :)  And then I left work and realized it was such a nice day out and went for an awesome run along the lake front!!  Man, Chicago sure is beautiful when it's nice outside.  Running just made me forget about everything and just totally relax.  Well, as much as one can relax with super-strong winds blowing at you :) :)  But yeah, it was awesome!  And now I'm watching the cubbies :)  Go Maddux!!!

      The Cubs game was awesome!!! (aren't all trips to wrigley awesome??)  Thank you SO much Susan for inviting me!! :)  Kerry Wood was awesome and Sammy hit a home run and the cubbies won 3-0.  So wonderful!!  Although the windchills must have been below freezing.  It was a bit chilly :)  Here's an interesting quote I'm lifting off of amrys' blog...  From the Boston Globe...  Said Dornfest: ''The difference between a hacker and consumer is a consumer says, 'I wish it would work this way.' A hacker says, 'I've got a screwdriver and a few minutes.' "  I liked that quote :)

      Hey everyone!! This was an awesome weekend down in Atlanta!!  We had our FIRST nationals and although the robot wasn't the best one out there, it was a good time.  Despite total drama among our students!  Last night we went out for the traditional "WildStang" engineer party and Dean Kamen came along.  How cool was that???  Although I'm really not a big fan of his.  He has this idea that FIRST should be all about inspiration and not about education.  I really feel it's a great opportunity to teach students about the world of engineering...to give them hands on experiences in different engineering diciplines and give them exposure to something they don't get in their classes.  building a robot for the students just totally breaks that potentially awesome experience for them!  Anyway...FIRST was fun, but I miss having it at Disney World!!  The Georgia Dome just can't compete!!  Have a great week everyone!!! :)

      poll of the day... please vote in the comments section.  I'm more interested in moral feelings about this, not like the hypothetical three people who all believe it's ok and thus act this way.  Cause of course it's "ok" for them.  dating more than one person at a time is...  i) morally wrong ii) ok if everyone knows iii) ok in any circumstance  I think you all know how I feel about this right now.

      So the rumors are true.  Well, partially.  It's 5 years rather than 3.  But there are other interesting caveats.  I don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm sure I'll figure it out and get plenty of advice from you all :)

      The description for the Chicago Cubs community on Orkut:  description: For the world's greatest masochists.  I liked that :)  Although most cubs fans today are just fans because the cubbies did so well last year!  Boo to Wrigley selling out so fast! :(  If you're not on Orkut, let me know and I can invite you in!  It's a friendster like thing that's cooler...and not annoyingly slow!!

      Hi!  Not much new going on around here.  It was a pretty quiet and relaxing week for once which was a welcomed change!  I started playing with Orkut, so if any of you are on there, feel free to add me!! :)  And I found out that it was started by this guy Orkut who wrote a bunch of papers on small screen interfaces for searching that I read back at MIT.  Yeah, kinda random.  Anyway...  FIRST nationals are next week (April 15-17) in the Georgia Dome!!!  I'm so excited about that, but I know it just won't be the same as when they were at Disney World.  FIRST just means Disney to me as that's where the national championships were every year I participated.  And there's just something about EPCOT and Disney that a 70,000 seat area in the middle of downtown Atlanta will ever be able to match.  But it will still be a ton of fun and I'm sure our robot will do well as always! :)  Not much else new around here...hope you all have a great week!! :)

      Hey! :)  So last night I went to go see Super Size me with Elizabeth!  Fun times!  And a great movie!!  Although it's always weird to be watching a documentary in a theater!  If you haven't heard about it, it's a movie about this guy (who has a vegan chef girlfriend!!) who decides to eat nothing but mc donald's for 30 days.  He ends up gaining a ton of weight and almost destroying his liver and amazes several doctors on the way.  More than that though, it's about Americans and their changing eating habits, over-reliance on convenient fast food, and total lack of understanding about nutrition.  Go see it!! And it features crazy IL high school PE classes which some of you still don't believe me about!!!  And if anyone in Chicago wants to see it, I might be able to be talked into going again :)  I know I promised a few of you I'd see it with you!  The storms seem to be over and the cubbies won today!  What better day could there be?? :)  I hope you all had great memorial day weekends where ever you are! :)

      So I filled out this little personality thing today and I've never seen anything so dead-on.  Here's me in a few bullet points :)  - The unwritten message you may believe in, but not communicate fully to others, is to live life to its fullest and to do as much as possible to enrich personal experiences.  - You are optimistic and tend to make others feel good about themselves.  - You want to be seen as an innovator, but at times may forget some of the small details necessary to carry out the plan.  - You tend to be influential in decision-making situations. Others often turn to you for advice.  - You are a big thinker with big plans and a big image that usually carries through.  - You are usually enthusiastic about activities and planning.  - You are always striving for individuality, and take every opportunity to ensure that you enjoy it in an unusual and free lifestyle. You prefer an unstructured approach that can change at your will.  - You take a "never say never" approach to new opportunities, and strongly desire attempting the untried. As a result, you may undertake things which have never been suggested before.  - You communicate honestly and forthrightly with others. You offer quick reactions, and sometimes shoot from the hip, causing others to balk occasionally at your directness. You have a strong need to be truthful and straight in communications.  - More quiet and conventional people may find you to be unconventional and uninhibited in your interactions with others. Your bluntness and directness may shock some.  - You are not wishy-washy about ideas or opinions. You are firm, direct, persistent and opinionated about activities. Others always know right where you stand on all issues.  - In making decisions and communicating those decisions to others, you may seem somewhat arbitrary about certain ideas. Others may view you as a "hip-shooter."  - You are very good at communicating with others and seeing their point of view.  - You like to resolve issues well the first time, and then move on.  - You tend to be self-reliant and not enjoy relying solely on others.  - You are skilled at finding "win-win" solutions when conflicts arise.  - You don't get bogged down when the going gets tough in a relationship.  - You are passionate about your ideals.  - You want no close supervision--you don't want people to hang over your shoulder.  - You want freedom from many rules and regulations and the ability to write your own rules.  - You want equal relations with others.  Pretty scarily right, I'd say! :)

      So going to the metro last night really got me into this "I really want to go see bands this summer" phase.  So if you want to come see bands with me, let me know :)  Music is awesome! :)  *clarification*  I mean like real bands, not like big fancy bands you've heard of before.  Let's go see some cool local bands no one has heard of and probably never will!! :)

      Hey everyone!  So 30 bands in 60 minutes was truly awesome!  Such a fun time and a really great group of local bands.  A lot of political flavor to things, like in the neofuturist plays themselves, and that made things even more fun.  I mean come on, a concert sponsored by the onion???!!!  It has to rock :)  Then I hung out with a friend from work and some of her friends.  That was cool and fun to hang out in wrigleyville :)  I seem to be spending a lot of time down that way lately :) :)  At least it's someplace besides Jonny O'Hagans :)  Although, Susan, anytime you're in town, I'm always up for that place!  Goodnight everyone!  I must sleep now so I can make it to work tomorrow!!

      So it took me two hours to drive home today.  There are like two roads open over the river right now, and only one anywhere near where I want to go, so traffic was horrid.  :(  Oh well!  But I did have a great meeting up in Libertyville this morning!! Yay!  And ran into an old FIRST mentor *IN* the meeting!  How awesome is that!!??!!??  She's like, woah, what are you doing here??  I was like, um, I'm presenting :)  It was great :)   Not much else new here...I'm off to read another larry book right now :)  Should be interesting...

      So I came to the realization today that I really enjoy being a code monkey.  There's just some joy in writing code for me.  And, I know right, anyone who knows me knows that I never really liked writing code all the much before.  But seriously, I miss it, a lot.  So let's hope we pick something at work that involves a whole bunch of coding for me and whoever our new hire turns out to be :) :)    Maybe I should have my head examined ;)

      so yesterday I just remembered another reason why I love chicago so much.  And it has to do with a little blue W on a white flag.  Nothing beats riding in the el past Addison just after the game is over and hearing the whole car of people cheer when they look out the window and see that W flag flying in the wind over the bleachers.  Aw yeah.  Go cubbies!! :)

      I'm really tired of people who feel that they have to get drunk or stoned to meet someone.  Long story, but I just got back from a party at a friend's where people were puking all over and everyone was really drunk and hitting on each other.  Yeah, that might be fine in college or whatever, but man, I'm way beyond that.  I don't want to hook up with someone cause I think they're hot after a few drinks and a few hits, you know?  I want to really get to know someone for who they are, not who they think they are after a few beers.  And it's like, come on, we're all like 24 or 25, you think we could all get through a night without all passing out.  It's not like we're all 18 again!  And why does everyone feel a need to try to meet that "someone" at a party like that.  I will never understand!  Anyway, a sad night, but I ran into a few old high school friends and some of Jen's friends from law school, so that was kinda fun! :)  Oh well, there's some better way to meet people out there I'm sure.  Someday I'll find that single, cool, outdoors-loving, environmentalist, economist and onion reading, intelligent, fun girl with a positive attitude! :)  Goodnight all!

      I'm on a deep thought kick this week.  I was talking to a friend again today about how cool the weather is - and the ability to predict when a storm would hit to the minute.  Which turned into a talk about how cool life is in general.  And how cool it is that we can keep breaking down ideas to deeper and deeper levels.  Like how we can think about large storm systems moving, or look at local wind changes, or look at all the little particles moving around, or think about what all those particles are made out of and how they interact...and it just keeps going.  Not only is that cool, but it's cool that we can think about all that...like that we're all wired up to be able to think about things like that.  It amazes me :)  Life is cool :):)  Not much new here.  Just relaxing tonight and staying in and staying dry.  Does anyone want to go see "Super Size Me" in Evanston sometime??  It looks really good!  I'm on a movie kick this week :)

      So I had a conversation with a friend tonight about Chicago...and then went to go see "This Old Cub" (more about that in a minute)...but both of those just really reminded me of the fact that I really do love this city.  I love the neighborhoods, all the restaurants, downtown, the el, fun theater, really great people, and of course the wonderful cubbies.  As much as I think San Francisco is cool, Chicago will always be home and a really comfortable place with TONS to do.  But yet there are totally times when I think of "What would it be like to live in california...or back in boston?"  And maybe it's just me being a 7 and wanting things that are "new", but you know, there's *so* much to do out there and so much to experience.  Who really knows what's best to do?    Anyway, thanks for listening to my ramblings...maybe someone can make sense of that!  Now onto the good stuff!!  This Old Cub!!! Amazing.  Truly amazing.  Every cubs fan needs to watch it.  And cry, and laugh, and feel that wonderful feeling you get whenever you see wrigley.  It's an amazing story of Ron Santo and his journey to play through diabetes and his longing to see the cubs win and get into the hall of fame.  And more than that, it's about the fans, the team, and the place that is wrigley field and how it's just a cultural part of chicago, passed through the generations.  Watch it! :)  And Shrek 2 is *awesome*...in entirely different ways, but it made me crack up so many times!  You need to see that too!!!  Thanks to Laura and Em for coming out tonight!! It was fun!!! :)  Sad you couldn't make it Stacie! :(  And chicago people...please let me in on your top beer garden picks!

      Walking around downtown today on the way to a meeting at our michigan ave. office I was reminded as I always am down there how much I love the city.   The buildings, the people, *all* the people, walking past the museums, seeing grant park and the lake out the window, all the stores, and all the people :)  It's wonderful! :)  Man, I wish I could live down there!  But my drive is long enough as it is!  Not much else new around here.  Went to a FIRST meeting again tonight that the students put on.  They're taking the robot over to a junior high to try to get some interest in our team among the kids coming into meadows next year!  It's awesome...totally their initiative...totally planned by them!   It's so great to see them so involved!!  :)  Oh, if anyone wants to go see the Ron Santo movie, This Old Cub, tomorrow night at 7:35 at Streets of Woodfield, let me know!!!  I've heard it's AWESOME!!!  And hey...maybe shrek 2 afterwards???  Yeah!

      bonjour!  I just got back from my french class and wondering around evanston for a while.  It really reminded me how much I really like this city....just the fact that I could walk from one of the most beautiful campuses around out to the lake and down into a part of town with a million restaurants and a great library and then back up to my apartment is awesome :)  Being able to walk places is good :)  So is having 1/2 of my french class be vegetarian!!  And learning phrases like "I despise meat" and "I don't eat beef" and "I am a vegetarian."  yay!  Oh, and libraries that have c# books are cool too! :)  I am saddened by the fact that microsoft tools are so easy to use.  I mean, yes, I should have assumed, but man, picking up visual studio .net today and not ever having used it or knowing anything about c#, I was able to write a simple GUI application and cross compile it and put it on an ipaq in about 15 minutes.  It blew my mind!  I'm also trying to figure out how to best asses people's programming skills.  We're bringing three people in for interviews next week.  So if you've been on a great interview or have asked some interesting questions you think worked really well, let me know!!!  Have a great night everyone!!

      Tonight was our FIRST awards ceremony and it brought back a lot of great old memories of being on WildStang in high school.  They still give out a lot of the same old awards and the student awards are just as funny as ever.  I got an award for always smiling so much, which I thought was pretty cute :)  Then of course we all went out afterwards which was great as usual!!! :)  But now I've gotta head off to bed cause it's getting late! :)  Hope you all had wonderful days! :)

      Today was another wonderful day!  An old friend from high school was down from Madison and we had a wonderful dinner at Blind Faith (mmm...best veggie restaurant ever!) and then went off to an Early Music concert at Alice Millar! :)  It was a great time and a wonderful ending to a really nice weekend!  Hopefully this week at work will be just as wonderful :)  There's not a whole lot else going on with me right now.  Just a lot of thinking about what I want to do with my life...where I want to go...what experiences I want to have.  Debating back and forth every day if going back to school is what I want to do.  I really enjoy having my own projects to work on...things that are truly my own or just shared with a group of people...not things that are "managed" by people not involved in the work itself.  And unfortunately there's like two places where that can happen...in school, or at Microsoft research :)  And let's just say I'm not ready to move to seattle yet, although I've heard it's beautiful up there.  I just don't think I could handle the rain!!  But in the mean time, we'll see what crysta and I and whoever we hire can cook up to work on at work.  If we get to go ahead with what we have planned, it should be an awesome summer!!  But someday I know san francisco is calling my name :)

      So today turned out to be a really fun day! :)  I ended up going shopping for some nice spring clothes at an outlet mall up by stacie in wisconsin ;)  And then met up with her for dinner and to watch the cubbies win!!! :)  It's always great to spend a good evening with a good old friend!  And even better when it involves the olive garden and the cubs!!!  Hope you're all having a wonderful weekend!  Looks like I'll be spending much of tomorrow doing some work!  It's ok...cause as soon as this more boring work is done, we'll be able to do some really cool and interesting research!!! :)  And I almost forgot that I get to go to blind faith with my friend Elizabeth from high school tomorrow!  yay for fun weekends with friends :)

      So I've resolved to try my hardest to return to my old optimistic self! :)  I've just been really down lately in so many areas of my life and that's just not at all who I am and how I want to live!  So starting today things are looking up! :)  I'm going to do all I can at work to make it a happy place and a place where we can really work on some interesting ideas and collaborate with others who want to work on interesting ideas.  And I'm not going to be all sad about not seeing anyone right now.  I'm just gonna have fun being where I'm at right now! :)    So I'm sending a big old smile back out to all of you and saying that the good old frank is back!!!! :) :) Yay! :) :)

      It's amazing how important physical space is to being able to be creative!  One of the biggest problems that I find at work is that it's very hard to run into people who are doing interesting work in the labs.  Even people on our own labs on the other side of a high cube wall are not easily accessible.  I guess after all those years working in *the* cube at the media lab or the intelligent room or vision common space at the AI lab, I just came to appreciate a bunch of people working in a big common area and the interactions that that sort of activity supports across projects.  That's the single biggest weakness of the labs at motorola.  Anyway, there's a new building at MIT designed especially for interaction.  Check  urlLink it  out! :)

      Much better day at work today although it involved writing a very painful document.  It seems like people are seeing the value in the ideas we came up with and that we'll be able to go ahead with them!! Yay!  And that we're gonna move it into high gear really soon!  Yay, cause I'm sick of writing requirements documents that should be done by product groups! :)

      So this is shaping up to be a pretty good week :)  And I just realized that I'll be going out drinking every night until Friday, which should be a blast for sure!  Who wants to go out on Saturday ;)  Last night a bunch of the high school students got together to have a meeting about how we can help spread the message of FIRST to other schools...working with junior highs to get information about FIRST Lego League and FIRST to them, and also working to get some sponsors for high school teams and getting other schools interested in starting teams.  It was awesome, and great to see some student initiative!!  Hopefully next year will be a lot better on the team and we can really work to involve the students *so* much more!  That's my goal anyway :)  So after the meeting we wen't out for the obligatory after-monday-night-meeting drinks (without the students of course!)  Today was interesting.  We talked with our manager about what we want to work on over some beers and it's clear we have a different idea from her about what we should be working on this year.  But it looks like we'll be able to do our own thing, so that's exciting :)  And I just got back from French class at NU, which always makes me happy!  Yay for class :)  Wow..never thought those words would be coming out of my mouth...but there they are.  I miss school :)  Or maybe I just miss being around a lot of motivated people, who are interested in doing all sort of things, who really want to be involved and want to learn and really do great things?  One of the guys in the class made a comment about Motorola "sucking the life out of engineers"  There may be some truth to that!  We'll see if things can get better here soon...hopefully with new management and new hires, things will get a lot better!

      Summerfest again today!!  Things that rock:  Seeing Lewis Black in the second row!  Leinie's beer!  Lots of music playing all over!  Hanging out with my awesome friend susan!  The Milwaukee Art Museum!  MIlwaukee on a nice warm summer night!  So yes, summerfest rocked tonight.  And Lewis Black, as always was totally hilarious :)  And last night we had an earthquake in chicago!!  I work up at like 1:11 and was like, hmm, odd that I woke up right now.  Felt a little odd, but was like, whatever, and went back to bed.  Then I get up and learn about the quake.  How bizarre!  Only a 4.5 and about 70 miles away from here, but still, bizarre!  OK...to bed now!  Hope you're all having a great week so far!!  Who wants to see counting crows at the taste on the 4th???

      Race to the Taste this morning!! Awesomeness!!  Tons of happy people, a fun run along Michigan Ave, the lakefront, and grant park!  What a beautiful Sunday morning!!! :)  I had a blast, was just running for fun and still finished in just under 28, which is ok for my very first 5K.  I want to get it down to 26 by the next one I run though, and I think it's totally possible since I had a ton left in me at the end of it all!  And I even got a "yeah mit!!" from the sidelines...not sure who it was, but very cool :)  (I was running with an MIT shirt on)  And the taste itself!! Yay for vegan friendly food (unlike that little festival to the north ;)  )  Veggie ribs, veggie dogs, veggie indian food, corn, fruit, mmmm.  Oh so delicious! :)  So I'm up to the MIT chapters of A Beautiful Mind now.  I was reading it on the el (woah, almost said T) ride back from the taste today.  All the talk of living in boston, walking across the bridge to MIT, building 2, professors like Mattuck being quoted (how LONG has that guy been there??), talk of professors who go on random tangents and don't ever get to the point (reminds me of crazy 18.03 recitation instructor...mr excuse me while I go snort something and come back and teach you...yeah, him)  Good memories :)  I was smiling and this girl next  to me on the el was like "fond memories"  I was like, totally! :)  It's funny how a place basically doesn't change in 50 years while so much in the world is so different.  MIT still had a gazillion kids from Sty, still has the same old buildings and offices and common rooms, still has a lot of the professors that were there in the 50s, and for the most part teaches all the same classes!  Kinda cool when you think about it :)  OK...off to watch movies this afternoon (Roger and Me! And I don't even have to drive through the snow to get it this time!)!  Go Michael Moore!! :)  Summerfest again tomorrow...Lewis Black!  Who is in???

      So yesterday was quite the day! :)  After learning that all my friends are procrastinators (hmm...I knew that already) and didn't get tickets for the evanston show of Fahernheit 9/11 before they sold out, I was suddenly faced with options!!  And being me, I decided to find a way to combine *all* the options :)  Yay!  So F9/11 was an awesome movie!  Go Michael Moore!  My dad even wants to see it!! Imagine that!!  So yes, very cool...maybe some people out there that have "I love Bush" blinders on will start to at least question some of his actions/motivations/lies. :)  That would be good.  Too many people in this country just blindly go on and "love" america and support without question the decisions our leaders make...it's good to see a movie that questions those actions and makes people really think about the way our country is being run!  So after the movie (we went to an early show in the afternoon!!), I decided to head up to summerfest!! Susan is always raving about it, and well, I had to go!!  And it's always wonderful to hang out with Susan!!!  We walked down to the fairgrounds from her place, walked around, ate corn on the cob (without butter for me!!), drank a lot of miller products and saw Guster play for about an hour and a half straight :)  SO much fun!!!  I'm gonna do it all again on monday for lewis black!! who wants to come along???  Maybe sometime I'll post a little rant about why I dislike my old church.  Went to a little ice cream social thing there with my parents today and was ridiculed by just about everyone for being skinny, vegan, and not seeing anyone right now.  Anyway, long story that's way more complicated than that and involves most organized religion I've seen in the midwest will be coming soon...  Lewis Black Monday!!  Seriously!  Who is in???

      So I saw this really awesome rainbow over the lake on my run today! It was sunny outside, but somehow drizzling a little bit and as I came around the corner of the lakefill, I saw the most amazing rainbow stretching from the city down in the distance back up to just north of the lakefill.  Very awesome and very happy :)  Yay for running!  Less than 4 days now until the Race to the Taste!! :)  I'm so excited!!! :) :)   Not much else new here.  I'm loving chicago more and more and more every day.  Seeing the skyline while I was running today, hearing "We're all Crazy in Chicago" just as the skyline came into view playing randomly on my iPod...it was great :)

      happy monday everyone! :)  it's *beautiful* in chicago!!  Seriously, I went for a run tonight and the view of the city was just so clear, and the sun was setting and the clouds up over the lake were all lit up in all sorts of oranges and pinks.  I wish I would have had my camera, but I was running, and well, you just can't have your camera or camera phone with you *all* the time!  last night was a ton of fun too!  we all went over to a co-worker's house for a BBQ for the NBA finals.  And although the lakers lost (sorry helen! :( )  it was a great time and we had *tons* of great food!!  good times :)  and I'll end this very random post with an article I found about the sad state of reading/writing education in the world today.  don't even remember where I found this link...   urlLink http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,5500,1052077,00.html   It's just so sad in this era of "teaching for the test" to see kids growing up without a thirst for reading and a creative passion for writing.  Great writing has nothing to do with following totally set patterns and has way more to do with content than format, but all everyone is getting graded on nowadays is just format.  Did you know that in Indiana, they grade essays by computer using some (probably really bad) AI algorithms.  There's *no* way that thing is going to understand anything great and creative!

Which, by the way, is a pretty crazy place if you've never been :)  Anyway, my friend Gina had a free drink special going from 8:30-10:30, so that was pretty sweet and I got to hang out with her and Joe and Jimmy and Ean and John and Katy and Christine and a bunch of other people from various eras of my life from preschool through to high shcool!  How fun is that!?  It's like a total high school reunion :)  Or at least an AP Calc/debate reunion :)  Fun times for sure, but now I must go to bed!  It's been a super-long day!!  Have a great weekend everyone!!!

      Hey!  I just got back from this awesome show called Drinking and Writing put on by a few of the neofuturists down at Rock Bottom!  It was a great show about prohibition era writers and their uses of alcohol in relation to their writing.  And as all neofuturist shows have, it had the own actor's personal viewpoints and experiences with "drinking and writing" :)    Oh, it brings back good old memories of creative writing classes at MIT.  Especially a story I love to share about a professor that will go nameless for right now.  He has an interesting story....in that he used to be a porn star.  Well, just for a brief period of time, until he got invited to portugal to write a biography, but he really just went there to smoke free pot.  Anyway, my story is digressing...he used to have *big* parties for his final exams where he'd bring in a keg and some pot and everyone would have a good old time well, "drinking and writing."  But one day this really old math professor who was proctoring an exam in the room next door comes over and was like "what the hell is going on in here!"  And well, good old writing professor says "we're having a final exam, can't you see!?" :)  Ahh, MIT :)  And ahh, writing.  I miss it, I have to do more of it.  Maybe look for some of it posted here someday.  We shall see...  Then I met two awesome people on the el on the way home.  Just randomly started talking to one, and then the other was talking to me on the purple line.  Fun times and fun people.  Chicagoans can be so friendly :)  At least students in chicago :)  I love the el...riding though interesting neighborhoods with so many little details that you can never see them all.  Like the "Bag and Wig" shop or the pre-recorded birk squawking that plays at Howard, or the voice that whispers "This is Grand" when you get to Grand Ave.  Yes, it's a great city :)  But for now, I must go to bed.  Goodnight everyone!!

      So as promised, here's my litte rant on dating and relationships.  I guess I'm just going to make a few (hopefully insightful) comments about things I've been thinking about lately.  The biggest conclusion that I've come to is that "dating" in the traditional sense is really not the way I've ever started a "successful" relationship and that it's probably not the best way to start one in the future.  You know, I've always just become really good friends with someone and taken things from there.  It's like, how do you know if you'd really like someone until you know them for a while, are around them in different circumstances, and really get to see what it is that makes them tick and makes them special?  The normal "dating" way of doing things just really gives a totally rosy picture of things and doesn't usually let you into really seeing who someone is.  And makes people get emotionally involved which can keep them in a relationship they just really shouldn't be in.  It's not like I need to be dating people to be happy.  It's my friends that totally make me happy anyways :)  Obviously, when I do find that right person someday, I totally want them to be my best friend, so it makes sense to me at least for things to start as good friends too.  Another thing I've been thinking about a lot lately is what makes a successful relationship.  You know, what really makes something that will last.  My biggest conclusions on that front is again, that it takes a total trusting friendship and understanding.  Both people have to be willing to go above and beyond to be there for each other...to understand and talk through things that come up...or to just be there to hold each other when there are no words suitable for explanation.  That's something that's been missing in a lot of my former relationships.  And seems so basic to me...it's what love is all about, yet so many people just don't seem to get what it takes to make something last.  So I don't really know the "point" of all this writing, but it feels good to write down what's been going on in my head :)  And if any of you know cool people who have a little engineer/scientist and a little artist/writer/musician in them, are smart and inventive, love to smile, are totally random and love doing all sorts of interesting things, have a super-big heart, and most importantly are single, I'd love to meet them and make a new friend.  And who knows, maybe someday something will work out, but in the mean time, nothings beats some new awesome friends :)  I'm not actively trying anymore to do the "dating" thing.  It's just not what I want or what I think leads to something successful.  And who knows, maybe one day one of these friends will become someone special.  From what I've been told though, my standard of special is pretty high...not that there's anything wrong with that :)  I'll end with a little poem by one of my favorite neo-futurists who is now shooting Ocean's 12 in europe!  Love is...giving hugs.  Love is...forgiving.  Love is...pure, uninhibited laughter.  Love just is...and it's wonderful, isn't it?

      so today my ipod played me some old green day music (like *old* from 1991 when they were on an independent label from berkeley) and I was happy.  I miss that good old punk music from the early 90s!  Time to go find some more like that!  Maybe tie that in with local band listening-to this summer cause the sound is still around here.  Anyway, random thought.  I went to a steakhouse for the first time in three years today for my dad's b-day!  but don't worry...they had a veggie burger on the menu, and it was actually really good!  yay for veggie food infiltrating the midwest!!  and for my dad turning 64!!  Not much else new around here.  Be looking for a rant on relationships and dating coming soon (like maybe tomorrow).  And thanks to everyone for some conversations the last few days on the topic!  As a final note, no word back from the friday night date girl.  Sad, but as you might see in my post tomorrow, maybe not all that bad.

      Yay for Lauraf telling me about printer's row today!  It was a great time and there were just *so* many books there!!!  And cheap too...now I have a backlog of books to read including A Beautiful Mind, New Ideas About New Ideas, Problems of Knowledge and Freedom, For Love of Country, Innocent Eréndira and Other Stories by GG-M, Don Quixote, and a new vegan cookbook!  And all for under $35!  Yay!  And we got to hear a talk by Dave Eggers which was entertaining too!  And there was a group doing skits from Schoolhouse Rock!  I'm just a bill, yes I'm only a bill...  :)  To sum up, all in all a very fun saturday! :)  Who wants to cook yummy vegan things with me out of my new cookbook??

      Today was wonderful!  And it was wonderful weather outside! :)  A friend interviewed for a job in our lab, and that was fun :)  I got to have lunch with the CTO, which was pretty cool.  And I had a nice dinner at Blind Faith followed by a nice walk along the lake and a good movie at the Evanston theater.  That last part sounds like a date, you might be thinking :)  It was...it was cool.  I think there will be a second date.  Yay! :)  Maybe heading down to printer's row tomorrow...maybe random beer garden afterwards.  Who's with me???  You know you want to!

      So today I found out that Ethel and Eric just picked out a ring together. It's like, woah, you have to be kidding me!  It's like what, two months ago not even that she was thinking of breaking up with him and John and only seeing me, and now she's marrying the guy?  I just don't get it.  At all...  Speechless...  But in happy news work is going super-great and I am SO excited about what we'll be working on for the next year!! Yay!!! :)

      So a friend brings back up the pop vs soda vs coke debate.  I still remember coming to MIT and having a kid from texas hold out a mountain dew and ask me if I wanted a "coke"  I was like...um...sure!  And he handed me the mt. dew :)  And I was a confused midwestern boy :)   urlLink http://www.popvssoda.com/countystats/total-county.html   And more fun with regional words...   urlLink http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~golder/dialect/maps.php   It's pretty amazing how with the spread of mass media, internet, tv, magazines, and with people moving so much recently there is still such rigid segregation in these words!

      You know in Amelie where she goes into the grocer's apartment and moves his doorknob and changes out his shoes and resets his clock and..  Yeah, I'm sure you guys know.  So I get home tonight and come in my back door, go to take off my shoes and put them on my little mat like I usually do, but it's not where it should be.  I think, odd, must have slid when I left this morning.  So I go to the bathroom, and my window is closed, and I always leave it open when the weather is nice.  I go to wash my hands and reach for the soap, but it's not where it's supposed to be either.  Then I go to sit in my chair, and it's moved a little too!  It just felt really bizarre especially since I just watched Amelie again last night (It's such a feel good movie).  So anyway, to make a long story short, my landlord came in today to make sure all my windows opened up (which they didn't and now they do!) .  So I'm happy about that!  Hope you all had super-wonderful days!! :)

      Hung out with Stacie and a bunch of MIT people last night up in Gurnee!!  Fun times!!  We cooked up a mexican feast, saw The Village in the front row at Showplace 8, and just had a great time!!  It's fun when Alison can say that stacie has "a l33t tv" and no one even stops to think about the oddness of that statement.  Seriously though, stacie's tv is pretty cool...somehow it gets the name of the current show off of the analog cable signal and displays that on the TV when you're flipping channels.  Very cool.   OK...I'll stop being a geek now and get ready for the wedding I'm going to today and get Pat and Ron on the radio :)

      New Paul Graham article!  Yay!  He rocks...he's the guy who wrote the article  urlLink Hackers and Painters  and now he has a new one called  urlLink Great Hackers .  He makes a lot of good points about how to spot a good programmer and how hard that is until you've actually coded with her/him.  Which is very true...we're trying to hire someone in our lab, and the hardest thing is to tell when someone is great.  It's easy to spot good from bad, but great is hard to find without actually sitting down with someone and seeing how they solve some problems and approach coding.  And just looking at code is not enough...because a lot of the art in coding is how you get there and how you solve the problem...just as much or more than what the final results is.  If any of you haven't read the original Hackers and Painters, you should!  It's an interesting look at how writing good code is more like painting or architecture than anything else.  Which I totally think is true.  It's about being creative within bounds and thinking different.  It's about trying, sketching, revising, improving, and doing it all so that it fits the tastes and needs of the people who are going to use it.

      Cubs announcers rock...even TV ones.  Chip bought a book for Ron Santo called "How to speak dog" which has a dog named Ron on the cover and says "parlez-vous dog?" on the back.  For those not in the know, Ron Santo has been having issues with his new "french-speaking dog" that was rased in Quebec.  Listen to a cubbies game or two on good old WGN radio and find out the latest tales of the dog...

      Went to an awesome cubbies game last night up in milwaukee with my dad and susan!  SO much fun!  And awesome to go to a cubs game for $1 :)  I love milwaukee :)  Maddux was awesome, got win 299, and the cubbies actually drove in some runs not on homeruns for a change.  If they can keep this up, it'll be a great end of the season! :)  Not much else new around here...

      Walking around blockbuster today I was amazed one more time the crazy emotions you can feel just looking at movie boxes and remembering the times when you watched them.  Movies curled up with Annie or Laura, or good times out with friends in boston, or movies rented at student house and watched in the parlor late at night.  It's just cool that all that can come back to you just looking at a little box.  Our brains are awesome :)  Watching the sox game now!  Hopefully they can do what the cubbies couldn't today!  Especially against the yankees!!!  All this boston in the news with the convention and the red sox-yankees series has really made me miss that city even more!!  Oh, and John Kerry is at the game tonight...he was talking about how he hates the DH rule!  Yeah Kerry, giving me more reasons to vote for you in the fall ;)

      Schaumburg Flyers game was fun!  Even though they lost :(  Yay to susan for getting free tickets on the lawn!  Although why they made that lawn so steep, I'll never understand!  Today should be a  quiet day, which will be nice.  I should really start getting a portfolio together for grad school apps sometime.  Not today though.  I've been thinking a lot about why work is getting me down a lot lately.  And it's really the same thing that got me down last year about this time.  Our lab has a small group of really awesome, really smart people who know what they are doing and that I'd call leaders in the field in what they do.  Most of them are pretty young and working with them, we can do amazing things like our project last year turned out to be.  But the other half+ of the lab is made up of people who didn't keep up with changes in their fields, "software engineers" who don't know basic principles of software, and management that doesn't know anything about what any of us do and feel the need to micromanage the "good" people so they are applying practices fairly across everyone in the lab.    They've formed this change committee in the lab now to try to make things better...it'll be interesting to see what they come up with and if they are even listented to if what they recommend is rather drastic.  In any case, I'm glad to be looking elsewhere because I think the chances of improvement on a drastic scale are pretty small.  Google might be a fun place if I want to keep working, although school is sounding better and better right now :)  Boston or San Francisco might be in my future pretty soon!! :)  What a tough decision though if I get into both MIT and berkeley...

      WildStang reunion was tonight!! Yay!!  Got to hang out with a bunch of old friends from high school, old high school teachers, and the whole current FIRST crew!  It was a gerat time for sure, including susan's hidden beer, diana's scrapbooks, veggie "chicken" patties on the grill, and winning an award called 'don't rain on my parade' for always smiling.  Which was nice, cause I haven't been smiling a whole lot lately with my work situation, so  that put a big one back on my face :)  It's bizarre to talk to old teachers years later about the things you didn't think they knew about from back when you were a student.  Like stealing street signs, or exactly what went on inside that imagination ride, or jumping down on plymouth rock.  Anyway...fun times for sure!! :)  Flyers game tomorrow!  Yay!  And Susan is joining me, my dad, and stacie for a cubbies game in milwaukee on tuesday!  Who else wants to go??  We're getting in line at 3:30 or 4pm for cheap seats that go on sale at 5.  And you have to be in line to get a ticket...  Go cubbies!!! Another win today!!! :)  Now, I'm off to read some marquez short stories before going to bed! :)

      So I'm loving Frank Gehry a lot more.  His design for the new  urlLink Lab for Computer Science and AI lab  at MIT has a PUB on the 4and AND 5th floors!!!  Talk about designing a building for its occupants!  "Also in late August, the R and D Pub will open on the fourth and fifth floors of Stata to MIT community members and their guests. The pub will offer beer and wine as well as a typical pub grill menu of burgers and fries, grilled chicken sandwiches, pasta and salads. Regular hours will be 4 to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday. The pub will be available for events on weekends."  from  urlLink here  and more about the building  urlLink here

      so I'm reading this book about how MS does interviews...and they ask a bunch of programming/logic puzzles at the interview.  And there's this one about getting a series of people across a bridge in 17 minutes.  They all walk at different predefined paces and there's a little thinking involved to figure out the right order to send people across in.  And MS expects you to solve it in 5 minutes.  They said one guy wrote a c program to solve it in the interview...most people just reason it out.  But the best part was that they said the question was posed to 50 engineers at motorola, none of which could figure it out :)

      So I thought this week could not get any worse.  And I was wrong!  This morning was truly horrible and I had a good hour and a half + "discussion" with a coworker who decided to completely ignore the work we had done over the past year and a half and the nice APIs we've created and hack together a hard-coded one off.  So yes, lots of "discussion"  And TBC next week.  Oh work has been oh so fun lately!  But things got better as the day went on.  It looks like were back to almost doing the same project we had planned on and the last month was not for waste.  And then to make a bad day totally wonderful, I got to hang out with my awesome friend stacie!!!  PF Chang's lettuce wraps, good wine, borders, and King Arthur all brought me back to happiness :)  Stacie, you rock!!!!  Thanks so much for cheering me up! :)  Now though, it's off to bed!!!

      Wow...I think this has been the longest week ever at work!  And it's only tuesday...oh boy...  So just when we thought we had everything together and were all set to work on a project, people started questioning it, and it looks like we might be starting from scratch again.  Or at least have to change a lot of what we thought we were going to do.  It's really frustrating and just telling me more and more that I need to keep looking for other places to go and things to do.  Lauraf and I are studying for the GRE, so that's always an option!!  Who knows...but I'm just really fed up with things right now.  How hard is it to just make a decision and go with it?  Ugh, enough complaining.  I hate to complain...it's just been a horrid week so far.  Who wants to do something this week or this weekend?  I really need to get out!!!

      So within the past two days, two different friends of mine have said that they totally expect their boyfriends to not remember their birthdays this year.  Now, hmm.  This does not seem reasonable to me in any way.  It's like um, YOUR BIRTHDAY!  Maybe it's just cause I've always set up really extravagant birthdays for the people I have dated, but still, it seems like the guy should at the very least remember the day and do something for you, no?  Even if they are in a different city, some sort of nice card/poem/creative gift/something...Am I crazy?  I don't think so...  Although one person thinks I'm being too demanding in wanting someone that's smart, fun, and remembers my birthday...um, I'd hope for all that at the very least...  Went for a nice bike ride along the lake today...rode all the way down to Navy Pier.  A really nice ride...maybe 25 miles or so round trip.  It was great to see everyone out on the beaches and running along the trails.  And it was beautiful outside today too...like 75ish and sunny along the lake.  Although I now have a tan the shape of an ipod mini on my left arm...oh well :)  Now hopefully Kerry Wood can step back in the lineup tonight and beat these pesky cardinals!!  Let's hope :)

      Th cubbies are killing me lately!  But not as much as they are getting to Ron.  Man, on the radio today he was just completely devoid of hope...saying things like "*if* farnsworth can get another strike" and "I wonder what our pitchers feel like when we never have a pitcher up with a lead?"   So sad :(  Where are these guy's bats lately!!??  And still sad about the news from earlier in the week.  I'm having a nice relaxing weekend for once.  Lots of cubs game watching, reading, and relaxing out on the evanston beaches :)  Next weekend, TMLMTBGB and a beer garden...who's in???  And if anyone has any advice for studying for the GRE, let me know!!  My friend Laura and I are taking them this fall!!  I'm off for a run now!  Hope everyone is enjoying the nice summer weather!!

Yay!! :)  Then off to the game with Susan, a friend of hers and Em!  Good game, and I totally had a blast, but sadness, the cubbies lost again!  And wow...so I'm a big fan of traditional ballparks, but when your ballpark has skee ball in the outfield section, that's just damn cool :)  In unrelated news, again sadness that people I seem to fall for are all either taken or don't want anything to do with guys right now.  Sadness.  Oh well.  And I was *really* excited this time too :(  Go Cubbies!! :)

      Fun times at the game today!!  Went up there with my good friend from MIT stacie who is also a huge cubbies fan! :)  Met susan and friends, who got $1 seats!!!  Man, I wish Wrigley sold day of seats for $1!  I would so be in line all night for seats like that!!  But we had nice 9th row seats from a friend at work.  Totally amazing seats in a park that I must admit I actually really like :)  Too bad the cubbies couldn't come through, but that's ok....better luck tomorrow when I'll be back for more with the same people :)  Except all sitting together this time! :)  Fun fun!  I'm excited! :)  And I get to go on my very first Miller tour tomorrow, as well as experience closing at Wolski's...this bar that susan is always talking about :)  And I got to have lettuce wraps after the game at PF Changs!! :)  Mmmmm.  And went through the Wawatosa area without running into ethel...always a good thing! :)  Everyone cheer for the cubbies tomorrow!!! :)

      Summary:  Awesome weekend!!  Fireworks, Counting Crows, fun with Susan and friends, and two cubbies games coming!  So...I'm gonna go in sort of random order.  Cause that's just how I'm feeling right now :)  OK...so first off, there should never be a single store so big that you need a map to get around it!  We were all in Meijer last night...er, this morning.  And we just wanted to find some posterboard and sharpies.  (Cubs game!)  So we get a map and look at it while we're walking...and apparantly in a store of that size, a section like school supplies is too small to mention.  So we wandered for a bit, but susan found the right place!  Anyway, no store should be that large...though I'm torn cause it's cool to be able to buy just about anything in the world 24 hours a day.  :)  So now for tonight!  I went to go see Counting Crows with Lyci and her boyfriend!  Fun times, although it was H O T out in the sun!!  Got there around 1:15, got a good veggie dog and staked out a place on the lawn in front of the bandshell...pretty good seats too! Saw a cool band I've never heard of, The Old 97s...sort of punky rock sort of music.  They were good!  Then They Might be Giants came out and just totally sucked.  I don't think anyone in the crowd really wanted to see them...well except for these very odd people a few blankets down from us that seemed to be grooving with it :)  But the main event, Counting Crows!!  They were truly awesome!  The best concert I've seen this year for sure (Lewis Black isn't a concert!) :)  Tons of fun!  Then I came back and watched the evanston fireworks from the rocks on the beach...so fun!  So beautiful!!!  And I could walk home...very cool :)  Yesterday was a ton of fun too!!  Even though we got rained on at Frontier Days!  We still got a short ride on the Ferris Wheel, and got to go see Dodgeball!  Hilarious movie!!  If you go, you have to stay till the end of the credits, but then again, once you see that part, you might wish you left early!  That milkshake song will eternally bring bad memories to my mind!  But super fun to hang out with susan and friends!  And very very very cool to get to see Diana again!!!! Yay!!! :)  Now I must go to bed.  Two days of Cubbies fun in Milwaukee coming up!! Yay!!! :)  And they SWEPT the White Sox!!! Awwww yeah!!! Go  cubbies!!!!! :)

      The taste was fun tonight!  Got to hang out with an MIT friend and some high school friends.  Yay!  And got to walk by Millenium Park...awesome place!  I can't wait until it opens and I can hear a concert in the new outdoor stage.  If you haven't seen it, they have these huge arcs over the lawn with big speakers on them and mics so they can "bounce" the sound off of the ceiling that doesn't exist!  Basically it makes it sound like you're in a concert hall, not an outdoor ampitheater since you get reverberant sound and not just the direct field.  Yay, I learned something in professor bose's class that I actually used again!!  Go Bose! :)  Anyway, good food tonight at the taste!  The BEST veggie dog I've ever had.  It seriously tasted like the good old meat dogs I used to eat all the time growing up.  I was seriously fooled.  Too bad the restaurant that serves them is on like 72nd street or maybe I'd go sometime not at the taste!!  And again, I am in love with chicago...michigan ave on a nice warm evening.  Walking along by all the amazing architecture.  The wrigley building, tribune tower, smurfit stone, millenium park, the art institute, up to the water tower.  There's just so much variety in that little one mile walk!  And just such a great wonderful city!  Yay chicago!

      So I saw the Gin Blossoms tonight at Frontier Days!  Which for those of you not from the Arlington Heights area, is like this little suburb festival about 25 miles out of the city.  So it was cool that they were there.  It drew quite the family crowd though, and probably wasn't what the band was expecting...especially after playing Milwaukee's Summerfest last night!  So yeah, it was pretty quiet and laid back, but it was cool to hang out with old high school friends and relax a little.  Even if there was no dancing on tables :)  After the show, we went to this horrid bar.  If any of you find yourselves in downtown arlington heights, never go to Peggy's!  Our hostess was mean, our waitress was meaner, and you can't sit outside past 11:00.  Anyway, it was entertaining, if only to laugh at the waitress and reminisce about old high school memories :)  I love summertime in Chicago!! It's so great to see a bunch of really great friends and be outside.  Hopefully the weather will hold out for the weekend and I'll be able to catch a few more concerts with a bunch of great friends! :)  Have a happy 4th for those of you heading out of town!  And a happy Friday to everyone else!

      Brendan's wedding was awesome!!! :) :)  But I'm totally exhausted now!  Some observations that I'll expand on in the morning: 1) I love MN and people from MN 2) Telling another religion's creation story in a marriage ceremony rocks!  Especially when it's one where man and woman were created together 3) Clear Channel is evil...I heard Little Red Corvette about 6 times today 4) My iPod is possessed and plays music related to the places where I go :)  OK...I'll make sense of this nonsense in the morning :)

      The wrigley tour was awesome!!!!!!!!!  SO much fun!!  Thanks SO much susan for inviting me! :)  I had a blast!!  We got to go in the press box, dugout, bleachers, security office, and hear a lot of cubbies and wrigley history!!  So fun! :)  Totally weird to see wrigley empty!  Susan, I'm gonna miss you when you move!!  Then we went to my favorite wrigleyville restaurant!  Pick Me Up.  I had a great vegan chocolate milkshake and some awesome vegan french toast!  mmmmmm  So good!  And then got a copy of The Onion to read on the train back.    It's been a good day! :)

      I feel better about Bartman after reading  urlLink this .  Anyone who would donate all the stuff he got to JDRF is a true cubbies fan.  1) it's cool that bartman has an entry in the wikipedia 2) he still should have thought to see alou coming :)  I was thinking of adding a "little known fact" to the Alou page about...well...that thing he does with his hands before the game.  But decided not to :)  That's still SO GROSS!!!

      Boston  urlLink reacts  to the Nomar trade. (Thanks Em!)  People are, let's just say, pissed off!!  Makes sense though, Nomar was great and a lot about what Boston baseball was about for a long time!  Bush's quote that deserves no commentary: "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said.  "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."

      So I was flipping channels tonight and ran across Full House.  And was like, cool! Full House is on!!!  And then I realized what channel it was on...Nick at Nite!!!  And I was like NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  I remember watching Full House all the time growing up and it's crazy to think that that was like 14 years ago!  We're getting old!! :)  But what a cute old show!  I really want someone to put Perfect Strangers on TV again...I don't remember much of the show but remember I really liked it when I was like 12...and it's got Wrigley Field in the opening credits :)

      No lack of good news stories today....fresh from the daily show...  Everyone who went to bush's talk in new mexico had to sign a loyalty oath before getting into the hall...  "I, (full name) ... do herby (sic) endorse George W. Bush for reelection of the United States. (again sic)" The form further warns that signers "are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush."

      OK...one more post this morning that makes me sad...and kinda laugh at the same time.  Have you heard of  urlLink W Ketchup ???  Cnn says..  "Some GOP supporters, that would be Republicans, have created an alternative to Heinz ketchup. Company founder Bill Zachary says he and his buddies realized at a barbecue recently every time they brought out the famous ketchup, they were supporting Teresa Heinz Kerry to some extent.   So W ketchup was born. It features the likeness of George Washington. It costs $12 for four bottles of this stuff.   Zachary says he used the first president's image to avoid accusations that his product was an overt campaign ad. Well, it didn't work."  WTF???  Note on the FAQ that it is their "official" position that the W stands for Washington.

      As if the Cardinals weren't enough of a reason to hate the state of Missouri, 71 PERCENT of Missouri decided to formally ban same-sex marriages... urlLink CNN.com - Missouri approves same-sex marriage ban - Aug 4, 2004 .  71 percent!!!

      So my clock radio broke the other day.  Broke such that it's stuck on and on WGN :)  So that is now my living room radio for cubbies games :) :)  But I had to get another one, and guess what??  There's a Fry's in Chicago now!! Well, actually downer's grove.  For those not from california, Fry's is like a walmart for electronics stuff...picture Best Buy + CompUSA/MicroCenter + Radio Shack all in one place!  Very cool :)  On my way back I was daydreaming of Boston and ended up missing the exit to get on 94 north, so I ended up going to Lake Shore Drive...passing Buckingham Fountain, movies in the park, millenium park, the beautiful lakeshore, north avenue beach...  And reminded myself that Chicago sure is beautiful in the summer.  Boston is too though :) :)  OK...back to watching the cubbies game :) :)

      Lauraf has informed me that I need to complete a proper "purge" of my apartment.  So yeah, does anyone want to have a fire or something?? :)  In semi-related news Laurap asked that I never talk to her again.  Which is really really sad, and also the first significant ex that I'm not going to be in touch with anymore.  Which is sad...I mean over all that time you really start to care about someone and at least for me, it's hard not to wonder what they're up to or talk to them or help them move or whatever, you know?  Maybe I'm just weird...while some of my friends are still really great friends with people they have dated, others just totally forget about them.  I think I just grow to be too good of a friend that I can't not care anymore. no matter how things ended.

      The announcer on sports center said it best "No more Nomahhh in Bahston, now it's time for Nomaaaaar in Chicaaaago"  Aw yeah!! Go Nomahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!! :)  What a trade, and we didn't even have to give up clement!  And Boston paid us money?? What??  So crazy good for the cubbies!  I was down at Zack's wedding in Indiana last night.  It's so crazy that so many of my old friends have been getting married lately!  One of my MIT roommates is getting married next weekend too!  Crazy!  It just seems like we're all still so young, still so unsure of who we all are and what we want to do with our lives.  It's amazing to think that a year and a half ago Laura and I were thinking about getting engaged.  What a difference a year makes!  The past year has been really good for me though and I feel like I've grown up so much more than in any other part of my life and really started to get an idea of what's really important and more about the type of person I'd like to be with someday.  And I tried to get SRO tickets to today's cubs game...got down there all nice and early.  But WOAH, the line went from Clark and Addison to Sheffield and Waveland 5 hours before the game!  Needless to say that when tickets went on sale, we moved up about 100 feet and then heard the announcement that all SRO tickets were sold.  I stuck around for a little bit to see what I could buy on the street, but SRO was going for $125 and that was so not worth it...even to see Nomar and Maddux's 300.  Oh well...gotta go back up to Milwaukee later this month for $1 seats!!!
