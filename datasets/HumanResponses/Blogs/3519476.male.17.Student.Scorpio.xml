" haha then the guy in charge of the hall came in... thot he was going to scold us for doing such a dangerous thing... but he came up and just pointed to the ladder at the side and said u all can use that wat... haha my fren and i look at each other and laughed... so funny lor... so toot one... so we used the ladder to pick the rest of the shuttles... pick quite a lot and we were tired.. so we stopped... at that time also time to go liao... so we proceeded to have lunch nearby... after eating... we decided to go play soccer!!! haha wanted to play for v long liao and i am glad that i played today!!! so fun!!! hahha played till abt 5 and i went home to prepare for the conference at 7... went to meet my fren at alijunied mrt cos he dun noe his way there... went to the station and i found my sis there as well... haha she was wif her fren and they both said that i look like i just wakie... haha tink it is cos i didnt gel my hair... haha and that i am tired!!! today's sermon was power... but there were parts where i really just didnt agree wif wat the preacher was saying... came home at abt 1045 and i am dead tired now... thats all for now... aidos!!!!

      had my phy pract today and can say i am quite confident... =) ended at abt 1030... me and my frens went to mac to eat breakfast!!! haha we were all toking and laughing... after eating we all went home... me reached home and rest a while b4 i started to study... took a short nap then i prepared for the conference liao... me cycled to the venue and the service was great fun... during the praise and worship session i was crying and asking God to give me a sign that everything will be ok... and indeed our God is a God taht answers prayers... during sermon.. the sermon was abt the heart... it was exactly like God telling me to not worry and that everything is under control... feel v light-hearted now... ended at abt 930 and my sis and i started to walk home... v tired... walk home wif my bike... hahha hmm me composed a poem today... here it is...  dedicated to sweetie pie AKA ms beautiful...  i thot i was alone with no one by my side nobody to hear wat i had to say or see the lonely tears i cried beyond my imagination i thot of wat a fren would be someone who understands and is willing to cry with me... someone who cares enough and would be there no matter rain or shine a person who picks me up when i fall and asks if i am fine that image of a fren so clearly etched in my heart i was looking for that fren, but i didnt know where to start you came a long and offered me ur hand a smile was all it took; my broken memories u mend all along all that i thot was imaginary never seemed so clear i thot that i was dreaming the day when u appeared no words can express my gratitude in u being there for me the realisation that a fren cares wherever, watever it may be i cant help but smile whenever u are around and i am not smiling becos i am happy but for a fren in u i found...  feel that u r not urself... ms joy... hope this poem cheers u up!!!

      feel real sad... today went to the esplanade library to study... nice place.. was the 1st time that i went there... was studying then the librarian chased us out... hmmm we all went for lunch at raffles city shopping centre... spent quite a while there... then we proceeded to the librbary at orchard to continue studying... didnt understand the chapter that i was studying on... spent quite long... and i got a little fed-up... all grew quite slpy at that time liao... we made our way out of the library at abt 6... went to walk around for a while b4 proceeding home...just couldnt concentrate today... didnt feel like i was out studying wif frens... tink it is the way i am... felt left out... but nvm... maybe the poem will describe how i feel... haiz...   Solitude  needed somebody, yet i was all alone by myself in no man's land all that i felt, left unknown where was the comfort in my time of need i tried to reach out but yet i couldnt speak no one was there to listen wat my heart wanted to tell i was left mending my own thots crying as i fell... is it too much to ask that somebody be here to ease my troubled mind by just providing that listening ear my tears seemed to be my only companion i tried but i could not stop maybe they are my only true frens the only comfort that i've got as hard as i tried my smile just seem to fade away my heart as heavy as lead makes a sad end to my day i just wish that someone would tell me its alrite that in all taht happens, he/she will be by my side the world in all its splendour yet a place of little comfort my tears seemed to have dried up but i still feel that hurt...

      woke up and i was like a bit blur blur... today is wat day erh?? after washing up... i went on to do my poem... heez... suddenly like to write alot... at abt afternoon went over to my grandma's stall and i ate 2 bowls of laksa!!! haha it was real nice... could have had the 3rd bowl but decided not to... was already sweating like mad then... =p hahz my cousin came down a while later and then we proceeded to my grandma's house... heez.. we watched a little of tv and we were laughing at the show... so funny lor... really take my hat off to those taiwanese hosts... real lame and funny... hmm then i proceeded to church!!! reach church like still quite early... the service was fun and powerful and after that we went for dinner!!! haha went to KFC and the whole place was like flooded by all our youths!! we were all making so much noise haha then i had to chase after my bus... *groan* stomachache...   what can life be measured by the seconds that one waste away or the things that one does each new day like the coming of winter where the autummn leaves fall the prominence of a rainbow or the promise of something more life is but a mystery in itself shrouded with uncertainties, covered in veil yet behind that ominous disguise lies one that exudes optimisim the bringing of hope when all else fails the comfort of family and friends leaving behind their trail life constitutes of more than just living surely it cannot be just that you presented the best thing life has in store for me never will life be sad life remains subtle yet profound but i have its promises in hand the presense of close company in my heart together; leaving our footprints in the sand i have realised this... that life is not abt how u live it but rather who u live it with in all that one can say to describe it yet no words seem appropiate nevertheless life presented a whole new meaning till this very date

With all my heart  with all my heart with all my mind with all my strength i am gonna serve you everyday, in all my ways i gonna praise, praise you forever  even when troubles come into my life i will not fear cos i noe u are close by there's not a mountain that i cannot climb with you, with you  standing here now  with my mind and emotion  i make a vow to give all my devotion all my desires i place u above u are my God, u are my very 1st love...   used to tink that online blogs are stupid... but i guess i am wrong again... i guess thats all for now... feel better after telling someone... oops something... haha watever it is feel better after i let it all out...

      dunno wat i feeling today... was alrite till esther and eunice came to tok to me abt the mid yrs... took my mind back and it got me sort of down... started to wonder wat am i good for... and i really couldnt come up wif the answers... maybe i am really not good at anything.. not good for anything... really quite sad and it was then i realised the importance of care and concern... it got me tinking as to how caring can be split into 2 parts... pple care for the sake of caring... which many of my frens fall in this category... and caring becos they actually do care... sad to say i dun tink anyone fall here... haha... wanted to cry cos i really felt alone by myself... meeting the principal this sat and i am already looking forward to wat would be a "great" day i can hardly wait!!! dun really feel like going to sch tmr... but i guess it isnt my choice... oh yea took back my result slip today... suppose to let my parents sign... no prizE for guessing how they reacted... really wonder at times how did i come to be where i am today... yet all thru my life... i have never done anything to make myself or my parents proud of me... such a loser right... hmm haha say anymore will cry liao... so i guess i will stop...
