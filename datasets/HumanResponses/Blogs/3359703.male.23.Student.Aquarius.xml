      Hey, I thought you might want to receive money in the mail so here is a dollar... Do you want more? Well, please read this carefully, after all, I took the time to send you money.   Almost everyone has seen a pyramid scheme before but no one has ever played one out.  Below are reasons why people fail to participate in these opportunities historically.  Also listed are explanations to ensure that those reasons do not prevent this particular scheme to fail.  Reasons: Why It Didn’t Work in The Past   1. There has been no immediate gratification.    2. The perceived financial threat of spending money and not getting it back. 3. The complications of writing several copies of one letter.   Explanations: Why It Will Work Today  1. You have already received money and you didn’t do anything yet, immediate gratification! 2. Your risk is shared.  Receiving money before sending money lets you know that you are part of something, there is no financial threat.  Obviously if I sent you a dollar I am trusting that you will follow the pattern.  3. We live in an age of technology, only send letters to people who have access to the internet. Here is where you can download a copy of this letter and a copy of a blank name list for new letters at www.agentsofchange.blogspot.com (click on Pyramid Scheme)or you can make copies via copy machine.  How This Works  On the page that follows, there is a list of four names.  These names are rotated in a consecutive fashion from 1-4.  The first name on the list, # 1, is that of the person who sent you this letter. The second is the name of the person that sent them a letter and so on up till # 4.  Each person on the list has sent out ten letters total.  Upon receiving your letter with one dollar in it, (this letter), you will add your name to the top of the list at # 1.  In doing so, you will then rotate the other names down the list to their next consecutive spot.  The name listed at # 4 will be taken off the list because at that point you will mail them the dollar back that they originally spent on others (like you).  First step, go to www.agentsofchange.blogspot.com to print out ten copies of this letter.  Second print out ten copies of the numbered name/address form.  Take care of name # 4 by sending One dollar to their address.  Now you can remove name # 4 from the list and rotate the names down in a consecutive fashion, adding your name and address to the # 1 spot.  Now mail out ten letters with One dollar in each one to ten people you feel will share in this experience.  This is all a matter of exponential gain.  If you send out 10 letters, and the people that receive those letters rotate the names and send out 10 as well, then by the time your name has been rotated to the # 2 spot there will be 100 letters with your name on it.  The # 3 spot, 1000 letters.  As this pattern continues by the time your name reaches the # 4 spot, 10,000 people will send you One dollar just like the one you just received to total 10,000 dollars. 	Remember this will only cost you the amount of time it would take you to watch a stupid TV show.  I ask you now as a friend, just break routine for once.  If you do your part like those who have come before you, you will have 10,000 envelopes with one dollar bills delivered to your house.  I know it sounds so crazy but what if it works?  Wouldn’t it just be fun to have that to at least hope for.  If you break the pattern, you break your chance to feel the way I do right now knowing that I might have 10,000 dollars on its way to my house.  I sent my letters and I feel good about it.  I chose you because I thought you might feel the same.  Doesn’t everyone want free money?  -A Perfect Karma Document         Names and Addresses   1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Remember you have already received a dollar so the dollar you pay out to spot # 4 is covered.  The other ten dollars plus postage will be covered when you get your 10,000 dollars.  If spots on name/address list are left blank the letter is still new.  -Your total cost is $13.70, what would you normally waste 13 bucks on?-
