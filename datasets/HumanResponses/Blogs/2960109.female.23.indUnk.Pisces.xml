      Is anybody else excited about the after Easter candy sales at Wal-Mart, a.k.a. the Devil?

      Of course I day dream! Especially at night, but if I do it then, does it classify as a wet dream? Hmm, don't answer that :) However, I do agree with you, Hedish, when you guess that the guy could really be gay and staring at the spinach criussant (?) maker behind you. Let's face it, it is 2004.  Any who, most of my daydreaming used to involve whomever my crush was at that time, but I've since BROADENED my horizons to strangers :) (ha!) I mean, you never know what kinda lives some of them lead and I think it'd be great to imagine that they make lots of money and could easily spend all of it on myself---right? Call me gold digger, but I as you know, prefer the term--STRATEGIC, whatever.   Today, I'm back in the mode of looking for a job. I've had a few calls from friends telling me about this or that and then I've even found some on my own. Plus, I've realized that my computer moves much faster when all the icons on my screen DISAPPEAR---Hedish, I'm not going to restart it 'cuz I like it like this! I can still run aim and open up two windows! Ah-mazing!  By the way, I have an interview with Pulte Homes next week. Be sure and work your jelly on the prayers, thanks!

      It finally happened people! Finally, I felt a little something under the influence of alcohol! Two amaretto sours, two cherry vodka sours and one big, strong ass glass of Long Island Iced Tea was all it took :) Thanks to all of you fun fellas at Baker St. who made this all possible. I do appreciate your services and low prices of $1.25! I didn't notice anything 'til I was just about threw with my fourth drink.  I thought I'd stand up and walk over to the bar to order my fifth drink when I kinda realized that I was moving a bit slowly. Who knew that I could experience the Matrix right here in Houston, Texas?I  really just wanted to say, Ooooooooh, but I didn't want to tell my friend, Rachael, that all of her nagging and persuasion had finally worked and she had gotten to me. Bummer, yet another one of my streaks is over :( First driving illegally, now this! What next, sex? Grrrrrrr....  So we make it over to the bar, right, and I see one of my old classmates (as if the bar wasn't well-known for that already) and I decided to give him a hug... Why, why, why?! The blasted Matrix, I forgot! I could've sworn that my brain was floating in pudding 'cuz it took a few seconds for it to catch up to my actual motion? It's amazing my words even came out right now that I think about it.   Yeah, so I don't think I was drunk or anything, but I don't think I was buzzed either?? However, I was quite, QUITE sleepy. Man, I was sleepy. You know that kinda sleepy when it's all you want to do but for some odd reason you can't because of an interruption? Grrrrrrr.... that's the kinda sleepy five drinks makes me. Actually, that's the kinda sleepy that one big ass glass of LIT does to me. Boy, I tell ya when I got home---bless the sleep, people. Just bless it. I was knocked out before I even felt the cool air coming from my fan. Isn't that sad? Then that blasted mother of mine decided that 4 a.m. would be a great time to ask me the whereabouts of her CHANGE! What?! Are you insane? Grrr... Grrr... I do believe that some of the things they do to us just HAVE to be in some sort parental book somewhere because my level of patience with them is re-damn-diculous these days.   Oh YEAH! Any of you guys know someone who'd be interested in adopting a black chow/lab mix? She's the cutest thing you could ever lay your eyes on. She doesn't bark, not psycho and looks like she could hold the best conversation! We're looking everywhere we can to find her a good home but it's just not working. Although Paige enjoys the company and numerous amounts of tag, my parents think our yard is just not large enough for the two of them--HELP! Call/email me if you know somebody, kentesheia@hotmail.com!  Aren't you just loving our weather? God bless kite days!

      Oh my word, it's my night! Not only is basketball on, The Apprentice AND Will & Grace---but my FAVORITE Friends episode EVERRRRR! You know the one when Chandler says, "You can't go commando in another man's fatigues!" And then Joey says, "I hope I don't do any---LUNGES!" And THEN there's my all-time favorite line, "You were gonna drink the fat?" I love when Rachel says that!  I love this episode!

      Have you ever started a meal and while you're cooking it realized that you didn't want it anymore or didn't have enough ingredients to finish it? That's what I did today. In two seperate pots I was boiling chicken (both with two different choices of spices). I knew that I was gonna make some form of soup in one pot, but in the other I didn't know. I still don't know! It's just sitting there plain, floating with seasoning. I don't want chicken and rice, gumbo or another soup, but what?! grrrrrrrr! It really bothers me that I can't just go into the kitchen and whip something up! Why can't I ever make the same thing twice? I strike out miserably and hear a lot of  Oh, laaaaawwd, what is this?!  and my personal favorite...  Did you mean to use this much water?  Cook for your damn 'selves!    Freakin' adults! Quit complaining! grrrrrrrrrr...   With a taste of your lips I'm on a ride~You'r toxic, I'm slippin' under~  What comes after that? I tell ya, I think she's saying condom in there somewhere. I'm serious she says it. OH, and while I'm on the subject Newman, I'm with your mother on the whole Jesse thing! Give it a go, girl. I know he's not ur typical Asian by any means, but there aren't too many other guys who actually MEAN to have manners! Let's face it! Was it just me, or did anyone else think that he looked unbelievably suave whenever he'd put a hand in his pocket? Not to mention, that the blue shirt was totally working in his favor that night... He doesn't even have tattoos! What more do you need, woman?  Don't forget to tell him I say, Hi  :)  Even though I don't have my license yet, I took it upon myself to NAME 'my' gold 2003 Alero. What better name is there than, "OnTime"? Because that's what she is--on time! I'm HOPING that she's a sign to let me know I'm going in the right direction and things will soon start to happen for me. Interviews are finally popping up, even if some of them are for blasted temp agencies. Geez, I was at that place more than two hours! It wasn't too bad though, my sis used it as an opportunity for me to drive because apparently her 'knee' hurt----yeah, cuz she does enough activity for that to happen???   Hedish, have you been craving diet coke cake with whipped cream? I wonder if I could convince my family to eat that? Hell, I might as well be trying to feed them a salad or spinach :(

      Oh my word! I love Bank of America :) Everybody always complains about banks and how  The Man  is always out to get them. My experiences have taught me no different, but today was something all too new to me. Peep my scenario---  I deposited some money two days ago and I went back to check the balance. I had two totally different balances! The lesser of the two showed that I had $55 whoa, how on earth! So I went up to the bank today and talked to my good buddy, Olinda, who told me how  The Man , Balfour, was continuously trying to draw money outta my account even though there was  no  money in it! Do you know how many times they tried to do that damn transaction? 3 times!! How can they do that? Luckily for me, B.A. doesn't allow stuff like that when an account is already overdrawn, heh! (Ya'll know I can't balance a checkbook or anything else that involves commonsense. Boy, you should've seen my attempt at pumping gas a few minutes ago...  Hedish, don't make that face! I can see you from here!)  Anywho, since I was so nice to this lady and really just broke, she took the overdrafts off and gave me all of my money back! Isn't that just awesome! Gotta love the bank, don't ya?   What's this feeling of having some form of monetary status! I may just be able to buy my own Chipotle?? Which, mind you, is another reason why my overdrafts were taken off... Olinda eats there too :) I just thought I'd share in the glory.  Hedish, do you know that the managing editor of Texas City Sun emailed me back wanting to know if I could come in for an interview? That's great and all but the blasted place is an hour away... No job is that good! At least he looked at my resume :)   Newman I'll call you, provided I remember, about doing it up Downtown with you guys this weekend.   The sun isn't even shining today and I'm still feeling fabulous! Lord, let this good streak continue on to some form of employment or extended monetary status....

       When we sit and reminisce over you for real....  I really love this weather that we're having. Isn't it amazing? It's a great day for hide-n-go-seek, chinese freeze tag, or red light, green light. Bare with me as I have a childhood flashback...  Days like this in the summer, my brother, sister, cousins and I would be at my grandmother's house ripping and running up and down her street.  At the time, Grammy stayed on Teasdale, which has long been destroyed by Houston's floods, fires, drugs and violence by now.  At the end of her block was a dead end filled with woods, and we all convinced ourselves of a dead man or a boogie man coming to get us.  It never stopped us from playing kickball, dodgeball or basketball nonetheless.  I distinctly remember being terrified once when I fell off of my bike and thinking that this arm was gonna come out to get me if I stayed on the ground for too long! Boy we were some awful kids! We used to race alongside train tracks waiting for the railworkers to throw us some of their ice cold water filled in these tiny, plastic jugs. We'd try to drink as much of it as we possibly could before anybody saw us. I don't know why we even kept running after those trains in the first place 'cuz as soon as our moms got a hold of us we'd end up having to dump it all out anywayz. Our clothes would wind up being drenched and then dirty because we were too dumb to realize the dead giveaway we'd be making with saturated clothes. Since when do kids get so excited over water?  Man, those were great days!   Let's not forget about those times when we'd be playing and our parents would secretly be watching us.  Sometimes I'd turn my head to see them outta the corner of my eye and I'd hear them saying, "That's my baby!," and I'd wonder if they were talking about me.  My mom used to smile so big at we girls hoola-hooping and chiming, "Momma's in the kitchen cookin' fried chicken.." or "Ronald McDonald---(snap, snap)--a biscuit..." Ohhh, and let's not forget the way we figured out who'd be "it" for tag!  My all time favorites were, "Jack scratched a match..." and the one that always ended with, "...and you-are-not-it!" Yeah, who ever decided that that was a fair way of doing it? Apparently drawing sticks or playing rock, paper, scissors was just too damn civilized.  Always, always during the john BLAZEST part of the day, my grammy would cut up slices of watermelon and yell, "COME'n GET IT!" I don't care who's kid you were, but u knew what that meant! You could even be the newest kid on the block and still end up running in the same direction as the rest of us because you knew that whatever  it  was, you had to have it.  You always wanted to be the first one to  it  because you knew you could get dibs on the first piece.... the piece with the least amount of seeds, the reddest, the juiciest... the BIGGEST! Plus you knew that which ever piece you initally touched it was yours anyway 'cuz YOU touched it FIRST! It never really mattered how hard I ran for the first peice though. I could never beat my brother. I could never beat either of my cousins or the other boys. I was the smallest so I got 'bowed to the end of the line. But, be that as it may, I believed that the best was always the last peice because it was the one soaking in watermelon juice, so in actuality they did me a favor.  Yup, those days were great. Nowadays I look forward to being indoors when the sun is this bright because I don't like glistening skin or a dark forehead. I'm all backwards I know, but I'm a child of the A/C! I'm too big to be sweatin' my chocolate or smelling like a disaster... It's bad enough having to check the mail everyday! Just kidding :) I really love this weather. Days like this I feel like I can save the world or get a job. I mean, my problems aren't  really  problems and I know that 'cuz I smile everyday.  Alright that's enough of me trying to use my journalism degree. How was your day?

       After the party it's the...  parking lot?   Although my birthday was fun, my birthday's eve was wayyy better. There's nothing like a celebrity hanging out of the window saying, "Hey, how ya'll doin?" I must've laughed my ENTIRE birthday. Believe me, you would have too if you'd have come with me, my sister and my girl, Tera, to Sharpstown.  The outfits in there were.... on the re-damn-of-the-ridiculous! Almost as ridiculous as this boy 'dancing' on American Idol--- you know I can't stand bad dancers, right?  Anywho! My birthday! I saw girls in this mall/club walking around like they were working hard for the dollar.  I saw every pair of knock-off sneaker shoes with heels that I've ever wanted to see. There was just too much 'no ma'am!' going on! We're talking chocolate disasters, soup coolers, buckwheats live and in full effect---YOU NAME IT!    ~Club Max's~  I must say that I enjoyed the parking lot afterwards more than the club itself. Outside of the club we saw fountains of urination and cute fellas who still probably needed the meter stick before hopping on rides at Astroworld. Does anybody else hate that? Why are there so many short cuties? Be that as it may, I met one who I convinced to open up my car door---since he was kinda chillin on it, but whatever.  Inside the club? Oh my word! Damnit, I was cute and so were my girls! I ask you, why is that guys put on those blasted throwback jerseys or some damn shorts and expect girls to run over and salivate? I think guys should salivate over the fact that my legs were shaven, although it  was  only to the knee but whatever :) People, I saw a guy who had on wayy too much material! He had on diesel-like jeans, sneaks, a throwback Marino jersey (which I even questioned it's validity), underneath the jersey was another shirt, he had wristbands of different lengths and widths!, then the boy up and put on one of those fuzzy, white kangos---the damn kango SOMEHOW matched the walls of the booth we were sitting at. What on earth?   ~Club Skank~  Peep this, I'm getting my dance on in the club... I'm groovin... I hear my 'Tipsy' jam and I'm crunk... All of a sudden I look over and a bikini in stilettos is squattin' on the dance floor with her crew of half a dozen material-LESS! I tell ya, the biggest girl in the club could've had on a shirt with more material than all of their outfits combined! Ah-mazing! Awwww, and there was this poor lil' mixed girl (or maybe she was playing that off, too) who had on black hooker platforms, white biker shorts, and a black halter that didn't even HALT anything! Poor girl was really trying to work her magic, but I tell ya... she was so skank it just plain ol' stank :( Bummer!    ~Today~  I freaked out over this whole grad school/job thing. I took the practice GRE and I tell you I haven't seen grades that low since Botany when I was a freshman. Four-and-a-half years of college and only one semester of any kind of math proved disastrous! I refrain from telling you the score on my test. Hedish, bless you child for listening to my whining and iffyness. It's just that I'm just ready for a sign or THAT BLASTED SILVER LINING that reads 'your paid amount for this pay period is...'! Can you blame me?  I have an interview tomorrow for a company I know nothing about... someone remind me to get directions before noon.

       Disclaimer   It's my first day on the Blog and I'm excited! People, please bare with me as I find ways of using this. I'll more than likely use this page for random thoughts, sports highlights, and a menu of sorts. Most importantly, I'll try to leave any acts involving the family outta this.   Be That as it May  Would you believe that I have exercised twice already this week, while working on a possible third? Are the astrological signs pointing in my favor this week just because it's my birthday? Or does the Lord really know that I'm gonna need the extra stretching while I'm trying to drop it like it's hot on Saturday? Hmm...  I'm aiming for the second...    I Lost My Fire!   What happened to my days of motivation? I've become the motivatee instead of the motivator! Yesterday someone said to me, "Maybe you just don't want to work?" WHAT?! Me, not work? The girl who had three jobs two months ago? Are you mad? Is it true? My dramatizations here are really just for fun, but WOW it still makes me think. Clearly, there's more to life than me experimenting with how they make corndogs and realizing that dishwater makes my nails grow. Geez!   Anywho!  I just started my blogspot! Shot me a holla and let me know what u think!

      Oh, man I'm in a great mood. I'd love to just take credit for it myself, but I know that it actually came from the tiny terror herself, Ke`Yonna. Yup, she's here with us for the weekend and I'm flippin' excited about it. First of all, when she walked into our house today, she yelled and ran to me because I think that I am now her  favorite  aunt! And u know what? I didn't even have to put bacon in my pocket for that action. I think she likes me cuz I'm cool... OH YEAH, we're going to Kentucky!  For those of you who haven't already heard, I'm halfway caught up to normalcy... that's right, a valid driver's license! No more driving illegally for this kid, I'm saving up for the real deal now. I'm talking driving WITHOUT adult supervision... I'm talking driving beyond Grammy's house and the nearest FoodTown & Wal-Mart! Look out, people cuz I'm coming to a driveway near you :)   Alright, what's this biz about bathing suits? They're overrated. I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna run the men off before I even get started! Geez o' petes, now Hedish is talking about putting me in a bathing suit? Ew, is she mad?   I also regret to tell you all that Sassy is no longer, for the Lord giveth and taketh her away... for ever *_* She was bitten by a poisonous snake, which was later killed, but by the time her new owners found out, it was too late. My mom's really depressed because she knew she shouldn't have given her away, but nobody ever expected something of that nature to happen to her. Man, she was so cute... and the PERSONALITY! ...awful :(  Anybody up for Club Hush on Saturday? My cous is turning 30 and I tell ya she can still pass for 20 on any bad day. If you're up for it, let me know! ...hopefully, I won't be approached by any lesbian or cage dancer. No applause, thank you.  Have a great evening.

      I won't be able to make it out to Denton next week! I totally forgot that my sis is graduating on that same Saturday. Whoopsy there! I mean, the girl's only been talking about it for 8 months already. How on earth did I forget? Geez o' Petes, Hedish, I apologize. But you know I'll be there in spirit when you yell at your mother because she's trying to HELP you... Just imagine me laughing hysterically, okay? Sweet!  Annnnnnnnnnnnd, I'm half way to driving legally, people! I passed the written test and I sign up for the actual driving portion tomorrow. Eeeeeee! Look at me trying to get with the times? Get the heck outta the city, right? I know!   Quote of the Day --From me to Jason-- I'll have you know that kiwi isn't the only best tasting fruit with furr...   I'll let your little minds wonder for a bit on that one ^_^

      I almost forgot! For those of you who probably  already  knew... I'm a tad bit on the mean side. In efforts to make me 'whole' of sorts, Hedish has decided (I really told her) to be my 'therapist.' With that being said, I doubt that I'll ever enjoy Dirty Dancing, Grease 1 or 2, and West Side Story. Yeah, I still don't get how me not liking those movies makes me mean. I'm sorry but I prefer  Meet Me in St. Louis  and the Barbara Streisand oldies. Those are musicals. Those other things just suck to me.    Dirty Dancing  racks my brain beyond belief and  Grease  just gives me the heebie-jeebies. I can't stand either of the soundtracks. They make my skin crawl worse than only being left with country music stations on the way to Nacogdoches back in '99!! Heck, after stomaching those disasters, who's in the mood for West Side Story? Not to mention how many kudos were given to it. That guarantees how much I know I'm not gonna like it.    Ew.    What if I give you  Rent ? Did I gain some ground there?

      What's going on with the blasted Rockets?   I just don't get them! How on earth do you go through all of that just to lose the game in the end with an easy shot to Kobe? They really do make the Lakers look good. I was watching the game on Sunday and I called it before it even happened! I looked at my dad and said, "Now watch how Kobe wins them this game...he's gonna make a cut through everybody towards the basket." And sure enough, the little bastard just swoops through and gets the lay up! Uh-mazing! Are they intentionally trying to  try  my patience?!   And now I'm watching the Sacramento Kings who honestly are my favorite team in the NBA, but what on earth are they smokin'?! I'm sorry to say this, but they were better when Chris Webber was on the bench because right now I can't see him doing too much more than picking up some sticks! How dare they allow the Dallas Mavericks to think they could actually win this series?! MY WORD, they've included rookies in their starting lineup! The freakin' Mavericks even lose to the Spurs! Who loses to the Spurs?! Don't even get me started on that lame team either. I look at them like I do the New England Patriots...  when all of the big shots are gone, somebody has to win it.  That's right I said it! SO!    Go Kevin Garnett and the Timberwolves!  You were my pick from the beginning of the season anywayz!

I know, I know it's outta my character to not get up at 5:10a or 7:30a, but today I wanted to be a bum!   OH MY WORD! Little Peter on the Cosby Show is soooo cute! I love how when things get a little tough he just runs or maybe it's just a brisk walk of sorts? LOL, whatever :)  Have a great weekend everybody!

       IT'S STARTED!  The heat is here and I for one am not excited. It's 80 degrees everywhere, which means that it's time to see people wearing things they shouldn't be. It's time for those dazey dooks aka coochie cutters and other forms of gross displays of porcelain-kissing fashion! PEOPLE!  PEOPLE!!  Just because pink is the color of the season, doesn't mean it'll be YOUR color of the season, so stop the madness already. I want to see someone sporting orange or baby blue. Beat the system, geez! I don't wanna see rollie-pollie backs in halters and tube tops. I don't wanna see you in shorts just so you can floss the tattoo you got during your last drunken rampage! I don't wanna see you exposing your forearm or chest because you think that spiffy tribal symbol, barbed wire, or chinese letters is HOT! Stop using the summer as an opportunity to oil yourself down and show me your chest and back full of ridiculous amounts of TACO MEAT! Grrrrrrrrr! I can't wait til it rains!  Oh, and it's time for freakin' sandals aka straps of torture to be surrounded by crusty feet in need of yestermonth's pedicure, EW! Why on earth do we wear shoes with our feet hanging out knowing full well that we have jagged toe nails, a missing toe nail, a BROWN toe nail or only one toe nail with polish on it?! Grrrrrrrrr! It drives me insane! Damnit, what's wrong with wearing socks in the summer! Hell, buy some toe socks...INTENTIONALLY! And what's up with these people who have feet with layers and layers of ash/crust? Yeah, go ahead and make ur appointment for yesterday cuz that's ridiculous. I know we all have ash, but I'm talking about those exceptional cases where you just see the ash falling off of the foot while a person is WALKING! Come on, for the love of FRANK!  What about those blasted rugrats who run the streets and ring your doorbells and run! No, no don't make me get up and see no one standing at my door because this year if it happens, I'm calling for reinforcements... that's right---PAIGE! She hates kids anywayz. I tell ya, sometimes I wish I could carry a belt around for all the bad ass kids in the world and swat them whenever I felt like it. Get outta my yard!, SWAT! What'd you just say?, SWAT! I don't care who your mother is, SWAT! Kiss my grits!, SWAT! Oh my word, and somebody asked me how many, not to be confused with  IF  I had any kids... ARE YOU INSANE?  Oh, I'm sorry... my breasts are just big for no reason , but thanks for asking! Dirty old man. Grrrrrr!   I told you I was a cold weather gal ^_^

      How much longer 'til preseason starts? I can't take this madness! College basketball is over and who really gives a damn about the NBA Finals until the last few teams are dwindled down to almost nothing? I can't even watch hockey because I still don't know what "icing" means! Tiger lost the Masters... I can't tell ya what's going with tennis... why did Pete Sampras retire anywayz? ...When the hell are the Olympics starting?! I need a valid reason to wake up at 7:30 a.m. Yeah, I really do that :)  I wonder if the Olympics are hiring?    Speaking of Jobs  I have a second interview with Pulte on April 22nd! Thanks for those prayers, I really appreciate it. Unfortunately, I found out that I'd have to wait about two weeks before I hear anything back from Southwest Airlines. Grrrrrr! That's practially an eternity! What are they trying to do to me, geez.  Just for the record, how many times can one person watch, "Gangs of New York"? And I just want all of you to know that no matter how many times I watch it, I'm still not excited about this movie. What was up with that kiss anywayz? I mean, wouldn't that hurt? ...somebody puttin' they're teeth all on your face like that?! Ew!! Not to mention, what was up with ol' buddy swingin' at people with that butcher knife? Never once did I see him cook anything, but he's always aiming it at somebody. Weirdy!

      I've been waiting on this for months! Kevin Garnett on ESPN's "Beyond the Glory," oooooh, now he definitely knows how to quinch my thirst. Did ya'll see him? He's the epitamy of tall, dark and handsome. Ohh, and those pretty teeth! Where are guys like that in the 77065 region? My word, what does it take?! ...I wonder if he has any brothers?   ~Joyful, joyful Lord we adore thee! God of Glory, God of love!~  I went to my first Easter service at church today! I know, I know, a lot of you thought I'd have been already but I never have. I had a great time, lots of clapping and singing... I like it when the choir sings some of my favorite songs because it's a sure sign that I'm in the right place :) Not to mention that ol' buddy on the electric guit ah  was totally gettin' down! Who'd have known that Jimmy Hendrix woulda been representin' in the church house? :) Plus, I turned around to see one of my old SFA buddies--- yeah, that's another reassuring sign that I'm in the right place. Needless to say, I'm going again next Sunday. Plus, I'm up for wearing those fun clothes and heels in my closet, and no, I haven't worn my new blue flower skirt with shoes to match.   Jesse, if you ever read this---How you doin'? :)    ~The Lord giveth and He taketh away....~  Oh, yeah! We found a home for Sassy. I'm sure you're thinking, "sad day," right? Noooooo! The puppy was a tiny terror in disguise! She'd gotten to the point of wrecklessness. She'd look me dead in the face and randomly bark. What on earth was she smoking?! That's scary! It's bad enough that when she sat on the couch I could hardly see her. Then, she realized that she was big enough to jump on/off couches and beds! Grrrrrr.... She'd jump on my head and to pull my hair... noooo, not cute! PAINFUL! Needless to say, that lil' sporty got the boot and now has all the running room in the world on a lone Texas farm. Buenos Nachos to ya!   ~Antoine Straughter Update~  A few days ago I went to see Antoine and he's doing awesome. Doctors recently had done a surgery on him to drain fluid in his brain because it wasn't soaking up fluid as it should've been. They were a little nervous because they were unsure of how his progress would be because he had just started to talk, eat and do all sorts of little tasks on his own. Well, no longer are they worried! Kelsie called his mother the other day and she could hear Antoine talking loudly in the background. His mother even brought him clothes so he could practice putting them on. Heck, he's even brushing his teeth! So, keep the prayers coming because rehab is coming soon :)

      (Only if you know what happened this weekend would you know the true meaning behind that...)  Woo! My weekend is forever going down in history. I've been having so much fun since Friday and I'd like to tip my hat to Hedish and Newman for allowing me to share it with them all the days. Ladies, I am much abliged.   Friday and Saturday we busted out with the double-time at Club Drink; specifically, the 80s club ^_^ Seriously, nothing could ever beat any Old Man River doing interpretive dance while wearing yesteryear's abstract, reflective clothing. There's just something about them flinging their arms around and doing everything they can  not to  snake across the dance floor on their bellies. Then again, nothing beats Newman and Hedish trying to mimick them ^_~ Oh my word, you guys have no idea.  Ohh, and Hedish got hit on by some Clear Lake dude named Moses, a.k.a. the 'Chosen One'. He drives a Lexus and owns two houses. How does she know you ask? Oh no worries 'cuz he showed her the keys! Yeah, whatever. He'll never be close to Garr any day.  Zzzzzz!  GREENHOUSE! GREENHOUSE!  Hmm... you know who's fun people? Boys named Taustin, Danny, Chuck and Brian. Oh yeah, those boys bring a whoooooooole new meaning to " How's it hanging?"   I refrain from details at this time, however I am open to your more than likely accurate guesses.   Needless to say, I'm a fan of Memorial Day weekends, lake houses, boys who spit-spell their names, 'improvision' car bombs, the human anatomy, and anything else non-Kentesheia.

      (You all should really ask Hedish to do that for you ^_^)  Tuesday at 7 a.m. is the day of reckoning! That's the day I'll be taking my road test. If ya see a busted Neon rollin' past ya on 290, be weary.  Ohh, and I'll be sure to give you all the news on what happened at the Singles shin-dig. It should be a doozy!  Have a great weekend  err body!

      My sis just got me a celly. Who's excited? Hell, I know YOU are 'cuz clearly it, as with my license, has been a long time coming! A looooooooong time coming. So, yay. Don't ask me what the number is... chances are I'll end up asking YOU what it is because I don't know ^_^ Bare with me as I take a step into the latest century.  Today I 'swam'. I use the quotes because I've never tried swimming by myself without the assistance of some form of a floaty. I was over at Hedish's and I just kinda kicked a little and tried to tred water. Yeah, I don't understand that too much either but at least I wandered out into the 'deep' end without freaking out. Yet another, yay ^_^ Oh, and you know what else? I used sunscreen on my face today and I had no allergic reaction! Now anybody who knows me will tell you that any substance or slobber on my face will cause a massive breakout, but leave it to Hedish 'Not Marie' to suggest me using  baby  sunscreen. Yay!    Just for record, you know in case you really wanna know--My hair is smelling DAMN great right now ^_~ Fantastically,  UH -mazing!

      Did you guys see American Idol tonight? Seriously, people,  I  almost started crying. It was just that great. Fantasia, Fantasia, Fantasia! When the girl sings you're either crying because she makes you feel happy or you're crying because she can just take you there. The girl is seriously gonna go down in history as one of the greatest... she's only 19! Uh-mazing! I hope she wins, but it's no shocker if America chooses Diana Degarmo, she'll have a nice two-year carpet ride.  Can I say how excited I am about my Stevens/FKM (FogartyKleinMonroe) public relations summer internship interview? Yeah, I am! Do ya know how long it's been since I've written a press release or even used that side of my brain? The good news is that it's only 20 minutes away. The bad news is that I'm getting paid  just  enough to maintain enough gas for a 20 minute car ride :/   But, did I mention that I'd be at FogartyKleinMonroe ^_^

      That means  How are you?  in Japanese! Or better yet, you could just say  "Genki"?   It sounds like "What's up?" or "Howdy?".  I'm flippin' excited about finding this site! Ya gotta love any of my attempts to break down those blasted language barriers ^_^ Okay, so New Man has Spanish, so I'm thinking I can have Japanese. Let's see how long I can hang in there with this.   Days of the Week!   Monday = getsu youbi Tuesday = ka youbi Wednesday = sui youbi Thursday = moku youbi Friday = kin youbi Saturday = do youbi Sunday = nichi youbi    Is it me, or is something telling you that  youbi  must mean day?

      Is it me, or do you just love when your grandparents come over? I do! She hardly ever makes it out this far and I think it's great--especially since she's cooking today! She's making her famous beans, cabbage and potato salad. One could only hope for her cornbread... (can you feel me praying that she finds the cornmeal and flour in our kitchen?)  Any who! I recommend you people try her food once before you kick the bucket ^_^

      Okay, so I finally decide to take one of those 'personality, love' tests and my results! Oh my results! I don't know if I should feel happy or sad about them. I'm happy that they're amazingly accurate and i'm sad that they are... amazingly accurate? So without further ado, here they are:  THE PRISS (Deliberate, Brutal, Love, Dreamer)   Deliberate  as in I take my time to break things down and make a decision.  Brutal  because I'm more selfish than most and selectively moral.  Love  is my primary motivation, duh?  Dreamer  because I'm relatively innocent, unjaded, possessing undiscovered talent (sex?) and evolving.   Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic.  Excuse me.  The Priss.       Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy.       These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards.   You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing.  Always Avoid:  The Playboy, The Loverboy... and if any of you know me at all, they're the ones who I seem to be the MOST attracted to. Awful! The 'sytem' recommends I consider The Manchild... is that similar to a  Manwhore?  I'm just wondering...  Aren't those results amazing? You know as you read that you're saying to yourself, "Yup! That's Kentesheia." Trust me, I know.  Oh it gets worse! My exact opposite is a person who is random, gentle, highly into sex, and a 'master' meaning basically educated. Now if that doesn't make me seem boring AND prude, I don't know what does?

      Today I went to my friend, Merrilee's house because she was having another one of her famous cook-outs. The girl can't just cook bbq chicken, pork, or beef and just stop. She has to have grilled salmon, corn on the cob, baked beans, different salads, different deserts, your preferences of store bought or homemade bbq sauce, guacamole, salsa, etc. etc. It's insane how ahmazing she is in the kitchen! Yeah, I'm sure you're thinking that's a lot of food for a lot of people, right? No, no! Even if you come over to her house on a Tuesday, she'll make you the same thing if not something more and/or better! And you have to watch her too because if you tell her that you're taking home ONE dish, she'll slip the rest of the leftovers into your container or onto your plate.  Oh, her family is absolutely marvelous! They kept me laughing the entire time. You know how sometimes you'll go to someone's bbq and you'll feel uneasy because you're in a room full of strangers? Ohh, that soooo doesn't apply when her family comes around. They use it as an opportunity to bust out some of their latest jokes and pervertedness. I loved it!  The best part of the evening was when I got to hold Merrilee's son, Carter! Ohhhh, my word! He has red hair that you can only see if he's angled a certain way, and these big, GORGEOUS blue eyes that make you want to stare at him ALL DAY LONG! Oh my word, and those little chubby calfs... I just wanted to nibble on 'em because he smelt so good. What a cutie he is!  Me thinks me want one? or two, or three?         Later, of course ^_~

      Just a few minutes ago, I was gung-ho about sitting on top of my soap box and releasing so much of my pent up energy. But then I thought about it and I wasn't in the mood anymore. Maybe I'll save it for Maury Povich or Dr. Phil at a later date? It's not like my family troubles aren't going anywhere anywayz, right?  I don't know what the deal is, but I've been unable to sleep all week long. Am I missing something? It's not like I take naps anymore, so you'd think I'd be tired, right? Wrong! I'm up! Like, 'up' meaning, I should be doing something with my time? Should I be praying? Am I up bc of some health reason? What on earth! This is why I take naps during the day. At least then my total hours of sleep would come close to the suggested eight hours bc otherwise I don't think I'd get them.  Since Newman gave me kudos twice on her blog, I'm going to politely return the favor. Thanks, thanks so much for being entertainment when I need to be preoccupied from other things. Thanks, too, for more grad school ideas and encouragement. Do you know that my only experience of UH was driving through it? Amazing!   Oh, Hedish! Paul called me today and apparently he and his 'crew' were subjects of "The Top 10 Finest Criolos in Brockton (MA)" on some Cape Verdean chat room in his hometown. Yup, their names were all over it. Didn't I tell you this boy was gorgeous? I mean, when people start talking about you over the Internet, we're talking serious bidness! He's told me about his boys before and their experiences when they go out, but oh my word is that how it goes...  really?  Awww, and the poor guy is so bashful and at a loss for words over it. He's like, " I mean, I knew I wasn't ugly, but... " My favorite quote from someone in the chat room--"Hell, the whole damn Fortes family is fine! Both sexes." LOL, insane, but very true ^_^

      Julie Ramirez and her fun roomie, Allison, came to see me today; in spite of the blasted Houston rain. I love little surprises like that ^_^ It's a bummer that her bro won't be able to make it to her graduation, though.  It's expected to rain here for the next three days?! WHAT! Rumor has it that a tornado hit on Eldridge near the new Wal-Mart. That's a little too close to my home, people and I really don't feel like being on t.v. so if that wouldn't happen again, that'd be grrrrrreat!   You know what's fun, people? Hanging out with good ol' Hedish and 'nem. I tell ya it's something when I get yelled at for not helping to wash the dishes and for not cleaning my room.    Slang of the Day:   T-ninety or T-Nutchy (if you're from 5th Ward)    a little bit , as in  slibber , ha! EXAMPLE--I ask my dad if he'd like some Kool-Aid. As a response he'd most likely reply, "Oh, just t-ninety."

      I don't know what's going on with people these days. Yesterday was such a great day! I went to my cousin's surprise crawfish boil party and I had a great time... mainly because a certain cutie named Taha was there but on whatever. How can you go from having such a great day/morning (bc we got in around 4am) to a piece of shit morning?!   Allow me to explain:  My sis and I were on the way to the Connor's residence when a PIECE OF SHIT suburban side swiped us. People, when I tell you I was hotter than fish grease I mean it. I was looking for one of those backwoods, galosh wearing, trailor home Tomball bastards to say some shit to me, I REALLY was furious.  Earlier when the truck rolled passed us, I thought to myself (and my sis did it at the same time!), "Now, who would pay for that piece of shit?" because they had writing on their vehilce in shoe polish for someone to buy it. We pull onto the back street to take the 'shortcut' through our neighborhood when this bastard is clearly STOPPED on the other side of the street. There were no blinkers! There was no movement, nor any other type of motion for that matter! As we're riding passed them this asshole hits us! WHAT THE F*#@! I'm so mad, that I just get outta the car and immediately walk to my house and get my parents. While I'm leaving I see these assholes double team my sis and tell her it's her fault!   I call the cops bc something tells me these people are not legit and capable of anything. YEAH, they turned out to be just that. Mr. Mullet aka Redneck asshole points at me, TO MY PARENTS, and says that I was the one driving!!! Are you insane???! First of all, don't lie on me because bitch, you don't know me. Second of all, I don't have a license and have been banned from all forms of driving by my father. THIRD and most important---- BITCH ARE YOU CRAZY?!  Don't play with me.  Is that not insane? No no, wait, my story gets better!  Mr. Fife finally decides to roll around and I see right off the bat that he could give a hot damn about me or the accident. He got a little snappy with me because the location he was told was incorrent. Well, sorry, blame it on your operator bc she cut me off before I could finish... I could've sworn part of their job was to LISTEN but whatever, who was asking me? Any who, I noticed the obvious chip on this guy's shoulder and walk up to my parents and tell them that the cop's an asshole. In fact, he's so much of an asshole that he believed the hick when he told him that I drove. Oh hell no!   Did I forget to tell you all how there was a witness? As soon as we were hit, I looked up and saw this lady standing there getting groceries outta her trunk, but do you think she helped out in any kind of way? NOPE! She went into her house, let down her garage, closed her blinds and said, "She didn't wanna be involved." You piece of weak shit! ...ten fold people, ten fold!  The cop that we unfortunately received had it out for us from the beginning and if you're thinking that I'm gonna pull the 'race card' here you're damn skippy bc you have no idea just how much he belittled me, my sister, my mother and my father. Excuse me, but in order to get respect you must give it. Fuck you and your got'damn badge. He looked at me and goes, "What do you have to gain by saying that you didn't drive?" What! Excuse me? That's a crooked question and he was looking for a crooked answer. My parents and I looked at each other, threw our hands up bc we knew we were fighting a losing battle. We never even had a chance before we started.   Another fabulous thing is that the Tomball hicks handed over a nonexistent form of insurance... Is anybody else not surprised by that one? They NEVER had insurance... lying ass cop! I just don't believe it. I hate the feeling of being had and I hate the feeling of being able to do nothing about it. What goes around comes around and I'm wishing for ten fold, people.  ...i'm fine, don't worry.

      I found Sesame Street's 'We All Sing with the Same Voice' lyrics! Yay, yayyyy!   My hair is black and red  My hair is yellow  My eyes are brown and green and blue   My name is Jack and Fred  My name's Amanda Sue  I'm called Kareem Abdul  My name is you   I live in southern France  I'm from a Texas ranch  I come from Mecca and Peru  I live across the street  In the mountains, on a beach  I come from everywhere  And my name is you   We all sing with the same voice  The same song, the same voice  We all sing with the same voice  And we sing in harmony   Sometimes I get mad and mean  Sometimes I feel happy  And when I want to cry, I do   When I'm by myself at night  I hold my teddy tight  Until the morning light  My name is you   I have sisters one, two, three  In my family there's just me  I've got one daddy  I've got two   Grandpa helps me cross the street  My cat walks on furry feet  I love my parakeet  My name is you   We all sing with the same voice  The same song, the same voice  We all sing with the same voice  And we sing in harmony   I like to run and climb  I like to sit and read  I like to watch my TV, too   And when it's time for bed  I like my stories read  "Sweet dreams" and "Love you" said  My name is you   We all sing with the same voice  The same song, the same voice  We all sing with the same voice  And we sing in harmony

       A HOUSTON ROCKET ! The Rockets just gave away their entire team by getting rid of Cutino, Stevie Franchise and Cato. What on earth! I'm all about McGrady being a Rocket 'cuz yeah have u seen him? The man's on fire! His scoring is off the chains! Those looks aren't so bad either ^_~  How dare the Magic criticize him for not making them 'better.' How was he supposed to make a losing team better? Is he supposed to pass the ball to a butterfinger team player whenever he clearly has the open shot? Was he not supposed to draw fouls underneath the basket because he knew no one else on his team was capable of doing such a thing? WHAT! I give the whole management team THE FIST!  They act like the boy is Kobe Bryant or something... His stats were on the up and up regardless of how that team was playing.   Here's a good question -- Now what are the Rockets supposed to do with Yao Ming? T-Mac's a powerhouse and sometimes I wonder if Yao's even got a lighthouse, geez.   This should be one interesting season.  Listen to Outkast's  urlLink Bowtie  'cuz I LOVE IT ^_^

      That's right, I'm having ice cream for breakfast and pretty dang proud of it! But you know what's for lunch? A Freebirds burrito, or as Ke`Yonna would say -- BUH-leeto! Not to worry though, this location isn't near as good as the one in College Station. They're tomatoes were runny and the pico was yuck-o. I felt bad cuz that was my bro's first time to go and that left an effect on his tummy if ya know what I mean. He thought he was The Man and decided to order a monstersized BUH-leeto. He ate more than half of it, but threw in the towel not long after. Next time, he won't eat a meal before he goes.  Saturday, Saturday, Saturday :/ Mrs. Hafford's funeral. I'm not gonna speak too much about it 'cuz it's more than I can bear at times.   You know how a lot of comedians, movies, what have you, make fun of those southern-styled funerals where someone always falls out and runs up to the casket? Well, that was me. I almost passed out in the parking lot and inside the church (twice) because it was hard to breathe through my tears. I hadn't cried all week long and it all kinda came to a head once we were standing at the entrance of the church. I saw a few SFA football players (best friends of her youngest son) and they started talking and I could just see the pain on their faces.   Crock sped in from San Antonio 'cuz he had just gotten word that morning. Braylo just stood there shaking his head over and over again. Poor Trot just looked like he was completely outta tears. Although they didn't say it, after they viewed the casket, I knew they all sat down in Crock's car and broke down one final time together.  On the way up to Jasper, I felt nautious on an empty stomach, so I knew I was bound to break at some point -- it actually ended up being several points.   I wasn't for sure how long my sister was stuck on staying, but I'm so happy we were invited out to the house. Believe it or not, that WAS a big deal bc many people who they'd known for years were kinda turned away that afternoon. Mr. Hafford asked me to sit down for some friendly conversation and I must say that it felt good to be in his company again ^_^  Sunday! Don't you just love it when you go to church and the service seems to be ALL about you? Or better yet, someone you know? We had a guest speaker and he used a great little analogy of how fish 25 feet below a hurricane/whatever aren't affected by the storm happening above the water. He went on to talk about how finding  perfect  peace within a storm is possible and how we all should aim for 25 feet instead of 24... I TELL YOU PEOPLE, it was great!   I'm sending the tape to Mr. Hafford because his faith is being tested like never before and every little bit helps, right?  Oh my word! Oh my word! You're not gonna believe what I just found! I'm so excited ^_^  urlLink Listen!  Alright, but if you want a new diddy here's  urlLink Maybe  by N.E.R.D.

      *sigh*  I'm watchin' my BET, my MTV and I see Usher slidin' across my screen. Is it me, or is that boy in dire need of a 'clean up?' Seriously, I'm sittin' there and I have this look of disgust on my face because I'm disappointed that Usher made yet another crappy video! These songs are supposed hits and you'd think that their videos would be slammin' right? WRONG!   What was up with the 'Burn' video? Just 'cuz the title implies 'fire' doesn't mean you should necessarily include it in your video! I mean, at least have somebody crying! Did you see Usher or anybody else crying in that video? Is the song not about pain, problems and heartbreak? For the love of pete why didn't somebody ask me about the concept before they shot this dadgum thing? Geez!  And I'm sorry Usher, but I, too, have a confession to make... I didn't like either of your songs when I first heard them. Why? Has anybody noticed how the boy just has a  problem  being faithful? In "Yeah!" he was eyeing some other chick. In "Burn" he had a girl, but --- ya'll know the story. And now there's "Confessions Pt. II"   Can we say 'unfaithful?' Better yet, can we say 'Chilli?'   -- but maybe that's just me?   Even if the song isn't about Usher, who is he associating himself with so that this kinda stuff does actually happen? Hey, how about  birds of a feather flock together ? Um-hmm.   I don't know. I'm just upset that the boy was in the video attempting a generic version of 'How Does it Feel (Untitled)' by D'Angelo. No, no, don't walk around with your shirt off like we ladies are supposed to swoon. I don't even want to see Usher in a tank top. Any NFL or NBA athlete would put that little thing of his to shame. If he knew any better he'd already know that we ladies naturally 'swoon' over a bowl of ice cream.   Have you seen the part where Usher sits on top of a piano?? The piano has NO legs!  WHAT!  Those things cost money! Boy, you better find a good chair like most people and quit trippin'!  Did I tell ya how a little 9-year-old cutie had eyes for me tonight during bible study? Oh yeah. And to think, maybe if I'd have gussied up a little more I could've gotten his older brother ^_^  Tonight's Listen is  urlLink Pieces of Me  by Ashlee Simpson, and yes, I know the words.

      What on earth is the deal with this weather? Is it me, or would it seriously be about the same temperature even if it hadn't have been raining? My skin's been glistening for two weeks now! Geez! I know, I know, somewhere somebody's really wanting some rain, but you know what I have to say to that person? Move to Houston, then you'dget all of the rain you ever hoped for -- plus some!   This typical Houston weather is killing me. How is anybody supposed to feel happy given these circumstances? Oh wait! I know who does, that lady from El Paso who hit that flaming jackpot. Do you know that the store that sold the winning ticket gets a cut of her money? The convenience store employees are splitting over one million dollars!  Hmmm, how about $20 is sounding pretty good right about now?  Don't act like that's just me. Ya'll are greedy too!   Today's Listen is  urlLink Move Ya Body  by Nina Sky.   This one beat alone has been used by three separate artists and ya know what?! I love them all! There's even a latin version. I don't know what the hell those cats are saying, but I  DO  know that I'll be John Brown if I just hold the wall and refuse to dance! Every time I hear either of the songs I just want to thunder clap or something-- Hedish, have no worries, I'll teach you that dance later.   OH man, let me tell ya! I was listening to the radio while I was 'working,' and I heard someone blasting the Ying-Yang Twins outdoors. Clearly, I thought it was just someone who left their car unattended, but NOPE! It was the Vato builders next door! They were jammin' to  Shake it Like a Salt Shaka!  Don't ask me why, but it just made me so happy! I started laughing! I wanted to go out there and be like,  NO SH*T, get it! , however I refrained. But, if they'd have busted out with some Kanye West, we could have really been friends for real! *wink*  Maybe this rain isn't so bad?  Soooo, I get off at six, right? Well, the old lady's picking me up. I'd be crazy to think that she'd actually be here straight up AT six o'clock. If she's here by 7p,  then  I'll congratulate her on timeliness. The lady just seems to have her own agenda about things. The other day she was going 55 in a 70 and then went 25 in a 40. Don't ask me why, but neighborhoods we go through all day, every day, she'll look at them like they're brand new making all sorts of 'new-to-her' commentary that I've had the pleasure of hearing since about '76... Mind you that I was born in '81 but whatever. She had me concerned for a minute because she couldn't quite decipher the difference between the Beltway and 45 and then it hit me.  Do I even know the difference between the Beltway and 45?  :/ I knew I got this crap from somewhere! Thankx mom for your swell, yet odd, qualities. Did I tell you how she doesn't pump her own gas? Yeah, my dad does it FOR her!   So what I'm trying to say is -- for all of my lovely friends out there, don't keep looking at me foul 'cuz I've never pumped gas or because it took me getting a license at 23 to finally do it! I get it from my MOTHER!  She get it from her mama -- WHAT? -- She get it from her mama ^_^  Is anyone else laughing, or are you shaking your heads in sadness  for  me, right about now? I crack me up!

      What up Ginas? I'm at the good ol' work place. I would tell you where it is, but I'm afraid that after I tell ya I won't be working. You know, with me and my luck of three day employers...  Oh guess what's on the radio? Marshall, err, PRINCE!     I don't want pressure you, baby but all i ever wanted to do I wanna be your lover!    I love getting paid to chill.

      I thought I could beat the system. Nope. I'm basically the same thing. Even on a day like today! I take their test again and now I'm a Wild Rose. No, no! Roses have thorns! This can't be good...   Colorful, but unpicked. You are The Wild Rose.   Prone to bouts of cynicism, sarcasm, and thorns, you excite a certain kind of man. Hoping to gather you up, he flirts and winks and asks you out, ultimately professing his love. Then you make him bleed. Why? Because you're the rare, independent, self-sufficient kind of woman who does want love, but not from a weakling.   You don't seem to take yourself too seriously, and that's refreshing. You aren't uptight; you don't over-plan. Romance-wise, sex isn't a top priority--a true relationship would be preferable. For your age, you haven't had a lot of bonafide love experience, though, and this kind of gets to the core of the issue. You're very selective.   The problem is them, not you, right? You have lofty standards that few measure up to. You're out there all right, but not to be picked up by just anyone.      "You're never truly single as long as you have yourself."      ALWAYS AVOID:  The Bachelor    CONSIDER:  The Vapor Trail   Basically, I need to find myself a small town boy with an accent or some mute who won't give me lip! Who do you guys know? Tell him to shot me a holla ^_^  Just for the record, I really do like the "Pieces of Me" by Ashlee Simpson. I LOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!

      What am I supposed to do? There's no point in me even turning on my t.v. anymore. Do they really expect for me to watch  baseball ?  Are you kidding me?  Who watches baseball?! No, no, you watch  The World Series , but no one watches baseball on t.v.!   Do they? *sniffle*  How many months do I have until the next  real  sport starts? Say, like football? Let me see men in tights workin' it like no other ^_~ Oh, that's what I'm stressing. Sometimes I wish I had a quarter to thump off of every nice pair of....   I can't take this madness. That's why it's called America's Favorite Past Time... 'cuz it PASSES THE TIME AWAY while you're waiting for another sport! No, no, that's not genius thinking! People, that's a damn shame and I, for one, am not happy about it.        Hedish, now there's a tear in my eye.

      Ke`Yonna Monet, Jr. stayed with us last night! The little thing was so cute walking 'round the house in a mock Celtics knock-off jersey and she had on these little, green Chuck Taylor's to match. She's so flippin' cute! Then today I got to brush her teeth, wash her face, clean her crustyfied nose, spray her with perfume and change her clothes... Does anyone see where I  could  be going with this? Can I just use the excuse that maybe I missed her a lot?  Yeah....   Might I also say that I felt a little  badly  for the Lakers last night? I know, I know, a person can't go changing feelings like this, but Kobe Bryant was trying everything he could to spark something and failed miserably. The guy is just-so-damn-pretty! I can't stand looking at his beauty going to waste. The Lakers could have sent the game into overtime if they'd have made half of their missed free throws... but, be that as it may--    Go Larry Brown! Go Rip Hamilton! Go Rasheed Wallace! Go Pistons!    Today is a damn good day (even with that dumbass standing on top of a utility pole)! I really feel good. I'm gonna do pilates on my own as soon as I finish this. I've already talked to Newman... she replied! I'm cooking spaghetti today... maybe even making a cake. I want Hedish's sauce from HEB... Hi CMC (that rhymes)! And you know what else?? I  might  just shave my legs today.... Ohh, can you hear the walls tumbling down?!   I feel the earth MOVE under my feet I feel the sky tum-ba-lin' down, TUM-BA-LIN' down!   UH-mazing!   I'm feeling a really good forecast of Sister Act 2 by 2 o'clock ^_^

      Nothing beats a little Kanye West and Hedish to get your body moving with pilates. Gosh, I can't wait to go to sleep after this! I know, I know, when you do some form of exercise you're supposed to get a snack and do some form of activity afterwards, but who cares! We're going to sleep in a little bit! Whoa, whoa! Everybody missed it this morning! She actually cooked for us this morning... with  real  ingredients... with a  real  recipe... and of course, no meat, but I improvised by filling up with an extra glass of orange juice ^_^ Thanks, man!  Alright, alright! I don't know about you guys but I'm itchin' for all of this goody-goody Reagan talk to be over. I'm ready to get down to the nitty-gritty on this man and his 'true' politics. I'm ready for everyone to stop walking on egg shells and trying to fluff him up. Let's talk about the real headliners this man made. I mean, nobody on this earth is that damn great. I'm, not trying to be heartless but COME ON! Are we stupid? Let's not forget that he was a PRESIDENT! They're all dirty! Oh, wait. I told my bible study teacher that I would stop viewing all politics as evil, but can I start that reasoning  tomorrow  because as of right now I'm one step towards pissed. Seriously, if I hear/see one more recording of "...Mr. --, tear down that (Berlin) wall...", I'm gonna fall over. I mean, how much of that was really his doing? I'm just saying. People straighten up your backs and let's get back to figuring out what we're gonna do about Bush.   Hey, if you're pissed at me right now, BE PISSED! I don't care. It's not swaying my decision on any of my past experiences with 'American History.' Gosh, I hate our onesided version of history. History for me was always forced in research projects during the month of February, or maybe that was just Cy-Fair ISD?  So pardon me if I find some gratification from Reagan's casket being carried by any minority... especially my own. But, to each is own and do as you will.  urlLink Always speak well of the dead, or be quiet.  And, no, I felt this way before I read this article and countless other articles and texts.  I'm cool with only one Pres and that's Clinton. That's mainly because of all of his shit was put in the street and it wasn't an option to 'run.' I don't get the big deal anywayz. It's not like it's Watergate! What's this man's main controversy? Sluttin'! That's it. No one else talks about anything else he did, or how well he dit it, or even how horrible he did it. People only care about where he decided to stick that penis of his. Frankly that's none of anyone's business and has crap to do with the concerns of our government. All it does reinforce, however, is America's obsession with trying to make someone else's business, their business.    I can't wait for Clinton to come on Oprah next week! It's gonna be one of the greatest things I've seen. Ya know---since last week's interview with George Michael ^_^

      Sorry guys, I couldn't resist!  My good buddy, Paul (not to be confused with the Upstate cutie) was having a horrible day yesterday and that was just a tid bit of his invitation-only pity party. His body had grown weary and all of the negative that goes with any sales job were starting to get to him. Luckily for him, tomorrow always brings signs of new business and second chances so he SOLD! Good job on the sales today! Remember, if ya make it past this week you can make it 'til the end! Fo' shizzle my nizzle ^_~  Anywho! I haven't heard an old timey saying like that since my Grammy said, "Well, close my mouth with a clothespin and tell me to cluck with the chickens..." Uh-mazing! Where do people come up with these things? I can't wait 'til I start saying stuff like that! Can you? Oooooh!  Sooooo, I'm watching the Laker/Pistons game... I see Luke Walton... son of Bill Walton, basketball hall of famer and THE most annoying commentator.... EVERRRRRRR!... and I then the cameras cut to Bill's wife... yeah, I'm sorry, but don't most children resemble their mothers? Seriously, don't they? Not Luke Walton! If it weren't for his tatoos and odd antics, he wouldn't resemble EITHER parent! He's the son of a small asian lady! I mean, how the hell is he light-eyed and over six feet tall? Please somebody 'splain that to me. This baffled chick would really like to know. And I don't wanna hear any of that, "Well maybe his DNA skipped a generation..." The boy's adopted.  Did anyone else see Stevie Wonder driving on Oprah today?? With two of his closest blind friends??! Did you see how he was driving a Mayback?  A MAYBACK!  What Oprah forgot to mention is that she was the one who bought Stevie the car. Oh yeah, bet'cha didn't know that! And ya know what else? He isn't truly blind (or maybe that was a joke and I missed it?). Apparently those shades of his are a facade of sorts? Oooh, sneaky my friend, but how I do like it ^_~   RANDOM COMMENTARY:   Why's my mom calling Paige fat?   Sorry about Rocky and the case of the bad ass dog.  Apparently the best thing in Monterrey isn't their jack cheese, huh, Newman?   Rumble.   And is it me, or could one only imagine that the movie following, Scary Movie's "White Chicks" will be titled  Black Folks ?   I'm just saying.

                 I won tickets to the Prince concert!          His FINAL concert everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!      Everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!             He's performing his greatest hits! All in ONE night! I'm tellin' ya that if this man plays 'Insatiable' or 'Adore' I'm PERSONALLY blowin' the place up.  Rumor has it that Sheila E. will be his guest for the evening. And I'm tellin' you people that if she sings/plays 'The Glamorous Life' -- I'm blowin' the place up.... twice! This is serious bidness. Sheila E. AND Prince in the SAME night?! What?! Oh my word!  I won the tickets courtesy of the radio. For the love of Frank, so many of my people were trying all week to be the 16th caller! I was losing my mind because the phone would ring and then I'd be cut off 'cuz I wasn't the right caller. Just when I thought I'd given up, I called again and the dj answered.... Alright, in my own defense, I'll tell ya that I understand why some people lose thier minds on the radio. One, we like  free  stuff. Two, we try really hard to be  that  caller and when we finally get through it's unbelievable. Lastly, it's a concert to see   P R I N C E   !  I think for that last reason alone I should be excused for my manners on air. I just do.  Oh my word, I think I'm capable of crying at this concert. Like, 100%, ugly, Oprah cry. This guy is the mecca! The buck begins and stops with this man. For the love of Pete, he wore ass-less pants! Look at those sideburns! The freakin' stilettos! The tight pants and the ruffly shirt that has taco meat hangin' outta the front!  And ya know I have to buy a concert T-shirt?!   Oh, yeah I do!    Seriously, don't call me 'cuz I'm just gonna talk about this concert all day! Screw finding a job. I have to worry about a new outfit, plus new heels! My hair! What if I end up sitting next to a straight, available, ATTRACTIVE man that doesn't look hungry? Oh my word. Oh my word.  I can't believe it.       Hedish can you believe that we're going to be in the same building as Prince and Sheila E.??????!        We didn't have to pay $400 for it E I T H E R !!!!!!!!!

      I think I have a job? A real job? Better yet, a  career ? One that pays bi-weekly and has benefits? One that involves me doing actual -- oh, how do you say it -- work. I called&nbsp;up the local paper and&nbsp;they need a reporter badly. Being that I&nbsp;do have a degree in that area it's&nbsp;mine all mine!&nbsp;I don't even have to worry about having a camera (Although my mom said she's thinking of buying me one, what? I wonder who told her about it at her  JOB  'cuz we all know the woman has problems with her cell phone and the answering machine?).&nbsp;We'll hold out on the camera 'cuz after all I need a&nbsp;car, hello! People, cross your fingers for no Accent, Neon or Sentra. Sorry, if you drive those, but I don't fancy 'em.&nbsp;This chick needs some room and a car that&nbsp;won't dent easily.&nbsp;Somewhere I hear&nbsp;Hedish saying, "They all dent!" But, I'm just gonna believe that even without her aspiring&nbsp;Master's she still knows what&nbsp;I mean. I love ya, girl!   Oh, I almost forgot to&nbsp;tell ya that I drove MYself to&nbsp;two&nbsp;interviews! Yeah, yeah, it was up the road 20 minutes, but that's H U G E in my book and ya know it. Might&nbsp;I also say that I wrecked shop with a 1500 Dodge truck a few days ago? Ohhhh, the road was so mine.&nbsp;That's what I'm talking about. A truck. No Neon or Sentra! I was all over 610 and I-10 with that bad boy. I only ran over one curb and hit one pot hole, but who cares! I brought it back with no visible scratches or dings. You think my cousin will let me drive it again? Hell, I would  ^_^  Do it.   Seriously, let's pray about this Accent biz. No good. What about that Alero I kindly picked out? Yeah.   Any who... I almost&nbsp;fell through our window today. Yup, that would be&nbsp;after the good ol'&nbsp;Paige, dear, knocked me outta this&nbsp;computer chair and on the floor. I wasn't playing with her and that blasted tennis ball, so she retaliated by jumping on me and pushing me backwards. My shoulder hit the ledge and I was pissed. I said the F-word. I knew she'd get me one day.&nbsp;...see if I feed her later... Just kidding! I love our Big-Body-Benz! Maybe we'll bust out a little exercise today?   I wouldn't hold a candle to it.   Any who... Have you guys been to Kohl's lately? I recommend you go 'cuz I bought a skirt in there for $4.80 yesterday and you KNOW that my skirt is the bomb diggitty, right? Well, of course it is! I bought it, duh! It matches those suede sliders I bought not too long ago. I can't wait to rock those together. Any who, go to Kohl's. Oh, and for my Texas folks -- Tax Free weekend is&nbsp;here. For every $100 you really only save about $8 but hey, that's  16  of those 99-cent tacos from Jack 'n the Box or  40  of those 5 piece nuggets from Wendy's? Better yet, it's G A&nbsp;S money. Make Tax Free weekend work for you, people.   May I also say that  urlLink Smashitsusa  is the greatest thing ever invented. I mean, that's the way I feel TODAY --&nbsp;tomorrow I could appreciate call waiting, lids or something? What other place would I be able to listen to an album for free? It beats burning a cd 'cuz yeah, that's  illegal .   I have to confess something. Maroon 5 just came to Houston to tour with John Mayer and I secretly wished I could have gone to that concert. Can I also say that I want to go to the Usher concert, too? Well, that's mainly because Kanye West will be his opening act, so that doesn't truly count.   Any who... It's about time for my midday nap. Holla!   Oh, shoot, before I forget -- Who's down for a little comedy at Improv this weekend? I want to see Gary Coleman! He's this hilarious white dude that wrecks shop on black people jokes. Seriously, he'll tickle your pickle. Call me!    urlLink Remember this song?

      You know, I was really trying to be good about this, but I can't. Have you guys heard the saga surrounding Ricky Williams from the Miami Dolphins? He decided he wanted to retire from football, blahzay blahzay. And as guessed, he renigged, and is now back with the Dolphins. According to this  urlLink article on ESPN  he 'retired' because he didn't want to fail yet another drug test?? Apparently, he's been touring with Lenny Kravitz and ... yadda yadda, he loves Bob Marley... yadda yadda, drinks 32 ounces of "Extra Clean" before every drug test... and maintains that marijuana is -- just a plant?  He makes my eyes cross and my forehead hurt. I told ya'll that boy's braids were too tight. He cut 'em off, but I don't think he's made that COMPLETE transition. Oh my word, don't get me started on this man.  &nbsp;

      Eatzi's delivers?!!!!!!!!!! What! Get out! I was just looking out of my window and just saw an Eatzi's delivery truck circle 'round the cul-de-sac! I kid you not. Those bastards D E&nbsp;L I V E R ! Who's down with me for&nbsp;a little of that? I think we should save it for our Fake Wedding&nbsp;Day o' Fun, actually. For those of you who have no clue of what Fake Wedding Day is, allow me to tell you...  My friends and I have this zany idea of faking a wedding just so we can get free samples of wedding cake. Sounds lame, huh? Nope. It's genius and you know it. Who doesn't like cake? Who doesn't like FREE cake? Who doesn't like Free cake with  real  icing?! See, what I mean now?&nbsp;All of those flavors yet to be tasted! The  real  stuff. None of that Wal-mart/Kroger, sheet mess. I can't stand that crap. Lord help me if someone ever bought that for my birthday out of the kindness of their heart. I'd tell 'em to send it back and find me a real cake. ....I'm sorry, but 'white' is not a flavor of cake -- it is a  color  and it's not flying with this chick. Ohh, and I'm sure some of you are like, ohhh,&nbsp;if someone bought&nbsp;a sheet cake for you you should be thankful - greatful - pleased about it. My answer to that -- nope. Do you people not know me at all?&nbsp;Geez!   Shooot, don't make me buy my own cake!  Anywho,&nbsp;back to my point...&nbsp;Do you know of a great bakery that has slammin' wedding cake?&nbsp; The counting of calories and cholestrol are no obvious&nbsp;concern of ours.   Wow, I can't believe Eatzi's delivers... all the way out here?!  Fancy that...  Wow, I can't believe they make spray on pantyhose.  Wow, I can't believe that CMC would buy it!   Wow, I can't believe thecrappy service we experienced yesterday. Wow, I can't believe Hedish wants an Al Gereau cd. Wow, I can't believe I'll get paid for the first time (in five weeks)&nbsp;on Friday. Wow, I can't believe that Hedish  really   could  get married before CMC.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Wow, I can't believe that I have 1000 daytime minutes and 750 text messages...   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  yeah, that&nbsp;I don't fancy.

Annnnnnnnnd, Hedish 'Not Marie's article has just made the front page of the neighborhood paper. People, I predict, that it will be the FIRST of many ^_^ Props to you, MRS!   Annnnnnd, I fell asleep at work -- before you  juuuuuuuuddddgggee , it was an accident... the blood bank said that might happen.  Oh yeah, might I also add that the dinner I cooked tonight was off the chizz-ains! Yessir!  I'll exit to a little Ying Yang Twins,  urlLink What's Happnin .   Hedish, don't worry about not having copies of the paper for you, family and/or friends 'cuz I just went on a rampage and stole five papers from neighbors we don't like. Don't worry, it's only stealing if you get caught. Besides, your dad said I could.

      Finally, I've found something to do with my time! Can you believe that yesterday I was watching a sport that was not any where NEAR the likes of baseball?? I was watching the Olympic Trials! I can't believe I almost forgot about those things. I was mad at myself for not knowing it was on t.v. I really was! I flipped to it just in time to see the end of track and field and the beginning of all of the swim races.   Freakin' Gary Hall, Jr. -- I give him the fist! He had a bad start and got X-nayed outta the 100m freestyle. Pay attention, geez! I know he'd better not try that crap in the 100m relays in Greece. This chick isn't having it. No way, mister! I'm still waiting for him to explain why he lost to Alexander Popov in the last Olympics! Ooh, the fist! He should've won...  Gosh, it felt great to watch something that wasn't baseball. It felt great to watch an athlete MOVE and not just stand on a base, spit and check his glove for the zillionth time.   I don't even know what to do with myself. I'm just...   happy ^_^   What time does the homerun derby come on tonight? It's past 6 and I'm gonna need for it to be on now. Do you know they're gonna open up the roof halfway during the derby? I don't know why, but I feel like that's cheating?! As if it would provide an advantage or disadvantage to some players??? Yeah, whatever it's just my theory.   I have this feeling that the city's gonna wish they'd have opened it before the derby started. I mean, what are they gonna do if a ball cracks one of those windows up there? Who's to say how far they travel anywayz?   ...I heard some fellers on ESPN talking about how some select high schoolers and college athletes were hitting it out of the ballpark earlier this afternoon ...it could happen.  Ohh, and did ya hear how the players are gonna try to hit the trains tonight with their homers? Um-hmm, BIG stuff.

      Me and my girls had a fabulous weekend! They are some of the zaniest people on the planet, but let me tell ya, I love the personality that's brought to our table o'fun!  Saturday, we went to a sari shop on Harwin and it felt awesome to watch a 5'9" red head loose her mind like a kid in a candy store. She was overwhelmed by all of the colors, textures and detail on all the fabrics. I giv her props for magically settling on two saris to decorate her apartment. If they'd have had a 'buy one, get one free' sale, we probably never would have left the store.   After visiting another shop around the way, we had the free, ever-so-KIND,  special  services of one of Houston's own homeless window wiper professionales.   Sir, I thank you for your more than likely pee-stained, murky, bubbled, supposedly soapy water (and cigarette butt), and your determination to whipe NOT ONLY our windshield, but also our driver's side rearview mirror despite our REPEATED declines of your free services. Sir, you've got to be  some  type of fellow to keep on pursuing whatever it is that you do, in spite of what others may forcefully tell/curse you. Gosh, the pride you much have to keep on keepin' on...   Not long after our stop light fiasco, the tummies started talking and we got to listening. We settled on a little Greek eatery called Niko Niko's and let me tell ya, Hebert, I wish I'd have found my dollar sooner because then you could've gotten meat! Bummer.  We ended the night by refreshing Newman's memory with a little movie called,  urlLink "Girl's Just Want to Have Fun."  Would you please be so abliged by letting me proclaim--  urlLink Dancin' in heaven  I never thought, I'd ever get my feet this far (Orbital Be-Bop)! Slow, slow! Quick, quick, SLOW!  Has the acting in that movie always been that rough? The overachieving, struggling actor thing? Uhmazing! When I was a kid, no one could tell me anything about that movie. Oh, wait. Nope! You still can't. Sarah Jessica Parker, Helen Hunt and Shannon Doherty all in one movie? NO WAY! It's a mecca and you know it.  ***Hedish,  urlLink this is just for you !***   Ladies, we must do this evening o' fun again. Of course, scratch the homeless guy... Next time we're making that damned light!  I'll leave you all with Saturday night's  urlLink theme song .

      I say PEOPLE,  What?!  Don'tcha wanna get down? Get'cha back up off the wall! I heard all the people sayin',  Get down on it, get down on it!   I'm so happy this rain is over so I can feel like myself again. I woke up not only to a text message, but to some jams. My radio wasn't even on -- it was all internal ^_^ Typical Ken action, I know.  I wonder if all of this is due to MY new Limp Bizkit shirt?  Thanks for the goods Kelly and Rachael. Maybe I'll give it back to ya and maybe I won't.    Do you know I woke up to icing on my feet this morning? Yeah, I found some more. It's on my backpack, my shoes and my purse. And there was blue frosting in my nose! This means I've gotta be domestic all day today -- wash my hair again (not excited), wash clothes, dishes and my sheets (still not excited). Heck, it's already noon! I haven't even had my bath today! I'm behind schedule.  I'm sure ur wondering about this icing thing aren't ya? Rachael and Kelly had their joint birthday party last night. Me and my girls missed the fireworks (not our fault!) because we didn't know. By the time we got there everyone was one step towards  leanin'  (aka tipsy, aka drunk for my non-slangers).   I went inside to quinch my thirst and find a snack and the next thing I know Rachael's sliding a piece of watermelon across my face. Excuse me? I retaliated and threw a pepper down her boobies.  Whoops!  She got a lil' ballzy and slid her finger across her birthday cake... um, hmm... ya'll know the story.   By the time our DISASTER was over we were covered, the walls were covered, and I recommended that only the INSURED take steps across the slick kitchen floor. Unbelievable. I looked over at Rachael and said, "Bummer for whoever bought the cake..." She called me a b*tch...  I reckon I had that coming since the cake  DID  in fact have her name on it ^_^  Needless to say, my stuff still isn't clean and she had a great birthday. Anytime bastard!   Ooh, ooh! I'm invited to another wedding. The future Mandy Goodson, yay! Too bad it's on Saturday :( I feel like I won't be able to make it on such short notice.   Do I have a song of the day?  OH yeah I do!  Kool and the Gang's,  urlLink Get Down on It    My leg hurts from my ankle all the way up -- freaky.

      Anybody that knows me knows I'm a dreamer. Why can't I have what's in the movies, in songs, in books, in my dreams? Some people might say that I'm missing out or holding on to something that isn't, but I don't. I figure if I haven't done anything by this point I probably won't, so why try?  I like knowing that when I go to a bar, I say  water  or  Sprite  with confidence. I like knowing that I haven't the foggiest idea what it means to be trashed or f'ed up. And let me tell ya, I really like knowing that if my monthly's late it's not 'cuz of any one person, but the number of days in February!  Let me tell ya what's got my mind to thinking...  I started to read  The Notebook  today ('cuz I saw it in one of the show homes). This book is uh-mazing. Although East of Eden is still my favorite (so far), I'm tellin' ya it's a doozy. I just hit the mid 100s and I don't want to put it down.  People, I sat here and read the book ALOUD! Feel this:    You are the answer to every prayer offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have. I love you, Allie, more than you can ever imagine. I always have, and I always will."   Of course she replies, with "Oh, Noah..." and we all know what happens after that just from watching the likes of the Serengeti on National Geographic.  But my point is!!!!!!!!!!!!, that this book doesn't help me! It hurts me 'cuz I want what I want-- Why can't I?    I can have it my way at Burger King...       I can't be serious for anything, can I?  LOL  ^_^

       HATED IT!   Yup, that's right. After only being in the theater for an hour, I was ready to floss-and-fly and shoot dueces with the big dogs.   I looked over at my friend, she looked over at the chick sitting next to her, and she looked over at her sister and we were ALL ready to go.  Some lady in front of us confused the movie for a chance at REAL LIFE commentary. 'No, no don't go in there!' 'Watch out!' 'He's gonna get you!' 'Aaaaaah!'  Stab!   How about, 'Shut up and move' or 'I think your car's on fire?' -- yeah, that would've been better.  I ran out of fingers to count all of the screaming sex trophies. You have no idea how I refrained from grabbing the little Thicky Ricardo next to me and giving him a good thrashing. This baby actually threw his pacifer and hit the person who was sitting in front of him! What parents allow their children to do that? Oh my word, use birth control or just plain ol' obstain 'cuz CLEARLY you're not parenting, right. I shoulda given 'em THE FIST!  So, back to this movie...  WHAT?! I'm serious. I sat there. I looked. I waited for a 'good' part. I waited for an intermission. I waited for THE END. Hell, I even waited for the soundtrack to bust out with a few tunes just so I could have something else to do to pass the $3.50 I used on the movie, but  clearly  still needed.  I knew I should have convinced the group to see  Dodgeball  or even  White Chicks  for that matter.   Oprah lied. It wasn't good. It wasn't even  aight . It was awful.  The whole time I watched it I kept thinking to myself, "Why's this girl getting all of these close-ups even though she has a mouth full of overbites and a back that can't sense POSTURE...?" and "Why does he keep walking like that? Does he know how stupid he looks?"    WHAT?!   You think that if I wrote a letter of complaint I could get my $3.50 back for Spider Man 2?  Yeahhhhh, I don't think so either.

      Homer had a bright idea! He said that since all I do is listen to the radio at work, I should call in to win fun prizes ^_^ Don't you know that's what I've been doing all day? I figure my best chances wo win would be on Magic 102, but heck, they haven't even played the song I requested yet! But then again, I did change the channel while I was on the phone. You think they played it already?  Some lawnsmen came this afternoon to the building site where I am and I clearly don't see the service that was paid for. They went into this foresty area and weed-eated, but I can't tell the difference between grass and weeds?! I thought when they mowed they're supposed to have a trashbag that sucks up all of the grass? I see the grass sitting pretty on the cul-de-sac! I'm so confused on the matter.  I heard the most fabulous song today. It was a definite oldie, but anybody who knows music would say that it's an all-time goody! Aretha Franklin's  urlLink "Ain't No Way"  was played on the radio (courtesy of Magic 102) and that voice is uh-mazing! I seriously think tears started to form in these big brownies of mine -- just that great people. Yup!  Grad school, grad school, grad school! The GRE scares me. I haven't had a math course in four years. I always misinterpret stories (go figure) when I read 'em. Do you know that I skipped the long passages on the TASP test because I didn't WANT to read them? I think that at the most, I did three of them? Hate's a good strong word for me (and YOU!) to use, but I'm gonna go ahead and stick it right in here. I hate the word passages and I don't know how to figure out the area of a triangle, a rectangle or a square. What's circumference again and what's the point of a radius? I give the gre THE FINGER -- not even the Fist! See, how bad I hate it? I do :/ I don't need math to be a PR specialist?! My job is to write, to edit, to research and/or to do presentations! If ever I have a question about finance or adding I take it to the accounting department!   Gosh, I hope I don't waste $115 on this test. More loans. It's not even guarnateed that I'll get a CAREER with it. But in a few years a BA won't mean anything! Sons o' Pete I give this blog THE FIST!  freakin gre *_*

      Did you know that's my Dad's commentary on everything? EVERYTHING! It drives my Mom insane and cracks me up for days. Never ever say anything off the wall stupid to him 'cuz it's a given that he's gonna respond with it. Gosh, it cracks me up. He uses it out of context. You'd think it'd be annoying right? Nope! It just gets funnier to me.   Believe it or not, but I'm gonna give props to a certain uptown cutie. I think the boy's the only person who I can talk to on the phone and have THE BEST conversations with in a matter of MINUTES. We didn't even talk for seven minutes tonight and he almost wanted to hang up on me because of the Sox/Yankees game. I was being a bonafide hata and was dang proud of it too. I have to get the boy on his fabrications when I can ^_^ Ken knows sports and Ken knows whining, PAUL! Bring it!  Alicia Keys' latest hit  urlLink Diary  and her should've been hit  urlLink So Simple .

      Can't you tell how today's gonna be just wonderful?   I know every song on the radio! I've heard Prince, Alicia Keys, Mike Jack --the black one, and Marvin Gaye. I've even heard my most FAVORITIST song,  Lady  by The Whispers ^_^ Did I tell ya'll how my driving instructor looked like a Whisper? Heck, he looked like both Whispers 'cuz after all the group is made up of two brothers who are twins.  I think I'm  actually  helping my boss lady, Kacey, to sell new townhomes? Customers are learning my name and finding me to be quite helpful, what? Are the planets lined up in my favor today? Spectacular ^_^   I'm so excited about finally meeting Kacey on Thursday! And you know what? I think she's excited too! We're gonna walk through a few things that'll help me crank it up a notch to sell these townhomes.  Is it me, or do you guys read your blogs again for gramatical errors and misspellings? I do it all the time! I even do it to blogs from past months? I love editing. I can do it in my sleep! Hedish, you need to go back to school so I don't lose my touch! Pronto! Why didn't you let me proofread ur 1960 story? Don't be stingy with the goods, woman.  Although you're unable to scrounge up enough to make it out to the Lord of the Rings concert, I have found you this --  urlLink The White Rider  and  urlLink Foundations of Stone .

      Eye just can't stop writing songs about U Eye love U so much Eye just can't wait 2 get my arms around U And feel Ur touch If eye don't c U real soon baby girl Eye might go insane Eye know it's only been 3 hours But Eye love it when U call my name       --Call My Name     ------------------------------------------------------   I guess I'm just used 2 sailors I think they got water on the brain I think they got more water upstairs Than they got sugar on a candy cane      --Nasty Girl     -----------------------------------------------------  Paint a perfect picture Bring to life a vision in one's mind The beautiful ones always smash the picture Always, everytime          --The Beautiful Ones     ----------------------------------------------   MAN, heard what I say when I tell ya'll that the Prince concert was off the chizzains! I hollered with the best of 'em and danced 'til the lost came back on. I enjoyed the entire concert. Hedish and I started a "Purple Rain" chant that semi made it's way around the place. We participated in the ' oooohh-hooo-ooohs ' at the end of the song, while Prince broke it down on the  gui -tah. I know people preach the likes of Jimi Hendrix and B. B. King when it comes to guitars, but when Prince plays it's a different story. The man laid his guitar on the ground and it continued to play as he walked away!!! He worked it so hard that he eventually had to lay a cloth over it to put it to REST! Come on! I'm sure others could do the same thing, but who cares, they're not Prince?!  The Man is 47 and busted out with his own ol' skool version of the Harlem Shake -- Prince-style! What? I envied the groupies with backstage passes who were selected to dance on stage. One chick sang on HIS mic! ....I wonder what he smelled like -- 'cuz you know Prince's odor is just no  odor .... it's  THE  odor, okay?  I love how people from my church had front row tickets. I don't know why, but I do. I like that they got their praise on Sunday, the day after chanting, "I said the ride was soooo sweeeeeeeet! You must be a limousine!" Hmm, I don't know. But something tells me that Prince wasn't just talking about a car?? Um-umm, not at all.  Today was my second day of work as a reporter! I get business cards and I have my own computer. Before the day was over yesterday, I had made Prince the center of attention on my desk top. I'm really trying to be nice with these people, but it isn't gonna be too much longer before I bust out with my Greatest Hits cd. I'm trying to be nice and it's really hard. But then again, I guess it's a good thing 'cuz I won't be tempted to hit the high notes.  I also wrote my first sports article today. I wrote about two different high school football teams in the area. Can I just say the thought of writing other sports stories in the future pleases me? I'm doing whatever it takes to get to March Madness, the NBA Finals, the Stanley Cup, the World Cup, Wimbeldon, and the SuperBowl. ....and Kevin Garnett, but whatever -- that'll all come in due time!  I want to be on Bob Costas' and ESPN's speed dial!!! I'd even like to be a commentator for swimming during the Olympics! Next to track and field, it's the fastest sport EVERRRRR!    Reader's note:   If any of you out there know me, you know that that last comment was meant to be 100% intentionally serious.   ----------------------------------------------------  Hey, look me over Tell me do U like what U see? Hey, I ain't got no money But honey, I'm rich on personality Hey, check it all out Baby, I know what it's all about Before the night is through U will see my point of view Even if I have 2 scream and shout   Oh baby, I'm a --  STAR!  Ya might not know it now Baby, but I'm a, I'm a --  STAR!  I don't want 2 stop till I reach the top!        -- Baby I'm a Star

      It's true! A few hours ago my parents took me car shopping and might I just say that I'm the ONLY person on the planet who could be choosy about a 'free' car?  People, I laughed hysterically to the point of tears when my parents pointed out a 2003 Mazda Protege`. I DID! I couldn't believe it. Like, I was  c r y i n g  for five minutes because I thought that they COULD NOT be serious about this car! What on earth would I do with a freakin' Mazda Protege`? Do you know how small those things are? No, no, you don't move from an Alero, Stratus or Grand Am to a freakin' Protege`! How could they do that to me?! Oh my word!  I'm sorry but, somebody really ought to hit me because I know full well that I can't be choosy about a free car 'cuz I'm in debt up to my elbows and can't pay a $200 carnote or insurance!  My only request about a car EVER was that it be roomy. That's it. And now it seems like I can't even get that anymore! Boy these old people of mine really kill me sometimes, geez!  I laughed because before I sat in that Protege`, I sat in a 2003 Civic and the leg room in it was unbelievable! I didn't have any room. CMC drives a Civic and we're about the same height and she slides her seat back too, so how the heck am I supposed to have any room? What's gonna happen when I eat a lot (say like, everyday)?! I mean, what if I needed to slide my seat back for more stomach room? In a Civic I wouldn't be able to do that! Yeah, that's a stupid scenario but, no, it isn't! You have to think about these things. I mean, it's about as important as choosing the interior or color of your vehicle. Although, I distinctly remember CMC's requests for no white car and no leather seats, but now she's driving a white car with leather seats, so yeah, I may want to reconsider this thing, right?  Maybe I'll have better luck than she did?   ...or maybe not.  But back to my story... I look at this Protege` and it's so low to the ground that it dips in the front. The windows were tinted. It had a sunroof, which I can't believe that my mom would actually view as a plus because everybody knows that I'm no 'outside' girl, so why would I support having a sunroof -- aka more sun on my skin? Am I not a black enoough child already? Will that not make me sweat? Do I not already complain about any form of exercise that causes perspiration?! Would a sunroof  not  cause perspiration?! WHAT?!  When I was a kid, my parents used to yell at me for staying out in the sun for too long. I'm allergic to grass, plants, mosquito bites and anything that just screams wildlife! Why on earth would I praise a sunroof, again? I sooooo see myself complaining that it'd be turning my forehead darker. I don't want a sunroof. How about I'm more concerned about whether or not my car will have enough bass? It's not like I could afford a system anytime soon, so I'm really gonna need for this car to be bumping. You know, kinda like that Oldsmobile Alero that I picked out? You know,   the one in my driveway   that I picked out for MYself?!!!!!!!  The fist!  So what kinda car do I want, you ask? Ya see, it's kinda like choosing a male confidant...  I won't know until an opportunity presents itself. It's easier for me to say what I don't want than for me to say what it is that I  do  want. I really don't know much about either, but I do know that I haven't waited this long to receive some piece of crap!  Hello? Can I get someone to pass collection on that thought? I mean, I'm just sayin'...  Anywho, I'm still not getting a Protege`, Neon, Accent or a Sentra. I   will   make those old people listen to me.
