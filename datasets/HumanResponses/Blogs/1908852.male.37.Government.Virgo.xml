      Fall is finally here. Time to bring out the jackets and start decorating for the Fall Season.  We just got back from our Florida trip last week. We visited Arnie's mother down in Port Charolotte (about 2 hours south of Orlando). It was a fun trip. The kids also had a good time and went to the pool just about every day. I finally got to visit a Gator Park (Gatorama) and see the alligators and crocodiles. On our trip back home, we drove up A1A coastal highway and drove on the beach in Daytona. We stopped and went through the Ripley's Believe-it-or-Not museum in St. Augistine. Since it was getting late, we took a detour to Jekyll Island, Georgia to find a hotel. We liked having a 2 bedroom condo on the Atlatic Ocean, we extended our stay an extra night and toured the Island and beach before going home. I ended up having to call into work to add an extra day to our vacation, and it was well worth it. Who would have guessed Georgia would have such a nice resort Island.

      I thought I would showcase  urlLink SmoothWall.org  today as a top-pick site to check out.   urlLink SmoothWall.org  develops an Open Source Linux based Firewall server. It supports dial-up, to DSL, to Cable-modem for your internet connection. I swear, you are going to love this free server.

      Yesterday Mom and John Pacitti arrived at Richmond International for a week visit. We had dinner at  urlLink Applebees  and hope to take them to  urlLink Joe's Crab Shack  in  urlLink Fredericksburg, VA .  This weekend we're going to hit Fright Fest at  urlLink   and maybe visit some caverns out west near Front Royal.  Finally, I set up the new  urlLink Aiptek  digital camera as a  urlLink Web Cam  in my office. Still have a few bugs with it and need to work out a better update method. Anyhow, I'll try to have it turned one when I'm at the computer.

      Amazing how fast the year goes by. It's November and was starting to feel like it. Leaves are everywhere. I hate having to rake leaves. Maybe it's time to buy the bagger attachment for the tractor/mower.  Holloween was great this year.   Nicky went as Scooby-doo and Ozzy was a giraffe. Billy was over at bill's house this year, so we're still waiting to see what his costume was.  I'm continuing to pack my bags and prepare for my trip East. I love you all, and I'm quite sure I'll return safely.

      Oh yeah, almost forgot. Went to the doctor on 5 Feb, 2004 for the 20 week ultra-sound. It's another boy coming to the Braggfamily.  Arniel is due around the middle of June.  That's gonna make 4 boys.  Wowzers.

      A blast from the past has grabbed mine and my wifes attention once again.  urlLink Ultima Online  is back on the game to play list. This time we're playing on a free shard called  urlLink UO Gamers . It has a bit faster skill gain than the original UO, but since that was the worst part of the old OSI Ultima Online, we don't mind the faster skillz.    Another game I bought recently for my Xmas present was  urlLink Neverwinter Nights . I also bougth the expansions. A co-worker put up a persistant world that several other co-workers join in and we can adventure together. It's a lot more fun than I had imagined. I've been playing so much on my co-workers server, I haven't even had time to play the single-player mode which I hear is just as fun.

       urlLink Braggfamily Picture Gallery  Just finished uploading the latest pictures. Actually updated entire picture gallery. I'm using an auto-generate script that allows me to just upload the pictures and it will automatically create the album pages. Today's set of pictures includes Ozzy's first birthday.

       urlLink Lunarpages - taking your site higher   Here is our new web-hosting site. They offer some tremendous hosting packages. Check em out.  Last weekend Ozzy turned 1 year old. My, he is growing up fast. He's about to start walking. He's been cruising and crawling like a mad-man. He's constantly trying to keep up with his big brothers and wants to be involved in everything going on. Ozzy has 6 teeth, and has had em for about 4 months now. Been working on new ones, chewing on just about anything and everything, but nothing popping through yet.  Nicky and Billy are doing well in home-school. Billy has started reading just about anything he can get his hands on. Nicky is really starting to read well now. He wants to be able to read so he can understand what other kids are typing in games online.  Around the house we have been working on small improvements last year and this year. The dining room got a new paint job last year, and just a couple of weeks ago we bought Pergo to replace the carpeting.  I put the Pergo down, and it really does look nice. We got the premium kind with backing and snap-in feature, but it's still not as-easy-as they make it seem. I'm sure it was a ton easier than real hard-wood tho.  Late last fall we painted the Living room in preparation of some family visits.  Also, Arniel has been working on putting down new tyles in the foyer. I must say, she has done a wonderful job and it's really looking good. Should be done this weekend.

      Just on Sunday Ozzy took 7 consecutive steps after standing from a sitting position. Today he did a little more walking around. His confidence is building daily.  I also wanted to point out that I love my family. Arniel, Billy, Nicky, and Ozzy. Baby Boy is due in June, and we still haven't settled on a name yet. I've got a few good ideas, but I think this one is all Arniel. I still like Einstein.  A few weeks back I got my  urlLink x10.com  camera and techno goodies. So far the wireless video quality leaves a little to be desired, but of course I'm only so far trying to transmit the signal 8 feet below ground into the basement. The lamp modules are fun. I'd like to try out some of the other security and rca connectors (light switches, appliance modules, etc). It's all great fun.  I hope to have a 2nd webcam setup on the outside so I can catch the boys playing outside while I'm at work.

       urlLink Crazy Uses For Coca Cola! . Here's some interesting tidbits about stuff to do with  urlLink Coke  and facts.  I'm going to try something new besides just updating stuff about me and my family occasionally. I'll try to pick a random website. Almost a site of the dapething I guess, but instead of each day, more like "whenever-I-feel-like-it-a-day". I'll still add regular updates about the family.  Today's update is a rather bad update. Our family lost our baby in the 35th week this past week. He was born and passed on May 22, 2004 (Saturday).  We named him Alexander. He was so beautiful. It's been a very long and hard week and wish that nobody ever has to go through this.  We miss you Alexander!!!

      Testing new feed plugin for my  urlLink Miranda IM  to monitor my  urlLink atom  feed. You can check out  urlLink www.atomenabled.org  to find out about feeds.  Ozzy is walking nearly full speed these days.  Billy has taken over the duties of lawn mower/tractor driver and is now cutting our grass. Good job last weekend Billy!  Nicky has recently started writing his own stories. Mostly involving knights and dragons and saving the princess. Maybe some day he'll get published, or even start a  urlLink blog .  Arniel and the new baby are almost done. The due date is supposed to be around June 23rd. I don't think we're going to make it past the end of the week if things keep up like they have been.  I have a new hobby. You may have noticed the web-cam stuff occasionaly being updated, and now there are two. And soon there are to be maybe 4. And so-on-and-so-on, etc. Hehe. Anyhow I've gotten into this  urlLink X10  craze and want to wire up my entire house to make it like ... "Futuristic even".

      Cheers!  I've been blessed with a coveted  urlLink Gmail  account. Hopefully, I'll start getting invites to hand out. Please don't ask for em, I'll be handing out the first rounds to family and friends. I've only explored the  urlLink Gmail  web interface for a few minutes, but finding some of the features to be quite useful. It has fast reponse, keyboard-shortcuts (single key-press) to specific features, filters, spam, search capabilities. I'm sure it has more that I haven't even found yet.

      I just tried this:  urlLink Jenny Turpish Slapped Me: Quizzes - Better Personality .     Wackiness: 66/100 Rationality: 32/100 Constructiveness: 34/100 Leadership: 34/100    You are a WEDF--Wacky Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a menace to society, depending on how you channel your energies. You chew your fingers and have an addictive personality. Properly guided, you can be enormously productive--otherwise you run amok, stir up trouble, and generally have a hell of a good time.  To your friends, you are a source of relentless entertainment. You often get into trouble, but you almost always find a way out. You are strangely popular and feed off others' energy. You live hard, seize the day, and although your more sober friends would like to see you settled down, you generally have fewer regrets and better memories than they do. Your tenet is that, at the end of the day, one regrets only what one didn't try. You are right.  You could benefit from outside help in balancing your highs and lows. Or perhaps cutting back on the caffeine.      No, I'm not cutting back on the caffeine. But this is oddly accurate.
