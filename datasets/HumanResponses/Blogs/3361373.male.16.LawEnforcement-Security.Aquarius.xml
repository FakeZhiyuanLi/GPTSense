						   ...The shine of my potential, Such a strange illumination, A world now opens up to me, Through my imagination...  I’m ready to face the world.  I have heard some news of a big case my uncle wants to take that’s across seas.  I want this.  It will be difficult to track this guy down, but it shouldn’t be too difficult for a professional like me, right?  There is danger in capturing this guy, but the reward is very… tempting.  I’ve got word that this man is an escapee from some prison in India, but that’s all I know for now.  I should get more details later.  This is my fantasy world… I’ll make the best of it.  "Imagination is more important than knowledge."  -Albert Einstein

						   “How do you depend on a person, when people are so unreliable?  In the end, you will have nothing.  The people around you will vanish, and you will be left with an empty feeling.”  This is my greatest fear.  The pain of this feeling is unbearable, that’s why I have kept my distance from many people.  I’m glad I have the courage to deal with this...  I will not be defeated.  "Fear defeats more people than any other one thing in the world."  -Ralph Waldo Emerson

						   OH MY GOD!!!  She looked so amazing today in her skirt and white tank top.  She was drop dead gorgeous.  Oh man she looked great.  When I first saw her I was stunned.  My heart skipped a few beats.  Just standing their smiling, glistening in the light.  I felt like my mouth was wide open from all the amzement.  hehe, here's a poem from the soul...  ...I lie on the ground, and stare into space, the stars start to move, into the shape of your face.  I see you there now, looking down at me, with that cute little smile, that I like to see.  You say "close your eyes" "tell me what you see" I see only two people, just you and me.  We're walking the shoreline, with our feet getting wet, the horizon turns pink, as the sun starts to set.  We make love through the night, on that white sandy shore, then I hold you while thinking, I could want nothing more.  Oh I wish I could be in that one special place, as I lie on the ground, and I stare into space...

						   I can’t get this thought out of my head.  I wouldn’t mind being a Naval Aviator.  It looks like an exciting job.  I should do it.  It would add an excellent chapter to my “story.”  Ohh… hmm I guess I never explained what my “story” is, its my life story.  Long ago my grandfather told me if I was telling my “story” would anyone care, would I care about hearing it?  He taught me to live my life to the fullest.  So… I’m gonna do everything I can do to broaden my horizons.  But, settling down sounds great too.  When I finish I’ll settle with the best of the world.  Haha, I wonder if I looked into the future… would I see a familiar face?  Oh well, that’s life’s little surprises.  What is this that I’m feeling…

						   What can I say…  I took a beating from a girl.  The students in my 4th period class have to tell and show something special to their lives in front of their class.  It’s freakin show and tell… Honestly!  The last time I did this I was in like 2nd grade.  We are in high school.  Who does she think we are?  Anyway, Nicole is a wrestler and she thought that would be cool to show us what its like to wrestle.  It was cool at first, because she was wrestling her fellow wrestler and best friend.  But… then she said she could do a few of her moves better if it were a guy.  So guess who was picked to roll around with this girl… me.  She’s a hell of a fighter.  I feel sorry for the guy who wants to rape this girl late at night.  He’ll definitely be in for a surprise.  …(sigh) that hurt.

						   I’m not much of a sexual guy.  Sex is a complexity of its own really.  Some people search for this oasis like it’s the answer to life’s problems.  I believe it’s a commitment and vow a person should make to someone they have an extreme closeness to.  A gift of pleasure to the significant other.  (Sigh)… poor Nicole.  Nicole is a girl that, I think, wants me.  She recently told me that she would give up her virginity to me in a bathroom during my fourth period class.  Honestly… what do you say to something like that!?  “Thanks.  I’m sure the sex would have been incredible if we were in a different lifetime.”  I can’t, though.  I couldn’t hurt this girl I’m seeing now.  She’s so sweet and innocent.  I just want to hold her tight and let the world take us wherever.  That’s why I don’t care about sex or looking for it.  I’m done.  The only thing I need is to have her by my side and hold her tight.  That’s MY heaven on earth.

						   I live my life freely, but not without structure.  Even though I'm just a boy, I am a man.  Confusing you say?  Not really.  You just have to read my mind.  Oh, so you don't have that ability?  Everyone in the world has the potential to read a book and a mind.  You just have to concentrate on reading and not let your mind wonder.  It's easy, if you sit back and listen.  But anyway, I'm a well rounded guy.  I have many skills that I have worked hard to aquire.  One of those is playing the piano.  I'm also excited about getting into the bounty hunting business.  I try to stay modest.  A great man once told me, that the ability of a man is made possible by the perspective of the others around him.  Soo that is why I'm not cocky.  This is my "code."  It may be wierd to understand, but this is my look on life.

						   I know, I know.  It took you a while to find this thing.  I'm surprised you would actually take your time to find this.  The rules of this thing is that, you have to start from the bottom and go up.  I hope you enjoy what you see.

						   I am the last person that should be doing this type of thing.  But this is me.  My name is Quentin Arnold.  I live in the middle of nowhere.  But it could be worse.  I have recently found a treasure that I will cherish for a long time.  It is, without a doubt, the most beautiful thing I have come across in my lifetime.  My only wish is, for the people that read this, to find something like it.  I like to think I have soul and passion.  You will find out later that having A soul and having soul are two different things.  It's hard to list all of my attributes in one post so you'll have to figure me out along the way.  Although their is one type of person I can't stand, and that is a hypocrite.  These type of people frustrate me soo much!!!  Hearing or seeing a person like this boils my blood.  But I forgive and forget.

						   Honestly, These traits sound familiar don’t they?  Most of the things described in the last entry is mainly true…  Too Weird, But if you know who I am, then you know that I do the things mentioned.  Not that I believe in this sort of thing, but… haha I actually thought I was becoming a poet because of what Cassie has shown me, but that too seems to be a trait of the Aquarian.  Well, I guess this kinda explains why I do the things I do.  This is very odd. Check out the likes and dislikes section, this hits me right on.  And also check out paragraph 5 after the traditional aquarian traits section.  (Cassie, I'm like that with you.)

						   This is really wierd... but these traits do seem familar. Hmm, very strange. I have the sign Aquarius. Here's what it stands for...  Traditional Aquarian Traits  Friendly and humanitarian Honest and loyal Original and inventive Independent and intellectual  On the dark side....  Intractable and contrary Perverse and unpredictable Unemotional and detached  Aquarians basically possess strong and attractive personalities. They fall into two principle types: one shy, sensitive, gentle and patient; the other exuberant, lively and exhibitionist, sometimes hiding the considerable depths of their character under a cloak of frivolity. Both types are strong willed and forceful in their different ways and have strong convictions, though as they seek truth above all things, they are usually honest enough to change their opinions, however firmly held, if evidence comes to light which persuades them that they have been mistaken. They have a breadth of vision that brings diverse factors into a whole, and can see both sides of an argument without shilly-shallying as to which side to take. Consequently they are unprejudiced and tolerant of other points of view. This is because they can see the validity of the argument, even if they do not accept it themselves. They obey the Quaker exhortation to "Be open to truth, from whatever source it comes," and are prepared to learn from everyone.  Both types are humane, frank, serious minded, genial, refined, sometimes ethereal, and idealistic, though this last quality is tempered with a sensible practicality. They are quick, active and persevering without being self-assertive, and express themselves with reason, moderation and sometimes, a dry humor.  They are nearly always intelligent, concise, clear and logical. Many are strongly imaginative and psychically intuitive, so that the Age of Aquarius, which is about to begin, is much anticipated by psychic circles as an age in which mankind will experience a great spiritual awakening. The Aquarian philosophical and spiritual bent may be dangerous in that it can drive the subjects into an ivory-tower existence where they meditate on abstractions that bear little relevance to life. On the other hand it can help the many who have scientific leanings to combine these with the Aquarian yearning for the universal recognition of the brotherhood of man, and to embark on scientific research to fulfill their philanthropic ideals of benefiting mankind. When some cause or work of this nature inspires them, they are capable of such devotion to it that they may drive themselves to the point of exhaustion and even risk injuring their health.  Both types need to retire from the world at times and to become temporary loners. They appreciate opportunities for meditation or, if they are religious, of retreats. Even in company they are fiercely independent, refusing to follow the crowd. They dislike interference by others, however helpfully intended, and will accept it only on their own terms. Normally they have good taste in drama, music and art, and are also gifted in the arts, especially drama.  In spite of the often intensely magnetic, forthcoming and open personality of the more extrovert kind of Aquarian, and of their desire to help humanity, neither type makes friends easily. They sometimes appear to condescend to others and take too little trouble to cultivate the acquaintance of people who do not particularly appeal to them. They do not give themselves easily - perhaps their judgment of human nature is too good for that - and are sometimes accounted cold. But once they decide that someone is worthy of their friendship or love, they can exert an almost hypnotic and irresistible mental attraction on them and will themselves become tenacious friends or lovers, ready to sacrifice everything for their partners and be faithful to them for life. However, they are sometimes disappointed emotionally because their own high personal ideals cause them to demand more of others than is reasonable. And if they are deceived their anger is terrible. If disillusioned, they do not forgive.  Aquarians work best in group projects, provided that they are recognized as having a leading part in them. They have a feeling of unity with nature and a desire for knowledge and truth that makes them admirable scientists, especially astronomers and natural historians. They may excel in photography, radiography, electronics - anything connected with the electrical and radio industries - aviation and everything technical. On the arts and humanities side their progressive tendencies can be expressed in writing, especially poetry, and broadcasting, or as welfare workers and teachers. Some have gifts as entertainers and make good character actors (having an ability to mimic) and musicians. The more psychic among them possess healing gifts, especially in curing the mentally sick.  Among the faults to which they are liable are fanatical eccentricity, wayward egotism, excessive detachment and an inclination to retreat from life and society, and a tendency to be extremely dogmatic in their opinions. Aquarians can be a threat to all they survey or a great boon for humanity in general. Circumstances - for example, continuous opposition to a cause they hold dear - may cause the atrophy of the openness of mind that is one of the Aquarian's most attractive traits. They may express a lack of integrity in broken promises, secretiveness or cunning. Simmering anger and resentment, rudeness or, worse, a tense, threatening silence which may suddenly burst out in eruptions of extreme temper, these are all part of the negative side of the Aquarian. This can also reveal itself in a sustained hatred for enemies that is capable of enlarging itself into a misanthropy toward the whole of mankind.  LIKES  Fighting for Causes  Dreaming and Planning for the Future  Thinking of the Past  Good Companions  Having Fun   DISLIKES  Full of Air Promises  Excessive Loneliness  The Ordinary  Imitations  Idealistic   The symbol associated with your sign is the water bearer, it is symbolic of the Gods nourishing the earth with life giving energies. One of the first to be called the water bearer was the Greek God Zeus in mythology.
