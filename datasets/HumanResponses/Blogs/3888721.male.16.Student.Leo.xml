      Today is a boring day, imagine birthday eve to be a boring day, u would be half dead by the time the next day arrive. Anyway, woke up early today, and it was raining crap and dog. I was awakened by the fans from the toronto stadium, which is showing live on tv, Liverpool VS Porto. The match wasn't very exciting, as porto was doing the 10 man behind the ball, but they proved to be threatening at times too. Liverpool has quite alot possession but possession doesn't mean u would win, and yeah...liverpool lost. They had more chances i think, but Porto were more clinical in their finishing. Anyway, the rest of the day was crap, staying at home, watching tv, went on net, doing homework. Speaking about homework, haven done much, still have alot maths to do, and the worst part is to hav to do relative velocity. In my whole 15 yrs, 364 days, 23hrs and about 40mins, its the most crappy and stupid topic i have come to study since i began my interest in maths. Anyway, most of the time spent on sleeping, don know why, but feel tired. So yup, trying to do my homework now. About 20 mins to my sweet 16, wat wishes do i hav...definitely, WORLD PEACE. haha... and of course, save this god damn world man, stop using resources like there's no tomolo. Just remember the movie The Day After Tommorow, we will be ending up like those ppl if this still carries on. I wonder how many people remember my birthday..haha. Hmm...My family members wished me in advance, my ah ma gave me $50. Although she quite naggy sometimes, but she is very good to me and my sister, and i feel sorry for her when sometimes relatives scold her. Of course, my gd old cruise fren, clara, as usual, with her superb memory, didnt forget too. haha...thanx. Well, think its back to work, we shall see who remembers later...about 13 mins more to go.....

It's quite lame la, ask non catholic go attend, of course is sleep rite, and thus i sleep while they sang. Yup...after that went to justin house...OLE! The atmosphere quite relac today la, everybody play play, slack slack. Then Ivan the monkey climb up a 20m tall tree to get the ball down, Ball Pick Of The Day. After that go justin house bathe, then going tuition that time saw trevin, thia they all, so me and junlong also sat down and eat. Then after finished eating about 525, then my tuition at 530, haha.

      Today woke up then feeling damn bloody drowsy, thought was the effect from the flu and cough medicine i ate yesterday, so went to school as usual. I expected the drowsiness to go away, but unfortunately it didnt, so i was trying very hard to keep myself awake. Then after that P.E, convinced myself i wasn't really sick and went to play basketball. Felt ok during the match, but straight after P.E became worst, couldn't keep my eyes open. Then never finished my physics homework, kena send out of class. Very suay lor, i everytime finish his homework wan, but then too many ppl never bring or never do, so he got pissed and send everybody out. After 1 period went for photo taking, i'm still wondering how they broke the bloody chair while standing on it, and the most amazing thing was nobody fell. After that candid shot, then did my noob hair. Those taller wan cheong to the front to sit, then when everbody settled down, i dive in and landed on their legs. think my whole body kena photographed, cause i lying there. After that chinese lessons, 3 periods. Feeling very uncomfortable then, wanted to sleep but couldn't sleep, anot the teacher kao peh again, so i kept myself awake, dozing off occasionally. After came home, buay ta han liao then fall aslp. woke up already evening, then went to hav dinner. The headaches are still there, and my work alot haven do, also cannot pon school. Damn it man, now i understand why sick is not good, affecting my rate of progress, hope tomolo will get better. Now only hope to finish my work and get to sleep...

Anyway, overslept today and missed the copa final, but just for ur info, brazil won on penalties. Went to school, nothing much happen also, today not much lessons la, only kena kp by the geog teacher again, don know why, but they&nbsp;nag and nag and nag, the stress sucks. Then hav to write some lame form for achievements not recognised by school, and of course i got nothing to write about, even if recognised by school i also cannot guarantee got things to write. I mian qiang write a few small achievements down lor. After school went home, then slack, bought some stationary, did my homework, then came online. Listening to jay new song now, qi li xiang. Absolutely rocks, i just wonder how ppl can be so creative, composing and writing endless songs, and it just keeps getting better. Anyway, today is a day for celebration, we got exactly 100 days left to Os, yes...100. Mug as hard as you can now, cause armagedon is coming...

      Sorry for the inconvenience caused. my house under upgrading, so went to my uncle house to stay, today just brought the laptop over. Ya... yesterday got the band concert, then after school went home, took a bathe, nap, then 3++ meet justin they all. After that we went to cine raiders play gunbound and cs. Then after that we play bowling, i first game on form, personal best 174...haha...they call justin turkey king, i double king. Then after that went to eat then straight away cheong to the singapore conference hall. Quite alot ppl there, then we all cheong to the last row to sit. Apart from the occasional screaming and shouting, it was quite boring the concert, but aiya, its mainly because we don't know how to appreciate music, but the band members did generally a good job. The climax of the concert was at the last part, where everybody were shouting and screaming. Then they played the school song. We all stood up and sang the school song, Everybody like turn back to look at us. That was the best moment of my life, i dont regret choosing and coming into maris stella high, this is wat it is all about, "brotherhood". Then after that the band members shouted our marist chant, then we replied. Keep on shouting and shouting, after that abit seh. Then all cheong to lao pa sha to eat. only 10 plus ppl, reach there that time 3 ppl arrange table for us, then don know which one to join, so paiseh. After that stone here and there, then all decided to return home. Haizz... maybe this is about the last time we can cheong until like that, since Os is approaching. I couldnt help but think about wat is gonna happen after Os, our 4 years of frenship, so many happy moments together. We could get together even after the Os, but got new friends liao, it will never be the same again. Haiz, life is like this, we hav to move on. and when we die, we bring these memories away with us.

      Today woke up and went to school. Then have lessons as normal, the geog test and ss test was quite ok i think, also just anyhow whack. So after school intended to stay in school to study and do work, but then kena influenced again, so went to orchard with justin they all. We went to toa payoh central, then i saw my cousin there, hit me for no reason, siao kia. Anyway, we took 143 to Orchard and Trevin kena zap, cause he also become nerd, then always homing, then everybody pissed. After went to eat lunch at burger king at cine, walked pass yoshinoya then saw yiheng and his stead. After lunch we went to 9th floor, then our sponsor, one question:" wan to bowl anot?" Then he see majority raise hand then straight away cheong book lane, si bei on. Then ya, i quite on form la, play 3 games, get 3 drinks. Then 4th game the top scorers match. play with darren 1v1. start off well, but fumble on the way, then went try to recover don seem to get the first strike to get me going, so lost by alot to darren. After that i cheong back to my uncle house, since my house was upgrading. Then my father, sister and uncle went market to eat.(mother playing mahjong, as usual.) Then return home to find everything is in chaos. Everywhere was covered in thick dust. Things got worst after that, heater switch was spoiled, and therefore, NO HEATER, the water damn bloody cold, like the day after tomolo&nbsp; like that. I wonder how to live in this house, I'm already getting irritated by the dust generated by all those drilling. Anyway, I am going to try studying now, tomolo still got chem test, hope can scrap through it, as my house is now not exactly an ideal place to study.

      Today went to school as usual, nothing much happen. Then came home, did some work and sleep. Its always fixed la. After that did abit of my homework again, then bing rong msg me to watch discovery channel. There's this documentary on Bruce Lee, to me, the greatest martial artist that had ever lived...It talked about his works, philosophy on martial arts. It is kinda sad still thinking about it, he has no more sons to carry on his generation after brandon died. He also has a lot of interesting quotes. Aiya...no mood for blogging today, must go study le...tomolo test..

      Firstly, have to apologise for the wrong information on my previous entry. PM Goh is not having his last rally. By the time he stepped down, the next rally is spoken by the by then PM lee. OK...anyway, today was a typical monday. Woke up in the morning feeling lazy, almost went back to sleep again, but managed to drag myself out of bed. Then went to school and everything happen like it should on a normal monday. Then after recess kena zap by chinese teacher, he seemed to be bloody pissed off, and i would be if i was him. Its not the first time the class was in chaos, ppl screaming and shouting, like girl like that. Ya, then heard news that ming yuan whack a guy from band. My hero sia...haha...then we keep pestering him to tell us more info on how he whack the person. Then after school went confrontation with those ppl, then talk abit crap then go home. Alamak, i still thought got fight, make me so kan cheong, in the end...nothing happened. After that went home, nothing much to do, figured out it was too noisy to study, so took a nap and study at nite. After that went market to eat, then slack here and there. Then tried to study abit of chemistry, and intend to continue on later, then after chemistry do abit of ss. Yep, I'm going to study. thats about it for today.

      Sunday is the worst day of the week, there's practically nothing to do on a bloody hot and humid sunday. Anyway, kena pulled out of bed at 9+ today by my parents. I was so pissed and groggy, then went downstairs to eat breakfast, then like still in a blur state. Then came back home, went on the net and did abit of my homework. Tried to study geography but little progress was made. So went to tuition afterwards, then decided with jason that we gonna act blur and just forget about our chinese tuition. So ya...now i am watching the NKF show. As i hav said before, its the only show that can make me drop a tear. I figured maybe because its touching and everyone's crying, so will bu zhi bu jue cry also. The most wasted part is Fei yu qing not able to come and perform...sian halfway. Anyway...hope this week is gonna be a better week, with so many bad things happening to the class last week. oh ya oh ya...and i want wish my hia di, chee lim,&nbsp; a god damn bloody happy birthday. hahaa...fell aslp talking to me darrel darren, the 3 Ds. Are we that boring? hahaha...I don think can hit 1million this time, no big shot to persuade ppl call. Look at 5566, those 5 monkeys can just come out and sing then raised 200000 calls, so ridiculous man. lee guo huang, my idol just came out and sing the modified verion of ba qian huan gei wo ba. After singing, the no. of calls jump drastically, still jumping lor. They did a good job editing the song.&nbsp; Well, its all for charity man... lets be more generous. another 20 plus days, and it will be the last national day rally of our PM Goh. A much anticipated speech, but i rather its not his last...but well, we hav to move on. weekends are unproductive, i rather there's no saturday or sunday, so i would be more motivated to study. Ok.. hope tomolo will be a better day.

      today was a slack day. woke up at 7, then thought i was late for school. Almost wore my uniform, then realised it was a bloody saturday, so went back to sleep. Then woke up around 10 and breakfast was on the table, i appreciate it, parents woke up early in the morning and went to the market to buy breakfast. They usually pull me up of bed when i was younger, but figured out I'm old enough le, won't wan to accompany them to the market. Then after that finished my maths homework, not much difficulty. Then started to move the house cause my father wanted to buy new furnitures. Up and down the stairs carrying my old study table, quite tiring, but well...good exercise. Then brought my sister to tuition then lunch, before rushing back for CM. Quite off form at the beginning, but then picked up after my players came back from injury. My flu from the morning became worst, so i took some flu medicine then went to sleep, still feeling kinda groggy now. Anyway, went online afterwards...then chat until now. Latest news just now, PM goh is going to step down on August the 12th. Quite expected la his decision, but i don't feel like changing a PM. He did a relatively good job as a PM, although i don't know exactly wat, except for those FTAs with other countries, for a better singapore. He's from a poor family, so ya, more or less know the thoughts of the poorer ppl, but mr lee, from a rich and influential family, so ya...don know wat to expect. Plus recently he went to taiwan and screwed our relationship with China, although China was sort of over suspicious, but he shouldn't do that. Anyway...most of us would hav high expectations on him...since previous PMs had done a good job. ok...enough with politics, haha... not really into it though, cant even name ministers. Think I'm gonna go slack now...since there's not much time for me to slack.

      Today woke up and went school, first lesson was chemistry, which turned out to be disastrous. My group was asked to present our project, me justin darrell. This 3 combination, wat type of project can we come up with. Anyway, we presented unrelated stuff, and die lor...confirm fail. After that chinese and maths then english. After that assembly with some lame english quiz. Assembly ended, and it was time for OLE... Today i think never score any goals, super off form. Then after OLE went for tuition...as usual lor chinese tuition. Then after tuition, still in my sch u, return home. My parents then decided that today it was the day to shift our rooms. That was when i was very very very PISSED. I know they did it for my own good, but listening to a so called accurate 'feng shui master'...haiz...anyway, he told me and my sister that we had to exchange room so it could help in our studies. So, my parents heeded his advice anyway, and started moving all my stuff there and all my sis stuff into my room. This is so freaking pointless. At first, i thought it was a gd idea, but after being ordered to move so many things, i changed my mind. This is so damn ridiculous, and the layout of my "new" room is so bloody ugly. Anyway, O level is all about hard work, i don see it related to any of the bloody feng shui. Can u imagine, placing my bed right in the middle of the room...which bloody idiot would even think of that..? Ya, so i was that damn pissed and of course, my sis too. A room i've slept for around 10 years, and they just decided to change it because a clown says so. I made a damn big mistake, i shouldn't even agree to change the rooms in the first place. Anyway, I'm still very pissed now, i hate it when the room is dirty. quite a bad day today, but going to play CM now...thia and bear waiting fer me...

      Another day at school, quite slack today...first 5 periods all language lesson, so just sit there rot, then chemistry lesson everyone presenting their project on the macromolecule, also sit there rot. Then maths lesson, kena scolding from mr lim, cause most of us never put in hard work. Haiz... i can feel the stress, everyday...its increasing, a little at a time. Maybe Mr lim is right, this is just not good enough. I can see other ppl already starting. The sense of urgency was there, like wat ms foo said, but 4 Benedict...most of us are still taking things one thing at a time, slacking, forgetting that prelims and Os are near. Well, cant bother much about them. Everyone is on their own now. Either we make it, or we break it... The a.maths test was quite ok, but was stress at the beginning after receiving the lecture, but i managed to finish the paper. After that went straight home, and found mother playing mahjong again. Ya, so i kicked up a fuss, which she ignored anyway and did abit of maths before taking a nap, then went market for dinner. i think i hav to cut down on sleeping, anot i wont get anywhere. Progress of my studies are slow, but at least...its getting on its way. I really think its time to get serious...for once, before i really screwed my whole life up. Think i'm going to do a little bit more of maths and get to slp, tomolo is gonna be a busy day.

Then later all those slack lessons lor...then after school actually wan go bowling with justin they all, but then figured out Os coming, studies more important, so i went home. then as usual...eat, slp, study.

      Well, today was such a tiring day. I slept at 2 and when taking the Geography test in the first period of school, i was already dozing off. Earlier on, i was watching the Man Utd VS Chelsea, and as expected Chelsea won basically due to Man Utd injuries to 9 of their players, and of course, their defence failed them once again. After 2nd half, i was switching between channels as i was watching Channel 5, and saw Ronald Susilo, convincingly beat World No.1 Lin Dan without much difficulties, and you bet i was impressed. I watched abit of the portugal match and went to sleep soon after, realising that i have to depend on my luck for the geography test in the morning. Thus, i went into the geography period without any knowledge on tourism, which was supposed to be tested. Anyway, i was able, much to my surprise to crap out 2 and a 1/2 pages of geography and passed it up, and just hoped that my winning streak is still there. Anyway, next to kao peh on the list is Physics lesson, where we had our practicals on Monday. Everything was going on smoothly but i was getting tired by the moment, and thus, was yawning every 5 minutes or so. Then, he said:" you wan to yawn go out and yawn, no manners." I retaliated with "yawn also cannot arh", and he said no. Well, CKP, you can just fuck off for all i care you son of a fatherless whoremonger. What I do is really, non of your fucking business, so stop interfering. I then said to wei xiang:"If i am made MOE, the first thing i would do is sack you bloody asshole and if possible, exile you from Singapore, because you are definitely not fit to stay in Singapore." He then carry on to reprimand Nico for whistling, how asinine can he get? why don't he just go and be a parapazzi since he like to interfere in what people are doing. Why can't he be more like his wife, more effective and command respect from the class. CKP, depending on your wife is not good you know, ruan fan(soft rice) is not nice to eat and i can't imagine you, a man is depending on your wife. I figured out our principal didn't want to sack you on account of your wife, for her contribution to the Os students every year in the biology sector. Ok, i shall not waste my breath on this type of useless civil servants, and the that perfect phrase to describe him is "lan yu chong shu". Put him beside Mr Lim Beng Huat, and you can even smell the difference, let alone see it. Everything went on as usual and i went home after school. Me, Mervyn, Chee lim, Ming Yuan, Jonathan had formed a basketball team for tomorrow's P.E. lesson known as the Cartoon Dream Team. We have already formally issued a challenge to Justin's team and the game in expected to commence tomorrow at 0910. Well, I'm given the role Captain America, and yes, expect to see me use my finishing move tomorrow-FINAL JUSTICE.

      Well, today is one hectic day. I woke up at 0715 by my cousin, ming hong call and went to bathe after that. Then after some quarrel with parents, i went over to his house and we then proceeded to er jie office after breakfast. We picked elsa up on the way and went to millenia tower, don't really know how to spell. The office was of high technology and security was very tight. Everything was neat and clean, and the televisions were all flat screen. Then, we went on to study for the next 5 hours until 2, and went for lunch after that. After walking to suntec city and deciding for a long time, we decided to hav buffet at a restaurant called Kuali. The food wasn't that bad, and since it was buffet, i was gorging myself. As er jie had a dinner appointment at 1830, we had nowhere to go but home, so i went to my cousin house to slack. well, my stomach was already in some disorder, but carry on with cycling and further eating dinner when his father bought food home. I was trying very hard to gorge the food down as i almost couldn't take it. After that went to his neighbour house to watch soccer, and was already feeling the after effects of eating too much. After the Tottenham VS Liverpool game which ended in a draw, i then went home, which is around the time now. Stomach is still quite screwed and hope would get better later, gonna take some rest now, so cya...

      Today is Friday the 13th, so well, things shouldn't be going well, but i was not really affected and so, nothing much and embarassing happened. Well, school was as usual, and got the news on English Aural Examinations that everyone passed. I was thinking:"of course everyone passed." I can't imagine anyone failing. Anyway, maths lessons now are practically doing and marking one after the other maths paper. If we keep on regularly do our homework at this rate, i supposed everyone should get an A1 for the Os, I mean, maths is just about practising. After school went home, finished my chinese homework. I was actually quite pissed doing it, the comprehension was that damn difficult, and the answers could not be found in the passage, so have to inference and think. There was another chinese composition to do, but i figured out there was not enough time so off i went for an afternoon nap. Woke up at around 5 and went for tuition. When i came home and switched on my laptop, i was in for a big shocked. Proceeding to soccernet website to see any transfer speculation, i saw the one headline that i was hoping and praying not to see. It states"Real deal as Owen leaves", my biggest nightmare has come true, may be due to the effects of Friday the 13th. I went to liverpool website for more information and realised he is going for just 8 million euro plus a right sided midfielder Real Madrid RESERVE player Antonio Nunez, i would like to emphasize on the word "RESERVE". I went to the forum for more information, and guessed what, if you have Championship Manager on your computer, you could go in and check his statatics for his estimated ability. It was said that he possess the stats of a Division 3 player. Why are Liverpool always getting the wrong signings, but well, it's a new manager so i hoped Rafa would turned him into a gem like how he did to Biscan. I'm still very sad by the fact Owen is leaving, when you think of Liverpool F.C., the first person on your mind would be Michael Owen, and now, he is packing his bag and leaving Anfield. I got no doubt that he took great pains to come to this decision, but...haiz. I just hope Liverpool can do without him and wish him the best of luck in Real. Keep on scoring, Michael, You'll Never Walk Alone.

      Today's activities and event can be sumed up by one word -disasterrific. I was so damn nervous about the exam, that i went to greet the male teacher good morning madam and the female teacher good morning sir. It was so damn comedic but i maintain my composure and did not laugh out. Everything was going quite well, except for a few screw up. Then came the question about leadership and whats makes a leader and a follower, and is it an inborne thing. Therefore, without any hesitation, i instantly reply with a solid example-Mr Goh Chok Tong, now being promoted to Senior Minister. They were nodding their heads, so i guessed that's a good sign. Anyway, just now went to eat dinner, and went to queue for this famous fried oyster stall. My family has a weird habit of eating style, and when i ordered my food:"auntie, fried oyster dowan oyster", everybody looked at me and started laughing. Luckily, the auntie was good and prevent me from further embarassment by saying replace the oyster with prawn. I just sort of reached home and is watching the handover now. Lee Hsien Loong has officially become our new PM and I'm kinda of sad that Mr Goh has stepped down. He has done alot for our country, and sharing the country wealth with the people, I really respect him. It's the start of a new era, so we just have to see what's going to happen next. Well, just want to say a big thank you to Mr Goh Chok Tong for all that he has done for Singapore and the citizens. That's about it, homework is getting more and more now, so cya...

      Well, prelims are coming, so don't expect me to update everyday. The zhong dian is on tomorrow, GCE O'level English oral examination. 10 years...preparing 10 long years for this exam, so I hope i won't screw up tomorrow. I couldn't sleep last night, keep on thinking what's gonna come out for the exams, so can predict that i will be having lesser sleep tonight. I'm feeling that damn pathetic now, and therefore, I'm going to force the study mood to come about, force it like i never force it before, and with everything i am. Now no time to write a long long blog for you readers to enjoy, so sorry about that. Zhong dian for tomorrow...DON'T SCREW UP!!!

                     Yesterday just came back from genting, damn tired so didn't update. Anyway, The Genting trip wasn't too bad, just that it could be better. Yesterday reached JB ar 9, and guess wat, cross the Woodlands checkpoint at 12. The custom checked at Malaysia were worst. Many people were waiting to get their passport chopped, and one of the custom officials, the one which I'm queuing, was talking and taking his own time, as if there were only a few people queuing up. That guy got me so pissed that i could have smacked him straight in the face if not for the glass window.                The weather in Genting was very cooling, but still relatively not high-tech compared to singapore. The place was clean, and it should be, but when u go out of Genting, you could see litter everywhere in the hills and mountain. The people should be more concerned about our environment, should teach them what's stewardship.                 The place actually is quite boring, and as i was quite hum, didn't play much in the theme park there. The arcade was quite old too. The billard there was quite cheap, but didn't have time to play. The nightlife was cool, got a few pubs there. I went in one of them, and there was 2 girls shaking their butts and singing on the bar top. Deep inside, i can't but think they are sluts, keep on flirting with the old ah pek dancing. The second day i went to sportsbook watch soccer, then was too tired after that and went to sleep.                 Actually got alot to blog, but no mood to blog now, will update again tomorrow.

After lunch went home and took a nap then proceed to Ang Mo Kio for tuition. Then decided to go out and called justin, who happened to be in cineleisure with the KFC gang. I went to join them for raiders, and it was damn funny. For tonight, it was quite even, and Jonathan won the Player Of The Day. His camping place changes frequently and always take opponent by surprise. After that discuss for a while and decided to head home. I came home and was nagged for a while, then pack my bag for the Genting trip tomorrow. So, i won't be in Singapore until Monday. Guys, enjoy the national day and stay safe, wan pia zui wait for me come back then pia together...

      Today, I'm not going to talk about what i did. Today, I'm not going to say how i spent my mother's birthday, but today, will be the day, i pay this special tribute to someone special. This person has always been there for us, teaching us, but everyday pass by without him complaining about how tired he is. Mr Lim Beng Huat is one of the most efficient and hardworking i have even seen in my entire life. Please don't be mistaken that other teachers don't work that hard also, they do, just that Mr Lim really gives his all for his students. I still remember the first time he came into the class and  introduced himself as our form teacher for these 2 years. My first impression of him was strict and serious, and he meant business. However, he is not just a person who is strict and serious all his life. There are also times that he would laugh and joke with us. During lessons, he would prepare mathematics notes compiled from the 3 Maths textbook used in Sinagapore, be it A.maths or E.maths. Every lesson, he gives 200% for the class. Rain or shine, he would always be there to help and assist us. The notes he compiled are easy to understand, and if we understand a small part of the chapter, he would compile additional notes to aid us. Examples from the notes are taken from both TYS and textbook, and therefore, while learning, we are also practising past year questions. He is also very keen on giving us a lot of homework and papers to practice, and this means more work for him. However, some people just do not understand the hard work and effort that he puts in and constantly piss him off(e.g. never do their work). He has this red file that records the people who hand in and never hand in their work. Even though some of them constantly piss him off, like that Hong Kong Bastard, he never gave up on them, and keep on hoping that they would turn over a new leaf and start to get serious in doing their work. I respect a lot of teachers in my life, but no one as much as Mr Lim. Sometimes, when we do something wrong that makes him go real mad, he would just scold us. After scolding us, he continues with his lessons. How many people could go very mad at one time and still have the mood and energy to continue with lessons? Not alot...not alot. Today marked the day where he completed our syllabus, which meant, we would not see anymore of his notes. This also meant that we would not learn any more mathematics stuff under him. Today marked the day where he had finished what he was supposed to do, and it all depends on us now. I just want to say a big thank you for Mr Lim for guiding us these 2 years, and therefore, i have dedicated this entry to him. For now, to repay the hard work he had put in these 2 years for me and the class, we just had to study hard and show him by getting the results he always expected from us, as a mean of repaying him for the effort that he had put in for us.

      Today school didn't do much, but morning assembly that time witnessed somebody experience the strength of Dennis. How dumb could he get? Steal from a canteen vendor, and got caught doing it, man...its his lucky day. Lessons was as usual, nothing much happened. After school actually intended to go study with bing rong, but then the study place quite far, so i decided to stay back and attended E.P. I think that Ms Jazilah is a solid chem pro, her notes are all easy to understand and she explained all the complicated things in an easy manner, no wonder she is a former recipient of the Marist Teacher Of The Year. After school i went to eat mac with Goh wei cong. It was quite funny, an old lady suddenly ask him to look after her bag while she go order her food. Wei Cong was definitely shocked and gave that "fuck off understand" face. The whole situation was damn funny and i laughed throughout our meal. Anyway, return home after that, did a bit of maths before taking a nap. When awoken by mother to eat dinner, i hastily wore a singlet and went out. On the car, i was told we were going to Yohan(Upper Thompson there i think) to buy some kitchen stuff for our house, and i was dressed in shorts and singlet. Luckily, it was quite late by the time i reached there and there were not many people around, but it was quite cool walking around shopping centre in singlet and shorts. After that went to eat chicken rice, and i must say it was one of the best i had eaten so far. The chicken simply melted in my mouth and i don't even remember chewing. The feeling was damn shiok. On the way home, i saw a sort of those 3-storey house, and on their porch, there was a vending machine. What the hell is a vending machine doing in the house man, it definitely caught my eye. I just returned home, so yup, going to study now...

                After clearing my maths relative velocity yesterday, i was in for a shock when i went to school today. They told me that there was another homework for chemistry, the november 2002 paper 2 section A, which i completely missed it. I wonder when I'm going to have a day where i have no homework at all and just concentrate on my studies. Anyway, school was quite interesting today. The long 1 and a 1/2 hour maths period was spent on doing relative velocity problems. Mr Lim, the undisputed maths pro printed some additional notes for us, making A.maths:Chpt 19 the most number of pages of notes he had ever given us. It was P.E. afterwards, and i once again landed in Ming yuan team, and once again, lost game after game(though we managed to win once). After that was Mr Chia lesson again, and as usual, he had to chased that Hau out of the class again. Take note, cause i'm not gonna repeat his name again. His freaking fuck face plus his attitude makes him a complete and perfect bastard, so I'm just simply to call him "HKB"(Hong Kong Bastard).             Anyway, the climax of school today was when in the opposite block, there came a series of shouting, which brought about our attention. Unfortunately, our view was blocked by the trees, and so, couldn't see much. The problem was quite serious as after less than a minute, we could see Dennis and Ms Koh proceeding to that particular classroom. After school, we went to find out and heard from the eye-witness that some guy was being punched. I didn't know marists had guts to punch somebody.               Ok...I have not been studying this few days, occupied with homework and slacking, and i wonder when I'm going to get serious. This is the worst time to slack, plus constant nagging, I think i should put away with those slacking. Hope tomorrow doesn't come so fast, cause i've got alot to catch up.

                This few days, my mind is fully occupied with relative velocity, which meant i think of it even before i sleep. Finally, i can temporarily free myself of these thoughts as i finally finished the 3 relative velocity worksheets. Looking at the time table for tomorrow, i saw 3 maths period from 740 to 910, all of a sudden turned moody. It's not that i hate maths period, since Mr Lim is my most respected teacher, but he said earlier on today that we are gonna continue relative velocity, which i dread very much. It's trying to deter me from being a mathematician, which is one of the jobs that i hope i can go into, since i got no ambition.            Anyway, school was usual today, Mr Lim gave me chocolates as my birthday present, and Ms Foo got back my geography test, and surprisingly, i passed. My morale is quite high after passing the last 2 tests, and hope this passing streak can go on. As usual, her sarcastic tone caused many to hav the "talk some more and i'll kick your ass" face. After that lessons nothing much liao, since today was both sciences practical. As usual, darrell ong was fooling around, and occasionally being "zap" by the teachers.             After school actually wanted to go eat mac with the slacker group, but mother said she bought food for me, so i decided to pangseh them, which i always do. and head straight home. I proceed on to finish my vectors worksheet, but halfway through, i was too tired and took a nap. I completed the worksheet after dinner and was exhausted by then. Now I'm trying to study physics but i figured out there would be not much progress, but nevertheless, I'm still trying hard to forced myself.              Dreading school tomorrow, since there's relative velocity period, but tonight, i would be able to sleep peacefully...

      Haiz...as expected, today turned out to be one heck of a crap day. Let's see, the probability of having a bad day on your birthday is 1/365 multiply by 1/2, which is = 1/730. the probability is so so low, but yet it happen. The day started off when i was awoken to go to the temple. I said i wanted to cancel my tuition, then came the whole load of crap from my mother mouth. As the saying goes, "seven morning eight morning, cry father cry mother". When translated to hokkien, it meant qi za bueh za, kao peh kao bu. Naturally, i was pissed, very pissed for the whole morning and afternoon, and it didn't help when there was the 2 vectors worksheets to finish, and i have yet to finish by now. Then i went for the tuition, i am considering to stop the tuition. Firstly, I already have a wonderful maths teacher Mr Lim. Secondly, I go for the tuition basically just to do maths, so without tuition, i can still make time every sunday to do maths. After that i went to some Hong Kong restaurant to eat dinner. The food used to be of world class standard, the photos of hong kong actors and actresses proved it, but the standard has dropped drastically since then. I was eating crap just now, and they have the cheek to charge $160 for the food 9 person ate. A bloody toufu charge $19, wassup with that...? I had no choice but to link the restaurant with that fucker, and obviously, many of us know who that fucker is. That misbegotten son of a motherless whoremonger, whom especially me and wei xiang, hate to the core. Anyway, my clearly irate auntie went to complain. My father was obviously not happy with her, shrugged and went off. Anyway...enough with all the complaints, besides, today is my big day...how can i let these stuff spoiled my mood. Ok...i would like to take this opportunity to thank my friends for remembering my birthday, in order of sequence:   1.   My mother  She wished me happy birthday before going to sleep.   2.Clara  Her superb memory never fails her, wished me happy birthday in advanced on 11+pm.   3.Katherine Teo  this "brother" of mine remembers my birthday clearly due to some incident, which i shan't elaborate on.   4. Cheng Siong  As u can see on the tagboard, if it can be seen, he remembered it.   5.Wei Xiang  This bio-chemist clearly wasn't obsessed with studying as he wished me a happy birthday through his blog.   6.Sze Jzee  This good friend of mine remembered my birthday and smsed me at 2+am and u bet i was surprised.   7.Cheryl(hao peng you)  It would be weird if my hao peng you forgot, but she didn't, smsed me at 11+am.   8.Chee Lim  He took one whole night to remember who's birthday was it...lol   9.Ming Hong  He remembered it and smsed me,I'm eager to exercise my privilege of being to play pool, and hone skills together.  Thats about it i think, remind me if i missed out anybody. This year no present, only got hongbao. haha...but not alot also. Sorry if there's no tagboard in my blog, i don know wat happened too, trying to fix it. Thats all, still have to go do my vectors worksheet. haizzzzzzzz
