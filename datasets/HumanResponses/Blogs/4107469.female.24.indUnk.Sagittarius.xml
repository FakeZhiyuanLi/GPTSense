      O.K., so my son is almost 4 months old and was in the 95th percentile for weight when he was born (9lb 4oz).  Now he is down to around the 25th percentile do to the fact that the kid will not eat!!  Where did this kid come from?  In my family, we LOVE to eat...as you can tell by looking at us.  I never had this problem from my girls.  They were always happy to eat whenever given the opportunity to do so.  He's gone the past 3 weeks now without gaining ANY weight at all.  The dr's are running some tests on him to try and figure out a cause.  I'm a bit worried because he said that if he hasn't gained weight by next Wednesday, he may have to be admitted to the hospital for further testing.  I just can't figure it out!  I just hope and pray that he starts eating good soon.  I don't want him to have to stay at the hospital!!  Well, that's all I can think about right now, so nothing else to "talk" about.

      I don't know why but every summer I start craving ice cream like it's going out of style.  I want some ice cream every day!  Today we went to Utica, where Ye Olde Mill is located(Velvet's Ice Cream Factory).  It is very nice.  I try to go at least once every summer to get some really good ice cream.  It was good today, however traveling the approximate one hour in the car (each way) with the three kids and my grandparents was a bit stressful.  The radio was going, the girls were fighting over anything and everything and the baby was fussy because he doesn't like to be in his carseat for extended periods of time.  All the while, my grandma is trying to calm the baby by "shhhhh"ing louder than he is crying and I'm yelling across the middle seat of the van to the back seat, where the girls are, trying to get them to SHUTTIE!  And my grandfather is just sitting there with one hand on the dashboard to "brace himself", you know, "just in case" like it will do him ANY good if we WERE to get into an accident, because then he would just get his arm broken by the airbag (but that's a different story all together!)  But the scoop of chocolate ice cream with chunks of peanut butter in a waffle cone made it all worthwhile.  O.k. maybe not completely, but it helped.  That and the fact that I got both my lunch and my dinner (stopped at Bob Evans on the way home) paid for.  By the time I got home this evening at about 8:15, I felt like I was going to scream.  So I went on a nice long walk and de-stressed a bit.  I've been trying to do this every night.  Walk that is.  For at least 20 minutes, usually longer though.  Tonight I walked for over an hour.  It's the only "me" time I get.  So I enjoy this time as not only exercise, but time away from the kids where I don't have to worry about anyone but myself and can think about what I want, without distractions, or just not think about anything at all.  Then I got home and all 3 kiddos were sleeping and I got a nice shower.  Now I am sooo ready to try to head off to nighty night land, but the baby is now waking up.  So I must go feed the little man and then off I'll go.

      I can't believe that summer vacation is just about over! My oldest daughter, who is going into 2nd grade, has to start school in 10 short days. There is still so much I wanted to be able to do with her this summer. Go to the park, the pool, on walks. The weather has been too cold lately to go to the pool...It's friggin August! Why is it only 70 degrees outside? We haven't been to the park once this summer. AAAARRRGGGHH! The laundry is piling up beyond control (it's mostly clean, just not folded and put away) and my hubby is really resenting me right now. He doesn't understand how I can "be home all day" and not keep the house clean. Well, I'd like to see him do it. It's not that I don't like a clean house. In fact, I have a very difficult time relaxing if my house is a mess, though, somehow I am getting by. I can't sleep though. I've had a very difficult time getting to sleep lately. For example, it's past midnight right now and everyone in the house is asleep, except for me. Not for lack of trying though. I lay there, beat, exhausted, sleepy as usual (only having gotten a total of about 8 hours sleep the last 2 nights combined) I just can't fall off into dreamland. What's wrong with me? Stress, I suppose. What have I to be stressed about? Oh, let me count the ways. I don't have the energy or time to list them, however. But there's stuff. Lots of   stuff!   Well, it's off to try once again to go to sleep. I'm sure once I finally get there, the baby will wake up ready for his middle of the night feeding...This is my life.
