      Today I went to my uncle's place and then we went to the Statue or Liberty and took some pictures nad stuff...it was pretty fun although the ferry ride to the island and back didnt really go over to well, i've now found out that I do get motion sickness. When we were waiting in the line to board the ferry to come back home my grandma and my sister had to go to the washroom and so they left the line leaving the rest of us there...well you can guess what happened, the ferry came and they hadnt come back yet so me, my grandpa and a friend left on the ferry, leaving my uncle there waiting. So after waiting for another 45min for the next ferry to arrive we left to go back home. While sitting on a bench waiting for the ferry to arrive I was in the sun...didnt get a nosebleed today but I am definitly getting one tommorow...damn sun.

      wow so many good things have happened in the past couple of days...I got a gmail account thanks to my uncle, made my gmail account my msn account ( something ive been trying to do for almost a year ). been to NY so many times, got access to a dvd burner to backup all my cds, and get to play around on a SUN computer ( one I know nothing about - yet ).  One problem with the SUN though, all I can do is get an "ok" prompt. It says 'ok' and I can type a command in ( none of which I know ). Very frustrating when a computer says ok over and over to you, specially when I cant find any help cause I don't know what I'm looking for...

      My grandmother had won some free 20 min call to India thing, which she wasted today by calling the wrong house...that would make me feel real stupid if that was me...  Oh well she still has a free long-distance plan to anywhere in America and Canada (which I tend to be using quite frequently)

      Today there was a "brown party" at my aunts house, and being a brown party you can expect that the 'arriving on time' concept if lost on the guests. Well two families were coming and one of them had the decency to call and say that they were going to be late, the other said they will be on time. Turns out that the people who said they were going to be late arriverd on tiem and the people who said they were arriving on time were an hour late (a standard amount).

       This summer i played sum ball. Not consistantly, but i played sum ball. I played a lot of really good people who taught me when i played them. Overall i have improved a lot and hope to see how I match up with the likes of Geoff and Nikola this year .

        Well after going to bed at 2AM, I got my 10 hours of beauty sleep and woke up....at 12 (for all you math challenged people out there). During my sleep I dreamt of looking out the window and seeing owls all over the cars outisde...Then when I woke up my grandma compared me to an owl because I sleep all day and am up all night. Very 'owlish'.

      Well today (all one hour of it..) I helped Andrew's brother get a rom and emulator he wanted...It really does pay to know your way around google. Hmm maybe I should charge a fee? No that would just be mean...but still its an interesting idea....

      Wow this would be my first blog sent via email instead of using blogger.com. its a pretty cool tool, I can just send an email to a certain email address and it will automatically post to my blog...well I hope this works, would be kinda sad if it didnt work after all the effort it took for me to type out this message lol

      The stupid comments finaly started working...they didnt show up till today and i posted them like how many days ago?? jeez! But yes they have finaly started showing up today after endless hours of looking over the template code 1 . Evidently theres a time delay, thats longer than usual for this sort of thing, before the comments appear on the page.   1  Not really...
