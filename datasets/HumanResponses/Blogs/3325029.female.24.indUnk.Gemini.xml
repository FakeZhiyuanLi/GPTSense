       i am kind of scaring myself. i was just thinking about moving out of utah and when we will be able to, and our lease and all that stuff.  And i was thinking, yah, if we move out to NYC or wherever in May or something of next year, that would be cool. i dont know if i am ready to move before that.  WHAT?!?! it freaked me out then i was thinking that it will be weird moving this time because before i always had a reason to come back and be here. but now that i am married and my husband is with me wherever we move- and i am not in college and coming home for the summer- and all my friends have moved away, it is kinda weird.  the only thing we have here is our parents really, and who knows if they are going to pick up and move to Hawaii?? (which is fine with me!).  So yah, I am kinda comfortable here- i feel old and weird about it. i definatley know i dont want to stay here, but it also seems weird moving.  i have never had this feeling before in my life- NEVER. i am always up and ready to move on and out and whatever. it is like all the times i have  moved in my life have been for a reason and it was just the right time, so i did not feel anxious or weird about moving.  not that i do now- but it is different.  weird.

      work is killing me today- so boring. i should be thankful that i have a low-stress job and all, but sometimes, the boredem just gets to me.  then i start to feel the guilt of my internet usage. blech! today has been filled with dirty little e-mail forwards and fark.com.  that is my highlight of my work day. laugh at other people's stupidity or misfortune, however you look at it. fun times :)

      i had such a relaxing and good weekend. the weather was beautiful and my husband is amazing.   I hardly thought about work the weekend, it was such a wonderful feeling! Best part of the weekend was definately being surprised by pizza when I woke up from my nap. yay!!! I looove pizza!  I also got to watch the movie Batman for the first time.  Very cool movie- yah i know everyone else in the world has already seen it, but still, it freaking rocks! tim burton is a cinematic god.

      last nite was so beautiful. we went to walk down to the bakery to get some snacks and go home to watch roman holiday with audrey hepburn. as we were walking it started to rain so much!! this is a desert here- it never rains like it did last nite. there were sheets of rain coming down and then it turned into hail. i have never seen anything like it here. we ended up walking home in the rain and picking up a couple of drinks at the 7-11. the streets and sidewalks were flooded and we were soaked by the time we got home. i never realized just how hard it is to walk in flip-flops when it is that wet outside! yay for relaxing beautiful evenings. it is so nice to just take your mind off of all of the things you have to do the next day and just live in the moment. :)
