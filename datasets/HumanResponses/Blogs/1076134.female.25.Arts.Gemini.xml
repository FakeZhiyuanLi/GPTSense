         Here's first official harvest from the veggie garden.  urlLink An All Season Burpless Cucumber.  I got my garden in a little late this year (early June) so I am just now getting some produce. I have harvested my basil twice, and used most of the herbs but this is my first real veggie. To honor it properly, I picked up some organic baby lettuce and button mushrooms from a local farmer's market and made a sweet little salad.    urlLink       In addition to the Burpless Cukes I grew 2 other kinds. A new hybrid called  urlLink Cucumber Diva , and a sweet heirloom,  urlLink Lemon Cucumber .    urlLink      urlLink        I have developed a small amount of  urlLink powdery mildew  on some of my cucumber plants, and more on my squash plants. I'm going to use my afternoon today off to try and  urlLink solve  this  urlLink problem , if it doesn't thunderstorm.

      I decided to make a little card to attach to all my gift knits, to let people know what they are made of and how to take care of them. So here is what I came up with. urlLink       I used a photo of the same yarn I used for the sweater, which I think really makes a nice touch. For future tags I will probably switch out the red yarn ball for the coordinating yarn for that project. I also attached a small bit of the yarn used in the sweater, to repair snags or rips if they happen to occur.    Here are a couple overall photos of the tag on the sweater, before it was wrapped. (Left photo: evening sunlight, right photo: morning sun, what a difference.)   urlLink      urlLink       I also found this very cute packaging at Target to wrap it all up in. By "wrap it all up" I mean simply wrapping the folded sweater in tissue paper and sticking it in the gift bag.  urlLink        I will find out tomorrow if they like it. My friend wanted to wait to open it until he was at home with his wife and they could "open it as a family". How cute :)

      Tonight is my  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch , and I just finished the Phildar Baby Sweater so I need to get another project going. I have been wanting to make the Salt Peanuts cardigan from the spring issue of  urlLink Interweave Knits  for months (a present for my Mom's Birthday in September), and figured it's probably time to get started on that.     I ordered the yarn from  urlLink elann.com  literally months ago.  I got Austermann Biella in a deep green color, that's no longer available.    I swatched for this sweater a while back and I ended up having to go down to size 9 needles opposed to the 10.5 used in the pattern. I'm going to double check tonight before starting it, but I'm a loose knitter I guess.

      Well I seamed up the baby sweater and wove in all the pesky ends. Here's the finished sweater.    urlLink      I did a 3 needle bind off for the shoulders from live stitches I had kept on holders. The shoulder seams are nice and small. I used mattress stitch for woven seams everywhere else, and the seams are rather bulky for such a tiny item. In anyone has a better solution for joining sleeves and seaming for baby garments please share.    I ended up choosing this pattern after my first choice didn't pan out. I was originally going to make this sweet little sweater from  urlLink Debbie Bliss Easy Knits .       I ordered the Yarn from  urlLink elann.com .   Endless Summer Collection Lara, 326 Claret.   urlLink       Instead of starting with the sweater, I started with the matching booties. After I finished them, I wasn't very happy with them. They were very slow going on US 3s and the end result wasn't what I had in mind, so I was then in search of a new pattern. I looked in all my books, and looked around on the web and finally settled on the Phildar pattern. The only problem was the gauge was totally different, and I still wanted to use the yarn I had. So I had to double the yarn, and I did some gauge swatches and finally got gauge for the Phildar pattern. The knitted fabric is a little dense but I think it's perfect for a fall sweater.

      I finished knitting and am currently blocking all the pieces for the Phildar Baby sweater. The sweater is for the new baby of a friend at work. She was born on Tuesday, so I think my timing is pretty good. I hope to have it all seamed and finished this week.         I chose the pattern "Veste et chaussons: Modèles n°24" from Enfant Magazine n° 330. Here's a small photo of their pattern sample. It's the cardigan on the hanger.        The pattern is available free online in French from  urlLink Phildar . Your just need to enter your email before downloading it. This was my first project I made from a pattern I translated. I know a little French, which I vaguely remember from my 4 years of it in high school, but I mostly used the  urlLink Sherlock  translator in OS X and some online resources for the knitting terms. These tools got me close, but I still had to do a bunch of edits on my own to have it all make sense. I am currently compiling a French to English knitting-jargon reference sheet, and will post it to the site once it's complete.

       urlLink     I kept the yarn buying under control on Friday on my trip to the Knitting Garden in Westlake. Despite my small purchase, I still managed to spend a couple hours there, looking and samples and fondling yarn. They have decided to stop carrying some yarns, so I was able to score several skeins at 30%. I bought 9 skeins of Mission Falls 1824 Wool in a mix of colors, mostly in or near the green family. I plan to make 2 coordinating pillows for our sofas in our living room, similar to the ones featured in the  urlLink Comforts of Home .     urlLink      urlLink       I also got 2 balls of classic Elite Beatrice in a muted variegated green, blue, orange mix. I plan to use them to make another pair of the fingerless mitts from  urlLink Weekend Knitting .    urlLink     urlLink        I also bought a single skein of Crystal Palace Cotton Chenille in a creamy white color to make another washcloth from  urlLink Weekend Knitting . The first washcloth I made turned out ok, but I am hoping to get better results by using the exact yarn specified in the pattern.     urlLink   urlLink      All there great projects, all with sale yarn! What could be better?

      Today I decided to check out the local farmer's market they have started holding in downtown Akron. It's still early in the year, so there's not much local produce besides green beans and corn, both of which I love, but they're not enough to fill a farmer's market. There were several vendors with plants and flowers, as well as some selling oils, baked goods and assorted fair. I picked up some locally cultivated honey, that's very light and fruity. Delish!       I also happened upon this cute little cart:   urlLink        It's was the cart of Akron Boba and they were selling Bubble Tea! In Akron! I had read about bubble tea from  urlLink mariko   and  urlLink megan , and I was so excited to try it. I got the mango flavor and it tasted quite good. The consistency was that of a smoothie (from what I could tell it was made of mango, tea and ice) but I have to say the boba (black tapioca pearls) where a little disappointing. Chewy and gummy, with little flavor. I may have had a poorly made bubble tea, but at $3, I'm not in any hurry to get another one.     Then later in the day I went to the annual Akron Arts Expo with my friend Juniper. It's held about a mile from my house, and it was a gorgeous day today. Lots of arts and crafts for sale, but I didn't end up buying anything except a giant glass of lemonade with a lot of ice in it. Juniper and I shared a funnel cake and all was good in the world of fair food.

          As part of my company's summer hours*, I'm taking the afternoon of today to go to my favorite semi-LYS, The Knitting Garden on the Westside of Cleveland. The women who own it and work there are so great. They are the exact opposite of all those mean yarn ladies. They also carry tons of great yarn, and have a wide selection of my favorite,  urlLink Rowan . I am interested in seeing this yarn in person, and hope they have some in stock.            I'm going with my friend Juniper, and hope to keep my purchasing to a minimum. I have several projects worth of yarn in my stash and many more on order. (I will detail these orders as they arrive) I am thinking it will have to be something small, but have not decided yet what it will be.     After yarn shopping I am getting a hair cut and meeting an out of town friend for dinner, at Luigi's, the best Italian restaurant in Akron.    *With the Summer Hours option, I work 9 hrs. M-Th, then I only have to work a half day on Friday. It's a very sweet deal. Sometimes the 9 hours days get long but it's definitely worth it when you have a sunny afternoon off. (a rarity in Ohio!)

      I guess this is it, my first blog. I have wanted to start blogging for a while now, but finally got around to doing it. Since this is my first post I'll give you a quick intro to who I am, and the things that interest me and will populate this blog.    I am a 25 years old graphic designer. I live in  urlLink Akron, Ohio . A moderate sized city, 35 miles south of Cleveland. I was formerly known as the  urlLink "Rubber Capital of the World"  and is the birthplace of  urlLink Alcoholics Anonymous . Exciting history, I know...       I recently purchased my first house, a 2 two story Tudor/Colonial style home built in 1927. It is currently my biggest work in progress. Relandscaping the yard, planting a vegetable and fruit garden, painting, tearing up carpet etc. Luckily I have help from my wonderful fiance  urlLink Bob , he's been doing most of the inside work while I've been tackling the outdoor work. The photo below is from March of this year, I hope to get a better one when everything is in full bloom.    urlLink       In addition to gardening and remodeling our house I love to knit, sew and make other crafts. I have a BFA in photography, but I don't take nearly enough photos. I usually have way to many projects going at once and not enough time for all of my interests.    Currently I have been consumed by my knitting. I have been knitting on and off for almost 20 years. I learned from my mother and grandmother when I was about 5 or 6. I mostly made blankets for my barbies and other small, simple projects. After a hiatus during my teenage years, I picked up my needles and began to knit again. Now I am a totally obsessed knitter. I hope this blog will be helpful in documenting and improving my knitting.    urlLink        Last but not least, I'd like to introduce you to my 9 month old, chocolate lab puppy, Willow. She's such a sweet dog, and if you don't mind the biting and jumping, she's the perfect dog.    urlLink        That's about it. Welcome to my new blog.

       urlLink     I'm working my way of the back of my Salt Peanuts sweater. I finished up the lace ribbing and I'm halfway through the wait deceases. So far I like working with the knitted tubular yarn. It's like a flat ribbon off the ball, but as you knit with it, the tube gives and contracts to change it's shape to me more cylindrical rather than twisting. That probably doesn't make much sense, but hopefully you get the idea. I just realized have about 5 weeks to finish this sweater to be done in time for my Mom's birthday, so I better get into gear on this one!

      My basil plants were starting to get a bit overgrown. Despite regular pinching and pruning, they were starting to get flowers. So I figured it was time to give them a hard pruning and cut them way back, to hopefully promote more young growth. I trimmed all the sweet basil plants in my basil hedge and a window box that I have. Here is the hedge before and after. *Notice how now you can actually see the zinnas I planted behind the basil plants in the after shot.  urlLink      urlLink     The trimming yielded 3 large bunches of basil, perfect for a mega-batch of pesto. I plan on making it and freezing it tonight. In the past I had to make several small batches, in my 2.5 cup mini Cuisinart, but now I have a full fledged  urlLink Cuisinart 11 cup Food Processor  (a gift from my aunt) and it plows through triple batches in seconds. I love it!  urlLink

        I have 2 cool links to share today. Both of these link come from marketing emails but they were too cool not to share. The first is the new IKEA catalog is out! Yay! You can view it online or download a PDF copy at their  urlLink website . I was already planning a tentative trip to the Pittsburgh IKEA for sometime in the next few weeks, not it will be all the sweeter. The second link is  urlLink photo.stamps.com  Where you can make real postage stamps out of your own photos. They are a bit pricey for my blood (20 - 37 cent stamps are $19.99) but for something special, like wedding invites, I might be able to justify the cost. For fun I couldn't help by try some out with my puppy Willow.  Look! Now you can vote for the young Willow stamp, or the old Willow stamp!

      Last night I finally cast on the back of my Salt Peanuts sweater. I made 8 rows of slow progress in the lace rib, because I kept getting distracted. It's a rather simple 8 row repeat (only 2 of which require something other than k2 p2 ribbing), but it required just a tad bit more concentration than I could muster while fully engrossed in a bad movie. I'll be picking it back up at lunch today and hope to make some more progress.

        urlLink    In other knitting related news, I think I am going to join the  urlLink pooling colors scarf knit-along  over at the blue blog. This  urlLink pattern  was really the stand out to me in the fall issue of Interweave Knits. For the most part I am not a fan of variegated yarns but this pattern is different. It is knitted like a regular scarf along the short edge, but based on the repeat of the yarn colors and the width of the scarf, the colors turn into vertical stripes! It's done in a sock yarn which is a finer gauge than I usually work with, but I think it will be a nice change of pace.

      I had a gardening weekend and didn't make much progress on on any knitting. I have been enjoying cucumbers all weekend from my little cucumber patch, harvest a new one almost every day. I re-mulched the paths between my beds and added a bit of mulch on top of the beds to cover the soaker hoses, and help with moisture retention now that the dryer part of summer is here. I thought it would be nice to show some "before and after" shots to compare how my garden looked in mid June (about 2 weeks after planting) and now. Before shots are on the left and afters are on the right.  My tomato (roma), eggplant ("little fingers") and pepper (jalapeno, green wonder) plants have grown a lot. The eggplants have a few that are close to being ready to harvest. The peppers are on their way, but I only have a few on each plant. The tomato plants are covered in little tomatoes but they are all still green are are probably weeks away from ripening.  urlLink      urlLink     My hers are all doing really well this summer. In the past I have always grown my herbs in containers and they have done well, but this year I grew them in little plots and they are really taking off. Especially the mint. In this first little plot I have mint (spearmint, peppermint and chocolate mint), thyme (english and common), sage (common), oregano (italian and greek) and chives (common).  urlLink      urlLink     My basil has really been thriving this summer, I actually have 2 basil plots, and a few containers of it. I'm a huge basil fan, I can't get enough. This is my row of sweet basil that has grown into a little hedge.  urlLink      urlLink     This is my other little herb plot, on the other side of the basil "hedge". In this bed I've grown nasturtiums (variegated), dill (mammoth), parsley (curly leaf), cilantro, and a last minute addition of of some orange mint (a late season nursery deal).  urlLink      urlLink     So not to bore you with to much garden talk, I'll save the rest of the veggies and fruit for another post later this week.
