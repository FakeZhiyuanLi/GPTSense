      The beach was too perfect for words. I really had such a great time. Every minute I spend with Lisa is awesome. I really appreciate her letting me come. I couldn't stop smiling the entire time. What a perfect weekend.  Four weeks left of summer...not nearly enough. Maybe even three. I don't know, I don't count. But I know once school starts, I'll be missing Lisa so much and getting down again. For once, I can honestly say I still do not want to go back to school. Usually durig summer by this time, I actually have a want to sort of go back. Not this year.

      The beach--I should be going in about an hour or so. Lisa and her mom are so nice for letting me go-I'm really looking forward to it. I miss her so much.   Last night, we got a call at about 11:00-it was my brother...drunk. Ugh. I'm so sick of him being stupid about it. It's one thing to do that, it's another to get yourelf caught. So I had to drive my mom to some kids house and we pulled him out of the couch, brought him in the car, and when we got home, he passed out on the couch. He doesn't remember a thing. All I know is that his life is going to really suck now....sort of. My parents are used to this kind of thing. I bet he was embarrased though. I felt bad doing it.  Somethings missing right now-but as a whole, I'm feeling really good. Things are going great...and as far as I know, I couldn't be happier.

      Sorry about the last entry ( urlLink A Fog )...the picture link didn't work. (Yeah the baby one). So  urlLink here it is  now. And it should be in that entry now too.  I'm anxiously waiting to leave this house and get out for once. I'm spending this weekend at the beach...I'm too excited for words...but I've probably talked about that way too much.  Nothing interesting is happening at all. Things are going great with Lisa. There's a few people I haven't been able to talk to much or spend time with, but once I get back I'm going to try to make up for that.   Last night went ok. It was a family event...how great could it possibly be?   Hey people, leave me some notes. I know you did on my O.D. All ya gotta do is click the "O Comments" button!(Underneath the entry) Then click on Post a Comment and just like that-you'll raise my self esteem. This "BlogSpot" or whatever it's called really sucks. I can't stand using it but until my mom gets over herself and lets me use the other, than I guess it'll just have to do.

      There was heavy fog today by our house and in the field across from our neighborhood. I can't imagine why there would be in the dead middle of summer and in this area...but I guess it doesn't matter.  I've been scanning pictures all day for a scrapbook my mom's putting together for my grandmother. Tomorrow, my family and all of our cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. are going to give it to her as a birthday gift. There goes another day. At least I won't be painting--something I somehow avoided today. And if I get the pleasure of spending the weeekend with Lisa, then I'll get out of the whole mess easily.  This new "blogger" web site isn't my particular favorite, but since my computer is mysetriously blocking Open Diary, I guess it'll have to do. Unfortunately, all my other entries are lost. Ah well. So to clear up any confusion on who's who and what I'm talking about, my O.D. name was J@sh.  Upon going through countless numbers of photo albums looking at pictures for scanning, I came across  urlLink this , a picture of me as a baby. Now compare it to any recent photo and you must ask yourself: "What happened?" The nose in particular. Maybe I just see things.  Had my last drive time today. Parallel parking. I didn't think that was too important so I sort of zoned out the entire time. It was early. Too early. Turns out I owed 25 dollars. It seems that I owe money to everything I do somehow. Oh well...
