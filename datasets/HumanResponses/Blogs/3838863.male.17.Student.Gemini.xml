      Hello.  Today's the slackest day of the week. Tomorrow gonna be the messest and busiest~  Rained heavily in the morn. Eric's papa went malaysia. There goes my ride to skool.  Total drenched when i boarded the bus. Met freddie. And realised that the rain stopped when we were in the bus. The both of us felt like idiots.. -.-" Pon chinese, studied with weichong again. But only did 4 maths GP questions. =P  had an enjoyable time with him. like always? lolx  Tml, i have avac duties in the morn.  bB first aid class to conduct in the afternoon. Meet-the-parents session in the afternoon. Prayer and sharing in the evening. Dinner with the birthday guys in the bB. =D weichong still jio me go study with him.. Need to fly from jj to shuqun and to jj and back to shuqun. -.-"  oh ya. copied some stuff from sarah's blog:  10. finally got our PW survey going. got it approved. printed. in the midst of gathering forms. ---> http://www.papayapolls.com/x/4p5jix  please do them~  11. dennis ong and warren teo. i bicker with them everyday in school. just like with isaac at home. spitfire in training. can get tiring arguing with two animals. seals and walruses shouldn exist. just wasting resources and space. shouldn make home at jj. but i think mandai zoo wouldn want them either. oh well. --> i don understand why i should be item number 11 when i should be placed at number 1?!~  12. the seal sent a lovely greeting sunday morning. 'love God and trust him with all your heart' a good reminder to kickstart the sabbath day. seals can be adorable sometimes. but its so rare. --> Ya.. squirtles too. lolx~  Sarah invited me to join our jjc's prayer group. Mr chin encouraged it too. So.. =D  there goes my sleep and free mercs ride to skool..  Gonna do some work.  Adios babes and hunkz.

      HElloz~  Had a great day today. Psyco Tay told us to run 3 rounds and 3 monkey bars only. "Then can go for some games." woot~ first time!! lolx~  Watched a video during GP lecture. Its one of the few i nvr regret attending. =P Women = Dogs in Paskistan. I mean literally. I also learnt that the brutal killings were long b4 Islam was introduced to the country. And it became the scapegoat of the brutal killings. Illterate religious leaders taught from the Quran. What a culture.. Hhhmm..  After that, studied with Weichong till about 9pm. Had some arm-wrestling game with him. It was a draw! =PpPPPpp My left arm is stronger, his weaker. His right arm stronger, mine weaker. But he doesn't really care about who wins. He only cares about .............. lolx~ i've learnt my lesson. Not gonna leak any secret while blogging. =P  Had a great time scaring each other with ghost stories. He keep persuading me to join hockey. Donno how much the coach bribed him. lolx~ Oh ya. he enjoyed 'the eye' very much too. Sobx. missing Jerome..  Gonna do some hmwk. JC life = No life Adios~

      Hello again.  Trained my arms and played a little hockey this morn. Hhhmm. Everything seemed fine till after school..  I called Mr Suren on his handphone. Becoz Weichong had some chemistry stuff to ask him. Cant really hear him properly. I think that kinda of irritated him. Yeah. Said some mean stuff to me. He mentioned that i was rude to him during civics lesson. And he was kinda of pissed. But din want to tell me what i said. -.-" I guess it's when he asked for comments for chemistry lessons. Then I told him we wanted a younger and more handsome teacher. It was meant to be a joke? Just wanna say sorry if I hurted him.  Anyway, i finished up my maths A8. And i went home to sleep. Had some deep thoughts... Perhaps God is just throwing Mr Suren at me to draw me back to Him. Ummz.  Gonna do some hmwk~ Adios.

      Hello bloggy.  Feeling very down today. So worn out. Felt like crying. But found no reason why.  Monday blues~ I wrote a little encouragement note for my classmates today. Hope it made a difference in their lives. Go Jesus~   J ustify me.  E nough of myself.  S ick of barrenness.  U se me.  S in get out.  Sometimes, The alphabets on my results slips. Seem to have a greater importance than me. I wonder. What if my l1r5 was 22. Things will never be the same from that hour.  But I thank God that each time these feelings come, I'll turn my eyes upon Jesus. And i'll see 5 'idiots' Loving me for who i am Not what i've accomplished Not what i've done for them  God the Father God the Son God the Holy Spirit My Earthly father My Earthly mother  Lost of words to express my thanks..

      Hello.  Had a great talk with xiaoying over the phone last night. So great to idle around and chat with her. She complained that my Boys are arrogant, over confident etc. Perhaps we're a little too ego bout our 'perfect' drill? lolx~ Yeaha. She was using her mother's handphone. Hope the radiation din kill her. lolx~  Wonderful time with Weichong again. I think the both of us can head for France to get married-cum-honeymoon this year end. lololx~ He'll knock my head if he sees this.. lolx~ We understood photosynthesis inside out and outside in.

      Hello.  Went to bB this morning. Our drill were improving. =D But i feel that too many is giving orders. People in charge don know what they want too. haix.  After tat, i went for AVac duties. Everything went quite well during the rehearsal until the duet part. Zhi Xun told us not to set up the keyboard first. We thought that we will not need the keyboard during the rehearsal. Then Mdm Ho snapped at us. >=( Said some mean things to us. We were at the lost. CAnt find the extension wire.  Had to run to RC room to get more extension. My SM could not take it and I saw him crying outside the hall. In my haste to get the wires and keyboard up, i left him there. But everything went well after that. The real thingy was great.  My SM had a great time running around and having fun again. =D  Reflecting upon the situation, i guess. Sometimes, i do need to just break down and cry too. Perhaps its my rebellous nature.  The harder you push me, the stronger front i'll put up. lolx~ i'm making myself sound so tough. hHhmm. admire Zhi XUn. =D  Oh ya. My mum is not dead against Christians anymore.  XiaoYi juz called me. Thankew God. So so much. MUacKX~  Adios babes and hunks.

      Deep thoughts  Proverbs 27:5,6,10b,17  Better is open rebuke, than hidden love.  Wounds from a friend can be trusted, But an enemy multiplies kisses.  Better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.  As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.  Proverbs 27:5,6,10b,17  Invitation: Pastor Samuel Wang shared something about his life:  Everytime my phone rings in the middle of the night, My wife will jump up and stare blankly at me. We are often troubled by these calls. Fearing that it may be news of an accident, a deceased relative or someone in times of troubles, we hestitate to pick up the call. In my attempt to comfort her, I will always advice her to ignore the call and go to bed. However, my wife wll jump at the phone call saying, "Perhaps it's something important. Perhaps someone is in need. I'll answer." God is more like my wife. He answers. Even when it is in times of troubles.  Last Sunday, Dr Gary Chong shared about the blessings of friendship. "As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another." In the bB, we often sharpen each other.  For the company's good i said. For the individual's good i believed.  Were my motives right?  What was i trying to achieve? To shape the Boy, or to boast about my 'wisdom'.  I've sinned and fell short of the glory of the Lord. A pharisee I am. Stabbing you 'for your own good'. In the context of lending a hand, I'll make you fall flat on the floor.  Perhaps it's meritocracy. It's the system. To climb up high, i'll have to step on others' heads. Perhaps it's our kiasu culture. To feel better, I must overtake him. No.  Its not the system. Nor the culture.  It's my sinful nature. It's my pride. With a coat and a tie on my back, i thought i have scaled the highest peaks.  Lord, let me be like Nicodemus. Through the darkest hour. Come with a gift to Thee. Give me a humble and pure heart. Keep my ways pure and holy. Give me the right reasons to sharpen my friends.  Keep me blameless. till i see Your Face. Amen.

      Hello.  Had a great day in church today. The sermon was about PApa and MaMa. I can choose my friends. I can choose my spouse. But this relationship is too important. That's why God took away my choice. He gave me what's best for me. =D I'm not called DEnniS ONg by chance. God don make mistakes. Erh. Maybe He does. Sometimes..  (glaring at my brother.)   lolx~   Eh. Went to music after that. Then went to school to study with Weichong. Yeaha. Explored another area of the rooftop with him. Took out some windows. I told him we needed at least 3 pieces of the windows out. He insisted on 2. In the end, guess wad? Fatty us. We took out 4 pieces. Dirtied our pants, hands.. It was great fun. lol~  Oh ya. it poured heavily after that. So we decided to go into the toilet to study. Yeaha. I learnt my Kreb's cycle in the gents. Sounds horrible huh? But it's quite a nice place to study. lol~ And Weichong nearly left his wife in the toilet. (His new racket). lolx~ so absent minded. And he gave her a whole lot of kisses when we took it out from the toilet.. How clean right? lolx~  Anyway, looking forward to tomorrow. To study hard and pia hard. And the day after tomorrow. To be able to dine with Xiaoying.  Adios. =)
