      i wonder y i want to die, to c the look in my lover's eye. to cause them that much lost n pain, just to c how much i've gain'd. i'll look bak n see how much better, she made me.&nbsp;as i fade out of life, n my mind&nbsp;fails, my heart retires, n my soul expand out of morality, i feel her tear, not on my dead skin, but on my compassion that is the only thing still alive. i try to open my eyes,&nbsp;to c the thing i desperately need, n&nbsp;i will try, for the&nbsp;rest of my life... to c the face, thta signifies the everything pure n good, the man that i want to b, the things that r worth livnig for.&nbsp;how foolish of me to wonder something that was in&nbsp;b4 my eyes...yes...&nbsp;&nbsp;in the lifetime that i spent w/ that special person, but is my life so meaningless, to allow these pangs of trama? is the meaning so sacrid it is worth my life? does everyone find that something in their life, so destiny has it b found in ur last moments? so i'm&nbsp;wondering is... what would i say in my final breath?

      i wonder y the acheing of ur emotions is by that thing that pumps blood through out ur body. i wonder y it is the core of ur, but only think that. i wonder where ur soul is, n where it is at time, wonder about, since the soul is asleep when were awake, it must b up a other times. since it does not eat the food we cook, it enjoys tastes that we can't begin to imagine. i wonder what it would like to b a soul. i wonder what it would b like to not have a soul. i wonder what we are w/o a soul. i wonder what we r, if not a soul. how much r the heart&nbsp;n the soul contennct'd? how much is the emotional heart, n the physical heart related? its nothing groud breaking, but just something, i've been wondering.

      what is a dancer w/o rythme, a poet w/o literature, a singer w/o a voice, a musician w/ sound,&nbsp;an artist w/o hands,&nbsp; a devine w/o the moves? what is left of that man? romance, meaning hoplessly dreaming. passion, meaning caring w/o question. a romantic, cares not of other things, but is truly in love, n has enough love in their heart, being able to see that look in your eye, in the dark. being able to hold ur hand, by whispering in ur ear. making u feel, like u can never die, or have died, but still feel. make u feel feelings that don't exist, emotions that u once missed, as a person... who has never been in love. that is the magic of passion. n passion, is the only weapon... a romantic needs.

      i wonder what it was like, to exist before poems... like, i wonder if people heard rhyming, but didn't appericate it. i wonder if they knew that rhyming had a certain appeal to people's minds. i wonder if it was the deep words of a poet's heart that made rhyming favorable, n enjoyable.&nbsp; in the same sense, i wonder if athletes would b as famous as they are if they didn't get paid. i wonder if that would b a desirable proffession. but its kind of a lock, that is a logical, n believeal tale of origin, but think about it. athelets r famous, because they make a lot of money, the more famous they r the more money they make, ppl like them because of their skill. but i wonderif ppl would look at them, as much as they do, w/o the money... i wonder what it was like to b the person that first invented rhyming. i mean, it seem'd obvious, but SOMEONE had had to come up w/ it. n even if someone or something gave them the idea, it is astonishing how THEY thought it, n no one else did. its kind of like, when ppl make obvious inventions, its like "o, well that's easy". n yet they didn't make it before they did, if it was so easy. i know most of this is obvious, but, isn't that what i'm talking about? how the most obvious things r great, but making them more complicated makes the beautiful, but i guess this is mostly only true for poety.mayb, the person that created the first kind of poetry, made something so great, that he/she needed poetry to become more famous than the actual writer. lost in the beauty... the name of the author lingers in the pass, dwindling out of ear range, n just above our knowledge.&nbsp; mayb the person that made it, was inspired by another person, n that person they inspired kind of made the first one, but as to inspire someone else... is as almost as poety was made along w/ us? mayb it is so obvious, that God is the greatest writer in...&nbsp; all. mayb, that's y it is so obvious, because to God, it was nothing knew... i wonder if poetry is words that r made beautiful, n that in heaven that all words sound like poetry. that every word that God speaks, while in heaven is as beauty, as music, but as understandable as scipt, n as versitle as paintings. can b seen in many different ways. wow. wouldn't that b wonder?

      another important thing to me i guess would b, being happy. i learn'd this from a lil ol lady i sat next to in an airplane, she said "g's i want'd applejuice too, but didn't know they had it. o well, this is fine" i guess u have to like what u have or u'll b miserable. i mean, u have to b realistic. my parents tell me, "being an adult is dealing w/ problems w/o complaining". in other words, suck it, suck it up. the real world is absorbing things everyday, without going postal, kudoos to those tired old folk, for keeping their head, i wonder what their secert is...

      i've made the saying, "if u have to change for her to like u, it probably won't work out." though, in some to some ppl, that can b view'd as stubborness, or laziness. though if u had to change urself for them to like, that means they really didn't fall for u, but who u became. but to think about it, is that so bad? what is the denfition of learn? : change. if u havn't chang'd u havn't really learn'd n e thing. i guess it always depends on who u ask, i mean, some change is good to some, while bad to others. u can't please everyone, but... u ur not pleasing urself, then how can u please the ones around u? change? change so that ur change will make u happy? i don't know how that all works. watch "the new guy". u'll c what i mean. but that is just one view point. i guess my saying still fits "life is too complicated to b generalized or summ'd up." idk, this is more of a working thought, than an opinion.

      i guess an important thing is to have an open mind. u'd get so much more out of life that way. but... is being a strong member of the religon ur in mean u have a closed mind? or just a made up one. there r some that believe "if there really was a god, how come he doesn't make everyone believe in him?" i'm not telling u there is one, im saying there is. but does that make me a bad person? i guess, america wouldn't b america it would b today if we had closed minds. but america if one of the most closed mind'd countries out there. i mean we use fahrenheit, English measuring, call "football" soccer, and expect most other countries to know english, which isn't even a language native to this country. i don't know what im getting at. but i know its important to have an open mind.

      if (average) humnas had a different number of fingers, say 12; then would our number system b totaly different? ever since we had hands we have thought a certain way. our number of fingers affect things we don't even think of. things that seem logical would b totaly differnet taking a path of its own, via chaos theory. if we had three ears to clean what WOULD an ear cleaner look like?!. i bet if we had a 12 number system (example: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,#,$) then (our) 24 in a 12 digit system would b 20. it gets crazier try figuring out what 300 would b..............250, i think. now do 35..............if u did it my way, then the answer would have been 2#. confusing, eh? i'll end my ranting w/ that. g's im a dork.

      inspriation means: to inhale. i found that interesting. to inhale, but not oxygen, but the richness of meaning that is floating the world.  its kind of like a hidden picture. the picture is always there, but u have to look at it to figure it out. seeing things in different ways can sometimes b the answer, n not just looking at different things.  but funny thing about inspriation... u exhale when ur born. n "expire" meaning to die, reffers to ur final breath. ur exhaling comforting breath, where pain is no longer a factor. exhale, inhale, exhale. that's birth, life n death.

      i've had a friend say they think love is overrated, n yet, they want to eventually get married and have kids. which makes no since to me, i think its commercialized, at first the idea was to solve the mystery that is love. but now ppl try to enjoy other ppl's love n false love as it were a play, or a game. to one that thinks like this, deep down, they must think love is overrated. love is nice, but loving is nicer. i mean, u don't need a lover to have love. n i think that's what my frined means. they've been hurt or something, but if i force the moral of love unto them, they won't find it for them, because the meaning is told w/o words. ur soul concels ur heart. ur soul matures, but ur heart is always a irresponsible teenager. so do i think love is overrated? seen in the wrong way? yes. not as special as it is said to be? i can't say for sure. meaningless? no.

      i wonder if the heart wonders. i wonder if its curious. i wonder what it would b withough emotion. i wonder what color it is. it amazes me that u see horrible things, most often (more than hearing it). n u cry for them. through ur eyes. i wonder if u saw through ur heart, would ur heart cry?. i wonder if every heart beat is a different emotion, many. millions. infinite. but... ur brain doesn't responde or know what to do with all of them. so it ignores it. telemapenmanty? the feelings that something wrong that doesn't exist, knows for better what u did was right, to b fair, had nothing to do with u. feelings accomplished, left out, but about something unimportant. our brains hold us bak. a romantic is someone, who's brain has a truce with their heart. n the heart takes the lead, of the pair. while as. if we were all crazy romantics, without a cooperative heart, then the world would fall into madness. impulse. instinct. animals have the instinct to hunt, to mirate, to b wild. humans have the instinct to love, and destroy. n i promise. i'll answer ur bloggie things once i get good enough answers. i mean, sir gave a good one about "rain" n i read it three times, im still like "um... ? " speachless. yet missinformed. impressed. yet waiting to b please. O.O yet :S.

      why do they say falling in love? is it because once u start, its hard to stop, because love is like skydiving w/o a parachute, nice while it lastes, but u'll always get hurt? because u can't help but fall? because it hurts less if u have someone there? because u've lost ur balance, n for awhile u thought it was fun? because u thought it could work, but u trip n fall. n have no control. because it is just a part of a walk, n if u TOO careful... u'll never fall. or ever run. running is worth the fall.

      let an unearthly wind, take me. let a breath i can't feel blow me, let a hand i can't see touch me, let a light i can't smell guide me, let a poem i can't understand, carry me. let a life i can't live up to, be with me. let things happen, allow things to happen. but just make sure they happen, when u let them. oppurtunity is only worth something, when u know when to cash it in. this is obvious to everyone, that doesn't need to hear it. this is nice to hear, for those who have used it. let ur distractions, b ur smile, n ur goal, b ur face. have someone look at u, n love u. n like u, as well. let them like. let them see. let me live. let me be. let me in. let me cry. let me live. let me...try. let me see. let me learn. but make me breath, before i...let me rhyme to keep ur attention, but only let me try u, n c if i fit. let me try to live, n we'll work with it.   ? happy sunday! ?

      cold is the absence of heat. dark is the absence of light. happiness is the absenece of complication. sadness is the absenece of purpose. angry is the absence of power.  love is the absence of lonilness.

      i've come to find, that being responsibile n having a good simple life, n an important thing to remember, is to have an open mind. to do the things that you have to do, but to have ur own thoughts n opinions. basically, "you can make me do anyting, but u can't make me like it." because, in reality, the only thing that a man really has is their thoughts n feelings.  i guess this is putting it too simply, but. it help'd me. another thing to remeber is "don't get mad, get better."
