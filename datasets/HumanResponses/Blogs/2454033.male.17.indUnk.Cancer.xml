      yeah its been a while since i updated this thing so i might as well fill everyone in on what been going on.  as of yesterday i am officially on vacation for two weeks!!  ooh, and yeasterday my parents suprised me and my sister with an early christmas present.  so now i have a cell phone!!!! finally!  woo hoo!  im so excited.  although it didnt come with text messaging i can still send/recieve if i pay for it.  later today my mom is going to call the people and get me text messaging on my phone.  yay!  but yeah yesterday in half my classes we did nothing and in the other half we had freakin huge final tests and such.  in second period we won the clothing drive and all so we got a pizza party so we sat there eating pizza watching 'anger management' for the whole period.  it was fun.  so im at least in a better mood than i was last week, although there have been a few majorly frustrating moments in my film class, which i dont have for two weeks. (*winks at amy*)  this year our christmas is going to be so out of wack, cause my aunt, uncle, and cousin are going to be at stanford for my cousins chemotherapy stuff and with all the medical stuff they are paying for, they arent doing much for christmas but the rest of us are doing our own little thing for dinner and gifts and stuff.  and i still dont know what im getting people for christmas and i only have 5 days left...  well, i hope everyone out there has a good chirstmas/new year/kwanza/hannakuh/boxing day/holdiay/winter break!!!

      ya, this weekend sucks.  like no one understands anything i do.  i am so fucking tired and no one can understand that.  friday night i spent the night at my uncle's/aunt's cause my uncle had to take my aunt to the ER cause she wasnt feeling good and her blood pressure was way up there and it was not good.  and cause my cousin is going through this thing with cancer and all, and he has had some problems and someone needs to stay with him.  so i end up staying there till 3 am when they got home and i ended up staying the night and such and got very little sleep.  and then saturday night i slept for 5 hours cause i could not get to sleep and i had to be up at 8 cause i had to go to church earlier cause my family computer is all fucked up and my friend says he can fix it.  then about 5 minutes after i get home from church and i get to do some work in our front yard cause we are trying to put in this funky patio style thing and all.  and i've been doing that for most of the day and im just plain freakin tired.   oh yeah, i went quiz crazy yesterday!  oh and i talked to amy last night for like an hour about equal rights and all that.  i could have gone on forever cause im just really enthusiastic about that kind of stuff, but she wasnt feeling good and she needed to get some rest.  but we went on forever about all kinds of stuff about people judging other people and about stereotypes and stuff like that cause they all just really piss me off.  i would feel so much better and more appreciated as a human being if people didnt hate so much.  it just pisses me off so much how people hate anyone that is "different".  well ya know what?  every person on this planet is unique and can be considered "different".  sorry peoples, i could just go no forever about this and all.  so if you want to become an equal rights activist give me a call  :P    ill prolly grow up and be one of those people out protesting for equal rights and all that fun stuff.

      ooh, heres a great way to start off a new blog:  im fuckin pissed.  see, usually a nice guy its just today has been a real bitch and all so its my turn to vent.  my started actually started off pretty good, in first period english we had donuts and watched pirates of the caribbean, witch was just plain cool.  the rest of the day was just your usual friday at school and such.  so when i get home my sister turns the tv and and goes and uses the computer, so later i change the channel and watch my show, and 20 minutes later she comes into the room bitching about how she was watching her show and that i have to give up the tv for her, even though she is using the computer and all.  yeah, my sister had this thing were she thinks she gets everything in the world.  then we start fighting of course, and she tells how pathetic of a person i am.  WTF?? in anyone is pathetic its her.  she should just listen to what she is saying.  oh yeah, and i forgot to mention i was called up to the office 4th period to talk to my councilor about my grades (which suck) and she was trying to 'help' me.  yeah, if everyone would just shut the fuck up and let me fucking do this on my own, i might actually be able to do something.  especially my parents, they need to learn when to just fuck off.  so i was reminded once again how much of a faliure i am.  and if people would leave me alone, i can take care of it.  and just now my dad was yelling at me to put the food away.. yeah shut the fuck up, i will actually put in away WHEN I AM DONE WITH IT!  just shut up, i actually am capable of making a smart decision, believe it or not.  lets see, what else... of yeah i got yelled at again because i havent waved my magic wand and fixed our computer yet.  yeah, i cant do anything until i have the parts i need so stop bitching about how im not donig anything about it.  so far the only bright side of my day was that i had donuts and watched a movie.  oh yeah, and matt called earlier and we talked for a bit, which was cool.  i had called amy earlier and she really wasnt feeling good so i let her go and rest, so talking to matt was good cause its just one of those times where i just need to talk to someone i dont really care what its about.  oh yeah, and my laptop if fucking up again so that is getting me really frustrated.  so by about now, im just about ready to kill someone.  did i mention the part where certain people are also really frustrating me?  its nothing they really did its just how things are.  i just wish so much that i could change things around.  *sigh* someday things will work out just right...  either way, back to me getting pissed off.  so in conclusion i am just completely pissed so just dont fuck with me today.  im really a good person and all, i just had a bad day.

      an excerpt from:  "Ocean Avenue" Yellowcard   "There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise  Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow"

      i should be in a good mood right now, but for many reasons im not.  well just to fill you all in, after school i spent the day at amy's.  on our way there we stopped by cody's cause his house is right by the school cause and he was coming over too and amy had him drive me over cause amy wasnt really allowed to drive me around.  so yeah once again i sat in the car like an antisocial idiot and said just about nothing.  but yeah we get to amy's and i eat all her M&Ms and matt comes over yeah i doubt anyone else felt this but i could have cut the tension with a knife.  but thats only me.  then courtney arrives......  yeah matt and amy go down to her room and yeah courtney is so... unique.  so anyone want some M&Ms?  :P  then eric arrives at some point and then it got really interesting...   so yeah i walk in on courtney and eric in amy's room alone making out, then courtney tries to get me to make out with eric.  which might i add was somewhat successful.  ;P  well, it didnt last long but yeah we did kiss.  then other people come in and say its time for dinner, which i dont think many people ate anyway.  and in amy's room courtney tries to get everyone to have an orgy which actually kinda worked  =/  yeah nothing too obscene but it did have its times.  i think amy completely sterilaized the room after we all left.  im suprised cody actually stayed during all this.  and courtney was intent on watching everyone do everything.  but yeah later i talk to amy, get hit by reality and spend time in her bathroom, while she straightens my hair.  yeah i know that sounds funny, but it was only my bangs.  but yeah eventually eric and courtney and eric leave and the rest of us sit around watching movies and whatnot until i have to go home.  cody drove me home in yet another antisocial silent moment by me.  i dont get it cause im usually not like that, actually im usually the opposite.  but i guess its the thought that someone i really dont know knows about me being bi.  i guess i was just being all nervous that i'd say something stupid or whatever cause i really dont know cody but he seems pretty cool and i dont want him to freak out or anything.  im suprised he didnt freak out during the whole gay orgy thing, but i also wouldnt be suprised if he thought i was some gay slut or something.  but yeah yesterday i was hit by a few realities even though i did have a good time.  but yeah when i get home i burn the new afi cd onto an actual cd and fall asleep listening to it.    so yeah i had a good time at amy's with everyone.  between yesterday and today laura i really scaring me.  i dont think i've ever really seen her this down before and im scared that she might do something stupid or something.  i dont know...  she just deserves better than this.  but yeah i have a bunch of stuff going on in life that i cant even begin to explain, mainly cause i dont even understand it myself.  but i thank all you people who put up with my whining and whatnot cause its nice to know that someone is listening.  but beyond yesterdays escapades and all i dont think much else has really gone on in my life.  oh well.  oh and by the way, for those who havent quite realized i am bisexual.  so there, im officially coming to all those people who read my blog.  go me!

      hello peoples!!  yeah i guess its time for an update of my life.  well here it is...   ok a while ago there was this one guy i cared for and all in my 3rd period named peter and hes a senior and is on the varsity soccer team and all.  so a while ago i decided that the best thing to do was to leave him a letter telling him my feelings and all cause i had to know cause i couldnt walk away from this year without knowing the truth even if it hurt.  so i end up leaving him a well thouht out letter telling him everyone (not my name though) and i left him my e-mail address for him to e-mail me even if he didnt feel the same thing i would at least like to know what he was thinking and all.  so like the loser i am when i get home i end up sitting in front of my computer waiting for an e-mail that is never going to come.  i left him that letter two weeks ago tomorrow and i still havent gotten any word from him.  the fact that he didnt bother writing me a response doesnt change my feelings for him even though i now know that he is straight and i know that that will never change and that the guy i like could never return those same feelings.  *sigh*  so yeah that night i actually cried to amy on the phone until she had to go.  and if you all think im some kind of sissy for actually crying then fuck you.  but yeah then after that i was so freakin tired you peoples have no idea and the next day (which would have been wednesday) i felt like crap mainly cause of peter but cause of other things too so i stayed home.  i go to school thursday and mr. bullock was being a complete asshole and i had to do some make up test and on the top he wrote "try this in college, see what happens"  oh my fucking god, he has absolutely NO right to put that on my test!  he is in no position as a teacher to make any comment like that on my test!  but yeah i also got an F in his class cause he has a stupid policy about if you do less than 60% of your homework you get an automatic F and i didnt do enough of my homework.  and by the way if it werent for his stupid homework policy i would have had a C- in the class cause i did good on the tests and final.  WTF???  he even wrote on the board not to complain about grades cause he only gave you what you earned.  I EARNED A FUCKING C- NOT A FUCKING F YOU ASSHOLE!  so yeah i was pissed about that although i think someone else had brought that topic up and he called me up and said if i do good 2nd semester and get a B and do my homework he will recommend me for calculus.  this weekend i had a pretty good time.  friday i went snowboarding and i had a GREAT time!!!  plus a group from my church was up there too which was cool and a couple of them invited friends from school so i knew some of them as well so i had a great time although i did take one pretty bad fall and ended up hurting my butt... and i slammed my head on the snow and that gave me a headache for the rest of the day.  but otherwise i had a great day.  then when i got home i slept for an hour, took half an hour to pack stuff and my fam and i left for stanford to visit my cousin.  so i spent most of my weekend their, i didnt get back until around 6:20 last night.  when i got home amy and i went to target and got white shirts to make "happy australia day" shirts but the shirt didnt fit me so i didnt get one but amy did and she wore it today.  oh yeah, and we stopped by barnes and noble so i could see if they had the book i was looking for but i couldnt find it. oh well...  then i go back to school today and i now have a new history teacher, hes ok but hes at least better than my old one.  and i now have economics 3rd (still with peter....) so yeah not too much of a change.  and in the rush to get to school i grabbed my cd player that didnt have a cd in it, left my glasses at home, and forgot my cell phone.  so i pretty much had a blurry, boring, day without music.  so i think that pretty much catches you all up on my life.  oh, and by the way HAPPY AUSTRALIA DAY!!!  oh yeah and yesterday i did buy the new all-american rejects cd which is cool and all.  i really like it.

      great, now aly and laura are going to kick my ass.  boy do i have a way with people.  i figured out that people either are pissed off at me, disappointed in me, pity me, or just want to kick my ass.  sometimes a combination too.  but laura just so you know, you werent a bad influence on me, this would have happened regardless.  but lets recap my wonderful day back at school!!  Before school:  Spill hot chocolate all over my pants, great... 1st:  I get detention because i didnt have a free reading book.  we just got back from vacation, give me a break! 2nd:  Boring as hell.  with a really stupid teacher, and a feeble attempt at "group work" 3rd:  i swear i nearly blew a fuse.  for half the period we talked about gay marriage.  mr coburn didnt bad talk it or anything, he didnt really express any opinion but the class really expressed their opinion... 4th:  because i stayed after and talked to mr. coburn about junior statesmen i was late to 4th period and we watched a really boring movie Lunch:  wasnt really that bad kinda just sat around and hung out.  helped andrea with her spanish homework, nothing big. 5th:  oh wow, my head seriously hurt by the end of the period.  we are learning about pythagorean identities, and i actually understand them but they are all from hell 6th:  watched "Toy Story" in espanol, would be better if it was in english.  oh yeah and i hade to write 3 paragraphs about my break.  hell, i dont want to write about my break even in english After School:  talked to laura...   amy and i went to Wendy's and got really cheap food from the dollar menu and went to LAX practice and jut hung out.  i finally got her  the CDs i burned forever ago.

      oh my freakin cow.  i swear im going to kill someone.  there is this show on tv that happened to have come on about the "intersexed" or more simply hermaphrodites.  its stories about people that are born with both male and female attributes and some of the things they have gone through in their life.  my mom is sitting here watching it also.  the tv said something about how they (the people on tv) can feel "alone in an empty room" and my mom goes all "of course they do, having to put on a facade all the time.  it must be horrible"   OH MY FUCKING GOD!  you fucking feel sorry for people born like that but dont give a fuck for those who are gay or bisexual?  just because it is a physical thing means that it is ok?  just because someone's emotions are just the same way you dont fucking care?  why dont you understand that being gay/bi is just the same way?  why dont you understand that i am no different?   sure, i have all the right body parts, but just because my feelings are different than the rest of the world's i am some kind of sub-human?  why dont you ever understand...?

      mleh.  yesterday i went snowboarding!  yeah, it was great.  the other night i finally fell asleep around 12 - 12:30 and woke up at 4 in the morning for no apparent reason.  then i get to get up 2hrs later and go snowboarding.  for being really tired i did pretty well.  but last night i eventually got to sleep at 1 in the morning.  so that was 21 hours straight of being awake.  and i still had problems falling asleep.  but once i finally feel asleep i actually slept pretty well.  or at least a bit better than earlier this week.  i guess it just means im getting used to things the way they are.  i feel bad for not going into more detail but i know that now is not the time.  i just feel bad for leading everyone on about whatever is going on then not telling them.  but yeah another late night texting conversation with both cody and amy last night.  i feel bad taking them away from their lives everytime i have a problem to deal with.  yesterday i thought i was going to have a good day, going snowboarding and all, but last night things just fell apart again.

      this is actually a post i typed up and meant to post on the 18th but when i got on the internet i completely forgot about it.  but hey, better late than never.  yay, another blog entry being typed up in my room;  far far away from the internet.  well today was all too exciting, but good nonetheless.  i finally was able to talk to amy today.  *yay*  well we werent able to talk for too long, mainly cause the three of us (cody was there too) were goofing off a bunch.  but i did talk to her about "stuff" and it felt better to get things off my chest again.  i'm hoping to get together sometime later to go a little more in depth about things.  at about 5:15 andrea came over so the two of them could get ready cause they are both going to the linkin park concert tonight (without me!) and i had to get going.  but i was still able to talk to her and i felt better letting her know this and we can talk more about this later, too.  but other than going over to amy's for a bit, i havent really done too much.  earlier i was actually cleaning my room a bit.  but other than that my day hasnt really been all too exciting.

      yes i did go jogging in the pouring rain the other day.  i wasnt all that bad plus i just had to get out of the house and burn off some extra energy.  and no, i wasnt able to talk to amy the other day.  and i wasnt able to talk to amy yesterday either.  but cody did stop by and we talked for a bit in his car just about "stuff" and it felt good to get it out.  also we just ended up talking about just normal day to day crap and it was all cool.  but eventually i had to go cause it was getting late.  but  had  good time just talking and getting things out.  other than that my life hasn't really been all that exciting.

      ok, well a LOT has happened.   well maybe not a huge amount but  bunch of stuff has happened and it was all very significant slash important.  well last night i slept like absolute crap.  i stayed up hoping to get a phone call or text from either cody or amy cause i was worried.  but im actually getting ahead of myself.  first of all im not going to say too much cause its not my place to really say anything about it, but cody and amy did have some stuff they needed to talk about and whatnot.  well my day started off with me calling amy because i had an "appointment" with her yesterday to talk about stuff.  so i went over to her house and we had carl's jr. and started watching "swim fan" which is a pretty cool movie and kinda freaky at some points.  but eventually amy and i really start talking about stuff that is going on in life and all the stupid things that happen in life.  although i really dont get around to talking about the "big" stuff i was really hoping to talk about.  well the night before (or day or something) cody had texted amy saying that they should talk.  and because i also wanted to talk to cody amy said he could come over while i was still there if it was cool with him.  well he did come over and after a lot of stalling i eventually told him about my feelings for him and that i felt that he had a right to know and that in order for us to have a continuing friendship at all this had to be out in the open.  i lost a good friend once before because of some very stupid decisions i made and i dont want that to happen again.  but when i told cody he took it very well actually and said that it took a lot of courage to come out and say that, which meant a lot to me.  i felt so much better after getting that off my chest.  but the two of us talked for  bit just about everyday stuff and i felt that it was easier for me to talk with him and to just hang out now that i had this out in the open.  well cody and amy finally got around to talking, alone by the way.  but eventually cody ended up driving me home cause the two of them still had some talking to do.  i let both of them know if they needed anything at all to call.  i just hated seeing both of them like that.  well i talked to amy earlier and she said that things worked out pretty well and i also talked to cody and he said things worked out okay but wish they were better.  which i can understand given his position.  i want to talk to amy later about this too.  and yeah i know that i am not part of any of this but i guess i do keep interjecting myself into their affairs.  i guess its part of just being a friend and trying to be there, but also i guess its part just trying to be a part of things and not being left out.  im one of those people that tries to help everyone.  last night after i went home i jsut felt so useless, unable to do anything.  i just wish i could make it better for the both of them, but i also know that they have to work things out on their own.  i guess i just have to trust them to make the right decisions.  hopefully amy can stop by later today cause i really want to talk to her about stuff.  not just about last night but about a few other things that have been on my mind that i really dont want to put of much longer.  its nothing too horrible but it is something that i do need to talk about.  later today im probably going to go jogging and burn off some extra energy and to jsut get out of the house.  plus its a good day to go jogging and all with the rain.  i know it sounds kinda odd but it just is.

      *yawn*  im freakin tired.  i got home from school today and slept for three hours until i was finally woken up and told that we were going out to dinner.  but yeah its been a while since my last post and i figured that i should keep everyone updated and whatnot.  well a lot has happened...  amy and i did have our BIG bathroom moment a while ago and yeah it felt good to get a lot of stuff off my chest and out in the open and it felt good to have a friend their to listen and comfort me.  we did talk about a lot of stuff, some of which i really dont want to repeat.  although it felt good to have that talk i felt that it opened up a lot more stuff to be talked about and i have another "appointment" with her this sunday cause there is a bunch of other stuff for us to talk about again.  i know a lot of stuff i have posted in my blog seem kinda depressing and sad that is mainly cause there is a lot of depressing stuff going on in my life at the moment but dont worry, its not all horrible.  like today we went out to dinner to fresh choice and it was all good.  i like that place, i can eat a bunch and feel pretty good about it cause its all that bad for me.  but yeah there are good things going on, i just really dont post a lot about them cause usually the bad stuff kinda overshadows it, plus when i really need to write and get stuff out of my system i write it in here.  but yeah a lot of stupid stuff is going on.  people are really pissing with tthe way they act and the comments they make.  not to mention my third period is bothersome because now we are actually do stuff in the class now that its econ and not film.  which mean that there is more student interation and it just bothers me with peter and all.  i will admit that i still feel something for him, although its not what it used to be.  i guess its just the process of getting over him.  and then there is this thing about another person who i cant really talk about at the moment.  dont worry, i will eventually.  not to mention this one guy who is some office TA thing and picks up the role sheet for my third period class *dies*  but wow, talk about cute.  oh yeah and im disgruntled because the little banner thing in my last post was the banner for the starting game of the season and the time and teams and it was cool and all, but apparently the people replaced it with a stupid one.  i need to find another good one and replace this one.  except this time ill keep it on my own server, so they dont randomly change things one me.  but yeah our family computer finally got fixed which means more people calling my 8 million times a day asking for help.  -_-  back to the fun stuff.  but yay!  tomorrow is friday meaning the weekend is almost here and my "appointment" with amy and a nifty week long vacation!  but also of course i have a test in chemistry and pre-cal.  but hey either way i get a week off, from school at least.  im sure there will be some other stupid thing to consume my vacation as usual.

      *sigh*  i dont know what to do.  things are just so confusing.  i know what is going on and what it all means.  and i also know where it leads...  i just dont understand what i am supposed to do about it.  i cant be nothing and let this all pass me by but also i dont know to do.  amy and i kinda walked around school at lunch and talked.  it was good to be able to talk but i couldnt really talk about all too much, cause for one there are just some things that i am not going to be talking about at school not to mention that i know i could not say all i wanted during lunch and i probably wouldnt even be able to keep my composure.  but yeah we are getting together after her hair appointment so we can have our BIG time "bathroom moment".  we have a lot to talk about.  theres just too much going on and i dont understand how to deal with it.  i dont like writing about this and not telling all you guys the details but like i said the time will come.  but i've writtne more in my blog in the last week than i have since i got the thing.  i guess its just that now i really have a lot to write about.

      i know i post a bunch of lyrics in here but they are all really good and usually they have a lot to do with what im feeling at the time so i figured i might as well share them with you all.   "Saints and Sailors" Dashboard Confessional   This is where I say I've had enough And no one should ever feel the way that I feel now. A walking open wound, a trophy display of bruises And I don't believe that I'm getting any better. Any better.  Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence.  Wandering this house like I've never wanted out And this is about as social as I get now. And I'm throwing away the letters that I am writing you Cause they would never do, I would never do. Never  Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence.  But don't be a liar Don't say that "everything's working" when everything's broken. And you smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor And your eyes say the jokes on me.  But, I’m not laughing You’re not leaving Who do I think I am kidding? When I’m the only one locked in this hell  Waiting here with hopes the phone will ring And I'm thinking awful things I'm pretty sure that few would notice. And this apartment is starving for an argument. Anything at all to break the silence.  So don't be a liar Don't say that "everything's working" when everything's broken. And you smile like a saint but you curse like a sailor And your eyes say the jokes on me.

      hey.  this is to be a hopelessly long day.  i got to sleep in which was good but school sucked even more due to current issues going on and the fact that we had a test in pre-cal today.  in first today we had to write an essay on The Crucible, third we just sat as mr. coburn lectured andin fifth of course i had a test.  but like i said i wasnt even in the mood to face the world let alone go to school.  amy is supposed to call after she was done doing whatever with andrea but yeah its 6:30 and she wont pick up her cell and her home line is busy (prolly her dad on the internet).  but i really want to talk cause i have so much more to talk about since yesterday and the wait is killing me.  at about 4:30 or something i felt like i really needed to get out of the house (which i *really* did) so i went running/jogging and OMG i realized at one point that i havent gone jogging in forever so of course it nearly drained me.  but yeah somewhere along my path i stopped by taco bell where i used to work, and my evil satanic manager that i hate no longer works their which is cool but i also found out that my really cool manager was kicked down to assistant manager and they have a new restaurant manager who is *nearly* satanic.  but yeah i had to just out of the house and just away from people for a while and get some frustration out so i feel a bit better now.  i feel really stupid writing all this stuff about "issues" or "stuff" and not actually saying what it is.  the thing is i dont know who all is going to read this and there are a couple people that i really dont need knowing the details quite yet.  dont worry they will all come in time.  but also like i said the other night i write this really for myself.  the fact that i post it online for the world to see merely means that i am comfortable with others reading about my life and what goes on in it.  at the moment i just really need to let this out.  its one of those things where you just want to scream load and dont care who hears you or what happens, you just feel like screaming.  but i cant cause people will hear me and people will ask questions; questions that i dont need to be asked.  but i cant change fact.  just as real as the sky being blue i cant change the way other people are or how they feel.  i guess the only thing i can really do is try to understand it and move on.  This fire burns in my heart The anger grows within me I walk closer and closer Knowing that I can end it now They fall to the ground Blood running down their face They all look at me in awe I realize what I have done I run and hope to hide from the world I am consumed my this hate This jealously burns like a fire

      i have no idea what to say.  im lost, confused.  i feel so alone and seperated.  i just feel so detatched from the world.  i didnt really get a chance to talk to amy today cause for one its hard to find a time to talk cause any chance i have its hard for me to talk about whats really on my heart and its really hard to find a private place and time to talk during school.  but i want to talk to her so much, not just on the phone but face to face.  its hard for me to talk about things like these, especially my blog post a coupe days ago when i mentioned the 'S word' and i really need to talk about that.  i cant believe im sitting here and im so jealous of my best friend.  and i so dont want to ruin anything between us.  if i ever lost their friendship i really dont know if i could go on.  they have always been there for me through good and bad and i know i cant go through this on my own.  i guess its just really hard for me to talk to someone about them.  but hey, tomorrow i have an "appointment" with them after school so hopefully i can get eveything off my chest.

      so yeah once again im typing this entry up in my room far, far away from an internet connection meaning ill have to post it tomorrow at some point.  thats the joys of a laptop is that you can just pick it up and move.  i found a new sitting place in my room, i used to sit and lean against my bed;  now im sitting under my window.  and yeah i know how trivial and stupid that must sound but im very picky about my sitting places, especially in my room they have to be very conducive to what im trying to do.  well back to the point.  i guess i sound a little better than i did in my entry the other night and i guess i am kinda, but i still feel the same way and the fact that there is so much stupid stuff going on hasnt changed.  laura read my blog and talked to me about it and all and im glad that she is there for me.  then when amy got on, she read it and she told me that she nearly cried and that i deserved better.  which in turn nearly made me cry.  i swear i've cried more in the past few weeks than i have in five years, seriously.  but yeah she didnt have long to stay on cause it was getting late and she had to go to bed.  which it is getting late (11:45pm) and i guess i should be getting some sleep too although i m such a night person and kinda like right now i do my best work at night.   but thankfully i can sleep in some in the morning cause i dont have to be to school until 11:20 thanks to the exit exams.  but yeah amy and i talked on the phone for a while (before she read my blog just so ya know) and we talked about "stuff" that was bothering me and all that fun stuff.  and yeah i've decided to tell the person what i want to (im sorry i really cant go into details) i really feel the pressure on my heart to let this known.  but yeah who knows maybe afterwards they will read this and know i was talking about them.  but yeah after i tell them i hope that they can understand where i am coming from.  i know it is a very unique experience, to say the least, and i dont really know how they are going to react but i guess i can only hope for the best.  amy said that i was taking a big step and that she is proud of me.  i guess i really am taking a big step and i really am taking a huge leap of faith here.  i just hope i dont hurt any friendships or anything.  but yeah amy and i decided that we need to have another bathroom moment, which we do!  at the moment i feel like i could spend the rest of my life in her bathroom.  but yeah it seems we always have a lot to talk about.  im going to try to call her tomorrow before school to talk about more "stuff" plus we really need to talk about my last blog entry and we both know it.  but either way, in order to call her i need to get up and in order to do that i really need to get some sleep so i guess ill be heading of to bed.

      i guess it cosidered poetry but to me its just me writing on paper.  i just write thing down to get it out, it helps me deal with it i guess.     a fire inside it comsumes me consumes my heart, my mind, my soul it burns my flesh with a searing pain i go numb from the pain i awake; pure and white as the snow

      hi everyone.  at the moment im writing this in my bedroom at 11 at night.  ill have to copy and paste it into my blog after school tomorrow.  but yeah at the moment i just dont really fucking care about anything.  and if any of the people im talking about realize that im talking about them i really dont care.  i write this cause its nice to let people know what is going on in my life, but more importantly so i can talk and get things out.  i dont write this for other people, i write this for myself.  either way, it doesnt matter to me anymore.  i dont know if any of you people realize how much this shit hurts.  perhaps the only person i really ever feel comfortable talking to about this and now its so hard for me to talk to them.  did i ask for too much when i said i wanted to be loved?  is it really that much?  any person i have ever cared for either hates who i am or could just care less.  im tired of sitting here powerless and watching them.  im tired of listening to them talk about another person.  im tired going through this everyday.  i swear i have cried more times these past weeks than i have in the last three years.  people say they understand but they have never been in my position, they have never felt my pain.  in just less than a year and a half i can move out of this place, sometimes i wonder if ill ever see that day.  i know i shouldnt be thinking like this, but its not a first and old habits are hard to break.  im so tired of people making me feel worthless.  im tired of people being so disappointed in me.  im tired of people wishing i was dead and made the world a better place.  im tired of always being reminded of how im such a failure.  im tired of no one ever understanding.   I AM SO FUCKING TIRED OF ALL OF YOU AND ALL YOUR BULLSHIT!    all i ever wanted was to be loved...  so ill just sit here and cry myself to sleep and maybe if im lucky i wont have to wake up.

      1 Year, 5 Months, 2 Weeks, 6 Days.  so yeah.  in that amount of time i will be 18 years old and able to finally move out of this place. i will be so glad to finally put this place behind me.  ill be free to finally make my own decisions and do what  i want without someone constantly looking over my shoulder.  i will no longer be forced to hide books.  i will no longer be forced to lie about who i am.  i will never again hear comments about how the world would be so much better off without "my kind".  i will never again be yelled at for not being perfect.  i will never again be reminded about how i failed.  i will never again have to be criticized of every decision i make on my own.  i will never again be told what decision to make.  i will never again have to explain that i had something in my eye when i really was crying.  i will never again have to live here...

      *yawn*  im tired. i finally went to bed at about 2 in the morning but i really dont care.  the only problem is that (like nearly all sundays) i was woken at some god forsaken hour just so i can be told that people are going out and that i'll be home alone.  its like they could just leave a note or anything, but no they have to wake me up and all.  but wow, i LOVE my book.  its the second one in the "Queer as Folk" series and its about the people from the show (which i have never actually seen) when they were younger.  in the first book its mainly about michael and brian's senior year in high school and graduating and all that.  and about them being the best of friends and they are both going to different colleges (in the same area though) and all.  then in the second book, or at least as far as i've read so far, it starts them out during the summer and progresses into their freshmen year of college.  but yeah its a really good book and i love it.  its a good book on general but for those that dont know michael and brian are gay, although just friends and never anything more, and it just follows their lives.  its a really good book for anyone to read but for those that are gay or bi its so much better cause you can actually understand what they are feeling.  straight people can kinda sit there and say "oh yeah that must hurt" but if you've been in the same position you actually know the pain they are going through and why they make the decisions they do and go through the things that they do.  but for those of you who cannot tell yet i LOVE this book!  but yeah besides my ranting about my book and my lack of sleep the last 12 hours of my life havent really been all to exciting so yeah, talk to ya'll later!

      yes i going lyrically insane!! woo hoo...  actually i just love the lyrics to all these songs and i felt like sharing them.   "Screaming Infidelitites" Dashboard Confessional   I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have to speak, And this bottle of beast Is taking me home  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home.  I'm reading your note over again There's not a word that I comprehend, Except when you signed it "I will love you always and forever."  Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I were anywhere with anyone Making out.  I'm missing your laugh How did it break? And when did your eyes begin to look fake? I hope you're as happy as you 're pretending.  I'm cuddling close To blankets and sheets But you're not alone, and you're not discreet Make sure I know who's taking you home I am alone In my defeat I wish I knew you were safely at home  I'm missing your bed I never sleep Avoiding the spots where we'd have speak, and This bottle of beast is taking me home.  Well As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs And sit alone and wonder How you're making out But as for me, I wish that I were anywhere with anyone Making out.  Your hair, it's everywhere. Screaming infidelities And taking its wear.

      hello peoples!  OMG!  i have like so much stuff to do this week.  i have a chem test tomorrow and a test in both precal and spanish thursday.  i have a project to turn in for chemistry on thursday cause i wont be at school friday.  i have to write up some thing for spanish cause i wont be there friday for the stupid thing.  and i have a bunch of stuff to finalize for mexico.  yeah for those that dont know i wont be at school on friday cause ill be on my way to mexico and i get bck the following friday.  its gonna be fun.  ill miss you all though!  but ill at least have that saturday and sunday to hang out.  but yeah just a bunch of stuff to do between tonight and tomorrow.    i called bryant today!  i was going to see if he wanted to hang out or something.  he couldnt today cause he was busy with some stuff, but he said that he would probably come find me during lunch tomorrow.  for those that dont know, he leaves after 4th period.  but yeah he said he would probably stop by, and i might have a chance to hang out with him after school tomorrow.  if things go well during lunch i might see if he wants to go to a movie or something.  i probably shouldnt just cause i have a bunch to do, but ill be staying up late anyways so i might as well make it productive by working on all eight thousand projects i have.  i get to hang out with bryant so it doesnt matter  ^_^    i've never really met someone that made me happy like this.  i dont know what it is...  but once again i shouldnt get ahead of myself.  ive only talked to him a couple times and its not like we are going out or anything, its just as friends.  but hey, someday we might go out.  that would be so great.  so for the time being he is considered a "friend with possibilities"  ::warning ranting ahead:: grrrr!  my parents picked me up a little late from school today.  try 3:35 to be exact.  it wasnt horriblely late but they always complain when im like 30 seconds late.  so yeah i wasnt happy about that.  but then afterwards my mom decides we need to go grocery shopping. its not like she can drop me off at home first or anything.  so yeah i finally got home at like 5pm.  i was jsut disgruntled cause i really wanted to get home to work on some stuff.    oh yeh im done ranting now.  i just had to get that out.  for some reason ive been really tired the last couple of days.  yeah, ive slept like crap and all but this is a different kind of tired.  its really wierd, im not quite sure how to explain it either.  oh yeah, hopefully it will get better before i head to mexico.

      rarg!  i dunno, just being random  ooh, im in a good mood ^_^   guess who called me this afternoon.  bryant!  yeah that definately made my day.  he had to be at the school soon cause of the play and all but we did talk for a bit.   and omg!  he gave me his number and said it woud be cool to hang out sometime.  i thought that was the best.  im just so happy ^_^  and ive been making faces like that one all day.  oh yeah and he asked me where i hung out during lunch, and he said he might find me sometime just to hang out.  i thought that was so cool.  he really doesnt know me all that well and he's being really nice about things.  i dont know what all is going to happen and all but im still happy nonetheless.  so yeah that made my day.  so yeah onto tomorrow, and who know maybe bryant will stop by during lunch.  ^_^   oh yeah and one thing i love about being me is i can go out and point out stuff on other people yet when it comes to myself i just plain suck.  like fashion for example i can tell whether something looks good on someone or what they should wear but when it comes to myself i tend to look like a nightmare half the time.   but i can tell when people are trying to probe me for info.  its so much fun cause i know what they are trying to do.  it can be fun too.  but yeah i had a really boring day otherwise, but bryant called me so i was happy.

      *ugh*  i wrote an entry earlier which was fairly large cause i had summarized most of my week and i did a lot of raving.  but yeah the stupid thing screwed up and deleted it all!! so now im here again typing it all up again plus i have other stuff to write about.  not to mention that a little bit ago my stomach for some reason started to bother me.  probably just something i ate.  well lets see....  i saw bryant monday but didnt talk to him cause i kinda chickened out....  go me, way to be an idiot.  and tuesday through friday i didnt see him when i usually do.  i know thursday he was giving blood cause elisa saw him but i dont know why i didnt see him the other days.  i know he was at school cause he was there second period.  anyway, elisa called me thursday night asking if i wanted to go to the play cause she had an extra ticket.  i already had made plans to go with amy and andrew friday night so i didnt want to go thursday also.  elisa knows about my thing for bryant and she is also friends with him and she told me that she could talk to him for me.  OMG!  i was so freaking out.  so yeah after the show thursday elisa talked to him for me and she gave him my number.  ^_^  elisa is the best!  but wow, amazingly enough he actually called me friday afternoon!  im surprised that he called cause it would have been kinda odd, and im not sure that i would have even called if i was in his position.  but yeah he did call me and we talked for a bit although he couldnt talk long cause he was at the school getting ready for the play and whatnot.  oh yeah, did i mention he was in the play?   so yeah he asked if i was going to see the play and i said i was going that night so he told me to meet him afterwards.   i went to the play and met amy and andrew there and the play was really good!  i really liked it.  everyone did a great job.  props to bryan, nicole, and dina!  but yeah the play was good and afterwards amy and andrew left me all alone...  i talked to dina and nicole for a bit and congratulated them on a good job.  then i saw bryant.... ^_^   we just talked for a little bit, nothing all too exciting though.  everyone was right, he is really nice/cool.  but it was nice to meet him and talk to him.  so im happy about that.    yeah i have more to write about but ill do it later...  im just kinda bleh right now...

      ok then...  yeah this is definitely going to be a more serious post than others...  ive come to some conclusions about certain things.    the first of which is that after a lot of thinking and all, i've decided that i am going to tell my parents that i am bisexual.  im not quite sure how they will react though which is why i havent told them before.  im just really nervous about it all.  im going to tell them this evening and already im getting butterflies in my stomach and its only 1:30.    the second conclusion i have come too, i dont think is as serious as the first but is still really important to me.  i've decided that im going to ask this guy out.  he's so cute and such a sweetie...  *sighs*  but yeah my biggest problem is that as far as i know he really doesnt know i exist.  but yeah monday im going to ask him out, if i dont chicken out that is.  im not asking him out like on a date or anything, just see if he wants to get together sometime and hang out and see where things go from there.  but yeah that is another thing im really nervous about.  my second and a half decision...  because my biggest problem so far with coming out is my family finding out, after i tell my parents i feel that i just might be ready to come out to the world.  im not entirely sure yet but im starting to feel that if im ready to tell my parents i just might be ready enough to tell the world  my third decision is just the decision to let people know... in the last two months a lot has gone on in my life.  a lot of things that have really gotten to me.  some people have noticed that i have seemed somewhat depressed, and i have been.  im not sure exactly why im telling everyone this but i do feel the need to write it out and to let some people know.  yeah i have a couple close friends that already know but i need to not hide this.  but like i said i have been depressed.  wednesday i am going downtown to a youth support group for gay/les/bi teens. also, as many of you might have noticed recently there have been some marks on my arm.  some people already suspect but those cuts were made by myself.  it is not something i am terribly proud of but it is something that i feel needs to come out in the open.  to put it more simply, i am a cutter.  i admit that i have taken my knife and purposely cut my own arm.  i have not cut in nearly two weeks, which i am proud of and that is because i have good friends that have always been there for me.  but something like this is not a thing that just goes away.  i must live with the fact that i have made a total of 80 separate cuts on my arm all my life.  these last few months have not been by best and that i am ashamed of.  but as i mentioned earlier im not sure why i write this.  i guess i just need to get things out.    and for all of you who read my blog, thank you for caring enough to just pay attention to my life.  and thank you for just being a friend.

      well here is the entry that i typed up this morning but never had a chance to post:  grrr.  im so disgruntled.  the thing is, just about every sunday for so long i wake up and no one is home and i really like it cause its quiet i can turn some music on (without wearing headphones) and just kinda get some work done and relax.  and all that without having someone turn the tv on or makes lots of noise or talk or whatever.  its rare that i can have my music on when im not in my room, plus i can never do it while im online cause i have to be in my living room to connect to the internet and there are always people there with the tv on or making noise.  but on sundays i can work on stuff with music with a little peace and quiet and no one to bother me.  today i woke up and my dad was home.  and after he left 5 minutes later my mom and sister got home.  i know its nothing big its just i really love my sunday morinings.  i actually get some serious "me time".  and today i never got that so now im grumpy.  not to mention the fact that people are just plain pissing me off anyway.

      ~~remember when you're not training someone somewhere is and when you meet them they will win~~  ok yeah after 8 thousand posts im going to head off to bed.  its not really that late but i didnt really have the best night sleep last night and im tired.  i dont like sleeping.  i just always get the feeling that i'm missing out on something when im asleep.  just all those hours that youcould spend doing something fun and excited instead you spend in some subconscious oblivion.  yeah every so often you have some dream or something but other than that you never really know that there is a time between you falling asleep and you waking up.  it could be 15 minutes, 8 hours, or 30 years.  *sigh* oh well.  sleep is a necesary evil.  i call it evil cause to me its a waste of time, but like i said it is necesary otherwise we would all kinda be dead.  im just disgruntled at the way the universe works, nothing new.  but hopefully i can get together to do conditioning with amy tomorrow.  not to mention if have this stupid meeting i have to be at.  oh well.  good night all.

      ok yeah just so you all know im really in a writing/typing mood.  im just posting all this as i go.  but yeah i mentioned to my mom how i had lost weight and she told me that that was the same thing that happened to my sister a while ago and she lost a bunch of weight and it turned out that she had diabetes.  yeah thanks mom, way to scare the shit out of me.  ive lost weight over a period of time and it hasnt been a huge amount but it is kinda scary just to hear that.  but if i start to lose serious weight for no apparent reasont then yeah i will be scared but as for now i think im fine.

      ok wow thats wierd.  i lost weight.  for the longest time i weighed 155lbs then a while ago i went up to about 158 or something.  after that i noticed it drop to 156, 154, and now i just weighed myself and im 150.  either my scale is all screwy or i actually lost some weight.  nifty.  as long as im losing fat and not muscle.  last year i was in weight training and  just hope that im not losing that muscle from a lack of regular workouts.  and even so i know it wouldnt drop me to 150.  but still i doubt that im really losing all that muscle.  but hey im happy about it.

      well i didnt get a chance to run today.  and now i really want to.  i always have so much energy at night.  but yeah my parents arent exactly fond of the idea of me running around the neighborhood when its this dark out.  oh well, i definately will tomorrow.  i wanted to today but when i was planning on it my mom came up with the idea of going to to an early dinner and when i got back i felt too fat to go running.  and after that it started to get dark and now im here really wanting to run but cant.    well not much really happened today.  just kinda a lazy day for me.  it was good to have a day with no place to be.  yeah i've had a bunch of days like that recently which i really want to put a stop to.  yeah that probably sounds stupid to not want to have a lazy day to myself but i feel that i am not active enough and simply put i'm getting too lazy.  but yeah hopefully with a job in the near future and prepping myself for lacrosse i can keep myself busy.  free time is not a bad thing but having too much is just plain wasteful.  yeah im kinda giving myself a slap on the wrist for letting myself become so complacent, but hey someone has to whip me back into shape.  im not really out of shape but im too lazy for my own good.    recently i've really been in a big time writing mood.  yeah with all the events of the last month or so i've really had a lot to write about but still i've written a lot.  between all my notes to people, keeping a journal, keeping a notebook with amy, and just my miscellaneous writings i've used so much paper.  but hey its good to get things out.  but ive really noticed that i've been wanting to write a lot and not just neccesarily about all the stuff going on.  just a desire to write.  no, i have no aspiration to become some writer or journalist or something, im just saying that i've seriously done a lot more writing than i usually do.  plus i've written a bunch in my blog too.  i just write anything that comes to mind regardless of its importance.

      yay im happy.  yes im actually happy, miracles do happen.  but yeah im excited about all kinds of stuff.  i called cody last night and talked to him about the whole lacrosse thing and he's cool with it and he said that even though he really isnt that good of a teacher he can still help me with practice and stuff.  i sooooo want to do this.  and yay, im actually starting to be somewhat busy.  a while ago i had the problem of being way to busy with school, church and work.  now i dont have a job and i really dont do stuff with my church as much as i did.  but amy is doing conditioning for soccer and she asked if i would join her.  =)  i feel so special.  but yeah the two of us are going to be doing that, which is also good for me to get into shape for LAX and all that.  plus we are going "downtown" this wednesday, going to the school play, going to barnes and noble, and going to all the lax games.  well all the home ones at least.  yeah thats a bunch to do but i like keeping busy otherwise i get lazy and get too fat.  but im pround of myself.  im getting more active, more organized, and just plain more into things.  so yeah im probably going to go running at sometime today, but yeah talk to you all later

      ok hello everyone.  wow much has gone on.  for starters im actually writing in my blog!  and amy has been writing in her blog the last couple of days!  wow we are all a bunch of bloggers....   im just kinda bored right now cause everyone is at TWIRP.  i decided that i didnt really wanna go.  actually i never really could decide so i figured i would just not bother even debating it.  grrr... obscurity had once again entered my life.  ok in the beginning...  tuesday amy, beth, and i went to the lacrosse game in which cody was playing.  and oh my cow!!  i had a great time.  we won by the way.  but yeah it was so much fun.  but yeah here's my predicament.  after all i've seen of lacrosse and seeing the lacrosse game i'm really into it.  now most of you people are thinking what the big deal is.  well shut up and ill tell you.  so yeah i'm really into the whole lacrosse thing now.  soccer is a cool sport and i love it and all but i can never really see myself playing it.  yeah its fun to kick to ball around and have fun but i cant see myself playing competatively.  where as lacrosse i can seriously see myself out there playing it.  so yeah i look around online and all that fun stuff and at one point i e-mail mr. webster the lacrosse coach at BV about me getting started in lacrosse.  he said i could stop by his room during lunch and he would talk to me about it all.  so of course i stop by at the beginning of lunch and he kinda tells me how i can get started.  he said that sometime if i want to stop by practice i can kinda join in a bit cause he always has a few extra lacrosse sticks around and that if i bring in some blank tapes he can make some copies of some game tapes.  he also told me that although its too late in the year i can't be put on the team roster or anything but if i do good i can kinda get on the team as a non-player type thing.  now this would all be great if it weren't for one thing.   cody.  for those of you that don't know a while ago i actually told cody that i have feelings for him.  well a lot has gone on and my feelings for cody are a really bitch cause its so hard to find that equal balance of friendship versus feelings and it all just gets in the way.  well back to the story...  my problem with this all is that cody is on the lacrosse team and i really dont want him finding out about all this.  its not that i want to hide it from him or anything cause he is a good friend.  the problem is what cody might interpret this as.  saying "hey i have feelings for you and those feelings really get to me at times" and just happening to get into the whole lacrosse thing might seem like too much of a coincidence to him.  i dont want him to think that the only reason i am doing this is because of him.  yes i will admit that there is a part of me that thinks it would be cool to kinda be closer to cody because of this but i am not doing this because of him.  even if i did explain that its just too much of a conincidence either way.  i can seriously see myself playing lacrosse.  i can seriously see myself on the lacrosse team next year given enough practice.  but yeah i've actually thought of telling cody about all this.  i figure if i really dont have much of another way of getting into lacrosse without keeping it from him i might as well just ask for his help.  i just dont want it to sound like im doing this all because of him.  but if he's going to find out i might as well ask if he can help me.  so yeah thats my whole story about that.  but oh my cow i am so enthusiastic/hyped/excited about lacrosse.  anyway what else has gone on this week...  today nikole found out bryant's schedule!!!!  oh wow, i think i'm going to die.  maybe sometime cody can find him and talk to him for me.  that would be so great.  other than that i dont think much else has really gone on this week.  so yeah just figured i'd fill you all in since im doing nothing anyway.

      argh.  its been a while since my last post, sorry to keep you all waiting.   well here's an update:  i kinda met these people online and yes i know it can be dangerous to meet people on but dont worry im careful.  but i met these two people online a little bit ago and yes they are both gay and live in the area.  well i talked to eric first and after i while we made plans to go to the movies last friday.  later i he told me that he couldnt go cause his mom was being a bitch and all.  later that weekend i talked to will, who is really cool and actually went to BV.  and yes he is 19.   but he's really cool and we were going to go see a movie monday but he canceled on me.   =(    so yeah thats two people that have canceled on me...   well i met this other guy online too  ^_^  his name is brandon and he lives in the area too.  we havent really made plans to get together yet or anything but he is really cool.  yeah i know im such an internet slut.  but between the three of them im bound to find someone.  well i think that had been the most exciting thing really going on in my life.  we started the stupid STAR testing today which was loads of fun.  oh yeah i had a doctors appointment today cause ive had this pain in my side for a while and its really started to bother me.  but the doctor said that it was probably just some digestion problem and made a few suggestions for changes in my diet.  so yeah loads of fun.  i really need to get out running/conditioning.  well first i need to start feeling better but still, i am slowly running out of time.  yeah next spring seems far away but its not.  rarg.

      ok yeah.  im back!!!!!  from mexico that is.  i had a really great time.   im not going to write every detail though, just cause i really dont want to.  but yeah i got back last night.  today i went to borders books and it was fun.  there was this one guy there and he was doing music and he was really good.  not to mention really cute also.  but yeah he had a demo for sale also and i really wanted to buy it but i have zero money.  but yeah my parents did buy me matrix revolutions which is such a great movie!  and i got a new CD.  its Punk Goes Acoustic.  its really great.  its 20 songs by all these bands and they are all acoustic.  i love acoustic.  its so cool.  but im happy about that.    so on to the less happy things...  one thing that pissed me off so bad is that if i ever go on about how much my life sucks and how at sometimes i really just dont care, people go on about how they care and they dont want me to think like that.  FUCK THAT!!  if people really want me to feel better it might help to actually give a fuck about me.  they want me to care more about my own life when they dont even give a damn.  how do you expect me to care when no one else does???  you tell me that tomorrow will be better and not to give up when you are the one giving up.  if you actually cared you would might actually bother.  why do you expect me to care more than you do?  you call me your friend but you really dont give a fuck.  if i were to die tomorrow would you even blink?  you tell me to look to tomorrow but you are so caught up in your own life to help me there.  im not saying im going to go kill myself but if the topic of suicide ever comes up you go on about how much people care but you yourself can barely give me 5 minutes of your life.

      oh my god i am so fucking mad right now.  today was the NCAA college lacrosse championship game, Syracuse vs. Navy and i  *really*  want to see it so bad.  it came on at 11:30am and even though i was going to be up i wanted to tape it.  my dad said that he would set the thing to record for me.  yeah before you tell someone that you will tape something very important for them learn how to use a fucking VCR!  i went out to check on it and for the 1st quarter and a half it recorded nothing but black screen.  not to mention the cable box was on the wrong fucking channel anyway.  so even if it did work it would have taped the wrong channel.  so i threw a tape in our other tv and just hit record.  so at least i get part of the game.    how can someone be so careless with something that is so important to somene else?  why the fuck couldnt he have just done it right?!?!  fr once i just wish that someone wouldnt fuck up something for me.  i do a good enough job at it myself, so why does everyone else have to join in?

      well today was fun.  except it really wasnt.  i left my notebook at home, the one that has my paper and all my notes and work and stuff.  so that was really great.  not to mention i also left my spanish notebook at home which has my homework in it and such.  so that just plain sucked big time.  when i finally got home i went straight to bed cause i was freakin tired as hell.  i half slept for a little bit then i wake up to my sister banging on my door.  then she's all like, "oops, did i wake you?"  no, you didnt i was really standing on my head.  wtf do you think i was doing?    well i eventually got back up and got some food.  oh well.  oh yeah and i swear that people have nothing better to do than to sit on there fat asses and think up ways to piss me off.  its like some game, who can piss me off the most.

      grrr....  i'm having an emo day.  and other people are having a non-emo day.  so then our emo energies collide causing a great surge of energy.  kinda like when you mix matter and anti-matter.  darn you non-emo peoples.    at least for today stupid people are back to being stupid, thats for certain.  i like the way blogger actually keeps track of how many words i have written in all of my blog.  i dunno i guess i just like being able to say "hey i've written ---- words!"  i guess i just like being able to measure what i've done.  if i cant sometimes its hard to realize that i've actually gotten somewhere.  its a way to show that i've actually done something and its reasuring.    i figured out something over this past week.  i like attention.  i really do.  i like it when people actually pay attention to me.  i like it when i get messages from people from XY or BuddyPic.com   it makes me feel special, like i was important enough for them to spend that much time on me.    you know what really pisses me off a lot?  when i say i'm having a bad day, the first thing people say is "oh dont worry it will get better"   like fucking hell it will.  is that supposed to be an implication that things can automatically fix themselves?  thats not possible.  and if people knew anything about entropy they would realize that it takes work to fix things.  speaking of entropy, i still have an entropy project to work on thats due this friday.  not to mention the research essay for english.  and the essay for history.  and the two essays for econ.  and still the entropy project for chem.  that god, no projects for pre-cal, just homework every night.  not to mention finals are coming up.  wanna know what else bothers?  EVERYTHING!!  ok maybe not quite everything... but when people feel that everytime you get online they absolutely HAVE to IM you each and every single fucking time.  at it gets so bothersome.  especially when all they ever talk about is how bored they are.  EXAMPLE: them:  hey you:  hi them:  whats up? you: not too much, you? them:  nothing ~~~10 minutes later~~~ them:  im bored ~~~10 minutes laterer~~~ them:  there's nothing to do ~~~10 minutes laterest~~~ them:  im bored them:  well i have to get going, ttyl you:  bye  THAT PISSES ME OFF SO BAD!!! GET A FUCKING LIFE!! seriously do people have that pitiful of a life as to IM me and just complain about how bored they are?  get a hobby or something.  do anything besides sit there and complain to me.  i hate people that always complain.  yeah sometimes people complain, i understand that.  but it bothers me when people sit there and whine and complain but dont do a damn thing to fix things.  if you're so bored go to a movie or something, i dont care.

      ok well today certainly hasnt been my day.  why do i always end up fucking things up?  cant i do anything right?  all i wanted was for someone to care.  i need that... 'something' in life.  that thing that makes you whole.  i just dont know how to get it.  cutting made things feel better.  i know its not good but it felt better than this.  but i know if i go back to that... well its just not very attractive.  a lot of people dont want to have to deal with something like that.  its kinda interesting.  i can get sex anytime i want.  believe it or not there are many people that i could go to for something like that, but for some reason i dont.  i want to feel whole again.  i want to feel someone love me.  neither cutting nor sex can make me feel whole.  i know they can both make me feel better but not enough.  i can only hope that there is something out there for me.  for once i want to know that i did it right.  i want someone there to hold me and tell me that for once i actually made the right choice.  everything ive done up to now has gone horribly wrong.  i am here because of my choices, but just look where they got me.  why?  why do i have to be cursed like this?  what horrible evil did i commit as to earn me this?

      i've changed my mind.  i hate the stupid title things.  plus the color of them looks stupid and i can get it to change cause of the stupid CSS stylesheets are just plain stupid.    *sigh*  i want a relationship.  not sex.  an actual relationship.  i want a boyfriend.  someone who loves me.  someone who cares.  someone that i can hold close.    too many people are just about the sex.  yeah, sex is a good thing and all but it seems that is all that people want.  i dont know.  i just dont know.

      *sigh*  people can be really confusing.  you think you know whats going on then life throws you a curve ball.  stupid people start acting smart, smart people act stupid, nice people are mean, and so on and so forth.  i dont know what to think anymore.  what am i supposed to do about it?    im not even sure how im feeling at the moment...  i want to write but i cant put anything into words.  im confused; not quite sure how to react to things.

      people have a propensity to miscomprehend my inability to delegate "a fuck"  translation:  people dont understand that i really dont give a fuck   but yeah on to other news...  the boys! bryant:  he's cool, but we will only be just friends eric:  meeting him tonight although others have had bad experiences, ill judge for myself though will:  fucking slut brandon:  he's cool, but nothing will happen.  he might get with his ex anyway joey:  he's really cool.  although he is 21.  had a good time last night though  ;) kevin:  really cool, going to the movies with him sometime.  hopefully things work out ok  but yeah ive had a very interesting time.  i posted an actualy picture of myself online and i got so many responses.  somehow people find me attractive...  i dont get it.  some 39 year old guy e-mailed me yesterday, that was just plain gross.  the other day my lacrosse stuff came in the mail so im excited about that!  yeah tonight im going to a concert over at the boardwalk with eric, hopefull that works out ok.  he's really cool.  and tomorrow i might go see a movie with joey.  yeah people are stupid by the way.  and im hungry... oh well

      why does it have to come back?  after more than two months of freedom it just comes back in an instant.  but i made a promise.  so now i sit here, tortured.  its like being claustraphobic and im stuck in a small space but i know there is no way out and im just stuck here.  its like im suffocating and theres nothing i can do about it.  i dont want to go back to that again and i dont want to put people through that.  but i dont know what else to do.  its amazing how one small thing can set off such a reaction.  it should have meant nothing but it always showed what i have never had the chance to experience.    i hate writing all these emotional entries.  i just always feel like when i write it that people think i write it for attention or i want them to feel sorry for me.  well for those of you that i dont know already, i dont do that.  i dont want your attention and i certainly dont want your pity.    well im certainly not going to sleep tonight at all.  not like thats really a change from before.

      i hate it when other people are right.  mainly cause it means im wrong.  oh well.  i started work today which was pretty cool.  nothing all too exciting but oh well.  by the way i think i've fallen in love with polo shirts.  but yeah i have been thinking a lot lately.  which for me is generally a bad thing.  last time i really got thinking i had people knocking on my door...  but at least its not that kind of thinking.  just the fact that i wont be able to get what i want for a long time.  and im not a very patient person.  im really not sure what to write.  i know i should probably write something in here but ive been doing a lot of writing in my other journal recently.  just not a lot of stuff that i really feel like sharing with the world.  but yeah before i get too dramatic i think i will draw this to an end.

      Current Music:  Alice Deejay - Better Off Alone  i think its kinda wierd the way that a person can change moods so easily.  its like the seemingly smalls things in life can make some of the greatest differences.  yeah i suppose im in a ponderous mood right now.  well not really much to talk about at the moment.  well i did get cable internet installed which is amazing cause i can sit here and listen to all these cool interenet radio stations while browsing the web and download stuff all at the same time.  its really great.  plus there are some other great things going on too...  ;P

      ok i am so disgruntled at the moment.  a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away) my computer felt like it wanted to be a bitch and would randomly freeze every so often.  and when i say freeze i mean serioiusly freeze.  like there was absolutely nothing that you could do to change what was on the screen even if you sat there for 843 hours.  so eventually it got to the point where i couldnt get anything done and because i paid extra money for an extended two year warrenty at Fry's ELectronics i figured i would cash in on that.  i took it in and the dude looked at it and told me that i should try a full system restore.  for those of you who dont know what that is, it basically erases everything on your hard drive and resets your computer to where it was the day it came out of the factory.  so i tried that and guess what.  it didnt help.  so i try to do another restore and in the middle of that my computer freezes.  which completely sucks cause then i couldnt even turn my computer on.  so i tried it a couple more times and it would always freeze.  so i take it into Fry's and they say that because its still under manufacturer warrenty they get to ship it off to the company.  they tell me that that will take 6-8 weeks.  the bright side is that i get a loaner computer for the mean time.  well the other day i got a call from Fry's saying that my computer is in.... 6 months later.  so i go and pick it up, happy that i finally get my computer back.  so i was using it part of last night and today.  and guess what.  today it has froze 4 times on me.  which pisses me off cause i wasted 6 months and they cant even fix the damn thing.  yeah it turns on right and all that but how am i supposed to get anything done if it always freezes on me?   grrr....  well anyway thats my ranting for now.   on the bright side we are getting high speed internet this thursday  ^_^

      Current Music:  My December by Linkin Park  well i guess i kinda screwed things up with this one guy.  well i dont if i actually screwed them up but i know that now nothing is going to happen between us.  :(   its kinda wierd talking to him now.  i just kinda wish there was more...  but on a happier note, things actually seem to be going right (except for my continual boy problems)  i got a call last night and my computer is finally fixed and i can pick it up.  it  only  took the 6 months.  i got a job the other day as i mentioned earlier.  and today i found out that we are going to be getting high speed internet which is really cool.  so yeah some cool stuff is actually going on so im happy about all that  :)

      grrr.  i hate it when people take forever to reply to my e-mails.  especially when they are important and i need a response before a certain time.  and it bothers me when the people that need to respond are actually companies.  people get paid to read my e-mails and they take forever to reply back when they know i need the info by a certain date.  it doesnt make me happy.  *sigh*  just one more year...  ill be so glad to get out of this house.  i think i know where i want to go to college and i think it is actually feasible as long as i can bring my grades up enough to get in.  well where i really want to go i know i cant get in and i know i could not afford it plus the logistics just werent there.  oh well.  and i really wanted to go there too.  but i suppose i also have to face the facts of reality.  oh for those people who dont know i do have my happy moments.  i know reading this blog it might be kinda hard to figure that out but i can be happy.  its just i type in here more often when im in a bad mood cause it gives me a way to kinda let things out.  but yeah...  i slept like crap last night.  i went to bed at 2am.  i remember still being up at 3am.  i randomly woke up at 5:30am.  and when i actually did fall asleep it was a very light sleep.  i had the wierdest dream too.  anyone ever watch the movie starship troopers?  yeah well it was a cross between my trip to mexico, starship troopers, and the game called starcraft.  it was quit interesting.  its one of those dreams where you dont want to wake up cause you want to see the end.  almost like you are watching a movie except you're kinda living it.  but yeah im getting off topic.  i slept like crap cause i realized that perhaps my last hope had abandoned me.  wow that sounds dramatic.  but yeah, if that person happens to be reading this im going to look like a complete idiot.  but hopefully he's not.  anyway, for the first time i actually find someone who might actually be what im looking for.  they are caring, attractive, and they actually dont want to get me in bed after 5 minutes.  but yeah turns out there "friend" is visiting for the summer.  they are just friends but apparently he would kinda like it to be more.  so the time that i finally find someone who is caring, attractive, thoughtful, fun, funny, respectful, and just all around a great person and they have to find someone else.  i really had hoped that things might have gone somewhere with us.  perhaps the only person i have ever found that is actually cool.  everyone else is either too stupid, too slutty, does drugs or something like that, or just plain isnt my type.  there's always a problem with the people that i find.  and the only problem this time is that his "friend" is visiting for the summer.  perfect example of the losers i find:  this one guy IMed me saying he saw me online.  blah blah blah.  and like the third thing he asks is "how big are you?"  im sitting here thinking to myself  what the fuck?!?!    if that is all you want then get the fuck away from me.  and if the person i am talking about is acually reading this (i would doubt it though) then im going to look like a complete fool.  but yeah i've done a wonderful job at that for the last 17 years, so why stop now?

      for those of you that dont know its hot outside...  yeah im going to try and keep it short just cause its hard for me to sit down and write a long thing and sit still.  so yeah school's out which is cool.  i get time to myself for a change.  no more 7hr school days, projects, studying, homework, finals, and all that fun stuff.  and during the school year i usually spend half my weekends doing housework and chores and such cause i have to do it all for most of the week.  but now the chores and stuff are spread throughout the week so i get more time all the time.  so yeah i finally get some time to work on 'me' stuff.  which is like a first.  and yeah i spent a good hour and a half out at the school getting some good excercise.  yeah im perhaps the closest thing to be relaxed that i have been in a long time.  no more school to worry about for three months and i get time to get out of the house and the excercise is good to get stuff out of my system.  summer is wonderful.  oh and i might get a job!  they are opening a new starbucks up at greenback and madison and they are doing some kind of job fair or whatever they call it this saturday.  basically you go to the place, fill out the application, and get your interview on the spot.  so thats really cool.  i really need a job, plus working at starbucks would just be cool.  then when i get some money i can finally get my liscense.  then i could drive!  legally...

      Yesterday was fun.  Amy picked me up and we went to Starbucks and hung out.  Shortly afterwards Laura showed up and the three of us talked for a bit.  After a bit, Chris and Amy’s friend Jay showed up and Laura was heading off and Jay and Amy went to go pick up Andrea.  So Chris and I stuck around for a bit and eventually Cody showed up and shortly afterwards Amy and Jay came back with Andrea.  So the six of us hung out for a bit and decided to head over to the Fair Oaks part for a bit.  Cody, Chris, and I were playing a bit of lacrosse and Andrea even tried some, which was kinda funny.  =P  But the six of us just hung out and eventually went over to Amy’s house cause it was close by and we played Halo for a bit, which is a really awesome game. But after that Amy was going to spend the night at Andrea’s so Chris dropped me off on his way home and that was about it.  Later I found out that Josh stopped by shortly after we all had left and I feel bad cause I feel like I dragged him all the way out here and wasn’t even there.  So yeah I felt bad about that…  And Amy and I aren’t going on our beach trip today in case you couldn’t tell.  I ended up waking up today at almost two.  And to be honest, I think I deserved it.  I haven’t slept well at all recently so I just needed some rest.

      I don’t know what I should do.  I want to cry.  I want to scream.  I want to die.  I’m just so frustrated.  I was planning on going on a beach trip to get away from it all tomorrow but I don’t think it will be happening.  I’m such a dumb fuck.  It seems like nothing ever goes right.  All the crap covers up the good stuff.  I was hoping on getting my new camera today so then I could have it for tonight and for tomorrow.  But I can’t get it cause my sister is such a bitch and owes me $200.  So yeah that idea is out the window.  Then of course there is my beach trip tomorrow that probably is not going to happen.   I miss him.  I just get the feeling that I will never see him again.  I just feel like I’m missing out on a really good friend.  And now I think I am going to vomit cause this 43 year old guy sent me a message.  OMG get a fucking life.  And find someone within your own age bracket.  That is just plain disgusting.  Not to mention that I am such a dumb fuck.  If I weren’t so stupid I wouldn’t have these problems.  Why do I have to act so fucking stupid?

      The other day I realized something. I kinda knew it before but it didn’t quite hit until yesterday. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who want to get in my pants and those you want to marry me. And I'm serious every guy I ever meet either will want to hook up for sex or they get all close and after talking for 10 minutes think we are the best of friends and after 20 minutes think they are in love with me. And to be honest I'm really just getting sick and tired of it. Seriously, if that is all people are going to be like then I would rather not even talk to them.  But anyways, I'm sitting here getting fat and nearly falling asleep. I've just been so tired recently. Too little sleep along with school and work. It's mainly the lack of sleep that is getting to me though. Out store opens this Saturday which is cool, with our pre-opening on Friday. But other than that there is not a whole lot going on. I'm still planning on our little beach trip this Saturday as long as it's cool with Amy. I really hope so because I really need this.

      Hey everyone. I know it's been a while since my last update, sorry about that. I've just been a bit busy with school, work, and it just simply seems as though all hell is breaking loose around here. Well the other day was pretty cool. Amy and I went over to the school to hang out and practice a bit. Later Matt, Chris, and Cody joined us and we just hung out for a bit and had a good time. Then of course the sprinklers came on and that was fun. =P Afterwards Matt, Amy, and I drove up to the theater and left a note on Blake's car. Yes, I know we are weird. But Amy let me drove home which was so much fun. We stopped by Denny's first and got some food. I totally pigged out, but it was just plain fun. We dropped Matt off at his house and we talked for a bit outside my house and just got a lot of stuff off each other's chest. Even though it didn’t really fix anything, it did feel better. I went in the house and my mom had a little chat with me. Not fun. I have now had the "official" threat to be kicked out of the house. Not that it matters, in a year I'll be gone anyway.  But yeah today I was setting up the new store and I really like it. It's amazing cause everything is brand new and clean and it all works. It's like a miracle. But yeah, not a whole lot going on. I came home from work and just fell on my bed and went to sleep. I've just been so tired recently. I go to bed late, sleep horrible, and have to be up earlier for school and usually work right after that. But out beach trip this weekend will hopefully help. It's not like I'm going to catch up on my sleep but I can at least get away from it all and just relax for a bit. I'm so looking forward to it. =)

      Thank you Laura for your comment!  And actually thank you everyone who actually reads this thing.  I don't know what to say.  I want to write but I just have nothing I can write about.  I want to write but I guess I'm just so unmotivated to do so.  I understand why I am doing this but I just don't know what to do about it.    Amy and I are going to the beach.  Not today but sometime soon we are going on a day trip to the beach.  We both need to just get away from everything. Go somewhere where the world can just leave you alone for a bit.  I need to get away from it all.  I need to take a break and just clear my mind and relax for a bit.  It just seems that if there is not one thing going wrong it's another thing and I just simply need a vacation, even if it is only for one day.   I just wish I could change things that can't be changed.  I wish I could snap my fingers and make it all better.  Why am I cursed like this?  I know the problem.  I know what is going on.  I just can't do anything about it. I can't force someone else to understand.  I can't force someone else to change.  The only thing I can really do is just wait and I suck at that.

      Aly is the best!  She left me a message and when I got home it just kinda made me feel a bit better.  But yeah when I do get emotional (frustrated, angry, or what else) I do tend to say some dumb things.  I did kinda feel left out of the loop and I really do love you all who take the time to read this.  Well at some point this evening I decided that I absolutely had to get out of the house simply because I felt like I was going to suffocate. So I walked 40 minutes to go to Starbucks.  Not really my first choice but there was at least people there that I knew and cause I can't drive my choices are very limited.  I just wanted to see people and talk to another human being.  Well when I was there I was able to pick up my tips so now I have an extra 25 bucks in my wallet which is cool.  And I also got my markout which is pretty cool; I got  Decaf  Tazo Chai.  I really should cut down on the caffeine I've been having, although working at a coffee shop doesn't really help much.  But caffeine is bad for you in the usual sense that it actually does make you pee more and it speeds up your heart rate. But it just adds to a stressful situation and I don't really need that. Although it's not like taking caffeine out of my life will really make things all that much better, but it is at least something else I shouldn't have to worry about.  Well I have some good tea and some money in my wallet. What else could a person ask for?  Oh that's right a freakin life.  I'm feeling a bit better than I did before, mainly cause I got out and got some good fresh air.  Walking for 40 minutes did help clear my mind a bit.  But oh well, there is always tomorrow I guess.

      My hand hurts like a bitch.  But then again, that tends to happen when you slam your fist into a concrete wall.  Oh well.  It seems like the whole fucking world has decided to ignore me today.  Oh well, fuck them.

      Life is a frustrating bitch.  I know the problem.  I know what's wrong.  I know why this is all happening.  The problem is that even though I know the problem I don't know the answer or how to fix it.  I can fix things without the cooperation of other people and I'm not sure yet if they are even aware of what is going on let alone whether they will cooperate.  And of course I'm stuck with the problem of trying to explain all this.  I need to be able to sit down and talk about things but I don't know if they are willing to do that.  I hate feeling useless and I know there are some things I cannot change.  And hell, I don't even know what I can do about this.  I wish there was something I could do and fix it all so everyone could live happily ever after, but that is just for fairy tales.  Rarg.  I hate sitting here and waiting for things to happen.  Not exactly the blog entry you were all hoping for a I guess.  I know I'm being vague but there are some things that I'm simply not announcing to the world.

      Hello peoples.  Yeah, I've kinda had a complete lack of updates recently. Who knows, maybe I actually do have a life...   =P   Oh well, I'll update everything later tonight cause I'm heading out.  Just wanted to say hi to everyone.

      Ever have something that really just made you feel kinda sick?  And I don't mean that in the way most people usually do.  Basically it was something that kinda bothered me a bit, something that just really just kinda weighs on my heart.  I'm not going in to grave detail and it's really nothing to worry about or anything.  It's just amazing how you can see some people that can have it all- looks, friends, family, good grades, a future- but still be hurting so much underneath.  They seem like they have it all and their world is perfect but you can never truly understand what their life is really like.  No I'm not trying to allude to myself or anyone around me.  I was just talking with someone that seemed like they had it all and who knew what was really going on.  Sure you might see it in movies about the how everyone still has their own problems but its one of those things you can't fully grasp until you have really seen it.  I don't it just kinda got to me.

      I just bought 4 liters of Gatorade.  My life is just so much more complete. ^_^  So about my life... Amy stopped by this afternoon and we just hung out un my room and over all just had a good time.  She took me to work at 4 cause I actually worked today.  Nothing really too exciting cause I'm still just being trained but it wasn't all that bad.  I like the people I worked with today.  Too bad at the end of the month I won't get to work with them any more. =(  But for now it's all good.  Amy picked me up after work for some reason or another that I really don't know.  Her and Andrew just kinda sat there and watched me for like the last 10 minutes.  Boy that was fun. But otherwise work wasn't all that bad.  I got home and had the house to myself for a while which was cool, mainly cause I actually get to turn my music up and really enjoy it.  I completely forgot to pick up my paycheck and get my markout today.  It sucks having such a horrible short term memory.  But I can still get it all tomorrow cause I work again 4-8.  So yeah there really isn't all that going on with me, just kinda relaxing and enjoying it all.  I'm in a good mood.  Not quite sure why but I just am.  I guess 4 liters of Gatorade does that to you...  =P

      Mleh.  I just woke up from my nap so I'm still kinda out of it.  I'm just so tired from all this school crap.  Yes, I am in summer school.  Not exactly something I'm proud of either.  But yeah school starts at 7:30 which sucks then they want me to sit in the same class for 5 hours.  I'm sorry but I just can't sit there for 5 hours.  It just plain doesn't happen.  But yeah school sucks ass especially cause I have all these stupid people in there. But after school I went out and got lunch with Elisa as La Bou which was really good.  And I just had a good time cause we haven't really seen each other in a while and we were just catching up on things.  I missed my Elisa. =P  So we had a good time at lunch and at the mall.  I got home and just went to sleep.  I have more school than I do sleep which really sucks.  But yeah I just woke up and now I'm here.  I'm debating on whether I want to work on some stuff around the house, go to practice, or just kinda relax cause I'm still pretty tired and I need to be up tomorrow also.  Not quite sure yet...  oh well.

      Mleh.  I just don’t get it.  I know that I am probably over reacting for the situation but I just can't help it.  Impatience and uncertainty don’t mix well.  I don’t like sitting here and waiting but there is nothing else I can really do.  I've said all there is to be said and I've done all there is to be done.  But I am still stuck here waiting on other people.  I guess I just feel better knowing that I am in control; that I control my future and what happens to me.  I know I have to trust people to make the right decisions and I must live with them.  But still I hate sitting here and waiting.  It's just frustrating.  I just wish there was something more I could do or something I could say.  If anything I at least want to know what is going on.  After all I have done I still don’t understand where I am.  Once again it rests in other people's hands.  I know I've said it a couple times and I will probably say it a dozen more, but I just simply hate having to sit here and wait while something this important to me passes me by.  It's frustrating.

      Tengo dolor de cabeza.  I have a headache.  So yeah, I just feel all crappy right now. And once again my stomach is acting, which isn’t fun.    But on the bright side I got a call from Fry’s Electronics yesterday and they did find a problem with my computer.  Which is good cause it means that they can fix it.  So later today I am heading down there to pick up a loaner while my computer is shipped back to the manufacturer to get fixed.  It’s weird… on my computer I had 1200 songs but on the computer I’m using now I haven’t used in forever so I only have 122 songs.  I don’t know how I will survive.  I wish I knew everything.  Because if I knew everything that I would know what the problem is and I would know how to fix it.  I would be able to help people.  As corny as that might sound.  I just don’t like seeing people around me hurt or sick or anything.  I suppose I just wish the world would be perfect.  I know that’s not going to happen but I still want it to be I guess.  I feel pathetic.  Why?  Because I’m so stupid.  I am the smartest dumb person you will ever meet.  Next year I’m going to be taking Spanish 4, Calculus, and Advanced English Composition.  But I do stupid things.  I say stupid things.  I have no self control.  I never speak up when I should.  I can never say what I really want to; it always comes out wrong.  I don’t know… I was up last night just thinking (one of those bad habits of mine).  I’m really not sure what is going on with anything

      Argh.  I had this really cool opening line all ready but by the time I actually got here to start typing I forgot it.  Darn it…  But one the bright side yesterday I took my computer in to get fixed and the guy that I was talking to didn’t know didly squat about it, but they are going to run diagnostics on it and such and hopefully they can figure out what’s wrong with it.  While we were there I saw this really cool book.  Usually its $50 but it was on clearance for $5, which is really cheap for what I was getting.  It is a little old but it still gives me what I need.   So now I get to learn ColdFusion.  Every time I say that people are all like “what’s ColdFusion?”  ColdFusion is server side scripting and data basing.  And no, I’m not going into details simply cause I don’t want to and it’s too complicated.  So yeah, I got a pretty good deal.  Also, while we were there I got a book to learn Flash and it was only $23 which is still a pretty good price (some were 40 and 50 dollars).    OOH!!!  I just realized it but my previous post was my 100th post!!  Go me, I have no life!  =P      Oh yeah, I was told to stop by work sometime during the weekend and they would have my training schedule up.  Yeah I was there yesterday and they didn’t have it so they called the manager.  It turns out it was sitting in her car, so now I have to go back today.  The manager is really cool but to be honest she really needs to get things in order. But I’m only there until the end of the month, then my store will actually open.  And we get a drive through!!!  Woo-hoo!!  Ok that was way too much enthusiasm.

      I’m somewhat wary about writing this post because I just don’t know what some people’s reactions might be.  But then again I have said it before and I will say it again:  this blog is for me and me alone.  People can read it if they wish but al I have to say is read at your own discretion.  But on to the post…  I still feel like shit.  I think about what I lost and I wonder if I have lost if forever.  There is nothing else left for me to do about it though.  I guess I just have to wait and see how things turn out.  I can’t change the past and I can’t change how people feel.  I just have to work with what I have.  I guess I have a tendency to always fuck things up.  I suppose practice makes perfect.  But I get so close and then I have to blow things.  What I thought I had always wanted was right in front of me and for once it actually seemed attainable.  But like I said I just blew it.  I screwed things up big time.  I don’t want people to feel sorry and I’m certainly not looking for pity.  I’m just going to sit here and whine.  Why?  Because I can.  I will get over it eventually as I usually do.  I guess I’ve just become accustom to screwing things up.  But now it’s different I guess.  Usually I just try to move on with my life but now I’m just too unsure about what is going on.  I either move or things work out.  I don’t know if things can work out so I don’t know if I should just try to move on.  I feel like I’m stuck in purgatory.  I don’t know if I can get into heaven but I’m not quite sent to hell yet.  People from xy or something will IM me and talk to me and they ask if I have a boyfriend.  What am I supposed to tell them?  No, but I don’t want to go out with anyone else either?  But with all that has happened I doubt anything will happen anyway.  I know if I were looking at myself right now, I certainly wouldn’t want to go out with myself.  And it’s not like I was going out before.  Merely hoping.  Things were looking good actually.  I’m not sure how good but they were at least looking good.  But now I have gone and screwed things up (as usual) and now I’m just back to where I started.  I still hope for things to work out but still I’m not sure if they will, at least not after what I did.  Looking back I realize the magnitude of what I did and how that can affect someone.  Had I known what was going to happen I would never have let things happen.  But to be honest I really should not have let anything happen regardless.  It’s weird how some people can just motivate you.  Like I see the standards they set for themselves and how they act and I just want to be like that.  I want to live up to the standards they set for themselves and I want to be mature like they are.  I guess this is kinda directed at someone but anyway… 16 is just a number.  It only measures how long I have been on this planet and nothing else.  I guess I just wish things were like they were before I went and screwed it all up.  I just think where I would be now if I hadn’t been so stupid.  But like I said you can’t change the past, you just have to live with the consequences.    Rarg.  There are a thousand emotions that I wish I could put into words and put in here.  But there are some things that words just cannot describe.  Anger, frustration, care, sorrow, anxiety, hope.  Words do them no justice.  I just wish that there was a way to describe them; a way for people to see.

      [ooh, look another post.  I really don't have a life.  =P ]  I should just tattoo the words "relationship advisor" on my forehead.  I swear I give out enough advice to feed a family of four if I charged.  Don't get me wrong though, I like helping people and I don't have a problem with it.  It's just you would figure with all the advice I give out I might be able to make my own life work right.  I guess that's just the irony of life.  Oh my gosh.  It's almost midnight and I don't even feel the slightest bit tired.  That's what I get when I sleep in late.  I need to work on getting up earlier cause otherwise I'm going to go to bed late and it's just a vicious cycle.  And when school starts up again it's going to be horrible trying to get up in the morning.  Oh yeah and I was right.  I do want the other half of my sandwich now...  Once again, the ironies of life.  But look at the bright side: I'm cleaning my room.  Ever meet one of those people that just seriously motivate you?  Like you are just motivated to be a better person because of the standards they set for themselves.  It's weird.    Gatorade, pie, and good friends.  What more could a person ask for?

      i post in this thing way too much.  i really need to go get a life.  i think they were on sale at wal-mart the other day...   but yeah i had a pretty good day.  i talked to amy for a short while, its nice to talk to her again cause she's been gone and all.  also i had quizno's with josh.  quizno's it pretty good but today i guess i just wasnt that hungry or something.  oh well, at like 2am ill probably be sitting here whining cause i want the other half of my sandwich.  =P   but i so need to get myself a life.   i want to go make something.  like a website or do something with access or excel or powerpoint.  i just want to make something but i have nothing to make.  i like making stuff cause then i can look back and just kind say "hey, i made that"  i guess its a pride issue but i dont see how its bad to take pride in your work.  ooh!  good news, im taking my computer in tomorrow to get fixed (again).  but this time im definately going to have a few words with them about the fact that they took it for 6 months and didnt even fix the thing.  i wanna go out and do something.  with someone of course.  i like being around people, just not stupid people (like family for example).  i wanna go ice skating...  ok that was totally random but i really do.  its so much fun and i havent gone in a long time.   -Love, Peace, and Chicken Grease

      ok well at least im no longer confused.  well i still am, just not about what i was before.  although i kinda liked being oblivious more.  thats the one thing i liked about being a kid.  i was so naive and as they say ignorance is bliss.  recently ive been wanting to write in here a lot and its not like i really have a lot to write about.  i went to practice yesterday (miracle)  it was fun although i really need to be out there more often cause time is running out.  yeah in all my greatness i ended up hitting myself in the face with a lacrosse ball.  it didnt hurt too much but it did leave a mark.  but yeah that just plain sucked.  amy is back from kansas which is cool.  i missed you!  =P   life is being a complete biatch but even though i dont know what all is happening at the moment i just have the feeling that we can work through things.    blah blah blah....  i really have nothing to write about.  just me repeating myself a bunch.  i need to go find myself a life...

      I smile because I dont know whats going on.  i think thats on a shirt or something.  whatev.  but ohmygosh, the last couple weeks of my life have been crazy.  a lot of great stuff and a lot of not so great stuff.  there have definately been a lot of ups and downs.    *pauses for phone ringing* i think i feel like the biggest idiot right now but ok.  and once again i have no idea whats going on.  not like "oh i am so pissed i dont even know whats going on"  its more like "huh?"    like i am sooo seriously confused right now.  but i guess thats life for ya.   im on my other computer at the moment just because my regular computer felt like dieing on me (again)  and i just dont want to have to deal with it.  tomorrow im taking it in to get fixed.  but yeah im going to go now.

      At least I can smile now because all is not lost.  Things always take time though.  We just have to rebuild.  But it's something at least.    Ok that was somewhat mystic (or whatever the word is).  Just had to get that out of my system though.  But on a lighter note, Amy comes home tonight! Yay-ness.  I missed you!  =P   Well I'm in a better mood than before at least.  You know, I'm really not sure what to write.  I woke up sooo late today at around 1:30pm.  But I was also very tired.  What sucks is that I haven't been up long and it's already starting to get somewhat late.  Oh who cares, I'm going to practice anyway.  I haven't gone in a long time.  Oh and I love this thing.  I can e-mail my blog.  Like there is an e-mail address that I can e-mail to and it posts it in my blog.  That is so tight.  Now I can update it from just about anywhere!

      *yawn*  me want to sleep.  yeah i woke up at 1:45pm today.  i know it sounds lazy and all but i was really tired.  just a lot of bad nights of sleep and a major lack of sleep recently.  for one thing i slept like crap last night.  and i had this wierd dream...  actually i had four dreams.  one of them i really wish would come true though.  but oh well.  im just really tired right now.  i so want to write more but i have nothing to right about.

      i kinda figured out something.  well i actually realized it a while ago but now i just feel like sharing it.  it might sound vain and all but...  everyone wants to have sex with me.  i know i wouldnt be the first person to pick myself for something like that but hey, im not the one doing the picking.  but honestly i have a whole list of people i could call write now and we could "hang out" this weekend.  im just tired of people that are just around cause they want to get me in bed.  i want someone who can look at my personality and someone who loves me for who i really am.  but all the sexaholics are bad for me.  it puts me in a very bad position.  it makes it too easy for me to access and it just tempts me.  ive done some stupid things before and i have a knack for screwing things up.  but i just wish i had someone to love me.  not all these fake people.  it all just sucks.    on a happier note i got my blog set up so there is an e-mail address i can send to and it automatically posts it in my blog.  which is like, so cool.

      i feel like shit.  why do i have to be so fucking stupid?  i just feel like complete shit right now.  i hate seeing people hurt.  but even more i hate when it is because of me.  i wish i could just go back and change everything.  i wish i could erase everything i did to hurt you.  i wish i could be there now to comfort you.  i wish i had the power to make you feel better.

      Ok, so I’m doing this major cleaning of my room, just going through stuff, getting rid of old stuff, and just cleaning it up.  Well I was going through my clothes and sorting the stuff that is too small/old, what I wear and what I just don’t wear anymore.  Yeah my pile of stuff I don’t wear is a whole lot bigger than my other piles.  But its just a lot of stuff that has accumulated over the years or is just getting old.  People change over time and it’s I guess I’ve just changed.  Wow, who knew that sorting clothes could be so profound?  XP  But yeah I’m actually typing this on Word so that would explain all the capitals and proper grammar.  I know, it’s so unlike me.    But yeah a couple days ago I realized something.  I’m motivated by people.  I am motivated to take care of myself and to look good by people.  Like if I know I’m going to be doing something during the day I will put together something that I think looks good and I will take a good shower and I will just do my best to look good.  No I don’t try to get caught up with looks, I just like looking good cause I feel more confident.  And if I am running or working out or something I will be so much more motivate if someone else is there.  And I will just randomly clean my room out just cause people motivate me to.  People really are a great motivation for me.  They motivate me to work harder and feel good about myself.  I am just motivated to be a better person when I see other people (especially friends) out there pushing themselves and doing what they can to be a better person.    I’m so happy about my job!  Our store opens the 31st and it’s going to be so cool.  By the way, on the 30th they are having some big pre-opening thing where at a certain time you can come and get free drinks.  So feel free to stop by and get something.  I’m not sure what the time is but I’ll find out.  But yeah I’m happy cause it’s going to be a drive through and I just had lots of fun with my drive through at Taco Bell and Starbucks should be a whole lot better.  Plus I’m going to be paid $7.25 and hour and one person told me that I’m pretty much guaranteed a raise every 6 months even if it is only 10 or 15 cents.  Plus I get my tips each week which is so cool.  The person actually told us that if we are making $1.25 an hour in tips that we are doing something very wrong.  They said not to be surprised if we are making $2.00 and hour with tips.  I’m sitting there thinking “woah”.  Cause an extra 2 bucks an hour is a lot.  That means that I would basically be making $9.25 an hour.  But what’s cool about tips is that we get them each week instead of every other week and it’s just in cash.  So basically it’s extra spending money I get each week and I can save most of my paycheck.    Plus my manager is really cool and it’s always great to have a good manager cause it makes working there a whole lot easier.  And my co-workers seem pretty cool too which is great.

      i know what i want i just dont know how to get it.  out of all that has gone on i still havent found it.  i just really want to be loved.  i dont know really how to explain it.  but its just everything ive tried has failed.  almost as if it was never meant to happen.  sure i can have friends that say that they love me and all that but i want something more.  not a friendship love.  i want someone that i can love that i can just hold and be close to.  i just dont know where im going to find something like that.  i havent been able to find it in friends.  i havent been able to find it at church (i dont need any church lectures thank you very much).  i havent been able to find it... uh... 'with' people.  everywhere i go i just cant find it.  i cant find it online.  with some of the things ive done you would have thought i could at least figure something out.  =/   i just think of some of the stupid things ive done looking for what i want.  what bothers me the most is how i think about going back to them again.  like i mentioned ealier ive just been thinking a lot lately.  and i tend to write/talk a lot when i think.  and it seems like everyone is either on vacation or working so i might as well write in my blog.  i dont know.  i just talk a lot i suppose and need a place to get it out.

      life is wierd.  i can help others but really cant help myself.  for all the advice ive given out on other peoples relationships you would figure that i would be able to manage my own.  i guess its just easy to deal with things when you arent the one under all the pressure.  its easier to go tell someone what to do then to actually follow through with it if you were them.  but hey i guess thats just how things work.  but yeah ive just been thinking a lot recently.  it usually gets me in to trouble but this time im doing pretty well.  just the way people have reacted to my thinking (or my actions due to my thinking) and just how i have grown since the last time stuff like this has happened is so different.  my thinking has been more of a thoughtfulness instead of what it was before which is very good for me.  i guess its just how im growing and learning how to deal with things better.  oh wow.  i just said that im learning how to deal with things.  wow.  something i never thought i would hear myself say.  you would figure after everything i would become an expert at dealing with the bad side of life.  but really each time it has the same effect.  except this time.  i guess a lot of it has to do with my friends and the people that im around.  they have a positive effect on me and some of them can just help by standing by my side.  ooh this is starting to get deep.  i should probably stop now before my head catches on fire from over heating.

      ever have one of those things where you know something but it really doesnt hit you for a while?  yeah that just happened.  i already knew this before but i guess it didnt quite click.  but i am a very interogattive person.  translation:  i ask a lot of questions.  people could probably have told you that before.  and i guess i knew it but i never really thought of it.  i always want to know whats going on.  like every detail.  sometimes that gets me in trouble though cause i will get a little too personal and whatnot.  but its wierd cause i kinda knew that before but not really.  i dont know.  oh well.  i just like knowing what going on.  whatever.  im just wierd.
