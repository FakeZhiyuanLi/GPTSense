      Pete has fixed the window.  It even looks like the corner is original and not just rock hard filler!

      For those in the know, the paint work in our house is bloody atrocious - it's battered, scarred and quite frankly a disgusting shade of beige.&nbsp; Obviously then, it's got to be redo.&nbsp; Easier said than done, however.&nbsp; The top layer is thick and seemingly impervious to anything - nitromors is shrugged off and the hot air gun gets though but it still takes a while.&nbsp; So, I bow down to the new god of paint strippers - blackfriar paint and varnish stripper.&nbsp; Ok, it still needs two coats but that's about 15 less than nitromors and it seems to work instantly.&nbsp; I had a great day stripping!

      Well, I think I've been having a blonde few weeks - I have only just noticed the comment bit on the latest blog - and said 1 comment.&nbsp; Anyway, I have a look and my mate  urlLink Ledbum &nbsp;has been posting comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd never noticed before (Duh!) and so I've been and looked at all the rest of my posts - and sure enough there are the odd few comments.&nbsp; I have been so thick not realising, so thank you Ledbum for all your comments and no, Merlin was not propelled to the top of the shelving with a foot up the bum but she might have one applied if she keeps bouncing on my feet at night when I've dozed off to sleep.   So, the question is should I go blonde again - for D&amp;H's wedding perhaps?

      I was told, when I bought the latest printer that I had to get rid of the old ones - yes, that's right plural.&nbsp; When I bought the computer a couple of years back I upgraded to an all-in-one from an epson color stylus, and to be honest, it's not been right for me.&nbsp; The annoying american telling me whether it's printing or not (more often than anything, not); the temperamental waiting for it to decide if it was going to print.&nbsp; So, I bought for a bargain price a  urlLink hp6127  and apart from the fact that it isn't a scanner, it's great.  The epson was a great machine except that it took up most of the desk - a bit of a problem when your study is the same width as your desk - and so it went on eBay.&nbsp; It didn't fetch a wonderful price but it did sell for what I thought I could con a mate at work out of, so I'm a happy bunny

      The title says it all really - she was on her way back from a Golden Wedding in Scotland and called in.&nbsp; I think that she wanted to avoid rush hour but reflecting on her conversation, I think the trip had another purpose.   She's desperately worried about her mum, who we think has emphysema and possibly lung cancer.&nbsp; Not that either of them are telling.&nbsp; I didn't know what to say when mum said that Gran wants to go to Switzerland when she gets more ill.&nbsp; Why is it the words just stick?&nbsp; I don't want to think about her going - she's always been like a rock, but when we saw her a couple of months ago, she was thinner than normal and couldn't cope with a whole day.   When I can digest this information properly, I'll speak to mum again - it was only a fleeting visit but I think she's preparing us all for the worst.

      Bloody marvelous - just a week after losing the red swollen and scabby nose from the last cold, it is now raw again.&nbsp; At present it matches my red jumper - just cool!   I'm going to have a curry and a sulk now to try and get rid of it!     Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer(reindeer)    Had a very shiny nose(like a light bulb)

      Great, I've got Pete back again - I've seen him more this week than normal.&nbsp; And to cap it all, I've had to cancel going skiing as I've developed a nice little asthmatic cough.&nbsp; Brilliant - all I need is a couple of weeks on steroids.&nbsp; I want to be able to do a C. and get TB so that at least I can shed a few pounds.   Speaking of which, I tried on the dress for D&H's wedding and I don't think that I'll be wearing that - there is supposed to be an air of mystery over the bumpy bits and not being on display to everyone that glances your way.&nbsp; So, it's another trip out shopping.   The holiday is coming together nicely at the moment - I have no idea what day it is or even the date.&nbsp; Brill!

      Merlin deserves this blog all to herself after today's amazing stunt.&nbsp; I've been letting Giz and Mer play in the garage/outhouse thing - lots of new things to explore and the chance of a few spiders to eat.&nbsp; Giz had obviously got bored, because she was upstairs sleeping on a pile of clothes - thankfully not the clean ironed ones again!.&nbsp; Merlin, however, was having a mad half hour or so.   When thing went quiet I went to find her - wanted to close the door so that I could go out.&nbsp; And where was she - on top of the shelves that are about 8 feet up - head was inches from the ceiling.&nbsp; Now, the reason I think she's magical - how did she get there?&nbsp; I'm not sure that she could do the leap across the garage from the worksurface, but she certainly can't jump that high or can she?   The mystery will have to wait to be solved as they have now both been curtailed indoors for a while.

      Blimey - Day 2 of the holiday and I'm not slumped on the sofa watching daytime TV, arguing with silly people who air their differences on chat shows.&nbsp; Been quite productive again today - finally finished cleaning the masking tape off the dining room windows (only been on for about 6 weeks), and touching up the bits where I had painted the wall white when doing the sill.  &nbsp;  Thought that I'd get started on tarting up the woodwork in the hall but the sander was making funny noises - after Pete tried to fix it, he declared it was broke - the heat coming off the motor was quite impressive though.&nbsp; How it didn't set light to the copious quantities of WD40 sprayed into it to lubricate areas, I don't know.&nbsp; So that was consigned to the bin - another one is needed cos I'm not sanding ALL the woodwork by hand.  &nbsp;  Then we had a bit of a disaster - window in the extension blew open a bit more than obviously it liked, and the frame sort of parted company - not good for the glass though - need at least a new pane of glass but also a frame we think.  &nbsp;  To the good news though - always complaining about slow customer service and waiting on your phone bill.&nbsp; Get this - registered for a site today and they phoned me&nbsp; to put me in contact with a company within 30 seconds of pressing enter on the keyboard.&nbsp; Who are these gods?  urlLink One Stop 4 uPVC &nbsp;- totally amazing service.

      As a first day of a holiday it's not gone too badly today.&nbsp; I've managed to get some things done that have been sort of hanging around for ages - nothing really urgent or particularly important, but things I'd always said I'd do and never got round to.  &nbsp;  Managed to scan some old holiday photos into the computer - so when I get webspace sorted, the 1999 holiday photos will be there.&nbsp; As I'd managed to get all those in (nearly 90 photos) - I thought that I'd have a go at the panoramic shots that we had 'taped together.  &nbsp;  All the family photos that I've got are now on the system and tomorrow I think I'll have a go at 1998's holiday to Side in Turkey.  &nbsp;  All the piccies of bright sunlight got my wistfully hoping for a holiday abroad this year, but I don't think time nor money can be stretched that far

      First day of the holiday and I'm having to share it with Pete.&nbsp; He's had my cold and after two fairly sleepless nights (for me as well), he has decided not to go to work today.&nbsp; So there goes the doing nothing and pretending later that I was really busy.  &nbsp;  So, what is on the agenda for the holiday this year?&nbsp; Sorting out the hall and landing would be good - it's mostly stripping woodwork and paper and would really make a difference to the house.&nbsp; I was also thinking of doing the groundfloor windows outside - they are bound to look better with a coat or two of paint.&nbsp; Must go on a bit of a diet- bought a great dress for this year's wedding but need to shed a few pounds (more like stones, but realistically in 3 weeks can't do much!).&nbsp; Would also like to start going back to the gym - paying for the priviledge and don't use it - now no work to interfere perhaps I can get into&nbsp; a routine.  &nbsp;  Anyway, that's it for now - going to get dressed and get on

       I haven't changed the time at all - it really is 5.47  am .&nbsp; Why am I up?&nbsp; The kittens have been playing since 4 this morning and Pete has just woken up enough to throw a pillow at them which didn't help to calm them down.&nbsp; They have been hyper for the last hour - playing under the bed and with the shoes off the shoe rack.&nbsp; I wouldn't really mind, but I need all the sleep that I can get to delay the inevitable hangover from last night's leaving do.     &nbsp;   Hopefully, now they have been fed and watered, they will settle down a bit and I can have an extra hour's kip before getting up and going to work to sort out the hyper kids at school!

      And thank god it is.  The kids were slightly obnoxious today and it's only gonna get worse from here on in.  Seems to me that they actually get fed up watching videos for several weeks before the end of term BUT neither do they want to work .  It's a catch 22 situation really.  Thought I'd cracked it today with a nice little quiz set up on the projector and smartboard, but the laptop decided to throw a wobbly.  Good job I hadn't thrown the paper copies.  And that's another thing - the amount of crap generated.  We had the paper recycling bins emptied yesterday and mine's nearly full again of all the bits that I don't need and have been cluttering up shelves for the last year.  The kittens are in for a shock on Friday - the vets have given them a 3pm appointment - so it's thermometers up the bum time for them!

      We've had our two little kittens for five weeks now, and there have been several ups and downs (depending on how you look at it).  It's taken some adjustment to having two moggies running round the house and climbing the furniture.  But, nothing could have prepared for today.  Sitting in the front room watching Pete playing  urlLink LoTR2  on his PS2, when there was a little black blur going past the dining room window.  Yes, a cat had climbed out of the bedroom window, slid down the pitched roof of the bay and then jumped(although fell might be more apt) to the floor.  I've not moved that fast in ages, and Pete - well, he laughed lots.  We have one scared person (ME), and a very contrite looking cat (MERLIN) although I bet that it won't take long for her to do it again.

      Well at least it is in the study.  It's taken a week but it's finally all back together.  Pete says give it a week and the desk will look as cluttered as before.  At the moment, minutes after it was all completed, it's chic and stylish.  A first for me, I think.  It's been hardwork and needed a little tweaking in places, but it really came together when Pete laid the carpet for me this afternoon - amazing what getting rid of the horrible black thing did.  Only job left to do now, is to put the door back on - we left it off to allow a bit more room for furniture moving (not that you can move much in a room that's under 2.5 metres square!)

      Why do I do it - especially every time.  You feel fine at home doing bugger all, and so you go back.  Then it's like people haven't seen you for weeks and weeks.  Barely got through the door today when was collared by one Member of Staff (MoS) - didn't want to do a training session in the pm and in fact, wouldn't unless I was there.  Then my desk looked more of a bombsite than usual and trying to organise kicking out the person that should have been there was a bit of a pain.  Then trying to do the copying for the afternoon course while trying to teach gifted and talented (and I am really not sure why some of them are in there (g&t arseholes some of them)).  Lunchtime came and went - no sign of lunch though.  Then to cap it all my afternoon class decided that they would be hyper.  Oh, sorry forgot - minor computer glitch meant that we had to do some manual checking of data before sending stuff off to qca.  Didn't actually leave school until gone 5 today.  Great they've had nearly two hours free overtime and I've got stuff to sort for tomorrow to do tonight as well.  On the plus side, study is looking good but I'm taking my time to sort out the woodwork (it's always the bit that I cock up!)

      I am so better - I've actually got off my arse today and done some stuff.  Three loads of washing (and all dried courtesy of the very windy day).  I even did the powerpoint presentation that I had been planning for a while.  Hopefully it should make getting through the next ofsted inspection a little easier.  All I've got to do now is to do a prelimary mark on my year 10 coursework (but I might leave that until tomorrow morning).  And even better than all that (although most of that is pretty boring) I have nearly finished the bloody carpet for my mum's dollshouse.  I started this thing about 2 years ago (I think!) - and I reckon that once I find where the cats have put the pink wool, I could finish it tonight.  About sodding time too.  Mum will be thrilled I hope.  Gonna go away now and have a cuppa I think - might actually tidy the kitchen a bit - looks a bit messy after being off for three days.

      Having today off as well was a really good idea - i feel a million times better than yesterday.  You often don't realise how bad you feel until you feel better again.  I can actually contemplate doing the marking that a colleague brought home for me on Monday.  Was going to do it Monday, but felt so crap that couldn't be bothered to pick it up from the floor where the cats knocked it.  Speaking of the cats - I know what the little bugg.. darlings do during the day - they have eaten three flies, chased a woodlouse (where that came from, God knows?, run riot in the bedroom and investigate the toilet.  I am so waiting for them to fall into the toilet - it might stop the fascination that they have.  Anyway, suppose I better sort myself out for going back to work tomorrow - might even do some ironing today (although I am not sure that I'm that much better!)  TTFN

      Well, isn't flu lovely.  The scratchy throat, the runny nose, the green ... We won't go any further.  I've felt crap for the last couple of days and I am sure that the only reason that I haven't felt worse today is that I was asleep for most of it.  I wouldn't mind, but was going to show some of the kids at school the video about what happens when you have the flu - don't think I'll bother now - just go and cough over them and they can see it first hand.  Guilt trip has kicked in though - reading Monday's paper about  urlLink 'sicknote skivvers' .  Am I really ill enough to be off work - the head says so (it's thudding well) and the dizzy spells are not good.  I  On the good side, I finished a book ( urlLink 'Lots of Love'  by Fiona Walker) that will automatically make in on the  urlLink bookcrossing  list.  It's great holiday reading but not really my cup of tea.  Just spoken to my line manager at work and funnily enough, this close to the summer holidays, nobody wants me in to spread my germs.  So, I think an early night is in order and try and feel loads better by Thursday

      Why did the idiots that had the house before us, use gloss paint on the walls.  Just been up to check the colour coat before putting the embellishments on and noticed that the paint has cracked - in some cases very badly.  If I wanted a crackle effect I would have chosen to different colours to white and pale green.  Oh well, the light is pretty awful in there so don't suppose you'll notice later.

      Had a productive day so far - grass is cut, litter tray de-pooped, walls painted in study, some tidying done - and I feel crap!  Just had to pause typing to wipe the sneezes off the laptop, throat is sore and could happily fall back to sleep.  Why didn't I feel like this, this morning?  AND to cap it all, the neighbours are in evidence - I know how the previous lot felt when we were doing our electrics.  Gonna bugger off, get some sun, and try to feel better.

      Why am I up at 8.40 (actually been up for about an hour now).  It's the weekend and I'm knackered.  Put the second coat of paint in the study on at 10.30 pm - shut the kittens into their room and went to bed.  Started to watch  urlLink Quills  but had to give up cos tired.  So, what do the little buggers (called Merlin and Gizmo) do - manage to open the door and decide that 5 this morning was a great time to have a cuddle.  I managed to ignore for a while but got up to feed them at 8ish and what do they do?  They've disappeared somewhere - not playing in the living room so I suspect they are trying to work out how to get to the birds in next door's tree.  Ah well, they'll turn up eventually - like the hubby who is due back today.  Wonder in the stag has actually survived the whole experience?

      Whoever invented pink paint that turns white was a genius - apparent from the really dody bits, it's so helpful when trying to paint a room white.  A pity that tomorrow most of it will be a different colour, but at least the black has gone!  Hoorah!!!  I feel a problem coming on today - the kittens have been too quiet today.  Mind you, they were locked out of the painting area, so I think that they slept lots.  I just know that this is going to be another sleepless night.  Merlin has decided that climbing on keyboards while you are typing is a good idea and now Giz has come over for a look.  Gonna sign off now and have a beer or two.  Night.

      It's Saturday night and I have nothing much to do.  Hubby is away on a stag do and I'm contemplating a quick trip to the off-licence.  Debating whether I want to give dominoes a visit as well. Actually all those that know me, know that me going to dominoes is never likely to happen - online ordering is for me( urlLink www.dominoes.co.uk )  Well, it's been a quiet but hectic weekend so far.  Thought that I'd start by decorating the study.  Took three hours to remove the entertainment news and the times from the walls, and just waiting for the very patchy white layer to dry - it needs another three coats to cover the black walls and ceiling.  When we bought the house, the previous owner said that his son had done it in an artistic moment.  I know what sort or artist he is (if you get my drift!)  Not much else going on at the moment - new neighbours moved in yesterday, haven't seen them today; need to find out the gossip about a friend; and want to know if they have tattooed the stag.  Back Soon

      We're back from this year's wedding - D&amp;H finally tied the knot on Friday 13th. Most people would think that's a pretty apt date for them. But, the ceremony was quite moving and they obviously enjoyed themselves. They had the simple wedding that they planned and I think that they enjoyed themselves afterwards. We have all had a very pleasant couple of days at  urlLink Judges Hotel in Kirklevington  lounging in the bar in the evenings.  Yesterday we had a chill out day at  urlLink Fountains Abbey  - it was hot and sunny and we all moved about at a gentle amble. Pete then took us on a mystery tour and showed us a  urlLink druid temple , which unfortunately I've just told him is fake but it looks bloody impressive.  We left the newly-weds this morning (Duncan still hasn't carried Helen over the threshold) and made our way back. It was a good trip and Pete actually allowed a sight seeing stop for a change. So, I decided that I wanted to go to  urlLink Hardwick Hall . I can't remember when Mum and Dad took me but reading the guide book it must have been sometime around '85 - a long time ago.  We think that the cats have missed us because they have spent the last 5 hours running around like idiots.  I think that's enough about the weekend - the wedding party is next week and then everyone gets a chance to celebrate.

      Our Kitty Kats had their second set of jabs last week and are now officially allowed out - under supervision though as they haven't been spayed yet (and we don't want more kittens!).  Last weekend, Merlin was very brave and spent quite a lot of time in the garden but Gizmo wouldn't go near it - too scared of the cat next door. Which to be fair, is about twice the size that ours are, but almost as daft we think.  So, a little victory on Wednesday when Gizmo actually went outside with Merlin several times. And then, today, we have overconfidence big time. At one point, one disappeared into the garden that butts up against ours at the end, and the other was next door; then Merlin was on top of the shed, closely followed by Gizmo. And finally, Merlin managed to get almost to the top of the silver birch and had to be coaxed down. I think that their hour or so of playing out side was worthwhile from their point of view, but that's the last one for a few days.  They should have fun at home though, we are going to the D&amp;H wedding and so JP is looking after them - he came round last night for Cat Care 101 and pointed out that I'd forgotten a crucial instruction - 'find them'. They won't get too far, probably on top of a shelf or under the bed.

      Why do men assume that you know every little detail about what you they are doing ,despite the fact you have to remind them to do chores every couple of days. Strop over hubbies holidays sorta over, but the fact that I'm expected to remember to exactly how much time he's squandered on other pursuits gets me slightly.  Anyway, had a lovely pampering day - hair, nails and a jolly good relax, so don't really give a stuff. Have also decided that I'm going to book next year's holiday now so that we can actually get away.

      In preparation for the D&amp;H wedding on Friday, I've booked to have my hair sorted out - you know the sort of thing, dyed, cut into any sort of style rather than scruffy. And what's the weather doing - raining. And it has been since about 6ish when Gizmo work me up. It wouldn't be so bad but it's torrential. Well I suppose a decision needs to be made. Do I go to town on the bus (and therefore walk to the bus stop etc) or do I pay a fortune in car parking fees?  Too difficult a decision at the moment - going for a shower and getting dressed

      I have been informed tonight that hubby is going to have some time off soon - however, not until after I go back to school. Well, thanks a bundle. I'll have the 6 weeks holiday sorting out bits on the house, and organising the next stage of the redecoration and he'll have a week off at his leisure, when we can't do anything together because I'm back a work. I'm really annoyed at this as the original plan for this summer was that he would take the week after D&amp;H get married off and we would have a few days winding our way back from Yarm. Instead, we have to be back on the Sunday as he's back at work on the Monday. It makes the sum total of our time spent together this holiday (excepting the weekends when I'd normally see him anyway) 6 days, of which he was ill for 3 of them and miserable as sin. I think next year, I might just book myself a holiday somewhere and he can join me if he feels like it.  I'm NOT a happy bunny at the moment.

      What a glorious couple of days - the sun's been shining, the beer's been flowing and the barbie has worked  over time.  Great.

      Last night, the cats ate 3 daddy long legs', two moths and where chomping on something that I didn't see them catch.  I suppose that they just might be useful in keeping the insects in the house down.  Oh, and I forgot about the scrap they had over a blue bottle.

      I've just got back from the cinema watching the above film.  What did I think?  I'm a bit unsure - I think that I would have enjoyed it better if my mate hadn't given me some commentary about the film beforehand.

      After catching Gizmo sitting on the top of my clothes rail, I bought a wardrobe for the bedroom. Ordered it Monday morning (albeit at 2am) from Argos, Tuesday morning there was a phone call - are you in on Thursday? They booked a delivery spot for between 7.30am and 1pm (what is that about - surely with such a big time span, they could cut this down a bit). And I just knew that they would deliver the earliest they could. It's called sod's law - when you have time off they deliver as late as they can, when you are on holiday it's as early as they can. I set my alarm for about 7.15 - reasonable enough time to get a coffee and clothes sorted out. So, what time do they deliver?    7.05 am

      I've got the outfit for the wedding now.  Went to the bullring with J from school.  Had a great time.

      Well, I've finally done it. After all these months of moaning about having no webspace left, I have actually gone and bought a lot more. The site name will still be the same ( urlLink http://www.jogolding.co.uk/ ) but it won't be hosted on blueyonder's personal webspace - it'll be all mine. I think that I've got 600MB of space to play with, and this could be the spur that I need to learn how to do all of this stuff properly (Ledbum, if you're reading this, I'll need some help - the instructions have confused me already)  The new site won't be up and running for a couple of days apparently, but it's exciting

      I've got quite a lot done recently.  This isn't like the summer holidays usually are.  Today I actually got Merlin changed from a male to a female on her pet insurance.  It could have been interesting if she had feminine problems and we hadn't noticed.  I can just see the insurance paying up at that point.  I think that I've found a pair of shoes for the wedding - not sure if they go with the dress that I have.   I must iron it to try it all on tomorrow.  That way, I might get to go shopping again - I might treat myself to trip to Birmingham and do the new urlLink  Bullring Shopping Centre .  Better go - I'm trying to work on two computers and it's really not working that well at the moment.

      Had a great weekend (apart from putting 2.5lb back on that I'd lost - no alcohol next weekend then).  We got the broken windows in the cat's room fixed and I got three spindles on the stairs properly stripped. I know that it doesn't sound much but the effort that goes into this is phenomenal (it took 6 weeks to strip the window in the dining room)  Decent trip over to see a couple of mates, although I drank too much and ate chocolate for the first time in a week (naughty) Sunday afternoon at the Pilot was probably the killer session. I'm not too good at lunch time drinking and so the afternoon snooze was several hours long. Therefore it's not really a surprise that I couldn't sleep last night and at 2 am was ordering a wardrobe (I've caught Gizmo on top of all my clothes far too many times - what's the betting that they try to deliver when we're away for D&amp;H's wedding in a couple of weeks.
