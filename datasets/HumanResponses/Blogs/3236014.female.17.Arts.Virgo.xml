      this avril song reminds me of last year...no hate, just fun. we got some food at mcdonalds and ate it at the park. clancy bought alka-seltzer to see if seagulls really do explode. he smashed them up and wrapped them in bread and threw them at the seagulls. they ate them. they didn't explode. at least while we were there. we played on the merry go round. i was still eating my cheeseburger. i was the last one off, lying in the middle watching the sky spin around slower and slower. devon aggravated me trying to take pictures of me with his disposable camera.  why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?

      launch told me i can't listen to any more music for the rest of the month. they have stupid limits like that now. i hope they know i've been listening to it since 7th grade. they should give me special privileges or something. back in the day you could listen for as long as you want, could skip songs as much as you want, and like 2 commercials an hour. hell, they weren't even merged with yahoo yet. yahoo sucks. i typed all this with one hand. the mouse is sleeping in my other one. yea i'm bored. bitching one-handed over a freakin net-radio site at 2 am. at least tomorrow is the last day of this month.

      now i know what calculus is gonna be like.  just eight kids, in a room doing math.  we "smart juniors" are the ones left after the seniors got out in our math 4 class. now it's boring without the lazy complaining guy seniors.  i love doing the simplest things. how is that so when i'm such a complicated person? i guess that makes me even more complicated. walking for instance. this summer i feel like walking up to the very top of the hill/mountain closeish to our house.  and music.  i just sit here every night, listening to old bands, older bands, and newish bands.  i like staying up til the early morning hours.  i love sleeping, just don't get much of it...i especially love reading marshall's letters over and over again...hence my boringness and patheticness.   urlLink This guy is my hero.

        Emotional Wreck. You are extremely emotional. You feel contentment moreso than happiness and your emotional lows are to the extreme. You need to cheer up and start enjoying your life.

      the guy with the texas drawl and the girl with the southern accent join in. it's like stoners united or something.  I don't know their names.  but they say hi and talk to me. the texas guy keeps making fun of me because i "do nothing all day" and always asks me where i'm going.  three different times the girl goes outside and yells to the world that she isn't a virgin. that's nice.  but i saw lyle today. he's cool. a cool stoner. that's like an oxymoron. but he's cool.

      today was the geology trip. we went to the peoples' center first and got a tour, and then to lake macdonald. it was cool there. we went hiking for three hours. i wanna go do it again. the guys walked up from the path and pushed huge boulders that fell all the way down the mountain we were walking on. it was funneh. mr. rogers got considerably mad. i got a long lengthly phone call from devon late last night. he's good at telling me stories. and says it shouldn't matter to me that he smokes pot/drinks. but it does.  it turns into a lifestyle, one that will only bring me down.  i can't be around people like that for too long.  sure i can be friends with him, it's just that i'm not going to be his girlfriend again. i can't get too close to someone like that. everyone thinks i'm insane for not liking drugs. i guess i'm insane then. woohoo.

      this thing is messing up the dates.  "friday"s post had posts all mixed up from both friday and saturday. but oh well.  yesterday when we went to get movies there were these people in a car heading out of the parking lot and when they passed me they flashed this psychedelic "sexy" sign at us. i was the only one that saw it and i laughed.  i should try that sometime.    well, today we headed back home as planned.  it rained as usual. and we had that piano recital. it was ok. but emily freaked out and cried the whole time. i had to go before her it was so bad. and then my mom had to walk her up there. i'm glad it's over. but em's probably even more glad.

      i'm at my cousins' house.  we cracked open the coconut i brought and kyle video taped us trying to drink the coconut milk without gagging.  kelly failed miserably. she threw up in the backyard.  nick and kenneth almost did too.  kyle, emily, and I swallowed.  we are the champions.  i don't like coconuts that much, but it's just that they're so fun.  i mean we were throwing around the thing for like two hours beforehand. it's like coconuts make us drunk or something.  it was like passing around a really strong alcoholic beverage.  the tape was pretty funny.

      I got another letter from marshall today. and an email saying that he figured out how to send emails at school but he still doesn't know how to read them. damn. well...um...there was a cool storm today. with lightning and thunder. i have a headache.  i want a good night's sleep. my brother has to get braces. haha. i had to sell ads today. it sucked and i panicked the whole time. i almost cried. i suck. the WBC bought one though. but there was a guy at WBC that has a skin condition like my brother does, he(my bro) gets welts all over his arms if he goes out in the sun for even five minutes.  the guy said that he got checked out at his dermatologist and he gets shots every few weeks and it helps a lot.  now my brother is freaking out because they have to draw blood to see what he has, and i showed him the dimple in my left inside of my elbow from when they had to take blood from me.  10.5 days of school left...and i'm going to missoula tomorrow.

      most of our happiness is based on false feelings.  sometimes you just don't know why you're having a good day, it's just a feeling, nothing that's in the real world.  and if it's something in the real world that you're anticipating, it almost always never happens, or it doesn't turn out quite the way you wanted. sometimes the same goes for depression.  sometimes i just pass away my shitty days in a bad mood, for no real reason. on those days i think i should have every reason to be happy. other days they're just plain shitty because 'the real world' is a shitty place to be. i guess that's why people do drugs and whatnot. it gives them more false happiness. and in other words, all your feelings are pointless.  you can be happy or sad any time you want.  the only reason you can't believe it is because you don't have the courage to change.

      there was an awards assembly today.  i got an award for "excellence in journalism." i was surprised. i thought i'd just get a certificate for participating in it, but i guess i didn't.  i didn't know my peers thought so highly of me. i got a little newspaper pin too, which i will most likely throw in a drawer and forget about. the pet shop still hasn't hired me. i played catch with my dad after school. i forgot how fun it is. i like baseball. i don't like softball though. i can't catch a softball for the life of me, but i caught all my dad's flyballs. and any other ball. my arm hurts now. i'm not going to be able to lift for a week.  i'm so outta shape. bleeehhhh took that big test in US history today.  it sucked. i hope i got more than a 70.  i'm over history classes. next year will be worse, i know. damn it.

      just a little freestyle in attempt to cure world hunger...(?)  does happiness make you feel disheartened, forgotten? does love make you seem lonely, corrupted? i need a way out of here a way to find myself again a way to rid myself of the same old memories to free my mind from insanities i want a day away from myself where i can sigh away all my regrets i want to be alone so that i can be with someone again i can't wait for yesterday all over again so i can have faith in a better tomorrow just one more dry glance and i might drown myself i want someone to tell me the truth so i can quit lying to myself the more pain i can feel the more i'll feel worthy i'll be of something i'll never deserve happiness

      i'm just totally unenlightened right now...so i'm going to give you this day through the eyes of me.  my radio wakes me up at 7:15. i don't wanna get up but i do anyway.  threw on some clothes, went downstairs to eat a toaster waffle and a smoothie my mom made.  got ready to leave and drove everyone to school. dropped off my chemistry book and lunch in my locker.  walked past brandy and karen at another table.  sat at the table i always sit at.  levi waves, christina keeps throwing glares at me. the bell rings, i leave for mod 1 spanish 2. that class was pretty uneventful, walked back to the school the long way and it was cold, put my coat in my locker and cole said hi. first one in geology class.  shane walks in, skippy says she's surprised he's early for once, he says yeah and he should probably go out there a couple more minutes. he sits behind me but doesn't say hi. the bell rings. rogers talks about how meanderthals are related with geneology, tells us to go look for stuff on the internet.  i do what i'm told. shane goes over with skippy as usual. i try to ignore it and pretend to be interested in homosapiens meanderthalis. about 20 minutes later he sneaks over and says a couple words of what was on my screen. i felt like my fake interest in an ancient monkey man had been exposed. i felt inferior. i didn't say anything.  he squeezed my shoulder and left.  the tardy nazi man comes in and asks for shane. i take more notes. he comes back and tries to poke me in the stomach. i take more notes. i leave, pack my bag. eddy comes up and tells me something about scott's had too many pills. scott comes up and says he took three headache pills this morning and he feels numb all over. great, i think. smile and nod, just smile and nod.  the bell rings. get my chem book and take a chemistry quiz.  three fill in the blanks that i have no idea about, otherwise not bad.  chem book goes back in the hole, on to history where we listen to more presentation. briney says we have a big test tuesday.  i'm probably gonna bomb it.  then i get my lunch from the hole, sit down and eat.  brandy and karen whisper things i can't hear.  they dump their trays and leave. i finish and get my math book and do some chemistry homework til the bell rings.  first to math class. took a quiz on arithmetics and geometrics. third one done. i stare at the wall and think of marshall. the bell rings, half the class isn't done yet. math book in the locker, space out all the way to salishian room. mrs. woodhouse says to write down all our contributions to the senior issue because we just sent it yesterday. then she tells me to staple the point sheets.  as soon as i'm done she says we don't need them anymore and we'll use them for issue 6. i write my stuff down on the computer, everyone else is in the other room. lizz comes in with melanie and open the woodhouse tribute page, lizz shows me. this year she's marilyn monroe with the skirt blowing up. i say cool, smile and nod, just smile and nod. they leave. then they come back with mahoney, laughing their asses off. i couldn't come to a conclusion of what happened, something about kiel rafter. i really wanted to know. i printed off my thing and took it to the table where my bag was. the bell rang and i left. advanced studies...went to the art room to do my project. went back before the bell rang, when it did went to my locker. headed upstairs, glanced at the table where everybody was. they were all happy and talking. walk by, just walk by. gallop up the stairs. down the hall. through the crowds. through the parking lot and car exhaust. unlock the car. get in the car. turn on the radio and waited for about 20 minutes til my sister showed up. then brandy and karen walk to brandy's car, brandy notices me and waves. I smile and wave. they pack all their stuff in the car. brandy says bye. i say bye and smile. my mom finally shows up, saying she was looking for my sister. nick went to canyon's. she gets in and we leave. she needs milk and some dishwasher soap. we try to go to super one but half the parking places are blocked off so we go to sinclair's. we go home. i get on the computer for awhile. i drive to canyon's house to drop off nick's bag, then to KOA to cancel the reservation because the weather is bad.  the guy gives us a tour of the place.  they have four cats that are very friendly. gizmo barks at them the whole time. we leave and then watch joan of arcadia. that show is a whole lot like my life. i make ramen and open a can of peach juice and bring it down here. a perverted person IMs me, i shove him on his way and open media player to play music. then i go to blogger.com and type all of this.

      I found something to write about.  I was just talking to my friend about when I broke my arm.  Somebody pushed me at the skating rink, landed on my ass trying to catch myself between my legs with my right arm.  Then the lady that ran the place went up and yelled at me for 'sitting in the middle of the rink' and didn't even try to help me, didn't even notice my bent and swelling arm.  not like i could get up anyway, i had skates on and only one arm to get up with.  and the friend i went there with didn't really even care either, and especially her brother.  he was like yeah, whatever, you're just whiney.  my mom did care though.  she really did.  she's the only one who always has.  we went to the ER, the lady took x-rays and made me twist my wrist palm side up the wrong way.  it hurt like hell.  it was broken all the way through one bone and most of the way through the other.  later i found out that my mom had a dream about me breaking my arm the night before and thought it wouldn't happen.  the next day was thanksgiving.  i got up to watch the parade and my arm was really really swollen and my skin was digging into the fiberglass of my splint. that was just as painful as the break, but more annoying.  i hope they don't make splints like that anymore. it's retarded.  don't they realize your arm's gonna swell up when they make them?

      I feel like writing a great deal of something meaningful in here but I really don't know what...  Drove around some more.  My brother did the same thing and it's getting old.  he keeps talking about 'souping up' my car and i really don't want him to do that.  i mean he's 11 years old for god's sake. i need a new carbuddy.  volunteers anyone??  i miss Marshall like hell.  there's nobody to talk to at school.  but brandy gives me a one-liner every once in awhile just because she figured out i'm going out with one of her good friends.  so she thinks i'm 1% worthy now or something, even though i haven't changed at all.  the only one that changed was her.  i don't really like what she's become.  we used to be pretty good friends.  now she smokes weed, parties, does dumb things that she won't shut her mouth about.  how about talking about the meaning of life or something? it's a lot more interesting.  I feel like a hater.  do i sound like miss high-and-mighty?  i'm not.  i'm like...miss loser.  i've lost everyone.

      Dear Mr. Nobody,   Shane is an asshole.  I'm pissed off out of my mind!!!!  HOW CAN ANYONE BE SO DUMB?!?!?!!! AAAHHHHHHH   (I'll get over it.) (Just kidding.)  And by the way, I have no friends left.  Shane told me to my face that he can't be my friend anymore because his girlfriend is so god damn jealous.  What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  I feel like he's been bullshitting me for the past three freakin' years.  He was my only friend left.   Marshall hasn't even tried to get a hold of me.  I heard about him calling everybody else all the way last week and he hasn't even TRIED to get a hold of me yet.  nothing. I wish there was something to hold on to.  I feel like I'm the only person who has any common sense whatsoever. In order to find a friend, am I supposed to drink, smoke, do drugs, do the next guy I meet?...the answer is yes.  but no.  that's exactly what I lost 90 percent of them to in the first place. Mr. Nobody, you're my last one left.  You've been with me all my life, but I've tried pushing you away the whole time.  I tried to ignore you, to see through you.  I realize now that you're the only one who won't betray me.  Nobody is just fine with me, as long as I never turn out to be just like one of those people who take pleasure in watching me hurt. thanks christina, you've been so kind.  I take so much pride in crying myself to sleep every night.  I hope you find pleasure in making Shane buy you everything you've ever dreamt of.  Did you know that buying shit at stores makes me sick?? but more than anything, it's jealousy.  I've hated jealousy all my life.  It leads to hate, distrust, and way too much loneliness.  Jealousy is selfish and immature.  aren't you glad that I'm alone in the world?  are you smiling right now?  excuse the sarcasm, if you thought that any of it was sarcastic. Thanks for reading my crap attack, Muszzy. and Dan too, thanks for trying to be there for me...

      I'm supposed to get my car tomorrow or the next day.  We shall see. I was going through my cd's today and came across a couple that Clancy gave to me.  I listened to them again, they're pretty kickass. I'd like to bitch about a few people right now but those people are so ass-y that it's not even worth my time. Man, I really miss the old times.  I know I shouldn't be doing that...but seeing the way everyone has become just makes me sick.  Am I the only intelligent life form left?

      Hola.  I get to be home alone all weekend because I have too much homework.  it's so fun.  I took a bath.  I haven't taken one of those in years.  and I wore my pajamas all day.  and i ate macaroni and cheese and peanut butter and jelly and pineapple and sunchips and donut holes and sunchips and peanut m&ms and i listened to loud music.  and believe it or not, i finished my homework.  really.  i did.

      I hoard all the ramen and tofu in the house for myself. my dad says i'd make a good college student. in the car he says it looks like the weather's about to get violent. i say good. he starts laughing and announces that clarissa's ready for some action. the way my dad thinks is sometimes entertaining.

      i wanna go bash my head into a wall. maybe it's just my depressing music bashing its head into me, but i don't care. i feel like bashing someone's head into something too. i have horrible jealousy problems. i want to just lash out someday and make them all feel pain. everyone else's life seems so much better than mine. am i missing something in my own life? i watch people being happy so much, and wonder what it is that makes them like that, and what makes them so outgoing and lively. all i feel is blah, and leave me alone because i want to cry by myself and you deserve more than being in my worthless presence. too many people...acting like they're my friend for five minutes and then never come back. and me, just giving up so six years ago, the third time i moved. pointless, you're only going to move away again anyway. quit talking like that, you say such stupid things. don't hang out with those people anymore...they're looking at you funny, can't you see that? quit laughing, it's not funny anymore. and now it's like...why don't you ever talk? when you do, people laugh. you have a good sense of humor when you talk, and laugh. can't you just find some people? you know you're lonely. you're a human, just like they are...aren't you? nevermind. quit being so afraid. you used to be different. you were happy once...remember? don't you remember?

      hot tubbed during a lightning storm, walked in the rain, shoeless or at night, meaningless babble with my sister, found the first fossil of the day at the reservoir, saw a bitteroot, found my mom's lost camera, ate like a cow, gave nick the smackdown with beef jerky, conquered the van by freezing to death two nights in a row even though i had four layers, nunchucked the mosquitoes away, said hi to a fat prairie dog, walked across the big hole battlefield, visited my mom's old house in hamilton, found a nazi barbie forearm in the road and threw it at em, went to jackson-pop. 40, a guy i know from polson just happened to be there that day and recognized me as a guitarist, and turned my legs red in the hot springs.  and after all that, nothing in p-town has changed.

      i'm so tired...this is what goes through my mind. my old friend sarah's old house when me and jeanette stayed the night...we were the only ones there, the house all dark and calm, lit by the tv playing family values '98: korn playing freak on a leash, and me just as tired as i am now, and just as wired...devon running around with me on his shoulders last week...georgia making fun of my pants...shane's little pop incident my freshman year in math 2...Marshall and I standing in the rain, and some old lady gawking at us when we were under a tree...clancy never said ow, but arthur killed my thumb for over a week, god damn it...charleton not shutting up at walmart, and ashley saving me for about 2 minutes...poor charleton, getting floored like five times a class...this guy i met on launchcast back in seventh grade, and we're still great friends. he lives in detroit and his name is peter. he's so awesome. he found this little 10-year-old gothic girl in the middle of the night in the woods with his friends about a month ago. odd...eustacia's hauntings...this craig guy i met at the skatepark after talking to him on the internet, sarah went out with him after i moved away...and jessi erickson, sarah's newest friend after i left, and i met her when i visited a couple summers ago, she died in a car crash this january.

      man...i'm weird. i fought nick and canyon off the computer for half an hour while laughing at canyon getting killed numerous times, drinking sun tea, and throwing stuff at my brother at the same time. now i find out that i still haven't gotten that email from marshall telling me when he's gonna be visiting exactly...so my mom can't really help us out at all because my family's going on a four-day excursion out to dillon and he says he's supposed to be visiting at the end of the month...it's so vague. i hate vague. i'm so annoyed!!! ow, i popped my finger a little too hard...GRRR!! my head hurts. my mom's been asking me all this week for the exact date he's gonna be visiting too...well, if i don't get to see him, it's not my fault.

I can't get a job. not that i need the money, i've got 900 bucks in the bank that i never spend, but I just need something to DO!!! maybe i'll go out and pull some weeds tomorrow. or maybe take that hike to the minimountain behind my house. blah...devon wants me to go back to the colmans' tomorrow...screw that. that's enough battery drainage for me. in terms of both car and mind. i got my pictures back today. the ones i took closeups of different statues of the lady of guadalupe they were always blurry. always! it's creepy. didja know...i have the same bday as the virgin mary? that makes it even more creepy. and in a couple of them you can see smudges of light and stuff like that. my mom says they're angels. well, what else would they be? tonight is so boring.

      my cousin just sent me this. don't know quite what to make of it, but it's cool:   We held hands on the last night on earth. Our mouths filled with dust, we kissed in the fields and under trees, screaming like dogs, bleeding dark into the leaves. It was empty on the edge of town but we knew everyone floated along the bottom of the river. So we walked through the waste where the road curved into the sea and the shattered seasons lay, and the bitter smell of burning was on you like a disease. In our cancer of passion you said, "Death is a midnight runner." The sky had come crashing down like the news of an intimate suicide. We picked up the shards and formed them into shapes of stars that wore like an antique wedding dress. The echoes of the past broke the hearts of the unborn as the ferris wheel silently slowed to a stop. The few insects skittered away in hopes of a better pastime. I kissed you at the apex of the maelstrom and asked if you would accompany me in a quick fall, but you made me realize that my ticket wasn't for two. I rode alone. You said, "The cinders are falling like snow." There is poetry in despair, and we sang with unrivaled beauty, bitter elegies of savagery and eloquence. Of blue and grey. Strange, we ran down desperate streets and carved our names in the flesh of the city. The sun was stagnated somewhere beyond the rim of the horizon and the darkness is a mystery of curves and lines. Still, we lay under the emptiness and drifted slowly outward, and somewhere in the wilderness we found salvation scratched into the earth like a message.

We're harboring the meek Will we survive the sleep?  Unsure and scared We are planning our reprise Revolves around this world We don't know anymore The odds against us Yet we're stronger and prevailing Learn from mistakes Counting souls for sale  This question haunts my mind Will we survive this night?

      there's nothing to do in this world. i'm bored of everything. i'm tired of movies, fast food, sports, and shopping. there should be a place to just go listen to some good music. oh wait, that's my house. too bad i'm the only one here. people sometimes ask me if i ever get lonely, but the truth is i usually don't. i'm just so used to being alone. no one worth hanging out with anyways. except for that one person, and that one other person, and that person too, and maybe that one...  i found my japanese coins.

      weed is the nastiest fucking shit i have ever smelled in my life. my throat cannot swallow. i can still taste it in there. ick. no, i didn't do drugs. hell no.  devon convinced me to go to lyle's because i was bored (must have been pretty damn bored.) everyone was dying or streaking their hair black or mango-color for the rainbow gathering (lyle's family is kinda hippy). watched the very end of the second lotr in his room full of smoke. lyle would not quit smoking. joints, cigarettes, some thingy with a fan in it, you name it. finally got to go back upstairs and watch brandy eat lyle's secret ramen recipe. it's good. went for a walk in the woods with devon. that was fun i guess. then sat there on the couch watching cody play zelda. and play with the two little kids, elizabeth and something-with-an-i-in-it. they're cute. lyle called devon into his room to "talk" and after awhile came back up with his breath smelling like nasty holyshit weed. gee, some talking. then i decided to leave at like 11 and my battery was DEAD! probably from cody playing with my hazard lights...so devon found some jumper cables and started it and i left...damn everyone's asleep...i hope i'm not in trouble tomorrow but i don't think i deserve it. i went there and stayed there out of curiosity. i must be insane. argh, my throat. maybe i do deserve it. shoot me now.

      Lisa, I applaud your last entry so, so much. I totally understand. I've been there. Be strong.  I have the inkling to post the whole thing on here but that would invade your privacy even worse than i am now. I'm sorry...  This'll probably be the last entry until i leave for mexico...see ya on the flip side.  yeah, this is how it hurts, this is how it hurts...I wish I could get my words out the way you do. i guess it still wouldn't change the way people see things. fuck it. all that matters is i'm not like them. and neither are you.

      yesterday was the best day ever. a water fight, a walk, funny conversation, tons of insane meaningless things with my sister and her friends. i invited shane, he assured me the whole week he'd be there but just as i suspected, he was not. i laugh at the patheticness, it does not bring me down. it was the best day ever without him.  today i went for a walk in the horse pasture with eustacia to see the horses. it was cool and kinda scary because they were nervous around us and it looked like they were about to take drastic measure. tomorrow we will go to the harry potter movie with the rest of "us." i suspect that eustacia likes james. i almost did too but then i have to keep in mind that this guy is like three years younger than i. james is cool though.

      okay, i was kidding about the eating part... even though i made a blenderful of pina colada after school today and drank most of it. it was good, except my blender is like 30 years old and can barely even chop anything on liquefy. it smelt like an electrical fire by the time i was done. i also ate 1 egg roll. and 1 piece of chocolate. wow.  i am the notorious. i got myself in the back row once more before school got out for mr. hogie's class. that means i was one of the top five scorers on the last test. i was back there all of the first semester, but this one i wasn't so lucky. good way to end. bye bye hogie, have fun in las vegas.  i think i failed the semester final for math. crap. and i had to get in like the 90s to get an A for semester.  i feel like i'm talking to myself. gee, maybe i am. ¿te gusta pantera? si, como no! pero me duele el corazon...marshall debe escribir a mi todos los dias. asno!!(ese un chiste)  "you.. don't.. wanna be like me, don't..wanna be like YOU..."

      I slash you with my scissors  CUT !!!! brought to you by ben.  lisa has not written me lately. I fear she has fled from my pitifulness. it puts a sick feeling in my stomach.  I think I eat too much. you would think I'd weigh like 140 pounds by now. people still call me a stick.  beth gave them the don't do drugs speech today. go beth. amen. they didn't listen. too bad. it was funny though.  becky calls me claire in the hall. and I had a little conversation with some 7th graders waiting for the bus. they said my brother makes fun of my sister all the time for being quiet, and especially about the piano recital incident where my sister started crying and my mom had to drag her up there. her problems ain't his business. i'd like to see him move every three years ever since he was five until he was fourteen. or atleast do something decent with himself. not possible. in a year this shit will be over...and i'll be moving on to new, different shit. how shitty.   i might go to japan with billy for a week. we're raising money. too bad i don't have a freakin' job. I only have 900 dollars.

      that crap on the tv is so damn stupid. my dad watched that entire kerry speech, and yelled at the tv everything he was saying wrong, and now they're playing the&nbsp;whole reception. it's just a screen with about 45 minutes of fireworks on it, and LIVE in the top left corner. once in awhile there'll be a smaller&nbsp;screen with kerry smiling and pointing. and there's STAR WARS MUSIC in the background. what the hell.

      devon left me a message when I was in the shower..."Good Bye... Stay alive and stay happy..." not quite sure what that means.  I&nbsp;really don't feel good.&nbsp;I slept for three hours after work and my head still hurts.  when&nbsp;I was in the shower a big black hornet crawled up out of the drain and&nbsp;I didn't notice it until it was under my foot. I'm so glad&nbsp;I have a high instep.  I could have died today. when&nbsp;I was at work&nbsp;I was sleeping on izzy's (eustacia's sister, she's 1) pillow against the fence and felt someone's exhaust fumes. when&nbsp;I got back to work eustacia told me that someone backed up three inches from my face. I've taken a liking to that izzy. never knew I could like kids.   speaking of kids...eustacia's other sister, shannon, yes the midget, paid her mom a visit yesterday to say that she's expecting. the scariest thing is that she's with JAMES. no not my friend james, but the retarded one. eustacia was so glad she was over here when that occurred. I don't blame her...

      eustacia and i washed my car. then we used this wax stuff she brought where you have to rub it on and let it dry and then rub it off. it took an hour and a half to get it off! i'm glad it lasts for a year because that sucked! this is the first time i've actually sat down since 7 this morning.  i scrubbed out my aquarium yesterday, because i need some fish. they all died. don't ask how i got the motivation to clean that nasty thing out...but at least it's squeaky clean now.

      too many old people for my liking. all we did today was make fun of the customers. at least we got like 30 lugs of cherries sorted. we worked 8 hours with&nbsp;a 15-minute break.  i found out today that my (ex?)coworker, john koopmans, is mental...or something.&nbsp; anna came over from the stand and asked us what we thought of "the blonde kid"...and to us he's been very uptight,&nbsp;a little too&nbsp;polite,&nbsp;and there's&nbsp;something odd about him. and anna works at walmart, so she said that she saw him when she was working the photo part...he started flipping out because her machine wasn't working, then when she asked him how he liked the cherry job he&nbsp;ranted about how much he hates it (he hasn't returned since last friday either). then later he came back and demanded he wanted his camera back NOW.  ya learn something new every day.

      last week eustacia was sitting there crushing rotten cherries instead of doing her job, and the seed popped out of one. then she just blurted out, "if you squeezed someone's head like that, would they regurgitate their skull?" odd, just odd. we had to laugh at that for about fifteen minutes.  even though kelly sent me an apology last night, emily is now relaying me some of her messages and they're just evil. i'm mad again.

      psh. she figures it's me. of course now that i ain't trusting her no mores with that shit, of course it was. she's all pissed, thinking her and kyle are going downhill just because her name changed for like 2 minutes. OH NO  well today was just nifty. took my sister and eustacia to roo's house in ronan&nbsp;and we had a small bash. we went to mission mart and roo spent over 30 dollars on JUNK FOOD. can you believe it? and the ladies that work there were all&nbsp;grinning at us, and especially little roo pushing around a big shopping cart, filling it up with chocolate, and telling one of them "we're having a feminine party today!" well, we ate most of it. and eust and i drank&nbsp;the half gallon of milk in less than 10 minutes. em drank her water in even less than that. roo's hair is pretty cool. it's black and short with two long pieces in front. my mom wouldn't let me dye mine. she dared us to poke her second belly button from where they took out her stomach tube a couple days ago. eu and em said no but then i did and eu decided it was okay to do it because i didn't get eaten or anything. between the four of us, emily is the only right-handed person. it's rather interesting.&nbsp;roo has an ibanez acoustic, and it was way off so i tried tuning it by ear. it sounds good now. i played them the green day secret song from dookie. then they demanded to hear the actual song so i got my cd's and played it. then we played cards and talked about how much puberty sucks and watched a movie. with&nbsp;a bunch of demented chatter in between, but that's the best part. we went outside and made a really retarded obstacle course involving running the kitten in figure-8s&nbsp;through two sprinklers and worse. the poor cat. aren't 14-year-olds the best?

      yesterday there were these two guys that pulled up who looked almost exactly like adam sandler and jim carrey. usually it's just the same old bunch of old people, richies, and tourists. today a couple of people pulled up in a camaro with a mini-gizmo. it&nbsp;was really little.&nbsp; the other standout was a guy with a long pony tail and a metallica/korn/powerman5k tour shirt. and a guy that guffawed a lot. and a couple people on harleys. today was payday. we went out for shaved ice after work. they put gummy worms on top. what should i buy with my money?

      when i saw him, it was like he wasn't really there. everything blurred together and we vanished. we became the summer breeze. i couldn't feel his arms around me or mine around him. we were only together. we were one. and when the sun went down the moon shone on his face just as it did the heavens, and it was then that i knew he was real.

      on kelly's page it sounds like she's using everyone. kenneth for the babysitting money, nick for his "hot friends", and me for my car. that's the last time i give you a ride to see any of your trillian boyfriends. i wasn't even around&nbsp;kyle cooper&nbsp;for more than 30 seconds and i can feel the words of "i am a dick" radiating off him.&nbsp; burn.  she went back to castle rock today when i was at work. when i got back eustacia and i were trying to find where all my family went, and they were at top 40 and they just got done swimming at castle rock, but kelly was still there (duh). so we went there just to stalk and annoy her.  a good thing to kick off my job is a fit of rage. i worked like a machine&nbsp;the full seven hours without any more than a 20 minute break altogether. i forgot about all this then. i could go another seven right now, please.  &nbsp;

      i am feeling horrible. kelly asks me if i could take her to castle rock at four, and i sigh because i know she's gonna be meeting a bunch of retarded guys and say okay for some reason. i bring along everyone else too because we are now all in our swimsuits ready to jump in. we go. everything is fine and good until the boys show up. then she just stood there next to the rock staring at them, giggling occasionally at the bullshit they were talking about. at 6:30 we decide it's time to go and yell at kelly to get her ass in the car. her reply is "says who?" and the guys giggle along with her...at us. she says we can spend her $15 dollars on icecream just to give her some more time. we give in. 45 minutes later we're back...and she still says she's not going. now it's 8. i am raging mad. i tell her we're leaving. she says fine. she giggles at us some more with the idiots. we leave. my mom tells me i did the right thing. at&nbsp;9 or so&nbsp;she goes to look for her. she's not there. she searches the town for an hour and returns empty handed at ten. no call or anything from kelly. my brother looks up all the names of the people she was with in the phone book and we call them up one by one. finally we figure out she is with kyle. my mom is worried. my brother is ready to give her hell because that's what he does for a living. i hope she's getting raped. i hear her on the phone. they went to kfc. she's happy and teeheeing. i want to kill her. then she called up at 11 asking for a ride home. my mom is&nbsp;too kind. i can't wait til her parents find out.

      the three of us went to pier 93 to meet this girl (14 years old) and her cousin (21) we met on the internet. says she just moved here and wanted to meet some of the people. two idiots from my school showed up on bikes and talked about stealing stuff and beating up people. how interesting. eustacia finally gave them an excuse to leave and we ran down the alley and it was raining really hard and we went home the end.

      my cousin got a website. she's so boy crazy it's sick. she writes about every one,&nbsp; and everything about it, in great detail. it bothers me that people actually think like that. she hits on my little brother's friends for god's sake. i guess that's why she's so excited to get over here tomorrow, because it's my brother's birthday party and he just might have some friends over here. &nbsp; gizmo got stung on the ear by a bee today and she's reacting pretty badly to it. it hurt to look at her in pain like that, her head bent to one side and trying to shake it away every so often. my mom had to bring her to the vet tonight. her neck is all swollen and she's breathing hard. &nbsp; today was a nice day. spent it hanging out with eustacia and my sister. but we got pretty bored. we ended up sitting on the trampoline talking in the rain for a couple hours. tomorrow should be fun. the day after that i get to sort cherries all day with eustacia. &nbsp; i heard that venus is a planet just like ours. people live on it. nasa is a coverup, and the secret government told JFK about the large buildings on the moon and he wanted to tell the public. that's why he's dead now. the cold war started because they wanted to preoccupy the nation while they worked on covering up all the stuff they had just discovered. we've identified 18 species of&nbsp;aliens so far. the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter used to be a planet, but of course humans lived on it and destroyed it. we'll probably be doing that to this one pretty soon too i'll bet. humanoids on earth are an experiment. the aliens that created us call us 'containers'. one of the buildings on the moon is a giant antenna that transmits souls to and from the 'containers' on earth. there's an asteroid that could hit&nbsp;us on september 29, 2004, and coincidentally "nasa" says they're working on that anti-asteroid aircraft stuff. what a kawinkadink. don't have to believe me though, cause this is all 2nd and 3rd hand information. couldn't get it straight to ya cause...i'd be dead if i had tried breaking into that pesky area 51. &nbsp; whoa...amber is the color of your energy. whoa...shades of gold displayed naturally.

      I just don't know. it's really hard to type something after that, but here goes. the past two days have been pretty close to heaven, but today just got me thinking about my future. Marshall seems to know exactly what his thing is...i think i've lost all my "things"...damn it...i would love to study philosophy and art in college, but where would that ever take me? the tarot lady told me to just wait, because what is planned for my future can't be revealed until i feel worthy of it. that oughtta be a long ass time from now, because all i do is hate myself for not being able to figure out where i'm going or what i'm doing. today my mom got mad at me for being out with marshall til 3 last night. after he left, around 10 tonight, all us cousins loaded into the car to go bowling, but they said it would be 72 bucks just cuz it's friday night..screw that..so we went to hong kong harry's for the second time today and bought a bunch of bottle rockets, we decided not to tell my mom about it...then got a cheese pizza and a pepsi 2liter at pizza hut and took it to riverside...it was pretty funny, because we were talking about what a random bunch of kids we are, and how we always act so crazy around each other...it's probably pretty suspicious seeing us all driving around at 11 at night with the stereo all the way up, and staggering around laughing. and yesterday, i found a note on a kleenex in my car from devon, saying to call him whenever i get the chance because "we need to talk." I still haven't called him. i wonder what it is we need to talk about...and i remember last summer when shane and i were friends...i shot like 50 bottle rockets at him with a coke bottle, and he's out in the field with the baseball bat, fending them all off. a spark from one of them burned me pretty good, I probably still have the scar on my wrist..good times.

      (source:  urlLink http://www.ufos-aliens.co.uk/cosmicphotos.html )  The following astonishing conversation was picked up by ham radio operators that had their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA's broadcasting outlets. At this time, the live television broadcast was interrupted for two minutes due to a supposed "overheated camera", but the transmission below was received loud and clear by hundreds of ham radio operators:  Armstrong & Aldrin: Those are giant things. No, no, no - this is not an optical illusion. No one is going to believe this!  Houston (Christopher Craft): What ... what ... what? What the hell is happening? What's wrong with you?  Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: They're here under the surface.  Houston: What's there? (muffled noise) Emission interrupted; interference control calling 'Apollo 11'.  Armstrong & Aldrin: We saw some visitors. They were here for a while, observing the instruments.  Houston: Repeat your last information!  Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: I say that there were other spaceships. They're lined up in the other side of the crater!  Houston: Repeat, repeat!  Armstrong & Aldrin: Let us sound this orbita ... in 625 to 5 ... Automatic relay connected ... My hands are shaking so badly I can't do anything. Film it? God, if these damned cameras have picked up anything - what then?  Houston: Have you picked up anything?  Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: I didn't have any film at hand. Three shots of the saucers or whatever they were that were ruining the film  Houston: Control, control here. Are you on your way? What is the uproar with the UFOs over?  Armstrong & Aldrin: They've landed here. There they are and they're watching us.  Houston: The mirrors, the mirrors - have you set them up?  Armstrong &amp; Aldrin: Yes, they're in the right place. But whoever made those spaceships surely can come tomorrow and remove them. Over and out.  A certain professor, who wished to remain anonymous, was engaged in a discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium.  Professor: What REALLY happened out there with Apollo 11?  Armstrong: It was incredible, of course we had always known there was a possibility - the fact is, we were warned off! There was never any question then of a space station or a moon city.  Professor: How do you mean "warned off"?  Armstrong: I can't go into details, except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology - Boy, were they big!...and menacing! No, there is no question of a space station.  Professor: But NASA had other missions after Apollo 11?  Armstrong: Naturally - NASA was committed at that time, and couldn't risk panic on Earth. But it really was a quick scoop and back again.  According to a Dr. Vladimir Azhazha: "Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large, mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the Moon module (LEM). But this message was never heard by the public - because NASA censored it." According to a Dr. Aleksandr Kasantsev, Buzz Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs from inside the module, and continued filming them after he and Armstrong went outside. Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further detail, beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up."

      huge waves at sacajawea. 4 feet tall at the least, crashing into castle twice as high as it is. we jumped off and dived a few times, or just stood there and let waves splatter us. It was raining too. It was way cool until I died. I wanna do it again. Can still feel waves...joe bob gets annoying. SAY SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING. I screamed HIIII as we continued to walk far far away. I think he's happy for now. BURN  james says whatever you do, have fun with it. he's very sadistic towards girls. good thing I'm masochistic towards guys. I own a female siamese fighting fish. yah, female. they never have those at pet stores because they're supposedly not as pretty, but I think she's dashing. she's pink/purple with stripes. yes, stripes.  pointless

      this is the greatness of my life. we sang, in loud drunken voices, the weird al version of "complicated", which is actually an avril song, which was playing on the radio as we sang it. no need for one person to start, we both knew what the other was thinking and sang the entire song together from the very first word. "extra cheese..."  we all make fun of all the top 40 songs on the radio, including eu's mom. when they were playing that song where they say over and over "sugar sugar how you get so fly..." she says "well duh, if she's full of sugar and sticky ooey gooey, of course she's gonna have flies all over her!" I still laugh my ass off at that one.  and, eustacia and i can never make decisions for the life of us. "should we take tomorrow off?" "I dunno...do you want to?" "I dunno...do you?" "Uhh...It'd be nice to sleep in..." "Yeah..." "So...are we gonna?" "Um..." So after work we went to walmart to find an 8 ball to solve all our indecisiveness. We didn't find one.
