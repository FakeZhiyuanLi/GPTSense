      Okay, okay, I know I've already talked about  urlLink Firefox .  But it is truly AMAZING!!!!!!  If you're still using Internet Explorer,    STOP!    Like I said, they just upgraded to 0.9 and it has a lot of new features.     - Extension Manager - Theme Manager - Data Migration/Import - New Visual Theme - Better Bookmarks - Better Search - Smaller Download - Online Help - And a Bunch of Bug Fixes  Its nick name is "the build your own" browser.  You can change literally ANYTHING about the browser through things called Extensions!  There are over 200  urlLink here .    If you're still using IE and havn't used Tabbed browsing yet, it will change your life.  Well, maybe not, but it could possibly make you a bit more organized than having 400 IE windows open on your taskbar.  It has a great popup blocker!    My favorite Extension is  urlLink Adblock .  It will actually block most ads from your web pages! How great is that?  No more anoying animations on pages wanting you to buy their product when you're trying to read something you actually care abou :)  DOWNLOAD THIS NOW   urlLink Firefox

      I've decided to go back to my first love in web browsing.  For a while I went to an IE plugin that gave me some features of Firefox, but it just wasn't the same.   I've missed Firefox for so long.  The only reason I switched in the first place was because most multimedia sites didn't support it.  But now, I don't care.  Firefox is my web browser!  The just released the .9 version.  I am very pleased with it (the interface has suffered, though, I will have to go back to the original skin...).   mozilla.org  Until next time:  It's 11:45, do you know where your children are?  Love, Jesse

      This program is called: "Hello."  You can use this as a server to post pictures to your FREE "Blogspot" (blogger) blog.   The typical blogger account does not come with image hosting, although you can post images by linking them from other web sites.  With this program you can do that.  All you do is add the photo into your Free Hello account.   Click on "BloggerBot" and enter your blog info.  Then you just add the pictures and click "Publish" and they appear on your blog.  You then right click on the posted picture and copy and paste the URL of the photo into the following code:  img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='YOUR URL'  Be sure to put the carots on either side of the code (" ")  This can also be used a way to share phots between friends and family.  It works like an IM client only for pictures, just add your friends to your list and you will be able to share any photo you want.  If you are interested in a fun way to share the photos on your computer with others or want to post images on your blog download this program.  http://www.hello.com/  Have Fun! Jesse
