      so this is the first email i got this morning...   cristina:  Have any of you been in the attic recently? The door has been open for days. If there are rats, mice, birds or any other animals, the attic is where they will be.   chantal:  Have not, was open when I got back last Sunday night. Maybe it happened due to wind or whatsoever, will climb up there and close it.   cristina:  Let him do it, with a bit of luck he will break his neck.  i think cristina accidentally put me in the cc..... you know it always surprise me how low and nasty human can be.  i was thinking of writing a nasty reply but in the end i only wrote "that's very nice of you, cristina, it's great to hear 1st thing in the morning that someone who shares a flat with me is wishing me dead!"  am i pathetic? i should have go slap her in the face or something, hahahahhaha

      Was just hanging out with Perry last nite when we got a text from his friend that there will be 10000 centre court tickets available today!!! it took us less than 30 mins to rush home and pack our stuff to head off to Wimbledon. Got there around 10pm last nite and we were number 682 and 683 :D  After marking off our terrirtory in the queue we head off to find some food, eventually got some chinese takeaways from wimbledon high street, ate them off Perry's 4x4's bonnet.... not a bad way of keeping the food warm :D btw they charged us 20p for each disposable chopsticks!!!! Sorry for the blurry pic, my hands were slippery after all the greasy house special chow mein :)    It was raining a little we realised we got nothing to sit or sleep on so we went to the 24hr store, got some bin bags, stick them together using some tapes and build us a huge sheet of waterproof cover. Back in the queue around 12 and it was damn cold!!! my philly t-shirt blanket and grape werent really enough to keep warm, probably managed a couple hr sleep at most but it was fun though, havent slept outdoor for god knows how long..... Here is another pic taken around 430am this morning, it just became bright (at 430am in the morning!!), so this is the infamous wimbledon queue on a people's sunday.    I am so tired, will finish the write up of the main event tomorrow, so stay tuned!!

      so it's saturday nite, and i have been in my flat since yesterday afternoon, been watching too much euro2004!!! anyway, i decided to blog a little about my little sister, since the only thing on tv right now is discomania....     so she spent most of her teenage year in a school in lugano, switzerland, travelling around europe, making friends from all over the world, living in a room with a view,       i have been told she's a super talented photograher, she just graduated last month. while i was helping her pack up her portfolio, she was thinking about throwing away all of the photos she taken during her high school years!!! of course i stopped her in the hope that i will make some money off her precious first prints some day, hahahhahahha      thanks to her self protrait, she got into  urlLink parsons ..... great, she will be spending the next 4 yrs in nyc, now i am getting really jealous!       sometimes i wonder if she realised how lucky she is..... btw, little sis, congratz on finishing highschool and i am so proud of you.

      some reflection from today's GGF  urlLink WSRF  update session.  it seems that the aim of WSRF is to provide a formal model for states in (WS focused) distributed systems. Porviding a formal model is definately a good thing, however the WSRF spec is kind of noisy, consists of 6 sub spec and some of them seems unrelated to the aim. e.g. fault handling, service group. what are they to do with a formal state model??  during  urlLink David Snelling 's presentation he gave 3 examples of how we could use WSRF, but all of the examples can be implemented by other specs, so as ppl in the session duely pointed out, WHAT IS THE POINT??

      so i am in hawaii this week attending  urlLink GGF11 , i was hoping to post some pictures but the damn firewire connectors!!!! who the hell invented firewire?? why does it have to have so many different  (4, 6, 9 pin) connectors?!?!?!? my cable for videocamera doesn't fit my gf's camera, so i can't transfer pics onto my laptop....  ok that's my angry venting, but can't complaint, hawaii is such a beautiful place, hopefully i will get to see more of it once the conference is done.
