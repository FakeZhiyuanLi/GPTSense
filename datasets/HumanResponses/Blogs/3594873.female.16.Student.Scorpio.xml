      Okay, so where did we leave you guys? Oh yeah, we just told you our names and we let you guys see us chatting. Well, where do we live? We live in the “scary” Middle East. Speaking of living, you know, I’m sure you’re all aware of the fact that there are seven characteristics an organism has to have/ perform in order to be considered alive. They are: responding to stimuli in the environment, …………….(skip the other 5 characteristics), and breathing. Now, you know those people who are on respirators? Are they considered to be alive; because in reality, they are not the ones actually performing the function of breathing. I feel really horrible for all their relatives who have to go through so much pain, but I’m just curious. Are they considered living? And now for our little story about life…  The story takes place in nowhere. A place very familiar to lots of persons- especially nobody. Nobody who does nothing all the time in this nowhere. Night and day- nothing.  But this is the story the way I heard it straight from somebody’s mouth, and I can’t change one bit of it.   The story begins with crying and ends with crying. The middle is laughter. Like life: the first moment we breathe, we cry because of the world we have just entered and the one that we have just left. And when we are dead, our relatives cry. But in the middle, we laugh.   If I have gotten your attention now, if I have sucked it from you, inspired you, then nothing. I don’t care. Because if I told you, well then, it would be a something, and this story- this story is a nothing.   Now for some serious thoughts: Those people at the airport. You know who I’m talking about, right? Those serious men who stand and take your passport from you, like it’s a bomb, those men. They open up to your picture and begin to stare at it. They have to concentrate very hard- their head turns from the picture on the passport to your face and back. Like a dog whose shaking its head to get rid of water. Now, these people bother me. They irritate me. I mean, do they have some kind of make up/ disguise education? Are they very talented artistic people or something? I mean, somebody trying to escape or use a different passport isn’t going to be stupid. He/ she is going to transform themselves so that they look exactly like the picture. And these people are dressed up like police officers…(over here, at least). What’s with that? What kind of a police officer gets stuck with that job? Looking at pictures all the day. “Oh, look!! I found a criminal!” “I swear its me. I swear, I just got a pimple attack, but that is me.” “Get out here, and have a good, safe trip.” Who needs these stupid police officers?!  Oh! Since I wrote that the police officers look like dogs, I just wanted to say, that all of you people are dogs. Yes, you are my dogs….seriously, since everyone goes like “dogs are so lovable. They’re a man’s best friend. They are loyal and sweet. They are so affectionate”, if they are all that, then why do people get insulted when someone says “hey b****?” Shouldn’t we think of it as a compliment? And, why is it the female dog is an insult? What’s so bad about a female dog? Why is their name taken to mean something horrible?   Speaking of weird language and stuff: What is with the expression: time on your hands: if I had time on my hands,  I would go and wash my hands, rinse off all the bad times, cleanse off all the embarrassing times…..erase all the times that when I think about them, I shiver and can feel waves heaving and rolling in my stomach.  Times that if I think too much about, I feel regret that matures into a full grown tree, and I wish that I could just go back and change it… yeah, if I had time on my hands, then I would wash it off, so I wouldn’t have time on my hands anymore.  Oh hey, if you guys have some time on your hands, comment on the post :P :P.   What I just wrote reminded me of something else I thought about before. You know how I wrote I would erase all the bad times. Well, I wouldn’t really because I don’t know how an eraser works. I truly have no clue to the mysterious functional capabilities of an eraser……..i don’t even want to think about how an ATM machine works. No wait, I do. How does it give us money back? How does it know how much to give? I know it has to do with electronics. That scary world! I don’t want to know anymore...natasha, cut the engineering lecture. I said I don’t want to know.   Natasha is my imaginary friend. She thinks you guyz have some mental issues. :D But I’ll tell you who has  real, major problems… a dentist. They have major issues. I mean, who grows up wanting to stick their head in somebody’s mouth and look at all the disgusting stuff stuck there. That’s if they even make it there…someone’s bad breath might just be a toxic chemical that surrounds the dentist chocking him/ her and preventing him/ her from breathing until the dentist turns red and finally departs from this world. Then to look at all of those brilliant white teeth that have been stained by coffee, soda, and everything else a dentist hates until they have become yellow. Next, the cavities. You see where I’m getting at?   And dentists are the biggest liars. They all say, “Open up your mouth. It’s not going to hurt you a bit.” Excuse me, if it looks like a drill, sounds like a drill…well than it is a drill that’s going into my mouth. But hey, yeah, it doesn’t hurt…actually you can’t feel anything if you get those shots that don’t let you feel; (I can’t seem to spell it) But oh my jumping, sprouting, spinach balls. Have you ever gotten one of those? Those shots are the most painful thing, ever. I swear, it feels like somebody is pushing something down into your mouth and the pain just goes directly to your brain.   That is if you have a brain? Gotta go…its time to save the world/ or maybe it was take over the (Hey, don’t tell them!!)

      Spring is here. Its bright light shines, warming the sky. Its gentle, soft breeze embraces the dancing trees. The sky is blue, a clear blue that speaks of children playing in the park and family picnics. The flowers wake up from their long hibernation and gently unfold, facing the powerful sun’s rays. Birds chirp and sing to each other of romance. A caterpillar fights desperately pushing its cocoon, its wrapped blanket, and emerges as a splendid butterfly gliding the waves of air ever so lightly. Bees hover over their hives, busy work stations, producing sweet, golden honey.   Winter is gone, shed like a snake’s skin for spring. Its spotless coat put away in the closet.   Amina:  And then, I wake up from the terrible nightmare I was having, and find to my joy that all is well with the world. There is still the pungent smell of smoke, a layer of smog covering the sky, and dead birds falling from the sky. Yes, Chicken Liken was wrong: the sky was not falling: it was just the beautiful world on one of its regular routine days… (sniffs the nice smell of pollution and feels once again refreshed.)   Mariam:  My poor darling aMinA. Chicken Licken was incorrect in her assumption as are you. It is neither the sky falling nor the smoke which has created such drastic changes in our country so rapidly, and with no warning. No, you’re both wrong.   Amina:  You know my insignificant one, that chicken licken has an usual name. I doubt anyone would want to be eaten, and yet she calls herself “licken.” However, that is not as strange as the name “winnie the pooh.” Please explain to me the significance of having the word pooh inside the name… Aaah, I have realized I didn’t ask you the reason you are so convinced of my wrongness.    Mariam:  Why you are wrong:  It is simply because Winnie the Pooh ate up all the honey and then had to go do doo doo. So a stinky smell engulfed the world. And people could no longer breathe. If the earth, itself, not alive could not take it and suffered from a hole within its atmosphere, it is no surprise that we humans are unable to.    Amina:  you do realize why there is a hole in the atmosphere. It is because the politicians know that everyone hates them and so they have planned an escape route in case, at some point, a fanatic tries to kill them. So the truth of the matter is the hole is just a way for the government, once again to trick us all and escape with all our mulla. Our doe. Our money. Show me the money. What are you talking about honey for?    Mariam:  You know, I heard that theory but rejected it. The truth is: there is no hole. I don’t see a hole in the sky. Do you see a hole in the sky?! No. Name me one person who has actually seen it? For all we know, people can be getting cancer because of the food or some governmental created project with us humans as the rodents- testers. You know, I realized that I did not comment on chicken licken. An unusal name, to be sure. Yet, hardly surprising. Her mom was a chicken rib, and her father was an absolute chicken drum.     Amina:  I have neither seen a hole in the sky nor the whole of the sky to know whether there is a hole in the sky. However, I have been assured that there is indeed a hole in the sky.  ________________________________________________________________________  and so you can see why we wished to show you the important matters we discuss. Seriously though, what’s up with name Winnie the Pooh. I mean instead of the characters calling him Winnie, they go like “Pooh….Pooh bear.” What kind of a sick joke is it to name a beloved character to kids after the number 2 we do in the bathroom? And then, I can’t believe it when I hear one of the characters going like “Pooh, where are you?” I’ll tell you where pooh is. Pooh is in the bathroom where it is supposed to be. Honestly, I can not for the life of me, figure out what was wrong with the directors of that cartoon.  _____________________________________________________________________________   Amina Banawan Amina Banawan, amina Banawan,  Amina Banawan, Banawan Amina  Mariam Banawan Mariam Banawan, mariam Banawan,  Maraiam Banawan, Banawan Mariam  If this website does not appear when I write “Amina or Mariam Banawan” in the google search, I am going to explode. I mean every time I search myself, I never come up with amazing moi: people don’t know that I am alive.  It’s like google doesn’t recognize my name….or just doesn’t want to.   I have decided that I am going to copy our names like twenty times on this blog just to make sure the website does appear. I want people to know that I exist. I want a person to type in my name on the net, not really thinking about it, and then discover accidentally that we do indeed have a site. So…….  Amina and Mariam Banawan.  Mariam and Amina Banawan.  Ms. Mariam Banawan   Ms. Amina Banawan A&M Banawan M&A Banawan   Mariamina Banawan.  Amina & Mariam Banawan Mariam & Amina Banawan   Isn’t it ironical? Ashley and Mary Kate’s names also start with A & M. Once I told my friend that the reason why our parents picked out our names with these letters was because they wanted to match Ashley and Mary Kate. It was so funny because she actually believed me…well, why not? I am a convincing actress…right    Back to the task at hand: Amina and Mariam Banawan. Mariam and Amina Banawan. Amina and Mariam Banawan have a website, and if google wants to not include them, well then, that’s google’s problem. Mariam and Amina will go check out yahoo’s search engine.  And that is to be taken as a threat, google. We are deadly serious about this. We’ll see if yahoo can find us or not.   Well it’s time to go…. But remember:   WE will Be back!!  ........................  And we are back!! Yesterday, on my first real day of summer, my parents plunged us back to the dark ages. Quietly, they disconnected the television from the satellite to broaden our interests!! To use our summer wisely?! Thankfully, all has been restored in our house after a little revolution- some people were taught lessons. JUST KIDDING!! I just woke up and found it back on. Only we’re only allowed an hour on it, but not to worry. Each one of us will choose a different hour and therefore gain an hour! The smarties that we are. =)  Talking about television: didja you guyz hear about Tarzan being banned? Didja hear about the reasons: They are so melodramatic. •	The fact that Tarzan had to help/ save Jane. The feminist movement said that this made girls believe that they are unable to protect themselves and need the help of males. They argued the movie had a brainwashing effect and promoted sexism in society.  •	Police all over the country said they are fed up of movies drawing their “evil” characters, ugly and big. They reason that criminals have no general appearance and children should be aware of this. After all, they think movies should teach children to expect the unexpected and know that even their teacher could be a criminal. •	Orphanages were outraged when a five year old ran away. When found and questioned on his reason, the boy said he wanted a home. He distinctly commented on the fact that Tarzan had been embraced by animals and had had a home with them. If living in the jungle was all he needed to do to get a home, well, he could certainly do that.  •	Foster homes were appalled at Kojak’s character- they fear children will be afraid to go to foster homes because they might feel that they will not be accepted by both parents.  •	Religious leaders are worried that the movie subtly promotes the message that the theory of evolution is correct and that humans did evolve from monkeys. •	The Environmental Organization found the appearance of the jaguar as a bad guy, would help encourage people to shoot these lovable creatures. They are concerned that children will grow up, believing that these animals are horrible predators and would thus do nothing to help protect them and save them from extinction. •	Physiatrists thought that the movie further increased peer pressure in children’s minds. “Young Tarzan had to prove to those other monkeys that he was worthy of their friendship. He succumbed to peer pressure and dived from a waterfall. We think this behavior teaches kids to do whatever they can to be accepted by a gang. We find it rather disturbing,” the physiatrists said.  •	The “LAS” (Love All Society) said it did not like how the characters in the play seemed to promote specieism. They said “It’s enough we have racism. Certain characters in that play promote specieism. They acted like humans and animals could not get along because of their differences. We would appreciate it if the characters were censored.” •	A Woman’s Right’s Movement Organization said they did not like how Jane took off most of her clothes at the end of the movie and only wore what appeared to be a bra, and a tiny version of a mini-skirt. They claimed that the way women are pictured in movies are horrible: but one would expect better from a children’s movie. Women did not have to look like models and dress this way: they had much more dignity than that. They think the movie’s underlying message is that nudity should be acceptable in our society.    If you guys did hear that the movie was banned, well then, you heard wrong. It wasn’t banned. We just made up all of those reasons.  (Losers, you actually believed us. Stop shaking your head. You did! I know you did!! Hehe)  ___________________________________________-

      This blog is dedicated in loving memory to Salma's brain which has just recently been lost. Please, it is urgent, if somebody finds it contact us. There's a hefty reward!!   seriously: thanks salma for actually inspiring us to inspire the world.   Hello0o0o0 world.   It’s us. We really do exist.   The crazy_twinz.  How does one go  about and start their first blog? Hmm…I think that we should introduce ourselves.  We’re the Banawan twins and well, we’re often mistakenly called crazy. The truth is, we’re not crazy, but rather, gifted. And so we have decided to share with the world all of our “gifted” thoughts.   It’s actually kinda funny. Almost everyone at one point or another ends up calling us crazy, and a lot of people ask, “how can you talk to each other all day?” because, well we do talk to each other the whole day…and we do that because, we have weird thoughts the entire day that need to be discussed, analyzed, and made fun of .  So, here you go: we’re opening a window into our lives; letting you take a glimpse of all that we do. “we have a world of our own. We’ll tell you things that no one else knows.” we’ll make you go crazy, but at the end of this, you’ll love us :D :D :D  so you get to read former chats we had with some people, notes we pass to each other during class, and things we think up of.   Disclaimer: anything that you read, you read at your own jeopardy.  Warning: if after reading the blogs you find yourself have insane or strange thoughts, and seeking the assistance of a physciatrist, we shall not take any blame.     Thought number one: What is with the name Atomic kitten? Why is it necessary to add such an explosive word such as atomic to a friendly word such as kitten? I mean you might as well call yourself “Raging Butterfly; Bitter Daisy, Furious Bride.” It’s like these days it’s not acceptable to be nice and sweet: you have to have anger with the world to make it. You gotta be a “ Fiendish Angel.”   But I don’t want you guys to think that a kitten is actually cute. No, just because I called the word kitten in the beginning friendly doesn’t mean that they really are. The word kitten connate images of friendly little fluffy creatures; but in reality a kitten is a dangerous miniature tiger. It is a deadly creature with fangs, claws and what one could call a progressing roar.  Kittens are not innocent creatures: they act all cuddly but right when you pick them up, they scratch you. You try to get them off, but you can’t. You run around the room screaming for someone to help you but instead, you find everyone else running away, shrieking and you think, “helloo0o I’m the one with the insane kitten clinging to me.” And you try to throw it off and hurt it, but then you realize that kittens always land on four feet and so there is no point in even trying to help it commit suicide by putting it on the balcony.  And so you give up to the fact that you do indeed have what one could call “an atomic kitten.”  Thus, I have arrived at the conclusion that the reason one tends to call oneself such outrageous names is because one realizes that nothing in one hundred percent angelic, nor sweet. There has to be a hidden tiger somewhere or other inside of them.   But you, know, I ‘m getting ahead of myself. I should start at the beginning. You know, I’ll start by giving you an autobiography. There are two of us- obviously since we’re twinz. Actually, up until this year we were the only twins in my family. We were special in that way. But then, my uncle got married and had twins. Almost exactly 16 years later. It’s funny…my cousins have not only taken what was special about me, but managed to do it right almost my birthday so that there is nothing really special.   Why did you say: It’s funny. I don’t see what’s so funny about it!   Speaking of having young cousins: I hate it. It’s just like what one of my best friends said: when you go and visit your relatives, they dump you with a two year old and say “go play.” What the heck go and play? I’m 16 years old not a toddler. What they really mean is go babysit the kids, make sure they don’t cry, clean their crap after them, and have fun in the process of doing what I don’t want to do: have fun taking care of the kids that I don’t want to take care of… the ones I dumped you with and make sure to burp them, and …..the list doesn’t finish.   I have just changed my mind. It would be utterly impossible for me to write an autobiography now. Too many stories, or anecdotes. Too many characters and no plot.  You know, its summer here. The first real day of summer, but it feels like the weekend. Those two days that one always waits for in the beginning of the week, which in our case is Saturday. (That means our weekend is Thursday and Friday)   From about two weeks, the yearbooks have been making their rounds. Time to write messages. It suprises me how vain people are, myself included. Everybody wants their yearbook to be filled with messages on how great of a friend and person they are. Somebody you just said hi to once, becomes another person who just must  write in your book. Your yearbook wouldn’t be complete without their inspirational writing. So your book gets filled with bull and you can go home and read all those messages and marvel how you’ve affected so many people. There will be a couple messages with your name spelled wrong, but you won’t let that bother you. Things that you have no recollection of doing  at all or saying, but because their message will include something about your “sweet, beautiful nature”, you’ll accept it readily enough.   Almost all my messages had the same meaning: You’ve been such a great friend. You’re so sweet and I can always rely on you. Good luck on your exams. Have a great summer. And I’ll miss you. How pathetic!! But then there are the true friends: and one doesn’t know or just can’t put to words how one feels. Because our heart has not a mouth for itself, and so our feelings can not be translated into words and put on paper.  Enough of the philosophy you’re killing me!! By da way, some of you guyz didn’t sign my year book yet. It’s kinda empty. I wrote in yours!     I hope you are all reading this in a British accent: not that I have one. Hahaha. I just want you guys to sound like dorks. Not that the British accents are dorky: it’s just that people always sound like dorks when they try to make an accent. Haha!!  You know when we were trying to make up a name for our blog, our sis, offered “fairy dust”. Such a cute name. And there’s star dust too. There’s all these sweet, girlish dust names. But I’ve never seen dust like that; all I’ve seen is JUST DUST! Little unwanted, black particles filling up the air causing diseases...  I ,now, know the true mark of a pessimist. Here’s the true test: Tell the person in question “You’re a pessimist.” In almost every case, the pessimist will say, “I’m not a pessimist. I’m a realist.” And that’s how you know. As for us, we’re not pessimists…we’re just realists.   I’ve always thought it is stupid to be an optimist. I don’t see the point. Once, you have all these expectations and hopes you can only go down. Whereas, if you expect the worst thing in the world and imagine it 10x worse, then you can only go up. And feel better. It might be cowardly, but hey…its going to save me a lot of money at the shrinks.   So what was I saying again? Oh yeah, we’re Mariamina. Not Mama Mia, Mariamina. See, my name is Mariam. And my name is Amina. But if you write Mariam and then add ina, you have both our names. Mariamina. That’s us!! Or you could just write half of mariam’s name: which would be mari, and then add all of amina’s name: so you would get Mariamina. My parents are clever wits aren’t they. Not! They didn’t figure it out. We found it out by an accident: like all true discoveries that help humankind, we discovered an interesting way to combine those two precious names “amina and mariam”.   Goodbye peoples. Take care, and remember to reach for the moon because even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars. Remember, always dream and hope …

      First of all, just wanted to make a very important introduction as hostess. Blog, the person eyeing you and reading every letter typed on you does indeed have a history with me. It’s my friend Sara A. Sara A, this is THE BLOG! Never, insult it by called the blog. It must always be capitalized. Hehe. Now, that I know there is a reader reading my inspirational and exceptional writing…that I am making a difference however slight it is in somebody’s day and thinking…it is now that I feel that I have begun to accomplish what I set out to do as a child. What I dreamed about. I can laugh my as* off that somebody actually reads this cra*.   (Yes, I have decided that I will not become corrupted. My mouth will remain clean like a newborn babe. I will speak no falsehood nor utter what I do not know as fact. I will speak as an intellectual, knowing that I am an example to countless others…yeah, right!!)  I’m typing this in my sister’s room, even though it’s light is very dim. It casts shadows in the room that play tricks with my eyes fooling them; like mirages. Me- I like my light to be brilliant, to radiate, to spread everywhere ‘till all sense of blackness has disappeared. To feel enveloped in this light that shines. Till it is beyond impossible to realize that it is night that I am writing this in.   Okay, now I’m in a different room. Literally. We moved back to our room.  You know I was talking to my friend today, after I realized a very embarrassing thing. I brought my mobile with me for like no reason. I mean not one phone call. Not one missed call. Nothing! Whereas my friends kept having to get out of the pool, run, and grab their mobile how many times. Really, its humiliating. I brought a phone with me for people to call me- the fact that nobody did means it was absolutely useless. I mean somebody wouldn’t even have realized I had a mobile if I hadn’t told them. Yeah, I can see it now.  “Hey! I’m so down on credit. Could I borrow somebody’s phone. Please…pplz keep calling me”. Everybody looks around, but nobody wants to part with this treasure. It’s beyond valuable; its vital for their existence. There isn’t enough of it already. Only I scream out “Sure, you can borrow mine. I’ve got lots of credit.” Wait a second. All heads turn around and find me. Everybody stares in disbelief and then everybody’s mouth forms the same question: You have a mobile?! But we never heard it ring.  And then, because I’m so embarrassed I’ll smile meekly and say, “You could borrow mine if I had one.” Everybody will laugh and say, “Okay… you actually had us for a second!”  And now to our second chat that is more an insult trade.   Amina: You know, there are all kinds of idiots. Like your teacher is an idiot because he assigned you homework on a lesson that you didn’t even complete. Your dad is an idiot because he can’t understand that what you’re wearing is style. The guy who takes your order and gives you back your food at a fast food place is an idiot because he brought you the wrong food.  Sara A is an idiot because well, she is.  Mariam: Ahhh! Such an expert on idiots. I presume this comes from first hand experience: analyzing and dealing with yourself, my lovely butthead. I would like you to know that I’ve had a deliciously nice time today at a swimming bonanza at my pal’s. Surely, I did. Actually, we stayed in the pool for such a long time that my skin became as soft as a child’s, but as wrinkled as an old lady’s. Chlorine intertwined and shrouded my hair. I even got the markings of the beginning of a tan. The bronze color that I do love. You know, my chere, today I saw the strength of character somebody could have, but more importantly I discovered something. Do you know what it is?  Amina: I think my buttercup (notice, the usage of the word butt in that delightful flower) that I do know what you mean. You discovered how to use makeup. Was my deduction correct? Otherwise, how the heck can you claim that your skin was turning the color of bronze? Or maybe you discovered true imagination. Was that one correct? You know, my dumpling, I don’t believe that our guests (those people who don’t bother to write comments but read what we wrote) don’t know that we actually made up a game, several years ago, that had the same idea as the “Powerpuff girls.” And to think that we could have been famous if we had sold our idea long ago…:(   Mariam: Ahhh! (Notice how my paragraphs always start like that) I see, that you have not discovered what it is. However, once a wise woman said “Knowledge comes not from within but from what diffuses from the journey of life”, I can not share this information with you. In case, you didn’t guess who was the eloquent owner of this saying it is your butercup. (That my dearie, is the proper way to spell it when talking to moi). About our lovely game, please don’t insult it and me. You know it was 100x better than the Powerpuff gurls: HeLlOoO it starred me!! It’s okay: to err is human; to forgive divine. Second of all, my plays and my genius are a gift and work of art. I can not even attempt to picture estimating and labeling a price for them. Cold, dead presidents (money) is not something that I (I wanted to make that capitalized, but it already is) will sell my soul to; no matter how tempting it can be.  Amina: Of course you won’t sell your soul: my dear teezacup (teeza is butt in Arabic :D) I wouldn’t want you to do that. I didn’t ask you to sell your soul. I couldn’t ask you to do that. Okay, enough of the bull. Are you sure that there is no way I can’t convince you to do it? To sell your soul? To get rid of it? Please, it’s for humanity. It’s for the better cause. It’s for the good of Rome. Hhahahha Caesar has fried my brain. Or should that be Brutus and Cassius have fried my brain, since Caesar was dead. Nope, wrong again. Shakespeare has fried my brain. Oh wait, that’s still wrong. Of course they didn’t fry my brain. You see my brain is, just, well a miracle. It’s so big and full of knowledge. Enough modesty: time to brag. My brain is huge. It’s loaded. It’s awesome, and the whole world wants it because they all know that I have the biggest weapon when it comes to mass destruction. I’ve got my calculating, intelligent, cunning, amazing, and mind boggling brain. Get it? Mind boggling?! Hahahahaha  Mariam: Zakhroota at the amount of bul* you are able to make up in very few seconds; at the most imaginative lies one could write. But I shan’t give your tiny brain, another moment of my precious time. I have more important matters to discus: a toe that has a freckle, the freckle is brown…does this mean that the toe must have a brown spot? Confusing right. Allow me to make it easier; it’s the pinky toe; the one the little piglet got stuck, crying, and couldn’t find his way home. That’s the toe.  Amina: you must be quite familiar with the little piggys. How do you spell the plural of piggys? I don’t want pigs, I want piggys. It keeps marking it wrong. Oh well. Anyways, I was incorrect in writing that you are quite familiar with little piggys. I should have written that you are familiar with all piggys. And don’t you dare call me a piggy, I know the way your sick brain works, Mariam.  Mariam: It shames me to dishonour my beautiful, honorable, held high, name by allowing you to write your name next to mine. (To pplz who are having difficulty keeping up with our influential corespondance, I urge you to get a translator to translate our exceptional, genius language into your idiocy. People of your slow capabilities can’t do this by yourself)  Amina: you know what would be really sad, (you’re right. Your name shouldn’t be anywhere near mine, but for the opposite reason) if our soul mates somehow read this blog and find out that we are insane. Years later we catch up with them; they are exactly as we would want them to be, and we agree to get married, until they realize that we are the proud owners of this blog. Then they run like heaven (why is it hell?!) away from us, and we never get to marry our soul mates. All because of this blog.   It’s too much. We can not continue. I urge you Mariam to take into consideration your future and leave this blog to be.   Mariam: Oh, Amina. The minute my future husband (insha Allah) discovers you are my sister, I am a goner. (Don’t even think about saying it’s because he’d fall in love with you). I don’t blame him; I only put up with you because you’re family…there is no reason he should have to put himself in such a horrible situation. And I have a clue why its h-e- double hockey sticks/heaven. (but I won’t tell you…like a wise person once said “Knowledge is the waterwheel that soaks up information, turns it around, and absorbs all that is logical and correct.”  THE END OF OUR CHAT FOR NOW. (in case you didn’t know, mariam ended it…which means she won!!)   Amina: “ Bullshit, is what the bull excels at. Shit is what Mariam excels at.” Hey, guess what? That’s my quote :D :D :D :D   * we’re going now, just wanted to tell Sara A. we love you :D :D

      What does it mean to do embarrassing things? To an English teacher it’s making a grammar mistake and having the students correcting it. To a math teacher it’s doing a simple mathematical calculation wrong. To a thief it’s entering the wrong house and getting caught. To me: it’s basically my life.    I don’t think a day goes by without something embarrassing happening. Sometimes, I’ll admit I get embarrassed at things that are beyond my control: things that aren’t even my fault. Like when actors act out an embarrassing scene on t.v. When someone says something not realizing that who they’re talking about is right behind them. Sometimes I get embarrassed to tell the waitress that she actually picked up my fork when she picked up the plate, and so I don’t have a fork anymore.   Getting embarrassed when you find out that your big sister actually did something that seems more like a scene from a movie, only she did it live, is pretty normal -when she tells you how she picked up the microphone at this place, not realizing it was actually on, and was singing in front of everyone “Right here waiting for you.” It’s okay to get embarrassed for her and envious. It’s okay to be proud that the people said she had a good voice.   Getting embarrassed that you embarrassed your teacher is okay too. Like when my teacher was saying how he never learned things fast, but once he learned them, he never let them go. And to prove this, he started to name Jupiter’s moons, only he added Titan, and so you raised your hand up in front of the class, and corrected him, telling him Titan is actually Saturn’s moon. Of course, he agreed with you right away and corrected himself, but it’s okay to be embarrassed that you put him in that position and that your class was staring at you as if you had just grown another nose. Well, why not? You just proved to them, for the umpteenth time, what a geek you were. (Notice: Please notice the verb: were. Were is the past tense. It means it happened in the past; I was a geek in the past.  Right? Right?! This is so embarrassing: why isn’t anyone agreeing with me?!)  Getting embarrassed is annoying. People say, why are you embarrassed? There’s nothing to be embarrassed about, but of course there’s always something to be embarrassed about…especially in my life…  But you know, the good thing is, I’m over being embarrassed about my last name. It’s not that I was really embarrassed. It’s just that, everyone always had to make a big deal about. “Banawan,” that’s quite an unusual last name.. “Banawan? That’s your last name? Where are you originally from?” Like who the heck cares where I’m from. What are you going to go talk to my great ancestors about my last name? PleaZZZZe—get a life!     	 Actually once, I told my friend that we were actually Chinese. I then pronounced my name, in such a way, that she believed me I said, “ Bana –wAn”. It was really funny. It turned out anyways, that I had relatives living in the Philippines…to all you Banawans out there, that I don’t know, I love you guys :D   Anyways, I couldn’t really be embarrassed. There was a t.v. show practically dedicated to our last name. It was called “Camp Banawana.” I swear, there was a t.v. show called that. The only problem is no one seems to have heard of it, or seen an episode of it. That’s my homework assignment for you guys. Go look it up….believe me, it exists! And I used to like it too…well why not? It practically had my last name.    You know back to the topic of embarrassment: when you realize that all this time you’ve been singing on the bus, thinking that the girl behind you doesn’t really talk, and she won’t mind, then seeing her SINGING on the graduation, is a time for embarrassment. But, anyways that girl left the school, so phew, things are okay. No one’s going to find out the truth about our voices.  Speaking of which, my math teacher makes fun of my voice. It’s because I have a low voice (not very girly) and because I have an American accent. He seems to find it very funny, but at the same time irritating. Anyways, I’m always making fun of him/and he makes fun of me, so that’s okay. Only I have this dream: I want to work for a news station. Read the news everyday, in that fake voice they have. (I tried it with my friend once and she said I did have the right voice.) Be all smiley everyday, reading the news. Then one day, for just one second, I’ll say, “And my voice is now famous…take that mr. former math teacher.” And then I’ll just continue on reading the news as if I hadn’t said anything weird.   You know, I once saw this woman on the news station go like “I forgot all my lines. Sorry,”! It was actually quite humorous: and now that I think about it, quite embarrassing.  I wonder if she ever had a teacher that made fun of her voice….  I have dreams of going back to all those bullies that used to bully, young, quite me…Is that normal? Hehe, having dreams where you go and take revenge against a kid that teased you/ bullied you when you were in kindergarten? Well, who cares if it’s normal…., let me let you in on a little secret: I’m not aiming for normalcy, you see :O Yup, my life is gonna be different. Not that it hasn’t been already, but well…  Anyways, I see my twinster has been discussing bad habits. Let me tell you what  a really really annoying habit is. When someone goes on and on about nothing. Keeps on talking and talking and you just want them to shut up. You feel like saying, “ Hey, I don’t need to catch a train. I actually need to stand in front of a train so I can die…It would be less painful than listening to you go on and on.” Or you just want to tell the person that you have discovered they have exactly 34 freckles on their face, seventeen eyelashes on one side, a thicker eye-brow on the other, and that they are in desperate need of plastic surgery. You realized that because well, why they were so nicely discussing what their mother told them when they were 6 years old, you happened to have time to glance at their face. (Of course, you don’t actually tell them this, or that fact that you were staring at their face, dreaming of ways to kill them and that you figured out 4 so far.) Nope, you just sit down, and listen to them talk and talk. I hate those people.   Anyways, I figure I talked a bit. Not enough for you? What you say you want more of my wisdom? Sorry you’ll have to wait until next time!  Byebyez!

      An unusual thought: in old English, ass meant donkey…when was it coined to mean butt? And why? What is the connection? That’s your homework, peoples. Put some effort and research it. After all, you’re not always going to have answers just fall into your lap.    You know it’s impossible to see beyond what you see. Cuz if you see something and look beyond it, well then you see what is beyond it…so you’re still looking, if you know what I mean?  Which remind me: you know what I mean? What a stupid expression. How do I know if you know what I mean? You could very well say, you know, I know what you mean. And it would just go on…that expression is just because people are too lazy to continue on with their explanations and stuff. So to just end it, like their conclusion sentence, they just stick that in.   That also reminds me…seems I’m like a grandmother; so many memories. Anyways, when I was a kid, we had to write vocabulary paragraphs and other delightfully fun, not, paragraphs. Well, I enjoyed writing so I’d start writing. Everything would be so detailed…I’d have written so much but still be at the beginning. Nowhere near where I wanted to end, so I’d just add this, “Well, I got to go now. My hand hurts”. Can you believe it? How stupid? How shameful? I could go on and on, but the truth is I’m kinda tired of typing all this time… so gotta go. oOops, looks like I still have that habit.  Some habits just don’t die, now do they? Well, maybe because they’re called habits…duh! If it’s a habit, then it’s something you’ve been doing for a long time, and if you’ve been doing it for a long time, then you’re used to it. And if you’re used to it, then its part of your nature. And if it’s part of your nature, then it’s hard to stop it. So you just keep on doing it, and that’s why it doesn’t die.  But you know habits also change. When I was a kid, I didn’t mind staring into mirrors. Now I do. In fact, I don’t just mind. I hate it! I loathe it! I abhor it! Just trying to sketch you a picture (instead of paint you a picture). You know why I hate it? Cuz I just see my  reflection. If you’re a smart aleck, then you’re saying right now “Really, what did you expect to see? The zoo?!” No I did not expect to see the zoo. I expected to see my soul. Yes, that means I’m pretty happy with who I am. In fact, if you were to look at it, it means I think that I am a beautiful person inside and am quite surprised that it doesn’t show on the outside. Now, over here…I’m being arrogant yet modest, aren’t I? Arrogant since I’m calling my soul beautiful, but modest since I’m saying I’m ugly. But you have no way of knowing if this is true…so it doesn’t matter to you. It matters to me though…mirrors and pictures can only capture your outwardly appearance. They’re so shallow. And that is why they can not picture who you are.   You know it’s funny how people seem to think because they know celebrities, then the celebrities must know them. We memorize their birthdays, their favorite expressions… everything about them. The whole time, though, these celebrities have no idea that we exist. That we actually walk the same earth that they do. We’re just not there, to them. Who can blame them? It’s not like our birthdays or anything about us, is published or taped so that they could be aware of our existence. It’s not like our own best friends remember our birthday anyway. When we see them, or get them to sign our autographs…when we wave at them, we feel like we’re with a friend, whereas all they see is some people obsessed with them. Yup, fans!   Fans: its such a weird word. It can mean an appliance that helps keep you cool or some admirer. I see no connection what’s so ever. English really is strange.  You know, I used to get so angry whenever I heard some British word, like mum. Until, this year when I realized that it was Americans who copied the British, took their language…and then changed it. (or else they just didn’t copy it right)   But the word loo still annoys me. Just say it; loo. Hey, people who are called Leau or have that as a name are really unlucky.    Silent, like a ghost it creeps. With the stealth of a thief, and the confidence of a natural predator it sneaks behind the unsuspecting bird. Its eyes focus on its victim: the bull eye. For a second, just a second, the bird smells something. Something dangerous in the air; something ugly. It looks with its beady eyes all around, but it can’t spot anything. But the feeling of something wrong, still lingers.  It finds itself in a dilemma. Does it leave its breakfast or stay? This bird has not eaten for a long time and…it didn’t find anything risky. Maybe though, that’s why there were no other birds there. Maybe, it wasn’t lucky and that’s why it found food, but because it was unlucky. Go or stay? Stay or go? It can not choose. But the choice is made for it. And a single white feather falls to the ground.

      Amina: The hippopotamuses have come in gigantic herds to the great ear to hear. Yes, the herds have come to be heard.  Mariam: The ear stood under the black hair, slightly to the right of the monstrous nose, southwest of the beady eye, waiting for these herds that came to hear. It was an ear marked with superiority; canals that run through, and a tiny hole in the center of its lobe which was the hook of the earring.  Amina: Nah, the hippopotamuses did not go that superior ear, but rather to the ear on the opposite side. The left ear.   Mariam: Oops my daisies. I had quite forgotten that the hippopotamuses were exiled and disowned by the superior ear. You know, the scandal is hardly talked of. Even less the bumble bee that was a honeyetarian. Scandalous, I do say.    Amina: Oh no, my little chap. The bee was not a honeytarian. I think you meant that it was anti-honey. That little trumble bee refused to eat any of the glorious honey. I remember it clearly. They said, the bee said, “ I ai’nt sweet and I don’t want to eat something sweet.” Still that was nothing compared to the dandelion petals. Remember them? They refused to fly away. Said, “home sweet home, we’re never leaving you.” And they stayed. Dandelion petals aren’t supposed to do that: they’re supposed to be brave you know. Them being called dande-LIONS. They’re supposed to fly far away from home, but these… were….err….humph. It was just so scandalous I can’t talk about it.   Mariam: But don’t forget the story of little bear. Legend has it, that in ancient times a baby bear was born on the first night of spring. As he grew older and older, his mother began to teach him how to hunt salmon. But a curious and unusual thing happened, the little bear could never catch one. Almost as if the pond was deserted and contained nothing even if it was overfilling with salmon. Each day his mother would have hope and would send him off with some tips, but each day he would come home empty handed. His mother, desperate to help him, asked an old berumim- old, wise bear. She went to the ultimate bERuMim, known only as FATHER bear and asked him to help her son. FATHER Bear told her, he’d seen this little bear and the truth was this little bear had woven tiny leaves into a coat. so you can see this little bear, was not bare at all! And that’s why…because he did not follow the law of the jungle (as Rudyard kipling would say) he was cursed to live on an empty bare stomach. Shameful I say. I can’t really speak of it.   Amina: Oh, that was absolutely scandalous. Really, there are some things I know, I can’t speak about them either. Horrible, horrible. Let me tell you, the story of the butterfly. Oh, what? You know it already. Yes, yes, I understand. I won’t bother the time to say it. Let me just tell them a bit. The butterfly was once a fly who could not fly. He was a walk so to say (because he couldn’t fly.) One day, his mother, the poor old mamfly said, “Son, we have tried everything we can to make you fly. Let’s just put some butter on you, and maybe you’ll get slippery.” The little fly agreed and followed his mamfly’s order. But when he put the butter on himself, he found that all the petals of the wind stuck to him and so he became beautiful. The shameful thing, now extraordinary, left his mother and flew off. Never talked to her again when he became pretty. Really, it’s absolutely shocking I can’t talk about it.   Mariam: Oh no! That’s not the story at all. No way. Now you know, I don’t like to talk about these things, you know I don’t. You know, I never talk. I don’t. I’m closed book when it comes to these things: but really, just to educate you: the story is, his father being a cheap man (as you know all men are) used Tut Tue Tut butter. That awful kind! And so when he wore the butter all the village butterflys made fun of him. Well the truth it, it became so hard for him that he just killed himself. That’s the true story. I swear! But you know the juiciest, I mean most disgraceful story of all is Tweety’s…but well that I just can’t open my mouth about it in public.   *Meet you at my house for some tea.   Amina: Oh dear, your story is completely wrong. Let me tell you the right version.  The butterfly was once a fly who could not fly. He was a walk so to say (because he couldn’t fly.) One day, his mother, the poor old mamfly said, “Son, we have tried everything we can to make you fly. Let’s just put some butter on you, and maybe you’ll get slippery.” The little fly agreed and followed his mamfly’s order. But when he put the butter on himself, he found that all the petals of the wind stuck to him and so he became beautiful. The shameful thing, now extraordinary, left his mother and flew off. Never talked to her again when he became pretty. Really, it’s absolutely shocking I can’t talk about it. (now whose the idiot who actually re-read it? I said the correct story in the beginning, duh!)  Okay time to leave so that I can go visit mariam.   posted!

      OMG! Brainstorm. Thunderstorm. Lightning flashing around and bouncing off my skull. My brain is now afloat because of the storm. Hehe, I had another idea. You know after somebody breaks up, this person’s friends usually end up saying sometime when they are trying to comfort him/ her: there are other fish at sea.  Excuse me, but that is about the stupidest expression one can say at a time like this! Do you want the person to just jump right out the window?  What one is ultimately saying is that the world is full of people: hundreds, thousands, millions, and billions of people. The chances of finding the perfect match, your soul mate, your dream man/ woman are statistically impossible. But hey, maybe you’re lucky…after all some people actually do win the lottery. Well, now to find the person who captures your heart who fills it up with joy and then to have him/ her toss back into your face and spit it out- well that can be a problem. Now this hurt person has already experienced this/ at least feels like he/she has, and you are asking them- no telling them to go experience it again?! Are you CRAZY?!!! There are also sharks in the sea, aren’t there?!! They’ve already gotten their heart amputated, what more do you want?   Hey, hey; then there’s the other saying: I’ve got bigger fish to fry. And another other: Something fishy is going on. What the heck is the big deal about fish. Fish this and fish that. Ewwwwwwwww!! Istaghfir Allah, but I don’t like fish.  WAIT A SECOND… do sharks live in seas? Whatever, that’s besides the point…you got what I was talking about. Actually, what I was writing since I’m not actually talking. Wait another second: not what I’m writing…what I’m typing.   But let’s talk about handwriting. I’m sorry you guys. I’m truly sorry that you can not see our beautiful handwriting and that instead, you’re stuck with this computer font. I mean, notice the word font. It’s got nothing pretty about it. But handwriting: the word handwriting: it’s like a flowing art…h~a~n~d~w~r~i~t~i~n~g. It’s so beautiful. Of course, not everyone can pull it off. In fact, you guys just stop lying to yourselves. I want you guys to be truthful to yourselves. That way I can be truthful with you. Okay, I guess we’re not ready for the full blown out truth: I’ll just say it mildly. Your handwriting sucks. I mean are you sure it’s your hand that wrote that, and not another part of your anatomy? Seriously, do you need handwriting classes or what? Sheshesheshe (our feminine version of heheheh. Yeah, GirL PoWeR all thE WaY!) We don’t have handwriting: we have calligraphy. It’s part of our blood.   Speaking of girl power: did we ever tell you guys that we have a part time job as ballerinas? We didn’t? Well of course we didn’t, because if we did then we would have been lying. Ha! Sadly we do not have part time jobs as ballerinas.   You know I had this really cool idea but I forgot it. Out it went- and flew into the sky, leaving me alone. All alone with the distant memory of having thought up of something remarkable that is soOoO ANNOYING!! Oh well. Bye (So abrupt yet so refreshing)

      Amina: Can you imagine missing out on a whole season? Waking up one morning and finding out that you have missed out the whole of winter. How would it feel? I think it would be strange. But you know bears do it all the time. Just lie down and go to sleep for months. One morning it’s winter time, and the next, it is spring.  Mariam: You know, that would be very freaky. It’s funny how fast time seems to travel. It’s scary to think that the second time passes by it is gone forever…irretrievable. It is beyond impossible to ever bring back a moment. Thankfully, my friend, I am not a bear. I am more like a hyena. At least my laugh is, as my good friend pointed out.   Amina: Yes, indeed. A second is irretrievable. For those reading this blog,(unlike Salma) how many minutes have they lost? And yet, how much have they gained? A different perspective, a new thought to munch on, and a whole lot smarter, wouldn’t you agree? I say, you do resemble a hyena, slightly.   Mariam: Ahhh! Ideas…they flow in my head. Some are born slowly…gradually they begin to form into a clearer shape, until they mature  and are completely developed. From intangible to tangible they become. Others race around in my head as quickly as lightening flashing in a dark storm, lost forever. Still, others die before they are even born. Miscarried in my head. Wait a second…if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you twice. I do not like the word miscarried. Excuse me?! Miscarriage sounds like it’s the woman’s fault…like she didn’t carry the baby properly. I do not, do not like that word. That word, That word, I do not like. Does that remind you of somebody?  Amina: Do I remember that? That do I remember? Quite frankly, YES… I do remember. That style of writing was that of the famous Dr. Seuss. Well, my ideas are like the things in the ocean. That is to say, some are coral reefs; all entangled up, and of various shapes, sizes, colors. Others are like tiny fishies swimming around. And even others are like the treasure chests buried deep within the ocean. I know that they are there, yet, I can’t seem to remember where they are. I can’t seem to open the treasure chest, until at last, when I least expect it, I remember and the chest is opened to reveal the hidden, glorious treasure: perhaps it is a fond memory, a creative idea (that at first I can not seem to form), or maybe it’s just a thought that will make me smile when things aren’t that great.   Mariam: How very amusing. But I must beg to differ. Unlike your ideas, the ocean is deep…rich. It is wide and almost infinite in a sense. Your ideas are shallow. Cliché. I will allow you to say that you do have some good ideas but they are like a warm current that passes only in summer. Although it has the possibility of having a monumental effect, it doesn’t because as quickly as it comes…it disappears.   Amina: well my dumpling (notice the term dump in it) if your ideas are like plants sprouting and maturing you must remember that they are also like them in the sense that they are stomped on, pulled (yours are mostly weeds) and those that actually mature into trees are cut down. Aaah, my friend, we never hear the stories of the trees that have been cut down. Instead, we go and write our own stories on paper which comes from the trees. And so the question remains. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

      Today a most extraordinary thing happened. Before we explicate, let us stop and ponder the absurdity of the word extraordinary. The word is obviously made up of two words: extra, and ordinary. We all know that the word extra means more. If we substitute the word more in the word extraordinary we get: moreordinary. Moreordinary? I mean, what’s up with that? Doesn’t more ordinary sound like the most ordinary instead of beyond ordinary. Maybe, it’s just me…well you know what they say: Geniuses are never satisfied, to criticize and find fault is their habit.  if you say that you do know that saying than you’re really really weird because I just made that up.  Actually once a couple of years ago this weird thing happened.  I swear it’s true. See, I sorta wrote my friend’s homework for her. We had to write short poems and so I kinda wrote one for her and she turned it in. you know what the teacher wrote back? Do not copy poems, and she wrote the title of some poem. I swear! I’m like, errrm, umm, okay so she cheated but she did not COPY a poem. I made it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyways, what happened today was most unusual: quite extraordinary. It was to put it bluntly, something that has led me to believe in the goodness of people again. Ahhh, you’re tired. You want us to just blurt it out. But no, one can never tell a story from the end. And that is why I will have to start at the beginning.   As most of you know: we’ve entered this contest with our sis and her friend. Who ever loses the most weight gets a NICE GIFT. SO, we’ve basically been starving ourselves for the past two days. Well, today we were surfing the Internet and we found out that: THAT’S BAD!! So we started eating again. But then, Salma was fasting. And so we had to eat AGAIN!! That’s why after maghrib we decided to go walking. To lose weight.  So we started out and everything was going fine UNTIL: ahmed started complaining. Thankfully our mom came and picked us up. Then our family decided to go buy ice cream. AND that’s where trouble began.   After we’d finished our ice creams, my mom slammed the car into the raseef/ side walk. The wheel drowned in the sand and to put it frankly: we were stuck! So we called up our daddyo and just stood there, looking like 4 damsels in distress. Now here’s the kewl part.  ALL THESE PEOPLE STOPPED TO HELP US!! I mean loads of people. Cars just kept stopping and looking and trying to figure out how to get the car out. Especially this one determined man. Insha Allah, he’ll go to heaven. WE’ll we were starting to get pretty desperate because nothing was working, but then finally: the car was on the street again!! Yay, alhamidulla.  *Even if any of you read this from Salma’s blog: I know ours is better!! It has to be! Hers is probably to short. I’m sure it is. :D ;D  * riddle: when is a door, not a door?    when it is ajar...hahhaa...hahahha..HEhahEhahesheshe Lol! *start laughing peoples*. i saw this riddle in a movie...called Bartok the Magnificent. yes, yes, it was a cartoon. sue me!  the name is banwan. banwan mariam and amina signing off. (think bond)  PoSted.

      Having a boring day? here's our original list of things to do! have fun...  Go up to a teacher. Compliment him on his shoes and then ask him where he got them from. (When I did this I was talking to a woman teacher. After she told me the name of the store, I said Excellent. But that gives a clue to what you're about to say next) Next, ask to try on their shoes. Observe their face.  IF you're playing a basketball/ any sport game and let's just say things aren't going as good as planned and you want to have some fun : 1) bark like a dog 2) roar like a lion. *part 1, the roaring like a dog was inspired by an episode of "america's funniest home videos..*  Make sure you bring a pack of gum with you the next time you go out with your friends. Hopefully, at least one of your friends will ask for a piece. Take out a notebook and write their name. Check your watch. Write down the time. Look at your friend and say: If I don't get the same kind of gum tomorrow, I'm never going to give you gum again. And I'm not going to be your friend. *credit for this one goes to our best friend. she came up with the idea, and we modified it.*  When you're at a mall go to the kids/ toddlers side. Choose a very small shirt. IF a sales person comes and tries to help you tell him/ her that you lost weight and were wondering if they had a smaller size.   oh here's another school one. when the teacher tells you they want your undivided attention or some cra* like that, stare at them without moving one muscle. STARE with all your heart. open your eyes as wide as you can. push your head forward, and place your hands cupped around your ears (as if you want to see and hear everything) then, as they get up to go on the board follow their every movement...that is, if they are writing something on the board move your head along with them. if they move their hand to touch their face or something, copy their movements.  I haven't tried this one out...maybe later. Go to the public library. Take a very tragic book. Sit down and laugh as hard as you can. Slap your knees. Look around and point to the book with a smile. (Romeo and Juliet is a good one)  Next time you're in a restaurant...go up to a complete stranger and look at them hurt. Say in a whiney voice: You ordered with out me?!  When you enter school, wave...the KING WAVE! SMile a fake smile, and say "Autographs will be given at lunch. A nominal fee of 40 bucks will be required." (You know I kinda did this one. I stood up in our balcony in Egypt and began telling everybody standing outside "My people, bow to me..you have...." everybody thought I was a freak.)  When you get a new teacher this is how to be annoying. whenever they do something on the board, for example a problem in math, raise your hand and say, "that's not the way, our teacher used to do it." etc. it really bugs them. *friend said this one before*  things to when you get a propsal for marriage:  I alaways thought that if a guy proposed to me (and I did love him)I'd look at him and say "OMG! You've confused my intentions by a lot. I don't understand why you want to ruin our friendship. Please go...you've done enough." Of course, I probably won't be able to do that becuase if somebody proposed to me who I really loved I'd probably be crying.   I also thought I'd make him answer about 100 questions that are completely irrelevant. Like "When you brush your teeth, which tooth do you start with?" or "When you eat, do you eat from the left side of the plate or the right side of the plate?" or "Which colors look better together :purple and blue or orange and yellow?" When he's finished and I'm grading his answers I'll flinch and grimace every second. I'll even tear one up and say "I'll pretend I didn't see that one." or I might just start crying and say "Why are you doing this to me? Why?" AT the end, I'll look at him and say you passed. Time for the second level and give him the next batch of 100 questions. of course if he actually really loves me, he'll go through it. HAHA, YEAH RIGHT!  things to do in a cinema:  okay, go to a movie you've already gone to. Sit next to a stranger and tell them what's going to happen the whole time. Especially if its a horror movie. For example: somebody is right about to be killed. You say :Don't worry. He's not actually going to die. Just you wait and see. *this was actually done to a frined*  Also, laugh very loudly when its a tragic movie or pretend to cry when its a comedy. Scream peircing screams when anything remotely scary happens. IF somebody is about to kiss, look at whoever sitting next to you and say: Cover your eyes. It's inappropriate while you take out a magnifying glass.   Answer a mobile/ cell phone. Make sure your voice is very loud as you say : NO! You're not disturbing me. I'm just watching a boring movie. It's really not interesting." Keep talking as loud as you can about nothing.  Make lots of crunching noises as you chew pop corn. Eat it like a pig. Stuff your head inside of the box...if somebody asks what you are doing. Say: It takes too much time to put my hand in the box and then bring it back to my mouth. Or say: I'm hungry, Mama. I'm hungry.  When a bad or evil character says their plan say :Boo!! Get off the stage. act like you take the movie personally and start saying mama jokes.  Keep on criticizing everything in the move: costumes, acting, everything. After a very touching scene, snicker and say: I could do tht in my sleep. What a sucky actress!  *My bro did this one. We were watching Around the World in 80 days with Jackie Chan so he got up and tried to mimick all the karate moves. Very EMBARRASSING but funny!*  don't worry. once we think of more, we'll add them!  From the creators of "Str8 from the Asylum" comes  "a list of crazy things to do."  Now in theatres. (hahaha doesn't it kinda sound real?!)  catch yall l8er!

      Mariam: The oil canvas lay on the desk, unfinished. Just resting for all of eternity…the oil colors sitting next to it. Peeking at it from their tired eyes and trying to relax their aching head. One of them, Mrs. Pink, had an awful headache. Her head ached, just as headaches do, and she felt terrible. But she had escaped Mr. Blue’s fate. His was death, thankfully it was instant. The Fingers, as they were called, had broken his body in half.   Amina: Ah, the Fingers. Those that meant life and death: the stressed one colored too tightly and poof! You were gone. Or the distracted ones pushed you off a table, and pow: you were dead. Yes, the fingers were indeed lethal!   Mariam: The Fingers, my friend, are never written as the fingers…they are always written as The Fingers. I thought everybody knew that. You know you are quite right about them being lethal. They hold the seesaw that tiptoes between life and death for the colors. But they held an even more important occupation. They were the lines by which the creativity flew from The Brain to The Paper.   Amina: Dearie, tell us what the Fingers have brought to you. What have they led you to sketch? To paint? To draw? Oh my sweetie, I think you forgot to also write: the Fingers let the soul speak as they write the words of the heart. What have your Fingers written? Care to share with us what your nasty heart thinks up of? We so want to laugh. Go ahead and amuse us. :D   Mariam: Amuse you? I think you have mistaken the word amuse for the word inspire. But I don’t mind telling you anyway. I was thinking where I would be, Insha Allah, in less than a week. Specifically about our voyage, our adventure…our trip to Egypt. But I hadn’t gotten so far as to arriving there; I’d just gotten to the airplane. How wondrous it is to fly. To feel as one feels on a roller coaster. The delicious feeling that you have conquered the world. That you have reached the highest peak. Everything appears microscopic. Buildings and houses look like doll houses and cards from up above. Trees appear to be little grasses. People, like specks of moving dust. But what is so ironical is that fact that while you are looking down at everything and thinking of how small the whole world is, everybody under is straining their eyes. Trying to find the tiny airplane in the vast sky. And they are thinking of absolutely insignificant you appear so high above.   Amina: You surprise me…no, really, you really do: that was good! Real good. Now is the time for me to outwit you & write something wittier: something brilliant. Ever heard of an ice cube? It’s frozen: it’s solid. But before it was solid, it was liquid…it was water. Then it froze…once it’s warm again, once it melts it becomes water again. It returns to the liquid phase. *I will now leave you to think of the irony. To see the wisdom in the ice cube. To feel the depth of philosophy from one little ice cube.*  What? How dare you? Me not know what I’m talking about. Well you can just go and kiss my cute a**. The reason why I’m not telling you the mystery of the ice cube is because I don’t want to spoil it for you… I want you to find it ever heard that one before from a grownup? You have…good, then you know what I really mean. :P!  Mariam: You can not write about an ice cube like that! What kind of storytelling is that? Let me begin for you. Once upon a time, there was a water bottle. A man came and poured some warm water into a tray, made up of tiny empty houses. The liquid flowed through, almost passed the brim…just touching the sky. And then the man placed the tray in the frigid north freezer. The air was frigid. Only shrieking icy wind ran through the freezer, making the water colder and colder. They would cry from how scared they were and slowly they turned into hard, ice cubes.   Then one the day, the man took the ice cubes and put them in a pitcher. A pitcher full of warm water. And do you know what happened? The ice cubes bounced a bit on the liquidy trampoline, until they finally fell down…down touched the bottom of the pitcher. The water began to surround the ice cubes, to warm them, and the ice cubes began to melt. Their hearts opened again because they were in such a warm and loving environment and the ice cubes turned into water, inside the water. That is a story, my dearie!   Amina:  nope, that’s not how you write it. Like this:   Flowing through the brooks, the lakes,  Landing in a tiny crystal cup, A spoon of water, a drop of life, Shivering in the glacial air, Frozen as a minuscule prism, Then winds of warmth, blowing away Away the chills, changing the prisms into Water, the quencher of the thirst,  That sprouts the plants, That flows in the brooks,  And in the frozen, ice skating lakes   Mariam: And the blog ends, hence.  For all of you out there…Think of a crayon, an airplane, and an ice cube and the stories and characters that surround us every day!
