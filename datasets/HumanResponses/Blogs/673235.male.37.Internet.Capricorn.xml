       Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  has officially hit the stores this week (I bought the first copy at my local Borders yesterday).  Trilogies have been popular in the movies for years.  This week we look at questions based on some famous cinematic triumvarites:  1) The  Back to the Future  Trilogy sent Marty McFly 30 years into the future, 30 years into the past (twice!) and 100 years into the past.  Which of these time periods would you like to visit in your 1.21 gigawatt-powered DeLorean, and why?   (Note: Thanks to  urlLink  Logtar   for the idea for this question)   2) The  Lord of the Rings  Trilogy was, of course, based on a famous trio of novels by JRR Tolkien.  What sci-fi/fantasy/genre novels or series would you like to see turned into a Peter-Jackson-directed/George-Lucas-written/Steven-Speilberg-produced trilogy?  3) Next summer, there will be two complete  Star Wars  trilogies in the history books.  What's your strangest or most interesting Star Wars experience?   Bonus)  While the  Jurassic Park  and  Indiana Jones  movies are currently only trilogies, plans are in the works for a fourth movie in both series.  What trilogy might've been better served with a fourth movie?  Which trilogy would've been better if they had left it at only one movie?  That's it till next time!  Be sure to leave your name and blog address in the Comments when you've answered the questions.  And remember, as the  Terminator  said in the first part of his famous trilogy, "I'll be back." urlLink

      Ok, this is the week a lot of you have been waiting on.   urlLink  Spiderman 2   opens, and the web-slinger (who in reality would have no shot at Kirsten Dunst) swings back into action against the evil Doc Ock.  This week, our questions are about those quintessentially misunderstood, ill-treated, feared and respected champions of truth, justice and the Spandex Way: the Superheroes.  1) All right, have it out.  What is the all-time greatest superhero movie?  2) What superhero movie has not been made that you'd like to see? Which existing one would you have redone from scratch?  3) What qualities would be necessary to elevate a superhero movie from a simple action film to a memorable motion picture?  Is it possible?  BONUS) Most superhero movies take place in a more-or-less realistic modern world.  If a superhero actually appeared in your city today and started fighting crime, what would be the actual public reaction?  Don't forget to put your name and website in the comments section, and remember:  And remember,  urlLink  EXCELSIOR  !
