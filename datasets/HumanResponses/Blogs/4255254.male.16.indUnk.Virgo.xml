      I'm so bloody hell sick of goin to sch..every morning i gt to force myself to wake up..den ish back to my farking routine life..draggin my feets to school and attending lessons..how i wish i had done well fer my PSLE..n i wun be struggling like fark rite now..i ve no one to turn to and juz can vent my frustrations on bloggie..there ish no sense of urgency in me at all..i'm juz farking damn lazy to touch my books..can any1 help..? haixx rotting everyday after sch..since i m back frm sch i ve been online..well i wonder how can i cope if my com breaks down..everything juz sux rite now..dnt deadline ish nearing and i m no where near completion..n next, ish prelim..4get abt tht..i m bound to flunk..n perhaps even the O levels too..i gt to admit is difficult to cope..sec5 werk ish much tougher than N levels werk..ish nearing september..i dun wish to giv up at tis period of da tym..but i m on da verge of breaking down..i seems fine in reality..but da actual fact ish i noe i m a potential O levels failer !! ARghhh!%^!%@ -.-''

      I m such a disappointment..i gt back my geography test and i flunked it..it may b juz a common test but i did nt xpect to fail..perhaps i was over confident ?? tis daes i dunno wad's exactly rong wif me..sumtimes things may nt be as complicated as i may tink n yet i kip pondering over it..realli TTM !! ish onli abt 70 daes to O levels..and i haf nt started revising..n worse stil, i dun feel any pressure at all..n abt bgr, i haf no comments at all..blame me fer falling fer her but i ve no control over my feelings fer her at all..we may haf doubts fer each other..but plx dun question my feelings fer you..blame it tht i cant made it clear to u..blame it tht i sound so unconvincing coz i ve proven nth at all..u ve ur own dreams and plans and i respect ur decesion..if u feel pressurised, i will leave u alone coz if it ish really meant to be, we will definitely be tgt one day..i m trying to be optimistic though i dun haf high hopes it will turn out da way i long fer..as fer now, i wish u can study hard and nt slack anymore..da same goes fer me..i juz want u to stay happy..i wanna do my bez fer O levels so tht i wun break another promise agn..

      Why?? she was leading 3-1 and da worst possible scenario juz happen..she lost 4-3..i cant bring myself to believe it..i was pissed off wid how da opponent behave..it sux she shouted n juz stare at jiawei throughout da game..kinda using her lame antics to sux her opposition' morale haixx it was nv meant to be..jiawei had no luck at all..congrats to da north korean and to be fair to her, she showed true grit by playing to her strength to win da last 3 sets..wish her all da bez and whu noes? she may even clinch da gold medal wif da help of her lame antics..as fer jiawei i wish she can win da bronze medal fer singapore..n most importantly, fer herself and it was a pleasant sight to realize there were greeks supporting jiawei during the match..lastly, pray tht she can regain her self confidence before da last match where da bronze medal ish at stake..da bez player wins and todae da north korean proved juz tht..
