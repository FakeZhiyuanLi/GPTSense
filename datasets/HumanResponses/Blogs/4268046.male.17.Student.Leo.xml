       every now and then, when i see pretty gals, i will like "i gonna get them" without knowing wat actually they are. so the phase "dont jugde a book by its cover" is so true.  i read some gals web page and i found out tat most of the gals are emotional, just like wat i always thought of.  for an example, one of my female frien, she is very emotional and unpredictable. i used to hang around wif but its getting less and less. y? its all because shes too unpredictable. she will be laughing for the 1st 2 mins but she will be mad at someone in next 2 mins. see wat i mean?  another 1, a couple of days ago, i was in my class and there was a female frien of mine. i was talking to her, but she suddenly bursted and started to offend me. i was like "wat the hell*%#^&" after the next 2 mins, she came back to herself and talked to me in a friendly way. but i didnt burst. try to imagine if some1 scolded without any reasons, and u r trying to hold it. tats a very hard thing to do, isnt it.
