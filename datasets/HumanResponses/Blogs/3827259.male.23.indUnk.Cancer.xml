      After a gruelling two weeks of work n study, I finally got time to blog (brag?) about my trip to Washington D.C that I had refered (see CGI.pm for the spelling) to in my earlier post.     We (Vishwanath, Charan, Srikanth, Seshan, myself) started on a bright Saturday morning from Buffalo, NY in a Chevvy Cavalier. For a person who drives a Japanese car with stick shift, a Chevvy with auto gear was not very thrilling. After a hearty breakfast, we hit the highway at 8.30 and cruised along at a nice pace of 70 miles/hr. Then Vish took over from me. He had been wanting to drive ever since we started and after a lot of persuading and pestering I finally handed over the wheel to him after an hour and a half. He was nervous in the beginning but soon overcame that to drive smoothly. The route we took , US - 15 though scenic had a lot of traffic and we sometimes had to move at as low as 40 miles/hr. After a while, I took over again and madness took over me.    I like driving and I like driving fast but not dangerously fast. 80 miles/hr is a good speed and I normally drive at around that speed, sometimes touching 85. And thats precisely how, I should have been driving that day. I was doing 95, 100 and was in full control. The car was pretty new and was very different from mine. I was getting away with doing 100 and no cop in sight or thats what I thought. I was climing up this slope doing 95 and just as I was about to go downhill, I saw a cop waiting for his prey. I braked hard, but it wasnt enough. He had already made his kill for the morning. He caught me at 88 and locked me at 80.     I gave him some crap about the road being downhill and that the car needed a lot of power. He wasnt willing to buy any of that and gave me a ticket. The dreaded moment I dint want to happen in my life had happened. My record has been tarnished and I'll have to live with it for the next seven years. It was a good lesson for me and it has taught me to keep my excitement under check. I thought of contesting the ticket as I believed that I had a chance of getting away with this. But the drive was too long and I felt that I needed this to restrain myself from any harakiri in the future. But it did not hamper my spirits by a long way. We continued driving at good speed and reached Washington D.C in 8.5 hours which was not bad at all considering that we stopped atleast three times.             The start had been very disappointing and I was concerned about how it was going to turn out. It wasnt all that bad but it certainly could have been better. When we reached, I had forgotten about my ticket and was planning for the next two days of our trip which I'll recount in my next blog. In the meanwhile if you have any questions on how to get a speeding ticket, feel free to mail me. ;)                 Oh boy !! Am I proud of my narrative skills ? Laloo could write better !!

      Hello ppl,     This is my first blog. I am Sripathi Guruprasannaraj ( or long_name_raj), a Master's student at SUNY Buffalo. Its been a while since I have written anything, so I am left fumbling for words here. Anyway my passions are driving, programming, music and books and traveling. I like to visit new places and some places I have already visited. And thats precisely what I am doing tomorrow. I am going to Washington D.C with my friends for the long weekend. I have been there before and got attracted to the Capital instantly. Ever since I have been longing to go there and this is a perfect opportunity. Not only would it be good to go back once again, its also a great drive to there. So am looking  forward to the trip tomorrow. Hmm now I cant seem to stop. I want to write a lot more but I guess I'll stop now or else come back again later this evening.  Have a nice weekend folks !!  Raj  PS: If anyone from Washington read this, gimme tips on places to park and places to eat in the Capital.
