      Finally the accounting's result come out today..when i just enter the FOSEE classroom..1 of my fren told me tht i get 19% for tht..i'm abit shock n didt believe her..^then angie ask me go to see the result together with her at madam chong office,coz madam chong already paste the result outside her office..    Even after i seen the result..i still couldn't believe it..i check my result for few time to make sure i didt happy kosong~^=p hehe.. i'm feel happy for it..but in the other hand..i wonder y i so careless for the tiny little mistakes..i nearly get full 20%,i always cant be satisfied and always wanted perfect,although i know it is unattainable..this is not a good sign..i'm now trying to rip off of it..actually last time i'm not like tht 1..but donno y now become like tht now..may be is becoz of my horoscope..^virgo's ppl mostly are perfectionism 1..hopefully i wont jump into it too deep..or else ..i'll get very very very very very x 100 sad easily if i received any failure..    although happy for accounting..but when think of last nite english..haih..still abit sad..if i excel in certain subject but fail either 1 also useless..just like my english..screw up eveyrthing,every effort i've put on my others subject....T.T....i may be too negative already..but i really cant think about another posiive way la..^~AaaHhHh~~^    Just now went to pasar malam..eat hokkien mee at there,drink soya juice + cincau at there..very nice~=P and now just after bath..going to study econ already..this friday got econ test OoOo...pa pa..^

But we gosipping and talk alot of nonsence suff at nite..maybe too tension already..so had to say something to cheer up everyone!! then 1 of my fren here name kean loon is very very silly 1~^ sampat as us also~!but he was so intelligent...especially in math..damn cool man..his record is fabulous..so smart..n very knowledgeable in psychological things also..  he ask us to draw 4 tree..reers to the picture..he can see through our pass,present n future..^ me, soo yee n sandra draw our own tree seperately then wait for his explanation..for mine 1..the thins tt she predict just nearly same with the reality..almost 98% the same..he say the 1st tree present tht when i was small.."i jealous 1 of my family member"..yap..tht was true..i used to jealous to my sister,becoz i always think tht my prent sayang her more than i..last time when small..i use to lock my slef in the room and crying over the night..so pity ho..tht time still immature la..*    and the second tree tht full of fruits show tht "i'm leading a happy life in high school..use to drop in the relationship problem..love and all kind of tht"..while tht third tree shows tht "i'm working hard on study now"..hm..this 1 i agree..i study so hard..and become more independent..however the 4th tre tht shows my future predict by him as.."i'm confusing with my future..i never be confidence enough.." ...hm...yap..this 1 i just have to admit it..i really never be confidence enough.even i'm already decide tht i wan to study accounting..but i donno wheather this kind of calculation job suit me or not..and is it really is my future?!...so confuse..-_-"
