      Yesterday I went to my GP's office for my three-month check-in to make sure my weight and blood pressure are coming down, as well as to donate some blood for the benefit of checking my CRP (apparently, cholesterol screening isn't in the cards this time). Anyway, since sometime in late February when I started doing these routine checkups, I've approached trips to Dr. Sadler's office to see Amy (her PA, whom I almost always see) with nothing less than excitement and glee. Watching the slider on the scale continue to move to the left is a genuinely fulfilling thing. I was worried when, in April, we moved our monthly check-ins to quarterly -- worried, because those monthly checks were very motivating in terms of getting my butt moving and setting monthly goals. So, it felt like an eternity since I'd last been when I arrived yesterday afternoon.  I was in a really great mood. Yesterday I had a fabulous day at work; I got a lot done in the five hours I was there and felt quite energetic as I headed to Garland. My weight check was good; their official number puts me at 59 pounds lost -- as I've been saying on my  urlLink home page  for a while, I've been hovering around 60 pounds lost for nearly a month. My blood pressure was also good (considering one of the meds Amy's got me on elevates blood pressure) -- it was 124/85. Even the blood-taking went well, mostly (I think) because I told the woman before I ever sat down that we needed to focus on the left arm, get in and out quickly, and distract me well so I wouldn't cry. She did just that, I didn't cry, and I don't even think I'm going to have a bruise there. Outstanding!  However, the real reason I wanted to make this post about going to the doctor is that I want to share a picture of my GP's PA, Amy. She's the person who said, "Look, the real problem here is that you need to lose weight. So ... what are we gonna do about that?" I've been overweight my entire life, and Amy's the first person in the medical profession (or, really, anywhere) who's ever given me that kind of swift kick in the ass. We all know the weight's come off because of the hard work and lifestyle changes I've done and made, but I shudder to think when I would have made the necessary mental committment to this process had Amy not been a true catalyst. She demanded more from me, which in turn inspired me to demand more from *myself*. I can't tell you how much that means to me.   Anyway, at the risk of embarassing myself (which I did) and feeling like a fool (which I do), I insisted we have a nurse take our picture yesterday. This is me at my halfway point; I eagerly await the finish-line photo with us once I've reached my goal.

      First things first!   A great big, huge, enthusiastic  CONGRATULATIONS  goes out to AnnaLisa, who finished her bar exam earlier this week. I got an e-mail from her today saying she has mixed feelings about her actual performance, and is hoping for the best / preparing for the worst. To celebrate the fact that it's over, she's going to rest up in DC a bit and then head to Fargo to visit her parents for a couple of weeks.  And next, tomorrow is my three-month GP checkup. While this isn't quite the same grounds for celebration, I'm rather anxious to check in with the doctor and make sure I'm still pointed in the right direction. I'll also be donating blood for the purposes of getting cholesterol, CRP, etc., checked. Here's hoping I don't pass out or leave the office in sobs. If I do -- either -- and even if I don't, though, I'll be sure to make up for it by doing something fun Friday night. ;)

      I have finally bought tickets and requested time off (er, maybe that was the wrong order? haha) to go to Hawaii to visit my  FAVORITE  aunt & uncle, Fred & Dalis. Um, not respectively. ;) Anyway ... hooray! {happy dance}  Travel dates are Sept. 22-28 (+ wee small hours Sept. 29 for return flight).   Just for good measure, and 'cause I'm so excited I get to see them, let's have some show-n-tell, eh? :)     Here's Fred, at his "wedding" (code word for "officer ceremony thingy")    And here's Dalis & me at one of our past Gilbert Family Reunions.

      If my sources are correct -- and why it's so damned hard to find good information a month before football season starts is beyond me -- then Friday, September 10, 2004, will be the day (mark my words, friends!) that the Bombers of  urlLink Mountain Home High School   WILL  defeat the Harrison Goblins.  I'm already plotting the road trip. Everyone is invited. Take Friday off; the caravan leaves for northern Arkansas promptly at 10 a.m.! The reward for your tagging along is seeing me at my absolute craziest: screaming, singing, yelling, chanting, cheering, jumping, exclaiming, and finally ... yes,  celebrating  the win we've awaited these two decades!  A love of football is totally optional. ;)

      Most days, I read my hometown newspaper to keep up on what's happening. And this story caught my eye today, mostly because it got its own section (it's not a "news brief") and had two paragraphs. And, don't fail to notice the fact that it appeared FOUR DAYS after it happened! Geez! Tuesday must've been a historically slow news day!   urlLink Family takes off without paying   {from Wednesday's edition of the  urlLink Baxter Bulletin }  A family ate at the Red Fern Restaurant in Mountain Home, then left without paying under the pretense they were going outside to smoke while they waited on an order of frog legs to go, according to a report at the Mountain Home Police Department.   The family, two adults and two children, had dinners and several drinks valued at a total of $95.26, the report said. The incident happened Saturday.

      I saw the absolutely coolest kitchen gadget-I-don't-have on an episode of a BBC show called "Kiss Me Kate" in the wee small hours Saturday night. It was a two-handed oven mitt with fabric between the two hand compartments. I really don't know how to describe it ... but suffice it to say, it was awesome. To illustrate just how cool this is, I thought I'd appropriate a picture from the only place online where I could find an example. The one on the BBC show was much prettier and nicer, but this is the idea:    urlLink

      When I told Gary, Julie and Paul at dinner tonight (which was in Lewisville and which I left at 9:30 p.m.) that I'd have my homework (which I'd not yet started at that point) done and turned in, and hoped to be in bed, by 11 p.m., they sorta looked at me funny.  But, thank you very much, I just turned in my homework (time check: 10:50 p.m.) and am now en route to taking Rags out one last time tonight. Alright. So maybe it'll be 11:15 p.m. when I'm actually IN bed. Just let the record show that my homework was due at midnight and I turned it in a full two hours *EARLY*.  Oh yeah, and I was ten minutes early to dinner tonight, too. Not that I'm keeping track or anything. ;)

      Yesterday, I *finally* saw the new quasi-independent movie  urlLink "The Door in the Floor."  The film is based upon the first third of my favorite novel of all time, John Irving's epic  urlLink "A Widow for One Year" , which I have long claimed is the book that makes me want to write.   My review? Given that I haven't read "Widow" in at least three or four years, I had forgotten enough of the details not to spend the entire time scrutinizing the film for accuracy. Probably a good thing. The mood of the movie was perfect, though; it was dark and somber and quiet. The music was grand and sweeping without being overbearing. The acting -- wow! Jeff Bridges and Kim Basinger were perfect for their respective roles as Ted and Marion Cole; Eddie was also played very well. The ending of the movie -- which had concerned me, since the scope of the movie is only a third of the actual story -- was incredibly chilling, I thought; the last couple of minutes of film had no background music, and the first few minutes of credits also rolled without music. Talk about a haunting ending!  I didn't cry at the movie. Sunday was a one of my "funk" days anyway, so I'll admit that afterwards, I did get a little teary-eyed. Had Gary and Julie not rescued me by going to dinner (and, more importantly, giving me a chance to down a margarita, ole!), I shudder to think how my evening would have ended. But, it was a good day. Good night. Quiet, reflective, enjoyable.  If you'll indulge me on a little vague tangent, I recognize not everyone reading this knows me well, or is involved in my life to the point of knowing what's going on day to day. However, I believe in giving credit where it's due, and to that end, I just want to say a little public thank-you to Julie. I've not had lots of close female friends over the years, and having that experience with someone like Julie has been one of my life's great blessings. Her heart is pure gold, and her spirit tremendous. I don't even have to say anything or do anything, yet she seems to intuit what's going on in my head. I've always believed you know you've found a good friend when you can't figure out what bizarre stroke of luck brought that person into your life, and heaven knows that's how I feel about having met her. So everyone, please, raise a glass to one Julie Suits, someone who's inspired me and made me laugh in a way few people do! :)  OK. {/tangent}  I'd also like to mention that the musical "Big River" on Saturday night, which I saw with my oldest friend, Erbey (aka "Herb") and fellow  urlLink YAPper  TJ, was *OUTSTANDING*. The music was really what made the show, IMO. I ordered the cast recording, and cannot wait to listen! I highly recommend going if you ever have the chance to see it.

      Okay, everyone, if you've been following the ascending ticker (of sorts) on my homepage, you know that I'm teetering dangerously close to the 60-pounds-lost mark in my ongoing efforts to shed a Backstreet Boy (credit: "America's Sweethearts").  Although I recognize this breaks with the mold of what people in general -- and women in particular -- are comfortable sharing, I've gotten to a place in this journey (forgive the reality-show jargon there) that real numbers don't seem quite so crazy to share. That, and the few people with whom I've shared these numbers haven't reacted with horror -- at least not obvious horror to me directly -- so ... aw, what the hell?  Here's a run-down of the data I have right now.  ** As of July 2002 (shortly after I moved to Texas), my "women's" doctor weighed me at 238. ** The following July ('03), the same doctor weighed me at 268. Yikes! ** On January 22, 2004, a day which will live in infamy, my GP weighed me at my documented highest-ever weight, 283. The nurse and I both nearly had heart attacks on the spot.  ** As of Friday, July 23 ('04), my "women's" doctor has my official weight at 226. I go back to my GP next Friday (7/30) for an official update using the same scale that recorded the record high. I've got every reason to believe that official weight will be the 223 (at least) that I'm aiming for.  ** My initial goal was to lose about 120 pounds, putting my end weight at or around 165. Basically, that's a Backstreet Boy. ;) I'd like as much of that 120 to come off this calendar year, but I'm patient with my body and myself.  Whew! That's my story. :)

      In case you haven't heard, my parents have decided to buy a new house in Hawaii, on Oahu (the island with Honolulu). They're buying a brand-new townhouse that will be finished sometime around next March. As they don't plan to rent it out to short-term vacationers or anything, official "Friends of Liz" will one day be invited to vacation Chez Norell on Oahu.  My dad gave me the URL for the development tonight; it's called  urlLink Ocean Pointe,  and you'd better believe you pay for that extra "e"!!

      Some time back, Scott sent me a link to a Snob Quiz on the PBS site. I think the original/old quiz is gone, but there's a  urlLink new Snob Quiz available  now!   So I want to hear from you all: What's your score? Post in the comments section!  I am officially 57% snob. Here's their description:  "It's touch and go, Liz -- you're 57% snob. You're a long way off joining the ranks of the blini-nibbling, bubbly-sipping, double-barreled snob brigade, but then you're no champion of the proletariat, either. If you haven't got a Volvo, Golden Retriever and 2.4 kids yet, you soon will have, because the middle classes beckon."

      Last night, I had my biweekly date with my trainer, Sarah -- my first in ten days because of my trip to DC. I arrived a bit early to change clothes and warm up on the treadmill before we got started. Just as I was wrapping things up on the treadmill, a random woman who I see occasionally at the gym walked over to my treadmill and said this to me:  "Hi, I remember when you first started working out here, and I just wanted to tell you that you look great -- I can tell you've lost weight, and you look really good."  {blush}   It totally made my day!

      These are just a few lines I heard in various contexts (not the least of which was the completely hilarious Will Ferrell movie, "Anchorman") today that I strongly feel ought to appear in everyday conversation more often. In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that some (if not most) of these have undoubtedly been tainted by my legendarily poor memory, but you get the jist. In no particular order:   I just want to be *on* you.   San Diego is German for "whale's vagina."   Actually, I was just trying to impress you. I don't think anyone knows what it [San Diego] means anymore. The translation was lost hundreds of years ago.   Great Odin's raven!   Son of a bee-sting!   I'm storming your castle on my steed, m'lady.   Knights of Columbus, that hurt!   Fancy a quick snog?   The last one's my favorite, though. :)

      Yesterday, after my time in downtown DC playing the part of unwilling tourist, I found a seat at the center of the Mazza Gallerie with a little low-lactose, sugar-free frozen concoction and a Diet Pepsi to finish up "The Warrior Elite," the book John sent me.   From start to finish, this book totally captivated my attention. I find it very hard to put into words what I'm feeling in the wake of having read the book. However, I can say that the respect I have for those who endure the BUD/S training is incalculable.   As for the guy who sent the book, John -- I know nobody reading this blog has ever met him, but I hope you'll get the chance to someday. He shared this book with me to help me understand better some of the experiences he's had in his life. I'm so grateful he did -- I feel blessed to have been given a chance to get to know him these last several months.  Ok, ok, I know this is sappy, but when you experience something as overwhelming as I have the last week, the thoughts hafta go somewhere. :)  In short, I would *highly* recommend you pick up the book post haste and give 'er a good reading. I made the book stretch out over a week and spent my non-reading time anxiously awaiting the moment when I could again open the cover. You will be moved. Trust me.

      Good morning! I got up extremely early today, because:  1) AnnaLisa left extremely early for her last all-day bar exam practice test. I wanted to at least grunt at her before she left (but in fact, I was fully conscious and managed something more elegant than a grunt!).  2) I haven't started packing yet.  3) I have to allow time for at least two flat tires. 4) Pentagon City beckons me!   So what am I doing? Checking e-mail, of couse!  My feelings about this imminent departure are rather mixed. There are few places in this world that can rival the energy and pace of Washington, D.C. To say that I feel melancholy about having ever left here (even though I recognize it was clearly the best, and right, decision to do so) is an exercise in understatement. However, in 1999, I was *not* prepared to be living in DC on my own. Had I been here during 9/11 or the sniper shootings, I'm quite sure I would be treating an ulcer today.  And so it is -- as with so many things, the DC area presents me with a double-edged sword: I love it here, and it's terribly bad for me. I'd be willing to bet my blood pressure's higher here, and then there's the whole I'm-allergic-to-DC issue that has sent my allergies this week into overdrive. Yet even with all those negatives, when I was standing in the Holocaust Museum's *gift shop*, for crying out loud, I was utterly overwhelmed with emotion. Live music in the plaza at the Reagan whatever building downtown. Visiting NPR (which was fabulous, by the way). Today, I'm going to drive by the Washington Post on my way to Virginia. Seeing Tucker Carlson through the window sliver in his GW office. I mean, how can any other place compare to those sorts of experiences? They can't, they won't, and I never know how to reconcile that.  But no worries, my friends. I love my job at TWU, and I'm very happy in Dallas (though, I'm *so* not looking forward to giving up these partly-cloudy-and-85 degree-days!). I'm not packing my bags or scouting out places to live in DC. How could I possibly leave all of the great people I've met and gotten to know in greater Dallas? :)

Whee!)  &nbsp;  At any rate, for those curious about the damned hippo, who HAVE heard my hippo rant, or even better who've heard my Fulya&nbsp;story about the word "hippopotamus" -- here's a picture of the damned hippo to give you a visual context for the stories.

      I'm writing from the bookstore at my undergrad alma mater, GW, in downtown DC. The fact that they've set up public Internet access stations at the bookstore that don't require any sort of "Yes, I belong to this institution somehow" validation or login almost makes me feel like those rip-off bookstore prices during my undergrad years went for something good. Well .... maybe that's a stretch, but God knows I feel a little warmth of goodwill spreading through my heart for a place infrequently disposed to inspiring that kind of warmth.  &nbsp;  It's been a great day! NPR *ROCKS*!!! I had a blast there this morning.&nbsp;Today I've also been to the Old Post Office, the National Press Club building, the Holocaust Museum and now here to gee dub to replenish my GW paraphernalia supply. Next will (probably) be the National Gallery of Art, and once I'm done there, I think I'm going to be ready to go back to Friendship Heights to relax a bit before dinner tonight. What a great day! :-)

      Yesterday was an insanely busy day! I saw Mark (my ex) and his redecorated/renovated house, the dogs (including Bailey, who's now EIGHT?!?!), and got a CD from him with three songs from his new band. My photo shoot went well, I think. And I got a sneak peak at the new GW campus (I will be going back today to poke around a bit more and visit, among other things, the new SMPA building and the bookstore).  &nbsp; It was a gorgeous day, though. The temperature maybe maxed out at 85, and the humidity was low. Today (TGIF!) looks to be about the same. (Sorry, Texans.) &nbsp; DC is remarkably changed since I was last here. One of my favorite places, a ratty old diner in Bethesda sitting on prime real estate, is now gone, replaced by two gargantuan towers that Mark says he can see from his house some five or eight miles away. The GW Hospital block is a pile of gravel, and when you come out of the Foggy Bottom metro station, there's this huge, gorgeous, glassy new hospital literally sitting on top of the metro. The Marvin Center (student center) has a random arch and the concrete ramp up to it is gone; the building now extends to the street and has a new, glassy, gorgeous facade. In short, everything is different! Today, as I explore downtown, I'll find out just *how* different. &nbsp; Hard to believe it's been five and a half years since I left DC. REALLY, really hard to believe. I miss the people and the places so much! Driving around Wednesday night after I returned from the eastern shore, I was hit with wave after wave of nostalgia. I've got my DC-driving groove back, and I just adore flitting around town. It's so much fun! &nbsp; Today's my "DC day." I will be downtown almost all day (as soon as I get off my duff and get moving!) and then out to dinner with AnnaLisa and Paul tonight. I'm going to be sad to leave tomorrow, as it's been so wonderful to spend some time with then here. That having been said, I'm missing Rags and all you wonderful people who've been so faithfully following this travelblog, so I am happy I'll be back home soon. &nbsp; More tonight, mes amis!

      I just have to post this one.  I found a fishing pier not far from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and as I was walking out to the end to take pictures of the bridge itself, the real story turned out to be a crab a guy caught. As he pulled it out of the water on his fishing line, everyone around yelled, "Good crab!" {shrug} Must be a Maryland thing.    urlLink     Click for a bigger one!

      But here is one of the pictures I took tonight on my way back to DC from Salisbury. I caught the Chesapeake Bay Bridge at sunset, and got some outstanding photos with the digital camera. I cannot believe I took these. I hope I haven't used up all my photography mojo before I even get to the official photo shoot!    urlLink     Click for a bigger one

      Wow! I swear, in all my life, I never would have thought a post on *gmail* would be the one to give life to an honest-to-goodness *debate*! {shrug} I have clearly misunderestimated!  On a related note, I actually -- I cannot BELIEVE this -- got a gmail invite. Seriously. It came from Allen from Allen. {/commentary}  So it's settled. There have been upwards of 700 page views for this blog in less than a week's time -- which frankly also has surprised the hell out of me. May the travelblog live longer than this trip! :)  MUCH gratitude to you all for your interest and your company!  liznorell@gmail.com {happy dance}

      If you want to see geeks get all fired up, bring up Gmail. Those who've got it shrug with quiet modesty and/or arrogance. Those who don't immediately begin begging for an invite.  I first heard about it from my brother. Then yesterday, I saw three women beg a guy from Canada to invite them to try it out. (But then again, that happened at the end of the day, and their disproportionate excitement could have been blamed on intellectual burnout.) Right now, it's available by invitation only.  Now I wanna have a look! What the hell's the fuss all about? Anyone got a Gmail account? Want to invite me??  PS: For those non-geeks, Gmail is Google's beta e-mail; Gmail users get a *GIG* of storage space!

      I went to Ruby Tuesday's tonight at the Salisbury mall -- which was, in itself, a dangerous tactical error.  I would just like to point all of you who are interested in dining with knowledge to Ruby Tuesday's (not that we've got a damned one in the greater Dallas area, GRR!) -- their menu lists calorie, fat, carb and fiber counts for *all* items.   They have a low carb cheesecake that claims to have a single "net carb." I would have tried it, except -- even though I asked about it three times before I ordered my meal -- my server never asked if I wanted dessert. I have a rule that if they don't ask, I don't order. So maybe I'll try some before I head back to Texas. Come to think of it, I *do* need an excuse to go to Pentagon City (says Jen: "Pentagram!").   The last time I was at Pentagon City (which is a shopping mall conveniently located on the Metro [subway] near the Pentagon, for those of you unfamiliar with DC) was the week of my college graduation, with my brother and once-favorite cousin Tresa; while at the mall, we watched "Shakespeare in Love" and Tresa laughed at me for crying. Ahhh, the memories!  Round two of Maryland postcards go out tomorrow!

      I could give you all the background information for this breaking news item, but as it's only marginally interesting to me, I figure it would be boring as hell to you.   So let me cut quickly to the bottom line: I have a meeting set up at 11 a.m. Friday with an NPR librarian! *AT* NPR headquarters!! I'm beyond excited! :)

      Call it a "backward tongue" if you will (Michael), but the French expression above is one of my longtime favorites and it *totally* applies right now: My brain feels like it's applesauce right now. I've absorbed just about all the information I can absorb at this point, and (thankfully!) there's just one more session today. This poor, poor guy who's setting up his presentation right now, man, he has to try to beat information into brains attached to bodies that have been sitting in windowless conference rooms for two days. Awww.  Still, it's been good. I went to an utterly fabulous session this morning by two guys from Georgetown University. And learned *so* much! And logged onto the GU site during the session to see if I could get a job there. ;) Not that I want to leave my job, or leave Texas. However, those two guys who lead the discussion represented IT *and* marketing, respectively, *AND* they got along! Worked together! Collaborated! Finished one another's sentences! {gasp} I envy that.  I would like to report that I finished my homework *and* turned it in a full TWO HOURS prior to the absolute deadlined last night. {bow}  Also, that I've been working on the book John sent me about Class 228 of the Navy BUD/S training program (the hard-core induction training phase involved in becoming a Navy SEAL), and I'm utterly fascinated by it. I'm going to finish it tonight, if possible. Yes, I've got 200 pages to read, but it's just THAT good. And, I want to get through at least one more worthless chick book while I'm on (ahem) "vacation" and then get well into our next book club pick, "The Things They Carried."   If you want to pick this one up, though, it's called "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch.

      Those of us who have been living in Texas recently know that June was a great month for weather (if you share my tastes in weather, anyway) -- it's been cool and rainy for most of the month. Someone told me we got a record amount of rain in Texas for June, actually. That's all well and good, but given recent events, I'm starting to think my rainmaker powers, identified during high school, have returned.   That's because yesterday in Maryland, particularly up by Baltimore, they got flood-level amounts of rain. There was video all over the news last night of stranded motorists, flooded cars, and more rain on the way today and probably tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Weather Channel tells me the weather in Texas today will be hot (95ish degrees) and sunny. (Incidentally, rain isn't in the forecast for Denton until Monday, about 36 hours after I return home.)   Hmmm. Coincidence?  Liz

      So as previously discussed, I'm totally geeking out over here on the Eastern Shore with my laptop and wireless Internet connection, right? And earlier today, right before our *fascinating* 11:15 a.m. session about "Milennials" (kids born after 1982ish), I was tapping out an e-mail to my gal pal Julie when, behind me, I overheard a guy telling someone that he went to GW. My ears piqued up and I swiveled in my chair (sans the 56ish pounds, I can do that with amazing ease these days!). I said, "Me too!" And then the woman sitting next to me, equally geeking out on her laptop and wireless connection, made it a "Me three!"   As it turns out, though, the guy behind me was: 1) In my graduating class at GW -- May 1999. 2) In my program -- journalism majors rocked! 3) In at least one of my classes while I was there.  In short, echoes of "it's a small world..." were running through my consciousness. How cool is that?!  And actually, to my great surprise (considering I'm one to remember faces quite well), the person in question, Mike Roberts, actually mentioned he had recognized me earlier in the day and again when we came into the breakout room for this Milennials session. Huh! Go figure! And here, all these years, I was thinking I made a miniscule impression upon those in my journalism classes.   Lest I waste an opportunity to give props to my peers, Mike is the Webmaster ("an army of one") at the  urlLink College of Southern Maryland .  On a side note, it's appropriate that a fellow GW alum would inspire echoes of that dreadful Disney song, as it was my GW resident assistant Rob ("LOB!") who told stories to me that made the song dreadful in the first place.

      {From the conference during dessert break -- in which I cannot participate, dangit!}  Web geeks at a conference for IT, marketing and admissions people are easy to pick out: We have the laptops. We sent in MAC addresses ahead of time. And so we, ladies and gentlemen, have wireless Internet access everywhere in the building in which the conference is being held! And, since my hotel's high-speed wireless access is weak in my room, I'm totally jazzed about being able to get my broadband fix between sessions.  Last night I went to Tia's for dinner. Background: When I moved to Denton, I became a fast fan of Tia's for their yummy queso and homemade tortillas. Now, against that backdrop, I think I can now officially slip into snobby Texan mode. Even though this was a *chain restaurant* (and thus ought to have had some quality-control measures in place), my dinner *TOTALLY SUCKED*. The queso was cold, the tortillas were tiny and doughy, and the fajitas were totally sans sizzle when they arrived. Maybe they were just having an off day. I am trying to resist the urge to criticize the Eastern Shore's food. However, the dinner I was given last night was a crime against tex-mex.  OK, I'll refrain from further snobby Texan commentary. ;)  I'm still dragging a bit after three nights of utterly insubstantial sleep, but I did get in about seven or eight hours' worth last night. Given that I need to finish up a homework tonight and want some sleep (and a workout, and ... ;)  ), I may skip out of the geek crabfest. Isn't that just terrible -- turning down free crabs?!?!  I'm on the hunt for postcard stamps. I bought eight (postcardes, not stamps) en route to Salisbury yesterday, and as I flipped through my PDA address book last night waiting for the cold dinner to arrive, I realized that's nowhere near enough. But round one of the Maryland postcards are ready to be sent out.  That's all for now.  UMM, except this PS: Today is a nice pinkish-mauve day. ;)

      DATELINE: Airspace above Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland or DC (exact location is classified), 2:32 p.m. EST, July 10, 2004  Our pilot is chatty. *Really* chatty. He gave us a fantastic "welcome" briefing with general flight description details, then repeated the whole thing a second time because one of the flight attendants said the PA system wasn't loud enough.  This is my first post-9/11 flying experience, and what a difference that's made!! You now hand over luggage to screeners after checking it at the counter. On this flight (to DC), nobody's allowed to stand up AT ALL within the 30 minutes prior to landing. This plane's also colder than any I can remember having been on, but that *may* be unrelated. I dunno. Can you think of any possible correlation? But then, who said security things must make sense? Witness: the color-coded terror-alert system. Ah, but I digress. ;)  At least American Airlines has totally awesome new red, fuzzy fleece blankets now. And in case you're wondering -- yes, I've felt the need to (*whoops!*) let one mistakenly find its way to my bag. Maybe on the way home. :)  I boarded my plane less than 10 minutes before scheduled departure. My father would have had a heart attack had he been with me.

      Well, here we go kids, Liz is going to attempt another blog/semi-regular writing enterprise. Brace yourselves, it could get interesting.  As noted in the description above, the primary purpose of this little blog (for now) is to detail my adventures in DC and Maryland on my impending business trip. Of course, given that I went to school in DC and have a few good friends left there, the next eight days will hardly be *ALL* business. That said, I will be learning lots at the  urlLink Web Communications & Strategies Conference , courtesy o' Salisbury University in eastern Maryland.  It's currently 1:40 a.m. in the wee hours of Saturday, and I'm still packing and preparing my laptop for the trip. I had to make sure I had some means of getting online from afar, lest I:  1) Not be able to update this blog, which in itself would be a genuine tragedy. 2) Not be able to check my e-mail, which would send me into the depths of withdrawal within at least 24 hours. 3) Not be able to do my homework assignment due Monday at midnight (roughly), which would certainly cost me some grade points. 4) Not be able to monitor my work e-mail and communicate with my TWU mates, which would perhaps make this a more enjoyable week away from the office. ;) Just kidding.  So anyway. I'm going to squeeze in a few hours' sleep before getting up again to finish packing in a flurry of anxiety and energy, I'm sure, and head out to hand Rags off to Paul, who's so graciously agreed to entertain Rags while I'm gone. Thank God for good friends.

      I know few of you have actually met and spent time with my friend (and ex), Scott. So I apologize for your lack of context here. However, after a good chat with him today, I just want to say "out loud" that, in spite of whatever "draaaama" our lives may have brought one another over the years, I feel terribly blessed to have someone in my life who knows me so well that explanations are unnecessary; who believes in me, supports me and fundamentally wishes me happiness; and with whom I've shared so much over the years that he can see, as few can, just how sweeping the changes in my life thus far have truly been.   I've always felt extremely honored that I've been able to keep as friends most of the people I've had relationships with in the past. Their continued presence in my life help keeps me grounded and in touch with -- rather than trapped in -- my past. Thank you.

      Ten things I love most about having lost ~ 65 lbs.:  1) I have ten times the energy I had before. 2) I sleep ten times deeper than I used to. 3) I can walk/jog longer and farther than my basset hound, a breed known for its laziness and for standing less than two feet off the ground. 4) I can fit into clothes I've owned for years but never been able to wear. 5) I actually have several pictures of myself that I *like*. 6) I'm not afraid to try anything -- tap dancing, tennis, yoga, kickboxing, parasailing ... it all sounds like a hoot!  7) Precious few people have noticed (or said anything), yet this fact bothers me remarkably little. 8) The selection of clothing in my closet is shrinking, and my biggest ongoing challenge is to find something in there that's SMALL enough. 9) I have no insecurity announcing what I weigh to anyone -- friend or date, man or woman. 10) My success and energy continue to inspire others, which means more to me than I can express.   Five more things I love but that lifetime skinny people probably can't relate to:  1) Feeling collarbones poking through my skin is a joy I can't stop indulging in. 2) I smile every morning when I put on my deodorant because I can see a curve of muscle from my shoulder to my chest. 3) Enjoying a clothes shopping expedition is an entirely new concept for me. 4) Nowadays, I eat whatever I want, whenever I want to, and I never pause first to wonder if other people will see me and think, "Man, fat people NEVER - STOP - EATING!!" 5) I can wear shorts while doing my thirty minutes on the treadmill or elliptical machine without constantly having them ride up.

      The following is excerpted from  urlLink  Newsweek   (Aug. 16, p. 10). I don't know why, but I found this equal parts fascinating and funny.  Americans are used to ordering things ranging from french fries to popcorn in small, medium or supersize. Now those same decision-making skills may become useful in the bathroom, thanks to an innovative plumbing technology: dual-flush toilets. The new gizmos are the industry's latest attempt to help reduce water usage, a movement that hasn't always gone smoothly. The last big toilet makeover came more than a decade ago, when the U.S. government decreed that new toilets should use just 1.6 gallons of water per flush, down from the 3.5-gallon standard that had ruled the industry for decades. But consumers complained that it often took two or more flushes to clear the bowl; so many people preferred the old toilets that some plumbers imported them illegally from Canada.  The dual-flush toilets, which have been used for years in Australia and parts of Europe, rely on a simple concept to increase efficiency; it takes less water to flush urine than it does to eliminate what the industry euphemistically calls "bulk waste." So dual-flush toilets incorporate two flush buttons, or a handle that moves in two directions. The "long flush" uses 1.6 gallons; the "short flush" uses as little as half that amount.

       urlLink Lisa Loeb  is hands-down my favorite singer/songwriter, and a big part of why is in our history together.   Lisa was my virgin experience with live music, at the incomparable  urlLink 9:30 Club  in the U Street corridor in DC. That standing-room-only concert was also my virgin experience with a boy trying to pick me up. (Thank you, Red Cross Guy!!) If you want a clue on how big an impression that night made on me: I -- the one who has no memory -- can actually recall the date (March 1, 1996)!   At any rate, Lisa released a new album last week, and I was kinda ticked off at my pathetic fandom since I didn't know it was out until two days after its release. I made up for it by listening to it pretty much nonstop all weekend while bopping around Dallas, and have two new favorite Lisa Loeb songs: "Probably" and "Will You Wander."

      It's been a sappy kind of day. Well, I mean, except for the whole "fog of war" thing from earlier. ;) I went to see  urlLink "Touch of Pink"  with a couple of fellow  urlLink YAPpers  this afternoon, a delightful British comedy that chronicled the main character, Alim, and his struggle to come out to his very traditional mother desperate for grandchildren and a daughter-in-law. It was hilarious, touching, and well done. Two things I wanted to share from the movie. First was Kyle MacLachlan's brilliant portrayal of Cary Grant himself -- the intonation, the facial expressions, even the gestures were dead on. It was driving me nuts not being able to place the actor, though, as I *knew* I'd seen him in something before. A cheating glance at the movie's Web site, though, reveals that he was Charlotte's horrid husband, Trey, in "Sex in the City."  The second thing I wanted to share was a line of dialogue --  Mom: Laughter is the best medicine.  Son: If that's the case, I must be in the placebo group.  LOL  I also went to see  urlLink "Little Black Book" , which I thought was charming.   The lesson, kids? I rarely see a movie I don't like. ;)

      Last night, I finally watched another movie I've been meaning to see for a while now,  urlLink "Under the Tuscan Sun,"  starring Diane Lane and based on the book of the same name by Frances Mayes. The movie itself was gorgeously filmed, equal parts touching and amusing, and just generally awesome. But the actual story was one that was personally inspirational; I've often hoped that, later in life, I'll be able to buy a house in southern France or Italy somewhere and escape there to write the many stories trapped inside me. It's not something I want to do today, or even soon, but once I've had my adventures here and am ready to tell my stories -- look out Europe! :)  If you want a slice of the life I hope to have, check out  urlLink Frances Mayes's  and  urlLink Peter Mayle's  books. They're among my favorite travel writers!

      I'm not even done watching it yet (it's on as I'm typing this), but I'm already ready to give an unequivocable recommendation that you watch the Academy Award-winning documentary "The Fog of War," the latest documentary to come out of the brilliant mind of the  urlLink documentarian Errol Morris . And watch it soon.  As a grad student of journalism at Arkansas, I took a documentary film class from the incomparably awesome Larry Foley, who -- in addition to teaching -- makes outstanding documentaries of his own. Each week, we were to watch a documentary and write an analysis/critique of it. At some point, I picked up one of Errol Morris's films, and was so impressed by his style and storytelling abilities that I quickly watched every one of his films I could put my hands on.  So when I heard he had tackled the subject of war by looking at the life of Robert S. McNamara, former secretary of defense under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, I knew it would be something that I'd want to watch. I never made it to the theaters to see it, but renting the DVD was high on my list once it was released.  The interviews with McNamara comprise the entire plot of the movie -- the narration, the story, they're all his own words. His commentary on his own actions in World War II ("if we had lost the war, I would have been tried as a war criminal") and the way things unfolded in Vietnam is bitingly honest. People of our generation generally know very little about the human experience in our country during the major events of the Twentieth Century; McNamara gives an honest, clear picture of the drama and emotion of the time he served. At the moment where his sense of history is at its most palpable is when he describes how close America came to nuclear war with Cuba.  The events chronicled in "Fog of War" have fundamentally shaped our country, and I only wish I had been taught more about them (Vietnam, World War II, etc.) instead of the endlessly repetitive classes on the Revolutionary War while in school. Why don't we spend more time teaching our kids about the things that have had genuine, dramatic impact on the lives of people they know -- their parents and grandparents especially? It's something I've never understood.

      Now and then, with no advanced warning or premeditation, a random little gem comes flowing from me -- maybe it's an offhanded comment, or maybe something I type in an IM, or maybe even in an e-mail (which allows for more careful crafting). 'Cause I love you all so much, and because we all know I'd forget them if I didn't write them down, I'm going to share from time to time. Here are a few of my favorites.   GEM #1 (Taking a break from packing the night before Julie's move)  Julie: "You're such a lifesaver. I don't know how I could have finished packing without you."  Liz: "Nah, tonight I'm life support. Tomorrow I'm a lifesaver."   GEM #2 (An IM conversation with my brother at some point earlier this year)  I couldn't get lucky if I'd had a royal flush in one hand and a bouquet of four-leaf clovers in the other.   GEM #3 (Vacationing with teenagers in Florida a few summers back, and observing their behavior in my  urlLink travelog )  By way of keeping you all up to date on our fabulous vacation festivities, I first must warn you that the hormones of our teenage travel companions are raging nearly out of control. "Hottie overload" is the phrase du jour, if you will. In condo 401 lives a boy Casey has made a tentative friendship with named (we think) Chris; the fact that he lives in a state that starts with the letter "A", wears Speedo swimming shorts and is 15 years old is more than Crystal can possibly resist. (Note to self: Need to lower standards to improve excitability.)

      This morning, I was having one of those dreams that was so engrossing that I was actually pissed off my alarm was going off every six minutes and forcing me to leave the dream unfinished.   Before I describe it, though, let me preface by speculating why (I suspect) this dream happened last night. One of the reoccuring topics of conversation lately has been my love of a good ol' fashioned, knee-deep discussion/debate about all manner of things, not the least of which is politics. I'm a confessed political junkie, so much so that (after waffling and reflecting for a month), I'm taking a graduate-level political-science seminar on the American presidency this fall just for fun; literally, I just want an outlet for discussing presidential politics during the election season. I'm weird, we all know this, but the fact that I'll have a weekly slot of three hours to discuss and debate is more thrilling to me than words can express.  This love of mine of a good (political) discussion ... well, sometimes it works out, sometimes not. There are those I know who rarely (if ever) are willing to engage others in full-on political discussion as a matter of course, and I respect that. Knowing your limits and your hot buttons is much better than engaging in a battle of wits that ends with hurt feelings. Others will go so far down the road of political debate that I feel like I'm being attacked, and that's certainly not something I enjoy. Clearly, having someone around who loves debating without taking it personally is something I enjoy, though, and every once in a while I hit the social jackpot and find such a person.  Maybe it's because I'm single and have the occasional date, and am thus exposed to more new people nowadays than I'm typically used to. Or maybe it's because the election season is now in high gear, coming off the Dem's convention in Boston and gearing up for the Republicans in NY shortly. Maybe the imminent arrival of football season and the attendant ramping up of my -- shhhh! -- dislike of the Cowboys has me in a contrary mood. Beats me.  So the dream. It wasn't about politics, so calm yourselves -- that dream will be in October, I'm sure. ;) In the dream, I was traveling with my parents and others. We all had a buttload of stuff, so they sent me ahead with a large portion of the luggage/stuff. The plan (as I loosely recall it) was for me to get things checked in ahead of time so everyone didn't have to fuss with bags and whatnot. Now, were we flying? I can't really remember. The point was that I was fully loaded, though, and for whatever reason was going to my destination via Union Station in DC. Maybe I was catching the Metro at Union Station? Or a train? We'll never know. That's because, in the dream, fully loaded down with stuff, I got stopped at security AT THE FRONT DOOR to Union Station.  For those unfamiliar, Union Station in DC has no security. (At least, it didn't last time I checked, which I'll grant you was pre-9/11.) So, I arrived somewhat flummoxed by the fact that I had to dump all my crap on the conveyor belt to be x-rayed and wander through the metal detector myself. As my stuff when through the machine (and I remind you, I was loaded down), they systematically saw fit to search -- thoroughly -- everything I was carrying. This involved taking piles of clothing, electronics, etc., out of bags, peeking around inside, and leaving it all for me to repack. As I was getting ready to put everything back into the bags, the security guard said, "Since you exceeded the bag limit for going through security, and since it took so long to search everything, the charge is $200."  I was appalled. "WHAT?!" I said, grimacing at the security person -- who, I should mention, had been joking with me and been generally nice woman. (OH yes, I should also mention there was nobody else around -- in security, in Union Station, etc.) She said, "Yeah, I know it's stupid, but we're allotted no more than 60 seconds per person for security checks, and if we take longer, you have to pay."  This went on for a while, until I demanded she fetch me her supervisor. And I swear to you, folks, I argued about this -- PASSIONATELY argued about it -- for at least an hour in dream time. My mom eventually showed up, and when I explained the situation to her, she was ready to give them $200 and move on. I refused. It was the principle of the thing. I wouldn't pay, and as a result, they wouldn't give me the bags back.  For whatever reason, this inspired me to insist we stay overnight so I could formulate a strategy. So we delayed our departure until the next day, and the next morning, I woke up ready to go back to Union Station and argue some more. As we were getting in the car to go back to Union Station, I saw a sign on the back of a car in the distance -- I don't know what it said, exactly, but it was clearly a lawyer specifically hoping to find ME, one who wanted to come argue my case with me. In my dream (now this is weird!!), the lawyer had read my rant about this whole security thing ON THIS BLOG, tracked me down, and said she'd represented (successfully) another woman who had been in the same situation. Her fee? LOL $200.  Anyway, so I woke up at that point -- having spent a lot of time the night before preparing my arguments, then running across this lawyer, and being primed and fired up to go give these idiots a piece of my mind. And I was so, so angry that I didn't get to finish the dream so I could fight with them!!   I'm sorry to bore you all with this story, but I just think it's hysterical. I'm such a dork sometimes.  The moral of the story? If you can't find someone to argue with you, just argue with yourself. Or, if you prefer, with figments of your imagination. :)

      It all started so innocently. I saw a news story or little tidbit somewhere online talking about how the movie  urlLink "About Schmidt"  had profoundly impacted a group called  urlLink Childreach International  when it showed Warren writing to Ndugu, a child in Africa.  God knows why, but I checked out the Childreach Web site, and was so profoundly moved by one of the pictures I saw there that I decided to become a sponsor. The girl who stole my heart was Bridget:

      I can't be sure, but a recent article in the  urlLink Baxter Bulletin , my hometown newspaper, would seem to indicate there's actually no HEAD coach for the mighty Bomber football team this fall. In a separate article, they made mention several times of only the assistant coach. Nor did a roundup of a recent school board personnel meeting suggest a new head coach has been officially hired.   {shrug} I'm not overly concerned. Under the direction of a slew of coaches over the last twenty years or so, the Bombers have managed to lose the Beat Harrison game every time, so perhaps the magic solution this year is to go into the game WITHOUT a head coach?   I'm elated beyond words that  urlLink I've made this game sound exciting enough  to convince not one, not two, but THREE people to *consider* tagging along. Even if not a single one does end up coming, hell, that alone feels like a significant accomplishment!  Tracy, it's too bad you'll have to miss the game! I can feel Bomber spirit catching on! :)

      So, in keeping with my relax-and-bond-with-the-hound theme for the week, I sat down with dinner, Rags, and the movie "Uptown Girls" tonight. To my great surprise, I *really* loved that movie! I like Brittany Murphy anyway, and think Dakota Fanning is one of the most talented child actors I've ever seen (and generally just an amazing actress, regardless of her age). Probably it got terrible reviews -- my particular talent does seem to be falling in love with movies that suck. But anyway, if you're a guy looking for a good date DVD, or a gal looking for a good chick flick, pick it up!  I liked it, anyway. :)  PS: In keeping with the sappy theme for the last few hours/days/weeks ... I totally sobbed! I think my Kleenex box here on the coffee table is now officially depleted. ;)

      I've tried to keep things here relatively light and fun, but I watched an episode of "Oprah" tonight that has got me all serious in the head, and now you get to hear (well, *read*) all about it.  Here's the thing. I've really *not* been an emotional person given to crying for most of my life. (My mom may read this and disagree, but until then, we'll operate on my own assessment of my life thus far.) I mean, significant things happened when I was growing up and I rarely cried about them. Maybe I get all choked up at movies (we'll talk about that presently), but the really important stuff? Not so much.  Two things in my life have proven to be the exceptions, though. Working backwards, the most recent was 9/11; if I let myself dwell on that day for more than a few fleeting moments, I'll be here crying all night. And the first genuinely emotional thing I experienced? My grandmother's struggle with Alzheimer's.  Oprah had a show with Leeza Gibbons and Maria Shriver talking about their own family struggles with this most wretched disease, and along with several less famous guests, they presented a very compelling and moving portrait of the horrors of Alzheimer's. If you have been blessed NOT to have experienced it personally, I hate to be pessimistic (we all know it's not my style), but I can almost guarantee you will someday. Nancy Reagan called it the long goodbye, but it's really just so much more than that. Supporting someone who has the disease is worse than coping with the aftermath of someone having committed suicide; there's no choice involved in an Alzheimer's diagnosis, and you spend anywhere from a few years to a decade or more watching someone you love literally disintegrate before you. The first time they don't recognize you, it breaks your heart; the first time they realize they didn't recognize you, it breaks theirs.  I don't want to get political about the need for funding and research. Ron Reagan (the junior) made a ompelling argument for that in  urlLink his speech at the Democratic convention in Boston  a couple of weeks ago. What I wanted to share in this post is the fact that, more than a decade *after* we said goodbye to my Grandma Avis, all I have to do is think about her for about 45 seconds and I completely lose control. If you haven't experienced this firsthand, might I recommend picking up a book I saw featured on the show called "Losing My Mind." It was written by a man shortly after he was diagnosed, and captures (I'm told) his anger, fear and frustration. This disease will touch us all, and unless a cure is found, we'll be dealing with this for the rest of our lives.

      By any measure, my participation in and enthusiasm for the two classes I took this summer was lackluster. Approaching nonexistant. I got less-than-stellar participation scores (a 70% in one of the classes), but I would self-assess by saying even those marks were generous.  And yet, my friends, I got A's in both of my classes. Maybe not high A's, but dammit, they were A's all the same.  I don't want to sound like I'm complaining here -- really, I'll take an A any day -- but don't you think, um, one should have to exert one's self to get the highest possible grade?  I'm really not ungrateful. I do, however, know myself, and if "they" (the professors, the program, the school, etc.) keep rewarding my laziness, when will I ever have the motivation to be anything else?  But really. I'm glad. Amazed, but happy.

      Julie had a  urlLink very nice post  last night about her moving week. And about her fish.  Speaking of fish, if you haven't heard it, ask Paul to tell you his fish joke. If you don't get it or don't at least giggle and/or groan, you're probably not "Liz people." ;) (I wouldn't normally attach such weight to a joke, but we've conducted some scientific testing on this theory and it's held true thus far.)

      I've been at this whole blog thing for about a month now, and the response has been outstanding. Compliments filtering in and stats on my repeat traffic suggest I've managed to assemble random thoughts that y'all find amusing, interesting, or otherwise worth your time to watch.   In the last few days, though, several people have said something to me along the lines of, "Don't put this on your blog." It struck me as notable when more than one person said it, so indulge me for a moment while I define some ground rules:  1) If there's any discussion initiated here about, um, "dry spells," I promise it will either be about my own or started by someone else in a comment. I have no intention of sharing intimate details of your lives -- and precious little inclination to share my own, frankly.  2) Pictures posted here will be ones without people (e.g., Bay photos) or ones with me in them. If I want to put up one with other people, I'll make an effort to ask first.  3) I will use whatever language I want. (My mom thinks I'm displaying too much of a "potty mouth.") If you don't like my word choice, um, too bad.  4) You won't see me griping about specific people here. I'd appreciate it if we all kept discussion related to the crazies to a minimum. They have Internet connections, too. :)

      So this is what 6 a.m. looks like. I had forgotten.  I went over last night for moral support, and I can report that Julie's almost all packed. I've just gotta take a quickie shower and walk Rags before heading over to start the big move out. {sniff} ... Nah, no crying today. We'll save that for tomorrow.  {yawn} I cannot believe I'm up this early. Must. Stand. Up. Now.

      Only at the Improv can you hear (in rapid succession) stand-up comedy from a Houston police officer, a "Christian comedy" single mom of four teenagers, and a linebacker-looking overweight bald guy who, five minutes before he ends his act, confesses that he's gay. We had a fabulous time tonight. If you ever have a chance to see Scott Kennedy -- run, don't walk to your friendly neighborhood comedy club.  Here's another picture of Julie and me. I really like it. She was wearing Gary's sunglasses. There are other pictures from the Improv, but I don't want to post random pictures of other people until they give their "OK." :)    urlLink

      I had forgotten the word "twitterpated." You know how you have certain expressions and words you use with your close friends, and when you don't see them so much anymore, you forget those expressions and words? Well, that happened to me. I said, "Eric, you're smitten!" But his synopsis was, "I'm so twitterpated!"  Yes, my friends, Eric's found himself a girlfriend. I've never heard him gush so much about how sweet and attractive and generally awesome a woman is. When I see (or, in this case, hear) that kind of passion inspired by finding someone special, it gives my heart great hope and makes me feel so happy (by proxy)!!   Congrats, Eric!! :-) ( urlLink see his picture here (scroll down) )  PS - Another expression I was recently reminded of having forgot is one of my favorites from my days with Jen. It was my brother who jogged my memory, by saying, "Don't snarf!" as I was laughing while drinking a Diet Pepsi at  urlLink BJ's .

      I know many people are worried that I'm upset/angry/stressed/tired/etc. (and I thank each one of you for your concern!) ... but I promise, I'm just in semi-freak-out mode because of  urlLink Julie's  imminent departure from Texas. I'm not angry at anyone, about to jump off a cliff, or trying to send subtle messages of "go away" to anyone! I'm just sad. It's happened before. {shrug} This, too, shall pass.  If you're not busy Saturday, come help us move Julie out of her apartment in north Dallas. And if you can't contribute in that manner, at least do a little "come on, cold front!" dance in our honor. :-)

      Paul and Gary both noticed today that Blogger.com ads -- aside: blogger.com was bought by Google -- are frequently similar to the content of the blog on which the ad appears. Interesting observation. I guess I've been suffering from "banner blindness," as I'd just plain never noticed.   urlLink Gary's blog , which mentions a sprinkler at Stonehenge, had an ad for sprinkler systems.  My blog, which has a general education theme at times, had something for an educational foundation for Asian girls. (Paul noticed an ad along the lines of "help fight hunger.")   urlLink Mark's blog  has an ad for presidential politics sort of things.  By contrast,  urlLink Julie's blog  has been spotted advertising mixed drink books and margarita/frozen drink mixes.   Hmmm. I think they've got us pegged. ;)

      Tonight was a  urlLink YAP  Improv night with Paula Poundstone. Before I share the inevitable Julie & Liz photo, let me just say that the $20 you spend on a ticket to see Paula here at the  urlLink Addison Improv  is worth every penny. She is a tireless performer and has a real way with a live audience. I came home with a headache ... and I'm choosing to believe it's from the laughter and not the smoke that inevitably seeps into your clothes at the Improv (but isn't so bad there that you'd leave hacking or anything).  Go. See. Paula. Her show rocks. :) {/commercial announcement}

As her "social director," I've been trying to keep Julie busy so we don't dwell on her imminent ... well. You know.  Anyway, I'm very happy with these pictures. I've just gotta figure out how to prevent the red eye problem! :)    urlLink    Paul and me after eating dinner   urlLink    I sat next to Debbie, who's been hanging out with us lately. She's awesome!   urlLink    And, of course, Gary and Julie! Aren't they adorable together??
