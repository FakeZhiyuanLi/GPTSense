      From what I have read and heard about nfsu2 it's gonna be an awesome game. for one instead of just selecting the races that u want to do u have to drive across town sometimes taking up to ten minutes going at max speed. The second thing that i have heard is that you can alter your sound system to big bigger and louder that all of the others in the race. This looks like it will be a nother awesome game and lets hope that it comes out soon.

      The Canonical List of Ways to kill Barney Collected, assembled, but not written by James Terhune.1. Make him watch his own show. 2. Make him gargle broken glass. 3. Get children-sized mannequins and fill them with razor blades. (kinda like the razored apple Halloween trick!) 4. Get him to read "The Canonical List of Blonde Jokes" to a room full of feminists. 5. Send him to Sea World to see Shamu -enough said 6. Drop him from a bridge onto the in-bound lane of the Boston Expressway. 7. Slap some antlers on his head and send him into the woods during November. 8. Move every third molecule 3 feet to the left until he closely resembles Picasso's "Guernica". 9. Nail his feet to his shoulders and use him as the Jamaican bobsled in the 1996 Winter Olympics. 10. Hollow him out and fill him with Bac-o-bits, use as Swiss Colony store display model. 11. Cryogenically freeze him, then cut out shamrock shaped pieces of his body, dye green, and use as lapel pins for St. Patrick's Day. 12. Shoot him. 13. "Barney, I would like you to meet Dr. Kevorkian...." 14. Let him be a guest on Geraldo...let the one armed, Vietnamese, lesbian, bigamist rip his arms off. 15. Donate his body to science...early. 16. Well, just call my cousins Guido and Vinnie and tell them that you kinda placed $200 in a bag under the rock in the park....mention the fact that you would _love_ to have Barney's knee-caps as conversation pieces. 17. Ask the owl in the tree, "How many layers of skin does it take to get to the middle of a Barney?" Peel off layers of skin one at a time. 18. Get him to show kids how to make and set off pipe bombs. 19. Have him magically turn the classroom into a vacuum ... watch his body explode. 20. Strip off his flesh, bury the bones in your back yard, and then dig them up, a piece at a time, selling them to your nearest natural history museum. A complete dinosaur skeleton would be worth a fortune! Death to Barney for fun AND profit! 21. Put him in Straight-Jacket (really tough & leathery). 22. Put him in one of those inflated bounce amusement park things for a year or so... 23. Prepare him as food in any number of ways (deep fried and breaded is my personal favourite) then grind up his bones for fertilizer. Sell food to an enemy. Watch enemy become Barney.  Then repeat the process as many times as you like... 24. Sew his lips to his rectum. 25. Take him into space and put him into a decaying orbit. 26. Cut him up with a dull chain-saw. 27. Toss him into a blast furnace. 28. Make him a referee in an NHL game. 29. Tell the kids of the world that Barney wants you to eat your vegetables. 30. Write a "101 Uses for a Dead Purple Dinosaur" book. 31. Make him listen to Jesse Jackson.  32. Put him in a guillotine; put the rope holding up the blade in his mouth and then beat his ass with a jagged piece of metal until he screams. 33. Put him on the Starship Enterprise. Make him go up to Worf and ask him if it's true that all Klingons are really wimps. 34. Dip him in tar (anything sticky will do), cover him with hundred-dollar bills and throw him into a pit full of lawyers... 35. Cut open his gut until the entrails lie splayed out on the floor. Don't give him a needle and thread. 36. Tie him down in the middle of the Sahara Desert and let the vultures have him. I am not sure that is a good idea because we don't need to be that cruel to the vultures. 37. Duct tape him to a street light in South Central L.A. If we are lucky, he will be shot in a drive by! 38. There is the old "Cement Overshoes", but that could be considered water pollution. 39. Make him write, "I will not be a demon sent from the lowest depths of hell" 100 times with a piece of chalk only 1/4 inch long. 40. Lob a can of Nitro-nine under his purple butt. 41. Bury all but his head in an anthill. Cover with honey. See how effective that torture method *really* is. 42. Shark bait. (Need to cut him up a little first...) 43. Let him take the place of a car crash dummy. 44. Have him clean up toxic waste/nuclear radiation sites, without environmental gear. 45. Let him have a loooong visit in the Marinaras Trench. 46. Have him stand under the space shuttle during the next launch. 47. Send him to inspect an underground nuclear test site, minutes before the next test. 48. Send him to Somalia as famine relief. 49. Target practice. 50. Send him on a candlelight tour of the Wilson Dynamite factory. 51. Pack his parachute all wrong and push him out of an airplane. Then throw the chute after him. 52.

This is your new cell-mate." 57. Send him to Miami in a rented car. 58. Lock him in a room with 10 rabid raccoons. 59. Send him on a walking tour of the La Brea Tar Pits. 60. Make him become a politician in Mexico. 61. Take him bungee jumping. Forget to secure bungee cord. 62. Poke him in the belly. With an ice pick. See if he laughs like the Pillsbury Doughboy. 63. Cast him in place of Mr. Bill on "The Mr. Bill Show" 64. Cut off his tail, and watch him fall on his face for lack of balance. 65. Send him to Loch Ness. Maybe Nessie will try to mate with him. 66. Cut off his arms and say "Where's that 'great big hug' *now*!?!" 67. Shave his fur. ALL of it. 68. The Juice Tiger. It separates the Barney pulp from the Barney juices. 69. Infiltrate the PBS stations and switch the "Barney & Friends" tapes with "Beavis 'n' Butthead" and watch the kids burn him to death. 70.

Let him visit the local jail, shove him in a cell and let the sex-starved convicts after him. 73. Use him as evidence to prove that the acceleration of gravity is 9.8 m/sec on Earth.

Teflon bullets to the skull, chest, and genitalia of the beast. 80. Throw him into a combine. 81. Bazooka blast to the cranium. 82. Nuclear Bombs. Nuff said. 83. Tie him up like a pinata and have small Mexican children beat it to death. 84. Drown him in gasoline and then set it ablaze. 85. Throw him in a vat of methylene chloride. 86. Use him for an 18 wheeler's traction. 87. Have him inspect the space shuttle's engines at T+60. 88. Put him in a cage that houses 1000 Tokay Geckoes (irony is that they're mostly purple too). 89. Have him change targets at a rifle range... without ceasing fire. 90. Put him to work at the Mt. St. Helens Close Study Station AFTER the next evacuation. 91. Use him as a test subject at the Army's Biological - Chemical - Nuclear Warfare unit. 92. Place him underneath equal quantities of iron oxide and powdered aluminum.

       Proof that Barney is related to Satan  It is a known fact (if not a sad one) that Barney is a CUTE PURPLE DINOSAUR. The bible was written in many languages, the most common being Latin (Roman). The Romans had no letter "U," and instead used "V" for printing. Therefore, CUTE PURPLE DINOSAUR becomes:  CVTE PVRPLE DINOSAVR  Take that phrase and extract the Roman numerals, and we have:  C V V L D I V  Their decimal equivalents are:  100, 5, 5, 50, 500, 1, and 5  Adding these numbers produces the single didgit 666, the number recorded in the bible as the symbol of the beast, THE NUMBER OF THE EARTH'S GREATEST EVIL! UNDENIABLE PROOF THAT BARNEY IS RELATED TO SATAN!  Given: Barney= CUTE PURPLE DINOSUAR  S  R  CUTE PURPLE DINOSAUR  Given  CVTE PVRPLE DINOSAVR  Write in Latin  CV V L DI V  Roman Numerals  100 5 5 50 500 1 5  Arabic Numerals  100+5+5+50+500+1+5  Add  666  Total  666=SATAN  Given  BARNEY=SATAN  Proven  This proves it Barney=Satan. It's a big conspiricy to get the young generation to worship satan in a plot to destroy the world!!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Could someone please tell me if the creaters of the latest GTA will be creating a complete engine for the game or will they be using the same engine just making the skins on the people different and making some of their actions different. The last thing that i wanted to know is have the creaters started creating the game yet or are they finishing off a project then starting it, if so how long will it take before they get a demo out to the greater public.

      What the hell is taking google so long to get a move on with bringing to the public their brand new e-mail. It's been weeks since they went into Beta stage and yet they still haven't brought it out to the public. Does any one have any idea when they intend to bring it out to the public.
