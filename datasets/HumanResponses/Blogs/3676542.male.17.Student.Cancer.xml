        #Episode 10-FINALE     Ok,here's the end of soap drama..  It wont have climax in my finale..  To sum up all the episode..      Life , meaning of live has never really been found out.   Though  some thought they already knew the answer.   Or  should I say, everyone has a different opinion/meaning/reasoning for wat life is..   To  me, life, something which is so special that I can't really understand it.   Why  different people got different life?   It's  a mystery..      I  appeared to be happy at all times, maybe.   But  not all times..   When  i'm thinking bout something,   I'll  look sad, but dun worry..   I  wont be sad, or even sad for long..   For  I know that I'm consider much fortunate then many in the world.   Happiness , something that everyone should have.   I  don't wish to be sad all times, even though it hurt sometime..   I  want everyone to be happy   Especially  her..   I  want to spread what ever happiness I can give to anyone i know.  Or even pple i dun really know..   Smile  always everyone..   Sun  will always rise..   Rain  will definitely go..   Autumn  came, and it's time for romance..

       #Episode 8    Stupid  school.Stupid ITE.Waste of my time.So Slacking.And the staff over there,some are suck.Say my hair long,go cut.Then write forms.Idiot.Give me money cut hair then i go.I cut my hair two weeks ago only.Cut again.So rich ah.  Some  more say wat,dare to wear uniform to go out walk or not(to the class).Then what hair long like mop.Say poly nv care,then so many mop hair.INsulting pple.Later kanna beat.Say wat Cut short,go orchard then look better.Shit him.Like the staff ah,then we can don't call this 21st century.  He  got cocked eye also,my hair aint touching collar say wat will touch collar soon.Of cos lah,then wait till it touches then cut lah.WHAT ITE represent "Into The Excellence".Buzz him off ah.Since when the phrase english became so weird.Pple Usually is  "Towards Excellence".In to Excellence/Into the excellence,the phrase already sounds weird.By the way,ITE stands for Institution of Technical Education.What into excellence. -.-'  IT's THE END  still sounds better.  IT's THE END of SCHOOL LIFE..  He didnt even check those year 2.Unfair.year 2 still got long plus dyed.The staff can go bang himself into the wall.  I wanna get out of the school  As soon As POSSIBLE   singapore pledge,no no no,is the  whole world ,say wat equality. there's isn't real equality practiced here. People go poly wear home clothes,JC and ITE wear uniform. So where's the equality practices? Why is there a different in standard of teaching though people's pace of studying is different Why do country have different economic status.Why can the world world be the same? Eg,price of a drink is different at different place.Not equal.  Conclusion, HUMAN CAN NV PRACTISE REAL EQUALITY EQUALITY STILL HAVE IT'S RESTRICTION  FEELING OF TODAY: ANGRY  today morning wake up the very first feeling i got is that i missed her very much. She just appear in my mind immediately i woke up Oso the feeling of losing her haha.Suddenly feel like this.weird.

       #Episode 7    Everyday  in sch,it's really a waste of my time.Slacking all the way from morning till afternoon. Olvl coming soon.feeling nervous and scare of it now.. Hope the "obstacle" will end sooner...   Birthday  coming soon..  It's  fast that another year has gone by...  Blink  of eye..  Wish  i could go back to the last year  BAck  to the past.    回到过去     一盏黄黄旧旧的灯 时间在旁闷不吭声 寂寞下手毫无分寸 不懂得轻重之分 沉默支撑跃过陌生 静静看着凌晨黄昏 你的身影 失去平衡 慢慢下沉 黑暗已在空中盘旋 该往哪我看不见  也许爱在梦的另一端 无法存活在真实的空间 想回到过去 试着抱你在怀里 羞怯的脸带有一点稚气 想看你的看的世界 想在你梦的画面 只要靠在一起就能感跆鹈?想回到过去 试着让故事继续 至少不再让你离我而去 分散时间的注意 这次会抱得更紧 这样挽留不知还来不来得及 想回到过去  思绪不断阻挡着回忆播放 盲目的追寻仍然空空荡荡  灰蒙蒙的夜晚睡意又不知躲到哪去 一转身孤单已躺在身旁

        #Episode 3     Today ,after having tution,went to help ah gong do work(umbrella logo printing)..Tiring..This work,says it easy,it isn't.Says it's hard,can not be.Required skill and experience..I started helping since i'm primary sch.not sure primary wat.either 3 or 4.haha.  Well ,this job earn not much.Each print of umbrella,only bout few cents.Got to print a large quantites to earn more.Problem is time contraint,and not enough labour.This is quite a labour intensive work.Cos no machines are you.Or got,but should say it's tool.From unpackaging,to printing,to drying,to packaging,all done manaually..It's a hard work..Not many pple know how the logo is printed.Not by machines,do mananually using tools..Hard work eh..  Considering  that this job earn very little,my aunt still give me quite alot for doing the job.Take the money,mother sure give me a nagging session,say my aunt they all earn not much,den give me can consider alot..Not i want de oso.my aunt keep pushing the money and ask me keep.  Today  a bit careless,cut hand with a penknife when unpackaging..nvm,unlucky,I used to it.Since younger.Wat to do,born to be a unlucky person.    As  I was walking home from interchange,I used the time to think of her,infact,I'm still thinking of her.Miss her especially during the nite,before I fell asleep.It gets so lonely..She just keep appearing in my mind..Can't help it to think of her.  I  hate the feeling of missing her,hate the feeling when seeing her and him being so intimately infront of me,hate being lonely thru the nite.  I  hate her,hate her for letting me loving her so deeply.   Did  I love the wrong person?  Am  I stupid for single-sided love everytime  Should  I get in between them or Should I give up and sliently wish them all the best?  No  need guess the answer,I always choose latter.  But  for now,i dunno the answer,I love her too deeply.  Why  I'm always the fool.  Fool again (Westlife)    Song of the day      CoCo Lee_-_愛你在每一天      心的最里面 每個夢里也是這畫面 唯一的眷戀 就是和你 每次交會那瞬間 多愛我一點 因為我有同樣的感覺 同樣的信念 我的天空 你抬頭就看的見  感動一點一點 种滿心底花園 愛你的每一天 讓我勇敢向前 感情沒有條件 真心才能永遠 愛你在每一天 這句話永不變 感動裝滿心田 未來路途遙遠 愛你在每一天 我真心永不變

        #Episode 2     Found  wat I truely like to do,music.Playing piano. Or should I say keyboard piano.haha.Don't have a piano. Well,it's fun to play,lots of tune to play with. Though I'm not very sure how to read the notes(beansprout),but i figure out how to play Jay zhou's An Jing.Cool..hadn't learn finish.quite difficult cos I didn't learn piano before.haha.Quite proud(bhb) right?haha..nvm wat you think.As long as i'm happy.   Music ,a great way to express one's feeling The inner emotion of one whichis usually difficult to describe Music,make it more simple to explain The feeling that one will get from a piece of music Maybe different from anothers' feeling But the meaning of the music,represent each and everyone's story A story of life,experience.   For  me,different music or songs represent each and every story i have.Think it's oso the same for many pple out there.Sometimes,I was wondering,is the song specially composed for me?haha.the lyric of the song,just like my situation from time to time.Mostly love song,woah,incredible,really like writing out my story,my life.Exactly the same situation.Mayb the composer have the same situation as me huh?haha.   As  I've said,Life is like a drama Every drama has its own theme song Drama and song,(life and story and another word) Both are connected in some way or the other You can't have a life,without a theme song And of cos,you can have the theme song,without having a life when it reach the climax of the drama,the song would oso reach its climax.    My story    My   drama climax(knowing you) My theme song (Boyfriend-5566) Sub theme song (Alot like Simple love(jay),tiao bo(5566),etc.)   Born on 21st july 1987,Cancerian,Rabbit Growing up with many obstacles   Firstly -Operation at young age(less then 5 or 4 years old) Had a unhappy childhood day which i dun remember,mayb a shot period of time only.   Reach  the age of schooling.like drawing when i'm in kindergarden.Always draw a house and a tree(dunno why)   Primary  1 sch days,crying when go to sch.nv had the problem in kindergarden.Think i dun like the sch.Time to go sch,yet I didn't wake my mom up and bring me to sch.Got scolded by parent.   Changed  sch,primary 2-6.First day of new sch,saw a girl,heart keep pounding,love a first sight or like at first sight.but didn't get to know the girl much.That's when i start to know what love/like.But not very sure the meaning then. Primary three,fall in love with another "Girl 1".or should say like bah.My sis told me I got shout I love you under the block of the girl house,which I don't remember.Haha.like "Girl 1" bout 2year plus.   Primary  5,class had changed,new classmate,like "girl 2" when i slowly knew her(btw i'm not flirt,is after give up hope for the "Girl 1" then like).I always dun have the courage to tell the girl whom I like that I like her.But for "Girl 2",think I did tell,but think she nv give me chance.Had a some sort of test,about "Girl 2",what she like..etc.with few other guy.I lost,the guy who won got tip from the "girl 2's" friend."Girl 2" and the guy started a relationship.Even heard she and the guy going to kiss,my heart started to break.But it doesnt hurt so much at that time,think i'm not really like the girl.   Primary  6,very close with a "Girl 3".Talks on phone almost everyday and chat very long not 2-3hr,up to 10 hour oso have.dunno talk bout wat also.haha.Den heard from "Girl 3" that her pal/"sister"(Girl 4) like me,and "Girl 4" herself oso got say,but I dun like the her,cos like to beat pple and not the type of girl I'm searching for.Many things happened that year.   PSLE  over,new school again,got a very bad score,and enter express class with merely a point or two.   During  orientation before Sec sch start,saw a girl(girl A).She's really look pretty,can't keep my eyes off her.love at first sight.But I was think i wont know her cos the sch quite big and i dun usually make alot of fren,not even in primary sch day.Den SYF brought us "together".This is fate,I was so happy.But i dun dare to talk to her.At that time,pple know my nick as mimiyan and I became some sort popular at that time.then she knew me.And we started to talk.and became fren.I was hope to be her partner,but I always have little confident in myself,say it's impossible.we became quite a good fren.I found that i love her more and more.heard from pple that she oso like me,but when ask her,she like dun want answer.But oso heard that she quite flirt.I'm hurt to hear that.   Sec 2 ,I knew other girl(girl B),which oso partly becos my nick had already spread till dunno where liao.When I look at her,and the look and smile that she give me,i simply just sort of wanting to know more bout the girl.But at that time i'm love "Girl A".  But  i give up on "Girl A" knowing that she like keep playing with pple's heart.Dunno since when,I knew the "Girl B".We got chat on the phone for a short period of time,and i slowly fall for her.Yet I also no chance..And she found herself a bf not long after we knew each other.I silently wishing her all the best. 默默的祝福    Dunno  since when,I knew "Girl C" think is end of sec 1.Not very close with her.Only sometimes msg and seldom talk to her in sch tot.Only till last year,or end of sec 3,we started to talk more and more.Very close..And dunno since when I fall in love with her.Very deeply in love with her.But I know,this time round is impossible,really impossible.She had bf already.And their relationship very long..I dun want to be the third party,dun wanna break her and her bf apart.Dun wanna  挑撥(tiao bo)  their relation.This time round,I know truely.I love the girl,from the deepest of my heart,I want her to be happy,and I know she love her bf deeply,so i dun wanna hurt hurt by snatch her from her bf,and I know i dun have the courage and the quality/good point to woo and have her with me.I treasure the times being with her,every hr,every minute,every second,every milisecond.Being with her,would be the most wonderful days of my life.Watching her smile,makes me happy too..:) She's is the one i've been searching for,I know for now.Forever,I can make the promise,Cos i dunno the meaning of forever.I only know now,and now my heart beats   for you   And only   for you  ..    I have reach the climax of my 17years of story.And the climax start with "Girl C"      Song of the day      5566_-_Boyfriend       I'm sorry for me buggin' you   Sorry for being such a fool   God knows I've tried but I can't let go  I'm crazy 'bout you know who  I'm sorry for me needing you  Sorry girl that you don't feel it too   I get the point, should be a man about it  I've never been good at that - no no  Forgive me for being me   I've tried to let go     Chorus:    I know you got a boyfriend-another man  Another guy by your side   Someone who hopefully treats you right   But you don't know how much I wish That I was   Your boyfriend - that other guy   The only one who's allowed   In your room to lay in your arms at night  now you don't know how much I wishThat I was your boyfriend  I'm sorry for me wanting you   Sorry for not playing by the rules  But what would you do if you were in my shoes  Feeling lost and blue Mnn   I'm sorry for me lovin' you  sorry for being such a fool   God knows I've tried but I can't let go  I'm crazy 'bout you know who     Chorus:    Another man is by your side   I hope he treats you right   I wish I was the only one   To lay in your arms at night  Well you can't blame a guy for tryin'   Now what else can I do  And how I wish that my prayers, Thoughts and dreams   Would become reality

       From the millions of people in Singapore Thousands gathered along theatre by the bay(ESPLANADE) Some waiting in the rooms of THE ORIENTAL hotel Waiting for the moment the short moment of display in the sky to come..  A group of us (Stan, Daniel, Boon and me) Find ourself a place A place that will have a great view of the wonderful display..  YESH!the time came. It came without notice The banging sound of the explosive chemicals Brings along the cheering of the crowds Up above, the spectacular colour in the dark sky.. One after another Turning a dull, plain sky Into a fabulous,marvellous Fireworks painting..  I could say,the finale isn't at the end. It's the part where the fireworks *BANGS* nonstop for bout 30sec or so.. that's the nices part of the event.. I could stop wow-ing when the wonderful sparkles last for so long.. Each bangs,came along with cheering and wow-ing from me and of cos the crowd..  The Fujifilm S5000 digicam of boons' is damn clear. Why? Imagine stand along the bay of the theatre Taking a shot of THE ORIENTAL. You got still see the people inside, and what's their clothing.. We spotted one red pants,two couple having dinner.. :P I bet boon have been doing some PI(private investigator) work.. Be careful everyone..haha ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ok, we stayed at the bay for sometime Had burger before we went to meet kim leong at the lau pak sak(the burger was nice) Our first suggestion is to take MRT yet Dan say walk.. We walk bout 30+ min den reach the Market. Took a wrong route to raffles..due to some of my mistake, and some of Dan's mistake and some of Boon's mistake. Why Stan no mistake?He was not leading us or guiding us..he just followed.. Ok,let's not blame any one for "Who's fault is it?"
