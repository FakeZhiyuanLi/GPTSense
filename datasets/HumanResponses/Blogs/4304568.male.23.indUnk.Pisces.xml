      I sat my English oral examination this afternoon. Reality struck me really hard. It was the real thing! O levels is happening right before me! I met someone who was once form church at the exams and told Yushan about her. Man...the way how she "bio" me...eeek...but anyway the oral went well.  I was really happy today. Yushan and I went to look for more stuff and more ideas flooded us. It was really funny. We were busy observing nonsense and laughing at some things on the way. Then I received an SMS from Daphne about our friend. We got so worried. We knew we got to rush and do something to see if she's ok. I have many friends and there are 5 girls whom I got to know this year that I really cherish and treat them as my little "grand-daughters". Yushan, Daphne, Peizi, Annabel and Alicia. One of them looked very down today. As a "grand-father" and a "body guard", I was very concerned. I wished I could help but I guess I didn't really do much.  Sista, when you see this, I really wish you are ok and that you can smile again. Your emotions flowed into mine and I really feel for you. Must get well ok? God will heal you from the inside. There's a song by "Firehouse", it's a rock band, called "Here For You". I really dedicate this number to you.  I learnt something while I was crossing the bridge on my way home. I realised that friends who really stick by in the hardest moments are those that will etch their names in many hearts. I wish I can qualify to be such a friend. I'm happy that oral was good, but sad to see my sista feeling down. We love you and care for you.  Ok folks! That's all for today. Let me leave you a thought...since now it's the 7th month...if suay suah you died, would you die feeling fulfilled or empty?  Selah

      This morning I woke up with a fresh thought in my mind. I saw the sun rising up from the dusk of the earth. A thought filled my freshly awakened mind...God is faithful and he shows it through his creations. Have you wondered how the sun rises faithfully every morning and how the stars shine in the night sky?  Well, I was just preparing for a new day and this thought just filled my mind. I hope that you will be inspired to start the day with a fresh purpose just like I am and I wish to share this with you all. Cheers!

      Hello folks! Today was a very eventful day for me. I went to school and the corridor was smelling crap! At first, we thought it was some dead rat or something but it was just paint. IT REALLY STINKS! Nicholas was spraying air-freshner all over that our shirts were smelling of it as well! What a morning!  We has S.S after lunch and man, everyone was so sleepy. This was the first time I almost fell asleep in class but had to force myself to stay awake and catch whatever I can! Yushan and I went to shop for stuff for "Teachers' Day". She bought something while I short-listed many stuff. We had fun telling stories and observing weird people. I realised something. Yushan is very detailed about the type of gifts that she wants to give people. Man, if she were to make you something, you should look at the EFFORT! She's really amazing!  In the evening, I gave Superman lessons. He was funny as usual, but yet progressing well, WELL DONE SUPERMAN! Superwoman should give him a sweet or something. He is really funny lah. He said I didn't teach him a certain stuff, but he ended up playing it, so, I GOT TEACH OR NOT?!?! HAHAHA!  Well, whether the day was good or not, I thank God for it. Everyday has a message behind it. It's a matter of how you receive it and how you digest upon it. Today, I had the opportunity to learn about different personalities and it was a wonderful experience. I pray that everyday will be enlightening in all ways.

      Today I had the honor to watch Mr Dudu Fisher sing. He's a cool dude. He's an extraordinary tenor with a great voice and the special thing is he is Jewish. We love the jews!  Before I went for the concert, I was facing a dilemma...what to wear...stupid for a man to come into such a situation. I couldn't believe it. It was as if I was in some beauty pageant. I felt like a gay. I tried on 3 different shirts, matching them with 3 different pants. It took me 20 mins to decide. I finally went for the good old black pants and white collared shirt.  I meet "chian pan zi" and we took a cab down to church and met Daphne and the rest of the gals. Alvin was with us too. Man, I truly cherish him. We had a quick meal and went into the auditorium. It was amazing to see so many VIPs and celebraties. Everyone was looking so sharp. Some of the geeks that I know looked nice too, including me. ARGH! I HATE FORMAL!  Dudu's voice was awesome. When he sang the slow tunes, my limited hair stood. I was just amazed! He shared about Israel and many stories about how Israel overcame tough situations. I learnt and saw the favour of God upon Israel. At that moment, I wanted so much to go to Israel.  After the show we took many pics and had a great time laughing at Monkey and her best friend. I conclude...beautiful girls are insane! They can talk about twerb throughout the entire taxi ride home while trying to deal with her hiccups. GILA! More than that, they got some weird theories behind the reason why men talk to women...duh...we are innocent most of the time lah! Another thing that really amazed me was that Monkey ain't that insane after all.  Well, today was eventful. The concert, the journey and the wonders of women in a cab...even "chian pan zi" was lost.  There goes the flying cockroach!  The crapology of good crapping is crapping with a sense of crap that craps you out of your crap.

      Hi friends,  Just a thought for the day. How do you start your day? With an abrupt phone call? Waking up from a good or a bad sleep or dream? Well many people thinks that its small stuff like tat which determines your day.  I have been having a bad run of sleeps, but it seems that my days are still ok. I guess its a game of your mind and body being unable to compromise. The art of self-control and mental strength plays a role in this, in my opinion. As there are many factors to a bad day, the best thing to do is, be simple, think positive and smile!  That hi-watt smile of yours can lighten up the atmosphere and make your day a worth-while one. Thats if for now as I am still in the midst of testing out this blog. (hand sign)  CHEERS!!!  The crapology of good crapping is crapping with a sense of crap that craps you out of your crap.
