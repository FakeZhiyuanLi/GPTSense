      He jerked his overweight SUV in and out of traffic like a top, the vehicle straining against the centrifugal force from the abrupt moves.  It was another one of those mornings, why couldn’t that bitch just shut up?  He reflexively reached to his top left pocket for his smokes which was about the only pleasure he had left in life, and then realized for the third time in the ten minutes he had been careening down the highway that he smoked his last one in the kitchen, thrusting it in the air to accentuate his point, he had to get his point across, because God knows if he didn’t beat it into her head she wouldn’t understand a damn thing.  Why did he have to do everything?  And, as usual, she just stood there, head bent in submission as if he was going to hit her, he never had so why did she do that, but sometimes he got close, so close, so those times he usually punched something else, although since the last time he broke his hand he was trying really hard not to do that anymore.  But today he did put his cigarette out in the middle of the kitchen with that godforsaken tablecloth that cost him $100 of his hard earned money.  What the hell was that woman thinking?  A honk brought him back to the present, temporarily out of his rage.  The honk appeared again, more insistent this time, and he realized that the light had changed to green and he didn’t notice.  With an explicative, he punched the gas as the horn went even again.  “You do NOT want to mess with ME today!”, he yelled towards the rear at the green Japmobile he saw through the rear window as his vehicle lurched through the stoplight as it was turning yellow.  A slight smile crossed his lips.  “That’s what you get for honking at me”, he thought, but the smile quickly changed to a frown as he saw his nemesis glide nonchalantly through the red light.  “You’re an idiot”,. he yelled again into the rear mirror this time, noticing in his peripheral vision that everyone ahead of him had stopped, and if he didn’t react real soon, he was going to take a number of them out.  In a panic, he overreacted and slammed on the brakes much harder than necessary which caused his tires to lock and cause a real ruckus and all of his stuff in the front seat to fly onto the floorboard.  “S_________!”, he yelled as he instinctively reached out to catch something before it was all scattered in the vehicle.  “S_________, s__________, s_________”, leaning over and realizing that due to the size of his vehicle and the size of his paunch there was no way he was not going to be able to reach anything until he stopped, and he was not stopping before he got to work.  He leaned his head back, closed his eyes, and took a deep long breath.  When was it going to end?  “Hey mister!”  As he tried to remember how many breaths his relaxation tapes at home told him to take to calm down, he heard it again.  “Hey you, fat boy!”  He slowly opened his eyes as he let out a long breath, and began to scan from right to left as much of his surroundings as he could from his high perch.  As he finally looked out of his left window, he saw the same green Japmobile immediately to his left, and he saw a very scrawny and very young red head with a white freckled face looking up at him from the passenger side of the green car.  “What did you learn to drive, you fat asshole?”  He did not immediately reply, the situation was too surreal for his brain to register right away.  Was she really talking to him?  “Yeah, I was talking to you, you porker.  What the hell is your problem.”  her small mouth with very red lipstick said.  And then it hit him, a sudden burning sensation encompassed his brain like a flash fire, and almost involuntarily he ripped his seatbelt off his generous girth and opened the door to get out.  The girls head immediately popped back into the green car, and frantically began to crank the window up.  He had lost control, and there was nothing he could do now but finish what he had started.  As he stepped down, he felt a pop in the left side of his head, and then he felt himself falling like he stepped on a sheet of thin wet ice.  He never felt himself hit the pavement.

      He found if he sat at a bit of an angle, the dull ache in his right side disappeared, if he did not turn his head too far to the right.  This made it a bit harder to maneuver his car to the left lane, so for the past week, instead of moving his car to and fro to take advantage of openings in the walls of traffic he faced every morning, he maintained his position in the right lane and dealt with the happenings in that lane without complaint.  His also had to remember not to breathe too deeply, because that brought a sharper version of the pain and also in some circumstances developed into a coughing fit, which of course made the pain even sharper.  He finally made the call last Thursday from his office during his lunch hour after avoiding it for the past three months.  It was just another day at the office, and during his lunchtime ritual he picked up the phone and made the call, just like that, like he was ordering out for pizza.  His heart was hammering as he made the call and was nonspecific in why he was making an appointment.  After he hung up, he felt relief and a bit more positive, which allowed him to have a little hope.  He has had pains similar to this throughout his adult life, especially during more stressful periods where he smoked more cigarettes than usual.  He had not been to the doctors in over ten years, and then it was only for an ingrown toenail that had become so infected that he dared not attempt to perform the grisly operation himself, so he succumbed to the inevitable shot in the big toe and the rest.  When the doctor recommended blood tests and the like since he was pushing forty at the time, he agreed but did not keep any of the appointments and it was all conveniently forgotten.  One of the advantages of managed care was that the doctors were so busy they did not have the time to track down wayward patients who were not interested in following up medical procedures.  But this pained scared him.  He first noticed it three months ago when mowing the yard,  one of his typical Saturday morning chores.  At his age he was accustomed to aches and pains, they were a constant reminder of how old he was getting and how everything now was harder.  But unlike all of the other minor irritations, this one did not get any better.  At first it only reared its head during exertion, but soon was a constant companion.  He began to get worried – had the 30 years of smoking finally caught up with him?  He couldn’t tell his wife – she had been ragging on him to quit smoking for years, and he could not face the disappointment in her eyes if he told her of his condition.  He had been facing it on his own.  He was not ready for major medical issues, for the inevitable decline, for death.  He had so many people counting on him.

      The blare of the horn caused her to jump in her seat.  It took her a second or two to realize that she was sitting at a light that had turned green and there were no vehicles in front of her.  She awkwardly moved her foot quickly from the brake to the gas, causing her vehicle to lurch through the intersection.  God, her head hurt so much.  It took all she had just to get out of the house this morning, practically putting on her blouse as she walked out of the door.  Thank God that Brad had to leave the house for work before she had to get up, she hated how he looked at her after a long night in the bar.  She certainly hoped she wasn’t late again, hasn’t she’d been late a couple of times this week already?  At the next light she glanced in the mirror and didn’t like what she saw.  When did she get so old?  She promised herself last night that she was going to have just a couple of drinks and hang with Jessica, a familiar sight at the local watering hole.  And then, one thing led to another, and after running up a $70 bar tab it was last call.  She did deserve her time to relax because, God knows, the last five years of her life have been a struggle, with every time she turned around there was another crisis to deal with.  Brad just couldn’t seem to hold a job – something always seemed to happen and it was never his fault, or so he said, so there were many periods the past few years she had to work in her family’s deli at night just to make ends meet.  Her mother’s long illness and welcome death was an emotionally draining experience, and then after months of feeling exhausted finally going to the doctor’s and finding out that she had lupus.  How much was a person supposed to deal with?  It used to only be the Friday afternoon happy hours, it was such a treat to go out with her work friends for a couple of drinks after the long work week, not having to go home to the tension and pressure of Brad and his difficulties, not having to see their home, once the basis for all their dreams but now looking worn and tatty from benign neglect.  Everything at home was so hard, but everything out was so easy.  Everyone was everyone’s best friend, and she found she felt relaxed and comfortable with herself for the first time in years.  For the first time in what seemed like forever, she was enjoying herself.  But the happy hours turned to “happy” nights, and then to “happy” weekends, and now she was going out during the week.  She tried to go home, but after dinner she always began to feel restless and frustrated, and looked for excuses to leave the house.  Brad never said anything when she said she was “popping out to the store” as he sat in his chair glued to the television watching some crap on the WB.  She felt so relieved walking out the front door.  She loved the smell of the bar, the bright neon advertisements drawing her in, and the always friendly bartenders a welcome sight from the drudgery of home.  How could she stay home when this was out there?  She quickly applied some makeup at the next light trying to make herself look presentable.  It was hard with her head feeling so fuzzy.  Tonight, she would stay home, or if she went out, she would only have a couple.  She was so tired of dealing with this in the morning.
