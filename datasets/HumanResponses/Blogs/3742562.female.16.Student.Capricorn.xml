      Whoo...I finally get some time to myself....last night I played MONOPOLY with my dad and sister...no one ever wants to play with me, but they did for some reason...I whooped em!...I called Brandon after but he had turned his cell off...stupid...this morning my dad thought he was gonna be all big and bad and wake me up by throwing water all over me...I got pissed...and he went downstairs to brag to my mom...just like a lil kid...idiot...grr...I'm so mad at him...and then the dummy not only throws the water on me...but all in my ear...I felt like I had been scubadiving and a 1,000 gallons of water had floated into my head...GRRR....anyways...then I had to help clean with the cleaning lady...I mean, isn't she getting paid to clean the house by HERSELF...and we have to clean our rooms before she comes, HELLO?! What is she getting paid for?!...anyways...then I went take a 4 hour nap on the living room floor...listening to my dad bitch about how lazy we are...but OH NO...when it comes time to clean...he's nowhere in sight...my mom and I just got done looking and charms for these bracelets we got...I got a bunch of cute ones...woohoo...now I'm just blow drying and straightening my hair...yet another day in the interesting life of *bRiTbRo*

      One word to describe my life....((boredom))...last night I went to bed early...(11)...I didn't feel good...so I thought I was gonna get up early...but n0o0...I got up at 2 am and watched some movie to 4 am...so I still got up late...grr...oh well...all day I did absolutly nothing...the house was quiet cause Lauren was gone most of the day...and mom had one of her little surgeries (only 2 more)...so she was in bed all day...so all day I did absolutly nothing...chatted...but no one was hardly on...and read the new SEVENTEEN magazine...Brandon called me, then got a beep and went eat...and called back later and wasn't feeling good so he went to bed early...and mom went to bed early...and only stupid stuff is on tv...besides the COSBY SHOW...anyways...I'm bored...humprff....

      Okay...it's dark and gross outside...and I'm really bored, and I discovered this blog thingy...so I decided...what the hell, why not? Okay, for as much stuff as this thing is supposed to let you do...why are there so little buttons? Hmm...missing buttons...I'll figure this out eventually...if I keep this up...maybe it's a one time thing...I'll decide on that later...

I woke up a little early this morning (11:30)&nbsp;cause my dog woke me up...when I woke up they had a  package  on my bed...it was my  shoes ! They're not everything I'd thought they'd be...but they are  *  cute  * ... &nbsp;&nbsp; Didn't do much after I got up, started my laundry, bathed, cleaned my room...speaking of laundry...I need to get the last load out of the dryer...haha...whoopsies &nbsp;&nbsp; Me and Brandon were  supposed  to go eat out tonight,&nbsp; but he changed his mind and we're gonna go tomorrow night and then go the mall for a bit and head back to his house. I was a little pissed and I don't know why... I really don't want to go at all ...he thinks he's gonna pay for half of my purse...I can only imagine what his parents must think about that...grr...I'm just so aggravated with the whole situation... &nbsp;&nbsp; I signed up for this penpal thing on the net...I've been getting e-mail's...hopefully I'll find one I really like and make a great new friend...considering how many I have here...I need to move...

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Grr...everyone is  pissing  me off! ...everytime I go downstairs someone's either arguing already or are trying to start one with me...so..my  solution  ...   STAY IN MY ROOM!    &nbsp;&nbsp; Today me &amp;&nbsp; dad went shopping at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Best Buy, and Academy...I got me this new thing that holds videotaps &amp; DVD's that matches my CD holder one...it's pretty neat...I got some new  urlLink shoes  and my  urlLink pants  for school...now I'm just waiting on a  urlLink schoolbag  and a  urlLink belt  and the other junk we need for that hell hole...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dad's leaving for offshore tomorrow for a couple of months &amp; I'm stuck here with Sass Mouth &amp; Pissy Pants...oh boy, shouldn't this be  fun!  Today we got the tour of "hurricane season" from dad...and mom is  convinced  that everything isn't gonna work out so she's causing shit about that...she was saying "Ya'll are just kids, ya'll don't know everything..." ...so if we are too imcompetent to do that she can get her broken self and do it herself...idiot.  &nbsp;&nbsp; Since we have to drop Dad off at the New Orleans Airport we were going to go to the Museum of Art with my free passes, but N00o0o0...he got an earlier flight so now we can't go...Mom's like, we're gonna go...yeah right, if it was up to her, we'd never get there...grrr  &nbsp;&nbsp; And friends?

      Sunday I went to the  Cajun Bahamas  with  Jen ...can you believe I actually went in?! It was so much fun! We put our legs through the arm holes in our lifejackets and were walkin around like they were  diapers ...haha. I got me a lil tan! We came back to her house and prank called like 30 people. It was hilarious. I met this new kid that's coming to our school from Patterson, his name's Josh. Come to find out that night that the same place where we went in the boat to guys died. They were supposedly playing chicken in boats and one got charged with a DWI, two girls are in the hospital, but should be okay. The next day, after getting about 2 hours of sleep, cause everyone kept calling my cell all night. We got 3 wake-up calls at like  6 30 in the morning ...we were at the Honda place for 7 30 to get Jen's car fixed after getting us some hashbrowns! We waited for 2  hours  and then they tell us that they don't have the right part! OMG! We were so  mad ! Then we went to school to get Jen's schedule changed and they conncelor's were in a meeting so we went to her aunt's house where her sis was babysitting and took a nap...and  overslept  and jumped in the car half asleep barely being able to stand up. Then we went to school and waited for the football players to get out of practice...I fell asleep in the car, and got woken up by 7 of them jumping on me and all over the car. What a  wonderful  way to wake up...right. Then they were taking too long and we brought Joey to Dularge, came back to my house and grubbed. Then we went to the ortho for Jen, and went back to school to change her schedule. Then we brought Chelsea Falcon home. JOY. Then we went to Jen's house got some money out the change bottle thing and went get a snowball with our loose change. YUM! Then we went fill up her tank with nothing but  quarters, dimes, and nickels ...DICKLES! It was sooo funny! Then we went back to her house and chilled. Went get her sis at her aunt's, and they dropped me off cause they had swim practice. What a adventurous day! HAHAHA. Today...I did...absolutly...nothing....except laundry....WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

What's wrong with them people?! It was so  awesome ! I loved it! I could have stayed there longer...but we only stayed for 2 hours cause my Lauren was hungry and kept complaining the whole time...but damn, them people are talented...they had freakin Picaso in there! How awesome is that?!      Then we went shopping, after getting lost again for a bit...haha...I got's me a sweater, wallet, make-up bag, belt, and earrings. They're so cute. OMG! And they have this perfume called Brit, and ahhh! It smells so GOOD! I'm saving my money and getting it! I HAVE TO! It's just SO good! hahaha...

           OmG... WaLmArT ?  HoUmA ?  MuRdEr ?!  Who would believe that ?! Certainly not me before today! I was gonna be there! Thank  God  I wasn't! I'd never want to have witnessed something like that! Okay...some guy killed his girl by shooting her like 3 times in the head! Then goes to some chinky hotel! And guess what else...I went to Brandon's and we went visit his grandma who happens to live like next door to that same chinky hotel...I HAVE  BAD  LUCK! This is so freaky!      Well...besides all that, I didn't do anything today. Just sat around being lazy. Woke up late...watched  Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights ...which is like an AWESOME movie! Then I went downstairs, got my new pants in...these actually stay up...but the pant legs are so wide and the crotch is still a little long so I stuck them in the washer/dryer to make them shrink...they fit a little better now, the legs are still wide...but hey, they're comfy...then I ate some  Dominoes ...mmm pizza...then I went to my baby's house...that's it...WHOO-WHOO!...haha
