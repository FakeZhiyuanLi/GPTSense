        urlLink    A U.S. marine standing on his military vehicle drives past a portrait of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in Safwan, southern Iraq.&nbsp; urlLink      Is the policy of pre-emption right or not. Well pre-emption is a policy which has been practiced by the US since many years now but still it isn't a safe place, 9/11 clearly throws light on the sought of threats that the American people face. Pre-emption can be productive if exercised with caution unlike what Mr.Bush wants to do, bomb anyone who doesn't agree with you. I am afraid the way Bush administration has been handling this doctrine it has led to the loss of credibility of the US and her allies. Just because you have military might doesn't necessarily mean that you are safe or invincible. But it does mean that you can always prevent an attack from taking place. What US needs at the moment is a strong intelligence network and help from all powerful nations. If Afghanistan and Iraq can become a model of democracy for the Arab world then it will surely help the US tremendously in the global fight against terror. But as things stand at the moment it looks highly unlikely that Iraq would be able to become that sought of a role model for its neighbors, so the world can pin its hopes to Afghanistan which might just put it off. As of now the policy of pre-emption has failed to impress more people then the number whom it has impressed.

        urlLink    An Iraqi throws a stone at a burning vehicle as others search the debris of a building at the scene of a car bomb in Baghdad. &nbsp; urlLink      Iraq is burning and nobody seems to care. Many in the western world thought that the mere removal of Saddam Hussain will make Iraq more prosperous or at least it will help Iraq to come on to the track of progress. That has not happened so. The main premise on which this war was fought has turned out to be a blatant lie there are no WMD'S in Iraq. This lie has not only affected the credibility of the coalition countries but has tarnished the image of CIA. For which George Tenet had to pay the price just a few days back by resigning. Car bombings and targeted killings of senior Iraqi government officials has become a thing of routine. American forces have compromised with radicals like Al-Sadr because the American generals on the battlefield are well aware of the harm an uprising in Najaf and adjoining areas would cause to the handover of sovereignty at the end of this month. The future looks gloomy but hope is still there at least, George Bush facing an election soon would like for the American people to think so.                               How the Iraqi story shapes up will not only determine the fate of the American president but will also dictate the future of the middle-east.

        urlLink    Evil gets Hell&nbsp; urlLink      Saudi Arabia is the holiest place for all Muslims in this world. Two of the most sacred sites Mecca and Madina are the main attraction for Muslim pilgrims. But sadly, today Saudi Arabia is also turning out to be one of the most dangerous places to visit especially if you are a westerner. The reign of terror started when American troops established a base in Saudi Arabia while fighting Saddam Hussain in the 1991 Gulf war. And it has continued ever since. The groups affiliated to Al Qaida who are active in the Saudi kingdom have only one aim to topple the incumbent regime and to make Saudi Arabia a haven for all kinds of terror related activities.              Who is to blame in all this you make ask. The answer is not too long; the Saudi Royal family. They encouraged, financed and helped these terrorist outfits. The CIA and MI5 knew this, America never asked them to stop it because at that time these groups were not primarily anti-American. Now that fate has turned the full circle the Saudi Royal family is in danger of losing control over their kingdom. It wouldn't be unfair to say that you reap what you sow.

        urlLink    A mushroom cloud rises over Nagasaki on august 9, 1945. This photo is signed by Maj. Charles Sweeney, the pilot of the B-29 bomber that dropped the bomb.&nbsp; urlLink      It started when two major world powers competed for national glory and today it has brought us to a point in time where everything is uncertain. The race for nuclear weapons is on a fast track. Ten years back no one could have imagined that there can be any possibility of someone detonating a nuke in an urban area which has a high density of population. But today it is an event governments all over the world are preparing for. Recently a web of nuclear proliferation was uncovered when the Father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb was caught red handed trying to sell highly sensitive information pertaining to nuclear weapons to Osama Bin Laden and his friends. The way to prevent a tragedy from taking place is to take rouge nations like North Korea, Pakistan, Iran and Libya to task. The civilized world must stand together in this fight for humanity.

        urlLink                           Reality Bites &nbsp; urlLink      The problem about most powerful Presidents is that they always tend to forget about the enemies within and try to search for foes abroad. The exact thing has taken place in terms of Mr.Bush and the Iraq conflict. The first mistake he made was to rely on neo-cons like Dick Cheney. The second mistake was committed when he relied on the faulty intelligence provided by the CIA. And the final nail in the coffin was when he decided to go into Iraq unilaterally. The recent prison abuse scandal comes as no surprise for those who have studied the pattern of abuse practiced by the US armed forces since the war in Afghanistan. The only difference in the abuse taking place at Guantanamo bay, Afghanistan and Abu Gharib is that latter is out in the media causing havoc to the Bush administration.

        The head of states of the worlds richest eight nations are meeting in the United States at the moment. They will be discussing a wide range of global issues both economic and political. The tense situation in the Darfur region of Sudan, which is a human rights catastrophe as described by the UN, will be taken up today, also expected is an announcement of some kind of an aid package for the AIDS affected African nations and the rising oil prices. But still this summit is an incomplete one as the Italian Prime Minister said, Why you may ask because two of the most rapidly growing economies of the World both India and China are not involved in the discussion. How can World leaders discuss global economy without the participation of these two nations in the debate. One can only hope that the leaders of the western democracies will pay heed to what the Italian PM has said.

       Its that time of the year When my worries vanish When I get to hear A voice so clear  That can't even be matched by the best of vocals The song of the Cuckoo bird Which is more refined then the one sung by the locals Which is more pure then the one I heard  On the TV last night And nowhere in sight When bird killings are at a height Do I see a solution tight To protect these innocents Who sing for us so diligently And never have I seen a human repent For his crimes a plenty  So as a last resort I pray to thee O God! The Omnipotent Lord Save these creatures from the cunning sword Of the human who doesn't want them to retort

       Today, more than ever we need  A healing touch for all Why should innocents bleed This is a sincere call To all those who are concerned To all those who are brave To all those who hate people being burned To all those who crave For eternal bliss For an angel's kiss For a fruitful life Without any strife

       Life is a Struggle And I am all alone Playing in the puddle And going back home  I think of all the great men Who have roamed on the Earth Who have walked through the glens And were always mirth  It sure isn't easy  When one is always busy In work, not very great But its better to love life then to hate
