       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     We’ve spent a weekend in L.A., taking pictures with Perry in her graduation, and attending Nancy & Paul’s wedding. In spite of the long voyage and fatigue, it was a wonderful weekend, especially the wedding. It was definitely the nicest one I’ve ever been. It is not due to 5 stars hotel or how much money was spent, it is the warm feeling and the blissful atmosphere the newly-wed has injected. They want to bring the guests as much joy as they have. They provided the finest beverages, excellent meal; they invited the top live band to entertain. Yet, the most impressive part is that, during the banquet, they came to you, thank you and talked to you. It made you feel like you were just as significant as their family members.  We danced a lot, and I drank a lot too - 3 glasses of red wine, 2 glasses of Champaign and 1 glass of white wine.  I am longing to attend another wedding like this!   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink

       It's the 75th birthday of Anne Frank, who wrote the famous "Anne Frank's Diary", if she didn't die in the holocaust during the WWII.  She, just like you and me, loved to capture the particular shots in her daily life. Yet, in her time when the Nazi's terror was all around, her diary was not an collection of fear and tear. Instead, her story builds a tunnel of time that protect you from the bombardment and horrible sence, and guides you to her beautiful world. She has once said, "Nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world." Life is short. Hers was even shorter that her family was betrayed and killed in the Nazi concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen in March 1945 when she was 16. While in memory of Anne Frank, I hope her diary can give us inspiration on our diaries.

       This morning an old man came with a violin case. It's a Canadian case that he's just purchased from elsewhere. It looked elegant to me but was too heavy for him, who had a fragile wrist. He wanna get a lighter case and traded his. Well...it's a nice case, but we don't really need it. The old man was sad and whining. I felt sorry for that too. I then showed my sympathy by offering him a strap that might relieve some burden. It's not best option but he did show appreciation. Finally, after 15 mins trying and negotiation, he decided to buy a new lighter case and gave his case to us for discount. And the deal was made. We were both happy!   I miss you Honie...

       Last night Rebecca and I had a promenade in downtown Palo Alto hoping to find a special wedding gift. Well...it's a nice walk as there were some interesting shops selling bizarre stuffs. The Border down there was fabulous one. The interior design and the atmosphere made you feel more like an intellect. Althought we didn't find anything good for a wedding gift, we found an incredible coffee shop. Since we both are big fans of Italian coffee, we were choosing the one hanging "illy's" logo and the one selling Torrefazione. We chose the latter, and it's proved to be a right choice. It looked good and tasted fantastic. Starbucks can never make coffee like that with firm and marble-like foam milk. I highly recommand this coffee shop on University Avenue!  Another great choice: Strada in Berkeley!

       1. He had only one major publication. 2. It was in Hebrew. 3. It had no references. 4. It wasn't published in a refereed journal. 5. Some even doubt he wrote it by himself. 6. His cooperative efforts have been quite limited. 7. The scientific community has had a hard time replicating his results. 8. He never applied to the ethics board for permission to use human subjects. 9. When one experiment went awry he tried to cover it by drowning his subjects. 10. When subjects didn't behave as predicted, he deleted them from the sample. 11. He rarely came to class, just told students to read the book. 12. Some say he had his son teach the class. 13. He expelled his first two students for learning. 14. Although there were only 10 requirements, most of his students failed his tests. 15. His office hours were infrequent and usually held on a mountain top. 16. No record of working well with colleagues.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink      This is a pastel drawing that I drew on Valentine day! As a "CHEAP" boyfriend, I didn't buy flower to Rebecca. I drew this picture for her as a substitute, which I believe be more longlasting. The flowers were indeed the gift for Sonlight teachers on Valentine day. But anyway I hope you'll like it!

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink      Stanley is my favorite hang-out place in Hong Kong. The beach, the old market and the coffee shops...are the best place for a lazy afternoon!  During our HK trip in March, Rebecca and I revisited Stanley again. We walked around and passed an abandoned beach-side hut. This old and godforsaken hut somehow caught my attention and pulled my feet on that spot. No body live there now. But many years ago, there might have lived a family; kids played around and a swing hang on the tree. The happiness was all around that place. In this pastel painting, I intended to exaggerate the lifefulness by using many contradicting colors.  If you have a chance to walk around Stanley, look for this hut!!

       This afternoon at 3:00pm when I was working, my supervisor in De Anza College called me asking me if I could go to help a woman who desperately needed a tutor for the exam tommorow. I said "yes" with no considering.  After 3 years of tutoring economics in De Anza, I have regarded tutorial center is one of my house, and sort of an ideal working place. But now I can only work as a volunteer due to SJSU's prohibition. It sucks...it really sucks...it makes me detest SJSU more...! It make a free-market advocate to hate any kind of unreasonable regulation!! On the other hand, however,it show how much I enjoy teaching. Using economic term, the marginal revenue of teaching is higher than the marginal cost. In other words, for a particular hour, I am free to choose working in Scott Cao Violin or De Anza, the former get paid while the latter does not. In money term, it doesn't make sense to give up the opportunity of earning and work for no paid. Yet, it is about economics. Economic does not really deal with money. Money is not the carrot that lures the donkey move forward. Instead, it is the utility, or happiness, behind the choice leading you make decision.  Likewise, from a Christian point of view we go to church, or we help and love others are not for money(most of the time we sacrifice money), but by doing so we receive more revenue, in term of God's blessing, grace and peace.  Therefore in general, most of the economists and Christians are rich, but they are all wealthy inside.

       In the past few days, Rebecca and I have watched two magnificent movies – “Big Fish” and “The Whale Rider”. Both of them are two-thumb-up movies. “Big Fish” is a fanciful one that depicts the father-and-son relationship. The father made himself a heroic figure by telling the son many mystical bedside stories. Yet, when the son grew up, the story and the father’s heroic figure became treacherous. While the real image of the father from the son’s eyes is ambiguous, the gap between them is widened too.  It was a father-day week; this movie drove me to ruminate over the relationship between my father and me. For more than 20 years, the relationship is intertwining with love and hatred, admiration and abomination. We know we always love each other, but we don’t really know each other. He was a great mathematic teacher with no doubt, I witnessed how he tutored his students at our home after school, and this has been proved by many of his students I met, in China, the U.S, and even in Germany. For many years in their heart, my father is always a great teacher who changed their life. Even so, he is the one who ruined my interest in maths. I have thought one day I will like him to be very good at mathes. But at that time, what can you expect from an elementary kid like me to learn advanced calculus and trigonometry? When I asked him a question, what I need was just simply the answer or a hint. I didn’t expect an even abstract lesson with many clumsy equations and proofs. Gradually I stopped asking him question, and my hay-day of maths no longer exists too. In many aspects, my father is a good husband and a good father – he cooks great food, he is good at calligraphy, he helps my mom, he does the laundry, he cleans up after dinner, and he usually not allow us to clean the dishes. What can I ask for more?! Well, these are all hardware, what I need is good software. I have once said that “I will never be the kind of man like my father.”  I have confessed. God gives me the heart of forgiving and loving. I want to tell my father, “I love you!”

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     More than 12 years of my life were spent in Lei Yue Mun, a tiny fishing village which is famous of seafood, and has left me abundant of beautiful memory. After many years, the squatters as well as the village has become obsolenscent, but it's always lively and beautiful in my mind. Therefore, I project that image onto this picture.

       urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink      Kofri Ko is a great guitarist, an “accidental bassist” as well as my bass teacher in Church. You may not know who he is, but he is really cool and definitely my “idol”. Every time playing with worship team, his body size, the instrument he plays and the position he stands is not noticeable, but the way he plays and his enjoyment is just charming; his playing style always catch my attention. I should confess that sometime I didn’t pay too much attention on worship!  We have a quite fun class this morning, especially when we played “Awesome God” with the CD. In the dual-instructor class, Daniel focuses on teaching technique and theory, whilst Kofri always encourage improvising and be fastidious about our attitude.  One more interesting thing, since he is serving in Mandarin congregation, I inevitably presume that he is either from mainland China or Taiwan. But out of my expectation, he is from Indonesia. Yes! He is an Indonesian, from the place where my parents were born. We were both surprised and thrilled to know that. Wow…God is so amazing!

       The business is quite slow in this summer, dealers in others states have the same problem. Since I gradually shift my duty from setting up instruments to office work, I got much less works to do, and work under less supervision, so it seems like I got wage raised, quite alot! Another positive externality is the extra reading time. In the office, it is literally a treasury. There are abundant of academic literature, violin magazines, history books. I spent the whole afternoon reading the Journal of The Violin School of America... tons of interesting stuffs! And now, ready to go home!!

       15 years ago when I was in fifth grade, the morning after the June 4 Tiananmen massacre, we were told to dress in white, to mourn those who were killed by their “people’s army”. It was the first time in my life to witness many deaths; I might not know any of them, but I knew I was sad. My tears dropped as the democracy and people in my mother-country were compressed and fell. After these 15 years, someone involved in this incidence want to forget; someone were forgotten; someone can never forget. But a true history shall not be forgotten.

       剛收到的消息﹐澳洲MONASH大學的著名經濟學家楊小凱教授于七月七日因癌病去逝﹐享年55歲。或許你並不認識楊教授出- 他創立的新興古典經濟學派對西方經濟學有重大貢獻﹐而他的他的理論理論又被稱為“超邊際經濟學”(Inframarginal Economics)。中學時期我已經常在信報月刊閱讀他的文章。  楊教授和張五常在經濟學界同樣有著相當的名氣﹐但他比後者有更多的實質貢獻和更多的歉虛﹐亦更接近諾貝爾獎。更重要的是﹐他是虔誠的基督徒﹐他認為基督教的信仰可為一個國家的發展和改革提供一幅精確的路線圖。    可是﹐在他去後誰可以繼承他的路線圖呢。。。。。。。。。     urlLink http://community.buseco.monash.edu.au/inframarginal/Xiaokai%20Memorial/Xiaokai%27s%20funeral/index.htm

        Pastor Alan and I went fishing yesterday early morning in Santa Cruz. It is an exceptional year that the Salmon season prolongs, so we joined a group of 20 people in a fishing boat and fished in Santa Cruz and Monteray Bay.       &nbsp;   Well...I have been exhausted from Church Sport day the day before but I didn't sleep well due to nerveousness.        &nbsp;   The boat departed sharply at 6:00am. The cloudiness and calmness of the sea made the sea more mysterious to me, and everybody&nbsp;on the boat looked&nbsp;solemn and serious, waiting for a big fish when the&nbsp;boat brought them to the right spot.       &nbsp;   Fishing in the sea is quite different&nbsp;from that in the lake or in&nbsp;the creek, as&nbsp;you are&nbsp;quite likely to throw up during that 8 hours in trouble wave. Althouht I had the anti-vomit pill, I did throw up. The first time in many years.        &nbsp;   Yet, after many hours fighting against the wind and wave, we didn't&nbsp;catch anything. Looking at those people who got&nbsp;Salmon (only 10 caught, the smallest one is over 25lbs), we&nbsp;were just so jealous and daunting. And&nbsp;all my Salmon recipe&nbsp;was varnished....&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, I should have had a picture of me holding a big fish posted at here.....next time la....

        Yesterday evening we attended the Vacation Bible School's closing ceremony instead of cell group, as a support to the kids, their parents and the bros & Sis served for the whole week.          Yet, when my car change to Hwy101, we started smelling something burnt. No sooner we founded out it's not from outside than the whole car shaked. It was the first time I pulled over on the freeway, and we're shocked to see that the tire on passenger side was teared off. I didn't imagine how it'd happen to me, and more important, how to change the tire!?          While we were struggling at this wierd time, a young man pulled his small struck over in front of us, asking if we needed help. Oh man, of course!! He then helped us to change the tire skillfully and explained everything to us, saying that it happened to him three weeks ago.          When it's almost done, he suggested to follow us for a short distance to make sure the tire is safe. We told him that we're going to the church just right on the corner near the exit. "Oh, SJCAC?", he asked with a little smile. And then he showed us the Tee shirt hid under his jacket, displaying the logo of VBS "LAVA ISLAND". Praise the Lord, he is helping in VBS, he is our brother in Christ, he is a helping hand from our Lord!

        Today is an exciting day! Since the first day I work in Scott Cao Violins, I have been doing mainly the violin set up task, that means the final step to make the violin sound. The most skill required job is to craft the bridge, which I cannot manage so well. And this year, I have almost had my duty shifted to office. But today, I finally get a chance to get involved in cello crafting. There is a bottom wood for an expensive cello and need someone to shape it, in other words, we need to make it a shallow bowl shape. And I volunteered. Sang totally encouraged me to do it whilst Ding was kind of hesitating, worrying the wood would be ruined. But finally, they approved. Having everyone surrounded me, at the beginning I couldn't even get the tool in the wood, or sometime, too much. People started teasing me. Well, Sang then added that I needed to get the feeling upon the wood. And I tried, and gradually I did it as smooth as they do. It took me two hours until Sang and Ding examined the wood. My wrists and fingers are so souring....
