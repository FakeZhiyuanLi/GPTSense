                                                     The     Test       ‘The test’. I realized that everything else was of secondary importance if he failed my test. He could turn up laden with roses and chocolates every night but it would all be for nothing if he couldn’t learn to control himself.    It was a pity really.  Mike had been an incredible wonderful lover, caring, considerate of my feelings and an all round nice guy, until that final date. We had just finished dining at one of Melbournes’ exclusive restaurants, when after a leisurely walk around the Yarras’ foreshores in the heart of the city I saw it coming. Please, please I am begging you don’t. But all the tell tale signs were there, the sucking in of the cheeks, the hacking noise at the back of the throat and then Whammo. My dreams of happy every afters and little Mikes and Megans running around collapsed when a spit the size of a golf ball went flying through the air landing at the feet of a stunned little Japanese tourist who looked as if he had just witnessed the second coming. It was a sad state of affairs when the only criterion my would be lover and father of my seven children had to fill was to be a non loogie chucker.    I am not an overly picky person by any means and all I ask for in a man is little more than a pulse but, ever since that fateful day ten years ago when I had been comfortably ensconced in the family wagon happily envisioning a wonderful day at the beach, I had been assaulted with one of my fathers renowned loogies landing on my face while my mother and sisters had collapsed in paroxysms of laughter.  It was on that day that I had said to myself “Megan. If you end up with a spitter or a shifter then you deserve everything bad that will ever happen to you.” Naturally of all the guys I had dated since turning sixteen, twelve had been spitters and the thirteenth had been not only a spitter but a shifter as well. The knees going down and the righting of his package was almost as much a turn off as the spitting but not quite. So here I was, at twenty two, without a single non-spitting, non-shifting guy in sight.    Perhaps lining up at the local sperm bank was not as unappealing as I had first imagined.    Aisle 3. Blonde, Nordic good looks with a doctorate in Philosophy.    Aisle 4. Slightly shorter than average but with an incredibly witty sense of humour and able to balance a tray of champagne glasses in one hand while playing Mozart on the piano with the other. That would have to be considered as I had always harbored thoughts of having a potential Olympic gymnast in the family. There was no doubt in my mind that surely they would keep on record whether or not the would be fertilizer of my eggs was a shifter or a spitter.     I was certainly in a pondering mood as I surveyed the fridge, wondering what juicy little tidbits I could tempt Nathan with. It was my second date and so far not even a hint of shifting or spitting. Then again it had taken Mike four dates before he had shown his true colours. Punctuality. I liked that as I raced through the lounge room, stopping to glimpse through the curtains to make sure it was Nathan. Carefully flipping aside the lace ruffles, I gasped as incredibly handsome, up worldly, lawyer Nathan spat at the cat while making sure he had dressed to the left. No. No. No. Racing into the bedroom, I grabbed bunches of cotton wool and stuffed them into my ears before laying down on the bed and praying that the constant knocking on my front door would soon fade into oblivion. Oh God. What was the point?    I know I am still relatively young, but surely six years of dating would give me some insight into the male psych. Why is it I couldn’t work out why they spat and we didn’t? I wasn’t so stupid as to not know why they shifted, but couldn’t they go behind a parked car or a tree or wait till I wasn’t looking before they did it? Take me. When I got a wedgy. Did I scrunch down and retrieve the offending bits of cotton from between my butt cheeks? No. I walked around in agony for hours sometimes, risking chaffing and excruciating pain rather than have anyone witness my disgrace if I was to part the legs and go for it. I remember at the age of six when my father had come up to me in the school yard and without so much as the slightest hint of embarrassment to me had quietly bent down and pushed my legs together as I sat there with my undies showing, stating calmly, “Megs. Always remain a lady.” I had tried to live up to those standards and I would no more dream of retrieving those little bits of cotton than I would of wearing blue eyeshadow with pink lipstick. Mind you, I had been known to slip the finger down on a couple of occasions when the grunge look was fashionable. Wearing all those oversized clothes was great and nobody could tell if your whole hand went up your arse let alone two little fingers. How I missed grunge. So I digress. Where was I? Oh yes. I know I am too young to be looking for Mr wonderfully right right at the moment but things were looking decidedly grim if every man I met had the two qualities that had me running in the opposite direction. Lesbianism was starting to seem the way to go although I think I had already been there and done that and it had left me with a strange taste in my mouth. I had been eleven years old and my girlfriend Julie and I would take off for this huge field every weekend and live out our childhood fantasies. Having both come from all female families and having attended all girls schools, boys were a tantalizing mystery to the pair of us and every Saturday afternoon we would fight as to who would play the girl and who would play the boy. As Julie always had the gorgeous long hair and the lip splitting right hook, she naturally always got to play the female. As the boy it was my role to start a fight, then go down on my knees and beg for forgiveness. It was then up to Julie to decide whether or not I was to be forgiven. Sometimes the fight could last for hours depending on Julies’ mood or how long she wanted to make her daisy chain. Always though there was the racing through the knee-high grass, before falling to our knees in a loving embrace whilst kissing each other passionately on the cheeks. At the time we did not   consider that what we were doing could be construed as slightly unnatural until the day we were discovered and my life as a fledgling lesbian was put on hold. My father sat me down and explained that as far as he was concerned I could kiss and pash whoever I wanted as long as it was in the privacy of my own home. Yeah right! As it was, Julie came to school the next day sporting three great welts across her backside and without even a g’day Megan or a friendly smile she slowly and painfully alienated me. I have always wanted to thank my father for not wielding the strap the way Julies father had done. One day. So why did I open up and tell you about that episode in my life. Oh yeah. Guys. Spitting and shifting. Well anyway. Maybe lesbianism isn’t the way to go especially if I want to have children. Oh good grief. How politically incorrect is that? Of course I could still have children. Why, I wouldn’t even have to bump uglies if I didn’t want to. All I would have to do is to arrive at the sperm bank when my temperature was up armed with all the attributes I require in a guy and a turkey baster and then viola. A couple of minutes to defrost, one good squirt and there you have it. Sounds feasible to me and no spitting or shifting.

                                                       Tea Break Fiction   19 year old Kylie sat in her car stunned after delivering her frail, elderly Nanna back to her unit at the Retirement Village in Glen Waverly. Yeah right. Elderly maybe, but as Kylie shifted restlessly trying to alleviate the pain in her right buttock, she could only wonder in amazement at the mayhem that one hundred sweet, elderly pensioners had wreaked down at the local club only hours before. As soon as the club doors had swung open it had become like the Running of the Bulls as canes and walkers fought with each other in an attempt to be first into the auditorium. As it was, frail, old Nan had kept prodding Kylie in the backside with her walking cane yelling, “Grab a seat up the front!!!!” It had been sweet old Nan who had inflicted the wound to Kylies’ rear end with her constant jabbing. A few more centimeters to the right and Kylie would have been painfully and unceremoniously carried into the Auditorium. In an attempt to try and save herself from a fate worse than death, Kylie had bolted down the long, narrow hallway arriving long before anyone else. The person who had coined the phrase ‘Respect your elders’ had a lot to answer for as Kylie was pushed from pillar to post by old pensioners yelling, “This has been my table for the past 28 years”. One old gentleman had practically gloated when Kylie had given up her two seats without a fight. Not so on the other side. Two eightyish, blue capped women were going at it until two, burly, bruiser types sporting the clubs logo had to be called in to sort the two of them out. Finally Nana arrived and she was not a happy little vegemite. “What’s the good of you? We are stuck behind a pole.” “I…I…” Goodness. Kind, sweet, never out of sorts Nan seemed a tad irate.            “Just sit down and don’t move.” Kylie watched gobsmacked as frail, old, recently hip replaced Nana practically sprinted across the table, wanting desperately to be first at the table where people were already queuing waving five dollar notes in the air. A few minutes later Nan appeared, throwing down a book of cards pronouncing loudly, “You owe me five dollars. Now don’t miss any of the numbers.” With a few minutes to spare before the games began, Kylie watched in fascination as her Nan and a couple on the other side of the table rummaged around in their string bags and pulled out four leaf clovers, rabbits feet and strange little plastic dolls with ugly faces and green hair, placing them at strategic points around their cards. “Legs eleven, no eleven, top of the shop number ninety, two fat ladies eighty eight.” Kylie practically fell off her seat as the caller droned on and on. “Eighty four. Eighty four. Eighty four.” Nan whispered none too quietly. Kylie could only sit and pray for number eighty four to be called just to shut her up. How embarrassing. “Number eighty four, eight fou…” “Bingo.” Screeched Nan beside her. Kylie watched and then started to worry as frail, never raise your voice Nan started taking spasms in her excitement. Suddenly Kylie started getting almost as excited realizing that Nan must have won a fortune. Four dried up chicken wings and a box of crackers later, Kylie was bemused to discover that she had paid out five dollars and that was all she could hope for? Oh please. “We will now have a twenty minute break.” Exclaimed the caller. Thank God. Whoosh. Kylie had to grab hold of the table as polyester and lycra whizzed past her rattling dollar coins in their wake. A few minutes later, Kylie stood open mouthed as Nana emptied her pension fund into one of the slot machines which covered every empty space in a room almost twice the size of the one she had just left. After getting her Nan a drink and a seat, Kylie had the uneasy feeling that she was contributing to the downfall of a much loved relative. Twice she had tried to speak to her Nan and twice she had been rudely rebuffed as Nan poured all her concentration into the ugly little clowns faces which kept popping up in gay abandon. Spare me. Kylie had to leave the room just in case Nan won five dollars. She simply did not have the energy to scrape her Nan up off the floor.  Driving home, Kylie had plenty of time to ponder over the last four hours and she couldn’t help but think that if Hitler had been alive today and had needed to revive the Third Reich, then all he would have had to do was to enlist the aid of the blue rinse set. Bazooka wielding Russians could not have stopped them if games of Bingo offering chicken wings and trays of bananas had been set up at strategic intervals across Europe. Kylie was convinced that compared to these so called frail, elderly pensioners, Hitler was a pussy and thank god he had not had enough  sense to recruit the likes of the Bingo playing pensioners or we would all be sitting here drinking Schnapps and eating sauerkraut at this very point in time. Kylie had just arrived back home when the phone rang. It was Nan. “Kylie dear. About next week.” “Don’t you worry Nan. I know the drill and there is no way we are going to get stuck behind a pole again.”
