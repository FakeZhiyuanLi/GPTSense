      haha. *hugs to my hemann twin* does anyone even read this blog? i swear, it's just a form of like, superfluous communication bt me, you, and ragie poo. hey, that rimes.   aww..........that was nice. u know, i should have left more time for u alone. bc of what should have happened. that didn't (?). sorry guys. me and my alone-ness shouldn't affect y'all. lol but glad u guys had fun.  be thankful yue, ur parents will always be there for ya at least. gosh my parents are so SCHIZO!!!! my mom has no qualms about kicking me   out   of cars, and my dad has no qualms leaving me places when i need to get picked up. i swear, between my parents, i'm going to need my own car sooner or later or i'll end up being a waitress in a diner in colorado just because i am stranded. dont ask where that came from. anyway.....  yes, my parents tell me i am a frivolous spender as well. :-( it's alright. but i am definitely getting that graduation snoopy for jason. or i dunno, i have many other, more worthwhile seniors i might wanna give it to. if he's an ass, he aint getting it. lol. or maybe i shant wake up early enuff to shop and get it. or i'll be too lazy to? yes, definitely. well i dunno. well.......most likely anyway.   so main events today: got up at 10.40-ish. rags called. GD you, you and ur waking up skills. ur mad. absolutely mad. goodness. thanks tho, if i had woken up later i would lost it. as in, bee later than i already was.  went shoping about 11.30-ish. got a lovely triple chocolate cake at sam's (later sampled at the party described below, and found to be too sweet for my horrible horrible throat.), and also listened to my dad grumble about the cost of tide. so i decided to be kewl and recomended some all to him after seeing all those supermodel butler commercials. also went shopping for shoes. had fight in the middle of shoe department about color of shoes. i won. i'm so glad my dad is so that if u just stick to ur guns, he'll always give in. he wanted me to get these really garish blue and gray sketchers. and u know my thing with/against sketchrs. so he gave in and i got white adidases. [adidii?] oh right i was supposed to look up what adidas meant. nike=goddes, puma=some sort of cat, reebok=deer thingy, etc etc.   had fun with raghu and yue. yes......she summed it up pretty well. and i added the getting left at borders thing.  the party, what we've all been waiting for: got there late, doesn't matter. had fun experience the west u lifestyle. ig ot it figure dout. bellaire --> jewish and soccer mommish.  west u --> town and country mom. lol. yah  anyway, had loads of fun. nice food , great people (best ppl in earth, i tell ya) and the intelligence level in that house musta been like a 200 IQ or something. i'm sure mine brought it down though. lol.  toasts for ms. medlen, mock round, presentation of gifts and letters, yadayadayadah.   oh but hte funniest part EVEr was the team pictures they took. ms.medlen got like 5 of us in various poses, but hte ones we got weren't that uptight either. of the various hilarious things in it, these are my faves:   thomas and his girly feet kevin and his "i'm a supermodel" look around the back pose. andrew and his short napolean, hand in the jacket pose eric with a wide berthe on every side of him will clutching his crotch larissa feeling up will's ass behind him sneakers on the entire frnt row kelly looking angry paul smirking like franklin and me, tiffnay, josh, and ruidi are just too happy. put all of us + hotze in a room....and damn u could have urself a margarita party. w/o margarita.  (dont worry yue, i wont have a hangover tomorrow morning i didn't drink. although i must say there is now a large half empty bottle of jack daniels on their kitchen counter now.........hehe)  i met noah's gf mary. more details later, or prolly i'll forget so yue ask me.   continuing my correspondence with stubbs. he asked me about the hemann twins today. man was that hilarious.  i'm so boring. ANYWAY.........nam goes to columbia. interns for NBC. was on AC. went to France speaks it fluently. he's me, cept.......a guy? *shudder*  anyway so i am really disappointed in myself cuz Paul said " quatre vingt treize" and it took me 5 minues to figure out. literaly. (that's 93 for those of u who dont know. and i have just disgraced myself EVEN MORE because until 2 seconds ago when i reanalyzed that i thought it said 1813. oh god what's happening to me).  all for now. love you all. see you tomorrow too.  i swear u guys, i am gonna be ur wedding planner u guys make my day. i'll start writing hte toast now since i'm bound to lose some things. oohhh i just thought of something really funny and cruel to say at ur rehearsal dinner. i guess we still haven't got how the secular wedding will go huh?

      ok. forget what i said yesterday for a moment. there are some times i just feel like i should stop caring, b/c some ppl (namely my parents) are just so unreasonable and insensitive. i just want to thank those of you who do care and make this life worth living. ^_^  anyways, today was fun. great time looking through those magazines at borders and commenting on whether the guys had pecs or some other more feminine feature. haha i think i'm in love w/ interior decorating/design now that i've seen so many of those "home" magazines. bed bath and beyond was nice (rags is in love w/ the towels/rugs/pillows! i don't blame him). jane's gonna become a wedding planner and hire someone else to do the photography (she needs to be carefull w/ the zooming) ;). i would so pay $20 for those soft towels. my mom thinks i'm a frivolous spender. so what if i am? it's all about the personal happiness! haha i think AS is catching up to me. and i haven't even read it! oh gawd what is happening to me?  anyways, a early happy b-day to my hemann twin! hope you have a great time at the AC party and NOT be on a hangover tomorrow at graduation. J/K!!! send me the directions so i can get that very important pic! thankie

      you can say that i'm disappointed. or maybe just not overly content? i mean this year has been... just a normal year. dismal in ways. i've witnessed and taken part in the breaking of the fellowship that was (some are convinced never was) BAM. i've watched ppl change from conservative asian to whatever they consider themselves now (jane and i think they're white prep wannabes who will never really be preps b/c they aren't white) and still criticize others for doing the same. i've watched other ppl read certain books *cough cough* and forget that human nature is not evil. i watched the same ppl ruin my life and my happiness for nothing (or maybe they get a kick out of it. who knows/who cares) each consecutive week. still others are just recluses that i no longer hear from (partly b/c they don't want to talk to me). maybe that's what i'll be next year. a hermit. that way i won't be involved in all the politics and such that is part of being in a certain "group." there used to be a time when you were either someone's friend or you weren't. now it's like she's not your friend so i can't be her friend. oh well. i doubt anyone would understand what i'm talking about. if not for lack of trying, for lack of caring. i don't blame you if you don't care. in fact, i see no reason that i do.

      sorry jane. you know how i am. i don't do something unless i absolutely "have to". anyways, where were you today? me nd rags called you like a hundred times and no one picked up.  aww... you're sick. get better soon twin!  oOo. btw, tell me where the graduation is cuz i have nothing to do on sunday and i'm going to get that pic no matter what! ^_^ yes the crazy jounalist is kicking in. haha  tennis definitely, but lacrosse... don't we need equipment for that? haha  i must say, this first day of summer has been the dullest day of my life! i mean, there's only so much you can do by yourself at home. so bascially after giving up on the TV, phone, and comp, i resorted to completing that vocab workbook thing we never touched in class and looked at prospective cases for next year's LD (which took like an hour to upload to my comp for some reason). -_- somebody save me. tell me how you occupy your time w/o dying of boredom. please!

      oh right one more thing. it's come to my attention that a realy annoying trait i have is that i am easily swayed by the wrong people.  yue asked me today: "if jason asked you to do something, and liang asked you to do the same thing, who would u rather go with?"  i knew the answer right away. and it hasn't changed despite a few months of personal denial. i dont know why it ihasn't. i LIKE hanging out with liang more , and every experince with jason is merel a disapiintment, and i know it.   i just want to say i'm sorry. mostly to liang cuz she tries so hard to steer me back on the right track, but to everyone. i listen i really do. i was just about to make an excuse for it, but i guess i really shouldn't. i suppose i go for the buzz it/he gives me. it's a drug.

      i've got nothing much to say.  i'm tired. that's basically it. i stayed up late studying geography last night. of course i would have been to sleep 2 hours earlier if eleanor hadn't called wanting help with geometry. not that i am mad, i love it. i love being a teacher. i'd either be a teacher or a writer when i grow up.  but here's seomthing weird. i am sucha hypocrite. i tell ppl not to rely on intentions. i do the same. i tell ppl t o focus. i surely am not. i tell ppl to calm down and stop being immature. put me next to josh and i'm such a baby.  but the thing i feel like writing today is basically, me comforting myself that it's ok to be shallow. selfishness i got down like *snap*, but i need to stop being shallow. i'd always prided myself on not caring if a guy was all weird u know, or if a friend was not hte brightest crayon in the box.  but seriously....i think thre needs to be some limits. i will give anyone a chance, i really will to expect me to not reject someone i think is horribly dull or boring or stupid would just be denying who i am. i refuse to settle. i do not dumb down who i am. but i refuse to sit there and spoonfeed a normal conversatipn to someone. just as i refuse to pretend something about someone is not true, if i dont like it. i'm sick of it. i'll do what i want. and as shallowly as i can.  but then again.......i'm a huger hypocrite than that. lately i've been noticing that all i do is critique my friend's guys. for example, all i do whenever rags calles yue is just yell aat him and fight. i'm sorry i dont mean to be so ....... cynical and sarcastic and a bitch. really i am. i hope ur feeling kewler. and just today i told liang that "he" was a condescending little jerk. how hypocritical of me to day, when jason is probably the evillest of them all, and that i still go for that authoritative, arrogant attitude. infact, i demand it. how i can i detest him for hunching over when i myself go for most chubby guys? i need to calm down. sheesh.  i'm tired. party moved to next week, too many ppl busy, and i'm too pooped out. now all i have to worry about is the AC party. and then starting work at hte zoo. and crap. and getting meena to finish AS so i can give it to eleanor.  that book should come with a warning "WARNING: May wash your brain and cause extreme sarcasm, cynicism, arrogance, and egoism."  oh right, the reason i was evil is egoism may not be the same thing as egotism, but it sure does lead that way, which is why i need to turn back around.  but u know what, i think i'd trade all the attention and glamour and succes in the world for some peace. xi gasped when is aid that, and i was offended htat he did so.  if someone offered me to bypass the glory waiting for me in school and a career, i'd accept if i'd get a husband, a couple kids, and a farm in new zealand in exchange. plus a few good books.   i'm so tired.

      wow. blogger is pretty unsafe. i tried to click on yue's link for pics, only to discover that it was taking awhile to load, so i clicked on back to just write a post,, and then go look at pics. -_- and it actually took me BACK!  to here....the unsafeness of it all. sheesh.  well anyway, as yue says, we did have rather...er.....discussion about pretty sensitive subjects. everyone we know is a prude. just about........rags, the most, abraham says SOMETHING at least....and well jason and kyle. u know how thye are. not that they are tell all, but if u ask a Q they will say everything that anyone could want to know. that we didn't want to know it, but if we hadn't, it would have been odd. not that we are great terms or anything either.  wow, and now blogger is constantly renewing the same pages with the posts. oh....apparently i have DHTML on THIS computer so it works out nice. i think it's cuz i've neglected to update my IE on that one. sheesh. it's the same.....!  anyway........not much to say except a bunch of literary comments.  Tender is the Night - has got to be hte second best book i've EVER read. damn you jane austin..u really suck. dont even get me started on what a phony dickens is. Daniel Defoe, i forgive you. u are still welcome in my sphere of influence.  The Catcher in the Rye  - has got to be the BEST book i've EVER EVER EVER read. yue says there is no point. at this point i cant really deny that, since i haven't found the point either. but really......it feels like thre IS one. i'm going to go read the cliff notes to it and see what the point is. anyway, i still think it's great. the digressions, the swearin, the run on sentences just about kill me. see? now i'm even talking like holden. holden caulfield.....man tha'ts gotta be the sexiest name ever. haha maybe i just like it bc it reminds me of my unedited manuscript, cept it's actually somewhat interesting and non-party of fivish. or, it could just be because he is in love with a girl named jane who he wont call. oh well.  what ever it is, i was up really late last night analyzing my life bc of it. im such a wreck. damn you atlas shrugged. i'm a cynical, sarcastic bitch. everything that comes from my mouth is a cynicism. not that i am not happier, but what is it really? it's.......nothing. i have no feelings. i am devoid of any non-objective emotions. i am not ever insanely happy, nor does anything ever move me to tears anymore besides cheesy movies. i can't even pretend that i love anyone anymore. of course, i really care for all of u guys and i worry about ur helathy/safety/feelings and all but.......that feeling. where your chest just wells up and you feel like ur going to burst from the warmth. yah, it's gone. replaced merely by a feeling of surprise. this is the most shallow part of it all but i can't even feel anything for a guy anymore. i, who used to fal in love with guys over the internet. i know it's not that the right one hasn't come along. there are so many people who are worthy of me getting a little teary. and i just can't. damn me and my philsophy. i dont even know who i am anymore. i'm......INGRID (symbolically, i actually admire her quite a bit.). i'm losing my chinese values. i dont want to. but i try to lose them purposely. and i try to plunge myself in a world of western capitalism and stoicism. but i hate it when i'm there. AHHHHH. damn you! and i hope the "you" is understood.  anyway, enough of that. i still dont get how yue's foot can get run over and her not be.....u know, in a cast or something. i'm worrying about hairline fractures.......or what u can call worrying inside me.   i'm sorry about ur parents. they are crazy. they really are. the room searching is horrible too.....*sigh*. but we all go thru that. yes, even me and my schizo parents. i wonder, how is liang. she seems happier lately.  itinerary (to remind myself of things to do):  coffee all week; i hope theye njoy the brownines. yes stefan, i've made more cake. tues: english and geo final. storm the admin. go home. slack off. study. wed: geometry. meet hotze. (maybe....a good thing?) argue for evil. AC practice. go home. slack off. study thurs: bio and debate. suck up a lot if my storming the admin hasn't been enough. movies. relax. no wait..i 'll read some more. fri: planning for/going to picnic.  sat: go shopping. must get some "conservative shorts" for the zoo. also, buy a dessert for the AC party. i wonder...pie or cake? or something else....cookies? hmm...i'll ask josh. go to party. mingle with people who will save my soul.  sunday..........sleep. relax. possibly go swimming for hte first time in forever. early morning, deffinitely. play tennis. jog. get exercise. be good to my body. try to recover my sanity in the solace of physical stress. then ti's off to graduation where i can lose my mind again. damn you ragz for getting out of it. i wonder, what shall i wear? oh right.....greeeennnn.  one of these days this summer, i think i will go on a spree of debate clothes. (haha yue....)  but i saw some disposable swimsuits in seventeen. what's the deal with that? how r they disposable?. are htye disposable only cuz they're cheap or cuz they're easy to put on, or what? i dont get it. but they look nice so i think i want some. except i prolly couldnt work it. haha. me and my boyish figure. but i still figure i have more hips than guys. one oft hose "sensitive issues". lol.  Ie is still constanly renewing the bottom window. scary.

      no need to worry, i shall tell now of yesterday's happenings:  life is just great. why? it’s just peach keen. HA! if only I could say that in a non-sarcastic way.  I go to dinner… everything seems fine until they start talking. Two ppl yelling in my ear until I put down my food and go to my room. I can’t sleep. my mom yells at me to finish my food. so I go downstairs again… I don’t know who to listen to, my dad who thinks I have a disease b/c I never speak to him, or my mom, who searched through my room while I was conveniently taking my English final at school. what a life. they keep on talking, both unaware of each other and of me; they don’t see I’ve begun crying. maybe they ignore be b/c they see it as normal. it’s a daily occurrence.  so basically after what seemed like forever of yelling back and forth, they come to this conclusion: 1) i can no longer associate w/ any guys 2) my dad has threatened to call the police if rags calls the house again -_-  and that's all that you will ever need to know about that  today's events: -woke up at 10-ish -got call from jane at 10:50 telling me to meet her and zuhair at borders at 11:30 -go to borders, and get debate definitions from the comm apps book, while david and zuhair do geog (lmao throughout, cuz jane makes me high... hehe) -finds out i'm not the only one w/ crazy azn parents: david's mom hears jane and me talking in the background when he calls her and comes to pick him up -_- -goes to little myako's for lunch (beef teriyaki bowl! i think they cheaped us out though. those slick japanese!) -had interesting convos w/ rags, abe, jason, and kyle about "sensitive issues" haha it was fun! -stopped by bridesmart to look at the ugly dress they have in the display. just as we were about to charge in and demand to see the other prettier one, we discover that they had closed 30 min earlier! arg!!! *gasp*) -went to smoothie king during a deluge of calls from rags... hehe it almost got to the point that the ringer tune was constant (you WILL learn how to dance! and will NOT become a truck!) -returns to borders and decides jane wants her bridal registry there, just so she can look at those cookbooks (i must admit, there were some pretty awesome ones! ^_^) -went home and typed up my debate stuff to send to ppl -update pics (they finally work!!!):  urlLink My Pics!   sorry (you know who you are) i only wish i could take those words back somehow. to repair the damage i've caused.

      let's see... i woke up at 9 today, only to go back to sleep and wake up at 12-1ish. i think i'm becoming narcoleptic. oh well  that was an interesting message by rags' pearland ppl... hehe  stooopid H&H and those publishers that never have anything in stock! -_- just when i've finally picked my violin up and tune it after a year of neglect, i can't get a bow (of course, i could just go by myself, but where's the fun in that?)!!! argness  jane: stop spazzing about my foot. it's fine. oh yea, if it bothers you that much, talk to him about that thing that he does all the time.  yahoo photos is aggravating me... i wait like 15 minutes for the pics to upload, then they tell me it's completed. but when i go check, NOTHING'S there!!!! something has to be wrong w/ their system or my comp... blish

      friday! the LAST one of this year! woohoo! -> 2 finals down... 4 more to go.  near death experience today (rags please don't feel bad, it's NOT your fault!): we were walking back from meyerland after we both got our chocolate brownie frappucinos, and we are at this crossing sign thingy. the traffic light is red, so we decide we can cross. we get to the middle of the street, then cars start turning from the the other side. he tells me to walk back. i feel something, look up, and realize that a car had run over my foot. i'm fine... but he feels guilty he put me in that position. now he's being overprotective. which is very "awwing" but still... i'm not a baby!  oOo! add on to yesterday's stuff: obv jane can't walk while she's in my house... she kept crawling on her knees everywhere i went!  i think i'm gonna be posting up some pics this weekend if it's fine w/ u guys. please do not sue me for public exposure (is that what they call it?)

      hey everybody. well i just got home. and i'm back online. and not studying. who would have expected that?  i hope my twin and ragz had fun listening to me spread really badly. so do i have a tick or not? oh well...anyway. wow......the control panel is diff than on yue's comp. the note at hte bottom says that i dont have DHTML. wtf?! anyway..................  i decided what to do with my old blog. since it's undeletable (unlike this blog) then i'm stuck with it. and since i'm really weird and stuff then there's nothing i can do about it, and i can't bear to get rid of it. i'll keep it for personal musings that are mostly crap, and which shouldnt be used to waste space on this wonderful one. :-)   please refer to http://ix.1sound.com/schizo if u have ne Q's. lol  as fo rmy yahoo email add.....*sigh* i'm getting rid of it. oh well. i hope the spammers dont find me, they're getting out of hand. how many times do u have to tell someone that you aren't interesting in sexual aids? yetch...  speaking of which......  so there have been two analogies to driving safety these past few days.  1) jon and muthu said during their round "a mentally ill child is like a persistent drunk driver. u can't give them a choice, u have to take away their liscence to ensure public safety" (i can't believe the judge thought that was crap) 2) mr zumwalt pondering to hte entire class why we dont have to have licences before we have sex bc it's just as or more dangerous than driving. *ewwness*

      we assume you know who we are.  jane is fascinated by: 1) this blog "so much better than ix!" 2) my telephone wiring 3) the window blind remote 4) the backyard 5) the tree in the front yard "it's a flagpole!" 6) my medications 7) empty bottles of chardonnay (don't ask)  things that we *me and yue( can't do together):  1) type 4) talk 7) breathe 2) pull above and 85 in db8. (resentetnt flows thru our veins......) 9) speeel  stuff that happened today: in the morning everyone congregated on the third floor by the windows to hide from the cameras. (jane didn't know this actually worked). jane wasn't there obv. (late)  nothing happened in class. it was a dismal ending to a dismal (yue thinks) year. i thought it was a great yr. the ending sucks tho. yue thinks the second sem was good now.    we found out that i (who else) was schizo as a toddler as well. i relate to u this story:  many years ago when i was 3............  jane's mom: let's go to the carnival jane: NO!! jane's mom: alright then, let's go somehwere else.  5 min later.......  jane: [crying] i want to go to the carnival!!!!!! jane's mom: it's closed.  someone tell me (yue) (*cough* JASON *cough*) how to post pictures.  anecdote of the day:  so i'm in french, and ms.simon says , looking at me "i just love it when ppl white out things and then forget to write nething in the space."  other anecdote of hte day: so me and my twin are searching ALLLLLL day for jason. apparently he was in an AP at lunch. RIGHT. anyway.......so we're at her locker at the end of the day, ready to chargge downstairs and barage him for my YB, when he appears. whether it was pure accident or whether he cared enuff to return it to me, i dont know. anyway, so he comes, returns YB, acts rather coldly, and yue says "pic!" . he says nothing but consents. anyway so we're standing. yue is focusing, and then........the screen blanks out!!!!! apparently the batteries have run out. and he has no finals. and is going to college. fun fun. however, his yb entry did provide SOME solace after shaft told us we had a 88 and 82 respectively, for our 6 week's avgs. -_-

      musings for the day:  no no no......that tank top was not a girls' size 16, it was a ladies XS. haha i know, much better. well come on..it IS!   your dad is hilarious.   i just found out that greenday did a remake of "paranoia" by harvey danger. i sure hope the one i dled was the original, there's enough fakeness here to last a lifetime. haha..i like all hte remakes of old songs. one esteemed mr garber finds that a little annoying but it's alright. hee hee hee. i will commercialize him out with me and my wonderful mix of commericial rock and pop. hee hee hee.......but i have yet to be enlighted so oh well.  went swimming today......looked in the mirror. dude ur right, i need to bulk up. wait a sec, if i bulk up, then the proportions will be all wrong again. lol. i couldnt help noticing that i need to do some situps. yees yes i now ur like "WHAT?!" but i mean....if i'm going to be that thin i might as well be consistently thin.  spent the whole day taking advantage of kazaa.   but anyways...i LOVED yesterday!!! being with you guys is really fun. but it's odd really, i had my "lesbian lover" time, my "alone to muse" time, and of course, josh time. lol. oh, but reading that judaism for dummies book was GREAT. i feel really smart. and of course, making myself feel good is the only thing that matters....JK JK!  but i'm still aghast: Old Navy does not carry skirts. or not the kind i was looking for anyway......remember that skirt from Express that i was obsessed with? i went to old navy to see if they ahd a similar, maybe a little more conservative one, and they didn't!!!! they only had really really really fugly debate skirts (ur right, i dont think prints work anymore) or like, jean ones that worked equally as badly. *tear* when will the day come when the khaki skirt will receive its glory?  hope u enjoy the beans.......i used to like em, but isn't it annoying how they keep getting stuck in ur teeth? and especially with the braces now.  i went over to josh's and had a very good time. his dad makes ribs   love all u guys.......... i spent hte whole day downloading stuff. i think i mighta said that already, but now i feel like abusing kazaa so tell me more stuff to download. i'll just write it down on te dry erase board and have an ass spanking good time ;-)  justin's back from camp. poor guy.  ani ohevet otrach, your judaica scholar

      ahh geezus... you are supposed to "happly oblige" whenever someone offers you a jelly belly... but no no  no ... mr. garber wants to avoid anything i give him apparently and the resentment continues.  i brought home that jar and my parents are once again aghast at my senseless spending. my dad thinks that all the jelly beans taste the same... so we made him close his eyes and try to guess which ones were which. he didn't get any correct.  i couldn't even tell which were which. even though they gave you a color key and such, the markings on the beans were quite obscure and there are like 10 kinds that are all orange!!! how am i supposed to tell the difference between an orange juice and a tangerine?!?!  i cannot believe that old navy's childrens size 16 is too big for you! haha you need to like bulk up majorly! j/k i love you just the way you are!!! *hugs&kisses* (oh gawd there's me and my bi thing again. hahaha)  btw: bertie bott's every flavor beans are made by jelly belly. i wonder if they did anything to the vomit flavored ones so that ppl will actually eat them?

      oh begeezus. parents. *shakes head* well, asian parents anyway....not even jewish parents can compare to them. i was talking to eleanor today, and apparently carly ( u know, from the zoo) is really out there sometimes. poor thing. she needs the loving care of an asian friends.......lol look how nicely eleanor turned out.  dont worry about your parents. my parents say the same things. *gasp* they think i'm too immatuer to keep friends? lol well i've heard that too, along with "friends at this age are useless, you will just lose them before they get to do anything for you but they will use you [hypocrisy mania here]" and "it's not that i am not allowing you to date, i just think that at this age you are too busy and you are going to get distracted and your grades will fall and you will screw up just like at pearland." salt in the wound all the way......but hopefully we can provide each other with a little water to rinse it out. why the symbolism today? i have no idea.  my day was actually rather dismal. i got up early, went to Uh with eleanor. we got all excited and went to lunch early with a bunch of uncut evidence to work while eating. well.......we had an early lunch (i got a LARGE chili and it nearly killed me, her large frosty nearly killed her as well. why is there no meds. at wendy's?), and then teh scientist came on and we got all "awww" so we were just like holding each other on the couch watching it. yes yes yes......beacoup de strange looks. well, qu'est-ce que je peux dire? lol. you know we'd do the same thing....i'm sure josh is saying right now "what freshmen" and shaking his head. lol.  but anyhows we get back and basically no more work get done because depression, anxiety, and panic attacks set in.  after independent reviews by josh, avinash, mr stubbs AND rach, the sad truth is that me and eleanor's evidence is pretty shitty. yes yes, most of them tried to spare our sensitive feelings and they dress it up but u know we're not stupid. at least rach was really nice about it though and he was all "well it's good stuff u just need to get deeper in the arg" and he kept smiling and those blue eyes kept twinkling with suppressed frustration and laughter and then when he left he offered to look for a few cards for us. wow, what an awesome coach. HE ROCKS!!!! lol i heard that he pulled a knife on shaft at a gas station. that i highly doubt as a) mr rach rocks and b) this story was told by shaft, but either way he deserved/deserves it. the next time i see him i think i'll "spill" hot coffee in his crotch.  so anyhows, josh leaves and i leave with him, he is doing some stuff with his dad so i go home. still depressed, bc now i've got stuff to do but not in a cool setting so i am all "i'll just go burn a cd". well......since compiling from multiple cd's was harder than i thought (but thank goodness i have a decent burner the stories i hear from eleanor's and jason's burner's were really disturbing), it took like an hour and a half. well of course, there is incompetence on my part as well, as always, so lol.....but anyway......in the end it turned out. it's pretty good too, cept i got pissed off cuz one of the best songs in the world wouldn't burn (anti-piracy software?) and i couldn't put it on there, and i had to substitute it for a less good song.   anyway, so yah just in case anyone wants to know what is the best song in the world by the cheapest most bloated recording label ever is...it's "angel" by sarah mclachlan. i demand all of you...DL it now!!!  not much else has happened. blogging, on aim, email. oh, i changed my signature and stationary. the stationary is now permanently "clear day" and my signature is basically a pretty naggy message telling you guys to all be happy. lol.   geez............u know what, i think i am really into that soccer mom thing. i was reading ur thing about u starving in college, but u konw what? u wont starve! i'll cook for u. i know u think i'm pretty incompetent at it, but really i think i'm starting to get it.....*cough* cough* but i still dont know anything so *cough* what i'd like for my birthday are *cough* cookbooks. lol. and sure, that "growing up chinese" book by iris chang cant hurt but watch it be the joy luck club all over........lol. but at least u wont be hungry in the mornings.........i hear my pancakes are lovely. :-) but my parents have to stop cheaping out and buying margarine. it didn't go so well.....or i guess they could just buy me a gallon of whipping cream and i could "shake, shake, shake ..... shake shake shake......shake my BUTTER". lol.  anyway.......yah since i'm bored and this is always a fun topic, ill talk more about our psycho parents.  your parents are really really cool in one respect: they are predictable. the stability....man i love it. haha maybe that's why i crave it, cuz my parents never gave me any, and bc i have none to offer anyone else. lol. well...i guess that goes back to the soccer mom thing. i just realized, i have been talking in circular tangents thoughout this whole post........................lol. but yah, they are predictably....uber conservative. dont worry, my parents are racists too (plus whatever not liking jewish ppl is).  but haha they ARE oblivious. i still dont get what you mean by that "i think your mom suspects" thing. how could she? lol she prolly just thinks i am getting too much into debate and eleanor. as for debaet, well i've heard that lecture before (it's taking over ur life!), and the eleanor lecture too (she's too crazy; she'll take over ur life!) but good thing she would not suspect the lesbian thing. haha, if i really was eleanor's girlfriend there'd be no diff in my habits so oh well. lol. woh, that came out wrong. lol. well u know what i mean.  tell rags to call me dammit...i'm not mad at him and he SUCKS for thinking that. kristy says liang has accepted josh? the total flipside worries me. and makes me think she's still being weird. *sigh* well it is sort of my fault for not calling. i will i will.....but geez i get home so late, i spend so long online......and then it's too late to call. sheesh.   now i'm just tired. my neck is aching.................  someone remind me to download all those songs, strongbad videos, the scientist video, the windows media update, and i guess it wouldn't hurt to try and delete my old blog. *shudder* those days absolutely scare me. haha i am going to reread them and get really freaked out. see, i told u a blog was a good idea........  well that's all for now.   ani ohevet otach!   jane

      the grade isn't terrible (1450) but my dad isn't too impressed (*gasp* you can only get into UT/Rice!?!). he tells me to do better the next time i take it... only now he can't say anything cuz i got that grade despite preparing for it. HA! man... he's expecting like a perfect score or something the next time... begeezus (however you spell that word... hehe)  sample of a daily dinner anecdote (this "joke" was told today by dad): one chinese family had an only child. a daughter. she went off and got involved w/ a black man. her family gave her an ultimatum: either marry the guy and be disowned... or find a "proper" [Caucasian] guy to marry.  i don't get what's so funny about that. but supposedly my dad's friend (who told him this story) told him to give his daughter a proper (racist, i'll bet) upbringing so my future's not "wasted". that's not funny either. gawd... i can't believe my own parents are still like that. my dad blames it on Chinese society... which has historically been closed and therefore does not welcome people of other races w/ open arms/hearts (so he says). but you'd think that after spending so much time abroad he would have become more tolerant? guess not.  we decide to go to the store after dinner to buy goggles. i turn the radio to 94.5 and dad starts listening to this song. he then  asks  (the radio or the guy singing?) "how do you know?" in response to the song lyrics, which where like "i don't think anyone feels the way i do... about you now". GAH!!! i wanted to strangle him so bad. so me and my mom had to explain to him that music is about self expression and art... not science! geez!!!!!  when we're at the store... my dad comments on how many b-day gifts i had to buy lately. he suggests to me to not have as many friends so i wouldn't have to spend  his  precious money to buy so many presents. i asked him how he would like it if ppl were stringent when it came time for them to buy him gifts.  we then get into a discussion about "jane's friend who is a boy" (i told them the goggles were for your friend so they wouldn't get suspicious). dad assumes that i'm only buying something to save face for you. he also says (get this) that any friend of jane's won't be her friend for long. apparently he thinks your too young to keep your friends or something... geh!!! again... the need to strangle. my mom still remembers jason from "the pizza place" so we talk about him. i tell them he's already graduated (they asked how old he was) and that he was going to trinity for college. so i gather that my dad's boss's wife also went there b/c UT austin was "too big".  i comment on how i thought that the yeast balls my mom bought look like food... and she says "then let the yeast ferment in your stomach" nice, huh?  and to add to all of that, i get a mosquito bite or swelling where the fire ant bit me... grrr. ooo btw the only mosquito that currently resides in my house just happens to live in my bathroom. i spent most of wednesday trying to get him... but he just decides to hide out in the hinges of the cabinets! ARG!! i guess i'll risk west nile then.  i desparately need to finish HP5 so i'll let jane blog now

      my parents have officially become slackers. i woke up today to the smell of chinese food wafting from the dining room... only to find out that they have ordered in from silver palace (btw...  does  that place look tacky now or what? i mean... neon green signs??? what were they thinking? their owner better be chinese or there would just be no way to explain it). i'm not complaining that the food was bad (it was a pleasant change from what my mom usually makes) but gawd... what am i gonna do in college when there's no meal at saturday evening and i'm by myself in the dorm starving? haha you all are going to have to teach me how to cook one day.  speaking of college... my dad has this crazy idea that we should start college visits this year... in fact... this July 4th!!! he wants me to go see the UT austin campus... under the pretense of visiting his old buddies there. somebody needs to get me a closet so i can hide in it until they issue a missing person's report. haha  anyways... sorry for the lack of details... there's really so much you can say about a person w/ no life.

      wow, you gotta love the supreme court. well.......almost. thank goodness sodomy laws are out. i can't believe that though, omg there must be a million homosexuals getting it on every night in texas, yet apparently its been illegal the whole time. it's about time someone got rid of those laws. besides being sort of oppressive and overly conservative, nobody listens to them anyway.  but that aff action thing is still ticking me off severely. -_-  anyway.....well i just realized i didn't have that much to say after last night.  zoo shorts just came in. damn, they are cute. i feel sporty. almost as sporty as if i was wearing the lacrosse skirt.  speaking of which, i had my interview with claire today. (she was in lax too) haha, she said "haha, u like the skirt? u can have mine." i can't imagine why. it's really cute but she seems more into savvy chic than preppy plaid and cute. lol. makes sense makes sense.....cosmopolitan verteran reporter, teaching flegding staff writer the ways of the world.....er...bellaire.  anyhows, so the interview went well. i think she might think i'm a little psycho, with me and my forced overenthusiasm. yue, i figured it out: the way to seem not bitchy, yet not to be from aluhbama, is to be overly enthusiastic. that's it!!!! so, there's hick jane, there's bitch debater jane, and then there's wonderful excited and overly spontaneous/smiley/frog on morphine jane. ;-) rememeber that?  oh WHOOPS! dude, get online, and remove the automatic signin from ur mom's aim at work cuz i just went crazy on her and told her all this stuff and she just replied "i am yue's mother." good thing i didn't say anything........incriminating lol.  i dunno why i am so hyper, i didn't sleep till 2.30, got up early this morning, and bennet spent the whole day making fun of me for my lethargy and "bahbah" spent the day coo-ing at me for it.  anyway....................  casblanca is still a damn good movie. still not as good as forrest gump though. i wonder, is there really a greenbeaux, alabama? hummers........................  not much else to say. working on debate. still not gonna get turned in tomorrow though. me and eleanor will tell rach: yah, we promise we're done, we just forgot ot bring hte file, it's on her dresser!   join cx damn you! lol u can be meena's partner if she decides to stay, or raghu's if he decides to do it at all.  is sunday good for y'all? going out i mean. i'm about to call you and meena and rags to verify so ima go now................  je vous aime!  jane

      ooohh!!! so  thats  how you got it to change. i was about to say, whoever made that template sure has a worse sense of style than Vogue Living. hahahahaha. lol but that's GREAT. omg ur right, the tomato theme could so work....html aye? *cough* you just go ahead and do that, i'll stand aside and not screw things up. ;-)  anyway, wow so who's the vague one now? lol. so what's up.....the lack of details is getting to me. srry about that phone thing today, but you know how psycho my mother is.   just got back from josh's house. ok, not just but basically the lack of a life goes on. we rented casblanca....it was nice! it's a good movie, i thought it would end just as dismally as that other classic 50's movie, Gone With the Wind, but you know what, it was good. cept i feel sorry for all the "bigger people" out there, who never get rewarded with simplicity and ease. hmmm..hmm...hmm.....i feel like doggie number #3. oh, and his dad kept coming in the room. lol it's alright when eleanor is there, she doesn't care but the asian-jewish parent who comes in to check on you is not exactly the same.  going to work tomorrow......arg.........  speaking of the zoo, robby, rob, and chris came by in the middle of the movie. so it's THAT chris!!!!! wow, how serendipitous that i knew him too....(from band, the great melder of cliques). so that just makes rob that id ont know. lol but he seems nice, he was wearing lovely swim trunks to match his hawaiian theme for the day. robby seemed a little starved for attention.....poor guy so that's what it is. lol he's alright.  well my dad just barged in the room and told me to go to sleep so this is to be continued.............................  ps josh reads this too.

      congrats on making your continental breakfast jane!  yea... *sigh* the summer doldrums... rags says he needs a time and place for our "outing". call me  HP5 is progressing... although very slowly. cuz i start reading it at like 11 pm and i drift in and out of sleep while reading.  yay! it's raining!!! i see huge flashes of lightning (like those in cartoons that make the x-rays) but somehow the sound of rain against the window pane is still comforting... ahh now is THE time to curl up w/ my terry cloth blanket and read HP... but alas i'm in the computer chair blogging!  i woke up at 1 today due to that weird dream...   oh gawd... what is that thing they tell u about lightning and thunder and how you can tell when it's close to you? cuz now i just heard the thunder like as it was flashing... i believe i'm dangerously close to it... so being on the comp maybe not be such a good idea... eee  oh about the garish orange color... i tried to make the margin green so it could be the tomato theme... but as of yet (obviously) the template has not cooperated. i will figure it out. surely but slowly (i could read my mom's html book if i get really desparate)!

      summer's dismality has set in. i think it's really similar to the atrophy of winter break cept now i'm too unfocused to not notice.   possible solutions? - work on debate (assignemtsn are due this sat after all) - eat (we all know i need to tr harder) - start practicing clarinet again - piano once more? (NOO!!! torture for everyone's ears, plus angry frustration turned homicidal rampage for me) - sit on the couch and watch more movies (ugh) - try to get into the zoo (and redeem my black sheep status) - get out more and try to have a life outside of eleanor and josh. (how so when nobody else either goes to rice all week or cant get out either)  hmm........oh well. events for today............  i got up today at 11 (woohoo! somebody called me at 10.30 but my mom didn't know who. damn i should have gotten off my lazy ass).  decided to do a little self-indulgence with the soccer mom/eating thing. i made myself - chocolate smoothie - scrambled eggs (4) - pancakes ( 8) - toast (2 slices) - instant sausage (2)  of course, i got all the condiments: ketchup for the eggs, butter for the toast and pancakes, jelly for toast, sat down to eat and watch LOTR once more......and then i just lost it. its half an hour later. eggs are eaten, half a slice of toast is gone, while the beautiful pancakes and sausage are just sitting there......getting cold.......i should take a picture. like in the filter song. actually stuff i make never turns out this good so i really ought to. but anyway, point is, i got sick of eating, i got bored of the movie after watching boromir try to exploit frodo in a desperate rage, and now i'm online. reading debate yahoo group emails like a pathetic loser. and i can't even go out cuz its raining madly, the sky looks horrible, and i have tons of other stuff i should be doing.  *sigh* plans for today - call salem ASAP. no wait, better yet, email him. call tomorrow....??? or next week. procrastination pattie strikes once more. - practice clarinet. i might as well indulge myself. - do a little debate work. thank goodness rach sent us another way to get into lexis. sorry josh, you just have a little more integrity than i do. but that's a good thing. ;-)  wow my life is boring. grrrrr. maybe i should go take a rain jog. haha my parents would absolutely love that. i need to find my poncho...........the rains getting loud. spec-fucking-tacular.  i'm so bored.  sorry about ur allergies, yue. it sucks to ahve the sniffles.......ewwww. computer paper. now THAT sucks. what are u on again? allegra?  nice change of colors, but isn't he garish orange clashing with the baby blue? lol it's ok. how did u do it? maybe we can fix it so that it has a tangible theme.  eek....one more month. sorry.......but i've heard that same story before. *sigh* maybe we can get our braces off together.........in 3 months. hahaha.  u know what i'm going to do? put on some angry music to drown out the rain noise (it's not happy rain noise like usual, it's angry rain noise and i think my computer is getting equally as pissed at me.........illegal ops up the schizza), and work madly on debate. WOOHOO!!!!!   i miss calamity jane. :-( how's HP5 going? love ya lots...................  ms. zhou

      well i suppose i have some making up to do for my absolutely dismal posts the last few weeks.  zoo went....dismally. i suppose my insensitivity (or what josh lovingly calls getting over stuff easily) made me not feel it as much as some other ppl, but well basically i came late as always with carly, and we spent the morning together while the "chosen clerical" went over to the commisary to do their thing. i didn't care much, since i much prefer info booth to washing thousands and thousands of grapes for the birds, and honestly and truly we got stuff done. and had fun all the while.  but then while sheera and tinting   put poor carly! she is such a nice person, and here they are thinking she has changed for the worse and all, when in actuality she is the GREATEST PERSON EVER!!!!!! i mean, shes so fun and jovial and she still gets things done and i can't fucking believe that lauren and yusra and zuhair dont see that. and god bless deb, she is so cool. the COOLEST. EVER!!!!!  so anyway, after a puppet show strike (no thanks to lauren), me and carly go over to the DC on detour to the guard shack, and we make butter. i suppose i shook my jar incompetently and it just turned out as pretty frothy cream so after a demonstration by yue mine turns out - not well, but it turns out. so i refuse salt on advice from yue, and i eat the ritzes. prolly like 4 or 5 which makes me feel a little guilty since im a get some neway but lol ANYWAY......they are addictive. u couldn't even taste the butter. the DC ppl got a kick outa the walking sticks. i miss sarah. and bennet is AWESOME. days w/o barbara....*heaven*. that is the true meaning of theatrical zoocrew. i hope she fullfills her dream, takes some college math, and gets her teaching degree. for everyone's sake. :-D  well basically that was it. went home, and all the stuff happened as yue said.  except, right after zoo we saw raghu and she showed him "the scientist". aftre a condescending glance and a nonchalant "i dont play sheet music like  that ", the subject was dropped after a few attempts to stimulate convo by saying how horrible i was at it. my dad comes shortly thereafter, and so does raghu's mom. in the car, yue is bothered by it a little bit by how insensitive he is being once again. but the subject is dropped, and we go to the music store.  however, i opened up my email this morning and received a rather long, desperate sounding one from rags and realize they must have had a fight about it. *shakes head* u guys will work it out i promise, u always do, but honestly raghu, u should learn something from these experiences. read the reply. and both of u tell me when this is resolved.......i know it will be.   so i played the scientist at HH. wow that's the BEST it's ever been. though i can't control rythyms on either side (or spell rythyms) at least the correct chords were being played in sort of the right places of the melody). but i loved the shiny kiawa!!! damn those stupid overly shiny/yellow buffets.  so we come home, i become impatient, we burn the idiot's guide for yue, josh calls, i wait, josh calls again, we go, and i am happy but really anxious and the results of the day.  really i am sorry for the both of u if the day turned out as dismally as i fear it has.  (OH GOD!!!! I AM WATCHING SOAPS RIGHT NOW........THE WRONGNESS OF IT ALL!!!!!!!)  anyway...i'm so sory!!!! i really am. i wasn't sure how the compatibility of it all would work out, despite the success with eleanor, bc i mean yue is really watching out for me bc of what's happened before, and i know that really did come out as resentment, and i know josh's being a senior, not too talkative, didn't work out well..  but i love you BOTH! so much!!! yue you are like my twin, my best friend, and i love you for watching out for me!! but trust me when i say, that i know what i am with doing with josh. i suppose you are right, the feelings aren't exactly as strong as with jason (but anyway those feelings were both false and wasted), but this is REAL. i love him. and he loves me. and even though u think i am doing this merely bc i need someone (anyone u think), he is the  someone  that i need with me.   and the lulls...well i can't say that was the best of days. but it doesn't matter. i just love being with him at all.......i love finding out things about him, i love when i telll him things about myself, and i am sure as soon as we have more in common (friends, classes, clubs, grade level?) then the lulls will stop. but it's ok. we've talked about lulls before, and it's good. it really is. the convent in france will have to wait.  oh right, well anyways i'm sure u have the whole ER situation good. i never ended up going to the ER, but like half an hour after you left my dad came back and he at least called the ER, and after some "is it really necessary to bring her in?" stuff they were just like.....whatever u unfeeling asian parent there's nothng we can do anymore. *rolls eyes*. but it was alright, by that time, i suppose the benadryl had kicked in and the itching wasn't the eternal fires of hell anymore, and i was so tired from being so tense i just went to sleep. yep, on the couch.   but MAN i am so pissed off. i almost wish you had driven me to the ER, but yah that woulda been really really weird. i love you for offering though, and i appreciate you SOO much. but bejesus.....  ok, in yue' words, my mom is the typical asian: she'll do something, as long as it doesn't have to do with beaucracy or paperwork etc etc. she prolly actually woulda driven me if it was just me and her.  but my dad. omg...sometimes (most of the time) i think he is the rational one. after all...he drives on highways, made me start playing hte clarinet and quit piano, fought for me so hard to go to bellaire desp potential zoning issues and my flings with both debakey and HSPVA. and he was the one who yelled at my counselor, drove me to all those debate tournaments....wait a minute.  speaking of debate tournaments, he was the one who essentially blamed my not qualling on myself, first and foremost, despite the fact that he had never seen me debate before, i went against crosby A who wanted it so bad they made a new aff, lost the coin flip, and was basically running on an empty tank cuz id been there till midnite both days. -_-  so he is schizo. truly and honesty schizo. suppose he puts me on ther ight path to life. but what happens when he wants me to take a detour and i think otherwise??????   i wonder about my parents sometimes. which makes me realize why my friends are my real family. *sigh*  ya lublu tebya te amo yo te amo WO AI NI and  ani ohevet othach!!!!!!!!  i love you guys so much.  jane

      after zoo yesterday, we (jane and i) went to the music store to pick up her stuff. we browsed through the piano section to find a "quiet" one so she can play "the scientist" for me. the beginning chords actually sound correct, but when she started to play the melody on her other hand, she couldn't quite control the rythms of both hands.  we went to her house after that. she impatiently waited for josh to call while i read her diay and discovered she's been schizo all her life. haha. and i discovered "the idiot's guide to classical music" (kinda dissapointed though... cuz it's only clips of the actual pieces... hehe i want the full versions!)  we walked over to the park and met josh on the way. i believe my first words to him were "run... away from her!" (we were like 100 yards away from him and jane was talking about how she ran to him the last time... and i felt inclined to yell that... hehe) so i guess i sounded pretty resentful and that was definitely not the first impression i wanted to give to the captain of next year's AC team. but what else could i say? oh well. so what if he's the captain? acceptance into the team shouldn't be determined based on personal bias anyways. so i have nothing to worry about... besides the fact that i can't even take the test properly! haha  we played on swings for a while. despite my warnings... jane decided to get herself stuck in one of those kid swings. so we had some fun getting her out. then she tried to jump from the swing into josh's arms. on her first attempt, she kinda landed on the wood chips at the base of the swing set (josh wasn't paying much attention cuz he thought she wouldn't jump yet) while some ppl drove by and jeered. on her second attempt she made it, but just barely. those stupid ppl drove around again and flicked us off. then she sat in josh's lap (talk about withholding!) and tried to swing. i pushed them, but they were too heavy for the swing to move significantly. they moved to the bleachers to "do their thing" while i messed around in the empty playground. the see-saw thingies were so miniature! and sliding off the tube thing... well let's just say that i was almost the length of it.  i finally walk over to them (i didn't want to disturb them) and find their convo lacking. so we pick up the subject of sports and me and josh have a disagreement on why the vikings sucked last year. we discover that jane has a HUGE developing rash on her hand so we hurry home and take steps to control it: 1)washed vigorously with ivory soap (it actually floats! haha) 2)cover affected area w/ pack of ice 3)calomine lotion and cortisone cream up the shizza! hehe 4)more ice to numb her hand so she won't scratch it  the swelling/redness decreased on her hand, inflammations flared up on the rest of her body. ahh! jane thought she was going to die and that she was suffering condemnation from God. liang called and jane thought it was God for like 5 seconds (she prayed as she had never done in all her life).  i continue reading the diary and discover prevalent themes since the time she was 8: -wanting to be loved and to have someone to love -anger @ parents -thinking she is perfect -wanting to kill ppl and get revenge -schizoness ("HSPVA ROX/SUX!!!!" hahah)  i spent the rest of my time trying to prevent her from scratching herself (you can't trick me!). josh offered to take her to the ER, but that would just be awkward... she shows her rash to her dad and he acts all nonchalantly about it, so we decide to show it to her mom and see if she at least freaks out. she did, and was all paranoid about what caused it. still, her parents refuse to take her to the ER and make her take benadryl. her mom tried to get her to take her precription pills but she's afraid of mixing meds (aspirin+ibuprofen=internal bleeding   i hope you're better now... or at least is still resisting the urge to scratch.   i realized how lucky i am to have found someone with whom i can be myself and speak my thoughts. someone with whom there never needs to be a pretense. someone i can love without regrets.  jane realized that she cares for josh, but not as much as she did for jason. maybe this whole thing happened too soon after jason left. she was looking for someone... anyone to be with. the thought of instability scares her. she's still deliberating whether to end it. i hope the decision you make is because of the right reasons.  your dad was so oblivious at dinner! i mean... he was sitting right there and didn't so much as act like he heard us.  jason is evil, so is josh... for taking advantage of someone so vulnerable... knowing she will take flattery and attention in whichever way she can get it. may they suffer eternal damnation!

      today... was pleasantly surreal indeed (another word for it would be magical ;) )  zoo was schedule-ly as always on monday, cuz of barbara's presence. we tried to do sun and sea at 10 but nobody who was able to come onstage showed up and we just read the story. we practiced for the frog show w/ barbara, but did get to do it in the morning cuz we didn't have face paint. at lunch (lisa, the other girl whose name i don't know, and i finished a crossword puzzle in people magazine! yay! go us! NVM that... you ppl don't know or understand the challenges that lie in actually completing one correctly, obviously... tsk tsk tsk) barbara went home to get more whipping cream and sarah got the acryllic paint. we came back late after lunch though, cuz of the puzzle to find barbara and sarah doing the butter thing. we were also about to do the frog thing, we had our faces painted and all, but lisa said she was hurting so we decided to cancel it and just let sarah do an eagle presentation at the normal 3 o'clock story theatre time. we did, however, sing the song to 2 uncooperating children and show they the model of frog's life cycle (with dead specimens very similar to those in the taxonomy lab.. eckiness...) so we finally washed the paint off in the barn restroom (which had a toilet that flushes prepetually, btw). there was a lot of scraping and peeling (that paint stuck on like glue once dry), but after struggling for 20 min. our faces finally looked human again!  k, none of that was what made today so "pleasantly surreal". it was the after zoo bit of the afternoon that made going to the zoo in the first place worthwhile (did that make sense? oh well... it doesn't matter) thank you for coming despite the heat and what common sense might have told you otherwise. so was it a good day? yes, but only because of those moments of pure bliss. ^_^  so this is the stuff i wrote in my journal thing after coming home (cuz i thought i'd sleep but no such luck):  so i fell asleep in the car while thinking about rags. when it came time for me to wake up (we got home) however, my dreams were about ron and hermione and i could hear chevelle's send the pain below in the background (the car radio). the first thing i notice when i got out of the car is that the edges of my socks were wet (we went through the misting thing in the park... twice) man... when i was getting out of my mom's building we were at a corner and i bent down to deel my socks and bumped into this guy, who was given an unexpected jolt. hehe  i think rags should give you some piano lessons. you need them before you destroy the concept of music for future generations. hahaha but seriously, i don't think that the music is that hard.  anyways... my stomach hurts so i'm going to lie down in fetal position and fall asleep again (i wish someone *wink wink* were here to hold me) ahh... *my insides twist*  which reminds me, we made butter today! *shake it up baby... twist and shout!* it was really fun... the music wasn't too bad either (haha we made the children shake to that disco song... can't really remember which movie it was from) i liked the butter w/o the salt better, cuz i thought the ritz crackers were already sufficiently salted. we barely had enough supplies for everyone, and we ended up have just enough for the last camp group (we had to use "recycled" ones that the ppl before didn't want to keep).  so back to bed w/ my book and the monkey (cuz the real one can't be here... what a shame...)  MANGOES ROCK!!! yea you heard me. i love  Mangifera indica !!! haha enough w/ the melon vs. squash fascination... this is something i actually enjoy eating! hehe

      continuing...  anyways, so risa was overjoyed cuz she finally got the kelly clarkson CD she's been waiting for. and guess who was the angel that gave it to her? yes... your's truly. hahaha so we listened to like 3 tracks from it, and kelly sounds like christina aguilera! i dunno what i would call what they do, cuz it's definitely not vibrato or anything else musically that i can describe. i'll just call it digging, and there's plent of it in both their vocals.  after everyone had seen and been horrified at the tremendous amount of calories and fat grams they were consuming by eating the chips (yes jane, there was distorted body image up the schizza; i mean, even weimeng was on a diet! gawd... i don't understand these ppl... *shakes head*), ppl kinda split up (i guess?). liang and kristy called their respective ppls; felona and xin played ping-pong; weimeng, lilly and wanjun played VC (btw, do you how to play that game? cuz everyone says it's a chinese game or something b/c only chinese ppl get it. but i don't get it!!! arg). but they all came downstairs to watch "just married" i thought it was a dismal excuse for a movie, even though the ending was all sweet and aww-inducing and such, but you can only take so much of ashton kutcher's stupidity, you know??? the second movie we watched was "spirited away", and all that i can say about it is that i missed the first 20-30 min. of it and i didn't get the rest of the 2 hour long movie. it was creepy though, and that was surprising of an animated film.  so we had cake (again with the distorted body image!), very good cake, and ppl started filing away and leaving in pairs.  i come home worried about where jane went (she didn't come home until 11:30... you'd think your parents would have more sense than to let you stay out like that... begeezus   so i'm glad nothing drastic happened. and i hope it never does. i also hope you and rags "settle" your dispute... only this time i'm not walking in 110 degree weather to rice only to hear a worthless debate while realizing how irritating he was acting that day.

      i'm listening to jane's horrific butchering of "the scientist" on piano (her keyboard) now. it is beyond belief. i mean, she's had it for 2 hours and still can't figure out the chords (which are 4 just alternating and repeating)! she's leaving her sentences half unfinished cuz she can't do two things at the same time. she'll never be able to get violin, or play this song successfully to josh either... that is if she doesn't get her badly needed lessons soon. so apparently she has problems shifting or something. i hope guitar isn't nearly as terrible for me.  and at risa's party: which jane conveniently missed, if you didn't already know. it was basically like the 8th grade party before we all went to the dance.  to be continued later... perhaps ;)

      why haven't you been posting? i know u read it cuz u quoted it earlier, but oh wells. i guess there is really just one prob: there's not much to say. school is over, we're asian, so there really isn't anything going on...  oh how's this. what was risa's party like? sorry i couldn't make it. i felt sort of crappy bc the whole week i'd been wondering what i should have done, whether i should go or not. yes yes, u have every right to hte me bc i said i would come but i'm reaaaaaaalllllyyyyyyy sorry! i didn't have time to get a present anyway and by the time i left UH it was alrady 5.30. and besides i haven't talked to her in like FOREVER and i dont know anything that's going on with that click......  oh wow. i am getting defensive. how horrible. *sigh* i'm sorry. if it makes u feel any better, eleanor and naeem came along with me and josh on our little anniversary.  how is "the order of the phoenix" coming along.....the cover looks dismal but since we went to that party i feel like getting back in the potter groove. haha, but i think now i am going to go get the book bc my little HP1-4 collection is going to get reeeaaaally lonely. but u know me, i prolly wont. plz lend it to me when ur done...i would still like to see how verbose jo's writing is getting, someone told me there was snogging in this book. how risque. anyway.......  i played DDR on sat at uh. only for like an hour after lunch, but WOW we have been missing out. it's not that bad, it's actually pretty fun. but i guess it's one of those things u have to be "in the mood" for. like studying for bio. there was this senior who went to HBU there and he was helping me out along with matt and eleanor (who eventually ditched me lol) and he was nice.....but maybe he's a little too into it. the ddr, and me. maybe i am too nice, eleanor told me i was talking to him too much, but anyways he asked me out to some mexican restuarant. not too blatantly but it was one of those "so ur here every weekend huh? do u like mexican? oh there's this great place on 59.....maybe we could go there after ur done sometime." things. weird weird weird. yue, be glad ur not in CX......  JOSH!!! PLLEASE JOIN DEBATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  yue, what is ur comment on my eating and sleeping habits?  love u lots  tell rags to call me. and that he is a stupid wimp. until he calls me. ciao  calamity jane  ^ eleanor's name for the hick in me. i tried it out on ppl. it didn't go over so well. but it's addictive. come to think of it, even debater jane has a rather noticeable accent. thanks for bringing it out.....hahaha.

      i'm sooooo glad everything is ok for u. glad it worked out, it would have been horrible if it hadn't. but it has, and everything is better. this has been very healthy. i am so glad for both of u. u guys are both really really awesome friends, and if i didn't have you, (or if ur phones were off AND busy *cough*) then i wouldn't know what to do.  love you guys soooooo much.  oh but guess what......the newsletter is finished. *whew* thank goodness. i got to skip half of the theatrical day, but i'm sure barbara is pissed off now bc 1) we barely did anything this morning and 2) we were gonna to an actual puppet show in the afternoon and i'm sure she wouldn't want to screw with "mr sun and mr sea". jeez.  on the bright side, josh's parents found out about us. they are still rather civil to me, especially his dad, but they give him such a hard time about my being a goy.   on the even brighter side, my parents are suspecting as hell bc apparently eleanor called when i was gone and guess where i was? not at home. maybe she isn't either, bc she didn't come to the zoo today *cough* but anyway i said i walked around meyerland myself but that's a little bit unbelievable bc i was gone for two hours. they kept bugging me about if i was really by myself but i think they are just going to block out hte possibility that i was bc then they were just like "go call claire". speaking of which......  claire from TPP wants to interview me for the cardinal camp issue. *SCORE* i rock. lol.   it's actually been a good day. didn't do anything this morning, was in my forte in the afternoon (not really, apparently unedited, unrevised jane writing sucks monkey balls, even zuhair's mom said it was pathetic, and all my articles were "finalized" by lauren and yusra), and i cried when it finally came outa hte printer. i was about to murder zuhair though bc he wanted to keep moving the pics, and stuff like that. *ahhh* co-editorship. non-theatricalness. the shizziness continues.  so when i got home, i saw josh's dad on the street. weird glances exchanged. when i got to my room, my dad asked me if i was going to sleep and eat. i said no to the sleeping, but i did eat just a little bit.  two bottles of water drunk today...i am proud of myself.  the restlessness continues until 6. and he calls. and he is depressed. now i am worried. i run over and find he is still depressed. so i  am  the optimist in this relationship.  it's alright. he came out of it alright.   but then again i have been not myself lately. not as "gregarious" as i usually am. must drink more coffee...must eat more....must sleep more. all happening. next week? hmm prolly not. haha jk jk....of course it's happening. *shifts eyes*  love all you guys, the frisky one

      to rags: if you are reading this and feel like shit, don't. it's not that i don't love you anymore, because i do with all my heart. it's just that some of your habits seem more and more annoying and that is something i cannot ignore. something else i can't ignore is that there is nothing you can do to change yourself. not now. so please just give me time and space to think things through, let me decide whether it's worth it.

      i plan on taking a nice long nap when i get home. then wake up at 10 to think through some things. if my mom lets me (she insists on following me everywhere and inspecting everything i bring into the house), maybe i'll go see finding nemo by myself sometime.  i'm sorry if i've neglected my duty as friend for the past... i dunno... 4 months? a lot of time that i'll prolly never finish catching up on. a lot of time perhaps wasted with the wrong person.  so starting tomorrow, i'm gonna see who's actually home if i call during the day (gawd you ppl are so occupied! kinkaid, rice, testmasters, swim team... man...) and try to get back in touch w/ y'all. i can't believe you guys still care even though i've been such a selfish ass and neglected everyone.  thank you so much jane! i don't know what i'll do w/o you.

      well now aren't i just a horrible person?  i really can't support you either way on this w/o thinking that one of you is wrong. of course i still believe that you are right, you always are and his reliability is fickle as my heart is trying so hard for its own sake not to be.   do what you have to do. but remember what used to be there. take a siesta. a trip. a date not at meyerland plaza? call me all you want. i'll be there. for both of you. use me all you like. i dont mind.  but take care of urself the most. just try out a situation in ur head before u do anything. and most of all, stop isolating yourself. call me, call liang, call kristy if u feel like it (this one i'm not gonna force or recommend). call eleanor, call meena, call everyone! they miss you, you know. they want you to call.  and never ever forget i'll always be here for u, and support u no matter WHAT you do. if u want me to be judgemental, i will. if u want me to be practical, no shit i will. if u want me to dabble in some bashing, count me in.  be happy. i want you to be happy. i want everyone to be happy. and not ever feel want or need or disappointment.   ps this is hilarious  [jane walks in, robby is sitting and bored] R: hey janey J: hey robby Daniel: haha, you can't do anything to it cuz it's already robby. R: so how do you know josh? J: from AC and stuff, he's great R: would u go out with him? J: well i am R: [looks stunned, eyes open just a little bit wider than usual. silence for a few seconds] i'm going to have to call him.........  why does everyone say they need to call him?  "For Jane"  Restless dreams pervade my sleep And yet there is a calm that clamors in my ears You are something that night does not keep And yet your presence wipes away the tears, Removes the persistent fears, And I fade into sleep.

      thank God you guys worked your thing out. so much for mediating. haha  he called me to say he's not calling tonight (why did i even bother to pick up? it's not like he ever does. i mean, it's not his fault when he's w/ his parents, but when we were trying to find him at lunch in rice??? geez). didn't ask why i've not said anything to him all day (maybe he doesn't care or notice? he'll prolly call you and ask  if  he  did  notice). just told me he wouldn't call. like i care. HA! the only other words he said to me today were "can i talk to jane alone?", "what is the time? (3 times b/c i didn't answer)", and "where are you?" nice. let's hear that again.  man... why couldn't i see this earlier? maybe it wouldn't have happened had i still kept in touch w/ liang and kristy... eek now i must undo this myself.  >_<

      before i forget: rags tells u to do push-ups. once you can do 3000 a day, then you can start weight-training. i think that is HI-larious.  btw, if that doesn't work for you, SWIM.  good luck! ;)

      so  jane has a convulsive heartrate. her resting pulse is in the 100's... *gasps* maybe it's *hint* what happnd yesterday....[jane types heeheehee]. or maybe it's just because i (JZ) have MVP, or prolly bc i am out of shape. really bad. 200 yds and wheezing. serendipitously, it's right when i get to jason. -_- tjhe street fn course. stupid asshole. HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA he's gonna get a kick outa the news.  anyway.......  so we went to the HH today and discovered it was closed. we come and did shizz with our feet....and her teddy bear. and then her mom asked us to entertain a 10 yr old. we played monopoly until jane had serious cash flow probs and mortaged the dark purples to pay rent.  i like jane's teddy bear. so then we went walking, and jane danced like a lephrechaun to avoid hte mosquitos, but ended up with beaouceoup de red on her legs and her mom asks why only SHE got them.   we walked by josh's house but jane was afraid to knock. we see his volvo, and jane explains that her purse is inside with some....."stuff" inside. we also see larissa's house. it is very neat. so.......we come home. and slap on the "clear calamine" lotion. it worked. tried to get jane to lift weights, but she was aching by ten reps, which is really sad. [no it's not!!!!!] so we watched the game for like 5 min, and we checked her email and cleaned it out. got another call....he still hasn't explained what happend.  it's jane now. what the shiz!!!!!!! i just reread all of josh's emails and i now wonder how the crap i could tell.  OOHHHH ELEANOR JUST CAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      ok well basically this post is constructed like a prayer...since it is a sunday morning after all.  Thank you so much.....and not just to my twin who reads this but to EVERYONE...i know now i am quite a handful. me and yue counted last night and just this year alone there were.....42 guys?! *sigh* i'm so sorry, i'm absolutely CRAZY and i can't even believe a person like me EXISTS. if it was me, i'd run away everytime u saw me, or better yet, condemn me as some weirdo sent by satan. (ps i'm not......let's just blame debate :-) ).  and i know this is only one of the things y'all stick by me for, but me being an emotionalist (even after AS believe it or not) , it mattered so much to me to find.....someone. i know that during all that, even though when it got really bad you guys were like "oh geez shut up!" because i was delusional and stubborn and wouldn't listen to anyone or talk about anything else...... but i thank you guys so much for still hoping for me, that i would get over that jerk, open my eyes, and just...basically que sera sera. and now thanks to u guys, i'm not (really) desperate or a slut, and even though i was being all selfish and crap through all that thanks for only being mad, and wanting to help, and not leaving me for lost. and here's the final word: you guys are right. u guys are ALWAYS right. i know with those stupid hemann twins i got brainwashed into thinking i was always right but really....you guys are my family. u know me so well, what i will do, and how to fix me up afterwards when i dont listen. you let me make mistakes, and i know it really hurts u guys to see me let myself get used sometimes (*cough arthur cough*) but thank you for not judging too much and just....helping me forget and forcing me to get better. you guys are ALWAYS right. even now u know i wont always say or do what is right, even what i know is right, and that advice from u is still seldom taken (specially after yue's "dont read" thing...hahaha jk jk. i luv u!) but just know that....i   know   that you guys wouldn't ever unnecessarily hurt me and that you are looking out for me. i love you guys.   keep on helping me out in vain and remember that from now on i will always try harder. for faith's sake. in you guys, in myself, and in the fact that everything works out in the end. i will try to cut down on petty complaining, on what you know to be fake threats of drugs, on blowing u guys off or prioritizing too much, and on trying too hard.  u guys were right once again: i am having hard enuff a time doing everything i am doing now. i wont add lacrosse to my list. and besides....u know all i was doing it for was for cheerleader-like attention and the skirt. i realize now that the attention was unnecessary, the old cliche is true, be urself, and the skirt....welll.......if some store doesn't start carrying those i'll just get lisa to order me one from the catalog.  and on the subject of trying harder, really i think a reason the bam died is cuz we stopped trying. not that it wasn't dead anyway or that i think we should get together, but i think we should just maybe.......try a little harder. in everything. bernadette was right, we did all sort off fall apart, but she doesn't haev to be completely right: we dont have to hate each other. we have to take care of these grudges. as we are all girls or herms, let's just...have some closure.  ok now on to the regular jane stuff:  remarks on yesterday- - yes we DID come...at like two.......... - kyle?? ewwwwwwww...... - i can't believe rags was that late. gosh when he moves to bellaire he could prolly just run there in like 2 seconds.  - *gasp* the dress in the window is beyond GORGEOUS!!! it's BEAUTIFUL!!!!!! ok so what if t's a little 1920's and vintage but that's good dude! i mean..just depends what sort of person  u are. cosmopolitan reporter would wear the one we liked ...........and the jewish geography teacher would wear this one. - srry for that stuff with ur mom. gosh. i hope that nothing happens, and that she remains out of the loop forever and ever so that me and you dont end up getting kicked out of the house and living with eleanor and her crazy habits. (seriously......we were on the phone till like 4 AM last night. maybe just cuz my heart was racing [ the cofee maybe? haha riiiight...] but anyway yah she does that a lot. plus i think i might skip wednesday at the zoo to go to Uh and work since my stupid orthodontist screwed me over. ) speaking of which...... - grr i had the PERFECT weekend planned out, i swear. sat: go to UH, go out with josh, dinner with parents. sun: gt music store, hopefully enjoy this yrs F-day. mon: salem crap.  i dunno though, i guess it really wasn't that big a deal about the orthodontist thing but i didn't get tor esearch.....and eleanor didn't get to meet josh (btw, neither did u lol) and i was horribly horribly late. geez. me overreacting. maybe i care about josh too much? my dad thinks i just love debate a little too much.  - you guys have to see finding nemo! i know i said it was sort of a long feeling movie but it's sooo good.....the plot was good, a little too complex maybe (i know that sounds stupid cuz it's rated G but really.....so many bad things happen to nemo and marlin and dorcey. :_-(   ) but the characters were great and stetreotyped just enuff (and surprisingly us asians and jews can identify with the main conflict of the story - parental domination) to be great and the quotes were awesome. "RIGHTEOUS!!! RIGHTEOUS!!!!!!!" "fish are friends, not food" lol. i wouldn't say see it alone though cuz it gets a little tiring and u need something to distract you all the while of course.  and now on to what you was coming: my day with josh (and the rest).  - at the dentist, after he called, my dad asked "is josh your teacher?"  - a little f-day nostalgia: aww...my dad really does care. he felt really bad about me missing UH and was ready to take me just about anywhere.  - asked my orthodontist what the deal was. he said that i would be off braces by the end of the summer, but that i will have to wear a retainer for a year. at least those come out? geez. tell me how urs are coming along. - i was so pissed when i got home i went to eleanor's for a long while and we sat there and sang along to "i'm gonna fuck you" over and over and over....it's set to a slow country love ballad. it's pretty good though. "that's fucking teamwork!" sorry rags. direct quote. :-) - i think i am seriously a soccer mom. the first thing i did when i got to eleanor's was make breakfast. my eggs are bland but is uppose they are alright with ketchup. at least they wren't burnt. lol. plus when i finally got to meet josh i saw him driving a minivan and i got all excited. - unfortunately i got coffee at borders right before we had lunch at like 3 o clock hahaha. i sincerely hope that's not the reason he did what he did, i can't keep that up. lol. i was all tense and hyper and being all what he calls "spontaneous". ohh but here's a question for ya: why are guys turned on by lesbians, while we aren't turned on gays? i asked eleanor and she cross applied this quote (be quiet!) "men fall in love with their eyes, and women fall in love with their ears". makes sense. i will have to tell josh. it has been bugging him. - the girl from seinfeld's name is elaine, not eileen. that has also been bugging him. - so we had lunch, had a GREAT talk, opened up maybe a little too much? i thought it scared the crap out of him but apparently he likes hearing about jason and arthur and getting turned on by corn and tales of my lesbian experiences. he's a lot more conservative. - u know we have so much in common. it's so much more symmetrical than jason, bc our values are the same. oh geez....we both have asian parents. of course it would work out that way. but we act differently......i told him i thought i was insensitive. he said that i just got over stuff easily and that i would end up living a better life than anyone he knew. awwww....... - i think he prolly thinks i'm bulimic or anorexic or something. he agreed with me in that i'm not skinny, but i ate about 20% of my lunch. and i felt horrible. i blame the coffee.........he brushed it off as me having "hi metabolism" - but apparently this lunch thing really wasn't bc of me per se. he takes a lot of ppl out for lunch for their bdays. wow but any other person would have said happy bday and left it cuz it's so late. he kept making me decide things bc it was my bday but u know hw  i have no spine. patriarchy jokes made galore.  - went to the movie at like 4.20 at edwards. that place is the shiz. i like how the seats have armrests that fold up and down, haha he made a crack about loveseats in the beginning but i let him leave it up.  - pathetically, but luckily i screamed bunches during hte movie. i'm sure he took that as a cue to  put his arm around me to "comfort me" but my brain knew better. haha it was weird tho cuz u know how i have weird body temp things going on and especially cuz i was wearing THAT particular shirt (dont judge, but i wasn't leaving anything to chance so i wore a green halter top) so my back was all hot and sweaty and he was holding my hand too which was ice cold so i'm sure he thinks i'm weird. remember that ears thing at pearland? *whew* - so by the end it's pretty obvious cuz his jokes are getting more and more awww.......and by the end he just asked it very nicely and me being the total insensitive loser said "sure!" really hyperly. no wonder he was so freaked out..... - because later in the car it turns out he was worried about my saying yes for the wrong reasons bc apparently he is quite the debater and has done some digging and heard about my not saying not to stuff. but it's a good thing i brought up obsessions tho bc then i told him i had been like obsessed with him for weeks and he was like "oh good, so it WAS mutual".  - btw, who had ms. brison? - btw again....all u guys try out for AC seriously. i dont know why they ever thought letting will on was a good idea. he doesn't work! travis is alright despite being a soph AND a football player but will.......doesn't try. he gets by on what he's got. - so anyway by the time we outa the movie it's exactly 6.17 (how senredipitous...look at ur last post) and i am late for dnner. he takes me back to his house bc i have no keys (or so he thinks...haha i didn't want to go home) and i meet his family...or the non at college part anyway. his brother zach goes to lanier, just graduated 8th grade. btw....i think PMS won homecoming this year!! WOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! his dad works for ChevronTexaco and is very smart and nice. his mom was a biology teacher (AP) and is a very good conversationalist. they are nice people. our type can identify. asian, democratic, and opinionated. yay! like i said....same value system........but of course i'm sure they noticed i was asian. like really asian, not jewish - they were going out to dinner and invited me. gosh i was so freaked out bc of all the stories he has told me about them and dating Gentiles. i asked him if everything was alright when we left the restaurant bc i sort of swore once and they didn't like it but then i turne don the 45 year old charms and talked about politics and the education crisis in this country. slick aye?  - josh said they prolly didn't think we were going out because i was so young. yah...at dinner there was a big deal made of me and josh being at opposite ends of the spectrum, his bday is at the beginning of the yr so he is old, and mine is at the end so i am young anyway. so he's a really old guy, and i'm a really young girl. like i said, he was freaked out about my being 15. aww but he explained it as my being very mature. i am going to believe him. - his brother's doing debate. RIGHTEOUS!!!!! - but then when we drove home, he parked the car, and we just got out and took a walk and didn't come back home until 9 (which makes a good hour of walking and doing....other things) when my parents overtook us on Jason coming back from dinner. so i thought i was screwed in a few ways. 1) for wearing that halter top w/o a sweater on. 2) for being out when it was dark. 3) for being out with someone they thought was my teacher. 4) for being out with my teacher and doing THAT in the dark, with a halter top on.  but they are obviously more oblivious than anyone thought, cuz they didn't notice, smiled, and even gave him a ride home. later that night my mom came into my room and stared at the AC pic on my wall at josh. she was smiling. when my parents approve......SCARY. but i'm sure they dont know he's jewish. - so i suppose that's it. oh right....when i got home i was about to bust cuz of all the coffee i had (no more lattes for me, i think i need plain coffee from now on) and cuz of all the lovey dovey stuff and i didnt sleep till two and i got up this morning at 7.  - i think i can settle down now, no more guy chasing for me. but i couldn't stop thinking about the future last night before i finally fell asleep for 2 hours. wow....a SENIOR. a jewish senior. he says i am too intoxicating to give up and he can't imagine a breakup. i was so offeneded when u said last night it would be over before xmas. lol jk jk i luv u still. but then that means.....prom? i think that striped black and white dress is gonna go get a run for its money. but what scares me the most is what he is going to have to tell his parents in the end. they are not as....u know about that so he plans to eventually tell him. oh gawsh. think i can score one with the parents too? - ok maybe the parents isn't the most scary thing. the scariest, and coolest thng is that we are on AC together. but that will just be weird cuz i dunno if any two ppl have ever been together before. especially.......the long shot new member and the captain? freaky up the shizzo. haha, i can only imagine AC outings.............  ok but here it is. i promise i wont be jenny and phil. this is good.......it's not like i would u know run away.....he just...already fits. *ahhh* wow but he WILL be a pfile in october. i still can't get over that.  and i still can't get over how easy it was. u guys are right yet again. good things happen easily. and they just happen.   i love you guys so much! Je t'aime beaucoup! Te amo! Yo te amo! wo ai ni men! Ya lublu tyebya!   wow this is a long ass post.  took an hour too.  life is peachy......  jane  ps on other things, the zoo is getting steadily more disappointing, u are right. pps stress really is a good anti drug ppps visit to rice on tuesday pppps join model UN please!!!!!!!! please!!!!!!!!!  ppppps i feel better than i ever have before. it's like the missing piece in my eiffel tower puzzle is found. except he hates the french. hahaha. its funny how he coutns me as french. well with paul gone they are all screwed cuz idunno that much and i am slow. pppppps i feel bad about the captain cabangbang (josh's nickname for him) situation. i'll cal him later. i promise.

ARGNESS... i don't feel like seeing a movie anymore... and i don't want to wait until 4 for him to get here... >_  and what do you know? he showed up like 1 min after i finished that sentence! ^_^  so we decided not to see the movie afterall (the ones showing at the time were bleh-ish) and walked over to borders. i showed him the polar bear card at hallmark and also the fugly wedding dress they have the in the display at bridesmart now. even he agreed... it was SOOOO 1920's. haha  so we are getting a light-colored labrador retriever someday. we looked at pics of them today. the puppies were awwness! i want a lab puppie and have it stay that way forever! they are so soft and cuddly! :)  there was this voodoo doll book w/ the doll and the pins and everything. they called it "the most effective anger management tool" or something. haha  i want to go to australia! it's so perty... hehe  i bit the finger... 2 times!

      an email i got from jane. probably the most meaningful one i've received in days. none of that "make a wish and if you send it to 10 ppl it'll come true" crap. just a nice little thought provoking (maybe?) forward:   Five lessons to make you think about the way we treat people.    1.   First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady.   During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until I read the last one: "What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?"  Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.  "Absolutely," said the professor. "In your careers, you will meet many people.  All are significant.  They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say "hello".  I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.   2.   Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain   One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride.  Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s.  The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab.  She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him.  Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door.  To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home.  A special note was attached.  It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along.  Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others," Sincerely, Mrs.  Nat King Cole.   3.   Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.   In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table.   A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.  "How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked. "Fifty cents," replied the waitress.  The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.  "Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired.  By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.  "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied.  The little boy again counted his coins.  "I'll have the plain ice cream," he said.  The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away.  The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left.  When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table.  There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies.  You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.   4.   Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacles in Our Path.   In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway.  Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock.  Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.  Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables.  Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road.  After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been.  The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.  The peasant learned what many of us never understand!  Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.   5.   Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts.   Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare & serious disease.  Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year-old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness.  The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister.  I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, "Yes I'll do it if it will save her." As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks.  Then his face grew pale and his smile faded.  He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, "Will I start to die right away?".  Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.   ”Work like you don't need the money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like you do when nobody's watching."   NOW more than ever - Peace...May God bless you.  Pass It On...Pay It Forward

      i feel so left out:  1) jane called rags before she called me. not that she ever did call me. 2) i don't know russian so i can't make up a secret russian code language w/ my twin. or understand what "ya lublu tyebya" means either. 3) i'm not chummy w/ abe so i cannot dig, even if that's the one thing i would like to do now. 4) i haven't heard from the kinkaid ppl in decades. where are you risa? liang? 5) i don't get anything that the rice ppl talk about. 6) even at the zoo (the most welcoming/accepting of places), i'm in theatrical while jane gets to work in schizzy clerical.  so i'm stuck in my own little bubble. this IS fan-freaking-tastic.  PS. jane's phone is busy. she better be calling him now.

      so that didn't work out. wimped out. called meena. 3 wayed abe. he was busy. it was a foreshadowy thing. i hate it. if we did end up getting together i think that it owuld just not work out. he's so busy. he's got so many friends. and so many other things to do. and i dont think he wants to make me a very big priority. not that i blame him. but it just wouldn't work out. but i will still call him after he gets back from the gym.  in other news........  the zoo is being really stupid. i mean i really miss last year. if yue thinks theatrical is horrible and clerical is the shiz, then i think she woulda loved last yer. it was so cool......there was none of this stupid interpretative stuff. it was actually EDUCATIONAL. like who wouldn't wanna know not to feed the animals. deb says we maybe do some puppet shows in the BEC. we have puppets after all. and what else sucks is that everyone is so factioned now. there's too many people now so that we have to do really stupid things like inventory the adopt an animal stuff, and now we dont even get to know each other bc we are all so sectioned. if we had an office last year it woulda been the shiz but now it's just so horrible bc all hte old ppl hang out and hte new ppl are just.....not in clerical. except for nikka but sh'e kindaa out of it.  all for now. done complaining. have to make up a thatical day on monday... yay!!!! fun with yue.  anyway..... hope the berverly hills stuff works out. raghu says that show is the shiz. i think u''ll be interested in knowing that he also suggested i pee on the floor. -_- what a horrible joke.  jane   wanted: an older nurturing man. key word nurturing. implies not minding spending time with me. sheesh.  ps i had a dream about being jewish.

      well isn't this fan-freaking-tastic. i am having a lovely day because i called in sick to barbara so i got to sleep till 3, ate in my PJs, and then was online for a very very long time. doing things i really like to do, that i should have been doing for a reallyr eally long time. checking email, replying to josh (who happens to be the only non-business email i get anyway), uploading pics, and finally writing in the blog. and then i sign into IM and raghu the wonderful pops up, and says "CALL HIM!!!!!!! he told me to tell you to CALL HIM!"  which makes me want to go into a coma for a few days bc i hadn't been planning on doing that until this weekend. and why? because now i have a situation on my hands. ok ok, i know most people wouldn't consider this a situation by any means but I LIKE JOSH TOO!!!! he's absolutely great, everything that abraham is, plus 2 years. and i know that's a very pointles 2 years since they are both great but it's me!!!! it's JANE! who likes seniors! and of course i know that most of all liking josh is pointless because..........  "When I said "wait," I meant I don't ask anyone out nor truly express an interest in anyone. Of course, there are one or two I'd ask out if I were in a different situation, but they are non-Jewish. "So, I wait." Also, it's not like girls are knocking down my door anyway.."  and yet, we are still going to lunch and a movie this weekend. a nice friendly time except that he is great, and so is abraham. i could have gotten it figured out this weekend. and i could have gone to see finding nemo with abe on sunday and everything could have been perfect.  but now it's thrusday, and i have to call abraham right after i am done posting and i dont know what i'll say, or if i'll want to say it ON THE P HONE.  Jane the Frustrated  ps sorry if i sound so horribly sarcastic and pissy but yah it's abraham and if i do something wrong then so much of the good from my freshman year will leave me forever.  pps russian really is easy......  ya lublu tyebya!

      FYI: on sunday as we were driving over to pick up meena, my dad asked me if there was going to be food at jane's party... and also if he could eat it. today he suggested that we go out to eat on fathers day b/c he's been a father for 14 years and deserves recognition. HA! i doubt he did anything for mom on mother's day.

      so yesterday: -barbara was sick so when i came in the morning, i saw a deserted DC and after lisa came was told to go to the BEC to wait for sarah to come at 9 -we are assigned "projects" at the BEC and when lia tried to contact sarah, since she didn't sign in at the BEC, no one was there, sooo... -we sit in the education office and ponder on what "N" could possibly stand for on barbara's animal alphabet thing -we sit in the visitors booth w/ 10 postcard selections (i went crazy... hehe) and scare the ppl on their way to the bird show -we go back to the DC to get our lunches and discover that sarah had been there all the while, we decide to go back after lunch -sarah gives us a preview of her "zoo hits" (today's chart-toppers the zoo-style... Ex-in da club turns into in da mud) haha it was hilarious! -after zoo is over, i turn on my cell to find a message from a certain someone ;) -i meet up w/ rags (longer hair) in front of the zoo and we walk to my mom's office building... but i get no hug! :'(  anways, today: -lisa and i wait for someone to show up while we knock on the DC office door and hope that someone will come and save us -sarah shows up at 8:25ish, just before the 8:30 deadline that we set before we were walking over to the BEC -sarah's still waking up, so we go to the BEC to get her some coffee and pick up our uniforms on the way -benett shows up and he makes sarah do 4-5 sets of 20 push-ups -after that, we shop for sarah's new shoes and debate which ones she should get (the red 'roos or the yellow/silver addidas? the yellow/silver or the green/yellow?). in the end i think she decided to get both the silver and the green. haha -i eat lunch in the conference room w/ the nice chairs and carly (who calls jane and i dorks. rightfully so. hehe), yusra, zuhair (wearing baggy pj-ish pants!), and jane (who aspires to become a secretary/intern [who gets paid]) -i return to the DC and finish my day w/ the kids that NEVER get tired! -oOo! we made up this new game for the older children. it involves those multi-color animal shapes (in the yellow plastic container in the right cabinet above the sink) and a sausage. basically, it's a twist on bowling. instead of having them knock all the animals down w/ the sausage, we had them knock down all except the red pig (from which sausage comes from) or had them only knock down the green ones, the horses... etc. you get the gist of it. the only disad. was that some kids got violent ("she's killing the pig!" ) but what can you expect in a world where toddlers listen/sing to in da club?  btw, is there a game today?

      since jane is soooo stubborn and won't do what she is told *cough*, i'll blog (somehow that word just seems so barbaric/crude!) about yesterday's happenings:  let's just start w/ my mad rush to get to meena and the party on time. well you all know about my procrastination habits and how sometimes it can be quite extreme (kristy knows about that english project ;) ). so i'm home, and jane calls me to make me RSVP for her party when it strikes me, i have no gift! so i try to reach my dad, who is submerged in his "work" at his office and he tells me he's coming home soon, which by asian parent standards could mean anytime between today and next week. after 3 calls, he comes home, an hour after the first call. nice, huh? so it's 4:20 and i've only just begun to make jane's gift. how dead was i? x_X i did finish it, though (i FORGOT to GIVE it to her!!! ARGNESS!!!), at around 5ish, when i had to go pick meena up. after arguing w/ my dad on whether the street #s were increasing or decreasing, we find meena and alessia. apparently, meena's mom said she couldn't come, so only alessia gets in the the car. 2 min later, when we're on Bellaire, meena calls and says she can come b/c her mom changed her mind(what is w/ the indecisive indian parents?). so we go back to meena's house and get her, go to the zoo (after semi-yelling back and forth between my dad and i; sorry about that) and meet up w/ jane, eleanor (who we all thought was asleep cuz all our calls were going to the answering machine), dima (the first to get there for some reason; he thinks he was just being prompt), liang and her bro, kristy, sobiya (she could've been a hemann triplet! haha but she went to DeBakey. *gasp*), jenni and phil.  aftering everyone cooled down w/ hawaiian shaved ice, we walk over to where jane, eleanor, and her parents are sitting w/ the food. rags calls and says that he'll sing happy birthday to jane, but doesn't do it cuz there are ppl around him. so jane's dad pulls out the butchers knife (which i've had too close an encounter w/, btw) and cuts the fudge cake that jane made for herself. i must say, that was pretty good frosting! hehe. we then progress to the pizza and the "garlic dipping sauce" (i think it was just oil... it looked kinda nasty). we got to watch ridge (liang's 'lil bro) act like a duck! awww-ness! so then some ppl (meena and kristy) had to leave, and some other ppl (jane and liang) left to walk them home. in the meanwhile, the ppl who stayed behind took out the bread and started to feed the fish/ducks. it's scary how the fish will congregate wherever you drop the bread and all jump to grab it. it's equally frightening how the meat-eating ducks will just swim by a feeding school of fish and attack the fish (at first we didn't know what it was doing, cuz it seemed like it was trying to get the bread, but then we realized that by feeding the fish we were only helping the ducks catch them). so dima still hasn't fully explained what all that stuff oozing to the water's surface is. i swear he said it was methane, but then he goes and tells me it's CO2. grrrr  there was this really badly sunburned pfile near the lake. he was telling us to put bread between our toes so that the fish could nibble at it and just stared at us while dima tried to get a fish in the cup. he wasn't successful, of course, b/c he basically thrashed his arm and the cup in the water and scared all the fish away. he tried a trap sort of thing by putting bread into the cup and then submerging it, but the fish knew better than to swim in. he also kicked a duck into the water and pretended like he only "shoved" it. ha! alessia tried to sink some fish w/ her densely packed breadballs, and also speculated on how a dropped cigarette butt might affect the fish (stone them). anyways, after we ran out of bread for the fish, we walk around and discover a duck being drowned/raped by another duck. so we start throwing things at them to make the other duck stop, and are temporarily successful, but that other duck chases the victimized duck around, and eventually goes back to doing whatever he was doing again. when all was said and done, the victimized duck had been raped by 2 ducks... she'll need some serious psychological counseling sessions.  so jane's mom finds a lost baby duck, and the awwing insues. the pfile guy tells us to go look for its mother, since she can't be that far away. jane hears rags' voicemail message where he actually sang! we find the mom w/ like 10 other ducklings swimming in the pond by the lilies but the lost duckling has something wrong with its neck and can't swim, so we can't release her onto the water. we try to get the mother duck's attention, but she just swims away. so our last resort is to get the baby duck to the animal clinic in the zoo. so we walk up to the fence by the guard shack, where this guy is feeding the ducks in the zoo, and we pass the duckling through the fence, where hopefully he has been fed and treated. we walk back through the children's playground area, and everyone swings while trying to kick their shoes off in dima's direction. fun fun. we try to go through the misting thing, but only the bottom sprayers are on, so we only feel the water by our feet. finally we just decide to jump in front of the lawn sprinklers.   so we all get separated into jane's cars. i went w/ her dad and alessia. i thought i was going to jane's place (b/c my dad wants to watch the game and NOT come pick me up! *GRRR!!!*), but her dad decides to drop me off at home cuz i'm on the way to alessia's house anyways. yay! :) so i go home and watch the horrific game. 33-30 at halftime?!?!? you've got to be kidding me. so i've discovered that the fingers thing we do isn't exclusive to our bellaire ppl anymore, i mean, i saw kenyon martin do it w/ his coach! *gasp jane gasp* hahaha  it was a good day yesterday 'cept for that little thing that few need to know of. i listened to some of the songs on the cd before i went to sleep as i was memorizing my lines for barbara. i think i suffocated the monkey cuz i was hugging him so hard... :)

      NOTE: WE PROLLY SHOULDN'T READ THIS AT HTE ZOO ANYMORE; OR WHEN ROBBY IS AROUND ANYWAY.  *sigh*  i really dont feel fifteen. and feel is supposed to be italicized but italics doesn't work here for some reason even tho there's a button/html command for it. anyway....  yah, so anyway i dont feel fifteen. i feel 14 and very adolescent-y, not teenagery. i suppose i could now get a job and whatnot but damn i feel so insignificant and YOUNG! sheeeesh. lol  well, it was a pretty nice b-day. on account of hte rain, the picnic is being rescheduled indefinitely, but after the speech test me and mona and bianca went to meyerland, where we met up with the rogers people. u know, i think meyerland is actually pretty nice.....discovered new things to do. but i'm afraid it's sort of a very preppy, non-bring your boyfriend sort of activity. it's not borders.......it's *shopping*! lol. not shoppigng shopping cuz u know how broke i am but mostly just *grab all u want and run to hte fitting rooms* sort of thing. i actually did end up getting something to commerorate my becoming (sort of) a woman but i'm afraid it's very er......ingrid (*cringe*) so i'm not sure you want to know. lol. but i was so mad, i ended up getting green bc all the pretty red ones with the flowery pattern around the neck (hole) were in large...........yeesh. anyway.......  right so, that's the new thing to do at meyerland. ooh and we went to bridesmart! *ahhh* trying stuff on was cool.....(i am SOO wearing either that stripey black and white or hte turqoisey one for prom. if i end up getting an older boyfreidn....phalanges intersected......then i suppose i'd get both. ) but now i can't go there for a really long time or they will remember me and be like what happdn to that party......lol.....  zoo is great. barbara is scary. but she's alright. i need my coffee though.....i couldn't function w/o coffee.....and then when patrick (cute gift/coffee shop guy) called and said he was bringing some over i got excited but then he never came. ima go storm in and ask what happened tomorrow. :-) but then i went later and laura (nice lady at gift shoop) made me a mocha latte anyway. damn yue, ur missing all the drama! haha zoo drama, and wellllll.......  let's get to hte good stuff. chasing down guys at hte zoo.  reflections: - stephen is aparently at hte West Palm Beach Zoo. clarifications later (when i decide to sto being a wimp and ask cassie). u know what.....31 was just a wee bit too far. he's biologically old enuff to be my daddy ! (and not in a weird sexual way hahha) - abraham is probably my soul mate (i can see all our lives being a 90210 sort of thing, and if so then i will marry him after being really screwed up by an older, arrogant guy) but i dont think right now i am feeling a whole lot of you know what. my fault really as you know what MY taste in guys is. older, arrogant, asshole. :-)  so.......what iv'e discovered at hte zoo so far.  - patrick: gift shop. went out with sarah so that would just be weird. pfilia old. worked at starbucks for 6 yrs. does not deliver coffee or keep promises apparently. do i mind? no. - ----: unamed guy at gift shop. *whew* hot as ........... szechuan cooking. (not hte empress kind, hte good kind haha) - robbie: yes....THAT robbie. i'd go out with him. :-) but he's no stephen fisher, as he keeps eluding to him.  i wonder when i am going to get around to the museum to deliver you know what. am i ever giong to give paul his card? who knows.  i love yue and eleanor!!!!! u guys are great. :-) my zoo buddies........seriously yue, clerical is the shiz. even eleanor can't handle theatrical..........lol barbara says you are "shy in some respects but she can really be out there". care to explain? haha.  dont worry about ragie poo.....he wont be rags. and i'm sorry about that ingrid allusion earlier. life is good. it will stay good. and we wont have to worry about a thing bc hte universe loves us. *ahhhh* wow the shorts are in. *gasp*  thankie for hte b-day hugs! i still can't believ ei'm 15. going out with a 15 year old is so much better than a 14 yr old, maybe now my dreams of pfilia will come true. hahahha. i'm jk! but anyway, i just know this year is gonna be great. we'll be doing so much stuff it wont even matter if my indefinite search for mr. perfect doesn't yield any results.........................  why is my taste so weird? lol.......but i suppose it's best put as yue does it. "older, nurting man". you got THAT right. but does nobody want to be a nurturer?   it's alright.....i'm buzzed on cofee finally, but i will have to figure out a way to get to the zoo early and get myself coffee on theatrical days.   SEE THE BIRD SHOW!!!!! pogo is the cutest but it's not hte same when cassie does it.

      so yesterday i'm at the zoo in the discovery center w/ the children, and in the puppet show area there is a group of 3-5 year old kids singing/rapping "In Da Club" by 50 Cent. it was the cutest thing ever!!! ^_^ their little high *innocent* voices singing: Go, go, go, go Go, go, go shortie It's your birthday We gon' party like it's your birthday  and you could see them moving to the beat of the song. it was soooo adorable!!!  anyways, the point of this post to to say happy birthday to one of my best friends and one of the greatest ppl i have known (also co-creator of this blog). do you even have to ask who? for those of you who must, the birthday girl is jane! now shoo! go get her a present! haha. i hope you have a great 15th year and stay alive on coffee long enough *wink wink* to find that someone you've been searching for ever since i've known you. may the next year bring you much more happiness and perhaps an assurance of your place in life. best wishes and much love from your friend.  "A friend is one who knows us and loves us anyway."

      i'm so paranoid: i'm walking through the med. center trying to find my mom's office building when i almost got run over by this lady in a green van. for a moment i panic cuz i thought that the lady was rags' mom (they look so similar!), but then i realize that she should be on a plane flying to lake tahoe and also that her car is a white acura, and i stop spazzing. nice huh?  anyways, i took that how azn are you quiz from hari's profile and it says i'm 51%. hahaha  the zoo was pretty hot today, and whenever i walked outside i felt like i was wilting or something. the heat/humidity combo sucks the life out of you better than 40 screaming/jumping/crying children does! and that is saying something. in the morning, i met up w/ zuhair and yusra as they were entering through the back gate. i went to the BEC and signed in at deb's office. i walked over to the discovery center, but got lost along the way cuz i only know like one route to get there and if i didn't see anything familiar i just kept walking in circles (i didn't mean to!). hehe so i finally get there and barbara is screaming in her radio "where is yue?!" and i guess i'm late (it was only 8:05!). so we go over this new play thing we're doing for the day (mr. sun and mr. sea) and attach string to the signs that we're gonna make the children wear when they act out the story.  blah blah blah... lunch! we get to see zuhair and yusra in their elephant and lion suits and watch them duke it out in the hall. i still wonder how they can possibly breathe/see in that thing. zuhair says deb wants to talk to me, and it turns out that she heard from someone *cough the paki guy cough* that i was miserable and that i can come work in clerical if i wanted to. i tell her i'm gonna stay in theatrical for a while and see how it goes and also that zuhair is likely to say such things (lies! ^_-). i am going to ask to work wed. and thurs. in clerical just to see how i like it though.  jane is spazzing about how stephen is no longer on the bird show website. she thinks he went to another zoo. the rest of us want to convince her that he is dead and make her give up on something that was impossible in the first place. she needs someone nurturing; please (oh gawd please!) contact me or anyone who knows the hemann twins if you know someone who is interested in taking on the role of jane's loving/nurturing/doting older man.  *how serendipitous is this?: i'm reading his email that i couldn't earlier at the zoo cuz it was so long, and as i'm reading he calls on the cell! ^_^

      *add-on to yesterday's post  Mr. Willen was at graduation! (*shudders* WHY HIM???) the kuo twins had greecian shoes! ahhh!  anyways, sorry for not calling you. my mom came into my room and took both phones away so i was left w/ only the monkey to comfort me. which it did, kinda: so i go to sleep holding the monkey and i'm in this dream, then i start laughing/giggling our loud (in reality) b/c in the dream rags is tickling me. then i wake up. fun fun  *today's events  i went to the zoo at like 7:40ish and am the first one there, besides deb and lauren (who of course would be there early). deb is aggravated b/c she forgot her key ring. so we wait for other ppl to show up, and they don't, and at 8 we leave on the golf/zoo cart to go to the BEC. i leave my lunch in there, check in on the shocking yellow sheet, and go to the discovery center on the cart. no one is there either. by communication by radio, deb finds barbara and goes on the cart to get her (apparently at the front gate w/ ppl) and a quiet zoo day starts (we only had like 3 ppl for the first story theatre cuz the children's zoo was like empty at that point). it wouldn't be quiet for long though, cuz the ppl started flooding in after lunch (which was spent in the blue smurf's office in the BEC and looking at pic online *i love their internet! go T1 lines!!!*) so in conclusion it was a good first day and very tiring, even though not much happened.  after the zoo crew thing was over (@4), i ask jane's dad to drive me to Gate 1 to look for mom, who isn't there, then we go to my house, remember that i don't have the keys, and go to jane's apt complex to check up on eleanor (i swear, she just woke up and was even in her PJ's! haha). i dip in the pool, and eventually they decide to jump in. we walk around after that looking like soaked turkeys/chickens (it's a chinese phrase, do ask if ur wondering) and scare the ppl in the lounge and office by asking for towels and cookies. we then talk about stuff on this elevated patio dealy that previously had a grill on it. rags answers some questions pretty insufficiently during this whole ordeal. so my mom calls, tells me my dad is coming over, and yells at my over the phone. how typical. i go home and end up really happy cuz i finally got to talk to someone. *wink wink*

      went to graduation today. it was just bleh. (the ride over was equally bleh, cuz my dad kept telling me my directions were wrong when he had no idea how to get there himself.)  jason looked dismal as well. i swear, he hasn't washed his hair in days and he didn't wear a shirt under his gown (or he wore a t-shirt -_-) we (me and jane) didn't get to see him after the ceremony (damnation, the only reason i went was for the pic! x_X) so jane couldn't give him the card and she didn't find the snoopy doll either (what kind of hallmark store doesn't have grad. gifts on the day of graduation? gawd.)  paul was the only nice senior. he actually noticed jane and looked in my direction for a pic. yay! but his eyes are unfixably red (like devillish and not correctable by adobe. bish) so are the french nice or not?  amol's speech was so blah/bleak (yea running out of syns for dismal). i mean, i thought that he would have something less bland to talk about than having patience cuz bellaire has so many problems. geez. where is the passion?  i saw ms. loonam w/ a plant after the ceremony. jane saw a taller JB (that totally ruins the concept) before the bellaire ppl arrived today (the lamar one was right before it)  my camera is screwed up. the pics all turned out really dark and the ppl were all undiscernible even though the lighting wasn't that bad. but luckily, adobe can fix it pretty easily. only one is posted up on the pics site though.   i start at the zoo tomorrow! i finally get to act crazy w/ children! ah yes that is the schizz.  PS. my mom started asking me about the monkey today (why is it so beat-up/ugly? where did you get it?). she insists that i lied, which i kinda did (i told her i found it at school somewhere) and won't let me do anything until i tell her the truth. personally i think it really is none of her business where i got it. after all, it is my property, not her's, right?

      gosh, maybe i really was drunk. cuz i just took a shower, and my mind has cleared and i've thought of about ten million more things i meant to say. cept i thin i've forgotten them all again.  i know one of them was about mary. she's so pretty and nice. i think now i know what justin means by all the dallas area girls are great.  and another one was about my budget. ok, this graduation snoopie is gonna be the last non necessary item i spend any money on. seriously dude. if i just stopped messing around and was just cheap for a month or two, i could pay back yue all the money i ower her. and then maybe i just might get around to buying that southern belle hat, or what y'all call the hick hat. i likes it. dont diss it. but it's cheaper over the phone....stupid claires. i want that native american necklace too.  oh right, serendipity is everywhere. yue is like a fortune teller. i swear, today we were talking about eric rudolph and that abortion clinic dealy and how i was a block away and all from it, and then tonight my dad just told me HE FINALLY GOT CAUGHT!!!!!!!!!!! wow.  urlLink    have fun. anyway yah..........that was just freaky.  everyone come to graduation. tomorrow at 5, hofheinz pavillion (ooh ahh the french, non stanford-9 way) at UH. come watch the evil force of darkness, aka ugluk, saruman's chief ork, aka amol, speak instead of a greater (?) evil. lol.  c ya

GOAL: kill in 10 hours (in addition to what we already did)  Hours:   Tasks: 1 *cluster people for permanent jobs, make more people and kill food and build city in groups 2 begin to clear cliff (sight  3 finish cliff, finish wall and buildings 4 build warships and expand sea territory, kill Toman heavy transports, advance if possible, make our own 5 expand fishing territory by killing Romans 6 try to advance to Iron Age, make more poeple/soldiers to assign jobs in clusters (as many as possible) 7 build maze with wall (preferably upgraded) 8 research everything, upgrade everything, build/make everything ( WATCH THE FOOD! ) 9 with the buildings we have built, do everything they allow, paying attention to food (including making more priests to heal injured people) 10 plan all out attack on Rome and Syracuse with heavy transports, warships, siege weapons, soldiers, etc.  repeat hours 1-9 constantly if possible with food allowances (outwit Romans and Syracues with what they have - kill themselves)    man... we stuck to the schedule for like two hours... but by then we had success w/ the rest of the stuff and won the game! i think we were both kinda psycho then... cuz this was like a planned daily thing... jane would jog over to my apt. everyday and play it (the game was on my comp) and oh... the memories  ooo! jane found our stalking "map of the neighborhood"!!! ^_^

      crazy chinese parents... they kept asking to see my teeth at dinner today ("just open your mouth and keep it open for 30 seconds!")... as if i didn't have teeth all along. and my dad (or so he's deluded himself into thinking) gave my mom the idea to sneak into my room while i'm sleeping (nobody... understand? NOBODY disturbs me during that precious time) and pry open my mouth to marvel at my teeth... *shudders thinking of what their parents did to them when they were my age...*

      i almost thought it wasn't happening today... my orthodontist was all like "i'll take them off when i feel like taking them off" and then the lady that commented on my gums commented on my skin... eck "girl, you skin is so smooth!" w/ a hick/homegirl accent dealie... and she's caucasian! this is so wrong... *shakes head*  but they did take the braces off... and did the impressions for my retainers (that stuff feels like gum... but w/ no taste) get this: they have retainers that glow in the dark!? how outrageous is that? i mean... who would actually be able to see their retainers in the dark? unless they were some psychopath who just stared at the mirror in bed w/ their mouth gaping, or someone who took them off just to see how they glow (and that would be me)...  so the lady was all like "are you ready to go back to school" *i nod* and she's all like "what's wrong w/ you, girl??? are you bored or something?" *nods again as there are pliers in me mouth cutting the wires* while that was happening... the dr. was talking to my dad about how he's a 4th generation chinese who can still speak cantonese bc he used to live in some segregated neighborhood where the land deed was like "restricted to non-whites" and such.  next week i'm gonna prolly miss the morning of card. camp cuz i got an appt. again... bleh why do they need more x-rays???? all that radiation cannot be good for me... ack  i got home and brushed my teeth (yea... weirdo... i know...) to see how it felt like. heh... how come i don't remember this from before? it's like i have NO teeth! and the flossing was weird too... man... i dun think i can get used to this. and i think that my teeth have enlarged or something, as they just stand out so much whenever i open my mouth... they didn't do that before, did they?  oOOo! it looks like it's gonna rain! w00t!!!!  and new ncx topic for me and my partner: coast guard  where are you jane?

      yes... so what if my posts are short and sequential? i like it that way! and there's nothing you can do to make me change it! hmph!  i'm so proud of myself... my w.hist work now takes up 14 pgs on word! YAY!!! and so close to the  suhweeeeeet  end!!!! man i labored so tediously today to make that chart on opium... prolly uselessly... but still... i gotta make everything look nice, clean and cut!  we were discussing our deep, dark secrets, right? and then... zuhair refuses to tell me his! but he told jane! i swear... i'm soooo getting it out of you it's not even funny! no one keeps anything from me once i know they're keeping something. after all, i am the DIGGER!!! (and i'm not called that for no reason...)  and we also discovered that i don't have anything terrible to hide. i mean... i went through a pretty horrific phase what w/ the depression and suicide and such... but everyone knew about that (jane made sure they did... heh). wow... i can't believe i haven't even committed thoughtcrime!  that's it for now. loaded schedule tomorrow! but now... off to the sweetness that makes me beam! ^_^

      ok, ok i MUST make up for those absolutely horrible and pointless previous 2 posts. man,....what was i thinking???? hahaha....observating is no good if ur jsut observating for the sake of observating. i must cleanse myself of the defilation i have done to the art of prose, to the science of journalism.  ok...cool anecdotes and musings up the schizza are coming ur way!!!!!  first things frist. i got an email from zuhair, and hahaa he thought that email from lauren was funny too. that one where lauren is ranting at me about ....oh what the hell.i 'll just post it. ----------------- jane i'm writing you about the content from the last newsletter. i am very upset that you edited my article ("in the beginning") and put zuhair, amy, and nika's names on it. that was my article that wasn't finished in time that i could have fixed up for the next newsletter. i was the one who called around and got the information and actually wrote the base of the article. the least you could have done was told me that you were changing it and putting other people's names on it. i hope that in the future you can stop tampering with articles that are not yours, at least mine anyway. also, i'm tired of your name being in there more times than anyone else's combined. maybe you could add all of our names in there just because we helped with it too. (i.e.-lauren and i, whose names weren't mentioned once). maybe all of us could be the final editors in the newsletter, so that everything is fair.  lauren shapiro  ---------------------- funny stuff. i know, i know, the charges are serious, the allegations not completely untrue, but HAHAHA. man if u had seen what sort of stuff was going thru my mind when i read that......like some of the most arrogant, bigheaded, meanest stuff i've ever thought. but i'll let u guys speculate (prolly correctly) on what i was thinking. all i know is that, barbara is an idiot, thoughtcrime is real but i hope for that little second it wasn't. lol. man i woulda been like....definitely NOT inhereiting the earth, by anyone's standards. but hey!!! i was sticking up for the cards....lol  let's see...i just finished chapter one!!!!!! SWEETNESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and listening/dancing around to victory music. sorry, no neshika today (is that sighs of relief i hear?)  but i think it just got a little old. plus w/o a lyrics i'm getting frustrated that i can't sing along to it. apparently, that's the only cover that rinat bar has ever done. therefore, no big publicity on the net, therefore no lyrics for jane here.  i dug out dean's verve pipe cd and i forgot how good it was....man this was the spirit of debate. debate with matt anyway....wow those were some interesting times. man,h e's such a cool dude for not blowing up in my face when i missed octos (and state points! and a potential qual with eleanor, my lover) beafcuse of a stupid orthodntist appointment. ooh  speaking of which.......  MAZEL TOV!!! u know who u are, u know why i'm congratulating you. oh and to all the jews out there....sorry if i spelled that wrong. i spelled it wrong at michelle's bat mitzvah even, so i've accepted my sucking like a mother.  hmm........i still can't get over it, but man mitchell and hari suck even more than i do. geez, i'm not totally blameless in either scenario but they are SUCH LOSERS!!!! it's all good now, but to think i almost lost raghu again, and that yue blocked me!!! she hasn't done that since our year long break in 8th grade!!!! WHAT THE CRAP!!!!!!  haha, so mitchell thinks josh was yelling at me when it was actually my dad who wasn't even yelling (that loud lol)...........and who thinks i STARTED the whole damn thing. geez.......get a life mr rao. well, just to show u, i'm going to the zoo tomorrow to spite you and smile sweetly and let u know that life is peachy keen despite all your goddamn interferences.  and i was wrong about the lanier manwhores. the list still stands: josh, zuahir, naeem, and chang   ok, now that i got THAT off my chest......................  yue, i'm too lazy to send u my world hstory work to prove i did it. but just to show u that i'm good for the work, here's the last sentence of section 1.14, haha u know me too well to think that i would skip around.  "...And even though a preconception of European backwardness limited Chinese curiosity, the Chinese did approach what they did know without the narrow-minded European habit of putting information into manmade categories."  there? see, now life is perfect. absolutely perfect......we,lll, except for hte fact that i ahvent been practicing clarinet in ages, but i've got that covered.  on friday, i shall go to bellaire and take care of some crap with salem about TB, and then i'll go recycle all that crap that's been piling up, and then i'll go shopping cuz my dad is one of those cheap asians who wants to go during tax free weekend. lol. OMG dont get me started on how shopping with my mom is. ok, i wont. lol. :-D and theno n saturday i will try and hope that i am ungrounded (oh yah, i'm grounded again. me and eleanor went to matt's house for pizza and a debate round and i came home late after hearing my dad specifically tell me not to go anywhere that night [naeem's idea....kill him!] oh yah.....congrats on ur idea to convert to the bright side!!!! LD CAN GO SUCK MOTHER!!! lol well stubbs anyway) and then me and eleanor will go turn in our lovely finished coral reefs file, and then start on our wonderful bidirectional subsea dumping aff, and then you, me , eleanor, and josh (make raghu come too) will go tot he zoocrew banquet. tostados dinner...YES....now that josh's wisdom teeth pain is gone, he can eat those hard, hard chips.  man, now i'm hungry......................................  and haha, i'll practice clarinet all day sunday after MY braces stop hurting. oh right, updates: i'm getting hte tops off next time (meaning early september) and the bottoms will come on in a couple of months. haha my orthodontist is so funny, i usually am pretty pissed off at him but me and him have this special bond where it's like "ur dad is crazy. i know. wink wink". oh but get this: his cousin, jonathon hicks, writes for the new york times. SWEETNESSS. summer internship, here i come baybe.   and if that doens't work out, ms floreani says there is one at the chronicle. oh well...i've learned to settle in my life.  i'm hungry.  i think i'll go eat now............  signing off.   bush is such an idiot. go sign that petition, y'all  jane

      ok, i suppose i'll finish this up. i realy dont want to though...AHHHH. ok...where was i . oh right...wednesday.  more dismalness in class...but by this time we all thought that it was too late anyway, and we might as well get some rest in class. haha ie, sleeping and listening to music.  we got some work back.....i never got my headlines back. booohooo. lol. let's see, what else did i get back. oh right, my captions. hahaha man the girl in front of me (sarah, she reminds me of elizabeth gardener, both in personality and looks, but she's nice and i liked her) saw my paper ands he was like "man, that is al ot of red haha". she was right. lol...but i was sort of pissed off because she said that like everything i wrote was an opinion. ok, how is this an opinion? "bellaire students work really hard." begeezus...........lol. oh, and then she told us about editorials: "dont write them unless ur sure u can change the situation." wow. journalism, defeated. and we didn't even WRITE them. the only real writing we did was feature writing, but nobody got done cuz we had like only an hour and no sources. geez....  oh, but that night was the journalism olympics. ok, ok, i know that sounds hilarious. hahhaa, ok it DID. when eleanor heard that she was going crazy. heeheeeheee. i thought it was like "sit down and write a headline" sort of thing, but it was actually like....a physical thing. there were different relay type activites.....or team activities anyway and it was soooo wesome. besides the constant threat of west nile and really annoying teams from hick schools, we did all right. but the yearbook ppl suck mother beacuse they made their own team and abandoned us. in fact, most of them didn't even play. grr...so us tppers made our own team and were really aesome...but haha we were in third to alst place. not enougg to win, not bad enough to get the booby prize, which was AWESOME. (silly string) but kumar and david heaton stole some anyway s o we had fun. dumped ice on the head judge guy, and sprayed him with silly string when that didn't work. ooh...but here's how pathetic "journalism" camp was.  everywhere we went, we were reminded of the yearbookjs. besides the camp being put on by Taylor, we did YEARBOOK spreads in beginning newspaper. haha, and then for the spirit prize at the olympics, we were told to yell out yearbook as loud as we could.....man and it was funny, everyone was yelling yearbook and we're all screaming and jumping at the top of our lungs...."NEWSPAPER!!!!!!!!!!!" haha everyone got it akick out of it but those losers still didn't give us the prize....grrr.  oh well, it turned out all rignt. ooh...but then that night we watched "the ring". me and liang that is....on my computer. man dude that si a FREAKY movie. that's why i dont like scary movies...but i can't deny that it was good. nice, suspenseful, but it just had a few plot issues and was hard to follow if u weren't paying too much attention. there was a lot of foreshadowing though so it was really really cool to be light "[lightbuld pops] and THAT's why..." lol but me and liang were scared as crap when we saw it. her roommate fell asleep and dint want to see/hear about the rest, and mine had seen it efore and went o bed in the middle cuz she was like "i cant see that again". but me and liang saw it and OH MY GOd. the scariness....haha after it was done we were talking for awhile...and then she started commenting on the ligt that was coming from under the door and shiningo n the wall and i stuck my handundre the bed tio make a shadow and i dunno why but i got scared up my ass and scaremed....ands he did too...haha. ohh but the funniest thing was when she got out her flashlight cuz we were sorta creeped out by the dark, and she flashed it right in my face and u know the whole "ringy" nature of hte light creeped me out the crap and it scared me soooo much.  ooh but the next day on the way home, we watched it again and naeem said the ring video looked just like a tool video. *shakes head* anyway....  so not much is up. me and eleanor went to UH yesterday. we gt alot of stuff done......haha i counted my cards today and ther were exactly 100 cards. haha no tags yet, but HEY! eleanor hasn't counted her cards yet either so there...........wow this is going to be AWESOME.  oh, no we still ahve to make an aff. dammit.  oh, but while we were at the library, eleanor was trying to avoid hari, bc she was "out of town" so i was keeping her company and trying to keep her cover, but i think everyone ntoiced cuz we tried to run out of there and everyone saw "someone",and i told them it was my friend beverly crank. haha...niec drug reference huh?  but anyway now he's i dunno, prolly pissed off at me and telling raghu all this shit and crap.....very vaguely too i might add so it's just so stupid cuz now the whole rebuilt trust thing is like tumbling down and UGH UGH UGH. stupid hari. i can't say i've been the most civil person but geez this just sucks monkey. not only does he now believe i STARTED the mitchell thing just because mitchell was an idiot, and thought that josh was yelling at me when it was my DAD. geez what a pathetic loser. now i am going to go back to the zooj ust to freaking SPITE him. lol. but now raghu thinks i said all that crap about him, and about yue, and geez......ok fine let hari be mad but do NOT screw with my friends............aiya and now raghu assumes i started the whole "situation". dammit dammit dammit.  i have to do more world history.  jane  sleeping till 4 aint bad.

      WOW YOU BLOGGED!!!!!!!! :-O  well...i think the summer is only going to get more and more dismal. or wait. correction: i think i have ceased to be amused by everything. jeez this summer is sucking big time....  well, i'll get around doing that observating i keep promising/should do anyway.  Tales from camp......  Monday:  my dad woke me up at 6.30 AM and i'm all like "SHIT!" because i had this preconceived notion that TPP/YB were punctual ppl and that i would be late. no worries though, i got to jane vora's house at 6.00 exactly and i was still like the third person there. we then waited like an hour because this one person forgot his permission slip and they had a hell of a time securing it before we could leave. me, varun, naeem, hari, liang, and julie rode in ms. floreani's van because she came on the bus and asked for someone to come and keep her company. so, we all went on the spur of the moment. i, being an idiot, brought prolly a little too much carry on luggage. i had my purse (filled with snacks) and this other bag, which held my computer, a bottle of water, various debate articles to read on the way, world history materials, and of course, cd's. we didn't really do anything on the way over except listen to music and talk about it. i'm so glad hari's converted to the rock world.........i was prolly a little too excited on the way over there. really, no caffeine pills, no coffee either and i was sooo excited and hyper and bouncy and stuff.  on the way, i realized how far we were from home. and i kept calling people toto. oh right, on the way we realized that we left kyle and my pillow on the bus. *dammit* oh well. so we saw fireworks stands, confederate flags, prisons galore, cows and horsies, and messed up trees on the way over there. and when we got there, i thought something might be up. "sam houston state university" is sort of an embellishment of the campus. wait,...ok "university" might be an embellishment. it really does look better once u get to a certain end of campus but WOW the dorms were...well not dilapidated, but they were getting there. plus, the maps and signs are horrible so we had to go up those nonhoustonish hills like 3 times with all of our luggage. yes, accidents almost happened. so we finally got to our dorms, and they were pretty pathetic. small.....and maybe not cramped per se, but definitely very confining. the walls were white, and we were forbidden from opening the windows sot here wasn't much light, especially since we were underground on one side and only the second story iin the lee ont he other. there was one bathroom which doubled as a hallway to the other dorm. i shared a room with asya rosenberg (from jazz band) and liang and yin (photog) were on the other side. geez it was scary...........but before we even had lunch, apparently a bunch of rules were broken. rule #10, which got a big deal made out of it on this trip, said that no co-ed visitng was allowed. EVER. we weren't even allowed on each others floors. hahah......the girls floor was 1, the guy's was like 4. i wonder why they thought all the separation was necessary. HAHA. well anyway, we kept visitng before the rules were explained to us and it was cool. nothing happened, it was a nice sense of community and we played cards while i played music that i loved and fought the others to play. in other words, "neshika". hahaha. but apparently, a lot of ppl do LIKE it. haha, well ok, the jewish kids had heard it from BBYO before (david heaton and asya) so they were totally cool with it. SEEE LIANG........  had lunch at quizno's. wanted to kill myself in class in the afternoon and night because it was so boring and pointless.  i considered quitting, but i figured it ahd to get better once the basics were over. that night....stayed up until 2.45 working on world history. haha, dont kid me, i didn't start until like 12.30 anyway because me and liang were.....well actually, i can't quite figure out what we were actually doing.   tuesday:  woke up at 5.30 because kumar and liang wanted to go jogging. haha i said i'd go along, but after liang spent like 15 minutes waking me up, i got up and walked to the coffee shop (kaldi's...vERY GOOD PLACE. a lot better than starbucks.....). i got hot chocolate... naeem and liang's discovery of the caffeine pills the night before sort of made me feel guilty as crap. i tried to read the houston chronicle, but after getting really bored and not noting anything except the discovery of patrick denhey's killer and orlando sanchez's campagin fundrasiing, i left since it was 7, and i had to be back for breakfast. intersting breakfast....i am not ever going to complain about the food there. sure, it's a little bland, and a little oily but oh well. i dont have to make it, i dont have to clean dishes, so i wont complain. we had several presentations ........the one last night was about the "personality of your publication" and it was really awesome. David Knight, this dude from south carolina came a really intesrting speech. he talks / acts like ahick, but is not afraid to admit it so it's cool as crap. the one we had that morning was with gary tuchmann, who is appaerntly a national correspondenct from CNN. it was really cool, he was acting all cool and debaterish before he started, and whne he got up there he was being al spontaenous and awesome and i SOO hope i can be like him someday. he also gave a really cool presentation. very journalistic like. he gave a few gerneralizations, and then he kept giving anecdotres about things he does. cool stuff...there were stories about iraq, afghanistan, 9/11......there were a couple of cool quotes he gave.  one was about how being a journalist is being aewsome, and he said that "journalism isn't hte most lucrative job you can get, especially at first. but people who this do it because they love it, because they get to see so much more than everyone else. it's not like with other jobs; their heads dont go stale."  and another one was about the responsibilitys "at 9/11, i easily could have lost it. they did a horrible thing, one that i will never forgive or forget. when something is evil, it's a fact. but i didn't lose it on there, it was my duty as a journalist to help the nation grieve by giving them the facts, and by remaining composed. it's that sense of duty that keeps you going, and keeps you going objectively."  not much else that dad. kyle decided to be smasrt and switched from beginning newspaper to advanced writing. i stuck it out a little longer. plus shit with hari started today.  there was a dance tonight. hahahaha. there was actually pretty good music, i'm going to say that even though it was all rap/dance, but we went and got the free teeshirts. man....at this point i started living in my pajamas. ooh...funny thing. befre we went to the dance and after dinner and class, me and liang went to the guy's rooms bc even though our floor monitor said it was against the rules, theirs was ok with it. but apparently, their floor monitor is the boyfriend of ours, and he called her to tell her that we wre up there and was just going to tell us to keep it down (cuz i was playing gymnopedie reaaaaaallly loud while i was working on world hsitory), but she came there and got really pissed off. she just told me and liang to leave, but she started yelling at the guys, and yelled at them again the next time she saw them when we wre all leaving for hte dance. so that was it. when we got back from the dance, we all got bored, and then us and a bunch of ppl sat in the TV room and played sppoons. i think it was me, liang, hari, varun, naeem, claire, catherine, robert, and some stratford people....but we kept getting loud there so we relocated to the lobby of our dorm, where we ended up playing mafia, this game that jane vora and some yearbook ppl showed us when they came.   i didn't do that..me and hari and naeem sat out there and played because i thought the game was a little frivolous.  and then....me and liang sat in the hallway and talked in chinese about various thinsg. oh it was funny, naeem came and heard us talking, and he's all "jane, i dont know chinese, but i think ur chinese sucks." -_- yah, so then me and liang left and i started working on world hstory again. well, we talked a bunch and stuff and i only did 2 sections that night. i still ent to sleep at 2.30 though, cuz i just oculdn't get into the work and i forced myself to finish those two sections.  my dad is being annoying now....he's sitting ont he couch watching tv and wants me to get off. well, he's hinting at it but i think i'll just finisht his later........  ciao y'all. i'll finish my stories and talk some more later....  dammit why does josh ahve to be out of town!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   mazel tov to eleanor. ;-)  jane

      i am sooo disappointed in myself... i guess the world history thing isn't gonna work out (update: wait NVM!!! only 31 pgs in this chp... easy as pie)... blish... it's more like skip one day... do 10 secs the next now... arg... talk about keeping to my schedule...  so... the cause for all of that would be... shopping of all things (which also meant i missed going swimming... BAH!!!)! which actually wasn't so bad cuz my mom's friend came w/ and she's not bad for conversation. man... i think i annoyed that fitting room lady at old navy... cuz i tried so many things and only bought one (sleeping tank... my mom's making me throw out my "old nasty shirts"... sniff sniff *memories*)! haha... man, i was so tempted to buy these pants... but they were for guys, so my mom was like "er.... yue? i dun think this is your section" ahh... but they were so spacious and comfy!!! why can't they make them for girls? i mean... not everything has to be skin tight and "shapely"... sometimes you just wanna kick back and lounge... begeezus... even the cargo pants (which are supposed to be somewhat loose) are like "ultra low waist" and such... gawd...  so we went shopping for jeans (never a good experience) at jcpenney and i bought 2 black shirts... my mom must think i'm crazy cuz i was also looking at a black sweater... hehe she's all like "why does everything have to be black? it sucks the color from your skin... try red or something!" yup yup so i had to acquiesce to buying the red (actually more maroon than red) one... which i must say... doesn't look that terrible... hehe [on the flip side of things: now that i have a sweater of my own... which my mom will make sure i wear... maybe i don't need the jacket anymore?  JK !!! who do i think i'm fooling? i'm too attached to let it go (such a needy "baby".... haha) and i'm expecting it at card camp ~_^]  so my mom gets lazy bummish and doesn't want to cook dinner, and makes us go to her friend's to eat. mmm mmm good food. i offered to run home after, but my mom was like "you don't want to be all skin and bones, do you?" (i'm not even close to that!) and it was already 9 and dark outside... so we drove home (while she complained about the bass in the car... haha)  but guess what? now i have to go running tomorrow (i'm forcing my dear mother to come as well... "come on! it's good for your health!" hehe) AND finish 10 sections of world history... think i could do that?  no chance...    which means that i'll prolly be attacked by mosquitoes w/o me mum to divert their attention... ;) and that pershing will be getting a visit from an alumna again... ^_^ look out, art cow!

      hahaha no matter how aggravating chinese parents may be... you've got to admit, their ignorance is pretty amusing sometimes: -my dad started calling ppl who weren't "in the know" country mice today -while discussing cell #'s... we came upon 0174... which is pronounced ling yao qi si in chinese... and they messed around w/ it until it said ni yao qi si... which means you will die of anger or something... HIlarious -my parents had fun figuring out what exactly those "tapioca pearls" were at star snow ice  oOo! new cell #: 713-858-1076 (notice the two 8's and the lack of 4's... gawd are those chinese superstitious!)  *beaming*

      aww....that's a nice quote. that one about living to be a hundred that is. *sniff* but strangely enough, i've thought about that before. see, which way do you decide to go? if u live longer, u will have to live w/o the one you love. if you die first, he will he sad living w/o YOU. and it's just unrealistic trying to die at the same side. otherwise....*cough* double-suicide, and that is just too cult-like to me. speaking of cults, the Mormon student center at SHSU has a cult discussion meeting wednesday nights. haha...see no "on" for me. that's "journalistically incorrect."   speaking of which, it sucked monkey balls. i'll tell you guys what happens later, David Knight, a journalism guru, says to practice "observating" everyday, and then to share your work. so i suppose that's what i ought to be doing from now on. i'll post my observations later. prolly tomorrow cuz i'm too lazy to do it tonight, just glad to be home from those stupid ass dorms. camp sucked like a mother but it turned out alright, but for a pretty silly reason. same old same old, school spirit. if those journalism olympics (eleanor doubled over when she heard that phrase, i'll let u guys stipulate what that is until i post up what happened later) hadn't saved us and united the TPP staff, then i wouulda just been depressed as hell.  ugh. mitchell is a manwhore. enough said.   man now i'm really not going in to work tomorrow.  man the zoo sounds fun now. deb's invitation is sort of screwy...........saturday, august 8th? wtf...lol she is prolly just out of it like i am. WOOHOO!!!! been sleeping 3-6 (AM) for 3 nights in a row. and we saw the ring last night. disturbing stuff.  love you guys  i'm going for a walk  jane  ps HOUSTON ROCKS@!!!!! u have no idea how scarily hick-ish it is on the way and up there. 2 confederate flags against pure white backgrounds, a huge fireworks stand, dense forests of trees that look like they have OD'd on auxin, and people working at wendy's with too much makeup on. oh, right, and a van parked outside my dorm marked "Flatonia I.S.D." in French script. back in civilization. thank you.........

      i am... how do you say it... pissed? ok... not really. i know there is a good reason why some ppl have not called at all today... or maybe they did call but i was out injuring myself or something. hehe  anyhow... i went "jogging" to pershing today (only bc my dad was vacuuming my room and he takes forever! arg)... i dunno if you can really call it jogging cuz i ran to pershing... strained my right calf... walked part of the way home... tried to run again but i think that i only did it more harm... >.  let's see... pershing isn't that much different, but get this: they have something called panda camp! hahaha how HI-larious is that? and it's on the same days as cardinal camp too... coincidence? man... pershing is have "overfilling" issues: 6th graders are being asked to enroll in pin oak. ooo i saw our art cow! hehe it took the place of that fugly panda... but the panda is still off to the side (where the nice teacher restrooms are... remember the NJHS induction? haha and our failed "trio" attempt?)  man... i didn't know i could sweat that much... that shirt was so nasty when i got home... i mean... you would have thought i went running in the rain or something... hehe.  i saw the cutest dogs today! i was crossing this bridge by my house on the way back and this guy had two of them on leashes. one of them (a small terrier) kinda sniffed at my ankle (it tickled! hehe). apparently "they aren't dangerous. they just like people." but man... i was so scared when i was walking up the front lawn. see... one of the ppl that live across the street has this gray scottie and it barks like mad sometimes. i have no idea why it wasn't leashed or in its fence thing... i was just walking and it started barking tentatively at me... then it started to come towards me and bark louder... i was afraid it was going to chase after me and bite me... so i remained calm... did NOT run... and rang the doorbell franticly and arrived in the air conditioned safety of my home... hehe

      i don't feel like writing, so here is a list of my complaints... maybe i'll add on to it later: 1) AIM is not dangerous... it isn't a random chatroom where you talk to ppl you've never even met... i can't be abducted and have my organs sold by someone i talk to on AIM! gawd... i know these ppl!!! and they aren't criminals... 2) what is the point of being away for hours on aim?!?!?! i mean... it clogs up my buddy list... and for what? all you ppl just want to feel special when you get back and someone has left you a message... 3) summer heat is the killer of motivation... it just consumes all your energy and makes you lethargic... and what's this i hear about summer "break"? a break from what? i mean... we still get work during the "break"... 4) guys have got it made. their lives are so much simpler than ours... for one, they don't have to deal w/ the "cycle" every month...  >.<

      only now do i understand josh's (and many other cynial ppl's) problem with microsoft. see, for me, it's not so much the whole monopolizing thing......but it's just that....geez, when they want you to use something, u've got no choice. and i'm still not talking about windows-compatible software or that lawsuit netscape had a few years back....  WHY THE CRAP WONT WINDOWS MEDIA JUST BACK OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what the crap......i just want to use cd player as....the CD PLAYER!!!!! it takes like 2 seconds for that to come on...and stupid windows media takes like 15 and uses up all the RAM so all other functions slow down.....not only that, the window it plays in is sooo stupid, there's not enough options and too much stupid "pretty visualizations". and it wont even let me turn it off as the default cd player!!!! AHHHHHH DAMN YOU MICROSOFT!!!!!!!!!!!!  ************************** ok, enough of that. this is what 2 days in the house does to jane.  so yesterday was alright. i had expected to go to the zoo (even though my dad said i wasn't, but my mom stuck up for me when it came to the zoo so i thought it was alright) but it turns out SOMEONe didn't wake me up (the person who does all the waking in my family is my dad) so i slept until like......noon. then i had nothing to do. correction: i had bushels and bushels to do, but i didn't feel like it. so then  i went to meena's house to get my stuff (atlas shrugged, whist world, cd, etc) and i ended up staying and we talked about the things meena and jane talk about. planning things out....fretting abut next year...and loving it. *ahhh* bliss for the overachiever. HEY! u can't talk ...... that's how we met hahahaha. yes, and i mean both of us. yue, remember 7th grade and that algebra fiasco with the counselors? aiya.   note to self: why is it, that walking TO somewhere always seems to take longer than walking back?  so anyway, i got back, and i was tired, and i watched TV, ate, and went online. oh....i burned CD #3. i think it's a nice mix.....but i was analyzing my music trends (boredom? no, it's just jane) from the stuff i've downloaded and burned ever since i got kazaa.....and here's how it boils down.  CD #1 ------- very commercial pnk-rock type of stuff....mixed in with some feel-good pop and some sentimental crap.....  meaning, lots of greenday, lots of Jimmy Eat World, Savage Garden and no Doubt of course.....the vines......RHCP galore.....and nirvana bc that bastard still had influence on me at the time. how sad...i will note the date. 6/7/03.  CD #2 --------- less poppy, but WAAY more commericalized alternative-might-as-well-be-punk stuf......highlights are Sum 41, Chevelle, New Found Glory, No Doubt, Blink 182 , Sugarcult, and Blue October.  CD #3 -------- it sort of went from happy-go-lucky-feel-good stuff to really bitter hard metal. *shudder* lol......  starts off with stairway to heaven...then kiss kiss....then summer nights......then complicated (avril, yah i know)......u get the gist of it....to jane says, brena, and passenger.   man i am schizo.   ********************** enough of that. so, josh isn't going to be in debate anymore. how tragic...and i mean that with no sarcasm. because we know stubbs is too much to a monkey fucker to back down. but oh well, it's for the best. i mean......it's not like he hasn't got lots of other cool meaningful things to do.  but i want to be there when stubbs gets told off.. .... hahaha. i'm going to enjoy that. but sort of in a guilty way of course.....i mean..ok so stubbs is an evil republican who sits on stools of evil from OfficeMax, or whatever the cheap HISD equivalent is to that.  but still........shaft was a bigger asshole than stubbs is and ever will be. yes josh, i know that's hard to believe, but me and my twin and lesbian lover know that to be false. and really...i mean if playing favorites isnt the most despicable thing a teacher could ever do, playing favorites to get back at other teachers surely is. that is soooo beyond wrong. i mean, even my dad got really pissed off at that and he didn't even take me to the ER when i broke out in hives.  and stubbs,.....well even though he mighta been doing it just to get back at shaft, he was still at least very consistently nice to us......i mean....think about it. i'll always be grateful for how he treated me and eleanor and meena and yue when our grades were in peril, our morales in the bottom of the grand canyon, and how he was teling us not to let him get to us bc he was a big shithead. now if THAT wasn't comforting, then i dont know what was.......i mean....he's like, a pillar of strength. well maybe not anymore...but at least he's still a pillar. and that's gotta be better than shaft the shithead running around, playing favorites that include doped- up baseball players who turn out to be pedophiles and get sent to california w/o even checking out of school. oh right...add stalkers to that too.  what a year.............i can't forget that though. gratitude will always go where it is deserved.   but of course....this is just plain low. and i know where my loyalties lie (lay? man i should have paid more attention in ms. shepards.). and man....it's killing me inside.  ******************************** enough of that. so anyways..i dunno what it is, prolly just being inside for too long, but i sort of lost it last night. i somehow came to this revelation that i had wasted my entire summer and probably much of my life, and that i've got no higher motivation in life other than to "get the grade" and now that school is out and ther's no grades tog et....well i've got nothing to do. hmm.......i mean that whole "make a difference" thing is just way to vague for someone like me......oh, oh i know! maybe i'll go around being everyone's optimist fairy and reminding them that society is inherently good, that it always gets better, and that nobody's life is ever wasted. *oh* look who's talking. hahaha.  wow, EVERYONE is telling me to read "the jungle." i promise....i'll get around to it.  oh but back to last night. so after xi signs on and starts trying to brainwash me into his new philosophy "ultimate capitalism good" and how he's explaining how atlas shurgged still sucks bc hHIS philosophy includes "obvious necessary rules" i'm all....i have to go bc i was really not in the mood for this....  so i sit up in bed all night and have "champagne supernova" on repeat (damn that is a good song!) and am making out schedules for the rest of the week....  like detailed, meticulous schedules. "9.30 AM - wake up. eat breakfast of 2 scrambled egs, toast and OJ. etc" cept i already deviated fromt hat cuz i had milk, not OJ. and i've REALLY deviated, cuz ive only read 1 coral reefs article, i've not practiced for band yet, room is still messy (yah, again, i know), and omg...so much stuff...no initiative...cept after i talked to yue while lying on the floor for awhile...and now i'm talking to rags again......i feel like being productive. WOW he is calculating my body fat...and i had to measure my waist.....wow i need to eat. 26.5"....that is insanely unhealthy. *pops eyes*  ScHIzOgiRrL (2:33:52 PM): 26.5" noMOREflab (2:34:19 PM): YOU ARE UNHEALTHY MY GOD!!! noMOREflab (2:34:27 PM): BEEGEEZUS! noMOREflab (2:34:31 PM): *shakes head* ScHIzOgiRrL (2:34:56 PM): OMG I KNOW! ScHIzOgiRrL (2:34:59 PM): i didn't realize it till now noMOREflab (2:35:05 PM): Your ponderal index shows -4.3% body fat noMOREflab (2:35:06 PM): but ScHIzOgiRrL (2:35:12 PM): ponderal? noMOREflab (2:35:14 PM): waist size and weight shows 3.6% fat noMOREflab (2:35:17 PM): which is very very bad ScHIzOgiRrL (2:35:20 PM): hahaha noMOREflab (2:35:32 PM): hold on noMOREflab (2:36:21 PM): if you remain at 5 4 noMOREflab (2:36:27 PM): you need to be at 112 to be normal noMOREflab (2:36:28 PM): cuz noMOREflab (2:36:33 PM): anything below that is un-normal noMOREflab (2:36:40 PM): cuz right now noMOREflab (2:36:45 PM): your BMI is at 16.7 noMOREflab (2:36:48 PM): and the norm is 19.2  ok, enough for now.  rags' 6 pack will return by the beginning of school.  and shari from HH says that the music will be here in 3 days. i still need to download tommy  which reminds me...............geez i have to go practice. but it's alright, maybe i can get a nice buz.........  signing off  jane

      yup... jane says i've been lazy and needed to blog so here goes:  jane is grounded cuz she stayed out too late w/ josh yesterday night (until 10:45... man... control yourselves! j/k) so now she can't call (bleh) and has to resort to aim of all things to stay in touch w/ her ppl.  rags has a situation... and can't call me either.  ^ other than those two things... my life is peachy keen ^_^  yesterday...  i woke up and was like "this is way too early for me to be getting out of bed" cuz it was so dark outside... and i respond to light and touch more so than sound while asleep. so i dragged myself out of bed and got ready for the zoo.  my dad's all like "call the zoo" but i've lost the contact sheet (actually i know where it is but i didn't feel like gettiing it) so we drive to the zoo in the rain. we asked the guard at the shack whether the children's zoo was open... and he said it was. but when i got there, i saw the the "children's zoo is closed" sign had been knocked over by the wind. i go inside the discovery center.... the lights are on everywhere but there is no one inside the office. so i call jane (she's stilll home at 8:15... of course... ^_~) and ask what's up. she tells me that zuhair and yusra will prolly come today and directs me to the BEC.  on the way... my shoes and socks and in turn my feet get soaked in the puddles. my legs are already wet... the slashing rain... arg. i go the blue smurf's office (still on the phone w/ jane) and find ross playing runescape (what a pointless game!) on the comp. j-rod comes in and talks to jane for a while. so i take off my shoes and socks and leave them out to dry.  i'm starting to worry that i'll be the only one here (cuz ross said he was going home early) when zuhair and yusra show up. i am saved! so we tell deb that we are here and we start on this envelope filling/labeling thing for lia.  man... there was this whole debacle about which radio station to listen to. i wanted 94.5 but zuhair kept changing it to 104... so it was like.... tunes in to 104, zuhair starts dancing/singing, i go "how can you stand him???" to yusra, and change the station. this would continue as i pestered j-rod about his silence. he eventually calls somebody and loses his head (he pass an empty enveloped as filled...) so it was the cool-aid after all... i thought he was always hyper...  we got to see the battle eagle fly... and the raven and the parrot (forgot their names) did audience demos... basically you volunteer for the bird to fly to your arm and fly back to the trainer. or you could hold out a dollar bill and let the bird take it from you and stuff it into the trainer's pocket... then fly back to you and return it to your open palm. it was pretty fun to watch... but gawd are those claws lethal... the scratches!!! haha j-rod got rejected by the parrot (they think that it was b/c he had rubber bands on his wrist and the birds aren't used to that)  i fell out of my chair! or rather... my chair broke under me and i fell with it. doug calls it "a lawsuit waiting to happen" 2 chairs in the same row broken... and what is w/ those plastic nut thingies?  at around 11, i get hungry so i eat my lunch. i introduce yusra and zuhair to the lotus root! hehe  so we go the smurf's office (we did the envelopes in the conference room) and start to edit the newsletter. i complain about the bad spacing and placing of the pics/logos and the whole non-integration of the diff. font styles. so i mess around w/ that... and in the end we have the finished product (much better than the original version... if i may say so myself... ;) ) but alas... the color printer runs out of ink before i can get my very own personal copy!!! grrrr....  while i'm editing the newsletter... zuhair managed to spill his platter of spaghetti on himself and the carpet... but he more or less picks up what he can and leaves the sauce on the floor. the room smells pretty filthy now... hehe  after lunch, lia moves us into her office to finish the envelopes cuz there's a meeting in the conference room. sarah and bennet come in (so they were here!) and everyone stares at my petite feet (enough already! i know they are small! *runs away wearing zuhair's flip-flops... trips on self...*) sarah acts out this number... but then zuhair's all pointing behind my head and yelling "raghu! raghu!" i'm like "huh?" i mean... i never expected him to show up in the office... or the zoo for that matter (it was closed for the day)... apparently he was let in by the guard after he told him he was looking for jane (someone else was looking for her too) i tell him that jane's not coming today cuz she went jogging and is hurting, so he leaves.  after we finish w/ the envelopes (there were mountains of them!) zuhair (with the new and improved newsletter in hand) and i walk over to HR so i can file and he can give the publication to the public relations guy. i file the background checks while the lady is mad cuz she's having issues w/ an excel spreadsheet. then i pulled out files of the police officers for some salary thing... monotonous work...  when i get back to the BEC, deb has database for me to do... and me and zuhair pick hairs again over which cd's to play (j-rod had left some for jane). we discuss how lia hates the intuition song by jewel cuz of the vibrato... and how justin sounds like michael jackson. so zuhair doesn't like evanescence, but i leave it on and he gets headphones so he can listen to his radio w/o being "disrupted from his work". i finish all the sign-in sheets on the clipboard and it's 4:17 already so i leave. lia reminds me to get my 6 free tickets after i come out from the BEC w/ my cell (rags asked to use it and i realized how i didn't have it in my bag)  we walk to the park and i show him my mad duck driving(-away) skills. hahaha  today... was perfect. that is the only word to describe it. no more needs to be said... :)

      this is why everybody has to read the joy luck club. (c yue's last post). this is why we are forced to lie, and ignore, and why we are built...no wait, how we make ourselves adapt to calamities easily and to get over things quickly. because judgement, criticism, and nonfullfillment of expectations never stops.  well, this is what PMS does to me. (p means pre josh, and for me present! grrr)  two cups of coffee, plus sleeping on the couch, plus one mug of hot chocolate =  happiness! well....actually mood swings.  i got up early today (9.30) to go to the zoo for only a couple of hours, to work on the newsletter, because as lauren shapiro puts it, "zuhair doesn't know how to do anything", and as zuhair puts it "i dont feel like working alone, and besides lauren doesn't know anything at all....us bellaire ppl gotta stick together", so i guess i'm the glue that holds ppl together. heeheehe. when my mom heard that i had to go in to the zoo today, she was at first sort of pissed off ("this is why you only weigh 99 lbs!") but then she was sort of proud of me in a twisted sort of way that i was elmer's rep for the blue smurfs, i guess. lol.  anyway...so i got there, and luckily i didn't run into mitchell until 11.30 when he got off for lunch. hahaha. i was trying so hard to be PMS-ing with him that it worked. and then i called josh and had a little escape for awihle. then back to work......oh but dana and lisa came, and showed me around birds and gave me the scoop on all the happenings of birds.....man i am SOOO switching sections next year.   so after what i call lunch (going to the bird gardens with dana and lisa) i got back, and zuhair pestered me into staying until 2.45. wow we actually got the newsletter done really fast this time....only 2 days......and we got done before 4.30 too......i actually left at 3, and u know what? i think it's the best issue like...eVER! i know with a publication like the "ZooCrew Newsletter" it can ONLY get better, but u know what, this newsletter was actually mostly text this time, with no space fillers, and only appropriate pictures. WOW. i actually didn't spazz out (much) before it got printed........  and the news is actually newsowrhty so *whew*.  so me and josh went ot hte museum, and i was a little pissed of cuz i didn't get to change my clothes (stupid mitchell....wasting my time during his lunch break). but once again, my fascination with those zoo shorts actually made me likes the shorts, but i still ended up changing shirts. *whew* good thing too, it actually came in handy later.   the mfah is the SCHIZ!!!!! soooo much better than Nat. Galleries......the layout, the selection.......i mean, if only they housed the masterpieces at mfah...then THAt would be something. it's still great now though.......there's just lesser works of the schizzy artists. :-) must go back.....a very romantic place too.................heeheehee........  anyhows, but when i got back home, i was sort of a little bit down (i guess i had such a good time that an anticlimax sort of happened), so i sat there, tried to watch tv, ate a little bit, and headed over to the computer to see what was happening online. not much.....hari is still going psycho over eleanor's "disappearance", ppl still flickering, etc etc. and then i tried to download and print the correspondence course registration forms but it turns out it required me downloading a whole other application so i've just been sitting here wasting time until it does. ooh....but i got so frustrated that i wrote a poem! heehee......well, a shot in the dark really but i think that takes care of creative energy for a good....well year? haha prolly not since a lot of stuff is going to happen from now on. life is good. even if the poem's connotation doens't seem that way........................  i personally consider it a love poem. to others it might be propaganda. and yet again, it is partially plagiarized (well, a little bit.). and then again....it is still sappy recycled crap but that's the way life is isn'nt it?  sorry rags, it's just a little bit profane. but u know what, i'm at peace after writing it so w/e.....love all you guys! and dont ever be afraid to tell me aNYTHING. i can handle it.   ************************ the tears on my fingers (the moment of weakness)  “life is one big anticlimax” (s)he said it without blinking without thinking how much it would hurt me inside. they say it’s only naïveté  to believe in God’s wonders to believe He will open windows in the dark run-down rusty, musty dusty Victorian mansion of the world. where cynics, heathens and cretins control the air we breathe the love we need even the fucking place we pee! where we mercilessly debate how selfishly, how altruistically, how nobly we can live. and then just brush it off like the dust of our fathers. while innocent young men and women sell their souls to intimidating demons that sit on their stools of evil from OfficeMax and calculate how much purity can be taken until the spawn surpasses the master. all the while fighting and screaming screaming until throats grow hoarse and yet still shouting and ranting! and chanting and chanting! until the losers go crazy and the winner become madder still and believe that – *paranoia*  everybody’s coming to get them to lie to and cheat and steal just to keep from being hungry to maintain their own livelihoods while the world around them, around us tumbles into red-hot stagnation that is the ultimate chaos that awaits us all…! to consume us  to strip us of our souls to suck at our breath until we are the icy cold Golem that roam free even on Earth. Hope, there is but little but yet… perhaps? Maybe? Un peu?! even a cynical French bastard –  no wait a cynical French-hating bastard must agree (Please pardon the rampant, commercialized, necessary-to-get-the-damned-point-across plagiarism) that hope remains while we are true? keeping up those screwed up appearances beating down the barriers we make for ourselves making our own lives a living Hell, while we suck the innocence out of our children and yet still expect them to save our asses for the future. to be real, to be freed to trust again, to feel and to not fear to breathe the sweet air that is outside in the blinding, redeeming light where roaches are afraid to scurry. soaking up the poison that fills our minds and cripples our bodies that shed blue tears and black blood that tastes of bitterness, sponges of our society only wish that they could remedy the pain and suffering of our world. Oh God forbid! that they should ever fail for only they keep us from turning to self-cannibalism by allowing we ingrates to feed upon them while they bite their tongues, knowing it’s the only God-damned way. we feed like vultures like werewolves that know nothing but savagery. failed expectations miserable efforts dodge every corner, waiting to pounce, to dishearten to dismember all we have left so we feed more and more while the anticlimax that is life looms like the shadow. but this is no anticlimax of some fucked up Elizabethan play this is real. Real as nothing can be anymore. I’m not leaving and if you try, i'll hang on to your hand and tether you to my heart so that you CAN’T! even if you don’t understand if it turns out to be fake after all then at least we put up a good fight and made our own climax to this sad story. but hope is real it has to be it must be I NEED IT TO BE…  *******************  yep, and that's it. the summer is still atrophic. erg................................  and life is still unfair. but oh well........we have to get through it.......so i'm going to stop bitching and do something with it. lol.  love you guys....  wo ai ni je t'aime  ani ohevet ot'ach m'od m'od, kol hazman..........  jane

      i went to rice w/ some family friends this afternoon. i saw the pool there... hmm it's interesting how at msu they actually let you swim in the real pool... the one they used for competitions and such. but at rice, it's just some sort of "fitness pool/aquatic center" or maybe rice doesn't have a swim team or host tournaments... anyways, even though the pool wasn't the huge standard sized one i expected, it was pretty good considering it was indoors and such. we're going tomorrow! ^_^  wow... it's so freaky all the things you can find out about yourself from the ppl that have known you since you were born. so this family that i went to the pool w/, the husband has known my dad since high school... and they even went to the same college to teach and stuff. so of course i spent much of my childhood in china playing w/ their daughter (wen), who is a year younger than me.  apparently, i was a vicious little urchin when i was five or so... i bullied everyone cuz they were younger than me... and made them eat dirt and such... hehe so the mother of wen tells me this story that i don't remember: we were running to preschool one day and my mom was w/ us, when wen fell and scraped her knee or something. she then turns and bites my mom.  the mother speculates that i did something to provoke wen... such as push her to the ground or something... but i can't remember. anyways, wen tries to nail another such incident on me... once when we were little the boy that now lives in austin got a huge bump on his head. wen's mom says she hit him, but wen says i did. well, knowing that i had a short temper and was consumed by power (i was head of class and could slap the sleepers during class and such... hehe), i think that it is very probable... since wen is quite docile  and that leads me to something else... one time when i was in england, me and my dad were on the bike riding home over this hill when the bike toppled over. i immediately asked whether my dad was alright and tried to help him up... but the reason behind such care as is not usually demonstrated by me has stuck in my head even after all these years. you see, even though my grades were better than everyone, my parents were not content w/ my behavior. they often compared me to wen or that boy in austin. they'd say things like "how come she always obeys her parents? why can't you be more like her?" i'm not one to forget... so i guess on that occasion in england i tried to be "more like her." man i'm so twisted... of course all that is history now... after the spanking outside a library when my dad was reproved by this english lady.  i think  that  is the real reason i protested at going to austin so much... i didn't want to be compared to both of them... again. they are perfect examples of how chinese children should act. they work hard at school and are obedient at home. i am not... but i've given up trying to be more like them to make the comparisons stop. i realized that it would never end. i would never be good enough for their standards. they would only find someone else to compare me to... liang, jane, the rest of my friends, children of co-workers... "how come you're not like them?!?" "she got into harvard! will you?"  in the end they dragged me there and afterwards told me that the parents thought my behavior was "good."  great.

      i wake up to the alarm clock at 8:10... only to press the snooze button every 9 min. until 9:00. hehe. talked to someone until like 1:30... ^_^  so anyways... jane decided to pull a fast one on me and calls from the zoo at like 1:30 to tell me that the newsletter was due today and she wanted my orangutan! as usual... w/o prior warning i had not even started on it yet... i was all sorts of alarmed... hehe but through the blipping on my cell i found out the #'s of the ppl i needed to call (even though zuhair and jane had an argument about the area code: it's 713!!!! no... houston's not giving out any more 713 #'s... it's 832!!!)  i called the first number (the publicist person) to check to see if i could do an interview, but i got this lady's voice on the answering machine... and was like... woah... that wasn't supposed to happern! hehe. but then i called the 2nd # (the orangutan keepers) and found out that it was an umbridge-sounding lady at the other end of the line who had no idea what i was talking about. so i'm starting to think that the zip code was 832 after all... and was about to send the blue smurfs an email telling them so... when i press the redail key on my phone and discover that i had dialed 553 instead of 533... whoops...  that  would have made a difference.... hehe  so i dial the #'s correctly and get the approval and then the info i needed... finish the article, and attach it to a yelling email (i wish we had howlers in real life... ^_~) directed at jane and zuhair for not telling me that it was due today.  but then jane calls at 4 and is all like, did you send it? they check but can't open the attach. (what version of windows do you have anyways??) so i had to send it again in the body of the message... *shudders* that is soooo beyond unprofessional... haha  apparently jane and mitchell are "cool" no more. he's become a xi... ahh!!! but hey, at least i don't have to worry about you getting assulted at work anymore.  what does gigli mean? what language is that word in?  man... i feel bad. zuhair is disapointed (is that the word i should use?) that i don't talk to him anymore... the only place i see him is at the zoo... and only at lunch on tuesdays... but he's all like "you don't even come to lunch anymore..." i'm really sorry... btw, does he know about this blog? anyways, i'll try to talk online or call or something... i haven't forgotten you! remember the fish and the frog! good times... good times... hahaha  jane and i want to do something friday night... since we are sick of meyerland.... don't do the galleria thing... and aren't really interested in any of the movies that have come out this summer... we don't know what else to do (besides see the sound of music at the pavilion dealie...)!!!! help us... whoever reads this thing... haha

      what a WONDERFUL day turned horribly weird turned horrible turned LOVELY peachy keen day!  lol........well basically here's the scoop.  well me and josh went out last night (dinner and barnes and noble   and then at like 12.30 i couldn't sleep and i called eleanor (who finally saw finding nemo   prank calling was FUN though! lol...here's how it went:  - first person was going to be awesome. we looked up somebody named "warzell booty (yah i know, if it was me i'd wonder why i let myself have an actual last name like that)" and we practiced this chinese food bit that's all like, "u order flied lice? we outside u house and u owe 99 dollar!" and then we'd say his address heeheehee. dammit, nobody picked up. weird thing was, that guy lives 2 blocks from eleanor's old house.  - then we decided to call someone we knew. so we called rags....we were going to be dentists and be like "ur appointment was at 3.30...wher are u? we will have to double bill you!" lol for like some really screwed up dental work: 5 filings for 8 cavities, and have "rags" carved in andplated in gold on his front teeth. lol. sorry - but still, nobody was picking up. i thought maybe josh might have been up, or at least he would wake up and we could fool around a little. so we prepared this cool little act where we would switch off voices, and together we'd be "desiree" and we try and hit on him. hahahaha. but alas, nobody picked up. - so we thought it'd be awesome if we prank called shaft of all ppl. i'd put on a french accent and be from the sylvan learning center, and we'd be doing this outreach program thing bc he's dyslexic, and ms korman recommended him, and i'd be all like, it's ok mat, we're trying to help you. and eleanor (if we could restrain ourselves from laughin) would be a qualified professional and talk to him all babyish and be like oh, it's ok that you dont undersatnd what's going on right now, that's why we're here. but the little fucker disconnected his phone already. grr - so of course, last resorts. we called danny. i put on the french accent again, and pretened that i was "mercerdes vargas" and that eleanor and "shannon" were just over for a three some and that he really missed out and should have come..............lol but the crazy idiot just sat there and hung on the line while i kept saying "hello......daniel daniel daniel" in that really freaky french accent. heeheehee.   but even that was sort of pointless. oh well.........it's ok  my mom's hanging over my shoulder right now, and she's all "so when u type, do u look at the screen or at hte keyboard?" and im all, er...the screen of course, and she's like "well dont u forget where to put the fingers, etc" and im all......that is the point of typing mom. *wow*  anyway.......so pretty sooon after that, i go to sleep. hmmm.....i wake up, and then i go to the zoo and look terrible bc of hte whole u know...not sleeping thing. but i actually feel peachy, and i get to do filing for elena. fun fun.......man i wish i got paid. see if i got paid i could deal with it. it actually pretty much is really funny looking at ppl's controlled substance tests...of course i'm not like snooping, nobody gets hired and fails it, but the stack of tests from rejectees is all like, PCP: positive, marijuana: positive, cocaine: positive......haha. there was once this guy who tested positive for all four of them. what was hte other one? oh right...heroin. heeheehee.  anyway........at hte zoo, i met mitchell again. i knew him last year but he was a bit of a recluse, and i think i scared him away with my stalker bit. anyway, so he's a lot more easygoing this year and stuff. he's pretty nice, a little weird, but very interesting. we actually ended up staying late (me, yue, eleanor, him) unti like 6.30 talked and stuff in the BEC. wow we are dorks.   anyway, yah i think......wait a sec....know that i was prolly a little whore today concerning that, and i really regret that. wow......when eleanor starts silently judging you know you have gone over the edge. not that i dont value yue's opinion but she's very realistic and u know i'm always going wrong. so i went home, felt guilty as crap, called josh, talked it over, got online, talked it over some more......and i guess i feel better but now he is just worried and i knw i need to give him a reason not to be. and he's going to get it......mitchell may be nice, but he is a manwhore from lanier (though i must say, one of the nicer ones) that i wouldn't want to date. end of story.  i'm sorry josh...i really do love you, and like you said, "emet ze ahava" so you have nothing to worry about. i'm sure nobody would disagree with me on that......  yue: do u want to come with me and meena on our little officemax excursion tomorrow? what do u want to do on friday............?  love all you guys......you make me come, you make me complete, you make me completely miserable......  but i'm having the time of my life while you guys are at it so keep up the good work! life is peachy, and i shall remain chipper evermore.   love you guys lots! calamity jane   ps go see yue's pics...jason looks like the slob that he is, and paul looks demonic!

      i believe you jane. you don't have to keep sending me emails about how you didn't go out w/ josh on friday... i trust that you didn't.  anyways... here i am in austin! hehe there are actual hills here, unlike houston where the only elevation change you experience is in going up and down the skyscrapers... and there are trees up the schizza (some that look like they are growing on top of other ones) and mosquitoes that are quite potent in preventing me from seeing the fireworks. if you want to see the bite marks... i took pics! haha i know i know... i'm insane... ;)  and the congregation of azn parents are now commenting on my photography skills... when they can't even control the zoom so that you can see the heads of the ppl in the pics. oh well... it just means that they can't take pics of me! what a relief...  we left yesterday in THE worst weather imaginable. it was pouring... like someone was just dumping buckets of water on top of us. i mean... there were no "rain drops" anymore. and on the highway (still storming like mad) we thought we could see a tornado forming... scary.  i slept some of the way... cuz i brought my pillow and terry cloth blanket w/ me. i read the football book a little bit too. we stopped at kfc to get a bite to eat... and got to the peeps' apt. at around 4:40. we gorged and then drove around... to this cliff thing where we could have seen the fireworks... if it weren't for the mosquitoes that attacked us and left me scars to prove it. we also saw this dam thingy... but it was closed so we couldn't go across it (normally you could have walked across the thing while the water was running). driving in austin is tough... i would not want to take my driver's license test here... the hills are insane... and half the time when you are on them you can't see the ground right in front of you... man...  i tried to send rags a text message yesterday but it didn't get through. but i dreamt that it did and he replied... the only normal dream i've had in a while.  today we drove around UT and saw LBJ library... the gifts from other heads of state exhibit was awesome... but also shocking. cuz i saw these two elephant tusks (polished and carved, of course) that were the height of me (isn't it kinda illegal to hunt them?)... haha my parents thought that the jhula from indira ghandi was a swing for little children.  my parents (actually just me dad) have this bet/challenge thing going on w/ the other kids. he wants them to attend the same college as i do. man... he'll prolly reserve us 3 grave sites together if he could. :/  the deal was that i come on friday and go back on saturday... but now my dad is keeping me for another day... and i won't have another change of clothes... so i'm gonna stink up the town... or they will go shopping... bleh!!!

      oh, i KNEW i'd forgotten something.  well first on that bit with the dreams. er........those are pretty disturbing dreams. well not so much disturbing as confusing. haha maybe we could use a copy of "dream oracle" with us. or maybe not, i'd bet it would be like "coal - signifies that you will soon be receiving a large tax refund". *shakes head*. but at least ur still dreaming, keeps life intersting. i figure maybe i'm just too exhausted to dream anymore....but i dunno. i miss them.......  and of course, life is still very humdrum. i think that's why ur dreams are being weird and mine are inexistent. let's do something....not like a meyerland thing, but something really cool. i dunno. maybe we just have to have school functions since we're underage and lacking cars and licenses. why dont u come with us to a debate meeting? kind of stupid but there's always cool stuff to do at UH. let's go play DDR!!! pweez....eleanor works too hard.  oh right, and the thing i forgot to post earlier. heeheehee......i was in the DC like handling hte carft (coloring on animal stencils for instant pics), and these really nice couple comes in with their daughter. the mom is really pretty, and she's dressed like a college student (cept it's obvious she's not cuz she's like...30 or soemthing) and the dad is too, cept he's also a bit aged. lol. well anyways, they're all talking in french and stuff to their daughter (i gleaned from the convo that her name was elise), and then they ask me for a piece of paper. yep, they knew that much english, but while elise was coloring i was talking to the mom, and im all "so r u guys from france" and she's all "yes, from paris". and my mind is slowly blowing at this point.....a real life french nuclear family! smartly dressed, cosmopolitan, nice to their kids, prepared. *heaven* they even had the stereotypical accent thing going on. well, not as badly as that docent from the BEC so it wasn't even cheesy. but then i wonder why they're in houston. so i ask "so are you guys on vacation or seomthing?" and she gives me this lashy stare and smiles, and then i'm all "oh...um.....vous prenez les vacances?" and she's all like "oh...oui oui". lol if i hadnt been so full of it for conversing in french to a french person, i prolly woulda asked why the crap anyone would want to vacation in HOUSTON, especially such cool french ppl, but oh well. i gave elise another piece of paper and that was it. well.....except for the "au revoirs". after 2 more hours of sitting in the DC musing, i think i've got it figured out. they're either really rich or really stupid. since i didn't think they were stupid (they were a  young chic couple after all), i think they're just rich and running out of places to visit. but i still wonder........ houston ????? oh  well. lol.  back to debate stuff. must work.....make eleanor feel better.................and show up tomorrow with beacoup de cards so i can spite henry and daniel. avinash reassigned our case to them, and we got rachel's. *tear* and we coulda done really well with it had we the time. oh well.....at least now we know there is such thing as lexis legal. haha.  ciao dude je t'aime

      wow, what a dismal weekend ahead of me.  first off, i stayed up late last night to finish Harry Potter. drowsiness was catching up with me around 1.30 AM, so i sort of rushed the last 100 pages. but that didn't matter, i could tell it was a dismal ending. ur right.....not exactly what i wanted, nor what u wanted either. it was just.....really really lame. a prophecy? geez, we had no idea harry was going to defeat voldemort! begeezus....  the rest was all right, cept i didn't catch that part u mentioned where hermione and ron are snogging. i mighta thought him staying out late to practice quidditch at night was just him and hermione off in a closet somewhere, but nope. and that cho thing......geez. she's such a weird shallow little..........player. i dunno, she's not like anyone we know. and i hope we never do.  i'm not going to condemn the rest of it for anything except predictability and wordiness. lol. but alli n all, i suppose it is enuff to continue my mild interest. geez i wish LOTR would hurry up and come out already!!! but watch me be really lazy and have it be not until the 3rd movie comes out that i get it.....lol. sure hope it doesn't sell out. and i will remember to get the widescreen version this time. fullscreen makes me feel really stupid.  sorry about your parents dude......i wish we coulda talked more. but dont worry about the galleria thing, i predicted it would be a dismal time, i still think it would have been, and i dont think i really ever wanted to go except to make liang stop thinking i was a horrible bitch. but anyhows, it's raining (=me in a bad mood), my parents are out (=no ride), and rags says nobody we really know is even there (=why the crap would i go?) besides liang. as for the lanier people....oh well. debate rules life. heeheehee.  hope u enjoy austin...when are you leaving? well, on the bright side at least you get to not see barbara for another week. AHHHH alligators is CRAZY!!! lol so much work...so much acting involved. me, sarah, and nika were practicing it and sarah c. and bennet come over and start giving like acting lessons. but all in all when we did the show it really really sucked below our expectations/level of practice. the alligator couldn't run so the whole run sequence went awry, the crowd kept shouting so we could barely be heard, and the Q/A session at the end just didn't go much at all besides the diff b/t crocs + alligators since the stupid idiot who played Sam (i.e. me) hadn't prepared anything informational besides the stuff in the script which was just minimal. tell me.....how the crap did you guys pull it off the first time? sarah said u guys were FANTASTIC. who were u? haha i'd like to see you as the captain.  oh, even though i already sent u an explanation, i still can't believe u would think i'd lie and say i was seeing josh this weekend. seriously i'm NOT; it's his bro's bar mitzvah. it's ok though, i know my precedents will have indicated otherwise. lol......but come on! heehee, the last time i ran out on the easter egg hunt with jason, you were actually with me so you can't talk. *wink*  i can't believe they're still having a debate meeting tomorrow. oh get this: eleanor was feeling sort of lousy yesterday and she said "jane, tell me something to make me feel better" since her hospital volunteering thing got pushed back by beaurocracy another week. i said "well...i finished typing up all the debate files." which was a load of crap, considering i haven't even got all the files, and i hadn't even started typing the ones i had. but it's ok......lol she felt loads better so it was worth it. and since i'm not doing anything today till dinner, guess what i'm spending this afternoon doing? yep, debate. lol......but it's ok, i've been such a lazy bum this summer. i haven't even touched the clarinet.......stupid incentives.  rags....go pick up ur music!!!! or do u want me to call me for u to tell them to send it to weslayan?  oh, so anyway i finally got around to downloading "neshika" . heehee...i got rags to do it too, but he hasnt gotten back to me on how he likes it. well anyhow, as u heard last night, i was dancing around in my room to it for a good half hour, just like when i downloaded "all the things she said". and just for kicks, i danced around to that afterwards.........haha. i'm such a weirdo. but anyway, now i'm bored.  i want to go to mfah!!!! le musee d'orsay......*cough* we must! lol.   c you soon. i expect i'll call you tonight............  how come rags never told me he had webshots? grr

      even freakier dream: there's this kid (built much like dudley) on our street who sits at the window everyday waiting for someone to give him coal (i dunno??) and he gets violent if he does not get two piece everyday. so i passed by the kitchen and stole a piece of coal to give to him and walk home. rags is there. we kiss and i'm like i need to give the kid another piece of coal and i stand up to leave, but rags prevents me from getting it.  another part of that dream (i think?): it's the first day of school and this teacher that really likes me for no apparent reason gives us a pop quiz and actually takes the grade. i get a 10% on it and she's all like don't worry. but i sit there calculating what i need to get on everything else to get an A....  i just hope that tonight's dream isn't strange... but by the pattern i see they are getting increasingly incoherent as i go along. i think that my brain is just putting bits and pieces of stuff that i thought about but stored in the back of my head together and just linking everything that happens together w/o any logic of cause vs. effect.

      zoo was dismal... yet again, except for a few bright points: 1. barbara won't be here next week cuz she's going on vacation 2. i didn't screw up the skit too badly 3. it rained, although it didn't help the crowds too much 4. i got to see someone on tuesday at lunch ^_^  haha the zoo attracts more than a few stupid and mean ppl... here's some questions/attitudes you can expect: 1. is that a texas longhorned snake? 2. do bats come from rats? 3. is that frog/mouse/earthworm alive? 4. are the spiny lizards called spiny lizards b/c they have a spine? 5. ZC: excuse ma'am, but drinks/food are not allowed inside the discovery center. would you mind leaving it outside?     mother A: hmph! *storms off and drags child(ren) w/ her*     mother B: well then. why do you sell drinks/zoo at the zoo?! 6. mother: is that cockroach real?     ZC: yup. it's a madagascar hissing cockroach... the largest of its kind     mother: EWWWWW IT'S DISGUSTING     *a second later*     mother: come here *insert child's name*. go touch the cockroach. 7. ZC: it looks like it's gonna rain, doesn't it?     lady:  well , it's not going to rain on  us  8. adults have acted like they didn't know what they were doing wrong when they tried to help their kid  steal  a puppet from the play area 9. a teenager was dismayed when caught stealing two puppets from the play area *A:  ahhh man !*  no wonder barbara is so pissy on mondays... i mean after 5 days of that ^ i would be too.  oh FIY: the zoo it making it legal to sell beer on its premises... and while people aren't allowed to smoke... they blow their fumes on you anyway.  apparently it's wrong for me to take a nap when i feel tired. it makes them assume  all sorts  of things that i could have done wrong. maybe i'll go on a hunger strike. that seems to be the only way i can get leverage now. ugh  jane: yup i was still sleeping when you called at 6:30. and also i hope you've DLed the songs i told you to.  rags: your music is at the store (sugar land). go pick it up or ask them to transfer it to another store.  haha so much for my plans to go running today. when i went outside before lunch... it was blinding... and after i ate lunch... well you know what happened. got tired (or drowsy?) and slept for like 2.5 hrs before my mom yelled me awake.  oh gawd... i think they may make me go to austin on friday after all. i've already told them that saturday is the earliest i will leave houston... and that i have no intention of meeting up w/ their college buddies... but how useless was that?!?!?!

      not that i blame either of them but two men in my life are making it considerably more difficult.  rags is accusing me of wasting my time, and that's the reason i dont get stuff done every night, and thats the reason i'm tired. therefore, i should stay in marching band just to make it into wind ensemble to prove something to myself, despite its killing me.  my dad is now going off on a tangent about how my innate irresponsiblity led to someone breaking into my band locker. rolls eyes.......  josh where are you? chris has said something to indicaton that u broke the news to ur mom....

      geez...i'm sorry. yah u prolly should have gone to foster. i originally thought u shouldn't go because you had no idea what you were doing, but i forgot that NCX is all about experience, and ur right nobody else knows what they're doing either.  dammit, i'm sure you guys could have won. oh well..ur rihgt, there's always deer park. but i feel bad so remind me to be your perssonal CCX bitch these two weeks.  well, in most other aspects of my life, i am also losing it. i've talked to almost nobody this week....and to those i have talked to, it was just not the same. i always had something else on my mind: school. and despite all this taking-over-of-my0life, i still forgot a lot of stuff and didnt get stuff done in time.....  mr allen shall kill me.  damn i need to quit something.  well i just spent a hundred bucks on barnes and noble .com, and then like 30 on circuit city.com. i thought shopping would make me feel better but it hasn't: i bought school stuff......ugh.  the only thing i need now is to watch SLC punks, and i'll be set to quit school, steal a car, break up with josh, and start over a new life as a hick secretary in kansas.  life is sweet.  somebody call me.....my parents have forbade me from making calls. oh yah, that's another thing. they're being eerily nice. i went out yesterday to "eleanor'sh ouse" and they knew i was lying because eleanor came over to MY house looking for me, and then they didn't even bug me (too much) about it. me and my mom were watching tv and she just turned around and asked me, nice and motherly-like (WOWOWOWOWOW that in itself is a miracle) "you sure you dont want to tell me where you really were?". and my dad.......he just gave me his credit and was like : buy what you need online. maybe the trust level is rising......and now i dont even have the will or time to or energy to abuse it.  yue, call me!  poor david.  jane

      jane... dude. you need to stop taking those pills! ^ just a little counsel from your mother that may save your life. geezus.  i'm sure you'd be trilled to read this: A recent review undertaken by Health Canada has considered the numerous studies dealing with caffeine and its potential health effects. It has re-confirmed that for the average adult, moderate daily caffeine intake at dose levels of 400-450 mg/day is not associated with any adverse effects. Data has shown, however, that women of childbearing age and children may be at greater risk from caffeine.   anyway... why did you tell me not to sign up for foster?!? hehe most of the ncx ppl had no idea what they were doing... but oh well, no need to complain about what "could/would have happened", right? there's always deer park.  hehe maybe you and rach could organize a CCAA (caffeine and cigarrette addicts anonymous) and BOTH QUIT. i really don't understand how his voice is so clear but the air he exhales still smells like smoke...  ahh... the enigmas of life...  i need to practice guitar. ^_^

      i just wanted to post beofre i went to bed. we got back from foster around 12.30. me and eleanor didn't break, i guess i wasn't expecting it too much. ok fine, i was but i surprisingly dont care. i feel satisfied....all my rounds were good debates, i did what i had to do. get into the groove.....deer park shall be better. but remind me to start forcing eleanor into practice rounds and to make her sleep more. she was pretty out of it today....poor thing  they had fraps at a debate tourney. WOW  i just finished a really sketchy EPA DA and emailed it to rach. yep, i dnno why i do this even though i didnt break. poor rach...he's so awesome and i really know he needs this.   i had the freakiest convo with the senior LDers on the bus on the way back......they are all more disturbing and cool than i ever thought. at least THEY respect me.  apparently even henry and daniel do despite a facade of distaste. they were teling rach about me and eleanor at deer park.   i'm tired. and cranky. and hungry. and pretty dirty.....oohhh rob's trail mix!  i'm incoherent too............thank God for weekends..............  i think t's a good thing i didn't break.   haha...funny things at foster today:  - meena was dressed like a stalker. well, she WAS one. doing reconnaiscance missions for rach. - aww.......more ppl called me and eleanor seniors today. apparently we seem "educated". - stubbs got the whole bus to stop at eleanor's house. sweet of him (everyone was like WOW he did that for u and he's not even mad?), but embrassing for her. - i finally learned how to answer K's w/o framework debate. SWEET...stupid shaft - i ran PFCM as a major arg today. it was fun.......but i sorta had no idea what i was doing. josh, talk to me about that one. - i actually spread analytics today. oh SHIT - once again, we lost to 3 K's.  - Topicality Increase - Def. Increase means to increase in love    violation - the aff doesn't do the plan out of love for nature, therefore they aren't topical. we had this run against us. it was fun. i quoted finding nemo. and then i scared myself by degrading the nature of love. oh well, i won the arg. can u believe we lost the round? stupid eco fem - stubbs sort of...yah. we hit aquaculture. we didnt have files. stubbs had the files and idn't xerox them. nice move. - kevin got tall, his voice got deeper. wow, he's really hot now. he asked to me play cards; i felt honored cuz i thought he was ignoring me.   all for now. oh god i'm tired.  ruishi put "bellaire's favorite things" on his xanga. but he thought i ws the author. haha. he's so funny. as all lders are. -_-

      i can't believe we didn't rush home to blog about the first day of sophomore year.  then again, i can.  tired as crap.....dont have time/energy to say anything except that only freaks do this to themselves.   buy the TPP!!!!!  i think one rob rumble put it best: (even though he ended buying the TPP from VARUN of all people)  "Josh, you are my inspiration for this piece.  Oh, and you're all sick for thinking that.  Bellaire's Favorite Things  Senile teachers and last-minute cramming Crazy tree people and stupid flim-flamming Finishing papers just as the bell rings These are a few of my favorite things  Integrals, series, and slopes for good measure Firehouse Pizza, a mint for my pleasure Feelings of freedom that happen in spring These are a few of my favorite things  Fire alarms that go off every hour The other guy's food that I promptly devour Counting down seconds until the bell rings These are a few of my favorite things  When I bomb tests When homework mounts When I'm feeling sad I simply remember my favorite things And then I don't feel so bad"  detachment sure helps too.........

      wow. i'm so bored i have nothing speical to blog about, except:  - my mom is a freaky lady! she tried to hug me after i took a shower and only had a towel on... i was all like "no mom, get off!!!" and she wanted to sneak into those movies w/ "her friends" i mean, what kind of people does she work w/ anyway? - dress suits??? is that like the thing you had? haha i don't understand half the rules rach laid out for bellaire debators... quite pathetic, i know, i know! - cardboard boxes should work... no need to go so fancy for the first time trial, right? or maybe i'm just really cheap. oh well... all i know is that splurging on bins might be a waste, cuz it's more of a function thing than an appearance thing? ooo! and w/ the money we save... t-shirts (ads) maybe? haha i'm gone crazy w/ power! - dude... i don't have those smileys on my incredimail! not fair! you must have the newer version! bleh. oh btw, all those aim upgrades that they try to coerce you into... i don't notice the changes? - wow. jenni zhou's in varsity belles. and she's a FRESHMAN!!! dude, she must be awesome!

      a wudge is....well it's sort of a jane/naeem thing.  "wink wink nudge nudge" --> "wudge wudge"  heehee  dude today was pretty dismal. i didnt do anything all day. i didn't have anything to do. dont with debate, no world history book, nowhere to go.  so i went joggint to bellaire and back. i checked on my streets software, it's about 3 miles. hooray! i did it all in 40 minutes, but odnt worry i'm not THAT slow. walking time included of course. heehee. then i got home and i felt all nasty...so i took a shower. but it creeped the living daylights outa me to come home finding my mom watching a documentary about how proxima centauri will explode soon and all the gamma rays will kill all but hte most sheltered species of earth.  so then i was bored. did random things.  oh but here's something that been pissing me off. well, three things actualy. four if you separte the last two incidents.  1) jonathan earl is a dumbass. i handed in my coral reef file today, and apparently they were having some sort of "cx hierarchy" meeting yesterday is stubbs' office. i walked in to give rach my file, and i did, andt hen i sort of invited myself to stay. i was pretty fucking hurt that i wasn't invited to this, but naeem glossed it over pretty well. i stayed. and then last night, pretyt late, jonathon earl pops up on justin's sn and sttarts chastizing me....can u believe that? jonathan EARL of all people chastizing ME on JUSTIN's sn. well, beofre i knew it ws jon, i was pretty pissed off at justin anyway. just another way he doesn't respect me and eleanor. and when i found ot it was jon, i was even more pissed because i KNOw he doesn't respect us. dude...so here's the deal. me and eleanor recut rachel shen's file on coral reefs because *der* that the assignment. apparently he was aghast at the fact that i didn't give her any credit for it, and now she was sort of upset about it. well, i was sorry that she was upset cuz she's an awesome person and stuff, so i told him that he could put her name on the file. well, no this jerkass continues for 10 minutes about how you dont "just recut someone else's file", "not give them any credit", "you shoudl put her name on it", "she's really upset", etc etc. while i sat there aim screaming at him in caps about how i was sorry about it, how he could change it if he wanted to, how i didn't know but i would do so in the future. all the while, naeem tells me it doens't really matte anyway. ugh. so then....he finally realizes that i dont hae the fucking file anymore (even though i turned it in to rach RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM and how justin was mentioning it to him already....), and he's like "oh". and then he warns me a couple times for kicks. so basically this is pissing me off bc a) i get defnesive about my work ALWAYS and 2) he apparently respects us so little, all he notices are the flaws and nothing else. nada. if it wasn't for rach and eleanor i swear i'd quit this stupid ass debate team. the patriarchy is up the schiz.......  2) so rach sends this email with the tentative partners for the year. i notice somthing wrong with it (hari's not on it, and meena is therefore misplaced) and i go "what happnd to hari?" and then he replies to me with this creepy, self-pitying email. then he decides to im me, thanking me for inquiring after his well-being. well i couldn't ignore that gesture, no matter how misconstrued it was, so i unblock him and decide to vent out all my rage onto him for fucking me up with yue and raghu, of course with a warning that said all he ahd to do was sit tight and it would all be over. so this jerkass decides to keep whining about how he's sorry, how he's never loved anyone before besides me, how i led him on......how he merely "misquoted" what he said to yue and raghu........... so i'm all raging at him in caps and then i bllocked him again and told him i would try it again later. *whew* blood pressure: i dont wanna know.  3) so i had nothing to do today at all. obviously, as i went jogging.oh wow, wait this makes 5 things i am mad about. i went to bellaire to drop off some kleenex, and then i took out josh's bio book and started looking thru it to see if we really needed to "borrow" it in april, and then this really crazy bitch comes by ( a fish, from what she was talking about: french 2 with ms simon) in her cute little red short shorts and then she does one oft hose fake coughs really loudly  like *cough* are you KIDDING ME? *cough* because apparently she thought i was a dork and was reading my books before school started. *rolls eyes* that shouldn't bother me because she is a bitch and there is nothing wrong with what i was doing or what she thought i was doing but since i'm on a roll i'm going to add it to my list of major peeves....  4) so anyway after i got home and figured out eleanor wasn't either, i asked my mom if there was naythings he wanted me to do. i had already done some laundry for her, and i was bored again so she's all "make dinner. ther's a chken thawing in the sink, and make some vegetables and make some rice too." well, i dont how much blind faith/overly high expectations (second one) she puts in me, because then she just left, went to her room, and started watching some chinese soaps on DVD.  andt hen i spend the next two hours laboring over the three basics of a chinese meal (rice, veggie, meat) and then i am all proud of myself later because even though i KNOW it's horrible, i did it all by myself and is tll considred it to be edible. well my mom comes out while i am on the phoen with josh and then starts complaining about how i baked it, instead of made soup (you NEVEr bake hens, they only make soup!) and i'm all "well i'm sorry, it's too late and besides you never told me what to do with it", and then she  is all like "w/e...when your dad comes hom i'm telling him you made it and then you can see what HE thinks." and i'm all "go away" bc i thought my dad would undersatnd. so my dad comes home....and apparently he doesn't. even though i have had no culinary training wahtsoever, and has previous experience with my cooking, he still goes off about how the chicken is horrible, and then continues to insult me further by ordering pizza on the phone. begeezus. it was NOT that bad. i ate it myself, i ate a lot actually. and it was NOT bad. i'm like, "just try it", and then he takes a tiny nibble, makes a face, and then declares it to be horrible. well, i maybe could have dealth with that if he would have shut up right then, but nooooo he decides to go on and on about it, and then while washing the dishes because he "punished" me by making me wash dishes, he continues to ramble on and on about how i should have watche dmy mom make dinner every nght, how i should ahve somehow recognized that it was a hen, not a chiekn from the bare naked skin, how i am ahorrible cook and a failure in everything i have ever done, especially this. this, coming from the guy who thought i was a good debater, then went off at me and eleanor on the night we lost semis to crosby A at pearland and failed to qual for state. somebody reall does need to do something for those schizophrenics.  and THEN he continues to ramble about how, where, when and hw many bins i should buy for SEA because i am apparently incompetent at everything. more nick picking continues with how apparently didn't stack the dishes right, and when i go to fix it he continues and i blow a fuse and start screaming about hw he oesn't need to repeat himself 10 times when it comes to criticisms, especially as i am on my way to fixing it. THEN he goes on about how i spend too much time blogging. then he settles onto the couch to read those damn chinese newspapers.  *whew* i'm tired. i would leave that "parental expectations" brochure out for him, but i know he'd just throw it away. i thikn i'll hang it up in my locker for a few laughs......  phillip's finally burned those movies i wanted. hooray! lol....but now i have to cough up some cash for him. lol.......ift here's one thing my dad's good for, it's for randomly handing out cash.  someone remind me to call david. i'm bad at that.  jane

      i was looking through the old emails today. from my michigan people. from my pershing people. from people i do not see or talk to anymore. so i (naturally) started crying/thinking. how does one let go? rags brought up a very good point. you do not "lose" someone if you can still remember them. but if you haven't kept up with them, people change, and aren't they as good as a stranger to you now anyway? you don't really "know" them if you've lost touch. and the friendship can't be there after all these years. heh i'm like the communist govt. of china: new era=destroy the past... but i want to reconnect with some of the old people. i know, i know that sounds really idiotic of me... but these are the people that i grew up with, the people that shaped my childhood, and in some ways the people who have helped me to find "self". i have the email adds ready, so only one question is hindering me: do they still remember me?  oh well, there's only one way to find out.  >.<

      so, hari is being stupid again. after trying to guilt me into "being his friend again" (well, i just want to be your friend.....i really am sorry...i thought that this wouldnt be too much to ask.....i'll see you around again if it's not too much trouble....i thought u'd be nice enought to forgive me.....) he then goes to rags for some pity, who believes him. i dont blame him, but man this is really screwed up. why doesn't he just go back to california. and NO i am not being cold, he apparently wants to go back anyway so he should just stop dragging everything out.  ok, enough bitcing for one day. i told myself i wouldn't do that anymore......*case closed* (as long as hari learns to leave me the fuck alone)  jane

      ok, webshots is continuing to not work on this computer. i dont know why either....man...w/e. i dont know if i'm going to get on the laptop anytime soon though, since my mom is always on it, but maybe tomorrow. haha, but alright alright..i will blog i will blog. while downloading songs. and running from the dining room trying to eat dinner.  band camp was absolutely dismal. of course i always knew it was going to be dismal physically, but man i didn't know it was going to be THAT dismal. we haven't had a practice like that since UIL last year, and that wasn't over consecutive days! i got to skip half of that bc of debate too.....dammit. lol. so, it being hte middle of a heat wave, he was more generous than usual with his water breaks (one every 45 minutes on mon, tues, and wed, and 1 each on thurs and fri   but MAN...i didn't believe chris or robby when they said mr allen was taking the fun out of band. i do now. we can't do anything fun anymore....we play stupid music, and we march like ants. he wont let us do "the groove", or "iron man" anymore, only "pretty fly" . we tried to do that ass-rubbing thing at the pep rally (when the gym was EMPTY after it was ove) and he came over and like threatened to kick us out of band. OMG. all he cares about now is practice, practice, and getting 1s at UIL. dude...we're just not the school destined to practice a lot and get one's. we go to freaking bellaire where half of us have really important things that we have to do BESIDES band. i'm quoting him "you have to LIVE, EAT, and BREATHE BAND ALL THE TIME!". :-O  well, i still need my PE credits, and i still need something for college apps and i'm still scared of PE so i'll stick it out for two more years. ugh...though. i'm going to shut up now since i dont like whiners who dont take advice.  speaking of which....josh thinks i/we(the band) are too obsessed with impressing people. hmm..i argued for a little bit, and then i realized there was a lot of truth in that comment....but then again, isn't everything i DO just because i want to impress people? i'm sure you are too.........it's...what the hemann twins do. haha....and then again, i'm sure academic challenge also has a lot of practical use. *wink*. lol....w/e.  so, eleanor's phone is no more, and now i'm deprived. on wednesday night, she came to my house, and then when she was informed i wasn't there, she was waiting outside for me for like an hour (i didn't come home till like 10.30) and then we just walked aruond and talked for another 45 minutes, when i came home to the lecture of a lifetime from my parents........  so, what happened was this: josh was coming to pick me up from band practice, and i told my dad that i would call if and when i needed him to pick me up, but he decied to come anyway...so i told my dad "i'm having dinner with some band peeps, really they're leaving already, i'll be home in half anh our". i thought i could get away with it though cuz would he really have expected me to eat dinner and come home in half an hour? lol...so we went out to eat and stuff.....and of course i got home late, and they were all "what the crap, u said dadada....". apparently my dad thought when i said "they" i meant the ppl who were going to deliver the food to the band room (riiiiight) so he went back to school in half an hour and bada bing, i wasnt there. they were pissed. for once i thought i wouldn't fight it, be "responsible" and fess up to my "wrondoings" and they were slightly less pissed, considering they had banned me from going to even band camp two minutes before. so it was allll goood.......  oh right, so now i can't talk to eleanor on the phone, and that sucks. i'm too lazy to walk over to her house, plus ive barely been home. she didn't come to UH today because she was babysitting, and omg she left a bunch of cards in my locker and i didn't get to get them because the school had been locked down by the time i got out of band practice. i went there this morning, but it was closed. WTF! i thought bellaire opened ealry and closed late....well, w/e. rach was sort of really pissed off, because i had printe dout a really nice table of contents and stuff, and like 100 pgs of blank papers with the "BEllaire NEG....Coral Reefs...Team HZ....(  /  )" header on them....he picke dup the stack, looked really happy, then flipped thru the blank pages and five minutes later we had a meetings where three things happened, all with him basically disgruntled. at least rach is nice when he's being serious. bu ti feel bad cuz the rest of them were sort of pissed at him. he laid down these "rules for bellaire debate" earlier....and they were basically rules that josh and justin and avinash would like, but since the rest of us weren't brought up that way (haha "rbought up") we thought they were a bit unreasonable.  1) no K's.  (ok, i  can deal with that. :-D) 2) only one T a round, and only when it is the only argument. (8 minutes of T, WHAT?) 3) no discoursive wins. (meaning no generics, and no theory debates......i hate theory, but i will miss my generics...*sniff*)  so anyway, we went over what affs the other schools were running, what was the progress of research assignmetns (man he is pissed off.....), and what the partners for the team will be.  ugh....man. i feel so horrible because nobody was really taking it seriously....they took his list of rules and sort of played around with it....jon earl the ass did.......and omg.....nobody is turning in their assignments. i know i can't talk but at least i show up to meetings and am working on it...........dude, this year is going to suck....and the only thing that is going to make it kewl are the people.........i love debating with eleanor, and the ppl in debate are mostly just kewl. ps, matt and muthu didm't get kicked outa debate. they just got ehir evidence burned up. :-/  plus i love seeing those ppl on the circuit like shane and nick, kirby and kirti, summer, and all the old favorites........  what's with the shunning of davids? nobody wants to debate with reinitz, and nobody wants to talk to heaton....geez....and i both think they are AWESOME people. hmm......  ugh...the tyranny continues. i finally got "dazed and confused" downloaded, and i was playing it, and my dad is all "turn that off, it's horrible". begeezus. rolls eyes up the schizza....and this morning we had the usual radio wars, with him disagreeing over freaking BIG YELLOW TAXI!!! dude, i was listening to 96.5 which i thought would apease his weird conservative music tastes but no........i ended up lsitening to my cd player on headphones. my eyes are falling out of my head from the rolling!!!!  i dunno...they are just not being cool at all. ugh.....i can't wait till school starts again, when i can confine myself to my room (oh right, i need to clean it) with my books and music and tv and bed and just work like an idiot, come out only to eat and use the bathroom, or otherwise be at a debate, band, AC, or friends function. AHHHH......i'm about to bust.........  ok, i think the school spirit has started. i wonder if this is what josh means by getting burned out...? nah.....oh well. i think the worst is yet to come, but at least i'm good about getting up in the mornings now. haha..i now it's like wait until u start puling all nighters an then trying to power nap again. no pills this year, i promise. no cheating either. :-D  man this really sucks. i'm sort of stuck in a dead end. no world history book, no debate files....no homework that i feel like doing. can't even practice clarinet cuz my parents dont let me at night. (more tyranny, but that i dont mind so much).  we had fish for dinner tonight.  why am i the debate bitch?  jane

      sorry about those previous pointless blogs. i was bored and lazy. hehe  oh man... you've got to see the PTO's "newsletter" (there's a box dedicated to the ac team)!!! it is beyond hilarious... and worse (but more informative... it prolly gets better circulation too) than the zoo crew newsletter. at least the articles didn't end mid sentence in ours (they only bothered to continue one of those articles >.  i tried to re-read chp. 7 today... but wanted to fall asleep by 7.6. hehe maybe the essay will have to wait.  so... is there a UH thing today or not? cuz i called you at 1ish and your mom's like "shesa not home" i wonder where you are... haha you  have  gotten desparate trying to sell the TPP (outgoing name on outlook? hehe very slick...)!!!   but OMG get this: ms. resnick retired!!! and now ms. raby is the IB lady! gah... kill me now. x_X no wonder liang was having so much trouble w/ the dropping cultures thing... i mean... raby's the person who wouldn't let you into philosophy last year.  retainers suck monkey! they make my teeth sore and now i have to chew w/ my incisors cuz they have rendered the molars useless (unless i have some sort of local anesthetic... and we all know how that ain't happenin). GAH!!!  this blog NEEDS you jane!

      w00t! i finished chapter 4! finally!!! :) great... tomorrow i got the "short essay" haha watch it turn out to be 5 pgs... or longer! i need to stop being so verbose... arg. hehe remember those science journals we had in 7th grade for ms. beam and how she made fun of us cuz of how long the entries would be?  every year i get into the "almost beginning of school" mood and go crazy over office supplies. so yesterday... my dad got me two backpacks,  named  them after two colleges, and told me to decide which one i wanted to keep. he is so psycho... no wonder no one understands what i say... hehe i now have... 4! yes, count them,  4  locking binders! ahahahaha i can rule the world w/ them... or not. but hey, at least when you drop them all the stuff doesn't come crashing out... and bc of all the "incidents" i go through... that, my dears, is something quite significant. i also have dividers that i could go crazy on... like i did for 8th grade... but too bad i can't go too crazy cuz the colored ink is out. bleh  i prepared for card. camp today! no comments please... hehe. now if only i could get some of that superglue... my plan would be complete! ahahaha... yes... i need a strong/durable adhesive for those magnets that don't obey simple glue!  it's kinda sad how almost nothing excites me as much as the beginning of a new school year... but i can live with it... i love it!!!  ps. josh, if you are reading this and still haven't gotten the ultimatum from jane in the form of a cell phone message, call her when she comes back from band camp (finishes at 9)!!!!

      dude, you HAVE to blog. i know u left the blog to me or a few days, but THIS is just ridiculous. (hey eleanor...*wink wink*) dude....i'm writing too much. but i MUST!!!! lol.   tales from the doctor.....  she thinks i'm crazy. during the "emotional health" exam (where they ask u Q's about friends, school, activities, etc), she prolly thought i was crazy. like, during the activits part, i was telling her all the crap i do, and then i'm like "THAT'S the stuff that keeps me from sleeping" (cuz we already established earlier that i dont eat or sleep enough).  and she gives me this look, and says "and keeps you from doing drugs, and from having sex, and from smoking, and from drinking." lol she is so awesome, her own daughter just turned 18 and i was all bored in the corner so she got me an entertainment weekly to read. i didn't even have to lie down on that weird table thing. oh right, so then she's like "is anything going on with you, emotionally?" and i joke "i think i'm schizophrenic" and then she is grilling me with Q's just to make sure i'm not really crazy. then she asks me how my friends are, and if i have a boyfriend. i sort of danced around that Q, cuz my mom was there, and it resulted in her talking to my mom about how i'm ok, and it's understandable that i do all i do, that my temperment is something that is normal (cuz we fight a lot. well did. man today was awesome.......shopping, doctor's, afternoon snack at James Coney Island, more shopping lol. wow, and she only made 1 scene in the middle of JCPenney). and then she says that maybe my problem is that i'm too well adjusted. she has no idea how i have any time to do anything, and make the grades i do, and have a social life which i apparently do. HAHAH. she thinks i'm crazy. jeez i love that woman.  obviously, i did more shopping. total exploits for today: only like $60. man, i love cheap asian shopping. but of course, the scene made by my mom in the middle of JC Penney was of course, over the lowness of the jeans i wanted to get, and the little "white patches" on the thighs and ass. she thinks they are too grungy, so i went solid. oh well, s' all good.  note to self: get a lyre and flip folder on sunday.  ZC party tomorrow!!! sWEET.

      ok, now everything is not so funny.  after a rather sobering convo with yue last night (man, it was LONG too...i was just meaning to kill time before ER started and then by the time i got off it'd been over for like half an hour. so apparently my parents are both very screwed up asian people, and i am merely the screwed up product of these two people. oh dont worry, it wasn't like a fight where she was saying i was screwed up.  actually, she was trying to read me for clues to zuhair's secret, and i was trying hard not to emit any. i forgot how, but the convo somehow turned to how detached my dad acts. i never thought about any of that before, i always thought my mom was the screwed up one. as in, she's childish and narrow-minded and literally drunk with the power of american parenthood. but then again, that's classic asian. (refer to the Joy Luck Club heeheehee.....i think she reminds me most of jing-mei's mind. CPC summed up in one sentence: "I'm not asking you to be perfect.  I'm asking you to try harder, reach full potential.  When you reach full potential, you will be best!" (not exactly how the line went but yah we get it)  Now my dad i thought was a pretty normal person. he doesn't rant or yell (much...and when he does it's for such stupid things), and he's very logical and reasonable about everything. but apparently, he's really detached. it's always like he's got his mind on something else.....when yue got out of the car yesterday, he said "bye" like it was a surprise she was in the car at all. and come to think of it......he's always like that. he's oblivious. i used to think it was a good thing, because i could get away with so much, and lie my ass off badly and still get away with it. i could sit in the back of the car with eleanor and talk about having sex with josh (i'm not) and he wouldn't notice. maybe that's why my mom suspects, and my dad is like "trust her."  and it seems like it's rubbing off on me. see, here it is. observing the whole situation with no emotion, merely reporting facts. begeezus. no wonder people are saying i sound sarcastic all the time, even when i think i mean it. come to think of it....when was the last time i really felt anything at all? i'm always justifying, rationalizing, planning things in my head. maybe that's what my dad is doing. he doesn't get out much. he eats, sleeps, works, reads, watches TV. when i ask him to, he comse with me to one of my functions. i think my mom has stopped trying to take him on her joyrides.   i thought about it last night (after writing about it for 45 minutes. sorry, but i'm always a writer. documentation necessary.....) and then i started getting a little sad. like...i think i was REALLY sad. i cried a little bit, about how i really am wandering around aimlessly like i always afraid to. i planned so hard to make sure i knew where i was going: to soccer mom bliss, or at least to optimism. this isn't optimism. it's denial and detachment.....and i realized it for a moment, and i cried. just a little bit, because when i wiped away the first tear i think something in me snapped and i suddenly wasn't sad anymore. i was back to that "no, it's alright. this isn't that bad" mindset. i stopped crying too, if u can call one tear and the beginning of one tear crying.   so i laid in bed and thought some more. so, if i've got no emotion, how did this happen? was i trying so hard to deal with my mom that i turned into my dad? how come nobody can see this except for yue. maybe not even eleanor, maybe not even josh. do the caffeine high's and ability to talk to myself for hours make me a happy person? a person who can deal with things?   or......is this really alright, and nothing is wrong. i'm just pretending? well still. what bothers me is.....why dont i feel? very little makes me feel anymore. the last time i cried for real was prolly when i thought eleanor committed suicide (there ya go, rationality gone).  but normally it's all just.....well, not an act. an act that's become real. too much stuff going on. but at least it works. people around me are happy, and i am always satisfied.  maybe i'm overanalyzing this once again. this is why yue told me not to write anything down.  oh, but i have decided something: i'm going catholic.  ******************************************************************************************************************************* ok, total change of mood. ooh....so my ass hurts like a mother, and i can imagine why. too much walking yesterday....too much sitting as well. hahahaha. but i had to get up early today because i wanted to go shopping with my dad. man.....stores in the morning are the schizz! u know...when everything is all neat, there's not too many people there to deal with.....all the sizes are there, and there are multiple smalls!!!! well, mostly anyway. it was pretty nice...man i really didn't want to go with my mom because she gets so nickpicky about everything, and of course my detached dad merely thinks for a few seconds and then nods approval. haha, it was pretty funny though. my logical self floated out of my body again and was looking at the situation. here it was.......a really weird asian chick and her equally ewird dad. the girl, trying to live in the moment by going nuts in the juniors department, and her dad just wanderin behind her carrying everything she was going to get and looking distracted like a stoned scientist. i wonder if my dad is doing drugs. prolly ADD. yah, he denies it but so do most non-clinical doctors.  so anyway, i've satisfied myself for the moment. remember how last year was the year of the short sleeved blue shirt? well, this year i'm going school spirity. everything i bought was either red or white!!! yah, that means no jean jacket or shirt that looks just like my other one, but i can't remeber why i ever wanted it. i visited that awsome pantsuit that we saw the othr week.....*sniff sniff* i felt empty w/o it, but then i rationalized to myself "dont be silly, u have another one already. besides, who debates in a pantsuit besides jessica huyn?" lol. but yah....ok before the year is over i am still going to get it. haha, just to indulge myself and maybe beconme human for a second.  so when we finished wandering around JCPenney, i was like "dammit, now we have to go to old navy." and he's all, "why?". i respond "because i need to get track pants for band." and then he gives me this detached look tat's like "ok.....then. but go with your mom, i have to go to work now. (it being like 10.30) "  so then i fretted over shopping with my mom, but i think it'll be alright because she went nuts and decided that not only were my purchases satisfactory, not too revealing or otherwise "bu shan yan", she wants to go shopping too so i figures it'll be a joint shopping trip and i can just run away and hide when we get there and not show up again until i want her to check out for me. haha....man i am a horrible daughter. oh wells.  varun and ingrid didn't want to shoot me. *whew* zach things i was there only because they never told him i wasn't, and i guess he figured i just didn't want to have lunch with him or something..........  PLANS FOR TODAY (not blogging about them unless something happens out of the ordinary)  - lunch at 11....it's a friday and i'm home so i'll be watching my soaps. - doctor's appointment at 2. i am going to try and get my mom not to come in with me because u know when dr cutler asks me all those annoying questions and vice versa my mom will interject unnecessary comments....such as "she doesn't sleep enough, she doesn't eat enough.....she's living ahorrible life!" . ok fine, u guys might agree wth that, but lol it's just annoying coming from my mom. we realized last night it's cuz i dont think she's got any right to say those things.....her being just as childish and unparentlike. now coming frm yue and eleanor....that's kewl. maybe that's why i can't get mad at them? - whenever i get back fromt he doctors,  i need to go to bellairea and take care of all that shit.   lovely lovely............  i still haven't worked any on world history or debate. dude this sucks. i still havent mentioned goingt o UH this saturday to my dad either. psh...he'll be fine with it.  jane

      the axe fell today.  basically it came down to two issues:  1) he doesn't trust me cuz of  that . and he still can't get over it. "obviously it was a mistake to get back together."  2) we've still got diff issues on love. he thinks mine is too utopian, i think even if he doenst agree he should let be perm the counterplan (debate-speaking). as in, he should let me pursue what i want.  i thought it was fine today. guess not. and to think, this all started when i told i wanted to withhold. then i said it was because i didn't feel the same as i used to. then he was like, why did we get back together......and then it led on from there.  my favorite phrase (i feel like a mahayana buddhist):  "i know what i want and where i'm going. i want to know if you're coming along for hte ride, because i'd like you to."  cold? who knows.  goodbye josh. i hope you have a nice life.  and i hope you learn to accept this.  somethings like love, hope, and happiness can't be settled for.  They're untangible, unviolable, unchangeable, and will always exist in utopia.  we just have to go there.

      the rundown on bishop:  basically, sucked like a mother. we were all a little condescending to the locals, but that was deserved. they were rather snooty to us as well. might i quote them....[come up to us] "hey, do y'all speak asian?" and then the tournament director goes "well you ARE bellaire" with one of those looks.  ok....  hotels: some smelled better and were less infested than others. alli gotta say is, with crickets, mosquitoes, bad AC, cigarette smoke, no soap, and brown water, that the wonderful invention of internet kept us all alive.  man....AOL IS SLOW!!! i know my normal internet is slow too but that was just ridiculous....seriously.  the rides: me and eleanor and ingrid and danila got to ride with rach half of the way there...that was kewl cept he was about to kill us all byy cutting cardds while driving. also, the stress level was through the roof since he made us cut updates along with him. oh well. i played music, and hte odd thing is every song i played that WAS the beatles, he said it a) sucked and b) was our crazy "ghetto music". everything that was awesome and WASNT the beatles, he said "man...i dig the beatles. right on!" crazy stuff  on the way back.....it was crazy. eleanor opted out, so it was me and ingrid and henry and daniel. i'm sure everyone got there way earlier, so we were going nutsw cuz the mosquitoes came out by the swarms later in the evening, and then we all sort of fell alseep and rach was about to to so we stopped at some gas station while he was outside smoking and talking and stomping around. the two towers had just finished though......  omg but before i fell asleep and when the movie ahd just started, it was AWESOME cuz apparemntly rach is this huge lotr nut. he started talking about it with me, and apparently he's read the silmarillion and were were talking about stuff...ok so the bhs debate squad is now "the dunedain". :-D because are more pure than all those other crazy folks in middle earth.  right...so the actual tourney.  the competition was horrible. they were all of noice quality. not eveno f houston novice quality, probably of like, well,....BISHIO novice quality. sadly though, the judging was even worse than the competition, so many of us got screwed over, like my lovely twin here.  so me and eleanor broke 1st seed, then julia and kim broke 3rd, and something soemthing soemthing....  anyway, so here's how it goes down: we all get shafted in quarters one way or another (illegit judging for me and eleanor - he voted on ballasting of all things, rach's horrible 1nc strat for julia and kim, and supposedly honest debate for elaine and rosa - i dunno, they are too kewl and modest).  rach and i both wanna stab mr m verdeber. i couldn't find him for hte rest of hte night, despite my wonderful purple equalizers wanting to. henry and daniel got equally as shafted against harlingen south in finals. ugh......they are NUUTS....  oh well.  what a wasted weekend. if we had all qualed, it would have been worth it. the no food, no sleep, many insect bites, all that......oh well. at least henry and daniel qualed.  and i am going to die finishing all my hw tonite. yue said she stayed up till 4 last nite. GREAT. steven says he's doing the chart tho, so i guess it's alright. *whew* great guy, that steven forrester is.  had a fight with josh. so here's how it is....i was talking to eleanor late at night about it, and all she said was "are you sure ur happy" and i sort of carried it on fromt here.  he never calls. he tells me to call him. i decide to stop calling to see if he calls. he doesn't. i barely see him at school, and when i do it's almost pointless. he says that if all i want is the "attention" then i've got serious issues. he says, if that's really it he can understand why i cheated on him. i'm thinking.....why should i be doing this if i'm not getting the attention i need? it's a relationship.....i think it should be a given. no mattter how selfish it sounds, it's work that way too. :-/

      oh, stop with the defensiveness [jane here]......begeezus.  how am i fake in the least? besides that whole nonchalant cheery facade of course but that's so fake it's  gotta  be real.  woohoo!!!!!!! bishop!  also.....since matt is making SUCH a big deal about it on his xanga and to my friends, i shall reply.  1) i never blocked him. he's got some bigass head if he thinks i'd take the time to do that for him, since i dont usually block ppl over somethinga s petty as that. i just got off 2) he DESERVES what he gets. it's bad enough he said all that shit about me and eleanor breaking at kingwood, and it's bad enough that he wont own up to it. what's REALLY bad is his trying to garner pity for himself over my natural reaction. it's not getting better until he listens to get a life/ chill out. not our fault nobody else broke.....   anyway, yah so debate is GREAT. lol...me and eleanor wanted to drop out of bishop but apparently stubbs and rach think this is "too great of an opporutnity for us" to let us drop. we changed our minds anyway, but boy it sure rocks to be loved by your  coaches . what a change from last year.  i love the blowoff first period too.

       issues/non-issues    classes   classes are....working out amazingly. man i'm so glad i quit band.....i miss the band lifestyle (i know it's like WHAT!!!!) but seriously.....i think i'm a fan of communism. something i was wondering about before.....signs of my communism  1) i like howeard dean, who is so liberal he's a socialist 2) i suck it up for the community...  man wasn't confucianism bound to breed communism? lol. yah but classes are fine. i get sleep cuz i do world hsitory in french (poor mr sam....i need to stop abusing the power. i eat, sleep and work on anything but french in there.) ditto for english.....  but yah, world histry is great..i actually LIKE putting the effort in for that...just not at home, not in that environment, not iwth my parents breathing donw my neck.   chem i could live w/o. but oh well...i'll get thru it, take the AP, and never have to take it again.....  rags, mr allen MEANT it when he said i should take AP. besides, there's two levels w/i AP anyway. dont laugh............i like blind hope. :-D   school biz   in a nutshell, all my clubs. debate is going great. i was gonna run for secretary but naeem is running bc he doesnt wanna run for prez bc justin is. i think tha'ts twisted. if justin doesn't prove himself a little more son i might do a write in vote for naeem. but he's being better.....peanut soup. :-D  hari and reinitz....the craziest of love stories....haha i had my input on that. i swear, ms jones was right, witch hunts are AWESOME for confessing sins. i totally let hari know how much i dont like him, but i phrased it constructively at least. (as in, gET OVER IT!!!!)  when the hell is the psychology club going to have a meeting? hurry up amy!  TPP....haha what can i say. im not failing as badly as i thought i was, but i need to print out more surveys.    people   haha...my that was a funny week last week with josh. the whole threatning to break up thing....that thing with chris....haha and then the brutal honesty. man you were being COLD!!!!! but it's cool it worked out...seee venting is GOOOD!!!! :-D that was unexpected.  what's the deal with matt and hari and them? geez......thanks hari. watch the round, and then cry over spilled milk. i dont fucking CARE ok? i dont care.  matt....mellow out seriously. ur less mellow than josh is with stubbs, and that's something. GET OVER IT!!!!! (everybody download the song by ok go)  everybody needs to stop being unmellow and detached basically. i never talk to anyone anymore. stop working people geez....stop attaching yourself to one person.....stop trying to go through with all these damn rituals.  you guys know what i'm talking about.  it's all so fake. and so worthless.   jane  ps i'm not as depressed as i sound, really. :-D yay, breaking kingwood! suck on that big 5!

       SCHOOL ISSUES   yar, so after a month and someodd days, it be like this:  mr. moore's guitar class ROCKS! literally and figuratively. hehe he would be showing us an example of a song using some chord we're learning and he'd bust out singing and all. the only thing i don't like is this business of how practicing guitar produces callouses on the tips of my fingers... i wonder why i didn't notice this after 4 yrs of violin... it's prolly b/c i never practiced... *ahem* yea... but the extra time in the morning to finish my hw is a neccesity (oh what will i ever do w/o a blow off 1st period? ahh!!! actually completing stuff the night before? no... you cannot be serious)  mr. wolf... huh... he's an interesting man. he does that whole smirk thing that rach and xi have perfected... it's vecing sometimes... (you know, i have to read people? hehehe remember that time over the phone? that was fun...) i think he was a dog in his previous life or something... the way he talked about the edible projects... hmm  ARG!!!! chem... johnsen is NICE and all, and i THINK she likes/tolerates me, but gah!!! it's weird how i love the labs but hate the writeups... hehe. and man... not doing so great on those tests/quizzes... not at all. [note to self: read the BOOK!!!!] i hope it gets better.... *crosses fingers*  chinese... mostly ms. tsai telling us some random story about taiwan and the weird chinese people and their customs. sometimes she'll get all sentimental about one of her cultures students who killed himself... and this girl will make this loud exclamatory/suprised sound like "ah?!?!?!" but the rest of the time is spent avoiding alex and daniel's persistent q's about chem. and on oral days i have to tutor david. i cannot believe how much stuff they've forgotten during the summer. it's amazing how much they [don't] know. jane, get cracking on that book i gave you today. time's not waiting for you!  ahh... lunch. it's ironic how i don't actually EAT during lunch anymore, much less talk to anyone besides rags or jane (and to her, barely) it's mostly spent in the debate room reviewing w.hist or elsewhere doing chem or finished hw in the library or something. i want my 2nd meal!!! oh well, there's always 8th period to eat it.  cultures w/ prakash: ahh... he's a funny/strange guy. he constantly refers to nudity and things of that nature. he says "i'm not perverted. i'm much too old for that." and smiles at us. his lectures deviate like mad, though, even when he's trying to finished something, like today, he'll end up "bringing some life into the class" by telling one of his stories and then leaving the lecture unfinished. but OMG! you have to watch that movie, devdas. i'll admit, its ending is craptacular, but the way it gets to the ending is beyond schizzy! i'll prolly get a pirated version for $5 in a couple of weeks [for educational purposes ;)].  w.hist: well, what can i say? i know almost every person in this class. all the schizzy and the not so schizzy people are here, and david li is #1 w/ a 100. bah... and oh yeah, in class essay tomorrow that i still need to read for (kinda didn't do the hw as was assigned... hehe) but the whole system of relying on emails to tell people things... what's the point when you aren't allowed to check email?!?!?  alg2: murray is nice... as long as i don't listen to her explaining the hw, i can keep awake. otherwise, i resort to pushing my eyelids up to prevent from falling asleep. those hw checks are killing me... yet another class i need to be prepared for before the class begins. bah....  debate: rach has entirely too much confidence in his novices! i mean, expecting them to write a new case in their 2nd week?!?! what the deal? we're (some of us) smart yes, but not THAT smart. he's also letting some people go CCX at bishop w/o even telling them (i.e. alex and bo) i feel like he's teaching to the varsity ppl in the back of the room whenever he speaks to the class (but meena thinks he's only teaching us newbies) so i guess he isn't being very successful, whoever he's trying to teach. and oh those stories of his wicked past are beginning to haunt my dreams...  eck. 1NC T shell, here i come (blindly stabbing w/ a green pen!)  next up:  PEOPLE ISSUES

      geez....dont blog at ALL....haha. well i'm a freak, and i MUST blog because......  -musical interlude- cl wake me up inside...wake me up inside....call my name and bid my blood to run...blahblahblahblah....cl  so i've been brought to life (pun intended haha) and i feel GREAT. maybe that's why ihave both the inititative and energy to blog. well i gotta power blog since i also have the initiative to start my wrold history hw (prety late) and i have 7 minutes to say all that's on my mind.  i'm free...free from marching band!!! i feel horrible though because it's not even like i hated it so much i couldn't tear myself away from it. it was like....it was like jason or kyle or seomthing. something so horribly addictive, so horribly damanaging yet with some hidden benefits. *shakes head* i'm going to miss all those crazy ppl....no more midget toss with tom, no more whining about psychology at fball games with aaron, no more weird looks from jenny and grant and britni and katey....*sniff*  well if i decide to get good at either electric guitar, sax, trumpet, or bari(tone) then i'll join jazz band. haha i NEED jazz band.....i know i'm a wimp and i can't totally detach myself from it forever. but i'm sort of sad....i wanted to be in jazz with chris and phillip...oh well. it would have been too hard (here comes the rationalizing...) and i have too much going on this year. ok, ok, i know i'll have even MORE going on next year but i'll a) have a head start and b) at least it's not marching band with afterschool practices....damn, but i'm going to have to try OUT for jazz band so that REALLY REALLY sucks....oh well. gotta get down and dirty with clarinet....if i'm ever going to make region. :-/ so close in middle school (not really ;-p)  but anyhow, the counselors were surprisingly nice today about changing my schedule. actually, ms fields was absolutely GREAT. i barely spent 10 minutes talking to her all day, and all i had to do was get mr allen to sign it. maybe she is more sympathetic about dropping tuff stuff than adding it? sure seems that way. but for some reason ms raby was being a real bitch and she made me go to mr allen to get it verified, who merely told me to go wait for ms fields again. geez......  so i was flipping through college admissions books while waiting around int he office, and man clark looks SOOOOOOOO SCHIZZY!!!!! dude....it's the SCHIZZ!!! if it wasn't for my crazy need for stability, i'd go there. it doesn't have journalism though.....boston u looks slightly less schizzy, but it has both journalism majors and and geography minors so hooray! yue informed me in algebra that vassar has both AND is schizzy AND jackie o went there. it's an all girls school though.....when i get to college, im going to NEED guys. it'll be my new yoga. ;-p  man debate is starting toworry me. no aff case, no case files, no partner that i consistently talk to. this SUCKS. everything is so independent, and i think i'm starting to lose the little respect that me and eleanor gainedt his summer. DAMMIT. naeem is great though......"there are some good cards in your file, you just need to organize it a little better". sweet. justin is being stupid. rach is waaaaaaaay too overextended. i wish i could help. but the OC demands my attention. man i feel evil.  i think i' m going to start walking home more. haha watch me eventually take detours to borders for le cafe. oh well, it's a nice place to work, if i would just remember to bring all my hw (forgot chem and french today) and putting stuff of (did the minimum of world hsit all weekend even though i had beaucoup de temps libre).   fraeked out josh today. freaked out myself. man....i put out...ISSUES!!! (a really bad combination of journalism puns)  overtime by 2 minutes.......but i want to finish downloading "think twice" by eve 6. oh speaking of songs....this is gonna bug me plenty. grant played an AWESOME song today at lunch....for jazz band.....i dunno what it's called tthough and i can't remember any words so no special searches for me. i'm going to bug you all and hum it so u can tel me capisce? damn.......  *WHINE*TEAR*WAIL* i WANNA BE IN BAND AGIN!!!!!!  someone remind me to go to their concert and sign up for region.  ciao babes........  man ingrid had on a cute outfit today.

      haha.....well i was going to do tennis anyway next year, so instead of tennis, lax....  actually my plans have sort of skewed up the shiz.......  cleaning my room and replanning my schedule, i figured i'd suck it up in band until next year. then iw as talking to phillip, who said that i should do jazz band if i really wanted to get out of band but not of WE. now, see, this rings a bell because chris had been telling me the exact same thing.....and i dont know why the lightbulb suddenly went off.  so if i can play trumpet (or figure out how to..i will) and if mr allen isn't too mad to let me in jazz band this alte in the year, then all will be peachy keen because my parents A) want me to quit marching band and b) my mom says all bellaire bands EXCEPT jazz band suck. (she said this last year at our concert. rolls eyes)  maybe everything will work out...  but anyway i got up at 9 this morning (my little insomniac self kept having nightmares about mr allen and jazz band, eleanor, and detachment) so i got up and made myself some supposed-t-be schizzy apple pancakes. i was the only one who ate them of corse, but that's at least partly cuz a) i only had enough flour to make enuff for myself and b) they're asian. do they EAT pancakes?  i feel so detached.......friends are complaining (even the ones i thought i'd never lose....), parents are like a monotony of nagging/schizoness, and i'm just sitting here watching bad movies (was monty python and the holy grail always that stupid?) , and working whenever my mom starts insisting loudly.  maybe i oughta start spending lunch with my actual friends............  ugh. detachment SUCKS.

      ooh twins! whatever shall we wear? we gotta be AWESOME twins....we gotta stand out....let's do something funky with red and white....dammit you are GOING TO THE GAME WITH ME!!!  no way in hell am i going to a DRW and ortho appt that weekend, with no debate, just tos tay home and wonder why i'm wasting my high school life being a stuffy old dry AC member. *cough* will's going to the game. gosh, that guy is awesome.  anyhow's, i guess acadec isn't that great, but at this point i'd PREFER another english class. ok, ok. if u get onto AC, get me onto acadec ok?   when everything falls apart....nothing remains. it's a vaccum. that's why you gotta fill it up with fluff. maybe eventually it'll get dense enuff to be legit.  awesome song- "Hands Down" by Dashboard Confessionals  Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep This air is blessed, you share with me This night is wild, so calm and dull These hearts they race from self-control Your legs are smooth as they graze mine We're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst to break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  The words are hushed, let's not get busted, Just lay entwined here undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions.. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear, so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst To break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  Hands down, this is the best date I can ever remember I'll always remember the sound of the stereo,  The dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair That you twirled in your fingers And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late And this walk that we shared together The streets were wet and the gate was locked So I jumped it, and let you in And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist And you kissed me like you meant it And I knew that you meant it That you meant it, that you meant it And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it.

      jane: murray is giving extra credit for dressing up during spirit week. we can totally do the twins thing!  it's true... debate does corrupt ppl. i've known for how long now? but i think a major contributor to that is not debate itself, but the fact that the ppl who join debate are messied up to begin with.  AcaDec isn't that great. you just get to listen to ms. quiate read you poems and then ask you stuff that she thinks you should know. all the while i'm like "what???" there's no excitement... less competition... it's like another english class.  >.<

      a few details to accompany the mutual feelings of this other twin.  Friday: uneventful. went to the coaches lounge, eleanor came in about half an hour. cold for a few hours, and then i started visitng the tab room and judges' lounge a little more. oh right, jackson wu and some band ppl came by, but hte coaches got pissed off and stubbs came and told us not to let everyone in.  trey forced a reconciliation. thank GOD. poor eleanor, she's been going through a lot, just like the rest of us. yue's dad asked us where she was, i think she went to bennigan's. when did you fall???  Saturday: here is where the real story begins.  6:30 - i get up and go to AC. i feel cheery, and i wonder why the hell i'm getting up so early. it's a little chilly, and dark so i can't see the clouds yet. when i get to the circle drive, most of them are there and we leave fairly soon. i get in the car with andrew and i realize later that day that it's happening again. just like last year, the "A" team are all friends. they've got a clique. just like last year. but they're too arrogant to admit it now.  12:30 - well, we just lost 3 out of 4 rounds, two more of which we SHOULD have won. too close to tell, it was like a 5 point difference. dammit. and it was my fault too.   lunch rolls around. things are pretty bad anyway. larissa feels horrible, and josh is being....josh. he's not a bad guy. which makes it all the more worse when he talks to everyone around me. rice is having a booksale. i got "hamlet". how fitting.....oh, and i got coffee too. who knew subway made (really bad) coffee?  2:30 - hurrah, hurrah. it turns out we're hitting our own team now. yes yes....Bellaire B against hte formidable A. how unfair, how embarassing. how painful that we lost like 50 to 230. how embarassing that josh shook my hand three times in good sportsmanship, and how i secretly wanted them/him to lose in the two rounds they had after it.  6:30 - they're pretty good people. the scorekeeper mistakenly said they won, but ms brison and mr peek had a tie. they had a sudden death tiebreaker, and they lost to st. john's. go figure...that's what happened last year.  when we leave, i thought i had to go ride with josh but ms brison took me. i call meena and she says they'll wait for me to get back before they go to bennigan''s. eric, kelly, nick, and andrew and i go out to dinner. after some indecision, we go to los tios in meyerland. damn, they've got good enchiladas. i think the new tuna is refried beans.  8:30 - i get back to bellaire. wow, am i happy. after convincing nick to actually drop me off CLOSE to the multipurpose room, and i'm really happy. i let my hair down in the restroom right before we left los tios and i guess that sort of symbolically meant something.....i'm on this crazy hi.....sugar and caffeine and relief and regret all mixed into one.  i see yue, and eleanor, and rags and kim and julia and all the people......trey.....stubbs.....where is mr rach? i go to the debate room and there he is....you know what he says?  R: "Hey....there you are. you look different....." J: [points to hair] "i'm wearing my hair down." R: "Well, keep it up it looks great. you should do it more"  *sigh* and that's all i was looking for hte whole day. AC went horrible. it was raining the whole day. i got dirty, wet, stepped on, ignored, and i feel like for a good reason. dammit, i'm joining acadec.  10:30 - we all go to dinner. i'm high and drunk. we all go to bennigan's after judging LD finals. is it just me or is debate ruining all our friends? oh RIGHT. it IS.  bennigan's....yah. right before we left, rach looked so freaking tired. poor guy. he's so tired normally, this must've killed him. he needs a vacation. we all need a vacation.  11:30 - bennigan's. everone looks so happy, except for ingrid. meh, i  can deal with this. talking talking....drinking drinking....eating eating. laughing. smiling. ooh, let's make spirit sticks! i've got ballots.............  "rach, hang on ok? yue, hold hte phone "hey everyone!!! let's have a toast to a great BFT!" *cheers* "spriti sticks....  and it all falls apart. noone is happy anymore. avinash is being an especial bastard by staring me full in the face is saying "jane, this is STUPID. what the fuck are you trying to do? go SIT DOWN"  "shut up avinash."  me and yue go to the bathroom. linda comes in, i put on a smile and give her hte last spirit stick. jon u little fucker, i never thought u deserved one.  i come out. something is bothering kim. dammit, this is going so badly now.  12:30 - and everyone tries to go home....we have 2 cars: chang nad justin. xi and jon call their respective parents.  alessia is being demanding. julia is still being wonderful. meena...oh meena. naeem what hte hell has happened to you? this is too much. dont be so self destructive. i can't stay and watch.  chang..i know u can drive better than that. the roads are wet. we're out past curfew. goddamit dont make a u-turn here!  1:30 - i'm home. alessia and meena are home. safe. i'm worried about julia. she's still with them.  i'm home.....i'm taking a shower.....  i'm emailing rachnow. geez, i haven't talked to him in so long, he's like the only thing keeping debate alive (for me anyway). and now eleanor can't take it. poor girl. poor rach. poor everyone.  i'm telling him everything - how AC sucks, how debate sucks, how i was going to switch to ld, how everyone is being so evil after i was so happy.  DAMMIT.  --------------- and now it's today. i'm lonely, i'm procrastinating again. watching tv.   i miss josh. i miss the way debate used to be: with all the people....without hte stress. i want rach to be happy. he's a good guy.   and now i've got to work. i told myself i'd work when i got up. that was at 4. i told myself i'd work at 7. that was an hour and a half ago. and now i'll "work" when i'm done blogging.  i've got xi's tie. a comfort.  ~i'll have my facade on as long as i need it, because i'm not a genius~  jane

      everything is going horribly...  I used to like myself a lot more when I didn't talk to ppl about my problems. I guess by not stating them, I couldn't keep track of just how many there were. I wouldn't know what could be done... I'd never have to listen to another person's ideas. I wouldn't see how they dealt w/ things so much better than I do. But now that I know, and I know the things I must change, it's all the more disheartening b/c I know I won't/can't change. So there they are... laid out in front of me. And I can do nothing. I disgust myself... yet why do I keep mentioning the faults of others when I have so many more of my own?  w/e I've become... I hate it.

      all it took was 20 minutes.  here's a little allegory for you good kids at home. (preview of what's to come come IB essay)  meet facade. she's a pretty mellow chick. she knows how to have a good time, and what to say to make people love her.  but poor poor facade.....she smokes to much (just like a debate coach we know) and now she's got no more energy. she's having to work harder and harder, and there's no oxygen in her bloodstream to help out her myofibrils. so of course, she relaxes, and take another smoke. isn't hte entrenchment nice? but at least people love her. for now.  meet reality. he's gotta be the most asinine person you've ever met. he's one of those people that is cynical, sarcastic, and is always so very  painfully  right all the time.  every now and then he pulls through for you, but of course, a shaft is a shaft, and reality is....very close to that. but even though he stands alone, he's always standing in the end. and that's what gets him through.  talky time for jane. going to UH tomorrow...to research, but i'll prolly visit u peeps if u have to go back.  ciao babe  jane

      a few intersting things have happened to one of our heroines since the last time she blogged.  1) went to the movies yesterday. matchstick men really really sucked, and so did once upon a time in mexico (though i only saw about 5 min of it w/ enrique iglesias walking around the desert), but cold creek manor was AWESOME. though eleanor's arm almost got amputated.  very nice....got home nice and early too but i am still semi-grounded.  2) me and jenni tried waking eleanor up this morning.. HAHA  3) i got mad at my dad for forbidding me from going so i made him buy me 10 cans of tuna fish. yum..........  4) someone called while i was out. my mom says it was jason. i freaked out, and then she was like maybe i'm wrong, maybe it was something else. haha at first i thought she found my old debate roster where i wrote "i love jason" all over it. lol................i tried figuring out who it was. very unlikely that it actually was him, since he's still in SA for all i can tell. i dont think josh is that petty........maybe u guys are being gay and prank called me from the aprty.........i shall see.......

      hahaha rach is so hilarious!  today when we were in his truck driving to cyfair he was all like "imma name my children frodo, samwise, etc. and imma name my house rivendell"  then 50 cent comes on the radio and rach starts dancing in his seat.... w/ his hands totally off the wheel in the middle of a highway, mind you!   so we get there, and there's   another   balloting error. only this time it meant i actually did not break. grrrr. so this is how it came down: we went 2-1 w/ 169 speaker pts and so did the Crosby A team (the sisters) so they (those ppl who have no idea what they were doing in the balloting room) dropped our highest and lowest speak rounds and did something to the middle number and we ended up w/ 55.5 pts while they had 56. gah!!!! i was told later that even if we had tied in the middle number we would have broke. X_X  i ended up staying till 4:30 after watching alessia and ingrid's quarters round and prepping out all the novices while rach's maternal instincts told him to feed us some food. man... it's so sad how the last meal i ate at the time was dinner on thursday.  rags and i go to bellaire via ingrid's dad and rags leaves after a while. then i sit down on those red benches in the front of the school and had my backpack stolen by some basketball guy. so i run after him and take it back from him and this lady sees them and they start running. then their coach drives after them but i don't know that they were ever caught.  and that was my day.

      why is this turning into a personal blog? yue, you need to post dammit!!! lol....  well, not mucht o say except now i'm obsessed with mormons. my my, they are intersting. elder trent and elder white have been coming to my house for like a month now to bug my parents into converting, but i've actually never met them. so anyway, they came today to invite us to the big mormon shingdig that is happening this weekend. (something weird: aren't i not allowed in their church? or are they secluding us....haha they did allude to the separte rooms)  but they are hilarious. we were talking for a little bit, and they are really nice. oh, no doubt they're being patronizing and hierarchical while at it but they are pretty nice. elder white is from atlanta, and we had some fun talking about the deep south. elder trent is from idaho, and we had some fun taking about how its in the middle of nowhere.   they are pretty nice people, but i gotta say, they're persistent. they were like "so are you coming?" and i'm all like "i'll try to" and they smiled politely. actually, it was more of a rach-type smirk but it was kewl. lol..... i doubt i really am coming, but after looking up all the mormon stuff my interest is piqued. oh, of course i'd never convert they are just way too patronizing and separatist and weird and stuff.....but they are nice. their missionaries are very persistent, and their chinese is better than mine.  i think i'll write some AC Q's on mormonism. if elder trent and elder white come back, i plan to ask them what the deal is with polygamy.  they sure are nicer than jehovah's witnesses.

      geez...u sound depressed. and i promise i'm not just another dumb chick making an obvious statement. solution? fucking QUIT DEBATE. ok ok...maybe not that drastic. it's very unlike what debate has taught us. actually it's not, what with henry's fucking himself and stuff.  i've been saying that a lot. not to be weird, but since i did just get out of a car with eric and noah in it, here's a funny saying:  Procrastination is a lot like masturbating. It's great at first, until you realize you're fucking yourself.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  anyway......  so i just got back from an AC get-together that i'd been dreading. right? those of you who know "that jane" well enough, it was all like "oh GOSH....why the hell am i in this stupid organization...please acadec, come and save me from these people!"  and now i realize, it's just josh. no matter how immature this sounds and anti-helpful to the whole "let's reconcile by nationals" thing, i gotta say it. it really is just josh. HE's what we hate about AC. uptight, obsessed with the show, overreacting, whiny, and self-centered. i mean, i know they all hate debate, but COME ON.......eric's very cool about it.   so we went to fu's garden. i hate chinese food. i loaded up on iced tea and sugar. the real stuff. tim and larissa may succumb to the saccarhine (sp?!) of sweet n low, but no cancer for me. around the table, it was larissa, tiffany, nick, noah, eric, paul, (space to be filled with forrest - yes THAT forrest), (space to be filled with vinnie aka che), and tim.  the eating was pretty ..... fast. but before we met up, tim was there early, and then i came, and then eric and paul and larissa and tiff and w/e....but when they came...there was this weird thing with sexist handshaking. paul was a sport and gave me a hug. noah just HAD to be like that and shake tim's hand first.  paul drives like a maniac. 70 is not a good thing to do in houston. OMG....he lived on the outskirts of baltimore as well. reisterville or something. i'll look it up soon. just another thing to make the whole thing freaky. plays clarinet, took french, bday is june 6th. *shudder* but nice conversationalist.  so then we went bowling......i thought we ewre going to palace, but apparently there's a ghetto-ass bowling alley named dynasty lanes or something weird like that. next to celebration station....man it was all smoky, but they had this thing called "cosmic bowl" where they turned the lights off and put on colorful strobes and disco balls and played clubby music. i sucked at first, but i guess by the end i almost kicked andrews ass. granny bowls got me started, but soon it was just 1) gutter  and then 2) dead center for a spare, or almost a spare. if you get a neon colored pin in the center, and u get a strike, u get a free game ticket thingy. none for me of course. i played with larissa nad tiff, and tim and andrew. all of whoma re better than me. the rest of them palyed int he lane next to us, and thomas (looking like tom cruise in the last samurai with his hair) and angie came to say hi. the air was really smoky and stuff, and when i kept screaming stuff...yah so now i'm really tired, and my hair smells like mr rach.  man..i'm happy. screw debate. i'll work on it...but avinash really sucks, the rest of them are self-absorbed in a really messed up way (arguing about advs on aim? for no reason? sorry swaff, ur cool when u dont try), and the freshmen are just overly confident and obsessed.  oh yah, we saw mr johnson (yes, DJ) at fu's.  paul and noah (former debat.e...semi-buffs): hey, we just wanted to say hi DJ: well its a good thing you did.  [all leave]  heehee.  join AC. sure, all that you hate (exclusiveness, overly dry wit, etc etc) may exist in them but it's sure as hell better than debate. and really....it's not so bad. the old ppl are rather cool. class of '03 especially.  alright, gotta pull an all-nighter to finish world history and chem so i can go to the zoo tomorrow with eleanor so she doesn't freak when i tell her i HAVE to miss stratford. A team...wow. burning the midnight oil baybe. hooray for SAT 2's.  auxiliaries? yes, constructions are fun but let's not go overboard, especially too late at night.

      there are so few good people in the world. heh. it's a shame. don't worry jane... i'll only leave you occasionally.  I dunno about that sanity part, but as for wonderful and happy... I heard something as I was flipping through the channels on TV (I know, *gasp* friday night tv?!?! hey, i was sick!). there's this dude (he's supposed to be God or something. pshht) talking to this girl after somebody died.  girl: why does living have to hurt so much? guy: it is because you see the suffering of others. girl: so if i just became detached and didn't care, it wouldn't hurt? guy: *shrugs* you were programmed to become attached to people. ^ i think there was a point to that... can't think of it right now... but there IS a point!!!  yesterday i bought the finding nemo dvd (parents thought i'd grown backwards or something) and watched it. a movie i can laugh at... finally! it's got a interesting point too... maybe i should make my mom see it again and realize what it is: let your children live. how else would they learn anything? hehe  right. so i guess you're at the homecoming game now. bellaire losing as horribly as predicted?  YOU need some holiday spirit. come watch Elf with me sometime... or do something that'll get you away from home. why isn't your dad here?  damn those chinese parents. they never listen. it'll be a lot easier for THEM if they listened, too.  you'll pass... through fire no less... but you'll pass.

      what the hell happened to the world?? what has happened to EVERYONE???? where has all the sanity gone?  the only people who i thought would ever remain sane.....well, they're NOT anymore. who's sane? who's wonderful and happy? varun.  geez...well it's a friday night, i was enjoying it. i pulled out some old movies and i was watching it....and then miracle of all miracles, eleanor calls. and you know when that happens, you need to appreciate it cuz it doesn't happen much. then that stupid bitch (ie my mom) does that thing my dad does, cept she takes a leaf out of her own book to write the story on and she leaves the phone off hte hook and plays some crap really loud. THEN, when i go in there and unplug the phone in her room, she comes out here to PHYSICALLY wrest the phone away from me. shouting match ensues.   me: IT'S A FUCKING FRIDAY NIGHT!!!! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING mom: YOU NEED TO BE WORKING me: IT'S A FRIDAY NIGHT mom: WELL DO YOU WANT TO WORK ALL WEEKEND??? YOU'RE GOING OUT TOMORROW...YOU NEED TO WORK ALL THE TIME me: I DONT CARE...I'M TIRED, AND I'M GOING TO FUCKING DO WHAT I WANT  mom: DONT YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR FUTURE? I'M YOUR MOM, LISTEN TO ME me: I DONT FUCKING CARE mom: YOU'RE AN ADULT NOW, YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE me: IF I'M AN ADULT THEN LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE AND LET ME DO WHAT I WANT, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU mom: HAHAHAHA. WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT YOU STILL HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME me: NO I DONT. I DONT EVER LISTEN TO YOU, AND NEITHER DO I WANT TO. I'M NOT BOTHERING YOU. LEAVE ME ALONE, OR GIVE ME THE PHONE SO I CAN TALK IN MY ROOM [she's taken my phone away so i'm in the dining room] mom: FINE  * i get up to get the phone, slightly hesitating cuz i should have SEEEN what was coming next. eleanor, we're talking like old times, and my mom FUCKING HANGS UP THE PHONE*  well, my dad is out of town right now so this really really really really really sucks. god if he moves to birmingham i dont know what i'd do. HA. that makes two of us who can't go home beacuse of psycho mothers.  so now i'm playing music really loud (sure hope she hears it, its' filled with expletives) so that i can bther her. HA. i'm not irrational am i? i mean...geez if she just fucking gave me the phone instead of hanging up on my best friend that MIGHT have made a difference.  alright, things to do:  - take drivers ed so you really dont need her for anything - get a job so you freaking move out with eleanor  anyway, but i guess the other thing is that people are just being so freaking horrible.   xi was supposed to be rational. he's not. he's mad about something. everyone is. but nobody wants to talk about it, and when they DO, something or someone always takes it away from me.   my mom just came out here again and we had another shouting match.  mom: TURN THE MUSIC OFF me: FINE mom: DO YOU WANT YOUR KIDS TO BE LIKE THIS WHEN YOU GROW UP??? I'VE TAKEN CARE OF YOU SINCE YOU WERE LITTLE, AND ALL YOU AND YOUR DAD DO IS TREAT ME LIKE CRAP. DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE IS THAT IT? I'D BE A LOT HAPPIER WITHOUT YOU. YOU'RE A HORRIBLE DAUGHTER. me: HAHAHHA. MAYBE YOU'D BE A LOT HAPPIER IF YOU FUCKING CALMED DOWN. I'M FUCKING FINE, AND IF YOU CAN'T SEE THAT THEN YOU'RE A HORRIBLE MOTHER. IN FACT, YOU ARE. YOU JUST NEED TO FUCKING LEAVE, BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS YOU HERE, ESPECIALLY ME. AND I WOULD NEVER MAKE MY KIDS WORK ON A FRIDAY NIGHT. AT LEAST I'M MAINTAINING MY SANITY SO I DONT GO CRAZY LIKE YOU  harsh? maybe. but justified. actually, the only "reason" she's even still here is sort of because of me. she hates my dad. sure, i sort of disagree with him too, but she is horrible. my dad is a rational creature. i can work with it. but when she hates my friends, makes me work, and doesn't even care about my sanity...well. fuck that. i dont need it.  a couple months ago her and my dad had a fight and she threatened to leave (she was probably just throwing a hissy fit all the time. she keeps saying shit about hating me and wanting to leave and stuff, and it just makes me so sick now that i keep telling her to go. i'd be surprised if she actually went ahead with what she said and stopped whining so fucking much, but i can't say that i'd be sad. relieved even. at least my dad understands that friday nights belong to me)  and we've been through this SO MANY TIMES. geez.....we had a fight about this, about how she doesn't care, about how she's a fucking communist (for a lack of a better word), and after that long arduous night she finaly conceded that what i wanted was to "not work all the time" she actualy said she's try to let me too.  a week later, we're at it again, a nother week later.....  and it's all the same too. eleanor, debate, homework, tv, phone.   God, i know i should appreciate what i've got but this is just....a pestilence. SHE'S the trial i have to get through.   this is the hardest test i've ever taken, hands down. even beats PSAT writing.

      i was refering to a very old entry about his 'new philosophy'. mostly just cynical quotes, but you know how i like that stuff.  i was wondering where you went. wow. this is so seredipitous. you went to austin. and my parents' friends CAME from austin. haha. you prolly passed them on the way here and they splattered shit on your car. those ppl always say they can get here in 3 hrs, when it should take the legal driver about 4. i wonder which road they take.  it cannot be that hard to pretend to be a college student. look like you're serious about nothing but 'wordly' anyhow and that should about do it.  yea... i blogged. bored out the schizz and so tired of rach's constant UIL reminders. they make me feel bad. and danila wants to see how he would do w/ someone else. my debate career is great, huh?  oh yea. random Q: what's the furthest you've gone w/ josh?  why call rick????

      wow....i'm SOOOOO proud of you. you blogged!!!!  not much happened. i went to austin yesterday...i think my dad is seriously in a midlife crisis, he wanted to visit his old alma mater. the road from here to austin is really scary....ranches...good ranches...bad ranches.....scary ranches....cows....horses.........empty prairie. endless road. fast trucks passing you. we drove right into a cold front (byt hte time we came back that was also true) and so it was cld and rainy and i was fraeked out cuz the road was pretty narrow (rt 290) and ppl kept passig us and splashing shit on us. grrr......  but ut was fun. it's not a bad college...i guess i'd go there, despte my remonstrations of the past 3 years. my dad seems pretty excited about it. they have a kickass newspaper, but there sure are a lot of reprints. !!!! hmm......... the housing is weird. it's communism up the crap there. they ahve these co-ops...and they're all like DOWN WITH LANDLORDS! and stuf......scary. the rest of hte town is scary except for congress avenue i guess......it's impossible to find a mailbox or a residential neighborhood, but hte state capitol sure is pretty. the security guards are nice as well.  mcdonalds really does put beef extract in their oil for making fries.!  biodegradable packaging - en route to being finished.   oh, eleanor's out of town until sunday night. we've got a meeting on saturday morning. GREAT.   kumar, u better come back to debate...liang needs a partner.  jason's blog isn't all that interesting. what were YOU referring to?

      you complain about not having anything to do, yet here i come back, realizing you haven't blogged since Dec 19. SHAME SHAME!!!!!! in the words of a great liang "writing....man it's grea to be back, been writing for hours"  SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  in other news, i think i'm getting into economics. if i ever turn into an eco-hack, save me. or not, i need something to get into and i'm scared to touch the sciences.  oh, get this...  "If losing a friend means so little to her in the scheme of things, I know I was never really her friend anyway. Maybe she'll get it when she needs something. (xyzprincess, princetontigrrL, aJedimustnotLove - you know who you are)"  ^josh's profile. see, being on when nobody else is, u can't help but read random away  messages. he's pretty....indiscreet, and it's interesting how that applies to liek 50 different people.  "so i'm having breakfast now. didn't know it wias that big time. hmm...yeah, then i'm gonna go lift. adios."  ^rags's away message. man...SOMEONE's detached. *COUGH*  "Today's Corner: The Word of the Wise. I have noticed in you people's profiles stuff saying how life is harsh and unbearable. I understand perfeclty how you feel. I mean, I AM in similiar situations you people might be involved in. Now that my sympathetic side has had its say, here's my sophisticated and wise side. Tough. Live with it. You people make me puke complaining and being sick."  ^will's (c) profile. MAN YOU KICK ASS MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! though he's rather guilty of being a hypocrite in his former days. loved his penguin icon!   your turn. analyze this. :-)  "away: debate ------------------------------------- *fingers* - i'm the optimistic one sean mintz or anna harget: someone get me their #s or make them call me!  why does the public debt have to be soaring?? damn...my most ingenious DA ever...  haha...another metrorail accident.   pinot noir = yumm...."    ================================================  in other news, its been a straight week of doing stuff. i never that i wouldn't enjoy doing stuff. oh not that i havent enjoyed it......on friday me and my mom went out to lunch and shopping and got lost a million times and didn't finish lunch until 4.30 and didn't get home from shopping until like 9. the galleria's scary at night.   and then on saturday we went to kemah.......... and then on sunday....i got up late, finally did some debate, and then i was off to this cocktail party. or rather, i thought it was going to be a cocktail party. my dad's boss annually throws one, and since i'm in this "cosmo" mood, i got all dressed up for a cocktail party (black pants, dark top, and "smoky eyeshadow"   monday....did more debate, got up later........me and my mom went to meyerland. she doesn't like black on me. found cute skirt. mom thought was too short (of course). got white out. still need to get eleanor to watch meet joe black.  ok...but the weird stuff: my dream from last night.  It feels perfectly normal to have been in the debate room, say, two weeks from now discussing plans for colleyville. we're all back, and eleanor is off to somewhere when i ask "when do you want to watch meet joe black?" she says of course, the night of and on the way there, since it is in dallas. apparently, my idea of a debate sleep-ver (in the room) went over well, so for some reasons we're all there. scarily enough, i hooked up with danila for some reason (maybe cuz you wouldn't stop talking about him last night), and then there was this horrible accident.  outside, in the little placewith the dumpsters on hte way out to the teachers parking lot, something happened, though i'm not quite sure. but anyway, i went out, peeked for a bit, and when i saw the coaches alll lying down on the ground (rach, trey, donna) i felt like puking so i ran back inside while danila comforted me.   but then, rach suddenly knocks on the door of the computer room where me and danila are hiding out, and he's like "what are you doing in here?" with that smirky look he has, and then i'm sooo happy i start crying and hug rach cuz i thought he died. apparently bralee's ok, but rach tells the rest of us that trey is going to not make it through the night. the dream ends with my mom waking me up (i'm really sensitive during vivid dreams) by closing my wndow and taking her computer back (that i was using last night to cut cards), and in my dream seeing the paramedics take trey away.  *shudder* that sucks. trey is pretty kickass.!!!!  anyhows, i revised my plans for the file. all thsoe DAs....well, two more of them got turned into solvency turns and then i threw out 2 more. so that leaves 3 legit DA's and a page of economy turns to be linked to hte impacts later. :-) you think that's unfair, but i think it's SLICK. :-)  been struggling with economics all night. help from eric, paul, arthur and my mom's economics book. brain=jello. ciao.  jane  ps so freaky - my mom hung thesedecorations on our door, and now whenever it's windy or something they knock aganst the door and they sound like an intruder or something, or i keep thinking eleanor's at hte door.

      if ur talking about who i think you are, then no, it's not your problem. your only problem concerning that is that you're too attached to the status quo. i'm going to give you a little advice you gave me this summer : "end it! end it now before you go to hell!"  if you're talking about everyone else, then just....*relax*. wait until you see what i'm getting you for christmas. perfect inspiration, cept now i've got to drive out to the village and get it. no meyerland is going to have a decent present. haha....

      so  that's  why everything was being all weird. dude, did you change the formatting so it only showed one day at a time cuz uh.....that really sucked. haha. i changed it back to one month at a time. :-) *winks*  well i'll get to businezz since i haven't blogged and stuff's actually been happening.  stratford was weird. poor kim, she was sick a good way of the through and rach was being a little overly positive, he essentially forced her to go. handed her some drugs, and strongly urged her to debate. and kim's so sensitive, rach's opinion means hte world to her so she forced herself to go and she just started throwing up and well, let's say she only made it to one round anyway. (oh, but they were 2 speaks from breaking anyway. :-D). but rach needs to watch it, he called her immature and childish and it's bad enough already when kim believes him when he's sarcastic.  personally, t went well. there's a wendy's across the street! but i barely ate on saturday anyway cuz yes yes...finally broke and made it to a decent elim. finals to be exactl, but somebody decided to follow TFA rules and we're debating at a later date. was supposed to be yesterday so i think it's been postponed indefinitely. i wonder who's gonna get hte TFA points. it was those cy-falls guys too! fry/welch.....those idiots from crosby octos and 3 k's last year. grrrr. vegeance......  man it was so late too! wow but the best part was beating those idiot crosby girls. sorry, i knw rach likes them but they SCREAM SO LOUD in the round. even the judge was like....cool it. but there was this cool judge in octos that taught me how to pick u a T again in case the 1ar drops incase of time. hahahah.....go reasonability!  anyhows....yah so it was late and then rach took us all back to school, cuz muthu and jon made it to semis and they were still around.   we got home, and when my dad was taking everyone home, these HISD cops came over! omg iwas like WTF!!!!!!!!!! apparently we set off some alarms at school (uh...debate room????) when we were waiting and they came. my dad, the idiot didn't have his license and i guess they didn't want to arrest a parent at 2 am taking home a bunch of debaters so they said "does anyone have any id...??" and i gave them my tpp pass. hahahaha.  so then we took kim home, and the laughing was uncontrollable. EVERYTHING was funny. man.....she lives far! like...in a really nice neighborhood. up there.....tnaglewood. wherever that is. over there, it looks like (good, like central park area) new york! cept clean of course haha.  and then....ons unday night i was not doing work and then i felt quesy, so i went to sleep and then when i woke up int he middle of hte night i started throwing up...like a lot and really hard. i know, nice details but man it sucked. and this, being the middle of the night and immediate after waking up, i got all messed up and so did my bed and some stuff on the floor. haha i know...REALLY REALLY NICE DETAILS......but of course it got all cleaned up and then i spent hte night with my mom and wow i was freazing to death. then the next morning, i had a freaking high ass fever and i sepnt the next two days at home. datytime tv realy really sucks. i miss home improvement. they ruined ER. craig kilborn is nice. :-)  so then i didn't do ANYTHING....and when i got back to school thursday (yesteerday) i was all weak, and walking up thes tairs really reallys ucked for me. and carrying all those books, since i was behind, needed tutorials/makeup, AND it was finals and teachers were demanding it. at least i missed one of those chem quizzes.....heard it was a whamdinger.   but of course, i found out i was smoking crack during the chem test on molecular geometry and missed a few really easy ones...and yay i got a 73%. looking over, yoweii got a 52/60. of course. then they had a quiz, and i sort of had to glean info from them going over hte last test. i finally figured out an excessively elenghy method that worked, but i'd wasted a lot of time and it took so long anyway i only got two problems done.  then today i idn't have my chem book cuz i lent it to eleanora nd i brought my dad's old one, and man....yah oh well. it's not as good in the gas laws apparently. not that hte other one is good, but it's just not as chock full of info and of course the questions aren't as gay.  anyway, took the tpp final, and it went pretty well. my column was half-asses though. i got 484 words down, and that's hilarious when a standard column is like 600 or 800. i wrote about ppl who skip class to miss tests and stuff.  nothing much today. yes yes, i do realize we are all screwed in chem. but nobody as screwed as me. dude....we've got 1 bad test grade this six weeks, plus 3 worse quiz grades and a mediocre lab grade. woohoo. dammit. 3 days at home, and i didn't even use them well. especially the last day, man no excuse for that. well....with me and my solve all method of just plugging PV=nRT for every single prob i get, i oughta fail nice and good and shamefully earn a C semester average in chem of all things. dont talk. i'm doing worse than you are.   finally made up my DBQ. wow...that was weird. i bet i could ahve done better, especially on my lovely one sentence povs that bbarely made sense.  it took me like 20 minutes (seriously) just to figure out my categories cuz i didn't really get it at first, and then i kept thinking of new categories to stick in.....and the pov's just sucked. then there' was naeem's adivce to "write a pov for every document, use every docuement, and write pov's for ur additional documents too   back on kazaa. happy and mad. the darkness = yay! ("i believe in a thing called love....excellent). limp bizkit = ugh ("behind blue eyes" cover"). switchfoot...STILL UGH.  i'm such a weirdo. i'm writing another debate file. yah i have to, but some topics get me excited, and then some dont. i think the ones i like are hte ones i've debated on already. haha. like lfa/ballasting/whales/shipwrecks suck monkey, but cyanide/itqs=ivolunteered for that!  well ac peeps, be happy. i'm qualed. no more missing (as many) tournaments. haha. ugh.  back to studying. riiiiiite. i'm so screwed. i NEED tos tudy for like all my finals. and i dont think i'll have time.  - Jane

DONT BEGRUDGE ME OF THE ONLY HAPPINESS I WILL EVER HAVE RIGHT NOW. DONT MAKE ME SMASH YOUR HEAD IN WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER. ALL YOU HAVE TO FUCKING DO IS GIVE ME MY FUCKING BEACHES FILE.  let me reiterate that "my"  i lent it to you to write the file which you did not turn out. that you are using it now for your personal use is extremely wrong, and god help me, if i dont get that file by the time i get off hte bus from stratford, you are going to find yourself with no files at all.  and YES that is a threat.  i can't stop you from being gay in most aspects, but this is a separate matter. a private one.   i can sue for this you know.

      oh dont worry, you're not a guy. and you're not too sensitive. yo're just a very straight up guy. do i like shopping? haha not really. i just like looking nice...well rather, i like having people think i look nice. and you know where all that stuff comes from.......  anyhows, good luck working it out with rags. suuuuure, dont take my advice, but i'll be around to pick up the pieces or to boil the egg if u dont fall (shut up, i think i got a cold so i'm all out of it).  well, on to naeem's oratory. i hate the way david johnson makes them write oratories, but it's ok.  "American Beauty?"  I still remember when i watched the highly acclaimed movie "American Beauty."  I kept having one thought: i have never seen many people who take themselves so seriously.  Lester Burnham, played by Kevin Spacey, begins the movie speaking from the grave, about his middle-class life in the suburbs. He speaks of how his life isn't the life of a white picket fence, a little house, and a nuclear famly.  And it sure isn't! Lester is int he deepest pits of personal pain.  why wouldn't he be?  He quits his job, buys a 1970s muscle car, begins lifting weights, smoking pot, and develops an obsession with one of his daughter's classmates.  Lester is in a crisis because ordinary American life wasn't extraordinary enough.  The story of "American Beauty" is a story that tells us that things are seriously wrong.  Simple beauty masks serious sorrow.  We have six percent of the world's population and sixty percent of hte world's wealth, and yet we are seriously unhappy.  Unable to move forward in our lives because we are just plain too depressed to keep going.  And we flock to see movies because they are so seriously serious about the excessive seriousness of our lives.  But i wonder if we haven't missed the real beauty of America.  Why is it that studies by the United Nations reveal that around the world at this very moment one billion people are saving money to move to America? [Jane Says...: poor bastards] Do they want to come here so they can book passage on the Good Ship of Psychotic Misery? Why should people who have the many privileges we do spend so much time trying to believe that AMerican Life is the thing of harshest dramam rather than the obviously beautiful? [Jane says...: with wealth comes frills, with frills come fringes, with fringes come knots that are really hard to get out]  So why do people take themselves so seriously these days? Well, if you look around, you know it starts early in childhood.  Did i say childhood? Parents today treat their children as special adults.  No wonder, when we continue to have smaller families, then all our hopes are wrapped in fewer little bundles.  Each child is very important, very special, and very serious; they are one of a kind, god designed.  childhood.  things are far too serious for childhood. A child's life is set a birth.  Planning for adulthood transcends the great events of childhood.  Why play outside when you need to be studying vocabulary for the SAT? Why watch a movie, when you should be volunteering for good works to put on your own personal web page?  We are all going to end up in college [uh...really?], but in order to get into the "best college", we have to forgo childhood to prepare for that serious world of adulthood.  and children want to taken seriously; their nature is to seek attention.  They soon learn if they act like little adults they will be taken seriously, very seriously, and they learn earl to do something serious and blatant to get attention, and they will suggest that everywhere you look you see some of hte most seriously silly things possible.  A trip to any school reveals this.  Consider, the Goths.  No, i'm not talking about the barbarians that Burned Venice and i am not making fun of them because they are different.  I am making fun of them because they are silly.  Why do we have to take seriously a group of people whose only claim to fame is dark clothing,e ye shadow, hair and nail polish?  They are into being taken seriously.  they live for depression because they seriously think that their life as well as every else's is worthless.  They like dark and evil things such as death and the devil.  Isn't that serious enough for you?  And if they aren't taken seriously enough, they can listen to serious rock music about how depressing their lives are, pack up their guns, and some serious pipe bombs and head off to Columbine High School.  Yes - they can make you take them seriously; ask the friends of the ten students and the taecher that can really explain what it means to encounter people who only take thmselves seriously and are onyl attuned to themselves.  They block everyone out, and lay waste to anything that does not see them as the only show in town.  And we take these please for attention very seriously; in fact, we take everyone too seriously.  Most of us regard "political correctness" as a trite nation.  It isn't.  there is an ugly undercurrent to this thing called diversity - it forces us to seriously consider all ideas and all people.  We take every idea seriously.  Nobel laureate or nutcase - they are all seriously valuable.  no they aren't.  we don't have to take seriously ultra conservatives or racist groups.  but we dont have to take seriously today's celebrities either.  fame in Hollywood, and all of a sudden we have to listen to them? because thye are famous, they must be heard?  reagardless of what you think about George Bush, Madonna and the Dixie Chicks [I BEG TO DIFFER] make him look like a bright guy [has anyone read bushisms?].  At the Academy Awards, Micheal Moore won an oscar for best documentary, but he decided to use his speech to convey his anti-Bush feelings.  What drove him to use that forum? on something that has driven hollywood performers to use that soapbox for 50 years - inflated egos.  We will take them seriously. and sure enough Micheal Moore got a lot of media attention.  But when we create a society of where everyone is fighting for 15 minutes of fame, we end up believing we should listen to everyone whoever appeared in People magazine.  Listen as if they had soething important to say.  As we become so puffed up with our own self-importance, we drown in our own artificial seriousness.  our society becomes more lacking in common sense, more humorless. [rather, i think debate is to blame]  and we always do think about ourselves.  But we don't know that our personal dramas are not hte only dramas on a larget stage of life.  there are other people out there - and we seem to ignore where we really fit in.  we should be able to take a back seat sometimes, to listent o others and when we stop to smell the roses, let's not whine that those thorns hurt us worse than any thorns every hurt any really sensitive soul.  take a moment to look and laugh.  in our adult childhoods, put some childish humor back into the adult life that we artifically create.  i'll give you an example: tied in the serious serious exercise of all time - one New York Universty applicant put down 100 items he had supposedly done in his life, each more absurd than the one before.  He is the fastest sprinter in the world, but he didn't perspire, he baked and these rolls rose without yeast, world leaders sought him out, he skied in the Mojave desert, was the first to chart the human gnetic code - and after reading 10,000 applications that seriously told the same story of serious life choices - the admissions committee let him in.  And why not? He probably will be sought out by world leaders some day because he had some mental health.  Life cannot be all "mememe" our neds and this listen to me first mentality make a mockery of a society that depends on humane interaction with others.  our self-centered society has caused us to take ourselves too seriously, we sink into the dark theater of our self-imposed depressions.  and the road to perdition is the highway of own self-absorption.  the real "American Beauty" is a beautiful place [only if you make it....or others make it for you].  A billion people struggle to get here and the ones who are here are so acught up in their petty dramas, they miss the larger screen of life.  ----fin------  well, that sounded like that old psycho david johnson. whine hwine whine. GET OVER IT! you wanna tell me what the larger screen of life is? alright.  point is, there is no big picture. it was all a lie. it's about hte little things. get a garden. grow some weed. smoke it. then go grow some tomatoes and give them to me. :-D

      12 signs you guy is 'love' worthy [from MSN, hotmail was messing up, so clicked random schizz]. I like #12. ;)  1. You want to bring him home to meet your parents.  2. Things that usually drive you nuts or gross you out suddenly seem trivial. For example, if he's sitting there unabashedly picking his nose, and you don't want to break up with him right there, that's a pretty good sign you're in love.  3. He's a great friend.  4. There's a big grin on your face whenever you think or talk about him.  5. You can count on him. He's consistent, trustworthy and honest. He keeps promises and commitments.  6. He sticks around while you wait for the other shoe to drop. And while you stall, figuring this is too good to be true and are sure that he'll eventually mess up or turn into a troll, he just keeps getting better.  7. You're covered with hives, sitting in your Aveeno bath, and he asks you in all seriousness to marry him.  8. You've given up your "drama queen" crown. Since you know where you stand with him and are comfortable in the relationship, you don't need it anymore.  9. He makes the relationship a priority.  10. He doesn't run away if the two of you disagree. Rather, he'll be there to talk about it and work through it.  11. He holds your hand in public.  12. Your connection is so strong that you don't even have to ask yourself this question.

      oh... this is  freaky . jason hemann has the song that i used to love [and still like very much] on his blog:  Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an off hand way Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way  Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today And then one day you find ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun  - Pink Floyd, Time  - yue

I mean, Jane is my best friend and all, but what she says... well, let's just say it's not the best advice to take.  This better not be blind hope. I have a feeling it isn't. hey, if I have to be optimistic about something, what more worthy thing could it be?  - yue

      alright. i've got the timeline done. just need to photocopy it so that the paper's actually whole. [don't ask why i cut it. i was just being me.]  onto the actual meat of the project: the paper.  i can't write very well. not COT type essays, anyway. my dad told me to join tpp so i could practice my writing. maybe that will help, maybe it will hurt. but i'm not joining tpp, so i'll never know.  wow. haven't blogged here in a while. has xanga taken over the world, or what? dima even has one where he tells you to leave comments so he can know what we think of him. btw, what DO we think of him? he fits in... but where? i dunno.  i haven't talked to jane for 3 [going on 4] days. i think she's still sleeping. at 9 in the evening. yes, still sleeping.  model un wears you out, eh?  hehe

      I must say I have really gotten used to hating myself. And hitting myself... over and over.  Talked to a friend who got into a schizzy high school. A boarding school w/ some actual choice when it comes to the coursework. I wish I could go to that school. I wish I had kept ALL my friends from Michigan. Is there nothing I do which I don't happen to regret later? What a screwed up cycle I'm stuck in. Must get out...  Gawd there are ppl arguing and a dog barking like mad outside. They sound drunk.  Maybe that's where I need to be. Hallucinating. With my bottle of butter rum. mmm that sounds nice.  I swear there's going to be a shooting and a dead person here soon. I'm scared of the ppl outside. I'm scared of people. I bet they own guns.  Why are they so loud? Oh yea... the window is open. I wish they would realize that there is a person here so they could come and shoot me. Just for fun.  I'm not a sad person, oh no. Never make that mistake. The things that happen to me would not seem so major had it not been for my stupid head which concocts its own morbid ideas.  not that the ideas aren't logical. ppl just think they are stupid. they are clearly reasonable to me.

      was looking at random xangas and I saw this depressing bit [come on... no one is all of those things... or can they be??? hmmmm], so I jacked it! :  Wait for the boy who pursues you, the one who will make an *ordinary* moment seem magical, the kind of boy who brings out the best in you and makes you want to be a better person. Wait for the boy who will be your best friend, the person who will drop everything to be with you no matter what the circumstances. Wait for the boy who makes you smile like no other boy makes you smile, and when he smiles you know he needs you. Wait for the boy who wants to show you off to the world when you are in sweats and no makeup, but appreciates it when you get all dolled up for him. And most of all wait for the boy who will put you at the center of his universe because obviously he is at the center of yours.

      jane came today. i'm unsure of the time [i was distressed]. but she came, and that makes me happy. b/c dark chocolate cupcakes taste yum and she freaks out when i try to tickle her tummy... hahaha funny girl  i didn't get to talk to rags today, and that does not make me too happy. but i did send 2 emails *hint hint* somebody should check his inbox. hehe  i wonder what rags is doing now? i think he must be sleeping. it's 2.08 am. after i blog, i'll go read most likely. i feel like i've overslept yesternight.  hmm... jessica is waiting for someone to get online as well. but she went back to sleep. this i can tell from reading her profile.  when it is this late, i read everyone's profiles. but i check her profile first when i get on anyway...  b: bump that?     my mind is wandering away.... i must go chase it!  lates

      I guess I'll be making cake by myself today. and eating it too. too bad I don't have cake mix or the ability to bake the cake. also too bad how two other people were supposed to help me with that. they said they'd come. oh... they'd "try" to come. in this case "try" was not good enough. it rarely is.  I wonder what excuses I will hear from them?  they think it's ok to leave me by myself. alone. all the while my opinion of them decreases. you could say that they are good people... they are grand people... just not to me. it's ok for them to lie to me at times. it's ok for them to pretend to care. it's ok for them to use me. it's ok for them to avoid the truth and deal rather with illusions. they are happier that way. I've served them well.  Have I not?  surely, they have exploited me until I don't know who I talk about when I refer to "myself". but they gained some sense of fulfillment in the process. and w/o me... they still have lives of their own. which they would gladly turn to.  What am I left with?  empty spaces and a cold unfeeling heart.  I turned out well.   wow. I'm just like they are.

      I woke up today to my parents' attempts to wake me up as they were locked out of the house [how did that happen?] so my dad was ringing the doorbell [it's a novelty to him. he doesn't know how to ring it.] and my mom is calling the home phones [I gave her my cell for some reason o.O]. all the while, both of them are banging on the door. I was "asleep". so after... let's say... 15 minutes of that, they decide to use the mail chute [what is that thing called, anyhow?] to open the door like any average robber would.  all of which begs the questions: 1. if they could open the door through the mail thing, why didn't they do it earlier? 2. how is it that they have locked the door from the outside and yet don't have keys?  my parents are confusing people...  -_-

      I've recently been informed that some [unwelcome] persons may be privy to the thoughts on this blog. All the better for me, because now I know who my audience is. If you are one of the persons who shares the same last name [not to mention half of the same genes and a common roof] with one of my dearest friends, I have a thought for you! Yes, don't you feel special.  My thoughts: Do not think that you can take everything away so easily. You can try to take away his friends, his school, everything that matters to him, but he has memory and a resilient spirit. He will know when he is a father what his father did to him. It will stay with him and haunt him for the rest of his life, unless he becomes hardened to the world and feels nothing from this point forward. I do not think you want that. You cannot simply take his hope and happiness away and expect to subjugate him to your command. Do you seriously expect to brainwash your child just by sending him to another school? What if the same thing happens there? You are the single greatest influence on your son. He looks up to you as a model of what he aspires to be. Maybe he is losing that respect now, but you still continue to shape him. Think twice before you decide to scar him for life. Your rash choices will play themselves out and the consequences unfold... do not expect the very best at the end.  I will personally see to it that whatever wrongs done be redressed and everyone gets a fair share of what they deserve.

      I just read Rags's blog. All the way from last summer. It seems so careless that it sickens me. I guess that's just how it is when everything in the world goes your way. But then... boom comes the surprise that maybe this world wasn't made for him... and you can see the entries become a little darker.   He's still one of the chosen though.  I wonder who makes the choices? For the most part, the decisions are neither logical nor beneficial to those chosen.  Let's just hope his big head doesn't blow up any bigger. He's like Alessia, except not as verbal about how sure he is of his success. Meh. Both are sickening in many aspects. Not the least of which is that they are very difficult to talk to. It's like they are always condescending to you, even though they may make it a joke. But they know that they don't think it's a joke. It's not funny to them at all. If even the slightest thought of their greatness were shattered... if someone else so humiliated/defeated/vanquished them as to undermine their arrogance... I mean... God forbid.  It's not funny anymore. How you laugh AT me. Maybe that's why you can't talk to me. Maybe that's why I have to talk to you. You listen and don't contribute because you are assured that I am the lesser of the two.  You think you are better. Don't deny that.  Why don't you focus on yourself some more and figure that conundrum out? It would do you well.  But then, of course, it's a vicious cycle. Why would you, so esteemed and well-off as you are, listen to me, just one of the masses?  It's funny how people always think I'm wrong and continue to discredit everything I try to say. I think and have known from experience that it's their loss in the end, not mine.  Suffice it to say that I don't gain much either.  But that is the way for a lowly person such as I.  Rags: - never confronts problems directly, maybe he likes to think he has none - runs away whenever possible - does nothing in the way of prevention - thinks too highly of himself for his own good - blames others for all his problems - doesn't know what his problems are - doesn't listen when others try to help/inform him - makes light of serious situations for his own benefit - tricks and maneuvers into everyone's favor to advance his own agenda - likes to believe he is everyone's funny friend - also believes that everyone should want to be his friend - underestimates too many people - has a way with breaking promises [maybe he never meant to make them... who knows?] - has a way of hurting people and not realizing it - cannot think for himself b/c he is so tainted by his parents pressures - needs to stop obeying people who don't respect him or other people he cares about [this has been very slow in coming to his head... he says he was raised "well" and that's why he continues to listen] - needs to stop letting his parents live his life for him

      Thus we never see the true state of our condition, till it is illustrated to us by its contraries; nor know how to value what we enjoy, but by the want of it.   So little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason have we to depend cheerfully upon the great maker of the world, that he does not leave his creatures so absolutely distitute, but that in the worst circumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and sometimes are nearer their deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to their destruction. --------------  It's a very preachy book.

      I imagine a room with partially-read books littering the floors, the sunlight streaming in from the window, and walls. White walls which are covered in a kind of wallpaper. Walls lined from top to bottom, from left to right, in photographs and pictures of people I know and even some I've only heard of. A wall full of human faces, each with their individual story to tell.   I want to live in such a room.    I hope someday I will know each story.

      partially true words that I seem to want to make myself believe:  Everything is dead to me. I cannot comprehend the harshness of everything laid bare. Though my eyes are shrouded, the images imposed in my mind flash before me constantly, and I cannot feel their impact upon my spirit.  I cannot lead myself to the light. One must if one seeks to forsake all when one is compelled to by force. There is no guide but one's conscience...    there is much that I cannot bring myself to say, and so, will be left unspoken to those who do not wish them to be revealed.

      There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.  - Ecclesiastes 3:1-8

      Make me feel like a beggar Make me feel like a thief Make me feel like a battle, that cannot end in peace Make me feel like running, as if I've lost my nerve Make me feel like crying, tears I don't deserve  Please bleed So I know that you are real So I know that you can feel The damage that you've done Oh... who have I become? To myself I am numb, I am numb, I am numb...  Is this really living? Sometimes it's hard to tell Or is this just a kind of gentler hell? Turn out the lights And let me stare into your soul I was born and bled for you to hold  Please bleed So I know that you are real So I know that you can feel The damage that you've done Oh... who have I become? To myself I am numb, I am numb, I am numb...  Never said thank you Never said please Never gave reason to believe So as it stands I remain on my knees Good lovers make great enemies  Please bleed So I know that you are real So I know that you can feel The damage that you've done Oh... who have I become? To myself I am numb, I am numb, I am numb...

      And I don’t know where you went when you left me but Says here in the water you must be gone by now I can tell somehow  One hand on the trigger of the telephone Wonderin' when the call comes  Will you say it’s all right You got your heart right  Maybe I’ll sleep inside my coat and  Wait on your porch ‘til you come back home oh right I can’t find a flight We share the sadness Split screen sadness  Two wrongs make it all alright tonight Two wrongs make it all alright tonight Two wrongs make it all alright tonight Two wrongs make it all alright tonight  "All you need is love" is a lie 'cause  We had a love but we still said goodbye Now we’re tired battered fighters  And it stings when it nobody’s fault cause there's  Nothing to blame at the drop of a name, it’s only  The air you took And the breath you left  So maybe I’ll sleep inside my coat and Wait on your porch 'til you come back home oh right I can’t find a flight So I’ll check the weather wherever you are 'cause I  Wanna know if you can see the stars tonight It might be my only right  We share the sadness   Split screen sadness   We share the sadness   Split screen sadness    I called... because... I just... need to feel you on the line Don’t hang up this time And I know it was me who called it over but I still wish you'd fought me  ‘til your dying day Don’t let me get away  Cause I can’t wait to figure out what’s wrong with me So I can say 'this is the way that I used to be' There’s no substitute for time Oh for the sadness  Split screen sadness  We share the sadness

      Oh no here comes that sun again that means another day without you my friend And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself and it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else and it's so hard to do and so easy to say but sometimes sometimes you just have to walk away walk away With so many people to love in my life why do I worry about one But you put the happy in my ness you put the good times into my fun and it's so hard to do and so easy to say but sometimes sometimes you just have to walk away walk away and head for the door We've tried the goodbye so many days we walk in the same direction so that we could never stray they say if you love somebody than you have got to set them free but I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery They say time will make all this go away but it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays and once again that rising sun is dropping on down and once again you my friend are nowhere to be found and it's so hard to do and so easy to say but sometimes sometimes you just have to walk away walk away and head for the door you just walk away walk away

      I could have treated you better but you couldn't have treated me worse but it's he who laughs last is he who cries first  Sometimes I feel I know strangers better than I know my friends why must a beginning be the means to an end  The stones from my enemies these wounds will mend but I cannot survive the roses from my friends  When the last word has been spoken and we've beared witness to the final setting sun all that shall remain is a token of what we've said and done  When all we've had has been forsaken distant church bells no longer ring that's the sound of a heart taken and the story of tears from a king  The stones from my enemies these wounds will mend but I cannot survive the roses from my friends  This may be the last time I see you forgive me for holding you close this may be the last time that I see you so of this moment I will make the most  This may be the last time I see you but if you keep me in your heart together we shall be eternal if you believe we shall never part  The stones from my enemies these wounds will mend but I cannot survive the roses from my friends  - Ben Harper  thanks Rach!

      finals weren't as bad as I thought they would be. I'm very thankful that they demanded less of me than I thought they would.  other things that happened during finals week and the weeks and months before are a different matter entirely.  it's ok if my world has left me. maybe I will believe in another dream soon enough. if only the dreams would just go away. stop chasing the mirage. become it or deny its existence altogether.    forget...    forgive...   remember...   -------------------------------------------------------- someone told me that this comprises a meaningful life: 1) being able to support oneself 2) family 3) contributing to society  if everything really all boils down to that, and we are all on our separate paths to reach that... I guess the end result shouldn't be too bad.   rocks in the path only block the way temporarily... they are but obstacles that everyone must overcome.  if the path were so clear... what would be the point of the journey?   I make my own way.

      Smile at the fire extinguisher! ^_^    I've forgotten what this is and who it's by, but I still love it.    EPT? What is EPT?    I want a 1 lb. block of milk chocolate.    If you eat 20-30 packs of Twix, you tend to get sick of them.    Wow. You have GREEN teeth!    That's not a weird laugh. She's just being an elf.    Ahhh!!! So THAT is your plan. I will NOT pour this into my mouth so you can see the funny faces I make because it's so sour.    What is your plan?    Are you doing alright?    Did you find everything OK?    I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine! Here Squishy Squishy... here...    I'd like to introduce you to paper. It's quite convenient.    That is sooooo a phylum!!!    I appreciate the legitness.    Wow... the glue is HOT. Ouch! I'm never touching the tip of a hot glue gun again.    I need MORE red feathers!!!    Wow. Never used a hot glue gun and never seen Free Willy. You were such a deprived child.

       All the world's a stage,     And all the men and women merely players:     They have their exits and their entrances;     And one man in his time plays many parts,     His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,     Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.     And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel     And shining morning face, creeping like snail     Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,     Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad     Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,     Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,     Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,     Seeking the bubble reputation     Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,     In fair round belly with good capon lined,     With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,     Full of wise saws and modern instances;     And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts     Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,     With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,     His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide     For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,     Turning again toward childish treble, pipes     And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,     That ends this strange eventful history,     Is second childishness and mere oblivion,     Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.  - As You Like It; Act 2, Scene 7      I think that this is the English language at its best.    I would really enjoy seeing some of his plays performed. *sigh* If only I had the time and resources.

      I feel compelled to thank some people. Don't know why, especially since appreciation is still something I'm working on. But these are just my thoughts.   Thank you all  so much. I'm so grateful to know you.  Xi - You have no idea how much that means to me. To be able to trust and talk. It has been quite enjoyable. Can't wait until you get back and this year starts! I don't know if it will be "hell", but at least there's always going to be people like me and Jane going through it with you.  Naeem - It has been such a great experience getting to know you this summer. So many fun times. Thank you for just simply listening when I thought no one would. Thank you for being a voice of reason when I had none. Hope that you have a wonderful last year at Bellaire! [*sniffs* and don't forget us...]  David - Always a pleasure to hear you discuss your theories and to see your laughing fits. Hehe. So many amusing moments... too many to count. Well... since it  is  your birthday... have an awesome 16th year! Enjoy the presents that everyone is lavishing on you because you deserve them.

      At Hobby Lobby they have these things called "cool melt" hot glue guns. I wonder if those won't burn me. Hehe. But then... cool doesn't MELT. Argh. Therein lies my simply confused mind.  Can't wait for this year. The beginning always seems to be more promising than the end. Hmm.  I like this blog layout soooo much better than the xanga. *sighs* Why did we ever conform?!?!  I am baffled by our destructive decisions.
