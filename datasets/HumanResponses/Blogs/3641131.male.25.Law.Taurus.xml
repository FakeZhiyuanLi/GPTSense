      So there was a huge subway-workers strike in London today. People are having a bitch of a time getting to work. Didn't affect me, though. I've been walking to and from work ever since I moved to my new flat, only 30 minutes from the office. Anyway, walking to work today was surreal. The streets were just packed with people. It was kind of cool. I think I'll attempt to work out a walking commute to any job I ever have in a city. It's so much better than the subway. Not only does it cost a fortune to get a subway pass over here, but it's so fucking hot (in your suit, don't forget) and crowded during rush hour... Walking for 30 minutes to work is about a thousand times better than riding the tube for 5. (Although in fairness, unlike New York subways, the 'tube' here is relatively clean, spacious, well-lit, and there aren't many rats running around. Plus they have a digital sign that tells you  exactly how many minutes until the next train arrives  imagine that.. so you don't have to play the typical NYC subway game...  well...we've been waiting this long... this we should just cut our losses and leave?  Anyway, that just adds to my theory that London resembles Boston more than it does New York)  Also - I read that people that walk only half an hour a day cut their rates of heart disease by huge amounts. I'm so healthy!  When I first came out here to London, I was shocked at just how expensive the food was. I mean, NYC is pricey, but there's tons of great food to be had on the cheap. So my cheapness and laziness meant that I ate way too much fast food and junk food the first couple weeks I was here. Plus, the British absolutely love chocolate bars and all things Cadbury. They even have fucking candy bar vending machines in the fucking subway - so that didn't help.  But I've turned over a new leaf. I'm eating well. First of all, as a vacation student intern at the firm, all my meals at the firm's cafeteria are free! And it's damn good. As I've said before, lawyers at prestigious firms are very picky about their dining, and the shit here is fancy. They always have fancy meats and fish dishes, soups of the day, and a daily vegetarian option! So I had that today; in lieu of the Roast Chicken with Sage and Onion Stuffing I had the Baked Potato with Humous, Avocado and Sprouts, and it was damn good. Tasted a lot better than you would think, and I felt so healthy for eating like a vegetarian. I really wanted to try the other option though, Red Onion &amp; Goats cheese Tart Tatin! And I had my daily glass of fresh-squeezed OJ to go with it, of course.  Since my meals here are free, the temptation of course is to over-do it. I come early every day so I can get breakfast, and I've been grabbing those awesome 'full english' brekkies. But I try to limit that to egg on toast, some yogurt... maybe fruit salad. It takes willpower not to grab some free chocolate bars as well.  Another thing - whenever I'm in an office job setting I drink tons of water every day. I think I must go through at least 3 litres a day of the evian we have stocked in our kitchen, and that's in addition to all the tea, and hot chocolate I make when I'm bored. Drinking fluids all day gives you something to do to pass the time and a reason to leave the desk. I must have to take a piss every half hour. I have given up coffee though! I'm so much healthier than I was during finals. I'm so proud! Now I really won't feel bad about going totally nuts in Amsterdam.

      Apparently I don’t get paid till the end of the month. So that would be tomorrow...And I’m waiting. Because I get paid in pounds; and until I can use my NatWest British bank account I gotta use my American Citibank debit card at British ATMs and pay huge fees. So that means I try to take out as much £££ as possible at a time.  SO this morning I’m queuing for the cash machine or whatever they fucking call ATM’s over here. When I finally get up, I do my usual NYC trained streetwise thing, trying to nonchalantly type in my pin and pocket my £200 and get outta there before I get mugged. But right when I’m grabbing my ten £20s (each twenty note worth almost forty of our earth-dollars, mind you) I hear the dreaded ‘excuse me sir’ or whatever. First of all, I fucking hate being called Sir, even if this is London and even if I am wearing a fucking suit and tie worth at least much as the money I’ve just taken from the machine, and I especially hate being called Sir by some girl that can’t be more than 5 years younger than me. Ok, maybe she’s 16 or 17 at the least. She’s got clean white trainers (sneakers) on, designer jeans (they might have been Diesel, but I didn’t want to stare at her ass too closely), and a fucking parka that might have been Tommy Hillfiger, and you don’t see that shit in London too much (maybe Brixton or Essex, though). So this girl looks a lot cleaner than me, and healthier to boot. And I don’t think she’s been living on my affordable diet of packaged Sainsbury sandwiches and extra value Poundsaver meals like me. That’s the thing about Europe. You get to see attractive, young, white, able-bodied people asking you for money on the street like they’re asking the time of day or simply saying hi. The first day I was here, I was walking down to my old neighbourhood in the ‘dodgy’ area of Camden Town / Tufnell Park, and two black kids walked by me. They had a decent amount of bling, were decked out in Puma outfits that must have run them at least £150 each, and they were carrying Virgin Megastore shopping bags full of fucking CDS! I gave them the friendly nod, and they immediately stopped, as if having just thought of something… “oh, mate…. Do you think you could spare some cha…”. Motherfuckers, I thought. Do I look like a sucker? This is what eye-contact gets a guy in this country? Is it my skin color? Accent? My suit? (I’m really just a glorified intern, dammit). It can’t yet be my age, can it?  Anyway, this little punk has the nerve to ask me to give her money. I’m not sure if she asked for ‘change’, but there’s no way she could have gotten that, even if I’d wanted to give her, as all the money I had were the ten £20 notes I’d just yanked out of the machine. So I did my usual response – a bit more sarcastically than usual, to show my extra disproval caused by her age and appearance. (young white females may find they make more profitable hookers, but they must surely make worse beggars): “No thank you.” I smugly replied, as if she were offering me a favour, that I was gracious enough to decline. Then she replied with my favourite beggar rebuttal. “If you want, you can just buy me food.” Ahh, how rich! I had a vision of me taking this punk down to the west end’s finest restaurant – “table for two please” I’d announce. “It’s our first date”. Apparently, the bums (can you really call a teen that lives at home and petulantly asks for money on the way to school a bum?) have taken that old liberal’s excuse to heart (“but… but how can I be sure he won’t just spend it on drink or drugs”). And now they’re willing to allow you to cut out the middle man! Why, you can just buy me food! Lets walk over to KFC and buy me a Twister meal! Win win situation! Fuck that. I’m not going to buy food for any girl I’m not… well… that probably could have been arranged if I was willing to barter further, but I was not. I simply said “thanks for the offer [of buying you brunch] but I’ve got to go”. She could already tell I wasn’t the sucker type, and turned to walk down Tottenham.  Ok, this is the best part. Now I'm watching her go down the road stopped person after person (no luck at least, that makes me smile) and, get this, 10-20 feet behind her, her little sister is doing the same thing! This girl is probably 10 or 11! She'd walk up to some nice lady, the lady would stop, smile, look down, and the little bitch would ask for money! The people would get this funny look and hurry away, probably fearing her gangster daddy was around the corner, using his daughter to lure tourists to their doom. Anyway, I knew that this sister was going to hit me up next, so I thought quickly... and grabbed a flyer off the street. You know, one of those things that, from a distance, looks just like a real £20 note just to get your dumb ass to bend over and pick the motherfucker up. "Oooh £20 off my next furniture purchase at Crazy Bobby's house of shit, lucky me! Glad I picked this filthy trash of the fucking sidewalke!" So yeah, I grabbed that and put it in my pocket. So, ten seconds later she comes right up to me. "Do you thi....?" "SURE! How much do you want?! Is TWENTY enough for ya?" I reach into my pocket and give her the folder coupon. For a second her eyes grow wide in wonder. Had she really hit the motherload? She'd be in candy scrunchies for weeks! But when she has a second to look closer, her suspicions are confirmed. She looks up at me in fear more than anger, as if she knows anyone sick enough to do something like this to a child is really capable of just about anything, and turns to walk away, trailing her sister down Tottenham Court Road, hustling, hustling, looking for suckers.

      We all know Europeans are more polite, or at least more sedate, more staid. But they’re also the ultimate film geeks! So I enjoy seeing movies in British theatres, because they watch films the way I do – in absolute silence with rapt attention. There’s no talking, no yelling, no answering your mobile- and they even sit through the credits! (and they respect a good film, but they don’t fucking applaud – I hate that. Applauding at a movie is retarded unless the director is sitting in front of you – booing is always appropriate though). Of course, the Brits are much more open-minded about arty or foreign films, and not just at little arthouse cinemas (like the great Prince Charles theatre, which shows all sorts of cool shit for £2 to £4). It’s really cool to walk into a megaplex and notice that half the films are subtitled – I can’t imagine that ever happening in the States. But there’s a downside to the British reserve when it comes to watching film: While I like to watch the occasional arty French high-brow pseudo-intellectual yawn-fest with these people, they are absolutely no fun to watch comedy or action films with.  So I was leaving a really sober serious double-header on Sunday – I started with the amazing Errol Morris Documentary ‘The Fog of War’, a look at the life of Robert Strange McNamara, in his words, and if that wasn’t sobering enough, with its talk of nuclear war and its Phillip Glass soundtrack, I went straight from that to Mystic River, which, as the title suggests, was shot near where I was living while I was there doing my Boston Americorps gig. Anyway, that more was even more depressing, not only did I have to hear the A-list Hollywood cast give the most painfully affected Bahstahn accents I’ve heard since Good Will Hunting, but the overwrought melodrama was effectively tear-jerky thanks to some damn fine acting. So I walk from this double feature in a daze, and realize the only way to wake myself up was to sneak into Kill Bill v.2. This was a mistake. I know Vol. 2 doesn’t have the grind-house fun and loopy energy of Vol. 1, but I was still hoping some of the more inspired scenes (the training scene, the trailer fight) would wake me up. No dice. These euro-peons just sat there like logs. They were watching Kill Fucking Bill for chrisssakes, and there was no energy in the crowd. No yelling, cheering, screaming, laughing. A full house, mind you. Packed. (The British dig Tarantino, and make some pretty good gangster flicks of their own, as well.) They just made me conscious of how slow some and plodding much of Vol. 2 was. (My second time watching it just reinforced my original opinion, even more true for vol 2 than 1 - just like a pampered and over praised musician’s bloated double album, Tarantino turned what could have been one 2.5 hour masterpiece – with every moment awesome, a la Pulp Fiction, into two bloated films: awesome – but padded and plodding as well. The extra stuff would have made great DVD extras…and I would have been happy to watch every single great cut scene… hopefully he’ll release a DVD with both volumes edited down to one cut – until then I’m not even buying vol. 2).   Another thing about the British filmgoers – they allow themselves to be abused even worse than we Americans when it comes to the most horrible movie going trend in the last decade – they sit through 15 minutes of commercials! I don’t think it has gotten that bad at home yet.. but they sit through dozens of commercials, and I’m not talking about movie trailers, those come next. I hope that Americans will join me in protesting such a development – civil disobedience, yelling, popcorn throwing, or demand a refund should accompany 15 minutes of commercials after you’ve paid £10.50 (around TWENTY BUCKS!) for your seat. I always pay for my habit of compulsive punctuality, but never has it been this bad. Here’s a typical film, lets use a film I saw last weekend as an example…Bad Education, La Mala educación, a new film by Critically Worshipped Spanish Auteur Pedro Almodóvar:  6:30 – I get to the Odeon theatre in Leicester square, and join the queue. I’ve ducked out of work around 6pm, and jogged over here making sure I had plenty of time to spare – there is nothing I hate more than walking in late to a movie – little do I know that is far from a reasonable fear.  6:50 – I finally get to the head of the line (queue). I haven’t waited in line all my life as much as I have this summer. Sometimes I like to pretend I’m in Communist Russia. Queuing seems to be such an integral part of life it’s no wonder they have their own special word for it.   6:55 – I got my ticket! As always, I have just unsuccessfully argued for a student discount:  Me {brightly, with the hint of an ingratiating British lilt} – one ticket, student discount please!  Clerk: {in an unintelligible clipped cockney} Need ta’see yer aay yu ess mayth.  Me: {feigning ignorance/ dropping lilt / playing up clueless American accent} My what? Clerk: Yer eye you ess. International Union a Students. Me: Blimey. But I AM an international Student; see this – Columbia University – it’s in New York! It’s a very good school; some people think we’re even better than NYU! Anyway, that never works, and I end up paying a fee so amazingly high that it puts Manhattan first run prices to shame, but is almost as much as you pay to see a live fucking play in London! I mean, seriously… those things involve actual live human beings acting and dancing and (if you’re unlucky) singing about Cats or France right in front of you! And I’m not watching fucking Titanic over here, I’m paying about 20 bucks to watch some subtitled recording of a film that’s probably recouping its budget with profit thanks to me and the 17 people in the audience with me alone!   6:59 – Ahhh, I glance at my watch. Perfect Timing. I put my game boy advance SP away as the red curtains part. Yes. For some archaic reason the movie theatres in London have Curtains! Like you’re watching a play! The curtains open, and it’s a movie screen!! Of course I think this a way to get you to justify the fact that you’ve just paid enough for the actors to fly over and act (or in Almodovar’s case, have gay sex) live in front of you!  7:00 to 7:15 – Commercials!!! Nike Football (as in soccer). Gillette Razors. Austrailia! Yes, the fucking country is advertising, and between their crappy commercials, where they show a lot of hideously unattractive aborigines painting and singing songs and yodelling or whatever through their brown teeth while D. H. Lawrence tells use how tension evaporates and time stands still down under. I suppose time does feel like it’s standing still once you get to the Most Boring Place on Earth. I mean, anyone who’s travelled knows that the people you meet the most in the bars, hostels, trains, and bordellos the world over are the fucking Aussies. And you know why? Because they’re from fucking Australia! They can’t wait to leave! Their country got started as the place they sent you when you were bad!   7:15 to 7:29 – previews! Shitty movies that came out months ago in the States. Shitty looking pretentious French shit. A fucking documentary called the Weeping Camel about life for some tribe in some shitty Mongolian desert where life is so fucking boring even the camels are crying. (Replace the camels with kangaroos and you pretty much have my idea of life in Australia.)  7:29 – The curtain closes! WTF? Did the Nazis bomb these people stupid? The lights come on and we sit, staring at the red curtain for a full minute.  7:30 – The lights dim and the curtain opens again! Yaay! Now give me half an hour of my life back and we’re even! (you can even keep the 10 quid)  7:31 – The film finally starts! I was pleasantly surprised. It was like something Hitchcock would have made if he were a Spanish Faggot. The guy from Amores Perros and Y tu mamá también took a step into a role consistent with his desire to play continually gayer and gayer parts until he was doing gay porn.– and portrayed a disturbingly feminine drag queen. That guy is so cute (as ever girl I’ve ever met has reminded me, but yes, I admit that I can tell as well) that he even made a pretty fine girl. And I just know the girls love his Mexican metrosexuality. By the way, girls, he’s 5’6. So there.

      The invasion of Iraq was an 'enormous mistake' costing untold lives, strengthening Al-Qaeda, and breeding a new generation of terrorists, claims former White House counter-terrorism Czar Richard Clarke.  'The hatred that has been engendered by this invasion will last for generations,' he said.

      The Firm's summer party was pretty dope.  It was held on a grassy rooftop with an amazing view of the Thames, London Bridge, and the entire skyline.  There was a huge tent set up, and when it started raining (London, of course) we headed inside for BBQ, open bar, and watched the England v Portugal game.  England led 1 to nil the entire time, but with a few minutes left, Portugal scored and brought it to overtime.  Another Portuguese goal meant overtime was looking bad, but the Brits tied it up.  Then, the most shocking thing happened: England had a last minute goal that should have won the game in overtime, but the Swiss ref wouldn't allow it, claiming some sort of foul or other BS.  Then the game went to shoot-out/penalty, and England lost it.  (thanks to Beckham again).  Well, watching sure a nail-biting semi-final in a giant tent full of drunk Brits was intense!  Then I danced with the hottest vacation student at the firm for an hour, and requested that the DJ play In Da Club.  We stayed pretty late, and then she took a mini-cab home, and I took the cheaper night bus, but took it in the wrong direction and finally gave up and just walked all the way back to my dorm.

      "Al-Qaida may 'reward' American president with strike aimed at keeping him in office, senior intelligence man says"  This is what I fear.  And this CIA guy agrees in his new book.  Not only is Bush helping Bin Laden recruit tons of willing followers, but he's going to plan a major attack before the elections to rally the US around Bush and get him elected.  And I think that's exactly what's going to happen.  You'll see.  I hope I'm around to see it as well.  Quotes follow.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/alqaida/story/0,12469,1242638,00.html  Anonymous believes Mr Bush is taking the US in exactly the direction Bin Laden wants, towards all-out confrontation with Islam under the banner of spreading democracy.    Imperial Hubris  is the latest in a relentless stream of books attacking the administration in election year. Most of the earlier ones, however, were written by embittered former officials. This one is unprecedented in being the work of a serving official with nearly 20 years experience in counter-terrorism who is still part of the intelligence establishment.   Anonymous, who published an analysis of al-Qaida last year called Through Our Enemies' Eyes, thinks it quite possible that another devastating strike against the US could come during the election campaign, not with the intention of changing the administration, as was the case in the Madrid bombing, but of keeping the same one in place.   "I'm very sure they can't have a better administration for them than the one they have now," he said.   "One way to keep the Republicans in power is to mount an attack that would rally the country around the president."

      It was great.  I don't normally like musicals, because they're tame, predictable, and cheesy - but this wasn't a musical, it was an  opera !  That means that every word of dialogue, except for Jerry's (and his faithful bodyguard, Steve) was sung in opera fashion - none of that cheesy break into musical number shit here.  So it was obviously hilarious during the first act, where the guests sing about their typical springer secrets and problems (chicks with dicks, diaper fetish, crackwhores, strippers, lesbians, etc.  And it's nice and vulgar too - there's nothing funny than when the Springer guest springs his 'surprise' on his poor spouse and she/he responds with a nice  what the fuck!?! ).  But the second act was amazing to, where Springer goes to Hell, not, as I feared, to pay for his sin of lowering daytime TV to even trashier levels, but to moderate a special talk show for Satan, who has beef with Jesus, as well as God.  (Satan to Jesus: FFFFFuck YOU! Jesus:TTTTalk to the hand!)  I won't spoil more than this, but I'll just say it'll be interesting to see if this show survives its upcoming trip to Broadway.  American audiences are, in my opinion, way too dogmatic, religious, and close-minded, to accept an opera where Jesus (and, by extension, his followers, - AKA Mel Gibson) gets rightfully criticized for being so fixated on his crucifixion.  "Grow the fuck up, other people suffer in this world.... and put some clothes on" is basically what they say to him.  Well put.

      Comic Genius Dave Chappelle vs. catchphrase-spewing morons:  "Shouts continued to interrupt Chappelle's routine until he stopped to give a lecture on "how comedy usually works: I say something. You mull it over and decide whether you want to laugh or not, and then you do or not. Then I say something else, and you think about that.   "It's worked well all across the country, but you people ..."   Performing in Sacramento, the comic said, might turn out "to be a bad idea - like chocolate-covered fish."   Chappelle told the crowd he knew why they liked his sketch-comedy show: "Because it's good. You know why my show is good? Because the network officials say you're not smart enough to get what I'm doing, and every day I fight for you. I tell them how smart you are. Turns out, I was wrong.   "You people are stupid."   http://www.sacticket.com/24hour/entertainment/tv/news/story/1441687p-8798481c.html  Chappelle, obviously, will not pander to his fans. "You guys are the worst listeners in the country," he told the Sacramento audience. "It's like 'The Silence of the Lambs.' Without the silence."

      Well.. I went to the vacation student cocktails yesterday, met some very nice British solicitor wannabees (Lawyers are either Solicitors or Barristers over there, not sure about the diff, other than that Barristers are more like judges).  And I got talked into going to the firm's summer party tomorrow nite.  I'm kinda fearing it... drinks, bbq, disco, prizes, at a beautiful locale by the river...  We'll see how that goes.  Tonite I'm going to see The Jerry Springer Opera with a friend from work.  I hear it's awesome.

      A typical 'full English' consists of the following: Eggs, Bacon, Sausage, Tomato, Baked Beans, Mushrooms, Toast, Tea  I was complaining that you can't just get a decent bagel and cream cheese in this country - but today I found one! Of course, since we're in England, it didn't just have cream cheese on it, but enough bacon to give a dog a heart attack.  One perk of working at a big law firm is that they usually have cafeterias with really good food.  The one here has this awesome machine that squeezes oranges for you while you watch - now that's fresh OJ!  I'm trying to ween myself off the coffee addiction I picked up during finals, and a nice healthy glass of OJ is way better than coffee, or even great English tea, any morning.  By the way - I've met two people in my life who claimed they never drank a cup of coffee in their entire lives!  WTF - that's just not normal.  Is it a coincedence that they were both raging assholes?  I think not.  (Now that I think of it, I bet a lot of the Mormons at my school haven't had a cup of coffee - but these two assholes I'm thinking of weren't Mormons - say what you will about Mormons and their retarded religion, most Mormons are excessively nice, and not assholish in the least)

      Yesterday Ralph Nader announced his running mate, and it looks like he'll be on the ballot in the battleground states, like Florida.  This is bad news, in the sense that Nader obviously has no decency, and, although I doubt he'll actually end up as a spoiler in this election, he seems to secretly want to spoil it for the Dems because he believes that the only way to get this country going where he wants (which aint going to happen) is to start by making it as bad as possible.  He'd love to see Bush drag us backwards for four more years.    urlLink This guy  has some advice about what you should say to any punkass Nader supporters.  Now, like most Democrats, he's mainly worried about all of Bush's backwards social policies, like marriage, abortion, etc.  That stuff means very little to me.  I'm not gay and I'm not a chick.  I got bigger things to worry about.  If Bush actually wins this time out I wouldn't be surprised if he starts sending fornicators to concentration camps and tattooing the ten commandments on our balls, but that's too be expected when you elect leaders who live their lives based on the ancient wisdom of their ancient soap opera myths.  I live in New York City, and call me a pussy, but mainly I think Bust must lose, for our safety: here's a quick piece I ripped from Salon: " Even now, however, America's critics continue to distinguish between the U.S. administration, which they fear and despise, and the American people, with whom they feel sympathy.  But the pictures from Abu Ghraib prison may have finally changed that. If the American electorate, knowing what it knows and, above all, having seen what it has seen, proceeds to reelect George W. Bush in November, the moderating distinction between the American administration and the American people will be eroded or perhaps erased -- with what violent consequences no one can predict.  " This is why we can't elect W - it would make us, the American people, culpable and worthy targets of their rage over our policies.  So back to Nader.  He's an asshole because he knows he's doing the wrong thing and still does it.  And he's a huge pussy that thinks all speed limits should be 55 mph (he predicted a 'bloodbath' when the limits were raised just to 65 - wrong on that one, wimp).  I went to a Nader rally once.  It was fucked up.  I felt like I was among Hitler Youth, or some fucked up Scientologist retreat.  It was cool hearing Patti Smith perform, and Janeane Garofalo was funny.  I mean, she was in super-liberal political mode, but she was able to do it without coming across as overly abrasive and bitchy like she often seems; (or politically clueless and out of place like D.L. Hugley seemed - although he probably knew more than the average Nader kid did).  (And what especially pissed me off was that the entire crowd seemed to assume that if you were a Green/environmentalist you were pro-Palestinian.  Fuck the Palestinians.  They don't want fucking peace!  And they want you hippy motherfuckers just as dead as they want the rest of us infidels.  Even Clinton comes out and blames Arafat for ruining the 2000 peace process in his new book.)  At least W probably thinks he's doing the right thing.  He probably thinks he's pleasing his God, or at least his big corporate handlers.  W's probably a decent enough guy.  I'd rather hang out with him than Gore.  Gore was the reason he lost, not Nader.  (I'd first put the blame on that badly designed ballot though - bad design changes the course of history!).  Gore  had the rare talent of being simultaneously wooden and prissily affected.  Bush is a brazen pawn of big business.  (check out his new plan to  urlLink get drug companies to screen the population  for 'mental problems' and medicate them!  That sounds great!  If your favorite books are 1984 and Brave New World!  Of course, when you think of big business, you think Dick.  Dick Cheney is a pile of shit.  I was especially moved by  urlLink today's USA today editorial , pleading for that android to step down because his ties the oil industry, Halliburton, Chalabi, Enron, and every other scumbag thing he's ever done could hurt W's election chances.  Of course, the thought that some of the slimeballs on W's staff could actually hurt his chances in November made me smile.  I also had to laugh at the absurdity this; we know asking Bush to kick Cheney out is like asking a marionette to cut the strings connecting him to the puppeteer.  But I also laughed because the retard that penned this column ended it by saying   "Remind your boss that he is the heir to the Reagan political legacy, and the keeper of the values that Reagan espoused. For those values to triumph in 2004, it may be necessary for you to take a hit for the team, so that President Bush can win one for the Gipper."  Oh God.  That's great!  I love hearing win one for the Gipper!  I can never hear that enough!  That sounds so fucking retarded.  Or, as would more likely offend conservatives, that sounds fucking GAY!  The Gipper!  Win it for the Gipper!  Win it for Drooly McVegetable!  Win it for Diaper McSenile!  No...  you can't do stem cell research to CURE the Gipper, but you win it for him, and you make him proud!  We know - it's always a tragedy when a brain-dead 93 year old man finally gives up the ghost.  But maybe sending more 20 year olds to their death at the hands of camel-fucking soap-fearing zealots will make it all better.  W's life seems to be motivated by his Oedipal (is that how it's spelled) impulses to live up to his father and his horrible failings - it reminds you how Bush 41 was a star athlete and a stellar student and his no-good son was a cheerleader, C student, failed oil man, and lousy drunk asshole.  I'll leave you with the speech W would make if he were a decent man about why he's not seeking 're'-election.  "Well, I really tried to do the right thing concerning Iraq. I really thought that getting rid of Saddam would make us safer, give us a base in the middle east, get us access to oil, and that the Iraqis would be glad and grateful for it. Unfortunately we were wrong. It's been a disaster, and it's hurt our efforts to curb terrorism and helped Al Quaeda's recruiting by increasing global anti-American sentiment to record levels. I've fallen prey to the half-baked theories of neo-conservative academics and industry assholes, like my vice-president, Dick, and the entire Enron/Halliburton crew. I'm very sorry for everything. I will not seek re-election. I hope we can immediately establish a government in Iraq and shift our focus back where it ought to be, on Afganistan, and also on hunting for the terrorists in Pakistan and, most of all, Saudi Arabia."

      NEWS FLASH: Now that my old Torts Prof. has stepped down as Dean to become the prez of Rice University in Bumblefuck Texass, he's been replaced by.... Prof. David W. Schizer! Never had him. Dude's a Tax Prof...  Wow, this guy's only 35! "According to Columbia Law's press office, Mr. Schizer is the 14th dean since 1858, and the youngest in the institution's history. " (Besides, he added, "The Constitution says I'm old enough to be president of the United States.")  I think after all the taxing tax issues I'm doing this summer I'll avoid tax classes next year, but I sure could use them now.  ("I teach tax. I think [students] take the course because they feel they need it, not because they're thrilled by the subject," he said. "Then they find out it's about allocating resources of society and structuring the economy, and other kinds of deep and important questions — and it turns out that it's a delightful intellectual experience.)  {Article by Thomas Adcock, New York Law Journal, 06-21-2004}

      So yeah, I'm on the job. Working as a legal intern in a law firm during my 1L summer. I have nothing but sheer, white-hot, burning hatred for those of you that snagged big firm summer associate gigs for your first year. {For the non-law readers, those lucky SOBS are getting paid $2,400 a week for a glorified summer camp experience where a big firm shows them the ropes, gets to know them, and in then end makes them offers for full-time employment unless they get really drunk and punch a partner in the face at a dinner party.}   And I have nothing but pity from those of you that allowed yourself to be suckered into 'unpaid internships' with government or public interest firms. It's absolutely unforgivable that they expect you to pay out of your pocket for the privledge of working for them - to spend your summer working full time, giving up your precious time, and losing money after paying for your housing and transportation and food! It's a scam, and they're taking advantage of you. I've always refused these bogus 'internships' and if everyone did likewise the exploitation would cease. But until then, I hope at least you got the school to pay you, with one of those bullshit public interest summer grants, which is really just you paying, again, since it comes from your, or my, tuition.  Nope, I'm getting paid barely enough to break even, living and working in the 2nd best city on earth (after NYC), and learning a new language (here they call fries 'chips' - and to them chips are 'crisps' - what morons!)  Sincerely- A. Rice

      So yesterday I wrote a bit about my experience being 'locked-in' at a pub with a lot of gay Europeans. I'm still laughing about the whole 'watering hole' comment ("ya, zee other pond is full of heteros"), so here's some other things I learned that night. As background, let me share some sociology I observed about the urban gay community. I noticed that there were two kinds of gay men hanging out that night: 1) the older, flabbier, balder, rich 'sugar daddies' and 2) their 'younger, cuter, 'rent boy' types that lived off of the type 1's.  So the guy that owned the bar and provided all the free drinks was a type 1, obviously; and I saw two or three other type 1's. Each type 1 had a very nice flat in Chelsea that type 2's were free to hang out at anytime, crash at, drink, smoke, etc. We dropped by a few of these on the way out of the bar. It was very interesting- everyone was still going strong after 6am, the flats were (as expected) impeccably decorated, and the ratio of type 1s to type 2s was usually 1 to 3. I mostly enjoyed talking to the type 1's because they were much smarter than the type 2's, and were obviously very rich. Some of them seemed to have families or children, and it was funny to think of them getting a divorce and giving up family life to live in a trendy London flat with a rotating crew of rent boys gigoloing them. What must the kids think.  But mostly I talked to the various type 2's that were leeching off of whichever type 1 owned the bar or flat that I was in at the time. They probably assumed I was one of them, another guy that was willing to flatter/hang out/???? with an aging queen if it meant living rent free and getting nice gifts. I wish I'd asked them more personal questions. I really don't know how 'far' these type 2's typically have to go for the type 1 sugar daddy to take them under his wing. It seemed that more than a few of them were at least bi-ish (hell, they might have been gay for pay at the worst) - I was talking about nyc with one of them and he started telling us about how much more he liked American girls than their British counterparts before quickly apologizing ("I mean, I don't know if you guys are into girls at all, but...." he started before I told him I was straight, and went off on my own analysis on the pros and cons of the girls of both nations.)  I actually really liked that guy. He was so enamored with nyc and with me because I said I was from there (at least I think that's why). So some of these rent boys were pretty cool, the struggling actors, dancers, writers, etc etc. But some were really stupid, like the self-proclaimed philosopher who gave me his life's work to read - some incoherent spiritual and pseudo-scientific philosophy that I could tell was pretty retarded even in my beyond inebriated state. Also, I used to think that all gay men were born with a keen genetic insight into all things artistic, but I now know better than to trust that stereotype (or maybe they weren't gay at all.. my 'gay for pay' theory)  Some highlights of my drunken convo's with vapid rent boys ( warning, this is not going to be of interest to anyone that isn't an intellectual film and lit snob like me ) :    We were talking about the Beat gang, those fifties guys like Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs, etc. I thought this would be a topic that my gay companions would find stimulating, and I hoped to impress them by telling them that I live in the same Columbia apartment building Kerouac once did (and frequent the same bar, The West End, his crew did in the 40s). So I'm pedantically critiquing On the Road when one of the rent boys pipes up: "You know my favorite Beat Novel? Blade Runner!" Oh god.*  Then we were talking about Lars von Trier**, the overrated Danish director who started Dogme 95, the filmmaking collective that only makes movies on handheld cameras, shooting on location with found props. "Oh, Dogma!" Piped up a rent boy - "The movie with Matt Damon!"  Then, to my utter amusement- one kid had just seen The Weeping Camel and Bad Education the night before and, since I seemed to know so much about film, wanted to test his theories on me. Oh no.. you might remember my lengthy discussion of those films from  urlLink this post . Anyway, he was very excited about sharing his insights with me: he said that those films reminded him, thematically, of Caseblanca! A fucking movie about a fucking camel reminded him of the classic Bogey WW2 flick! I couldn't make this shit up if I tried. Anyway, I was very polite, I ignored his camel comparison, because I knew I'd fucking crack up if I even thought about it, but I commended him on his astuteness comparing Bad Education with Caseblanca "Well, actually Bad Education is a tribute to Hitchcock's films, especially Vertigo, and not Caseblanca, but I guess you're close."***    *{I didn't know where to begin with that one... first of all, the movie  urlLink Blade Runner   urlLink was based on  the novel  urlLink Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep , and was published in 1968. Anyway, Philip K Dick is one of my favorite authors, but his work ain't beat. But I guess I can understand the confusion. I have some drug-addled hippie friends that are really into Dick (snicker), mind- and reality-bending drugs, gnosticism, and the rest of Dick's crazy genius schitzo crap. (If you're not familiar with Dick, don't worry, for now should just know he's the dude that wrote the books that the movies Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report were based on - there's a great movie coming out soon called A Scanner Darkly, and it's going to be awesome, directed by Richard Linklater and based on Dick's book of the same name, that's going to teach the masses about Dick.}    **Lars von Trier is an asshole who doesn't film his stridently anti-American movies in America because he's never been, and refuses to go, to American, not that that stops him from writing movies telling everyone how awful America is. Also, he's apparently such a horrible person to work for that Nicole Kidman dropped out of his anti-American trilogy "USA - Land of Opportunities" after only filming the first movie, Dogville, and Bjork says she'll never act again after starring in his only decent film, Dancer in the Dark.    *** I also didn't ask him if he noticed the true theme of Bad Education - the connection between gays, actors and whores. You see, in Bad Education an actor lets a gay director sleep with him to get a film role - I wondered if this rent boy saw any parallels to his own living situation in that film...

      On my last night in London I attended a pub '"lock in"! London, much like Boston, has a law where pubs have to close at 11pm. (Yeah, that sucks; You can go to bars and clubs until 6am, but that usually entails paying a huge cover.) So a lock-in occurs when you're at a pub and they shut and lock the doors, dim the lights, and keep on drinkin on the down-low.  Anyway, I went to one and it was really cool - it was an open bar free for all. The staff kept handing us drink after drink, and letting us go behind the bar to serve ourselves - I learned how to correctly pour a Guinness.  The pub owner was a friend of a friend of mine - a gay Austrian that called everyone 'dahling', and sounded exactly like the Ali G Austrian journalist character (ya, Bin Laden is so stylish, ya). He told us about the best place for gays in London - a male-only swimming hole. I asked how there could possibly be a men-only swimming area, and he said that's because it's for orthodox Jewish men, who can't swim co-ed. I cracked up, laughed in his face, and couldn't stop. I didn't mean to be impolite, but I was drunk, and thinking of a swimming hole soley populated by Orthodox Jews and flamboyant gay men - thinking of those two groups swimming together, was the funniest thing I have ever pictured in my head.

      Sup.  Just got back to Eastern time.  I woke up early - 10 am, and it felt like I'd slept til 4pm.  That's the best thing about flying back west - reverse jet-lag.   So having a blog is like having a fucking Tamagotchi.  Just another thing you feel bad about for putting off and ignoring.  So I felt kinda bad for not updating, especially when so many coffeeshops in Amsterdam double as cybercafes, many, like my favorite, Abraxis, give you free internet time with any purchase.  Abraxis also happens to be across the street from my new favorite restaurant,  urlLink  Supper Club  .  You dine lying on cushions, in your socks (and perhaps a kimono), watching the live DJ and dancers, as hip b-boys, artists, models, and drag queens serve you a 5 course meal on trays.  The salad was decorated with a mousetrap and the flan was served in an ashtray.    The crowd was really cool, it's like one of those secret bars in New York that are hidden away behind nondescript doors in alleys and operate soley via word of mouth.  I asked if they wanted to bring it to NYC, and they said it wouldn't work there, that the concept would fizzle after a week or so, and the crowd wouldn't be as cool.  I dunno.  Weekend nights are members only, and I can only imagine how wild and crowded it gets on the cushions, beds, and balconies.  It was pretty awesome on a Tuesday.  Another highlight, we went to a dingy little comedy club on Max Euplein, which is a cool square in Amsterdam, named after a famous dutch chess player, where people play chess in public on a giant board with pieces as big as children.  (I found it because it was where my favorite London restaurant chain, Wagamama, has one of its only non-England branches.  Wagamama is a hip little Japanese noodle chain where you can get some amazing Ramen.  I'm surprised that restaurant isn't in NYC either.).   Ok, I'd seen some film crews in Amsterdam - Rob Schneider and Eddie Griffin were in town shooting the sequel to Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigalo, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalo.  So, we're sitting in the front row of this tiny little stage tucked away in the bottom of an Amsterdam basement bar, there's probably only a couple dozen people in the crowd, and suddenly Eddie Griffin gets on stage!  I was shocked.  It was pretty surreal and I'm pretty sure he was on something.  But it was very interesting.  He obviously just walked in and took the stage on a whim; he wasn't putting on a show per se, or running through his typical, prepared material, but he also wasn't really testing out new material or anything.  He started out that way, with some pretty funny stuff about Amsterdam, the kind of observations I'd make (the people are crazy, they all ride bikes, and they will run over your ass on them).  Then he started complaining about how a world famous star like him comes over here for free to entertain us, but the comedy club owners won't even give him a free bottle of champagne, even though you know the next day they'll advertise about how Eddie Griffin was at their comedy club.  He was drinking a bottle, but he said he had to pay for it himself.  Then he complained that the Dutch people were treating him like "any old nigga" despite his wealth and fame.  I theorized that this is either because the Dutch aren't as celebrity obsessed as the LA sycophants he's used to, or because they don't recognize him, but he didn't seem to consider those possibilities and complained that he hadn't gotten much action in the two weeks he'd been in Amsterdam.   Then he ran out of stuff to talk about and let the audience shout out topics for him to talk about or people for him to imitate.  He's a pretty talented impressionist.  When someone shouted out Bob Marley, he did an entire song and really got into it.  It wasn't really him doing a shtick, but trying to really get into Bob Marley's skin.  Then I shouted out Sammy Davis Jr, but he didn't want to do that.  (I now realize that I thought he was the guy who did those impressions of Sammy on Living Color or whatever, but I was thinking of that Tommy Davidson guy, so maybe that's why he ignored my request.)  People asked him to talk shit about Eddie Murphey and David Spade, but he declined to.  He did some pretty good impressions of Bono, Oasis, Mike Tyson, and Michael Jackson.  Then he started talking about Michael Jackson, which was really fucking interesting - because he wasn't 'doing MJ jokes', he was talking his experience being one of Michael Jackson's few remaining celebrity friends and supporters, someone that Michael needs to tell him 'like it is'.  He talked about leaving the courtroom with Michael the time Michael jumped on that limo and did a dance for the press.  And about how he told Michael if he wants to win his case all he has to do is get on the stand, whip out his 'giant' cock, and ask the jury how on earth 'little Timmy could take all of that'.  I think it was pretty cool and extremely weird to think that this is how Eddie Griffin jokes around in private with Michael Jackson.  And not only does Eddie absolutely maintain that Michael is totally innocent, but he was saying he's talked to girls Michael "was with" and that's how he knows that Michael is hung like a horse.  Then Eddie got even more unhinged and crazy, and started talking about paranoid conspiracy theories.  It's about this time I theorized that he was on some sort of drug, and it didn't seem like pot.  At this point he'd been on stage, rambling, doing impressions, and jumping from topic to topic for over an hour.  He started by talking about the conspiracy against Michael Jackson: the people that want to frame, ruin, and bankrupt Michael because he's "black" (apparently) and "owns the Beatles".  Then he started to get into shit that I was in no state to even attempt to follow, like numerology - I guess some foreign guy in the audience asked him about something politically or something, and he went off about Bin Laden being Bush's first cousin, and them each owning one of the World Trade Center Towers, and then started dissing the Jesus mythology, and explaining his own religious philosophy (from what I could gather from the tirade he pretty much maintains we're all God).  Then he promised us proof of his beliefs and went into an amazingly complex numerology explanation, where he'd prove that 666 was actually gods number by flipping it and adding and subtracting.  I have no idea what was going on, but I think we ended up concluding that 9 is the number of man, 6 the number of god, and 7 the number of the devil.  Then he had the audience do some multiplication.  And I swear to God, for about 10 minutes, I was in a tiny club in Amsterdam, and Eddie Griffin was quizzing us on our multiplication, like he was a third grade teacher, and we were his class.  You haven't lived until you've been totally fucked up and Eddie Griffin is pointing at you and demanding to know what 9 times 12 is.  UPDATE: I just saw Eddie Griffin being interviewed on VH1 and he said he got the part to play Sammy Davis Jr. in a new movie and then did a spot on impression, complete with a lazy (glass) eye!  WTF!

      So it's my last day at work as a legal intern / vacation student at my posh white-shoe law firm in London's magic circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;I just turned in my ID card, which made me a little sad because I wanted to save it because it's a souvenir,&nbsp;and&nbsp;also because&nbsp;it's got a pretty bad-ass looking picture of me on it (I look pretty fucking jet-lagged and slothful; but it doesn't hold a candle to the mug shot on my old food stamp ID card from my poverty days as an Americorps fag - I didn't shower or shave for 3 days because I wanted the most thugged-out ghetto food stamp I.D. card possible, and I got it).   I also picked up my paycheck and I'm in an awesome mood cuz:  1) They accidentally paid me for next week, even though I told them, over and over, that I'm taking the last week of July to do some research on Amsterdam's drug and obscenity laws.  2) There were NO TAXES taken out of my paycheck!&nbsp; Being a foreign student is awesome!  3) The £ is so strong against the $ right now that I ended up with what I'd consider a pretty damn impressive&nbsp;salary once you convert it to dollars!   So I'll be spending&nbsp;the next week&nbsp;traveling a bit before coming back to the States.&nbsp; Will I survive my trip to Amsterdam?&nbsp; Will I continue to 'blog' after I've been re-acquainted with my Gamecube, cable tv, and beer that doesn't cost over seven bucks a pint?&nbsp; Stay tuned for the answers.  ------------------------  What to do without me?&nbsp;     Play  urlLink this awesome Castlevania game , which is what I did all day at work today.  You can re-read my most popular post,  urlLink You Might Be a Gunner .  Check out some of the books I particularly enjoyed this summer.&nbsp; (It takes the shit they make you read as a 1L to really let you appreciate it when you can go back to reading for pleasure):   urlLink   &nbsp; The Watchmen - This is perhaps the greatest graphic novel (that's what we intellectuals call comic books) ever made. It's like a postmodern superhero story. Kinda invented that whole gothic, world-weary crimefighter, pre-millennium tension thing that's been imitated in countless comics and movies. (And check out the cover story on genius author Alan Moore in today's Salon.com - he bashes Bush hardcore)   urlLink Yellow Dog  - the latest book by my favorite postmodern British author, Martin Amis. A lot of people don't like this book as much as his others, but I thought it was hilarious and fucked-up.    urlLink The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  - A great book that's narrated by a kid with  urlLink Aspergers . Aspergers, for those of you that don't know, is a mild form of Autism; those suffering from Aspergers are often indistinguishable from Gunners: the symptoms are often social isolation, bizarre behavior, odd speech patterns and inflections (but good grammar and a high verbal IQ), clumsiness, and "a circumscribed area of interest which usually leaves no space for more age appropriate, common interests". I have diagnosed some of the gunners I've observed with Aspergers, and may write a paper on the phenomenon someday.    urlLink Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  - the latest collection of essays by David Sedaris. As someone that just started reading blogs and blogging himself, I find this book more interesting than his earlier ones. Why? David Sedaris doesn't write fiction, he just writes about the funny shit that happens in his life, and does it well. I want to know how he can continue to find funny and interesting things to write about now that he's successful enough to write fulltime. He must have a much harder time finding interesting topics now that he no longer works weird jobs with weird people.  And don't forget about the cool Sci-Fi stuff I talked about before:  urlLink Snow Crash ,  urlLink I, Robot , and the coolest computer game ever,  urlLink Deus Ex .   So long, I'm going to leave work, finally beat Deus Ex (I have to decide if I should join the Illuminati and rule the world, merge with the Helios AI program and rule the world, or destroy the mainframe and bring a new dark age upon the earth), pack up, and pick up O-dogg at the airport.   Keep it real,  Ava

       Republicans have run out of bumper stickers that declare:  'Kerry is Bin Laden's Man.&nbsp; Bush is Mine.'&nbsp;  The stickers went like hot cakes when they were handed out in Kentucky.&nbsp; But Democrats said the slogan equated a decorated Vietnam veteran with 'one of the greatest enemies of the United States'.&nbsp; 'It goes way over the line,' said a party spokesman.    Yeah, not only is the bumper sticker 'a bit over the line', but it's completely backwards.&nbsp; BUSH is Bin Laden's man.&nbsp; The Bushes are the ones with the close ties to the Bin Ladens.&nbsp; As Michael Moore tells anyone that cares to listen, BUSH is the one with the many personal and financial&nbsp;ties to the Bin Laden family&nbsp;and the Saudi Royal family:  &nbsp;   The Bin Ladens have had business relations with Bush and his family for 25 years.In 1977 Dubya got financing for his oil business "Arbusto" from his Texas Air National Guard (AWOL buddy) James A. Bath.&nbsp; (The name you saw blacked out in Fahrenheit 9/11).&nbsp; James A. Bath had been hired by Osama's brother, Salem bin Laden, to invest the bin Laden's money, and so $50,000 (5% of control of Arbusto) came from Mr. Bath.  Dubya's father, number 41, is a highly paid consultant for the Carlyle Group, and one of the investors in Carlyle was the bin Laden family.&nbsp; Dubya, until 1994, headed a company called CaterAir, which was owned by Carlylye.     All this was happening when the bin Laden's not only had NOT cut their ties to Osama, but they continued to fund him, and continue to this day, as they have been doing for years.   The Taliban was invited to Texas (WHILE THEY WERE HIDING OSAMA) so Unocal could talk them into letting it build a pipeline through Afghanistan.&nbsp; At this time Dubya met with the Uzbek ambassador on behalf of ENRON's "Kenny Boy" Lay (last seen taken away in handcuffs).&nbsp; But after Al Qaeda blew up our African embassies it was clear that Clinton was not going to let Bush's friends at Unocal, Halliburton, and Enron do their pipeline business with terrorists.&nbsp; So a new regime was needed, and corrupt Enron became one of the biggest contributors to Bush's corrupt campaign.    BUSH hindered the hunt for Bin Laden; he:&nbsp;  &nbsp; 1) Took the pressure off Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban by focusing our troops on the Iraq distraction.  &nbsp;&nbsp;2) Sent a severely underpowered military force to Afghanistan, and was consequently unable to catch any of the Taliban or al&nbsp;Qaida bigwigs.  &nbsp; 4) Allowed hundreds of Saudis to be flown out of the country on 9/13, where they couldn't be properly interrogated by the authorities.&nbsp;  &nbsp; 5) Never put any pressure on his Saudi buddies to actually cooperate with our 9/11 investigations&nbsp;(But that's not surprising, Bush and the White House have not been cooperating with the 9/11 investigation, either - I especially love how Dubya couldn't testify alone, he had to bring along his boss, Cheney.)   BUSH has helped Al Qaeda more than Bin Laden&nbsp;could have hoped for in his wildest dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;   After the unnecessary Iraq war, and the Abu Graib disgrace (the worst is yet to come on that) - Al Qaeda recruiting is up worldwide.&nbsp; I think we all know who Bin Laden would vote for.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that Bin Laden definitely wants Bush to win -&nbsp;Bush could hardly be doing a better job of&nbsp;playing into Bin Laden's plans to unite Muslim countries against the West and&nbsp;build up enough anger to overthrow US-friendly Arab governments.  &nbsp;  BUSH IS BIN LADEN'S MAN.   Bush is such a good friend to the Saudis and the bin Ladens that he is incapable and unwilling to take on Al Qaeda and its money trail that leads directly to his close friends and business partners.&nbsp; This is a flagrant conflict of interests, and it's obvious that, by trying to have it both ways, to take on Al Qaeda while not offending his Saudi buddies, Bush is not on our side.&nbsp; A wise man once said that you're either with us or you're with the terrorists - and Bush is with the terrorists.&nbsp;   So the Republicans ignore this.&nbsp; They have something Kerry doesn't have, a lot of fucking nerve.&nbsp; How else can they criticize a man who earned a purple heart in Vietnam and had the courage and foresight to condemn the war upon his return, and laud&nbsp;the man who was AWOL snorting coke off of mexican whores during the war, then bumbled his way into the presidency where he's currently doing his best to&nbsp;give us all another Vietnam.   As  urlLink Don Kerris  says, this is not the time for compassion and healing.&nbsp; Friends, we must remember that experiences like these show what people are truly made of. I don't know about you, but at the moment, I am made of incandescent fury.

        Your mother  does  work here!&nbsp; You don't need to clean up after yourself when you work at a big law firm: leave&nbsp;the dirty mugs and plates you&nbsp;at your desk and in the morning they're all washed and back in the kitchen!  Take advantage of the firm kitchen/break room!&nbsp; Free Coffee, Hot Coco, and Tea!&nbsp; But don't steal the secretary's yoghurt from the fridge - she will  never forgive you .  They spell yogurt  yoghurt  in London.&nbsp;&nbsp;How gay!  Tea in London just tastes better than it does in the States  The magazines on the coffee table in your firm's reception area / lobby are for clients only!&nbsp; Don't steal the latest issue of GQ, even if it's the one with Beckam on the cover and that article about Skull and Bones.  If you live in zone 1, you can walk to work in approximately the same time it would take to wait for the subway- especially if you have to switch lines.  They call the subway the  tube,  in London.&nbsp; That is beyond gay.  British people are apparently so mature that their newspapers can show tits and use the f-word - and they really spell it out - none of that "f--k you a-----e, said Cheney" bullshit.  England has no term limits: Here's wishing a happy 10th anniversary as Prime Minister to Tony Blair, too bad Slick Willy couldn't be celebrating his 12th anniversary along with you.  The British are starting to&nbsp;produce some decent&nbsp;rap music: Dizzee Rascal and The Streets are awesome.  Never get married, but if you do, know that if you get divorced, if you're a man, you're going to get screwed unless&nbsp;you know about a really good attorney.&nbsp; And be resigned to the fact that you're going to have to pay him a ton of cash and he's going to have some intern hunting through your financial records, wills, and trusts, and reading about all your financial secrets.  British people actually watch subtitled films that aren't about Jesus - and they don't talk during the movie.  Taxi drivers in London speak English and&nbsp;know their way around the city!  London recently beat out Tokyo as the world's most expensive city!  Indian food in London is better than in New York, but the Chinese is worse.  If your friend is working as a summer associate in Cravath, don't plan on catching any plays with her - she won't ever be able to get out of work in time.  My law firm has showers, but no gym....  "Air conditioning?&nbsp; Who needs it?"&nbsp; Not Europeans, apparently.  "Screens in our windows?&nbsp; What are those?" Say the Europeans as they swat insects away from their faces.  The British law firm version of a summer associate gig lasts only 2 weeks, and so you spend your summer doing it at several firms.&nbsp; And the offers are tougher to get.  But then again, for the most part, British lawyers only need an undergraduate degree.  The Cure looks like shit, but they sound exactly like they did 20 years ago.  A NYC duo called the 'Scissor Sisters' are fucking huge in Ireland, but I never heard of them in NYC.  The Rapture is also from NYC, and they are amazing live.  British people are into some funny shit, like Judge Dredd comic books and that old Thunderbirds kiddie tv show.  There are vending machines offering Cadbury's chocolate bars at each subway stop in London, but for some reason you don't see any 200 pound 12 year olds here, like you do in the States.  If some change falls out of your pocket in America you usually lose around 37 cents, if that happens to you in England, you're probably out at least 5 bucks.  Blogging is a great way to keep yourself busy when the fascists at your firm have seen it fit to block access to instant messenger, ign.com, seanbaby.com, videogames.com, cruel.com, and every other worthwhile videogame or humor (I mean humour) site on the web.

If you sit in the same seat in every class, especially if it's front row center&nbsp;- &nbsp;you might be a gunner.

If you find that you're the center square in your classmate's version of gunner bingo, well, then you probably are a gunner.

      You've got questions, I've got answers:     Does being a gunner get you anywhere? I know grading is anonymous, right? Can you get the alleged 'bump' from a prof. without being a gunner? Does the bump really exist?      grading is anonymous, right?   Yes, grading is blind,  but  the professors see who scored what after the final, and have the discretion to change grades.&nbsp; So the prof has the option of giving the bump.    Does the bump really exist?   Depends on the professor. Many of the more traditional professors say they will never change a grade, and base the grade 100% on your score on the final, and I don't doubt them.&nbsp; This is probably the most common position, and more older or traditional professors seem to be in this camp - they would think it unfair to bump anyone.  But some say that they will consider class participation&nbsp;and/or attendance&nbsp;when deciding final grades, and a few actually say that class participation counts for x% of the final grade.   Personally, I hate it when they claim class participation counts as a possible grade bump because it has a polarizing effect on the class. Certain gunner types won't shut up and try to speak every chance they can in hopes of their grading bump, while others figure they'll never be among the handful to get such a bump and give up trying to get a word in edgewise.   Assess your professor .  Is he the type that's going to give a bump for class participation?  See how he deals with gunners in class.&nbsp; Does he love the attention and the having a little sycophant lapping at his (or her) balls and rushing up to him after every class with esoteric questions?&nbsp; Or does he find them annoying - do they constantly get him off track and distracted?&nbsp; Also, does he check people off on his seating chart after they comment, or just after he's called on them?&nbsp; Is he into cold calling or does he try to solicit volunteers?  But mostly, just take his word for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;His grading criteria will be&nbsp;on the syllabus or some loud gunner will ask him about it on the first day of class.&nbsp; If he claims that he'll use class participation as criteria, you can be skeptical, because who really knows if he's just saying this to get you to pay attention and come to class, but make a mental note of it.   Can you get the alleged 'bump' from a prof. without being a gunner?   I should think so.&nbsp; Don't think these professors are stupid.&nbsp; Don't forget the most typical type of gunner is the person that is just running his mouth for the sake of the bump, trying to look and sound smart when he really has nothing of substance to say.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think this professor is fooled?&nbsp; Do you think he actually enjoys hearing this little punk run his mouth about&nbsp;a subject&nbsp;that the professor knows a thousand time better?&nbsp;   If you have something intelligent to say, say it.&nbsp; And if you have a worthwhile question to ask, ask it.&nbsp; Especially if you've determined that your teacher is one of the ones that might give the bump out.&nbsp; But don't obsess over the bump.&nbsp; Out of over a hundred students it's very unlikely that you'd be one of the few to benefit from a bump anyway.&nbsp; I can't speak for teachers, but among students there's the common consensus that the &nbsp;student who speaks up every week or so with a consistently intelligent or insightful comment is ten times more impressive than the gunner that speaks as often as humanly possible.  Also, I don't know if negative bumps exist, but they're scary.&nbsp; So if you get called on when you're not in class you should probably offer an excuse for your absence.&nbsp; And if you pass or give a crappy answer when you're called on, be sure to be up on the reading for the next few days in case he goes back to you.&nbsp; And try not to miss a ton of classes if your class is small enough that you think the prof might notice.&nbsp;  And do your homework if you have TA sections - I never spoke in my Reg State (Econ Law) class, but I think that getting check pluses on&nbsp;my TA assignments could have given me a bump.&nbsp;&nbsp; And by all means, speak up every once in a while, make the gunners share the stage.&nbsp; Your professor will be relieved to have some new blood in the conversation for once.&nbsp; (They'll often refuse to call on the same gunners after a while).  Every once in a while, after I make a particularly brilliant point in class, I'll have people coming up to me congratulating me for weeks.&nbsp; When you're not an effusive, pedantic, supercilious&nbsp;gunner, your comments are more memorable and impressive.&nbsp; (Sometimes I also shock the TA's with intelligent comments/papers&nbsp;-&nbsp;if you want to do this also.. well...TA's sit in the back of the class, so&nbsp;go ahead and make&nbsp;the mistake of getting a seat where they can see your computer screen and then proceed to goof off in class and don't take notes the entire semester... they'll be shocked if you know anything at all)

       Reading those 'insider guides' to law firms really opens your eyes to&nbsp;the BigLaw lifestyle.&nbsp; Not that the guides are useful in the least -&nbsp;all the firms sound the same and the information is absolutely contradictory (which is to be expected when you base your data on subjective associate surveys).&nbsp; But what's eyeopening are the&nbsp;statements like this, which is what people say about Winston and Strawn, the firm Vault ranked the  number&nbsp;one&nbsp;best firm to work for&nbsp; :    "The firm culture is very friendly, attorneys on your floor you don't even work with make an effort to say hello in the halls and make small talk."   &nbsp;  &nbsp;So...&nbsp; that's what it takes to be the firm ranked&nbsp;as having the&nbsp;best quality of life in the entire country?&nbsp; Attorneys with the common human decency to say hello when you pass them in the halls?&nbsp; To make small talk when you're in an elevator together?&nbsp; Jesus.&nbsp; If that's what's so special about the firm with the best 'quality of life' I can't imagine working at one of the firms with the worst....&nbsp;  &nbsp;   (...or maybe I can, thanks to this post&nbsp;from   urlLink  Anonymous Lawyer   : " So many of my colleagues are overbearing individuals.&nbsp; They're loud, they're obnoxious, they get their way, and they appear to have absolutely no emotional depth".  &nbsp; {  Interesting.&nbsp; keep that in mind when you read my 'You Might be a Gunner' post tomorrow.})      Anyway, the people at my firm over here are super-friendly.&nbsp; Today they asked me if I wanted to play 'Rounders' with them after work on Thursday.&nbsp; I had no idea what that was, so I figured it was a type of card game, like that poker&nbsp;movie with Matt Damon, but they told me it was just like baseball.&nbsp; I told them that I thought Cricket was what they played instead of baseball over here, but they said that Cricket is very different from baseball, but Rounders is very much like baseball.&nbsp; I dunno, it would probably be a good experience, and I'd probably&nbsp;have fun and end up with a some&nbsp;funny stuff to write about on here, but Thursday's my last day of work, and my friend O-dogg is flying over that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm going to duck out early Thursday and take Friday off so&nbsp;O-dogg and I can hang out in London until Nate-dogg flies over on Sunday, and then we're going to all fly to Amsterdam, a place we're all dying to check out -&nbsp;but only because of its beautiful canals, its Van Gough museum, and the Anne Frank house, of course.&nbsp;    PS.&nbsp; Before I leave I've got to bid on what&nbsp;firms I want to interview with.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm doing my profile on the online site and I have a question - should I select 'Learning Disability' under Disabilities on the profile page?&nbsp; It's right there under speech, hearing, and visual impairment.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I have at least several learning disabilities, and I'm sure my slothful work ethic, inattention to detail, and radical mood swings are exactly what law firms are seeking&nbsp;their quest towards creating a diverse workplace.

       urlLink From  WFSB Channel 3 Eyewitness news, Hartford, CT:    (Hartford) - Eyewitness News has new information on the riot that broke out at the Dave Matthews concert in Hartford last night.  Police used tear gas and sting balls to break up a fight in the Jai Alai parking lot.  Eyewitnesses say people were throwing bottles and rocks at each other.   Twenty-five people were arrested on charges of inciting a riot, assault and breach of peace.  Police say four people are still in jail from fights at the concert.  The scene reminded everyone of another riot at the Meadows five years ago.  People fought, threw objects and burned cars at that Dave Matthews concert.    HA!  I was at that riot they mentioned five years ago.  Damn, has it been that long?   (   Memories...pressed between the pages of my mind........Memories, sweetened thru the ages just like wine)      Man.  Those were good times.  People on the news are always shocked when they see a bunch of high school aged middle-class suburban kids going nuts and rioting.  I think it's hilarious - especially when it happens at a DMB concert - I don't think there could be a wimpier group of fratboy, overcrowded+Fitch hippie-Winnebago out there now that the Grateful Dead are dead.  I especially like how now people can't blame the music, like they can when riots happen at, say, a Rage Against the Machine/Wu-tang Clan concert (that's the only other time I've ever been teargassed*).      I know this from experience: growing up in the suburbs sucks.  It's boring.  I consider myself lucky to have grown up next to a city, even though it was a pretty crappy one.  And NYC was always just a train-ride away.  Going to the outdoor summer concerts at the Meadows in Hartford was always awesome.  Sure, the concerts were good, but the real show was in the vast parking lots where thousands of young people from across the state gathered to tailgate before, after, and even during the shows.  I remember the time when my friend Sam was moving to California, and his parents donated their entire bar to us.  We tossed a couple dozen of bottles into my trunk and ended up as some of the coolest kids in the lot.  There was always a lot of binge drinking at these shows, and they were usually overcapacity with sell-out crowds.  So I understand when the crowd gets rowdy.  I guess overturning cars and setting them on fire is fun, as long as it's not your car.  But I wouldn't consider that crowd violent - they're not beating people up like European football hooligans, and they're not motivated by anger and hatred like a crazy arab at one of those Muslim riots- those are the worst because those lunatics riot  sober** .  Nah, these are just bored kids.      *The other 'riots' I witnessed, besides the RATM and DMB ones, were all at colleges.  One occured after a certain basketball team won the NCAA, one was to protest a draconian alcohol policy (who says my generation isn't politically active?), and one happened after a multi-building party my DJ friend co-ordinated got way too big and the cops attempted to shut it down.      **I do think that drunken-sport-fan-frat-boy-binge drinker-types are most prone to rioting over here.  But I also think you can't just blame it on the alcohol.  I spent my last weekend with thousands of drunken Irish people at a gigantic music festival and there was zero violence, rioting, raping, stealing, as far as I could tell.  There's a reason they can't have any Woodstock festivals in the US anymore, and it's the same reason you can't hitchhike over here - you just can't trust strangers in the US not to be violent thugs anymore.

Thankfully he's doing fine, and now has a great story to tell during EIP interviews.

       Farenheit 9/11 : I finally saw it. And it’s powerful even if you already know all that stuff about Bush and the Saudis, Enron, Haliburton, (and how Fox News, Jeb Bush, Katherine Harris, and the Supreme Court handed Bush the election while Gore and the democrats said nothing). The most powerful part of it, for me, was the very beginning - before the credits, before all the 9/11 and Iraq War material. I was filled with pride watching footage of Bush’s inauguration, where patriotic Americans threw eggs at his limo and helped mother nature rain on and ruin his celebratory parade. Seeing it overseas, that’s the part that made me proudest to be an American, and thankful that the world is getting the chance to see this movie. When they have no images of the huge American opposition to the Bush regime, this is the movie that will show them that at least half of the American people stand with them in their anger and hatred of our as-yet unselected leader. A movie like this can actually make the world less extreme in their violent hatred of our country. I wonder if those of you who haven’t traveled abroad in the last year can really understand how hated we are in the world today? And I’m not talking about being hated by ignorant lunatics in Pakistan, I’m talking about the real world. It’s depressing that foreigners assume that as an American you automatically support your government: the Bush regime; so hopefully this movie can correct that untrue, and dangerous, perception. I like to tell these foreigners that any American that actually has a passport and is traveling abroad like I am is very unlikely to be a Bush supporter. Supporting Bush in this day and age is something that only a rich CEO or some ignorant, Passion&nbsp;VHS pre-ordering, country-bumpkin in a flyover state that doesn’t even have a passport could do - and neither of them is likely to be kickin‘ it in a hostel in Barcelona. And those Americans are likely too fat to fit in Europe anyway. Anyone that respects world opinion and the global reputation of his country just wouldn’t have the stomach to stand behind Bush.  Also, I loved seeing Moore cruelly taunt Bush for his endless vacationing in August 2001. It did a good job reminding us how asleep at the wheel our government was it came to Bin Laden before 9/11. Not that Clinton did much to take on Al-Quaeda either. Hell, if 9/11 hadn’t been so horrible we’d probably still be ignoring the arab threat. So now that this movie’s been a big hit in the states: do the American people know that the Bush regime lied about the connection between Iraq and Al-Quaeda? That all our attention to Iraq has shifted the focus from where it belongs? That it’s actually taking the heat off Al-Quaeda and helping their global recruiting efforts? Do they now recognize that the most dangerous country is none other than our best buddies the Saudis? These people that wouldn’t be our ‘friends’ if they didn’t have the good fortune of sitting atop billions worth of oil? It’s just too bad Bush chose to work on oil pipelines instead of taking care of the real problem of terrorism.    Ladykillers : Actually really good. Nice little dark comedy from my favorite directors, the Coen brothers. It’s not their best, of course, but Tom Hanks was great, and so was the entire ensemble. Here, let me break down the Coen filmography, because it would be too hard to rank it:   Tier 1 : Barton Fink, Miller’s Crossing, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, Blood Simple, The Man Who Wasn’t There   Tier 2 : The Ladykillers, Raising Arizona, O Brother Where Art Thou    The Return : I’m a big fan of Russian movies, so I had to check this one out. And yeah.. It’s what I expected,  fast-paced and cheerful, like all Russian literature and film. (/sarcasm)     Spiderman 2 : Yup, it was good.&nbsp; Nice shots of campus - you could kinda see the law school behind Tobey when he's calling MJ from the pay phone.&nbsp; I still like first 2 X-men/Batmans better. But it’s nice to see this franchise is improving as it continues (like X-Men, unlike Batman). But enough with the comic book movies, already. Unless you’re going to make The Watchmen. Or more great ‘alternative’ comic book movies, like Crumb, Ghost World, or American Splendor.    Thunderbirds : After the realistic adolescents in The Return, it was hard to stomach this piece of shit. Typical PG kids action movie. I expected at least some good CGI and some fun acting from Ben Kingsley, who plays the bad guy. I mean, he was the best villain of all time in Sexy Beast. But he sucked in this. Can he really be that strapped for cash? And I’m not old enough to have any warm, nostalgic feelings about the TV show it’s based on. But I know that show was cool because it was all done with marionette puppets. So why was this movie live action and crappy CGI? If the movie was done with puppets it wouldn’t have been so boring and generic - it would have been cool! Kids love puppets! Stoned college kids love puppets! Everyone loves puppets! The fucking puppets in Dark Crystal were more expressive than the lame cast in this film.  I did like the CGI ‘London Monorail’ that the Thunderbirds rescued people from, it looked so cool crossing the Thames in front of the London Eye that I wished there really was a monorail in London. I think more movies should invent fictional transportation systems for their bad guys to attack. I didn’t like seeing Doc Ock try to kill people on the real NYC subway in Spiderman 2, but seeing Ben Kingsley try to kill people on the made-up monorail was fine by me.    Monster : Really good. Charlize Theron absolutely earned her Oscar. Man, she looked disgusting - at least when Halle Berry went all unhinged in her hardcore sex scenes for her Oscar, she looked good doing it. If two years ago you told me I’d see a move where Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci have lesbian sex and it wouldn’t be sexy or hot at all, I’d have called you a liar and kicked you in the nuts.

        How many hours of sleep do you get each night?  How often do you drink alone?  Do you know anyone here that&nbsp;smokes pot?  If you could trade jobs with your clients, would you?  What's the last movie you've seen?  What's the last book you've read?  What firm do you think requires the least amount of work?  Do you ever fear that you're going to get anthrax poisening when you ride the subway?  Are you not going to hire me because I'm too lazy to join a journal?  Do you get laid more now than you did in school?

      I'm reading Asimov's I, Robot.&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good.&nbsp; Classic 50s Sci-Fi.&nbsp; It's depressing that the movie is supposed to be shit, as it's directed by Alex Proyas, whose Dark City was a sci-fi cult classic masterpiece that, along with dozens of animes and cyberpunk novels,&nbsp;paved the way for&nbsp;The Matrix.&nbsp;&nbsp; Depressing that Harlan Ellison and Isaac Asimov actually wrote their own screenplay for I Robot in the 70s, but of course, the studio wouldn't dare use that.&nbsp; Why can't sci-fi&nbsp;be smart?&nbsp; Why has it been co-opted by the popcorn movie summer event action movie shit?&nbsp; What about the classics - 2001, Blade Runner?&nbsp; Didn't films like Alien and The Matrix prove that you can have a true Sci Fi movie- one&nbsp;that contains the crowd pleasing action, stars,&nbsp;and special effects without dumbing itself down to the lowest common denominator?  &nbsp;  If you're into Cyberpunk/Sci-Fi:  Also read Snow Crash.&nbsp; It's classic.&nbsp; Great novel, that coined the term 'avatar'.&nbsp; Also has some concepts on the internet/metaverse/virtual reality that were way ahead of its time.&nbsp; And some great theories on the similarities between viruses, franchises, languages,&nbsp;and religions.  &nbsp;  And continuing the Sci-Fi dystopia theme, I'm playing the videogame Deus Ex, for PC.&nbsp; Hands down one of the dozen best videogames I've ever played.&nbsp; Open-ended gameplay in a futuristic world where no one can be trusted, and every conspiracy could be true.&nbsp; Shockingly deep and well-written for a video game.&nbsp; You can play through the entire game without killing a single person, but I earned a reputation for being bloodthirsty pretty quickly, as I slaughtered every 'terrorist' I came across, as well as every&nbsp;innocent bystander that got in my way. &nbsp;(I put terrorist in quotes because it looks like the UN body I work for is going to turn out to be the real bad guy and I'm defecting to the terrorist organization).&nbsp; I can't wait to get home and play the sequel, DX: Invisible War, available on PC and Xbox.

      Sometimes, when I'm in the office, I'm absolutely clueless about how to find the research&nbsp;to answer the question that a lawyer has requested I bring him ASAP.&nbsp; Sometimes I don't even understand what they're asking me to do.&nbsp; There were days last semester where I'd be talking to hiring partners at law firm cocktail events, and they'd be explaining what it is they  do  all day and I'd be smiling and nodding, with no clue what bond pricing&nbsp;or&nbsp;whatever they were talking about was.&nbsp; There were days when I first got to school when I saw the caliber of student I was in class with and the intensity of the workload and the complexity of the reading material and I felt lost.&nbsp; Sometimes, I'd be sitting in the back of the room, daydreaming, and suddenly I'd hear my name, and I was being called on, in front of over one hundred fellow students, being asked what makes this case an example of  purposeful availment  but not that case.&nbsp; And I'd sit there, frozen, and my hands would shake as I pushed the button on my microphone.&nbsp; And how did I feel on these occasion??  &nbsp;  Well, I felt like George W. Bush might have felt, as he sat, frozen, for seven minutes,&nbsp;reading My Pet Goat to a group of Florida school children.&nbsp; I felt like Bush feels when he's blinking into the lights in front of a hundred live cameras, and some reporter's asking him all those hard questions that his handlers neglected to&nbsp;give him the answers to.&nbsp; Like Bush, at those moments I'd think:  Shit, what am I doing here!&nbsp; I'm in  way  over my head.&nbsp; I'm just a normal guy.&nbsp; These people I'm surrounded by are the ones that should be dealing with this stuff.&nbsp; I have no idea what I'm doing.&nbsp; I'm just a lazy, laid-back dude.&nbsp; I have ADD!&nbsp; I'm probably dyslexic, as well.&nbsp; My eyes glaze over when they make me read tedious, esoteric texts!&nbsp; I never set out to have this responsibility! &nbsp;  What am I doing here??     &nbsp;  But then I realize - wait a minute!&nbsp;  I  deserve to be here.&nbsp; Unlike Dubya, I earned  my  position.&nbsp; I didn't get to where I am because of my daddy or my last name.&nbsp; Hell, when Bush was my age he was already&nbsp;a raging alcoholic and cokehead, unlike me&nbsp;- and I don't have any rich, corporate friends that owe  me  any favors!&nbsp; And,  hey , if I mess up from time to time, at least I'm not dragging the entire country... no, the&nbsp;entire  planet  down with me.&nbsp; At least my mistakes don't&nbsp;cost people their lives.&nbsp; At least&nbsp; I'm  not the most hated person on the face of the Earth.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And then I relax, and I do my memo, shoot the (bull)shit with the hiring partner, and try to answer the questions.&nbsp; And if I don't know the answer, I just say "I don't know" and that's a much better thing to do than to just fake it, and muddle through in ignorance, and get it completely wrong, like  that other guy would do.

       Google :  Both this blog and my email (gmail) are powered by google. I like google. But I think it's funny how they try to tailor the ads on the emails and blogs to the contents of the text. Like I'm reading a lawblog bitch about how wearing suits every day is sucky and soul-crushing and the ad's for Mens Wearhouse. Gmail will work this way as well- which is cool if my friend's telling me about Halo 2 and they link me to strategy guides but bad if he's telling me his sister was killed by a drunk driver and they link me to WhiskeyWorld or AutoZone.com.    Bidding on Law Firms :  Next week is the deadline for bidding on which firms we want to interview with for OCI. So I made my list this week. All the firms sound the same in the guides (long hours, bonuses aren't enough, did I mention the long hours) so I just chose based on location, 'prestige' ranking, and if they had a billable hours requirement. I chose a lot of the typical BigLaw NYC suspects, and a few smaller ones in Philly, Boston, etc. No California though, I wish I was from Cali, but I'm not, and I can't see moving all the way there. I also didn't choose any London firms. Anyway, I'm more interested in quality of life than huge bonuses, so I'm not worried about not getting offers from the biggest, baddest 'top' firms - which is why I'm not doing a journal or worrying about my grades in the first place.    Reviews    British Chowder : C-  As someone from  new  England, I know my chowda, and I expected something more from the Sweetcorn and Spring Onion Chowder I had at lunch today. How to describe it? Oh yeah - kernels of corn floating in tepid dishwater. Not chowdery in the least.    And on the subject of 'sweetcorn' :  'Sweetcorn' is what British people call 'corn', and they put it in all their sandwiches.  Loose kernels of corn do not belong in sandwiches!  Gross. Even at Subways here you can put room temperature corn on your sub.   And speaking of Subways in London - which I like to go to because it's one of the few places in London where you can get a sub, and not a  pre-packaged  sandwich for lunch - the Subway 'restaurant' in London is hilariously stingy with portions. Every time you order a tuna salad (tuna mayo that is - 'salad' in the UK salad means lettuce) they use this dingy little ice cream scoop and measure out two precise little scoops of tuna. I know this isn't super-sized America, and I've seen more giant-assed fat ladies on one West Philly bus than I've seen my entire summer here, but come on. One time this dude asked for a more reasonable amount of tuna on his sub and the sandwich artist actually refused him! I congratulate that clerk for not bending the rules, like a lesser employee - an employee that wasn't so scrupulous about saving tuna because he's getting paid the same £5 an hour either way - would have done. And I've never seen a more pathetic response for my 'green peppers' request. But, boy, do they give you mayo....   And here's more general advice when you're ordering. Keep it simple. Clerks don't like to think too hard, and they're not very good at it. I used to communicate what I wanted on my subway by saying 'everything except tomatoes and olives'. That is no good - they hear the magic words TOMATOES and OLIVES and that is what you will get. Also, sometimes they cannot believe that a person would not want yummy tomatoes on his subway, the freak. I guess everyone but me asks for them. You have to make sure they don't put tomatoes on your sub from force of habit. So I order this way, but you can't say it all at once, you have to say each part when the sandwich artist is hovering over that part of the bar: "Can I get Lettuce..... Onions..... NO Tomatoes..... Green Peppers (or  lots of green peppers , if you're in London)...... Pickles*...... and Cucumbers*). Then, if you want a sauce, make sure you say you only want  a little  (for example  "a bit of Mayo, please" ) so they don't drench the motherfucker. And don't let them put salt and pepper on your sub. That's just stupid.   *Am I the only person who thinks it's weird to have both cucumbers and pickles in the same sandwich? They're both the same vegetable, but the pickles are like zombies, and I think the cucumbers must freak out when they see the pickles. It's like - "holy shit, what happened to you"?!  "Well, I was pickled."

      I swear I'm going to write something about Bidding on Law Firms, or London or Dublin, but first let me get this off my chest, cuz I was watching the news on the BBC this morning::::  Watching Tony Blair's address to the house of commons in the wake of the Butler Report is an eye-opener.  I think that 3+ years of Dubya really make you forget what a real leader looks like, and when you see it it's jarring.  Even if you don't agree with Blair's support of the war, you have to respect him, unlike Bush, who doesn't deserve or command an ounce of respect.  Blair's cool.  He's got the force and charm of Clinton with the tough-guy approach of Bush.  Blair can speak, he's convincing, and direct, and holds himself accountable for the actions of his administration.  Do we not deserve a president that can speak, that is capable of putting a complete sentence together (and thinking on his feet without his handlers telling him - word for word - what to say)?  Blair accepts that the intel was bad, but is able to argue, almost convincingly*, that taking Saddam out was still the right move, and he  takes responsibility for his actions .  Why don't we in American deserve a president who will apologize and own up to his mistakes, who will accept that the  buck stops with him ?  I'm getting sick just imagining what the same speech would sound like coming from our disgraceful, simple-minded, dyslexic, un-elected excuse for a president.  It would probably use the word 'evildoer' a few times, and then he'd probably change the subject and try to get us worked up about those damned Activist Judges letting faggots marry and not letting our kids pray in their own schools.  *I'm not convinced that taking out Saddam has made the world safer because the war was one giant recruiting effort for Al-Quaeda.  As soon as the videotapes of boys being sodomized at Abu Ghraib come out there is no chance we're not going to be subjected to hundreds more terrorist attempts.  So, this is working just like the tremendous failure that is the war on drugs - we're going after the effects and not the causes.  And it's working like missile defense, in that maybe we can stop half the attacks, maybe 90% of them, but we're not going to stop them all, and these attacks are going to be huge.  Nothing like millions of pissed-off religious fanatics with millions of dollars worth of oil money to get the best black market WMDs money can buy.

      Pretty sick of the hype over law review. Yesterday an email was sent out to the whole school listing everyone that got on Law Review. So, first, I'm happy to note that only one of the dirty half-dozen gunners I hate got on law review, and it was one of the minor ones. Now, we don't know that these other gunners applied and weren't accepted, but I bet they did, since they are gunners, after all, so I like to think they're crushed and suicidal. And a lot of my friends got on. That's bad in the sense that I'll never see them again, but also because now people are emailing me asking how I feel that my friends got on and I didn't. And that pisses me off because they assume I was dying to be on law review like they secretly were, and I didn't apply to Law Review - or any journals at all!   Maybe at other schools they just tap you for law review based soley on your grades, but at Columbia, you gotta apply. There's a weeklong 'writing competition,' that takes place immediately after your final final, when you're ready to hit the beach. So I didn't do it because (1) I couldn't bring myself to spend more than a few hours even getting started on the damn thing, (2) I don't want to be on a journal anyway, (3) I didn't think I'd get on Law Review, (4) if I didn't get on Law Review then I didn't want to join some other journal - why do all the same work and not even get the prestige, which is really your only reward for it?   What's the criteria for making law review at Columbia, you ask? A variety: some are selected based only on the quality of their writing competition, most are selected based on some combination of both writing competition and grades, and, finally, if you're offended by all that meritocracy, you can get onto law review by having diversity (wink, wink), which you write about in a separate essay. So if you're cynical like me you look at the list and guess who got on by having the grades, who got on by being a good writer, and, the easiest guess, unfair as it may be, who got on by being diverse. You can also play this game in your office, college, and law school! Isn't affirmative action great - it's turning us all into racial profilers who wonder if their doctor/lawyer/dentist/pilot got his degree on merit or not!   So yeah, I'm an average student, too lazy to write a good application, and I'm not diverse (in their sense of the word - but in countless other ways); so I wasn't about to spend a week doing the competition and writing essays when I figured I wouldn't made law review anyway. My grades are pretty average, and I know that there are people out there that spend the entire week on the competition - how would I possibly do better than them?   But maybe I could have made it on - A sizeable number of people end up on Law Review, I counted 42 names in the email, and that's probably about 12% of the class. But that doesn't mean that only 12% get on, since we don't know how many people actually do the writing competition. I bet that 75% of the class picks it up, but 50% of the class finishes it. That means that %24 of the entrants get the invite, about a quarter. But we're forgetting that many other good journals at Columbia, like the Journal of Business Law, offer 'early action' applications, where you can apply with a writing sample, transcript, and interview, and if you get accepted then you're bound to join and don't do the writing competition and don't have your shot at Law Review. Lets say that there are a dozen journals that do this, and each takes 5 members that way, a very conservative estimate. That knocks another 50+ people out of the writing competition..   So I figure that about a third of those who enter the writing competition get the LR invite. So assuming that I'm slightly above the middle of the class gradewise, I think I had a decent shot at LR, but in the end I just couldn't be arsed. &nbsp; *It makes sense that the bloggers at Serious Law Student and Three Years of Hell are doing law review.&nbsp; I mean, if you want/expect&nbsp;your three years of law school to be hell, then you definitely should join law review.&nbsp; And if you consider yourself a 'serious' law student, well, then you should probably join law review as well.&nbsp; I'm the lazy law student.

      Greetings to my readers in the increasingly fascist and totalitarian (not to mention globally despised!) United Corporations of America.  It looks like our hard-working, God-fearing Senate is going to vote today on that new Constitutional Amendment* to keep those faggots from getting married like normal, decent Americans.  (Better they have promiscuous sex in public toilets, I guess.)  (Hey - Republicans like Rush Limbaugh value marriage so much they have get more than one!)  It's good to see the Bush administration correcting another of the Constitutions many flaws.  Hopefully, they can just get rid of the whole fucking thing someday - I only wish they'd have done it sooner, since I already had to suffer through Constitutional Law.  Oh well, looks like that part of my education is already getting obsolete.    If you want to call your Senators and congratulate them on playing along with Karl Rove's ingenious ploy to get the poor, uneducated, ignorant, bible-belt heartland worked up in dogmatic Republican support over a non-issue and distract them from Bush's disastrous war in Iraq, and his screw-the-working-man policies, you can reach them at 1-202-225-3121. ------------------------------------------------------ Also in the news: (To show I'm not some liberal pussy) - I think it's dangerous, pathetic, wimpy, and disgraceful that "the Philippines said on Monday it would withdraw its troops from Iraq as soon as possible to save a Filipino hostage threatened with death by militants."  Unbelievable.  Every true country hates us, and our few 'allies' are pussies that we had to bribe, and don't give a shit about us.  An Australian surfer was eaten by Great White sharks.  Yes, tragic, I know.  But I'm glad they  urlLink haven't been able  to find and kill the 'culprits' like they wanted to.  I mean, besides the fact that Great White's are an endangered species, unlike Australians - (hey, an Australian also happens to control our TV 'news' propaganda, thanks to sneaky right-wing billionaire Rupert Murdoch's Fox News).  Plus, sharks aren't even that dangerous.  I don't think a Great Whites have even killed as many people as the rock group Great White did.  I mean, all sports (save bowling and badminton) involve fatal risks.  Every time a skier breaks his neck by plowing into a pine tree at 80 mph we don't rush over and chop the fucking thing down.  And in NYC/England/CrackWhore news: "New Yorkers could soon be stepping out for an 'English' instead of a Chinese or Italian - thanks to Christina Aguilera. The singer has fallen in love with English food and plans to open a restaurant in the Big Apple's SoHo district.  A friend of the 23-year-old singer said: 'Christina loves traditional Sunday roasts and fish and chips.'" -AWESOME!   And finally: An  urlLink article  about Maria Sharapova's bikini  with no pictures .  WTF?  ---------------------------------- *On the subject of the Constitutional amendment, if you'd like to learn more about religious stupidity fighting progress throughout history, you should pick up  Freethinkers: A History Of American Secularism , by Susan Jacoby, which argues, according to the Onion's AV club review, that "hostility toward religion is a vital part of the American heritage. Organized religion, in one or another of its Catholic, Protestant, and evangelical forms, has opposed just about every advance in freedom and equality Americans have achieved since the country's founding: an intentionally God-free Constitution, the abolition of slavery, and civil rights for blacks, as well as women's suffrage, reproductive freedom, and economic equity."  Sounds about right to me - Add stem cells and gay marriage to that list!  But hey, maybe Bush is right about turning the country into a theocracy - maybe we should be more like his Saudi Arabian buddies - women drivers suck, and science goes against God.

      Here's a comment my last post got:  so none of these "gunners" are cool at all? none of them like cool shit like you (i.e. music, video games, curb your enthusiasm?)   Let me address the 'gunner' topic a little more.  Like I said, it's something I don't like to talk about, it was the reason I never wrote about my 1L year while I was a 1L, but I brought it up, so I ought to at least dedicate a post to the topic.  I'm going to answer this for now in a quick post, because I have a ton of work to do here.  I have to go through a million binders of correspondence, trusts, and wills tearing out all references to this dude's ex-girlfriend and I have to finish it today because I'm taking tomorrow off to fly to Dublin to camp out at the  urlLink oxegen festival .  So here's my answer - Yes, there are 'cool' gunners.  There are gunners that I met early on in law school that were into cartoon network and video games and indie music and comedy clubs and bars and parties and whatever, but as soon as they got into the classroom, they ran to the very front row center and spent the entire semester throwing in their 2 cents so many times that if I had a nickel every time they threw in their 2 cents I'd have a thousand nickels.  And they'd have secret study groups, and ask misleading questions in review sessions and hog office hours and bring in outside reading and generally monopolize everyone's time and be supercilious and aggressive and pedantic and annoying while doing it and on and on.  In the future I'll post my list of all the types of gunners, try to define what people mean when they say gunners, tell you about my Oxegen festival experience, and my experience bidding on firms for on-campus interviews in August!  But for now, here's my experience with a 'cool gunner'.    'Cool' gunners can be ok, I'm friends with two of them, and I'll write about that later (for now, just know that I tolerate nice gunners, but not the aggressive, competitive, a-hole gunners).  But 'cool' gunners can be the worst of the bunch, because if they're what we'd consider cool then often their gunner tendencies don't stem from bookishness, or nerdiness, or social cluelessness, or a genuine interest in going above and beyond the scholastic call of duty, but instead from egotism and competitiveness, and a desire to make others feel ignorant, and inferior: 'despair, ye who witness my immense knowledge'.  But here's my story of a 'cool' gunner that's just neurotic.  And a brown-noser (maybe she just had a crush on all her profs?).    She and I met early on during orientation, and she quickly announced that we had so much in common we were obviously going to be best friends throughout law school.  And we did.  But what happened is that about a week into school she transformed into a horrid gunner.  Sure she was brown-nosing every professor, and making endless comments in class, and memorizing the blue book, and doing all that gunner stuff.  But that's not the reason we stopped being friends.  Why?  She was never able to leave the library.  It was unbelievable.  One week into the semester she stopped going out on Thursdays, two weeks in she stopped going out on Fridays, and after that she didn't go out, ever, for the entire semester.  She never went to concerts, clubs, or movies with us.  She wasn't there when our class was at 'bar reviews', getting to know other members of the class, or going to mixers with the Business School, the School of Public Policy, Journalism, Teachers College, etc.  When we had our Halloween party with Fordham, NYU, and St. Johns she wasn't there to meet other 1Ls and make friends and network - she had to get up at 8am the next day to go over her legal writing memo - I mean, she got a check, but why wasn't it a check plus??  When the second semester rolled around, the rest of the class dressed up and went to firm events at fancy NYC bars and restaurants.  We'd talk with eachother, eat hors d'oerves off of silver trays, order scotches, beers, wines, and gin and tonics at open bars, and schmooze with lawyers at all the firms that wanted us to bid on them for our 2L summer job.  Where was she when we were getting drunk on BigLaw's dime?  Learning about the professional world, collecting business cards, practicing networking the cocktail party way?  Well, she was in the library.  How come they always do these things on weekdays anyway?  I can't go have drinks at 7pm on a Wednesday!  Etc Etc Etc Etc.  This girl was just one example of a type of gunner, because she was the 'cool' one you're asking about.  Cool's a relative term, but she was, to me, the worst kind, because she had these interests, and this creativity, and she was funny, and fun, but, to me, she wasted her 1L experience.  She isn't nearly as hated as other gunners - because she could get away with it.  She was attractive, and cool, and didn't run to the professor immediately after class every day, and didn't wheel a bag to class, and was able to disguise her constant studying by going to other libraries.  But it was the saddest for me.  Law school, and BigLaw especially, is a haven for that type of pathologically driven person.  It's depressing, and it never ends.  You work all through high school to go to the best college then it's the best law school then it's the journal, then it's editor of the journal, then it's the best clerkship, then it's the best firm job, then it's the best assignments, then it's the partnership... and on and on and on til you finally have a breakdown and get committed or have a heart attack and die.

      My job this week has pretty much entailed endless online research and article sorting.  So since I'm online so much I've been writing a lot in my new 'blog', and browsing other law school 'blogs'.  First, a lot of them aren't anonymous.  I don't get that.  I mean, I don't think I'd feel comfortable knowing that any person I work with, interview with, sit in class next to, or call 'mommy' or 'daddy', could just type my name into google and read this crap.  But then again, that's because I approach blogging differently than they do.  They talk about Supreme Court decisions and who John Kerry will pick as a running mate (Edwards! He should be a good choice to take on Dr. Evil in the debates!).  I talk about getting hassled by bums and hot florists, and what I had for lunch.  So, they're professional, and I talk about video games and call things 'faggy'.  But I don't go overboard with that anonymous crap - I mean, I let you know I go to the finest law school in Bogota, didn't I?  There's a reason I didn't start doing this online journal thing when I was a 1L.  Firstly, because ever since 'One L' it's been a cliche to write about your own histrionic 1L experience, like it's a big deal.  And, well, mostly because I wasn't as bored - it took an office summer job to get me into blogging.  During my 1L year there was a lot of stuff I was doing- clubs, activities, lectures, and meeting new people and partying and even going to class.  But also I was reluctant because I knew my journal would have been totally negative - since the minority of gunners at law school (and they are a minority, just a very toolish and vocal one - like the religious right) were seriously bumming me out.  I had a handful of the most awful gunners in my section first semester.  There were weeks when the same three people would talk in every single one of our classes every day.  So I just wrote sarcastic haikus and commiserated via IM with my peers.  But after the first few weeks you know to ignore the few psychopath type-A gunners, and you find your own group of friends, and you figure out that there's no need to stress over academics, especially if you have the luxury of attending a 'top' school.  Advice to 1Ls-to-be: don't be a gunner.  There is no excuse.  You will be hated with a fury usually reserved for terrorists and telemarketers.  Be the quiet kid that comments occasionally, but hits the nail on the head when he does.  That's much more impressive.  So the only blogs I can stand reading are usually the ones that just talk about the person's life.  And then it either has to be somebody I know (in  real life  - you don't  know  someone just because you read their online journal, geek) or they have to be really funny or interesting, like  urlLink jeremy blachman  or the  urlLink diary of a stand-up comedian )  So I added links to other bloggers from my school, and I'll add more when I find them.  But know that I don't endorse them, and probably won't be reading them very often.  They're either dull, serious, pedantic, or just plain boring.  And that tells you more than you need to know about your typical law student.  Final Though: The worst law school blogs are written by those that haven't even started law school yet.  Here's what they are planning to accomplish over their pre-1L summer: - read cases!  practice briefing cases! - read some outlines!  practice outlining! - take a law school prep course!  get a head start on my peers! - go to gym every day, get in shape - gotta have that stamina for 1L year!  - research law firms! - prepare cover letters and resume for mailing on December 1st! - research professors and courses! - see what clubs and journals I want to join!  Here's what I planned to accomplish over my pre-1L summer: - beat Zelda: The Wind Waker (and I didn't even do that - finding those pieces of the triforce was a fucking bitch of a chore)

      I'm a gifted rapper.  That is to say.. I can rap along to pretty much any rap song I've heard at least a dozen times, and even if I don't, I generally know enough of the lyrics to fake it pretty well when the song's playing in the club.  That's why I like to dance to hip hop, as opposed to the typical House music they play in Europe.  Cuz, if you're cuttin' a rug with some fit slag (or even a minger if you're drunk enough) you can show off by rapping along, and that gives you something to do when you're facing each other and don't know what kind of expression you should make, and it takes the attention away from your whiteboy dance moves.    Plus, it lets you say the kind of shit to some hot stranger you could never say otherwise.  For example, I said this to that hot summer intern at the party:   ...pretty young thing, go around my dick with your tongue ring.. ...we'll be fucking all night like we was on E... ...I'm into having sex I aint into making love...    So I was impressing a few of these charmingly ignorant Brits by knowing these rap songs they were playing in the cool back room of Fabric.  Ok, one thing bugs me - some of the records this guy was spinning were the clean versions of the songs.  I fucking hate that clean version shit.  I only rap the dirty version, and sometimes it's like a whole different fucking song.  I can only imagine some one listening on in confusion:  That kid knows a lot of the words to those rap songs, but why is changing the words?  Why does he have to keep throwing in the F word?  and B word, and even the *gasp* N word???  What a freak!

      More problems with bums.  I was sitting on a bench using my laptop - because I was able to hijack some wireless internet at this specific spot and avoid paying £1 an hour at some cyber cafe.  Of course this means that every 10 minutes some dude's going to come ask me for money.  But I accept that as the inevitable downside, as the price I have to pay for being cheap and not just going to a cyber cafe.  So one scary looking dude asks for money, and I politely turn him down.  Then his friend, even dirtier and scarier looking, runs over and squats down in front of me - looking into my eyes - putting his head so close to mine that I can imagine his head lice jumping ship to the more fertile, virgin plains of my scalp.  Here comes the sermon.  He begins - totally indignant... appalled.  "Mate" he begins, "We - we live  on the street !  We jus' need change for a hostel, to spend the night, mate!"  "I'm sorry, I don't have any change."  Which was true.   (It's probably ironic, but I've been waiting so long for my paycheck from work to clear, and for my crappy British bank to give me my PIN number, that I'm totally out of money.  Couldn't even afford to see Fahrenheit 9/11, which opened that day, the fourth of July. And all I had to eat today - since I had no money - was one Big Mac - because the day before I got two for the price of one - part of Mickey D's weekend evening promotion.  Have you ever had to eat a Big Mac that's spent a night in a fridge and 30 seconds in a microwave?  So yeah, I didn't have any money at all.)   He turns, in disgust, but he's not giving up, just yet.  "And you have a laptop."  "Yeah, but I don't have any change for you.  Sorry."  "Sorry? What are you sorry about?"  "THAT I'M NOT GIVING YOU ANY FUCKING MONEY; IF I HAD CHANGE TO SPARE I'D BE USING IT AT A CYBER CAFE SO I COULD SIT AND EMAIL IN FUCKING PEACE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT HAVING MY FUCKING LAPTOP STOLEN AT KNIFEPOINT."  The dude took off.  It makes me feel good to know that I can intimidate scary drunken British hobos.  Besides, I was hungover from saturday night at Fabric, so I probably looked like I stole the laptop anyway.   (reminds me of something I once read at samgreenspan.com: "The bums really need to stop harassing me. Seriously, guys, I'm not currently in the fiduciary standing to contribute to you. I do feel sympathy, but if not for wonderful, generous parents I'd be standing side-by-side with you right now. Hey, to keep warm, we could use my pricey but useless college degree for kindling!")   Another thing - Why do people think that it's socially acceptable to go up to complete strangers and ask for cigarettes?  If you see someone eating some delicious looking french fries you wouldn't just run up and ask if you could grab a few, right?  So why do people ask me to give them cigarettes?  Next they're going to want a sip of my coffee, a bite of my bagel, a kiss on the cheek.  At least here in London it's always good for a cheap laugh: "Pardon, mate, can I bum a fag?" Scuse me? "Mind if I bum a fag?" Nah man, suit yourself.  Good luck. I will never stop smiling when I hear that.  Final note(s): The most beautiful girl in London works at a roadside flower stand on Tottinham Court Road, and I walk by her every day on the way to work.  This is what I would do if I was another type of guy - walk up to her, buy a flower, and  give it to her!   How clutch would that be?  Lame?  Well, I'd never do it, in a million years.  Speaking of hot chicks and the guys that approach them.  Near this flower place on the same main drag, there's a Scientology headquarters/recruitment center.  They're always offering free personality/stress/iq tests or whatever weird shit will get the loonies to come in and listen to their stories about engrams and volcanoes and whatever else their sci-fi cult/religion believes in.  Well, I've always wanted to take them up on their offer, and see how exactly they hope to hook you into the exciting world of Scientology, where you'll dine with Travolta, Cruise, and the now 300+ pound Kirstie Alley.  Anyway, today I really wanted to drop in because they had two young, cute girls giving out the Dianetics flyers!  What's up with that?  I watched 'em for a bit, and it was really interesting to see how much more effective hot chicks are at marketing than the usual scary loners and sullen immigrants that give out coupons and flyers and shit in London.  People actually took the flyers from them and read them.  'Well, this must be legitimate and important', they probably thought, 'a hot girl gave this to me after all.'  Best was the big black fireman who took a flyer from one of them.  "Does this have your phone number on it?"  That's the kind of shit I wish I could say.  "No, but it has  a  phone number on it." The Scientolobitch replied.  It would be funny if that guy's sex drive got him into Scientology, though.  Hell, maybe joining a cult is a good way to meet hot chicks.  As long as it's not some lame celebate cult (like Southern Baptists -  I keed I keed! ) or some cult where only the cult leader gets to fuck everybody - like the Branch Davidians.  Or some cult where you have to chop your nuts off, like those Hale Bopp motherfuckers.

      Saw two movies on Saturday.  Shrek 2, which was decent, but not nearly as great as people seem to think - like the first.  The best stuff were the little gags, the subtle little touches.  Can Cameron Diaz and Mike Myers really be worth $20 million each just to voice the leads?  Mike Myers is fine as Shrek, I guess, but I just don’t like that character - I mean, I understand it… yeah.. He’s a cranky mean ogre, but the Scottish accent’s annoying, and not hilarious like his Scottish dad from So I Married and Axe Murderer (‘he’ll cry himself to sleep.. On his GIANT PILLA’).  Nah, Mike Myers fell off.. Soon he’ll be another fading comic genius, doing more kiddy shit like Cat in the Hat (Like Eddy Murphy.. But more on him later).  And Diaz.  She ain’t worth the money.  Seriously.  Sure, she’s worth the money in Charlies Angles or something where she shakes her ass… but a fucking cartoon where she plays a green ogress?  Is her voice worth $20 million?  What about in foreign markets (unlike English-speaking markets.. Like here in the UK, I mean).  Then it’s like she’s not even in the damn movie…  and yet they still fly her over to Tokyo to promote it!  That’s fucking weird.    As usual, the only funny characters in this are the secondary ones - Eddie Murphy’s donkey, Antonio Bandaras’ Puss in Boots, Brit Jennifer Saunders’ Fairy Godmother (doing a hilarious take on the whole Disneyish way of cramming Prince-Charming/pink gown/talking furniture shit down little girls’ throats).. Oh, and cool, gay Brit Rupert Everett as the sissy vain Prince Charming.  So, while Shrek and Ms. Shrek are dull characters that bored me to tears (and John Cleese wasn’t really given a chance to do anything worthwhile as Fiona’s King dad), Eddie Murphy continues to be just amazing as the voice of the Donkey.  Like I said - It’s odd that he hasn’t been able to play any good adult comedy roles in so long, but he just kills in the cartoon - the combination of his voice and the funny looking CGI donkey is just magic.  He’s worth every penny.  Oh, and so was Ellen Degeneres in Finding Nemo.  Put more stand-up geniuses into cartoons!  Oh yeah… There going to make Shrek 3 and 4...  Great…  Well, I’ll have to see it for Eddie Murphey, and the great animation.  But - final thought - Shrek - it’s just not as cynical and anti-Disney, and post-modern as it claims to be.  It’s way too much like the Disney or Pixar family fare it claims to skewer.  What did I see after that?  Oh yeah, Tupac Ressurection, the ‘documentary‘ on 2pac.  The whole time it just made me wish I was watching that 'Kurt and Courtney' Brit guy's documentary ‘Biggie and Tupac’, which I can imagine is far superior only because it isn’t so fucking tame and whitewashed.  This was really just a big love letter to 2pac.  Nothing hard-hitting about anything.  I mean, the damn thing was made by MTV and endorsed by his mom (no wonder the film glossed over her crack fiend period).  I mean, I’m one of 2pacs biggest fans, but , come on…  everything in the film presented 2pac in the best light possible.  It was really almost dishonest.  Like every sexual assault charge that locked him up was just some conspiracy by the Man or just some overzealous fan.  Like his whole beef with Biggie and Shug, that led to his death (?) was barely even broached or investigated.  Like his entire Thug Life philosophy was presented as a 100% positive message.  I dunno, I really really like 2pac,  but part of what makes him great is his incredible complexity, and this film just boiled him down to some sort of saint that he never was.  And he was complex, idolizing black women like his moms while dissin’ the rest, his whole peace v. violence thing.. his underground cred v. mainstream sucess (a movie with Janet Jackson!), his privileged educated artistic/political/poet upbringin versus his adopted ghetto lifestyle.  (The most interesting clip shows him and School of the Arts classmate Jada Pinkett (now Smith) doing a karaoke video to Will Smith’s Parent’s just don’t understand… first, it’s funny he was friends with Jada, but think they had any idea she’d be married to Will Smith 15 years later? Of course this wasn't mentioned by the documentary).  The best parts of the film were just clips of Pac performing, early on with Digital Underground, later on with Outlawz, doing his bloodthirsty revenge call to arms this is war masterpiece ‘Hit Em Up’, etc.  And seeing him being interviewed by Tabitha Soren, talking about getting beat by cops, going to jail, etc… just so charming and funny.  But, except for showing him during his ego phase, being an asshole in interviews, braggin about beating up the Huges Bros.  This was a pretty lame doc.     Then I went to Fabric.  Cool club.  Sexy crowd.  Stayed til 5.  Walked home.  Slept all Sunday.

      Man, I'm buzzed.  I just had my first true fancy 2 hour lawyer lunch.  The American practice group went out to an American restaurant for drinks, burgers, drinks, and drinks to celebrate the 4th of July.  It's 3:30pm, I just got back, and I just want to crawl under my desk and take a nap.  So, I was feelin' a bit tipsy, when the check came I threw in my card - thankfully the attorneys threw it back at me.. saved me about a hundred bucks.  I sat next to the guy that I wrote a memo for yesterday.  I was feeling pretty shy since I was sure that the memo was so bad it made the shit I wrote last year in legal writing actually look good, but he didn't say anything about it.  We actually talked about Xbox games.  word.

      Wow - a cgi comedy show  urlLink based on the lives of Siegfried & Roy's lions ! Sounds like a great idea, except that Roy was horribly maimed by one of his animals and their act is finished. I know that the network probably developed this show before the accident, but still... they've had enough time to change the premise. I can't believe they're going through with it. This should be the most morbid sitcom since that '8 Simple Rules' show that kept on after John Ritter's sudden death. Talk about Must See TV!

      The story of  urlLink K.A.D. Camara , (from  urlLink JD2B ). Last June, at age 19, he earned his doctorate in law magna cum laude, making him possibly the  urlLink youngest graduate in Harvard Law School history:    urlLink  There are few people who are as well known or as widely disliked here at Harvard Law than third year student K.A.D. Camara, also known as Kiwi. The reason for this is that in his class notes and course outlines, he uses the abbreviations "nig" and "nigs" to stand for African Americans. For instance, in writing about Shelly v. Kraemer, Camara writes: "Nigs buy land with no nig covenant; Q: Enforceable?"     Yeah..he actually posted that outline to the shared database! What an arrogant, racist, stupid son of a bitch! I love it - you're doing Harvard proud K.A.D! (People like that cad = another reason I'm a proud Columbian....And I'm proud that you're not a white boy - you're a racist Filipino immigrant! How funny! {and a ballroom dancer!})  So he didn't get an offer from his firm. I'm going to mention this guy the next time people ask me for examples in support of my theory that true gunners are often so arrogant, offensive, grating and almost Aspergerian in their cluelessness that, in spite of any impressive academic credentials they, like K.A.D., may possess, they're simply unemployable. They're impossible to work with; they don't fit in the real world socially or culturally; they will alienate all their co-workers and scare away clients! They are hated! (Although K.A.D. got a clerkship and will probably end up in academia or on the bench....unbelievable...)  Another example: a friend of mine who is doing his BigLaw associate thing this summer just told me about one of his fellow summers who was just fired. A particularly important client was giving some sort of presentation on diversity or something, and this pedantic, arrogant little gunner decides to speak up and went off on the poor guy with an endless anti-affirmative-action tirade while partners held their heads in awkward shame. Now, I'd probably agree with the substance of this loudmouth rightwinger's anti-AA screed, and it's not like the substance of his tirade was racist, but seriously -  have some fucking tact! You deserved to get fired because  you can't act like a gunner in the real world!  Back in school you're allowed to stand up and force your loudmouthed, know-it-all opinion on the entire room - but you can't do it in front of the CLIENT and the entire office, you douche! You're a lowly summer - you can't continue to be a self-important, pedantic, supercilious, know-it-all little shit anymore!     PS: K.A.D.'s story also reminded me of an experience I had last semester, working on a collaborative outline with a study group for my Perspectives on Legal Thought (Legal Philsophy) class. As per usual, I had missed the first meeting of our group, so they assigned me the absolute worst topics: I, the only white boy in the group, had to prepare the section covering Critical Race Theory and Feminist Legal Theory. I mean, that stuff is pretty retarded - these are serious academics who basically argue shit like 'all sex is rape' or 'white people are spawns of satan', so I made my outline pretty hilarious, openly mocking all of the pieces I was covering. I feared my group would be displeased, but they ended up loving it. Score!

      I just found out about  urlLink Fuck the Vote  thanks to  urlLink Three Years of Hell , and I'm intrigued. Since I (like Anthony) live in the solid blue state of New York and (unlike Anthony) plan to vote for Kerry anyway, I don't think anyone would care enough about my vote to fuck me for it. But I'm willing to throw my useless NY vote to that asshole Nader for the right price...(it would take no less than a Maria Sharapova/Jessica Alba threeway to get me to vote for Dubya). And I'd probably be willing to whore myself out to a hot, female Republican (an unlikely combination, I know) in exchange for her pledge not to vote for Chimpy. But it sounds like a bad idea. Not just because it's illegal, but because fucking dirty green-party hippie-whores or frumpy, repressed republican sluts can't be good.

       Hello Ava, you have one new email message:       Dear People,  Rumour has it, it’s going to be a scorcher on Sunday. So I have an idea… and I blame my mums hippie influences on me.  What better thing to do than sit on Primrose Hill and get battered from about 3pm, then maybe trundle into Camden or along to Sensible Sunday later on for a Sunday Lunch.  Consider yourself cordially invited. Bring salty snacks, sweets, strawberries, sound systems loaded with tunes, and of course, some alcoholic beverages of your choosing. Swap books. Swap ideas. Swap saliva. Bands bring guitars and treat us to some songs.  If you feel like being nerdy, the password is “This is not a flashmob”. Forward this to your friends and let’s get some community going on in the London indie scene. You’ll be able to spot our crowd by their pasty complexions and drunk’n’disorderly attitude at such an hour on a Sunday.  See you there?  Sean

Dear Talking Gunner, I don't have time to listen , but still you prattle.  Silly girl in front , Why do you keep talking so? Please be quiet now.  Instant messenger makes class time tolerable. Why pay attention?  Another day ends at Columbia Law School. Time to smoke some crack.  What's more addictive? Mario Kart: Double Dash only for Gamecube.  Then it's time to watch the Paris Hilton sex tape she's a spoiled slut.  Dropping out of school shouldn't be that big a deal. New job - prostitute.

      Gosh, maybe I was too hard on them. New York Law School Prof Cameron Stracher  urlLink has this to say about their ilk , talking about his long hard road to becoming a gunner himself  (emphasis mine):     "Before long, I saw the way younger associates looked at me -- with a mixture of envy and disgust -- and I knew I had become what I once loathed. ... These days,  I'm proud to say ,  I kiss ass whenever I can. I also polish apples, lick boots, and call on the gunners whenever I can.  It's the least I can do. They need our love and attention. Most of all,  we need them ."      Jesus. I'm glad he's not one of my teachers. Calling on gunners is not the least you can do, you whore. If you give them an ounce of the validation and attention they crave they'll never shut up and leave the class in peace. No, Cam, we don't need gunners, we need  teachers  that are actually willing to do their jobs and control the class and keep the gunners in line so they don't hijack the damn lecture and monopolize all your attention. We're paying your fat salary to hear  you  teach us the law, and not some know-it-all 1L. And if I have a question I'd like to ask it without having to fight off your army of sycophants for the opportunity. You're the teacher, it's your job to regulate so the rest of us get a chance. You sound like a horrid professor.  Moving on to a teacher that I bet is really great: Wisconsin Law professor Ann Althouse not only has a blog (and what a cool name, Althouse!), but wrote an  urlLink entry that was inspired by both the article above and my insightful words on the subject!   Ok, I guess I’m flattered that an actual law professor not only read my blog, but actually wrote about and linked to it. But, ironically, the attention that my blog’s been getting is probably going to end up killing it. I never really thought about actual people reading this thing, forget about actual law professors..… I mean, do I really feel comfortable writing about what I really want to write about when I picture actual professors and lawyers reading this?  Anyway, I've decided to get rid of comments for now; that should help me forget about the people reading this.

      Man, I've been away too long; I've been back in the States for a few days, and I've already heard that new D12 single 'How Come' at least a dozen times, and I've seen the video just as much. I also finally saw the new Brittany Spears video where she plays a spoiled superstar slut who has a fight with her Timberlakian boyfriend and metaphorically slits her wrists in the bathtub.  The D12 song again displays how adept Eminem is at the old hip-hop trick of putting your real life (and real beef?) in your music. Both 'How Come' and 'My Band', the other single off the new D12 album, play with the resentment that's supposedly come between Em and the 5 lesser-known rappers in D12 who've known him since childhood. This is brilliant: On the one hand, explicitly talking about how odd it is to be one of the non-Eminem members of D12 is a good way for D12 to justify its existence while showing that they're not blind to the fact that none of them would be successful if they didn't happen to know Eminem, but it also gives Eminem a chance to remind everyone of his legitimate Detroit 8-mile lineage while acknowledging that he was never an actual thug (you ran the streets, I 9 to 5'd it / We grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then I blew up / To both yours and mine surprises). So he gets his street cred while acknowledging his fairly tame background (those clips from his pre-slim shady 'infinite' days that start and end the video) so he doesn't look stupid hanging out with the 5 big black dudes that make up 83.3% of D12.  So Eminem and Brittany.  Both videos are great, and they both occupy the hazy space between the artists' real life and their stage personas; The stars get to have fun by toying with their own tabloid mythology - because the artists themselves are the ones exploiting their own personal relationships they're able to create a confessional that is entertaining because it promises a thrilling glimpse of their real lives; but you don't know what, if any, of it is real, and what's just self-parody or flat-out fiction.

      I just saw Jonathan Demme's remake of The Manchurian Candidate. The  urlLink 1962 John Frankenheimer original * is one of my favorite movies, so I was dreading having to sit through a dumbed-down, actioned-up 'modern' version, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. For once it seemed like the remake was warranted, trading in cold war paranoia for endless-war-on-terror/corrupt-corporate-lackey-president fears. And Meryl Streep was great in the evil mother role, although she seemed more inspired by Hillary Clinton (and the simmering rage of my sister Condi) than by Angela Lansbury's awesome performance in the original. I really dug the remake because it seemed (to me, at least) to have a simple and effective message that would make it fit right in as part of a double feature with Fahrenheit 911: do we really need to worry about an evil company trying to control our country by brainwashing our president? The answer: Of course not! The president we have right now doesn't need a brainwashing and barely has a brain worth washing anyway- he and his whole cabal already answer to their corrupt corporate benefactors. (The movie even had some nice subtle digs on Haliburtonish corporations profiting off of unnecessary militarism and adding insult to injury by overcharging our taxpayers for their services - and also tamperable touch-screen voting booths!)  -Happy August ( Rabbit, Rabbit ) -- Ava Q. Rice, Esquire.   *Trivia from the original Manchurian Candidate:      Prior to commissioning of the book as a movie, Arthur Krim, the then President of United Artists and Finance Chairman of the Democratic Party, is known to have felt uneasy about its subject matter (dealing with the assassination of a US president). President John F. Kennedy, as a favor to his friend Frank Sinatra (star of the film), called Krim to let him know that he had no objection to a film version being made.     After John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963, the film was pulled from circulation by owner Frank Sinatra, who was concerned that some would draw parallels between Lee Harvey Oswald and the film's brainwashed assassin. (He had also heard a rumor that Oswald saw the film before killing Kennedy.) After nearly 25 years, Sinatra relented and allowed a re-release in 1987.    One of the first Hollywood films to use the Martial Arts in a key fight sequence (between Frank Sinatra and Henry Silva).
