       urlLink     Fellowship would like to personally thank all those who have recently accepted their invitations to our blog site. We are happy to see that our community is growing!  Thought for the day:  I know many of you are probably tired and it feels like all of your energy is being taken up. We all work during the week, whether it be at our careers or at our families. It is still work. And I know we look forward to that sabbath rest, but don't forget that everyday should be a day of renewing our strengths. Tap into the spring of the "living water"!  May God be with you throughout the rest of the week.

      It feels so good to finally enjoy the nice weather.  Mother nature is now alive! As the seasons change it feels so natural to change with time. Walking with God is like a beauty regimen. Each day you have to exfoliate to keep fresh.  Exfoliating in a beauty routine is to remove dull, dead skin cells to instantly reveal smooth, healthy skin.     As a notice the spring I also noticed I have been starting over(spiritually,professionally)  This is a daily routine to keep me motivated and radiant.   May peace fill your hearts.

       urlLink    Boston 4th of July Celebration!   Date & Time:   07/04/2004 Noon - Evening   Location:   Boston Esplanade, Depart from Atlantic Union College Men's Residence at noon.   Event Host:   Wildo   Itinerary Details:   1. Meet at and depart from AUC Men's Dorm at noon. 2. Arrive at Esplanade, settle down after finding a good spot. 3. Enjoy the surroundings, the music, the food, the people, and oh yes, the fireworks!   Price:   Bring about $5 for parking and about $3 per person for the subway. You may also want to bring additional cash if you want to buy food or ice-cream from the vendors.   Important Notes:  1. If you happen to be uncomfortable within a large group of people, you may want to re-consider your participation in this event. Typically, immediately following the fireworks, everyone and their mother wants to take off at the same time. This translates into large crowds and sometimes some light pushing and mild shoving. So again, if you are uncomfortable in this type of situation, you've been fore warned.   2. Consider what you are planning to bring and carry with you that day. Remember that you will be on the subway for part of the journey.   Things You May Want to Bring:  1. Food, snacks, drinks, perhaps a small cooler. 2. Blanket, beach towel, or mat where you can sit or lie down. 3. Money: parking, subway, vendors. 4. Cell-phone 5. A fun attitude.   Directions:  From Alewife - Take the Redline Train to the "Charles/MGH" stop.  Alewife Parking Garage and Subway Station  1 Cambridgepark Dr.  Cambridge, MA 02140-2309  For additional information on this event please contact Wildo at wballenilla@earthlink.net

      Denys, I would like to dedicate this letter or posting to you.  I think you have been such a hard worker in bringing all these tips to stay on fire for GOD!  i felt inspired today to inform you that GOD is pleased, and so are we.  You are so creative and you've been an inspration and a positive sister.  May you understand your power and the messages you share only adds jewls to your crown.  "reach people through your acts of kindness"  Thank you!    I would like to suggest the next book.  The Purpose Driven Life by: Rick Warren this is a self help book. zyhre difference between this book and the rest is all the other books tell you to find your purpose within your self, but this book tells you search your creator, and his reason for creating you.  It helps you understand God's plan for you!  It's a fourty-day journey, but it know to change lifes.   One love, and may peace be in your heart. Rose-Laure
