       We saw mean girls yesterday. That was a pretty good funny movie. Although there were some traumatic parts in the movie, overall still thought it was fun!  So the movie made me think about some stuff from high school.. and the different cliques.... my high school was a little different going to an all girls private school...  our cliques were weird...hard to define cliques by type like jocks or nerds or whatever.. it was more like.... clique 1 and 2 and 3 ... no one was more popular than another.... everyone could basically intermingle with any group and it'd be fine...  i think first 3 years of high school i sat with different girls every day or week... but senior year i stuck mainly with the AP "nerds" who really weren't nerds... (wonder if that makes sense)...some of the "nerds" were also "jocks" and also "the cool asian crowd"... neways... yeah...i guess i'm glad i didn't go to a public school....

       This weekend Pam got married to Chad. It was a NYC wedding.  Took Wed thru today off.  Definitely tired but it was a GREAT wedding.  Wed - Joseph and I drove up to NYC with Pam and Chad. I spent the entire ride knitting. I wanted to finish the stupid project before we got to NY. The ride was fun, just chilling and relaxing. We got dropped off at Joseph's parents in Queens and off Chad and Pam went to Chad's parents place.  Oh and the computer that I had order from Best Buy - I ended up buying it from Office Depot instead. Much better...why? because the computer actually shipped and ended up in my in-law's home....that was my project after dinner...setting that up  Thurs - met up with Pam, Amy (Pam's sister), and Pam's mom- we got manicures and pedicures then ran over to chinatown to get eyebrows threaded... i was completely scared... usually when i get my eyebrows plucked it HURTS!... but getting them threaded turned out ok...my eye brows looked like bushes so at first it hurt...she tried to grab a bunch at a time...but after the initial shock it wasn't bad... definitely recommended  After all said and done.. joseph and i met up with Julia to Joe's Shanghai...mmmm...soup dumplings =p... fun times! can't wait till she gets back from nyc and back to md....especially since she's gonna live like 5 minutes from my house =p  Fri - saw Shrek 2 - i thought it was a fun movie..joseph said it was just ok... *shrug* then off to the rehersal... the wedding coordinator of the church was like a "nazi" complete control freak... we didn't really practice..he just sorta told us how things were gonna go... he couldn't understand why pam and chad wanted to do certain things...completely lame in my mind..i kept calling him Tammy instead of Terry... i think everyone was annoyed with him..  sat - the wedding..it was great...first thing in the morning we got our hair and makeup done... kelly did a great job on the makeup.... took pictures and a bunch of other things... maddie - the flower girl - was sooo cute....i kept making her too wild... clapping feet instead of hands and stuff..hehe..her mom kept telling her to "calm down"... the photographer seemed good..he looked korean..but was actually chinese...(chinese people want to look korean for some reason huh? =p) as soon as he found out i was korean he kept busting out the one phrase he knew "ahn nyoung hah sae yo"... everytime he wanted to address me..that's what he'd say.....he'd take the picture and look at his camera and yell "WONDERFUL" or "BEAUTIFUL"... and he couldn't say "candid" he kept yelling "CANDY SHOTS" instead... hahahaha.. the wedding was great and turned out really well except for my awful singing... joseph's sermon really hit it off with chad's friends and family.. very crajee... the reception was "almost" fun... or maybe i'm just a party pooper..but i must admit the dj did a really good job of getting people on the dance floor... actually he was the best ever compared to the DJ my parents hired for the family reception =p ... food was decent... company was excellent and the nite was a HIT!  sun - church day! so sunday morning we got up early to go have breakfast with pam and chad... sooooo tired =p... after that met up with joseph's parents to go to serendipities to eat some more... (notice a theme?) ... then we walked over to the west side and hung out at time warner mall... they parted and we went to Vision church... the speaker was good... maybe alittle "bland" for my tastes or it could be because i was freakin tired from all the activities prior to sunday.... after church dinner with joseph's paternal aunts and their families... always a good meal... had frog legs... (tasted like fish NOT chicken)...then off to sleep.. FINALLY....   mon - got up "early" again...cos we had to catch the chinatown bus and finally got home...   WHEW...after all said and done the weekend was great... lots of fun and joyous times! ... but now i think i have a cold..or maybe it's allergies?.. dunno for sure
