      Why is it that when ever something goes wrong or when there is some one to blame I seem to be the one every one turns to. I don't know if it is just me or if there is othere people who feel this way. For me it is hard to deal with and its sad to say, but i'm actullay not looking forward to summer vaction. Summer vaction for me is usually the worst for me because I live a way from all of my friends which means i get to spend the time with my family. The happest for me would probley be at school when i'm around people who don't judge me. My friends known or I try to remind them that what i say that is mean is just kinding around, but thats different here with my family. To me it seems that know matter what i do or what i say i feel like I can never do anything right. I'm not trying to make it seem like my life is all bad or anyhting like that I have good times and bad times but for me it seems that the bad happens more often then the good.

      Well its Summer again and well. There is nothing I have plan to do this summer which makes it seem like summer will last for ever. Only 2 more years left and our group will disappear. We all have plans for the future and some can't wait to get there others are wishing it won't come. To think this is one of the 2 last summers left before we'll be on our own. Me I don't know what I want to do exactly I just know I want to do some thing useful. Any ways so far this summer I've watched the Dead zone (a very strange twisted show) went fishing caught nothing and watched the monk marathon season premiere starts in a hour and a half yeah.:/

      It's the middle of summer and I can't sleep, I haven't talk to my friends in a while I wonder what they been up to. Anyways I've leaned something this summer about me. One thing being why I feel depressed and why I get irritate easily. I've discovered that when I'm not with a crowd of people I don't feel depressed or get irritate easily. Which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like 6 year olds.
