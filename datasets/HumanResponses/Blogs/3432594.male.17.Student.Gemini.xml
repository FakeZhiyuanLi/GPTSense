       31st May, its my birthday  and what better thing to do than post on the blog.. hmm i can't think of anything better :P. not  I use my computer to experiment with various pieces of software to determine which is the most efficient, reliable, feature-rich. Its usefull to test new software and see what it does for you. It can lead to much more suitable system.  One should tailor their computer to fit their needs. If your a standard computer user and are using your computer the same way the majority of the world is then there is not much need for great improvements on the standard computer. Obviously if you use your computer just for graphical purposes your going to want an upgraded system with as much graphical horsepower as you can find.  I am not sure what I use this computer for, I guess its kind of everything. I try to look in as many fields as I can. I have recently investigated into different operating systems as I figured this vital piece of software is important for every computer user. I tested a range of options such a Linux, Unix, different Windows versions, the BSD range. Testing these products was rather problematic. These were all tested to a amature level of course, no benchmarking or any of that, too much effort. One would think that free software would be easy to download. This is not the case at all. Finding each piece of software and burning it into a bootable form was possibly the most time consuming stage. It was like they were making it free but didn't want me to download it.  My mission was to find the smallest Operating system out there which was able to run applications with ease and be as feature-rich as possible at the same time. I figured small packages would shine when it came to efficiency as no unneeded features which make an operating system heavy would be present. This can only be taken so far however. I was able to get windows 98 down to 10mb but this was, by far, not the most efficient OS. Operating systems Slackware and MicroBSD got very small 30mb-200mb while still being efficient. A knowledge of command based operation is needed for both of these ODes however and I for one are not committed to taking these options further.  Linux proved to be contained in a range of very large packages. Some packages even bigger than that of the Windows XP package. Four cd's for the new Mandrake version 10.  I set myself this investigation not knowing how hard it was going to be. Problem after problem seemed to come up and it was just causing way to much stress on my part. One of these problems was when I installed Mandrake 10 onto a system which allready had Windows XP on it. I created a separate partition for the Linux OS and installed it fine. After I had played around with it I decided to uninstall it. I didn't do this the proper way however. I did it through a program called Partition Magic (very good piece of software) and deleted the partition rather than uninstalling the OS. The problem came when I restarted the computer and received a greeting from Mandrakes Bootloader, LILO(result of not thinking of these things). It was not detecting Linux and upon start up was displaying a page full of the same pattern of numbers(I am unable to recall them now). The solution for this was the slam in the Windows XP CD to access the recovery console and use that to rewrite the Master Boot Record. It did so and the problem was eradicated.  After too many problems to think of  I decided to call it quits on the old OS investigation and I settled for Windows XP coupled with Mandrake. I ended up not writing a report or anything but learnt that installing one OS is hard enough without having to install numerous ones.  ok all the above probably doesn't make too much sense because I am as tired as hell being it 3am here and all. I'm gonna go play Hitman Contracts..

      Hello. I would call myself an above average computer user, not that that is saying a lot.. I take the time to explore many branches or computing and are often testing, experimenting with software and trying to find faster, simpler ways. All regular computer users face loads of problems and I'm just another one of those people. Computer thoughts, problems, solutions i come across shall be posted.. Maybe it will help people out, who knows...  Ok I'm going to start off with my personal computer configuration: -Intel Pentium IV 2.8Ghz -512mb SDRAM -120Gb Hard Disk -Sound Blaster Live! -Geforce Ti4800 Yes it is a standard configuration which is fine, it serves its purpose. I will build a better PC when the task requires it. I have a home network setup comprising of 3 PCs - similair to this one specified above. A slow 386K down and 256K up ADSL connection is my gateway to this internet.  Wall socket > Dlink DSL-502G router/modem > 4 port switch > computers.  Look forward to posting more..
