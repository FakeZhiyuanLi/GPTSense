						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIML, like any other college, has various student clubs and committees. One of the most important is the Placement Committee (Placecom in short). I haven't myself applied for getting into this committee. But one of my classmates has, and after a round of interviews, he has been given a task to be completed in 2 weeks. The task is 'Improving the IT infrastructure of IIML'. Since he doesn't have a technical background (he worked for 3 years for the HR firm Hewitt Associates), he approached me to assist him. I readily agreed, and so we have just begun some preliminary spadework, along with two other batchmates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two days, we have:   Studied the network infrastructure of the whole campus. There is a chart showing this, very helpfully put up in the library  Talked to the Synapse team, which manages some of the software aspects, the IIML website, the intranet portals, etc. and collected inputs about what enhancements they wish to have  Collected some data about the patterns of usage of the network facilities - both the Internet and the Fast Ethernet LAN   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next few days, we will have to think about:   Passing a questionnaire around to both first and second-years, to gauge the general views on what improvements they want  Interacting with some faculty members to find out if they can suggest something from their side so as to utilize the LAN for academic or useful purposes  Doing homework about the costs and installation times of wireless LAN in the academic block, increasing the external bandwidth from 2Mbps to 4Mbps, making optimum use of the Computer Centre, etc.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had idli - vada and sambhar for breakfast today, and they were quite badly made. Uncooked idli and sour-ish and thick sambhar. Vada-s were relatively okay.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After residing in south India for 6 years, the experience in food has been diametrically opposite here. The typical north Indian fare like samosa-s, paratha-s, sweets is excellent here, but they should not attempt any south Indian dish.  &nbsp;&nbsp;

						   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had a long day at classes today, lengthened by several presentations. In another IT class, we had as many as three presentations, with the first one taking 40 dragging minutes when the allotted time was 15 minutes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in the next Org. Behaviour class, we had two more presentations which were mostly empty on content. Throughout these 3 hours, I was thinking of things that were wrong with us when we present a topic, and I could think of the following:  1.  Lack of involvement  - "A good manager should be able to present well." - a truism widely accepted, but this also means that in management schools, presentations have become yet another chore, just like a written assignment, which has to be dealt with, rather than enjoyed. Lack of interest in most topics is clearly visible and if the presenter is disinterested, you can well imagine what the audience would be doing - yes, sleeping.  2.  Lack of relevant preparation & poor content  - We spend so much time coming together as a group and dividing tasks that we have little time left for preparing the actual content that would go into the presentation. So content suffers, we are left with lists of buzzwords and randomly placed images on every slide.  3.  Superficial knowledge  - To some extent, this is unavoidable since people from a non-engineering background cannot be expected to learn concepts in, say, networking and telecom, in a short span of time, and vice versa. Still, if one decides to speak on&nbsp;some aspect, one should ideally be very well prepared.  4.  Poor slide design  - In loading (downloaded) material onto slides, we frequently miss out on good slide design principles. This problem can be further broken down into: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. layout and colour problems - choosing backgrounds and font sizes and colours that are very difficult to make out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. cluttered slides - slides being used as memory aids, every little line is added to the slide. A good slide should have relatively little text on it, unless it is meant to be viewed and understood independently, like the slides used in a lecture by a professor.  5.  No audience involvement  - We have not yet learnt to gauge audience reaction from their faces or gestures, and hence we just do our own thing up there on the stage, without regard to whether the audience actually understands it, whether it is enjoying the topic or is getting bored to death. This is a fatal flaw, because the whole purpose of the presentation - conveying something about the topic to the audience - might be getting lost.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have a long way to go. Of course we will each have several more attempts at presentations and hopefully, will learn from our own and others' mistakes.

						   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been here at IIM Lucknow for 24 days now, but so much has happened in these few days that it feels like a long time. Life is eventful here, there's something to fret about daily, something to be excited about, something to look forward to, something to prepare for.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making good presentations is a skill you learn to continuously refine here. I made my first formal presentation to my class today (as part of a group). The course is 'Information Technology for Management' and our topic was 'Computer Hardware: CPU and Memory'. My part was to explain the working of the CPU as you would to a layman, since people from various different backgrounds make up the class. I had good slides and images (latter courtesy some excellent websites :) ) and the presentation was well-received. There were some good queries at the end and I was able to handle them very well. Overall, a positive experience.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's on the cards for tomorrow? A quiz in Organizational Behaviour (for which about a 100 pages have to be read), a written assignment to&nbsp;be submitted on behalf of my group for the same subject. Relatively little.&nbsp;

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The schedule for the mid-term exams is out. August 9th - August 14th will be the exam week. 7 exams in 6 days.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9th - Law &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10th - Quantitative Analysis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11th - Org. Behaviour &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12th - Accounting &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13th - IT for Management &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14th - Economics, followed by Communications  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ITM and Comm. are 3-hour exams, since they are half-credit courses and so the mid-term is also the end-term for these&nbsp;subjects. For others, the exam will last 2 hours each. Let's see what's in store.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have an Org. Behaviour quiz in a few minutes from now. We also expect as many as 4 quizzes next week.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my major hobbies is quizzing. But that word has to be explained properly to people here, because of a complication - a class test is called a quiz here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have had one quiz for every subject now, with two quizzes in QAM. I did well in the first QAM quiz, but committed an extremely silly mistake in the second one.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we just had a quiz in IT for Management. This was a bit unusual in format because apart from a few true/false questions and one question on databases, it had a crossword of IT terminology to be filled up for 5 marks (in a 10-mark quiz). I didn't really have any problems and smashed the quiz.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow is the second&nbsp;Org. Behaviour quiz. And we expect 3 more quizzes in the next week, which is also the last week before mid-term exams begin.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In class, we applaud something good (a statement by a professor, a&nbsp;presentation, an announcement from the class representative) by thumping of desks. That naturally reminds one  of the Parliament and other legislative bodies where this is&nbsp;a common practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the comparison ends there. The class is too orderly to be compared to our unruly Parliament. People are not allowed to rush to the well of the class (the stage), everybody listens (or pretends to listen) to the 'speaker', questions are asked politely, Deve Gowda-style sleeping is not appreciated, walk-outs are impossible, late attendance is frowned upon, there is an attendance requirement for each session (80%), there are no Treasury and Opposition benches as there is only one party - that of the students, and of course, many others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two other likenesses of the class to our Parliament is that the representation of women is less than 33% (although it is increasing year by year) :), and video recordings of the class occur occasionally.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IIML campus is very green, perhaps too green. It is an 'ecologically rich' place. There are lots of different kinds of insects and other fauna here.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I was watching an inter-hostel football match under floodlights, and then talking on the cellphone, a kind of insect with a hard shell and pointed legs went into my T-shirt and came out with some difficulty. This happened four or five times&nbsp;in 15 minutes.&nbsp;Then on the way back to the hostel, I saw a&nbsp;big frog&nbsp;on the pathway. On my approaching, it took a really big jump to clear half the pathway and straight into the bushes on the side. Paraphrasing Neil Armstrong: 'that was a small step for a man, but a giant leap for a frog' :).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small black light-insects and moths can be seen in the morning&nbsp;in the bathroom and have to be cleared. Even in our&nbsp;class, a small frog has dropped twice from the A.C.&nbsp;vent, leading to some commotion.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There also exist&nbsp;big wild lizards here, which people here call by the name ' vish-khopda ', though I have not seen&nbsp;any so far. And then there are snakes. Again I have not come across them and they are probably not venomous (unlike in Surathkal where they could be deadly).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In certain Indian classical music concerts, vocalists do what is called a  'nom-tom aalaap'.  Here in our first term, for the first three days of&nbsp;every week, we are doing a 'LAM-QAM  aalaap ' :))&nbsp; (LAM = Legal Aspects in Management, QAM = Quantitative Analysis for Management)

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The local people here do have a liking for old Hindi film songs. The owner of the Nescafe stall plays old music most of the time, and most are Rafi songs. One day I heard a peon in the academic block singing ' is rang badalti duniya men ' (Rafi, 'Rajkumar') while doing his cleaning work. He actually sang the entire song with correct lyrics. It was good to overhear him.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday there was a football match between the first year students (PGP1's) and the second year students (PGP2's). The football ground was slushy because of the rain, so the ball kept skidding around a lot and neither team had much control over the ball. Still, our team (first years) won 2-1 and there was much jubilation thereafter.&nbsp; The second goal came in the dying minutes. It was an absolutely stunning free kick taken by one of our defenders from the halfway mark, curving straight into the opposite goal.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  maansuun , or monsoon, seems to have reached here with some intention to stay. After yesterday's heavy downpour, it rained at almost exactly the same time today, albeit for a much shorter time. It's very humid and wet. The pathways in IIML are not very rain-friendly and water-logging is a problem. It cuts out some routes temporarily. Plus the stones used for paving are also slippery to my sandals, whose grip has been smoothened. So I have to walk slowly and carefully.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp; Today is IIML's 20th Foundation Day. We had a special programme on this consisting of the Director's address and address of a Chief Guest (who is an IIML professor) at 2 pm. However, many of us could not be there on time because as we were having lunch in the mess, a sudden and tremendous downpour started, which has stopped only 5 minutes ago. So I am back to the hostel.&nbsp;There is also some programme in the evening at the auditorium. I will probably attend it.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legal Aspects in Management course throws up some amusing bits and pieces here and there = some typical definitions in legalese and some peculiar cases of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have just completed studying the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and some of the cases cited to illustrate various points in this Act make me wonder what kinds of contracts and agreements people get into. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite one case here - that of Khwaja Muhammad v. Hussaini Begum (1910). K had reached an agreement with H's father to supply a fixed sum to H under a specific head in consideration for H's marriage to K's son. This head was called 'kharchi-e-paandaan' (betel box expense)! K established a trust for this purpose but did not pay H regularly after her marriage to K's son. Consequently, H sued for recovering arrears of Rs. 15,000 from K. K contended that the contract was between him and H's father. H was not a party to the contract and hence could not sue. The case went to the Privy Council in England and the Council decided that since a trust was set up with H being a beneficiary, H could indeed sue for recovering benefits in arrears. A most extraordinary case, or, in Sherlock Holmes' words, 'a most singular case'... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case was cited to note&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;exceptions to the general law that 'a stranger to a contract cannot sue for damages in case of breach of contract'. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had&nbsp;a good game of badminton today with my hostel mates. It having rained, the atmosphere was extremely humid and the indoor badminton court was a 'pressure-cooker environment'. I was 100% wet with perspiration, and had to take a leisurely bath to feel somewhat fresh again.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our group completed a very important presentation in Communications class today. This was a 'country report' - you had to pick a country and speak about its history, politics, culture, economy etc., then pick two prominent companies from the country and speak about them, and finally, spell out what an Indian will have to take care about when transacting business with people of that country. The presentation carried 30% weightage in the entire course, and each group was allotted 25 minutes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had picked Sweden and the two companies we selected were SKF (the bearings giant) and Volvo. Ours was the first such presentation in class, so we could make or break it for ourselves. And ultimately, after a lot of practice, it turned out near perfect today. The professor was very happy with it and our classmates were also all praise. My part came near the end when I had to talk about work culture in Swedish companies and some do's and don't's for an Indian wanting to transact business in Sweden. I myself was quite good, if I may say so, and put across the points well. Overall, our preparation came through well.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The special point about this presentation was that it was video-recorded. And in the evening, the professor called our group and we watched the cassette and analysed each and every one's performance. I was a bit surprised with my recorded presentation, because it didn't look nearly as good as it had seemed on stage. Specifically, the following came out:   &nbsp;My voice seemed very monotonous on video, though it was loud and clear.  I was not very fluent and had many intervals of 'er..'&nbsp;between sentences.  My hand gestures were good, but they were restricted. My&nbsp;arms remained at my sides and only the part below the elbow was moving. I need to be more excited about presentations, rather than be matter-of-fact to overcome this.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But still, we hope to get decent grades here because it was as if we&nbsp;had set a benchmark for the class to follow. The next presentation after us (on France) was overshadowed by ours, I feel, although it was good&nbsp; by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sleeping habits have, of necessity, drastically changed after coming here. There's so much group as well as individual work packed into each day that it's easily 2 am before I go to sleep. The last week was particularly hectic, and this week seems almost equally so. So I get about 5 hours of sleep at night, which is a little less than I would have desired. But so far, I have always felt fresh in the morning and while attending classes. But after lunch, the effects of sleeping late are felt and I take a nap of half an hour in the afternoon. I don't like sleeping in the afternoon, but I don't have much choice.

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first term, Management Accounting-I is the most terrifying subject to most of the people most of the time, since about 70% of every batch consists of people from non-commerce backgrounds. In fact, the contagion has spread to commerce students too, and it seems to be as tough for them as for us.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the subject is so fundamental that it can't but be interesting. We have so far covered the basic terminology of accounting, journalizing transactions, recording them in ledgers and various day books and preparation of trial balances. We have now come to Accounting Standard-9, which covers income measurement, or revenue recognition. For tomorrow's class, we have an excellent case study to read up - that of Microsoft's revenue recognition policies and the details of the investigation launched by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against it during the '90s. This should be very interesting. &nbsp;

						   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Quantitative Analysis for Management classes are the most enjoyable and satisfying classes, mainly because of the way the professor teaches. By background, he is a chemical engineer and has done his M.S. and Ph.D. from the US. His complete grasp over the subject shows in the way he goes about his preparation. Although the engineers in the class have studied statistics, probability distributions, etc. earlier, our interest is sustained very well. The professor comes in at the exact time and leaves at the designated time, not a moment of delay or dragging of the class. The slides he has prepared for each class contain excellent animations to make most concepts very easy to grasp. He also makes these slides available through our internal Classroom Online (shortened to 'Claroline') site, so we can download them and go through them to revise the topic. In the 1 hour, he solves peoples' doubts and answers questions, and also solves problems on selected topics  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the mid-term, hopefully we will have him for the Operations Research part of the course too.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And also, he pronounces Tadatmya perfectly.

						         Our Org. Behaviour class today was about stress and stress management. The professor quoted a Sanskrit  shlok  which enumerated five qualities that are desirable in a student so that he may have a stress-free time. These five are:    kaak-cheshtaa  - the persistence of a crow   shvaan-nidraa  - the light sleep of a dog   vako-dhyaanam  - the focus and concentration of a crane   gruh-tyaagii  -  relatively detached from day-to-day and household chores   alpaahaarii  - eating moderately

						         Here's how the second visit came about:   Second visit:         Today, I caught the 2.30pm bus again to do what I left undone yesterday. I got down at Purnea Chowk and took an auto-rickshaw to Hazratganj. The courier office was at Ansal City Centre. From the name of the plaza, it sounded like this would be a posh place, but it was a rather dilapidated structure on inside streets. Luckily, the auto-rickshaw driver knew the location. I picked up the big box and came back to IIM in the same auto-rickshaw.        What's more interesting is my first real glimpse of Lucknow. Some important points:   Lucknow is not very large, it seemed to me. The mentality is also a small-town one, and the pace is very slow. Existence of cycle rickshaws as means of transport illustrates this.  There doesn't seem to be any municipal transport service. Local means of transport are auto-rickshaws, cycle rickshaws, converted tempo-travellers and the larger cars filled to bursting capacity.  On the way to Hazratganj, I came across around three parks which seemed well-maintained and good.  Most of the advertisement hoardings were about establishments in a few areas only - Hazratganj, Aliganj, Shivaji Road, M. M. Malviya Marg, Nishatganj, Indiranagar, etc.  A very large proportion of the hoardings belonged to teaching and coaching insitutes. This included preparatory classes for IIT-JEE and PMT, as well as State board exams. Another very common hoarding message was ' Angrezi bolanaa siikhiye ', by establishments called 'British Insitute of Languages' and 'American Center for Languages'.   I crossed and re-crossed a bridge over the Gomti river. As it flows through the city, it is very narrow, compared to, say, Sabarmati. But it has quite a bit of water. As usual, there are slum settlements on its banks.  Near the Ansal City Centre were several biryani and kebab shops, named ' Dastarkhwan ', ' Naushijaan ', etc.  I also passed by the K. D. Singh 'Babu' stadium, the huge offices of the Geological Survey of India and many colleges.          This was as much as I could get a glimpse of today. Hopefully, I will be able to visit in a more leisurely manner immediately after the mid-term exams get over next weekend.

						          I couldn't get a chance to visit Lucknow city in over a month of staying here. And now I have visited Lucknow twice in two days! Here's how this came about:   First visit:          Yesterday, I was supposed to go to the city and pick up a carton of miscellaneous luggage which had been sent by courier from Amdavad. As I boarded the bus, however, I saw three friends from my class also going to the city, to watch a movie in the only multiplex theatre here - 'Wave'. They persuaded me to come with them and I thought I will have time after the film to go and pick up the parcel.       We got down from the institute bus after having covered a very short distance, as the driver guided us on how to reach the theatre. We had to reach the Faizabad road by cycle rickshaw (yes, they abound here) and hopefully, pick up an auto-rickshaw on the highway. We were two to a cycle rickshaw and it was a roller-coaster ride (although very slow). We managed to get an auto-rickshaw on Faizabad road which took us to the theatre which is very far away indeed. There, we had already missed the 'Spiderman 2' show, so we watched an absolutely horrible David Dhawan film - ' Mujhse Shaadi Karogi? ' The film is undescribably bad.      After the film, I felt Hazratganj (where I had to pick up the parcel) was too out-of-the-way for us, so we returned in an auto-rickshaw all the way back to IIM.      This was a big waste of time when the mid-term exams are so near, but since I had done all other work for today, I was feeling in control and so didn't feel very guilty about it.       More in another post.

						          I'm just back from getting a photo shot at the Placement Office, perhaps to form some online database or distribution to companies arriving for summers and final placements. Everyone was asked to come in formal dress - initially we were asked to come in formal shirt and trousers, a tie and a blazer. This fizzled out quickly, however, because everybody realized that this was not really required. People came wearing formal shirts, but with jeans and sneakers or sandals below, knowing that the only thing required was, in Amol Palekar's words from ' Golmaal ', ' shariir ke uparaardh ka lajja-nivaaran ' :). Moreover, in this kind of hot and humid weather, wearing these clothes is nothing short of torture.        That brings me to a larger point -  how important is it to wear business suits or dresses or such other formal clothing to conduct business well?  To make my position clear, I do not, for a moment, believe that you require a particular kind of dress to conduct business well, or to do any white-collared job, in general. We'll leave out specialized uniforms, like those of workers on the shop floor of factories, miners, workers in integrated chip fabricating units, etc. out of the discussion, for obvious reasons.         Here are some of the arguments advanced in favour of 'smart dressing', 'formal dressing', 'business dressing', etc.  1. Wearing formals is evidence of the fact that you mean business, that you are serious and not casual.  Refutation:  The assumption here is that the way you dress is the way you do all your work too. Obviously, this is laughable. The Silicon Valley software workers showed the way by dressing casually, but doing excellent work. Unfortunately, because of the dot-com bust, people in favour of conservative dressing in the US and around the world got a chance to reimpose their views on the business world and suits were in vogue again.   2. Not wearing formals will make you the odd man out in the business world, where such dressing is the norm.  Refutation:  Actually, this is not an argument at all, in this case. Wearing of formal clothes is a mutual and societal attitude. It is like casteism in India, although less vicious. If we, as a society, agree to drop this norm, it can be dropped readily. But such a change might affect a lot of people badly (just like doing away with the caste system would affect a lot of vested interests) and so this is never done.              My view is that:  the clothes you wear will not actively help you do your work, but they might actually hinder your work, or dampen your efficiency . If a salesman is asked to remove his formal shirt and tie and wear whatever he likes, provided only that it is neat and decent, I believe he will become more efficient and not less so, especially in a country like ours where walking for hours together in formals would be extremely exhausting and draining. In fact, I believe a tie is one of the most superfluous pieces of dress man ever invented.               And finally, it is very amusing to see the use that suits are put to in India (perhaps, learning from abroad): to be worn in marriage receptions, not just by the groom, but by all near and far kin of the groom. Most probably, people will never learn to think about these aspects. That's fine for me, as they provide good entertainment value.

						          This is a term I thought of in class today, perhaps I have coined it. Sleepidemic = sleep + epidemic. Why did I think of this? Because this is a condition spreading fast in the class. Slightly more than 14% of the class (9 out of 63) was actually sleeping, with their heads down on their desks, or sunk low in their seats to avoid easy detection by the professor. Obviously, this is not a healthy trend, but it has been observed over the years because of the working habits and some compulsions here.        There are several reasons for this:   Sleeping very late at night, at nearly 4-4.30 am. The first class starts at 9.10am and so people would need to get up atleast 20 minutes before that. They are in the class without having taken their baths and this contributes to drowsiness.  Because of the above-mentioned waking habits, there is no time for tea and breakfast. So there is no energy to absorb what's going on in class. People rush to have tea in the canteen in the 10-minute break between classes, but this does not seem to have too great an effect.  Disinterest, to some extent, and also the dry quality of subjects like Law, which only a few people enjoy.  Suitable conditions in the classroom - comfortable seats, air-conditioning, wide desks to put your head on.          Some professors do become angry and scold these sleeping people, whereas some have lost interest in waking up people, perhaps thinking that the loss is not theirs and the students should be more responsible.

						        That's the name of the inter-hostel sports trophy. The competition's first event - football - had been playing out for the last several days. Today was the Final, featuring hostels 3 & 4 on the one side (that is our side, I am in hostel 3) and hostels 11 &amp;12 on the other. We ultimately lost 1-0 in an extremely closely contested match, although the second half was very much dominated by the opposing team. Some of the players in all the teams are really good and can make up a reasonably good institute team. However, we don't participate in any inter-institution or inter-college sports meet, so the talent remains confined to this campus.

						          I have done very well or reasonably well in all the quizzes so far. The reason is not difficult to trace: the quizzes have all been very simple and easy. Only some basic understanding of concepts and attention in class is required to do well. The same cannot be said, I think, of the mid-term exams, which will require more focused and in-depth study, particularly in Accounting.        Here's a snapshot of my record so far, which will also serve as a personal reference at this point to me:         Communications - An essay on 'Who am I?' fetched a B+ (highest awarded was A), a quiz fetched 8/10. Another quiz is due on Wednesday.        Accounting - first quiz fetched full marks (10) and today's quiz will also fetch the same, since there was only one embarrassingly simple question to solve        Org. Behaviour - first quiz - 16/20, second quiz - 18/20 (these quizzes had 20 true/false questions to be done in 5 minutes, with +1 for a correct answer and -1 for an incorrect answer. In the first quiz, I attempted 18 with 1 incorrect answer. In the second, I attempted 18, all of which were correct)        IT for Mgmt. - expect 9-9.5 on 10 in one quiz here. Another is due on Thursday or Friday        Quantitative Analysis - 7/10 in the first quiz, 9/10 in the second one.

						          The exams are over, and activities of all kinds have started right now. Here is a snapshot:   There is a workshop on advertising on at this time conducted by a person from Ogilvy & Mather. The response to it has been quite good.  There is an Institute party (or 'Insti party') tonight in view of completion of our exams. Normally, such parties go on till 4-4.30am with a lot of liquor served. But since tomorrow is our Independence Day (a dry day), liquor serving will stop at 12 midnight today and the party will end at 1am. I haven't attended two earlier such parties since I think I won't have anything to do there. Instead I have spent good time watching some good movies on the computer.  The directors of the six IIMs are here at IIML to follow up on their meetings regarding fee structure. And as it has appeared in the papers today, they are actually talking about a fee hike! What a reversal from just a few months ago!  There is an Entrepreneurship workshop tomorrow conducted by Mr. Akash Sethia. I will be attending that. It promises to be very interesting.  Following this workshop, there is a talk on entrepreneurship to be delivered by Mr. Mahesh Murthy, advisor to many big corporations and familiar to us from his column in 'Businessworld'.  There is a teleconference session on Wednesday with Mr. Vikram Gopalakrishnan, head, private banking, Deutsche Bank, and an IIML alumnus. He had come here a few weeks ago to deliver a talk and this teleconference is going to be for hardcore finance students. It will be on popular market instruments, derivatives etc.  The 'Operations Interest Group' has come up with a good project. It is the renovation of the canteen ('Thapa's') here. It includes things like making of proper accounts for the canteen, streamlining procurement and other such things.

						           The first mid-term exams got over at 5pm today. For many people it was a stressful experience, stemming mainly from the fact that they hadn't studied most subjects through the 5 weeks in a regular fashion. Personally, I don't take much tension about any exams - it leads to unnecessary disturbance of mental peace. In order not to be anxious at exam time, I try to study beforehand so that the last day is only for revision of some more important points.         I wasn't able to implement this approach in its totality in this exam, but still have been fairly tension-free and have written the exams coolly. In fact, I have enjoyed writing the papers.          There were two exams today - Economics in the morning and Communications in the afternoon. A total of 5 hours. Economics paper was full of theory except one question where a report from the Indian Express on glut of onions in the market and the plight of Rajasthan farmers was to be analysed in its economic dimensions. The paper was too lengthy for me and I could write only 85 marks worth (out of 100).         Communications paper was again very descriptive with lots of caselets to be read and analysed, an invitation letter, two essays etc. This one went much better.         The QAM professor has released solutions to the exam and I find that as far as answers are concerned, I have got all of them correct. This doesn't mean I will get full marks, however, because there are marks for specific steps and for neatness. But it's a comforting thought.          Overall, pretty satisfied with my performance. According to the new time-table, for the first 3 days of the week, classes start at 8am (it used to be 9.10am earlier). So everybody in class will have to practice waking up early.

						   Finally, the law of averages caught up with me and almost everyone else, as most of us did moderately well or badly in today's Accounting paper. To be fair, it was a really good paper on the following counts:   It covered every aspect of the subject taught so far. Nearly every concept had found a place in the paper.  The marks were also proportionately given - only objective-type questions for the basics, and then more marks for progressively more important things like accounting standards, profit and loss accounts and balance sheets.  It was fully application-oriented - no theory questions. I must say that even though I had a feeling I was not doing very well, I enjoyed writing the paper.   The main thing that went against it was its length. It was an impossibly lengthy paper and I could attempt questions worth only 27 marks out of a total of 35 marks. Of course, in such situations, Relative Grading comes to the rescue. There are hardly a few (mostly C.A.s) who have been able to complete the paper.  On the lighter side, this paper makes me rework Sahir Ludhianvi's words from the Rafi-Mukesh  qawwali  in the film ' Phir Subah Hogi ' (these lines have been sung by Rafi):  ' phirate the jo bhi sikandar bane hue, baithe hain sar pakadke, kabootar bane hue jis  subject  men ye haal ho, us  subject  se tauba, tauba! '

						          The seating arrangement for the mid-term exam is interesting: the room allocation goes according to the roll numbers. However, within each room, the seating arrangement is randomized, not sequential. Not only that, the randomization is done for every exam! So you sit at a different place in the same room in different exams. So, there is obviously a 'great deal of trust' that the authorities place on the students here.         Today's Org. Behaviour exam was based on material covered in classes, rather than from any particular book. This obviously caused a lot of problems for many people who hadn't gone through the class presentations. But I had somehow felt this would happen, and so, we (some three-four people) had gone through the slides together, while reading only a few parts from the book. And we managed to do pretty well today.        As for tomorrow, it is doubtless the toughest test among the seven - Accounting. There are lots of situations that come to mind where you can't think of a proper accounting treatment (because of ignorance) and this has created a lot of confusion. Let's see what happens tomorrow.

						          The mid-terms exams commenced yesterday and we have now completed another 'LAM-QAM  aalaap '.        Yesterday's Law paper was quite simple for the most part. There were about 10 legal situations to decide on, some true/false questions and a couple of short notes. I did fairly well although I couldn't remember the exact Section numbers and relevant cases. Most other people were satisfied with their performance, although there were some mistakes made in the finer points of company law cases.        Today was QAM. The paper had 5 questions, each of them consisting of some trivial or mechanical sub-parts, but with atleast one sub-part where you had to apply your mind and use some fundamental understanding of topics. I was quite confused in two of the questions, but thankfully, got over the confusion and did the problems. So I have done moderately well. But then, the performance of people in general was moderate to bad. Considering that 70% of the batch consists of engineers, this is not a good statement about our abilities. Somehow, this subject always has quite a lot of people getting failure grades (D or F).       Anyway, tomorrow is Org. Behaviour, a most descriptive paper. There is a lot to read.       The weather outside is extremely humid and the sky is very overcast. Strong winds have now started blowing and a good shower is expected.

						          Some of the concepts we are studying in various courses have been in the news recently, and it feels very good to get a confirmation that whatever we are learning is directly helping us understand various current issues.               Firstly, Accounting is always in the news, because of announcement of quarterly results by companies, the recent cases of manipulation of accounts by major companies in the US, etc. Just today the professor in class was saying that contrary to popular belief and to proper practice,  the appointment of auditors by the management  of a company is not necessarily free from bias. The Birla-Lodha case going on, where the Lodhas' status as auditors of various Birla group companies is being affected because of another quite different factor - that of Priyamvada Birla's will bequeathing all property of the M.P.Birla group to R.S.Lodha - was cited as an example of this.        Even a staid subject like Law is very much in the news. The Department of Company Affairs has released a concept paper on  pruning of the Companies Act, 1956  - something we are studying right now. Out of the monstrous 781 sections it currently has, the government thinks as many as two-thirds are redundant or unused, and proposes to reduce the number of sections to 289 only. Every day has a new report in the Economic Times on developments in this area, and the Businessworld comment is also on this pruning and some of the flaws in the concept paper.        There is no real need to point out where Economics has made news. Although not in pure theoretic form, it makes its appearance unfailingly everyday in the newspapers. Today, I saw a report in ET on a concept we recently learnt in this subject:  the difference between short-run & long-run returns, demand, etc.  This report talked about an effort by Morgan Stanley India to work out the highest returns from various investment instruments over 10 years from '94-'04. And the result seemed counter-intuitive in that it was long-term government paper that gave the highest long-run returns, and not equities. However, we surely know that in a shorter-run, people can have invested in equities and got out with much higher returns.

						          I had a haircut in my hostel itself yesterday, in fact, right in front of my room. There is no haircutting saloon on campus, but there are two roving barbers who visit hostels as well as faculty residences, etc. The main advantage with this slightly awkward arrangement is the saving on time. Ordinarily, we would have to go to Purania Chowk in the city to get a haircut. A lot of students do go to the Chowk saloon as they don't like the services of these barbers. As far as I am concerned, I am pretty satisfied. It was quite a unique experience though.

						            Post-mid-term, we have a new course - 'Operations Management - I'. It's a most interesting course about managing the 'creation, production and delivery of goods/services'. The professor is also very energetic and witty and the first class today was really enjoyable. He is said to be one of the most respected professors in the institute.           The QAM mid-term papers have already been checked. The marking was pretty liberal and I got 28/30, a high score. There is one person in the class who scored 30, two or three with 29.5 and 29. In this subject, we will be studying linear programming for the remaining term.           We have three major projects (Economics, Org. Behaviour & Accounting)  and two major assignments (Operations and Law) to be done in these 5 weeks.

						          I visited Lucknow with two of my friends yesterday. We wanted to watch a movie but the theatre was house-full. So we basically just roamed up and down Hazratganj for a few hours and came back. Some observations from the visit:   Movie halls are very expensive. A balcony ticket cost Rs. 80 in a normal, non-multiplex theatre. A movie hall showing a B-grade movie also displayed ticket prices of Rs. 50!  Just a few metres from Hazratganj market is the U.P. Vidhan Sabha, magnificent from the outside (draped with horizontal and vertical Indian flags on Independence Day), but the scene of some of the worst legislator behaviour inside.  Directly opposite the Vidhan Sabha was the BJP  pradesh karyalay . The GPO and LIC offices are also close to the market.  Close to the Vidhan Sabha was the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel memorial park, with a big statue of the Sardar. There are a lot of statues of national leaders in Lucknow.  From a building opposite the park, loudspeakers blared the usual Hindi patriotic songs. But the sound quality was so bad that the songs were butchered.  The market seemed very lacklustre, probably because most of the shops were closed on Independence Day.  Bargaining is very prevalent, not just with street-side vendors, but also in shops and stores. One of my friends bought a shirt after bargaining (in spite of there being a sale) from a shop funnily called 'Montie Charlie' (no doubt, derived from Monte Carlo).  We had a taste of the famous north Indian chaat and then went to Cafe Coffee Day for having a cold coffee and generally passing time.  Finally, we caught a six-seater tempo (a cheaper means of transport than an auto-rickshaw) and came to Aliganj at the IIML City Office and caught the 8.30 pm bus back to the campus.  It had rained slightly in the afternoon, so the weather was extremely humid throughout and I was drenched in sweat for most of the time. Had to take a bath on coming back to the campus.         Overall, it was good fun.

						   That is the name of the programme organized on Sunday by 'Abhiyan' - the entrepreneurship cell here. It started off with a talk by Mr. Akash Sethia, IIML alumnus of '96 or '97, who runs a software firm from Indore, specializing in geographical information systems. His talk was rooted in the ground realities of issues in entrepreneurship - the cost of failure, when to start, how to start, spreading of risk, the struggles involved, basics of preparing business plans, etc. It was a simple and straightforward talk.  The next talk was delivered on a similar subject of entrepreneurship by Mr. Mahesh Murthy, who runs a company called Passionfund from Mumbai, and 'advises, guides and occasionally invests in businesses'. He has a background in advertising where he has worked as a creative director. He is familiar to us through his column in Businessworld. He was typically blunt in his talk and busted some popular myths/perceptions. The audience was very much involved in asking questions, arguing the points etc. But he turned every argument of the students on its head, drawing from his wide experience. He gave a lot of examples which kept the talk very interesting. Here are some of the points he talked about:   As a would-be entrepreneur, if you see a 'trend story' in a newspaper or magazine about some sector or industry, which also profiles the top 3 or 5 companies operating in the sector, that sector is as good as dead for you. (Sumantra Ghoshal's Rule of Threes was cited.)  Ideas, by themselves, mean nothing. It is the ability to execute on ideas that is most important. Ideas are a-dime-a-dozen. 'I don't invest in ideas, I invest in businesses.'  An entrepreneur is one who refuses to fit into any mould.  If you have a product or service that is sufficiently different or provides even slightly more value than the existing ones, go to market with it as soon as possible. Never wait to perfect the product or service, as that will take unbounded time. First deliver to the market what you have, promising that the best is yet to come.  Enter a market when the demand is down or the general condition is bad, not when the market is riding high. If you do the latter, when the cyclical forces push the market down, you will find yourself inequipped to deal with the situation.  Don't rely on venture capital to start your business. If you can manage the necessary resources by yourself, or with help from relatives/friends, etc., do so. As an entrepreneur, you must take maximum risk on your business plan yourself. Don't expect others to take funding or other risks for you, if you show yourself to be unwilling to take such risks.  The maximum returns or margins lie at the end of the value chain delivering directly to the end-customer.   You can very well enter a market at this end of the value chain, rather than climbing your way up from the bottom.  Pricing is a big weapon in building a brand. Starting out with little cash resources, you should keep your pricing structure high, not low in order to build your brand. Sustaining a low-cost product or service in a competitive market requires deep pockets, which you most probably will not have. Price undercutting is a weapon for the big companies, not small fry.  The companies with the biggest ad-spends are actually the worst marketers. (Examples of Coke and Pepsi given).   Your product or service should show enough differentiation and should be able to create enough value for the customer so that word-of-mouth publicity becomes your biggest marketing tool. 'If people come to me with a business plan with a large marketing budget, I tell them to go back and rework the plan.'  'The biggest mistake you can make at IIMs is to believe that your education is going to be of any value to you.' The basic point was about people 'disrespecting' their education. A Computer Science engineer from IIT-Kanpur takes up marketing at IIM-Ahmedabad and because investment banks pay the most, takes up a banking job.  'Placements are a very lazy way of getting jobs. It is like saying to companies, " main yahan aa gaya hoon, ab mujhe yahan se le jaao. " Go out there and get a job for yourself.'  Placements are also for lazy HR people who don't want to find out the best available talent for themselves. They just assume they will get it at some of these institutions.   There might be some more major points I am missing but this gives an idea of how things went. Finally he said, 'There is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow of life. The gold is all to be found on the rainbow itself, provided you are looking for it. And I believe entrepreneurs just have a more colourful rainbow.'
