      Things have changed so much lately these days its just like…whoa. Wait. Stop. Who the hell am I turning into. What the hell is my life turning into. In some cases its good, others…I wish it was still like that.  I remember being at the beginning of the year and loving everything about my life. I was getting along real with my mom, soccer was going on, I didn’t have to worry about guys because I gave up on them, my friends all seemed to have a deeper meaning of who I am after not talking to me all summer. I was even getting good grades. I was passing German at one point!  Then it all seemed to go down hill. Get wound up in a blender and is being spun in royal havoc.   I started dating Chris, and then even more guys saw that I was becoming available after all the put downs and were trying again and I still was doing ok. There were a few rough spots with my friends, where I was growing and they still seemed to be stuck in middle school stage. I eventually saw that I still wanted to be that way; that I didn’t want to grow up to fast. I still have my very hyper immature moods.  I and Chris broke up, but the other guys still had interest, I had started talking to Joey at this point, but it was mainly about music and his band, far from what we talk like now, and sometimes I wish our conversations were limited strictly to that, but hey, I like the ones we have now too.   I and my friends were doing great. Although Jessica was getting into rough spots I had people like Tosha, Henry, and Courtney to help me through. I love them for it. Some of the greatest friends I will ever have.  I and Chris started dating again, then I found out he was using me, and then my guy relationships started failing again. I even became really unreasonable saying that I was going o become a nun and not have kids or marry. Which if you ask me now; you will surely know that that has totally changed, mainly because of Joey.   Then I and Joey started becoming interested in each other, joking around about him coming here and such. Somehow it all became reality.  I had gone from the little girl who didn’t want to date anymore and run around not having a care in the world to the “mature responsible” (these are only in quotes because I often find myself resorting back to the later one this past month or two) girl who has found the perfect guy and cant even fathom with being anyone else with all the problems and cares in the world.  I seem to be fighting a lot with my mom as of late too. I have no clue why. Mainly because I seem to be talking to her about things more. Like Chris and Joey and skipping school. Then it all leads to me being grounded a whole lot more too.   Sometimes I just wish I can go back to the days where I was the careless Caitlyn, where I didn’t have to care what I looked like or what I did or what I said because I didn’t care what other people think. Now its like I have to watch everything I say and do because I am restricted in so many new ways.  I know this is a part of growing up, and you are most likely going to comment with something like, Caitlyn Its ok I’m here for you, your just growing up and experiencing new things, just stay who you are. But those aren’t the words I need right now.   I just need someone there for me, and now it seems like I have no one because so much in my life has changed and no one besides I know what is going on. That I am torn between two groups of people, my friends and school people and Joey, and that the people at school all know what happens at school day to day but know very little about Joey and will never really understand how I feel about him and then Joey were he knows almost everything about me…more than anyone else really knows, but I am so limited to when I get to talk to him. I am either grounded, or away on soccer tournaments, or he’s gone at work or at a show or practicing or jamming.   Which I totally support. I love it when he is at a show so he can come home and tell me all about it, or when he is home from practicing so I can hear about there latest material or how awesome he was doing at drums. It really makes me happy. I get giddy just thinking about. It’s weird.  I just sometimes wonder what I got myself into. If it will be good or bad in the long run. If all these things I am sacrificing will turn out for the better or worse. If me and Joey will get married have a bunch of kids and such or if we will end up braking it off. I love him so much and can’t really see myself with anyone else. But sometimes I wonder about him. If he is just looking for some or something or if he thinks he feels that way. I know I doubt myself about Joey sometimes, but I ALWAYS end up realizing that this is how I truly feel.  I have to continue doing my homework. It was good to get that off my chest though. Thanks for listening.
