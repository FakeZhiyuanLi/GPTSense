      It's been a fairly uneventful week. Voice lessons, Work, etc. On Monday I went with Timea and Markus and Johnathan to the Petting Zoo. They loved the Goats!   Voice lessons are going well, we only have one more lesson left for the semester, but there's a recital coming up (not sure when yet).   Johnathan's 7th birthday is coming up next week (June 4). So I've spent the last 2 days making a birthday cake for him. Two actually. The first one is actually an UPRIGHT dinosaur complete with spikes on the back. The other one is a rectangular cake with a blue river running across it, a volcano in the top right corner and the rest is green (for grass). It's decorated with those sour dinosaur shaped candies as well. I'll take pictures of it before its cut. Though I can honestly say I am SICK of icing. I've done nothing but make icing and ice cakes for the past 8 hours! Blech!  Anyway it's off to bed.   Good night.  Hannah

      Wow! My first blog entry. Wow! I said that already - sorry. Anyway on with the info!  The last week has been pretty quite. Mostly I've just been working, practicing voice, and hanging out watching DVD's of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel" that I rented.   I made Shara squeal at my voice lesson on Monday because I showed her my new "Lord of the Rings" music books (one from  Fellowship   and one from  Return ). The books have both the piano and voice for many of the songs from the sound tracks, including pieces that have ELVISH in them!!! Anyway, to keep a not so long story, not so long, I am doing "The Steward of Gondor" for the June recital - complete with Elvish choral opening (Anne and probably Lara will be helping with that part) and then I get to sing the song "Home is Behind" that Pippin sang in the 3rd movie. I'm also doing 2 other pieces for the recital - Plaisir D'Amour, and Sento Nel Core. It should be a good one.  Oh and at my lesson this week I also finally got a copy of the CD from our last recital in March. I've listened to snippets of it so far and it's pretty neat. I still find it kind of weird to hear my own voice recorded. But everyone else sounds fantastic!  Wednesday after work I went to a gathering at Kate's house for people who've gone on the Mexico Trip to Cuernevaca in the past few years. David was here from Newfoundland and lead us in a nice Mass and some great discussion questions. It was really good to meet with everyone and re-evaluate where we are at in our lives and our processing of experiences that we've had since Mexico. It was interesting too because not all of us went the same year, so each of us brought a very different perspective. Wednesday certainly gave me a lot to think about.   Thursday after work I bought the materials to build a medicine cabinet for my freshly painted yellow bathroom (the whole thing is going to cost less than $25). I did some work on it that night (like drilling the holes in the side for the shelves) but then Friday Morning before work I put it together. So far it looks pretty good. Only a few minor catastrophes (such as a nail deciding to poke out of the side where it doesn't belong - tsk!). After work I gave the frame a first coat of white paint. I'll give it the second coat on Saturday. Then I can attach the mirror to the front, assemble the shelves and mount it in the bathroom above the sink!   Friday Night I went to Amanda's for a girls night. It was great! We watched movies, ate lots of veggies and a bit of junk food (honest, we left more junk food behind than Veggies), and talked about... well... "girl stuff"!  Well, I think it's time to say goodbye to my very first Blog post, and wish you all a wonderfully, blessed day.

       urlLink J.K.Rowling Official Site - Harry Potter and more   If you are a Harry Potter fan you HAVE to check this out.. I discoved it kind of by accident last night and ended up spending HOURS reading it. SO good. JK Rowling writes all the material herself and there are tons of little tidbits and hints about upcoming books. She also despells some popular rumors. There is also a sort of online journal thingy (set up like a newspaper) where she writes a small update once in a while. VERY Awesome Site. I Highly recommend you check it out (but make sure you do it when you have time to spend exploring!)   Hannah

      So I just got back this weekend from training up a camp. I got to meet the rest of the staff and some of the volunteers I'll be working with this summer. It was a lot of fun, but exhausting - especially because it's been so hot lately. I was very grateful for the lake (and the lifeguards who let us go in about 2-3 times a day) it was a great way to cool off in the middle of the day. I forgot both Hat and Sunscreen this weekend so I'll have to make sure I remember those for the summer. If it stays this hot it will be necessary.   Last week was pretty typical so I'll spare the details, but work was busy. (even busier today!). Johnathan finished school for the year on Friday! Now he's off for the summer. I haven't talked to my mom for a few days but I'm sure he must be happy to have a break!   This week is my last week in Victoria! Next Sunday night I head up to camp for a full week of training and after a weekend off I head back up for the first week of camp - wow campers arrive in less than two weeks! It's approaching quickly. I'm glad that I get to come home every weekend though, and that it's not too far to travel.   OH! And I FINALLY know when my voice recital is! I found out at my lesson tonight - it's going to be THIS FRIDAY!!! At the home of one of the other students YIKES!!! I need to practice this week - work out a few of the kinks... otherwise I think it sounds good.  Anyway I'm tired and off to bed but wanted to write a quick note since it's been a while.

      So I got home from Port LATE last night. I had a great weekend visiting with Leanna. And can I just say - her family is FABULOUS!!! Weird, but fabulous. They were so kind and welcoming.   Port is, well, a SMALL town - I liked it though. I won't go into a full detailed description of my weekend 'cause I'm too tired to type that much. Friday night after I arrived (luckily making it to the hump of the construction before 7 so I wasn't delayed!)Leanna and I went to see Shrek 2, (her brother and his friend Brian came too) It was HILLARIOUS! Way better than the first one in my opinion!   Most of the weekend consisted of seeing some of the sights in Port and hanging out with Leanna (and apparently Rob) at the Hotel Leanna works at. It was interesting to say the least. Between 7 + hours as an introduction to Rob and psycho non customers who freak out at Leanna over nothing the time was definitely entertaining... Also, during my weekend I was enlightened by some interesting details such as:  * Leanna has a GPA of 23.7 (according to her mother)  * Leanna is studying in "The Faculty of Dead Things" (also according to her mother) * John (Leanna's Brother) has an IQ of 28 (as he proudly announced at breakfast on Saturday - he forgot about the 100) * Del shall henceforth be known as "Susie Homemaker" and once asked Sandy (Leanna's Mother) how to get bread dough out of shag! * Sandy claims to have an IQ greater than Del's - a fact which was much in debate at the breakfast table! * Fr Kaz IS kind of Scary - but he made some very interesting points about the Eucharist in the Homily even though he started yelling near the end - he's a good speaker - and the chuch in port is Gorgeous!  I drove home late last night (Sunday) after hanging out at the hotel with Leanna for a while. It was getting dark and the roads were kind of wet and downhill and curvy, so since they were unfamiliar I took them slow. I managed to make it home by about 12:30. Apparently it was good that I stayed later anyway because there was a bad accident on the malahat earlier in the evening that backed up traffic for a while. Anyway, I got home safe and had a good night sleep before taking Johnathan to school this morning. It was their kindergarten Graduation and they all looked so cute in their paper grad hats and got to proudly take home their "Diploma in Rhymes"!!! (so cute!)   Work was workish and then I came home and made homemade iced tea which is still steeping, and dinner which I ate and was yummy and chocolate chunk cookies which are yummy but burned me when I tried to catch them to stop them from falling on the floor... Oh well.. They are good anyway. and my hand doesn't hurt as much anymore.  Well I'm off to bed for the night.

      to the great unknown (to me) known as Port Alberni.   After work today I get to hop in my car and drive up island to visit Leanna. Hopefully I'll be lucky and my timing will be such that I wont get stuck waiting for 2 hours for construction. Why can't they just build the roads right in the first place?!?!?   Anyway some brief highlights of my week. Monday night my voice teacher never showed so that was annoying but I did get to see Timea while I was out that way. Tuesday Emma came over and I helped her start to figure out courses for her first year at UVic. She has a lot of decisions to make! Wednesday Amanda came over for Tea after dinner! It was great to catch up and hang out. And it was the first time Amanda had seen my place! We totally have to do that again sometime! Thursday I spent about 5 hours after work trying to make dinner - mind you I was multi tasking big time so that's why it took so long - laundry, dishes, making lunch and dinner for the next day as well - and getting directions to Port! Busy Busy! But it's done and I'm packed and now I have to go get ready for work.   Look out Port Alberni! Here I come!!!

      Sunday was Johnathan's 7th birthday. Talk about Chaos. Some of his friends from school came and so did a bunch of kids from the coop so there were dozens of children running around all over the place. Lukily the party was outside! I arrived a bit early - right after church with the cakes in tow. Then I helped my mom set up enough food to feed a small army. The menu of choice - hot dogs and Kraft Dinner! After lunch there was the inevitable whirlwind of presents in which Johnathan gained far too many new toys and many dino themed things. Then came the unveiling of the dino cake. John was pretty excited. And all the kids were excited about eating it! Some pictures were taken before the cakes were demolished. As soon as they are developed I will try to scan them so I can post them up here.   Sunday night I went swimming with Anne- or rather we hung out in the hot tub for an hour. It was nice.   Monday was a busy day. I took John to school but he had a major breakdown before 9:30 so I spent the next half hour coaxing him into the car to take him home (he was pretty much in hysterics). It was heartbreaking. Once he was safely home I had some unanticipated time to kill before work so I went out to UVic and took in my acceptance letter and deposit to hold my spot in the Education program. Then I waited to meet with an advisor to ask some questions about the program.   I still had some time so I stopped back in at John's school to let his teacher know he was okay and to arrange another time to come help her out. I ended up helping her assess some of the kids right then. Next it was work.   After work I headed up to Colwood for my voice lesson which turned out was cancelled without my knowledge so I waited for a bit but since Shara never showed I headed for Timea's house since we'd agreed to get together after my lesson.   Had fun hanging out with Timea and the Kids - man are they hyper though. Then we watched a few episodes of Angel together and then I came home and went to bed - I'm so boring!   Today was pretty much a work day but after work I went to Dee, John, Emma, and Matthew's house for Dinner. It was really nice to catch up with them as it's been a while. I got to visit with Dee for a while while John made dinner and we waited for Emma to get home. After dinner (hamburgers and salad) Emma and I came to my house so I could help her start to figure out courses for next year (it will be her first year at UVic). I also had to babysit for Maryann and Dan's kids (the people upstairs) so I did double duty helping Emma while Dario played. Julia was pretty tired and cranky tonight and cried on and off pretty constantly until 7:30 when I finally just put her to bed (I was supposed to wait until 8).   Now I shall head to bed as I am tired and I have to work in the morning.   Goodnight and God bless to anyone reading this.  Hannah

      In my last update I forgot to mention that I saw Raising Helen last Sunday - Such a good movie. I won't give anything away but it has some really sad moments mixed in with the great comedic stuff. And Kate Hudson is just so amazing as an actress. I can't really say much more about the movie without giving anything away, but if you want to watch a movie that will make you cry one minute and have you laughing the next and leave you with an uplifting feeling when you leave the theatre, I highly recommend it!  Still really excited about getting into the Faculty of Ed! Seems so much like a dream though - very surreal. I went online last night and figured out my schedule for next year. For Education it's different from most course selection in that you get 3 time tables to choose from with all your required education courses scheduled in. There are still five required electives from other faculties that have to be taken in 3rd year though so those courses then have to be fit in around the time table. I am SO glad I took 2 of my electives for this year last semester. It means I only have 3 classes to fit in - it's still going to a pretty heavy year though.   Providing I get in to the classes I want, I will be taking 5 classes in the fall (one of which only runs from Oct15 - Nov 6 and is on friday nights and all day Sat) 4 of these are education courses (which include PE and Music) and the 5th is a Lingusitics course on cross culture communication. In the Spring I will have to take 6 courses. 4 of these are education courses, but the other 2 shouldn't be too bad. One is another Linguistics course on Grammar which is actually something I've wanted to work on for quite some time but I didn't know UVic had such a class. The Other one is an Art Education class on painting which should be fun. I've missed the art I used to get to do when I was in Hight School.   WOW!! Dan (landlord) just knocked on my door and gave me a beautiful bouquet of flowers! It's a congratulatory gift from Beth and My Dad... Awwwww - Thank you so much for all of your support and everything you've done for me!   Tomorrow is John's birthday party - the cakes I made last weekend will have to come out of the freezer and somehow get from here to my mom's in one piece - hmmmmmm - this could be an interesting feat. Oh well - seeing his face when he sees the cake will make it all worth it!   My back is killing me (it's been really sore lately but I can't afford Chiro or Massage right now) so I think I'm going to have to go lie down or something.   I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!

      Wow! So much to write about! I think this is going to be a long one!  Whew, where to start? I think I will leave the good news for the end and start at the beginning...  Way back when I was a baby.... not that far back? Oh okay, why don't I start at last Monday instead.   I usually take my brother to school on Monday mornings and act as his aid for the morning (he's in Kindergarten). But this week he had a special Dr's appointment and my mom needed my help getting there and then watching Nicholas (the 5 month old foster baby that is with her right now - he was a preemie so he's still tiny). So I got to play with the baby (which involved feeding him, burping him - which meant I got spit up all over, and rocking him to sleep) while my mom and John went in to see the Dr. The Occupational therapist was there too. We've been trying to figure out what John's disabilities are for months with not much luck. He has a lot of behavioral challenges and so far we haven't had much success. But we finally seem to be getting somewhere. This Dr. figures that one of the things he has is FAS and/or ADHD and has prescribed Ritalin. We're going to see if that makes a difference. If it works then we might be able to get down to the next layer and figure out what his actual disability is. This will hopefully also help us get funding for him to have a full time aid for Grade 1 next year.   He's been on the meds for a few days now and they seem to be making a difference already. When situations have come up that would normally cause him to have a total melt down that lasts about and hour, he's still melted down but it's been short - like 5 minutes. I'm hoping that once he's adjusted to the meds he'll be even better.   Anyway, back to my week, on Monday, after the appointment, I went to work. I'm working 30 hours a week now, which is good. Of course this week, the week I start with the more hours, registrations slowed down and I got so caught up I had to make up stuff to do. Of course, by the end of the week I got some new projects to do - like calling references for a bunch of the summer volunteers. That's actually kind of interesting and fun. And it's a nice variation from the regular data entry and organization that I do. I'm really enjoying work though. It's a fun job and I work with some great people. My job centers mostly around taking registrations for camps for the summer and organizing all the information that we need. But it also involves arranging kids in cabins and greeting them at the start of camp and that kind of stuff.   I can't believe it is June already. The past few months have been such a blur. In another 2 weeks I head up to camp for the first training weekend (right now the camp office is based in Victoria, so I don't have to drive out to Shawnigan lake every day) June 19 and 20. Then on June 25 we move the office up to Camp and then 28th we have a full week of training and finally on July 5, the first camp starts, and from that point on it's going to be chaos and mayhem, and many young children running all around... It's going to be GREAT!  The rest of my week has been pretty good too. Voice lesson on Monday night went pretty well. I still don't know when the recital is but my songs are getting better. I really should practice though. I only have 2 more days until my next lesson, and my Italian song still needs some help. Not to mention my Elvish. Then I went to visit with Timea and the babies. Markus and Ayden are just the cutest kids ever! After they went to bed Timea and I finished etching the mirror she made me as my birthday present. It's now attached the the medicine cabinet I built, but it's still sitting in the hallway because I have to wait to get help to put it up and I haven't' been home early enough the rest of the week.   On Wednesday I went to Jocylyns house for dinner after work. Amanda, Stefan and Amanda also came. I got there first but it took a while to get in because her house is GINORMOUS! She told me to go around the side of the house and knock on the back door. Only problem is, there are about 12 back doors!!!!! I did eventually find the right one though. Okay, Jocey's house is just so AMAZING! I love it so much! It's Huge and it's old, I'm thinking 1800's - ish. It has a very colonial style and rooms and doors all over the place. There were 4 floors, complete with large open sitting rooms, a dining room with the most amazing little nook surrounded by windows and containing one of the 2 grand piano's! The stair cases are cool and windy. And there are like a million bathrooms, all with claw footed bath tubs. And on the upper levels there are long, long hallways with all sorts of rooms off of them. I swear there's a secret passage in there somewhere. Jocey's room is really cool. Small doorway and interesting shape but such an awesome attic bedroom - description wouldn't do it justice, but believe me - it's great! The best part of the house though was the long corridor in the basement. It's all concrete, white and sterile, and VERY narrow. It leads to an entrance under the main door to the house and there are a few small rooms off the hall that I think were probably servants quarters back in colonial times. All in all and awesome place to live. Jocylyn is so lucky. Anyway, we had a yummy dinner of Pasgetti and sauce, followed by Amanda L's "Peace Be With You" cake, and Stefan's cherry crisp. Then we all sat out on the 3rd floor "VERANDA" and talked until it got to cold.   Thursday morning I took John to School because his regular aid had to attend a track meet. It was a lot of fun though. John's teacher is awesome and she had me help her measure the kids for their growth charts and then help her assess some of them on their reading and counting abilities. It's given me so much great hands on experience, helping and volunteering in her classroom this year, and it has definitely given me more confidence in my future teaching abilities. This morning I went in before I had to work and helped out for an hour with stuff like pasting info into the kids' scrapbooks that they get to take home at the end of school and stuff like that. It's so much fun!   Then after work today I got went to go see HARRY POTTER #3 with Jocylyn. It was soooooo good. I liked it better than #1 & 2 but the story from Book 3 has always been my favorite anyway. I won't give anything away in case you haven't seen it, but I did find the movie a bit rushed - I would have liked to see a bit more of the day to day stuff. But other than that I really enjoyed it. And the Kids are all still so cute, but they sure have grown up a LOT since the first movie... Especially Neville...   Anyway, after the movie, I dropped Jocylyn off and came home -and that's when I got the bestest news ever in my entire life so far. After all my angst, hardwork and prayer - I got in to the Faculty of Education for September 2004! I am so thrilled! I was in shock when I first heard the news! Marianne (my landlady) knocked on the door and gave me the letter pretty much as soon as I walked in the door. She was about as excited as I was, because it means I get to keep living here and they don't want me to go anywhere (she actually threatened to ground me or lock me in my apartment earlier this week when I suggested traveling in the fall if I didn't get into the program!)   I still can't believe that I'm now truly only 3 years away from being a fully certified, honest to goodness teacher! I've wanted to be a teacher pretty much from the moment I started school, and though the process of getting to where I am now has been long and arduous the reward has been far worth it. And I still have lots of hard work ahead of me! But now I'm over the first hurdle of actually getting in, which I was so worried about. My average ended up being lower than I wanted this year but miraculously it was still enough to get me in. I don't think I can ever thank God enough for this blessing. But I can certainly try - by doing my very best and becoming to most amazing teacher I possibly can, and making a difference in children's' lives. I'm one more step closer to making that happen - wow. This only goes to show that when you set your mind to it, pray about it, and work hard, dreams really do come true!

      So I just got back from Spiderman 2! The title of this post is an actual line from the movie! Anyway I thought it was really good. I personally liked it better than the first one, though I'm a total sucker for romance and this movie is ripe with it so I was thrilled (it also had lots of action and emotion and such as well). I won't say much else so as not to spoil the movie for those of you who haven't seen it yet!  After the movie I ran into one of the Claire's from work (there are 2!!!) She was sitting in the row in front of us! It was neat to be starting to run into people from work outside of Camp all of the sudden. Suddenly I know 18 people I didn't know before! For an introvert, my list of friends and acquaintances sure is growing quickly! That's a good thing though I suppose.   Anyway now it's off to bed. I probably won't post again until next week when I'm back from work (I head back up tomorow afternoon) so I hope that everyone has a wonderful week and I'll talk to you all again soon.  Also a belated "Happy Canada Day" to everyone! And to all my family in the states - Happy 4th of July tomorrow!

      YES! I have successfully registered for my classes! I got into everything no problem with the exception of EDUC 303 but they will probably open another section of it (I'm hoping). I'm on the Waitlist #14, but they said that if more than 50 people register/waitlist for the course they will consider another section, so I'm hoping... they only offer one section for all 78 education students so it's quite possible that will happen.  Anyway now I am going back to bed because it is early, I had a long week, and I am still tired.  Later all!

      I register for classes tomorrow morning and I just checked web TT and there is still lots of space in the courses I've chosen for my electives (I dont' get to choose the rest really) so I'm very happy! I'm confident I will get into the classes I want when I register in the morning!   And now, I go to bed!  Hannah

      I just got back from a week of staff training up at camp. It was an awsome but exhausting week. I left on Sunday for camp after a bbq at Kate's house (which I didn't stay long at!). Got to settle into my room, set up the office and sleep. Then Monday the Craziness began. I was back and forth between the office and the training workshops, which made it kind of difficult. It was really hot though so it was nice to be able to retreat to the cool of the office. (which is in the basement and is basically a tomb with only one window - I call it the dungeon) We finished pretty late on Monday (close to 11) and then had to get up for 7:15 on Tuesday which was rather painful and actually quite indicative of the rest of the week (in which the pattern of 7:15 - 11pm continued with very few breaks).   Tuesday's afternoon workshop was really neat! We did the Myers/Briggs personality type indicator test, and had a whole workshop on it!. It was really facinating and I learned a lot about myself and the rest of the staff. It also really helped all of us really start to come together as a staff community for the summer. I am an ISFP. If you don't know Myers Briggs: I= Introversion, S= Sensing, F= feeling, and P=Perceiving (although I was actually tied with J = Judging for the last one, which Anne pointed out could be indicative of me being Catholic with the whole Judgement/Perception thing, but who knows!) We were given a handout with a detailed description of our personality type but I forgot it in my room at Camp so I can't share it now as I was planning, but I do have the short description that they have in the test:   ISFP are: Quiet, friendly, sensitive, and kind. Enjoy the present moment, what's going on around them. Like to have their own space and to work within their own time frame. Loyal and committed to their values and to people who are important to time. Dislike disagreements and conflicts, do not force their opinions or values on others.   I thought this was a pretty accurate description of me, though I did like the longer one better because it was even more bang on, but I'll have to share it next weekend if I remember to bring it home.  This is getting long, so I'll be breif... maybe! Anyway, the week was pretty much filled with lots of workshops and activities on teambuilding, child development etc. Thursday we go to do an awesome ropes course challenge that some of the kids will get to do this summer. It was kind of like the activities we did at the retreat in September (for those of you who were there - but more indepth). The staff were split into two groups and we had to work together to get across various challenges like walking across a long wobbly wire (about a foot off the ground). There were some ropes hanging down along the way to help with balance but it was made difficult because some of the ropes were tied up to make it more challenging (this meant that people like me who are vertically challenged had difficulty or were unable to reach them!) If we fell off, we were in a pit of screaming children and had to go back to the beginning! Another activity involved using a rope swing to get from one side of a bamboo stick that was elevated off the ground, to the platform on the other side. The catch was that if anyone knocked over the stick, or stepped off the platform, or fell into the pit of lava (aka green ketsup and rancid mustard!) EVERYONE had to go back to the beginning! So we had to work together as a team to get through. My favorite challenge was the Mohawk, which was a series of wires (4 I think) strung from trees varying lengths apart and we had to get everyone across, again by working together, and the distances kept getting longer. It was really neat though, because by that time we working so well together that we communicated well enough to make it without ANYONE falling off! We were apparently the only group to do that! It was so awesome! Oh yeah and we also did another activity called the spider web. This one was just the girls while we were waiting for the guys to come back from helping haul logs or something like that. It was really neat because the last person to go through, litterally leaped right through one of the middle spaces into the arms of those of us on the other side - it was like she was flying almost... It was really great!   Anyway My week was just so amazing! Those are just some of the highlights. I also did do a fair amount of work in the office. The first camp starts on Monday and it's not full, but that's kind of a good thing since it's the first camp and we're just getting into the new routines. I think it will be an awesome summer though!!! I'm VERY excited!
