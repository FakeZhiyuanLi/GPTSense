      People ask me what it's like to be unemployed. And there is no easy answer to describe it. It's different for everyone, but I've noticed that there are about 3 different types of unemployed people.  The 'Fuck the company and the whole fucking world'  type: Those that have never gotten over the fact that they were laid off in the first place. They are bitter and still want to talk about the goings on at the company. Day after day after day. They've also given up on looking for a job but will never tell you that. They hear that people say jobs are hard to find, etc., but they don't seem to be doing any looking themselves. The information they collect and thrive on is purely hearsay. They stay up till 3am, wake up at 11am and watch TV in between the two. These people have shitty resumes, and don't care if their resume mixes past and future tenses. They are like, "Huh? Oh really? Does that matter?" They are so bitter that they get upset when other unemployed friends get interviews, let alone a job! I think they masturbate a lot and are always exhausted.  The 'Oh my fucking god' type : This is the panicker type. Lots of anxiety. Must be online, must be looking for work at all times. Very automaton. These people set their alarms for early in the morning and pride themselves on finding a job posting first. They are all over the fucking job message boards and forums, and drive everyone else in their life batty with their 'Oh my fucking god, I don't have a job, I am a wreck' attitude. They still keep schedules and hardly ever goof off, thinking that if they do, they will lose out on some opportunity. They frantically check their voice and e-mail all the time. They go to those gay layoff parties to network, thinking it's actually gonna make a difference.  The 'Oh well, guess I'll take some classes or paint' type : You don't see too many of these people out there, but they are the ones that can actually enjoy unemployment. They spend their time boosting their professional and technical skills, frequenting the gym (thus being their healthiest in 10 years), and catching up on all those novels and magazines next to the bed. Even though they know what's going on out there in jobless land, they don't get upset about it. They feel that this time off is an 'opportunity for personal growth'. These are the type of people that might be unemployed for a long time, but it somehow doesn't make a difference. They may even turn down jobs along the way because it won't be challenging enough, while the 'oh my fucking god' type will jump at every opportunity, no matter how lame. They are people who sometimes do yoga or meditate.

      First off, HAPPY 39th BIRTHDAY to my brother. You da man, ya old bastard!  OK, so I'm sitting here, contemplating several things. First off, about a year ago, I had been totally devastated by one mean-ass bitch of an ex-girlfriend. I was drinking nightly, wasting money I didn't have, trying to find a way to cope. Lo and behold, it was to no avail. Time was definitely not on my side, but nevertheless, it passed.  Now, I have met someone who is actually compatible with me. She's not selfish, she's not a bitch, and she doesn't insist that everything goes her way. It's amazing the difference a year makes! Now I'm engaged, and the pending marriage isn't far off. So as I read through some of the engagement announcements to get an idea of what mine should say, here's what I've come up with so far...  "The engagement and forthcoming marriage of Dr. Leslie Purdy of Little Rock and Aaron Hoyt of Little Rock, formerly of Greenbrier, is being made known.  The bride-elect is a daughter of Mrs. Linda Higgs and Tommy Purdy, both of Malvern. The prospective groom is a son of Mrs. Jane Mount of Lafayette, Indiana, and Dr. Arthur Hoyt, Jr. of Wooster.  The bride-elect is a graduate of Malvern High School. She graduated from Henderson State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology. She received her masterâ€™s degree from Henderson State University in Biology Education, and her Doctorate degree from Americus University in Washington D.C. She is currently a chemistry teacher at Hall High School in Little Rock.  The prospective groom is a graduate of St. Joseph High School in Conway. He graduated from the University of Central Arkansas with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical science, and is currently working as technology coordinator for the Shirley School District.  The couple will be married in a midnight ceremony on October 31 at The Old Mill Wedding Chapel in Hot Springs. The reception will be a costume party that will precede the nuptials in a non-traditional ceremony. Only out-of-town invitations will be sent. All friends and family are invited to attend. The honeymoon will be a cruise to Nassau, Bahamas."  The ring:  urlLink    Click for the big view  The happy couple  urlLink    Click for the big view

      You know, I never really gave much of a damn about Father's Day until I became one. It was then that I realized that without fathers, there would be no chit'lins. My children both acknowledged the day, and made sure that I knew that I was thought about. It was great! So, for those of you who are lucky enough to have your dad around, make sure you acknowledge him. And for those dads out there, you have my congratulations, and a Happy Father's Day wish!  :)

      You know, there's one thing I can't stand, and that is stupid people. Stupid people without cause or reason who go blindly through life, doing all they can to try to make other's lives as pathetic and sad as their own. These same people will spout forth with comments and rhetoric that are neither intelligent nor prudent.  So, take note, stupid people--and you know who you are--you keep on with your immature and innane rantings. In the end, it is you who will end up feeling left out. It takes a special person to see past such belligerent missives, but you have met your match.

      So today is my birthday. As I sit here awaiting the 3:00pm NASCAR race, I consider a few things about birthdays. This year, my birthday isn't as festive and jovial as in past years. Unemployment has worn very thin on me, and in turn, on my pockets. If it weren't for a supportive family with a shred of pity, I would likely be sitting in a box on the street, begging for pocket change. Anyways, 37 years ago, my shiny white ass was brought into this world, and it's never been the same since!  The worst day to have a birthday on has to be a Sunday. You can't party on Sunday night, and it seems premature to do it on the preceding Saturday. I'm not one for all of the glory and shennanigans that normally take place on a birthday, although last year I ended up being carried out of the club of my choosing, as everyone and their dog bought the birthday boy a drink! Next year, I look for a Monday birthday. Yay. How fun. Monday sucks anyways, and to have a birthday on a Monday sucks really bad. I still have 3 years before the big four-oh, but it's approaching rapidly. My son graduates high school when I'm 41, and I truly believe that will be MUCH more traumatic than any 40th birthday could ever be. Ugh.  Oh, well, I guess I should quit bitching about getting older. I only have two choices--get busy living, or get busy dying. I sure as hell ain't gonna do the latter, so I guess I should get busy living. Until next time...

      Well, this past week, I had 4 interviews--each went well in its own respect. However, the one that stood out as the most promising was with the Log Cabin Democrat. Robyn Green is the current Director of Internet Services, and he has chosen to return to school after his upcoming marriage, as his bride-to-be apparently makes some serious change under the employ of Acxiom. I am very hopeful about this position, as it seems to be the most fitting to my qualifications and my abilities. I am supposed to get the "final word" Monday or Tuesday, so maybe this 7 month fuster cluck will be over soon...although it's never soon enough!  Along other lines, I recently came into contact with a former co-worker turned musical artist. It turns out that during the one month she and I worked together, the name that I chose for her (Leanne Bridges) stuck, and she will be using it professionally! How cool is that? She plans to follow the route of Evanescence star Amy Lee by playing the club/small venue scene locally in hopes that she'll be discovered. Best wishes to Leanne, as I know that you likely have a long uphill battle ahead of you. *hugs*  And finally, there's my children. The very means of my existence. They spent a week with me last week, and I learned a lot of things about them that reminded me of the inevitable--they're growing up. My son is now 14 with a voice every bit as deep as mine, and he is about as coordinated as an octopus in a hurricane. My daughter is now 11 going on 23, and the child needs to get her "little visitor" soon! She's about to drive both her mother and I crazy! She gets that whole head-and-shoulders attitude thing going, and you just want to send her thru the wall! But then you see her sweet little face, and you wonder how anyone couldn't love such a sweet thing. So, as dear old dad draws another day closer to retirement, I just look at my kids and I know what life is all about.  Until next time...

      First off, I got bored today, so I sat down and configured a new desktop theme. This one is particularly interesting and has lots of cool stuff on it. If you want to take a look...   urlLink    Click the picture for the BIG view  With that said, I find myself feeling much improved today--not because I've found work or because of anything else. It's simply because I've had my kids for the past 4 1/2 days, and it was just really nice. They've recently moved into a new "house" (read: trailer) just this month, so until the new wears off, they're enjoying their newfound territory. I know that soon enough, it will be my turn. Leslie's house will sell, and we'll be moving to Greenbrier to rent a house while we draw up the plans for the 2500 square foot Victorian that we've got in the plans.  All of this hinges, of course, on the amount of money that my not-yet-found job will provide. I keep my fingers crossed about several possibilities, but nobody was in the office today to make any decisions, so I await tomorrow. And, as soon as word comes across, the who and where will be posted here for your viewing pleasure (or displeasure, depending on who you are).  Until next time...

      It is now official--I am no longer in the ranks of the unemployed. I was hired today by the Shirley School District (www.shirleybluedevils.com) as their technology coordinator. What that encompasses is simple--anything and everything that has to do with computers, it's my duty. Along with my duties as technology coordinator, I will also be assistant basketball coach for the boys and girls teams. That's certainly not a prestigious job when you're talking about a small school like Shirley, but it is a job that I love to do.  Thank you for all of your supportive emails, phone calls and messages. The last 7 months and 8 days have been nothing short of hell. But alas, every beginning is a new beginning's end. Oh, and fuck Clear Channel.   Until next time...

      For those of you that have asked, the job with the Log Cabin Democrat fell through. It's unfortunate, as I know I could have fulfilled every aspect of the position. I know that I gave my best for this position, and as much as I wanted the job, it just wasn't in the cards for me. So, my quest continues, and life goes on.  Until next time...

       So, I'm still interviewing these days...2-3 a week...hoping that my plight will soon be over. Then, last week, I see the funniest thing I've seen in a long time. Magic 105 (actually it's Clear Channel) fires their long-time morning show host, Tommy Smith, aka "The Outlaw".      Now, before you go bashing and hating because I say this, keep in mind that these same heathens that gave Tommy Smith the axe sent me packing mere months ago, beginning a lengthy depression and social spiral to my current status. Clear Channel has reached new heights of ignorance in their zeal to be #1, and this is just another sign of that ignorance. Why would you fire a station's bread and butter, even if he's controversial and no on top as he used to be, without him, the station may well be on its way to hell.      So, fear not, faithful followers. I will be employed soon, and you will once again see the work cam back up and running. You'll also get more regular updates on here, as my life will become a bit more dynamic than what it is today--sleep, eat, crunch job boards, read classifieds, eat, watch TV...lather, rinse, repeat.      It's been a long year...

      Well, it's been over a week now, and I have to say--it's great to be back at work! I know it's not as glamorous or "prestigious" as working at Clear Channel, but the nice thing is, when that last bell rings, my day is OVER (if I want it to be). I don't have weekend or holiday work, and I am the ONLY person there that does what I do. I'm the #1 man for the network, and man, is that a fucked up network!  It appears as though my predecessor was somewhat of a hack, and rather than fix things the right way, he would use duct tape and paper clips to hold things together just long enough to get approval from the superiors. I've found these truths to be no more literal than in the very computer that controls the entire campus--internet, email, network--it was literally held together with duct tape, and had paper clips holding in the CD drive and the floppy drive. What kind of shit is that?  So I have my work cut out for me. I have to clean up the mess that Hackboy made, as well as get all 65 of the student lab computers up and running. Oh, and did I mention that I have exactly one week to complete the mission? Bah...no worries. If someone like him can do it, I know I can do it in my sleep with both hands tied behind my back.  So, that's the report for now. Check back next time, as there will be some nifty gadgets to show...if I can get them to work! Until next time...
