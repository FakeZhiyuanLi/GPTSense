      In today's news of Nicole's life...  (this is a gossipy bit about my love life, so if you don't care about that stuff, then go read  urlLink Quinn's blog ...)  So... for those of you who know me, you know that all through college I kept professing "I LOATHE blind dates, I HATE being set up...".  I, have, however, very recently come to the realization that my incessant complaint of "poor me, I never meet anyone and I don't have time for a boyfriend/dating" was due to the fact that I wasn't open to the idea of meeting someone (in any way that you might meet someone to become friends or date or whatnot.  (I know ... "DUH Nicole...")).  Thus leading to me not meeting anyone I would consider dating... or rather me not considering dating anyone I met = vicious cycle of me ranting about "all the good ones are taken" --> keeping horrendously busy to prevent myself from being self-pitying --> not having time to be social --> not meeting anyone --> back to beginning.  In any event... after this realization, I started talking to my close friends about this and telling people... "hey if you know anyone I might like to meet, I'd love to meet them..." with the intention of not just finding guys for the purpose of dating them, but to make new friends --  no really, I'm being serious!   (I have a very small/lovely/great/close-knit social circle, and I would LOVE to expand upon the great friends I have now.  You can never have too many friends, and you never know... someone you meet and become friends with rather than dating might know someone you might want to date!)  To make a long story much longer... once I TOLD people I would like to be introduced to guys/set up... All of a sudden everyone is all "Oh, I know this great guy...".  Made me wonder how long they were going to wait before bringing Mr. Great Guy up in conversation or if they were at all!  If I had know all it took was to ASK for people to introduce you to nice guys they know, I would have asked a long time ago!  Grrr.  It is so unbelievably difficult to get past the social stigma of being single and needing help meeting guys.  You just feel like, "well, if I ask for help, then I'm really a loser/desparate/lost cause."  Not exactly the mindset to make one jump off the couch and head out and "mingle" in the wide world of singledom.  Besides that...I don't want to leave meeting guys up to chance encounters in some dimly light replication Irish pub.  I mean, it is easy to make the leap to "hey, I have something in common with this person" if you meet them doing something you both like, or know the same people, etc.  Which of course makes it easier to make the leap to "I'd like to spend time with this person/date them and get to know them".  I'm sick of all this barroom flirtation, dating game, "The Rules", behavioral limitations... I just wanna be me, and meet someone who likes me for being me 24/7, no matter what mood/personality I'm in at a given moment.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  I think I will make it my personal goal to frustrate every person who tries to impose the "LAWS OF DATING in MODERN SOCIETY" on my love life by doing it MY way so that I can meet the kind of guys I want to date, date the way I want to date, and not have any regrets or lost opportunities for friendships along the way.  So bring it on ... I'm ready for whatever life's got in store...   GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR .

      Yes, I am THAT bored at work...reading Monica's blog an stumbling across interesting things...somehow though, I don't see myself as Spring.

      I found my poetry book.  It was exactly where I last put it -- under my desk, in the little space where your legs go when you sit down to write or type.  I opened it and tried to remember if any of them had been published since I wrote them and I hadn't marked it down (I keep track, because for me, it's a big deal -- being an amateur who isn't a "real" writer since I'm a scientist.)  I know there's a few that aren't marked as published that have been -- I just have to find the book I published in to double check which ones.  My poems are very similar -- lots of angst and unrequited love and independence and other such nonsense -- so often I can't remember which one is which.  I still am blown away by the idea that some complete stranger read my poetry and decided it needed to be put in a book in a library for all posterity.  I would have been happy for them to stay in my little $1 composition book, between the black and white cardboard and binding tape, under my desk, in the little space where your legs go when you sit down to write or type.  So, like I said, I found my poetry book.    And I found the first blank page in it after the stuff I've written in it already.  And it was SCREAMING to be filled.  But there wasn't anything to be said.  So I closed it and stuffed the whole thing back under my desk, in the little space where your legs go when you sit down to write or type.  I'll fill the page another day.

      Holidays... and I am "seeing-lots-of-people"d out!  You have to understand this is with good reason.  I have a HUGE family.  No really.  BIG.  My Dad's side only (17 people minus 2 who didn't come) were all at our house day after Christmas.  Then we went on Saturday to my Mom's cousin's house for her side, which all total is about 80 people... and they were ALL there.  So um, yea.  I love my family -- they are as obnoxious as they come, so I fit right in and have a grand ol' time whenever we all get together.  Plus quite a few (including my grandma from Florida) came into town special for this Christmas at the last minute, so it was kinda chaotic but very fun.  Santa was also very good to me... we got the WHOLE DAY just my mom, dad, sis, me and the dog to ourselves -- so we had steak dinner (which takes about 15 mintues to prepare) and lots of goofing off.  It was a nice break from the usual "we're having family over" routine.  Different from the usual, which used to be something I had a problem with on holidays.  It always forces you to face the fact that as things change, people change, traditions change, it means you are growing up.  That's a scary thing.  But I'm learning too that if you embrace the change, the differences, it can make for a great and unique adventure every time.

      Visiting your parents in the middle of nowhere oft leads to desperate grasps at things to do at 12 AM.  Like taking this quiz for instance...    You are a Gender Nazi.  Your boundary-crossing lifestyle inspires awe in your friends and colleagues.  Or maybe they're just scared you will kick their asses for using gender-specific language.  Either way, the wife-beater helps.    urlLink   What kind of postmodernist are you!?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Who knew I was a post-modernist?

        Christmas Traditions...     T-minus 24 hours til Christmas.  Yikes!  Hope the dog doesn't find the presents I hid...never know with her.  It's bad enough the border collie in her has developed this habit of "herding" the family when I'm home.  Very annoying when you are trying to AVOID being in the same room as them.  Three and a half hours on the free way, multiple rain squalls, and a half a tank of gas later... I'm at my parents house squabbling with my younger sister over how to arrange our little "toy town" and where the heck Joseph has gone (the Joseph figurine has been missing from my mom's nativity set since before I could remember... as usual we decided to use the shepard in his stead...).  The tree is trimmed (thanks to yours truly, there is nary a bald spot on our 6 foot synthetic tree), and my tummy is full and not getting any emptier (mom has STOCKED our house with cookies, dad's  urlLink kolachi   has taken over the counter, and leftovers abound in the fridge.  Gotta love visiting the rents -- you always eat well!).  And the best part -- all I have to do tomorrow is make pizza and get myself to Mass on time.  Christmas ROCKS!  p.s. If anyone can find a picture of kolachi, I'll put a link... but for now you non-Slovaks will have to settle for the recipe and the knowledge that YOU'RE MISSIN' OUT!

      Snow.  Again.  blech.  :-P  Meetings, meetings, and more meetings.  Today, I went to a seminar (read "meeting"), then to lunch (again, read "meeting", but a FUN meeting!), and now have a "meeting" with my experimental bacteria.  Not that my  urlLink little monsters  will have much to say.  I mean, they're just bacteria.  But still.  I will also have to get up and "talk" to them very early tomorrow morning so they don't go out of control in their warm little petri dishes.  I have this weird thing about talking to them to get them to grow, or not grow, or to make sure the DNA I put into them gets in and STAYS there.  I mean, they have scientific evidence that it helps plant growth, so why not  E. coli ?  (Betcha didn't think you'd be getting microbiology lessons today, did ya?)  Six days till Christmas and my shopping is still not done.  Thank goodness for  urlLink Target.com  ....at least then I can head to wherever I need to go to get the gift with a vague idea of what I want to buy for person X.  But I don't think I will buying any  urlLink Brazil nuts ...even though they are yummy.

      Once again, I have woken up bleary-eyed and somewhat peeved that it's time to get out of bed.  So I hit the snooze... which ultimately results in my being "just on time" for my 9 AM meeting.  Putting me in a  BAD  mood.  But the meeting was good.  So were the bagels (MAN I love bagels...).  So I'm sore, I'm tired (but I'm full -- MAN I love bagels...), and I go to check my email.  And GRADES are posted.  Uh oh.  I took two classes this past quarter -- one was a seminar that I had to give, and I know I got an A on that.  Which leaves the only unknown as my Proteins Biochemistry class -- two exams (midterm and final).  Nothing else.  8:30 AM class (so of course, I'm consistently late EVERY day unless we had an exam or I had to pull something from an incubation before that time, since I am incapable of getting up early and being on time for anything.)  My thought process:  "Do I really want to know how I did?" "What if I did badly?" "I wonder how much he scaled it... I did good on the midterm, so I wonder how much I can get away with stinking on the final..." "CRAP!" "yikes... that was a hard final." "I FAILED! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"  So I pulled up my grades... messed around a bit to find the quarter I need to look at...  (And of course this past quarter isn't showing, because that would just be bass ackwards... THIS COMING quarter is up.  HELOOO... Registrar?  Um... grades haven't been posted for winter yet!)  I GOT AN A!  :-)  Yay.  MAN I love bagels.  And MAN I love A's.  But I'm still tired...darn WT and FC and another friend have conspired against me to keep me up late playing Monopoly AGAIN.  At least I got home and slept in my own bed for a bit...= TIRED.  Yet elated, frustrated, scared, lonely, isolated, happy, excited, content, anxious, worried.  (I'm learning to get in touch with my feelings this week -- it is humanly possible to feel multiple things at once.)    Internal struggle ensues (something like WWE cage match perhaps?).  Striking a balance is a very difficult thing -- between time for me and time for my friends.  MUST... DECIDE... PLANS... FOR... THIS EVENING...  How about for right now I go focus on what I'm really supposed to be doing now?    ...WORK...

      I will openly admit to being a bit obsessive-compulsive.  Take this blog for instance.  Let's just say that if there were a "track changes" feature I could enable, there would be so much red on the screen that you might think you've accidentally stumbled upon a website for some poor chap's surgery photos (don't laugh... I had a friend who had surgery not so long ago and now they can actually make ... you will not believe this... a  DVD  of the whole process).  In any event... it's been something like this.  Nicole decides to change something.  Nicole changes ONE CHARACTER of the html code (yes, I'm learning this. Maybe I'll learn enough to actually get some stuff to WORK...).  Nicole is not pleased with the result in the preview.  Repeat 216841534168416874651986541586416954189652168x10^(infinity) times.  Nicole is pleased and picks something else to change.  Repeat 1,232,423,519,1661641887984165879863549215891x10^(infinity) times.  (I know the commas aren't in the right place.  That's not important.  It's the utter THEORETICAL HUGENESS of the number that is the important concept here.)  I have to say though, that I am proud that I successfully found code for and changed my shoutbox code to timestamp entries. This I am very proud of. Now I am working on alignment.  Can you tell my life is pretty boring right now? I'm half way to my weekend before my holiday... this is how bored I am -- I've broken down my countdown til Christmas into STAGES...and am attempting to find something to focus on. Unsuccessfully. This is probably because I've been up VERY late for a couple nights -- playing Monopoly, eating popcorn, drinking (cheap) wine with WT and Mr. "400 calories" boy -- who, by the way, is going to just have to live with my abbreviating that from now on as FC because, well, because I can make that executive decision since this is MY blog and typing out 400 calories is too much work for my fingers and mind (I cannot, despite the fact that I can on occasion and without too much error type about 60 words per minute of text without looking at the keyboard, type numbers without looking at the keyboard).  So lack of sleep has DEFINITELY been a factor.  And of course, my inability to say NO to people... and my need to "mother" them.  And a lot of other stuff that I'm not going to get into.  Mostly those three.  So because of this...my list of self-imposed things to do has grown, despite my adamancy that I will have ME time over my holiday from classes.  So I have Christmas presents to make (I'm not going to tell you what... you'll just have to wait and see...), three books I REALLY do want to read, work, sleep need, chocolate needs, and oh yea, cleaning my room (believe it or not, scientists are messy).  And thus, my ME time has flown out the window and turned into "prior committment time" (I think I must have been committed to an institution in a past life and not had any control, since I feel such a need to do EVERYTHING I can to have control over something...).  Luckily, though Mother Nature has way of telling you to SLOW DOWN when you need admonishment for being too busy -- it's called feeling crummy.  Which is how I feel right now.  So I think tonight is going to consist of me, curled up in my favorite blanket, on my couch, with a book and the TV.  So there "prior committments."

      You know, you would think, in this day and age of fighting for freedoms and whatnot, that you might not have to send an email like this to your friends when you start a blog.  I guess I didn't.   But I did.  Cause I don't want to be sued... or hated... or the cause of mid-twenties angst for anyone... I guess it goes with the whole "mutal respect" thing.  Though apparently my one friend has lost some respect for me now that I've started it.  Comes with the territory of living by one's own rules I suppose.  I shoulda been born an Emerson.   Hey all... just wanted to drop you a line and let you know that I've started a blog... a web-log.  It's like an online journal, except it won't be including the extremely explicit details of my "misadventures" that my actual journal might (like who I kissed last time I went out to the bar... hahah -- gotcha.  I didn't kiss anybody!    And I haven't been out to bar in a while... graduate school keeps you busy like that...).     In any event... YOU CAN STOP LAUGHING AT MY CYBER-NERDINESS NOW PLEASE AND THANK YOU!!!!... it's started, it's not so hot -- yet -- and it's a work in progress.  I will hopefully, sooner than later, have a shoutbox up where people can post comments on what I have written.  Basically, it will be me... being my hyper-analytical self that I always am.  So if you see me regularly, it might not be horrendously amusing.  If you don't see me regularly, it might be an amusing insight into what I'm up to and will aid in the slow extinction of the dreaded mass email event I so loathe to do.   I also wanted to put out a disclaimer about it for those of you I do see on a regular basis.  I realize that many people are very private, and so I don't want to offend anyone inadvertantly by mentioning them.  So, I'm going to mostly stick to insights and what not, rather than details about what person X did to person Y and why person W was crying on the phone to me at 3 AM.  That being said -- I might occasionally talk about my very few and somewhat nonexistent social activites, including the people that are with me when I participate in them (but no negative/gossipy stuff about anyone... I am not one to badmouth others.).  So, if you don't want your name mentioned, please let me know and I will make a point not to use your name if you so desire.  Or I can just use your initial, first name, nickname no one else knows, whatever.  LET ME KNOW what you would prefer.   You should also know, that my blog is editable... that means I can go and change it.  So if you see something on there you think needs changed (I'm a horrific speller on occasion... or if I put something on there you would like to see burned if it were actually in paper print), throw me an email.   And I'm being smart about this for my own and your safety too... no email addresses on the blog, no address or phone numbers that might attract stalkers or spam... just my random thoughts, rantings and musings...ladynicole.blogspot.com.

      Um... has anyone else noticed the hypnotic pull of the President's website when you access it from the Republican National Committee's site? (See links at left... this only happens if you access the President's site from the RNC website, not if you go to the White House site directly...).  It's almost as though they think that if you were to see anything else.... hmmmmm.... that you might form an INDEPENDENT OPINION!  Horrors of horrors!  Voters who think for themselves!  In a campaign year no less!

      Arrrg.  Mondays stink.  What better day to start something fun to take your mind off the stinkiness?  So I'm starting this because:  A) I'm lazy.  B)  My friends hate mass emails.  C)  "And now for something completely different..."  Okay, firstly -- I would not recommend devoting a whole weekend to carbo-loading.  Not fun.  Well, it's fun while you're doing it, despite the fact that you know 48 hours from then that the pounds will be sitting solidly on your hips.  But the Monday after -- not so fun.  My stomach is full of bats.  And spiders.  Yuck.  But it was done in good company ("Wild Thing"... here after WT and my guy friend who since this was posted has asked to be referred to as "400 Calories" -- I'm not going to explain here, if you know them, you know why or else don't really want to know...) with good drinks and food and games (I think we started a Monopoly game that will never end -- cut-throat Monopoly.  I knew there was a reason Mom always had to put a stop to sis and I playing it for extended periods of time in one day...).

      When will all the freakin' snow stop!  It never ends... last night, then again this morning.  And, oh goody...  urlLink freezing rain is coming !  Someone please buy me a ticket to Barbados, or Key West, or Cancun or SOMEWHERE WARM WITH NO SNOW!!!  ANYWHERE!  It's 9 degrees Farenheit... feels like -3 degrees.  MINUS THREE.  All I know is I'm cold inside the building.  And now I'm going back out...gotta go bundle up... speaking of which... Here is my list for the week:   Top Ten Reasons to Ohio Winters Stink  (in no particular order)  1)  It's otherwise referred to as "120 days of darkness." 2)  Snow.  Lots of it.  When you least expect it. 3)  Wind.  Especially in Central and Northwest Ohio where it's FLAT. 4)  Lake effect snow.  Even worse than snow. 5)  Ice.  Everywhere, on your car, on your sidewalk, under the snow. 6)  Freezing rain. 7)  Lack of people who actually know how to drive in snow/ice/freezing rain.  Again, mainly afflicting Northwest and Central Ohio. 8)  There's no getting out of it.  The worst weather is not over holidays, so there is no vacation/break to be had.  Even if you could get time off, the planes are difficult to get off the ground in all this mess! 9)  Falling/nearly falling on your butt. 10)  Having to allow an extra 10 minutes to get bundled and debundled every where you go.

      So I've decided that today is all about me...  I went to yoga for the first time in about 6 months.  I found a great place nearby ( urlLink Wise Ways ) that has Saturday morning classes -- I loved taking yoga, especially Saturday mornings.  Made me feel refreshed after a long week, and ready to go on the weekend.  I am doing my nails.  Again, something I've not done for a long time -- used to be something I did weekly or semi-weekly.  My little "I'm taking care of myself" ritual.  I'm even doing my toes... :-D  I'm putting off doing laundry.  It can wait.  I'm going to bed early!  Of course, early for me is 11 PM, but still, going to bed early for me.  I had for dinner one of my favorite things -- Jose Ole` mini tacos!  I know, I know... so bad for you.  Anything frozen that comes from box that you cook in the oven is bad for you on principle.  But they are sooooo yummy with sour cream, salsa, lettuce, onion, and cheese.  :-D  I'm doing what I want to do this weekend.  I stopped letting choosing my Saturday night activity become all about pleasing everyone else, and let it be about what I would have fun doing.  So I've got plans with an out of town friend.  Strangely, none of my friends I turned down seems to have a problem with it.  I'm going to have to start letting my own will be the guiding force more often!

       Backstory to the Brush-off   Brr.  HVAC still not fixed in the lab.  So our lab flooded again today.  So we had water everywhere.  It even came in through the sprinkler, which set off the fire alarm, which called not one, but THREE ladder trucks from the Columbus City Fire Department to our building.  Mind you, I'm a fan of a guy in uniform, but when he's carrying a big fire ax and telling me to get out of the building, it's a little disconcerting.  And having to evacuate TWICE because we came out and went back in, before the firemen turned off the alarm, and then had to come back OUT when they showed up.  Very distracting, not conducive to work at all.  Speaking of which, I'm in the lab late again today.  Of course, that is what happens when I stop for lunch and an appointment before 5 PM.  So I'm staying late to compensate.   Plus, I can't go a day without getting at least a small thing done, even if it is just a maxi prep.  I should post grades for my students as well, which I think will take off some pressure when I have more papers to grade and more grades to post tomorrow.  And more reading.  Sometimes, the bulk of the "THINGS TO DO" pile gets incredibly overwhelming...but then I remind myself to make a list, take baby steps, and it will all get done and I can cross things off the list as they disappear into the past.  I've reverted back to cocoon-mode.  That or the Super Flirt butterfly died.  I hate to think of myself as dead, especially if I'm a butterfly.  So I think we shall just say I've gone into hibernation.    Partially, I'm just being stubborn.  All of a sudden, every one of my friends has decided NOW is the time to fight cabin fever... so it's non-stop "let's go do this," "let's go do that."  Not that I mind.  I actually like not being the social director.  And it is nice to be included all the time (versus the social outcast I was at my high school).  But it seems like the more they call, the more they ask me to do stuff, the more I just want to sit at home.  Remember that "I don't wanna do what you want me do" attitude from age 7?  Mine is coming back to the surface.  That initial experience of the phase was pretty short for me, after coming to the realization that sitting in my closet pouting wasn't going to make my parents allow me to do what  I  wanted to do.  So it's back now, because I have control over where I go, what I do, and who I hang out with.  I can now actually accomplish something by being stubborn and stupid and just going against the grain.  Of course, I'm not really accomplishing anything but isolating myself by giving excuses to those party people who, for some reason I will  never   understand, keep calling me.  So the real question is, why do I still not want to go out all the time?  That my friends, I'm working on figuring out.  And I'm getting closer to the answer.  But at least for now, I think that answer is between me and my brain.  So to use a cliche...  "just rest assured, it's not you... it's me."

       sung haltingly to a made up tune...  OOOOOO.... it's cold, it's cold, it's very, very cold.  I cannot feel my fingers or my toes... IT'S COLD!!!!  Yes, my lab is starting to freeze over.  After about a week of it being tropical-paradise hot, it is now Arctic-Circle cold.  They turned off the heat, and pipes froze and busted, so it's also "flooding."  So we've developed an evacuation plan ... if someone yells "RUN!" head for the exits!  Level 2 snow emergency in Columbus.  As far as I'm concerned, work shouldn't be a necessity.  Granted, the roads are not all that messy.  The sidewalks are lethally icy though... and no salt to be found on campus here at OSU.  It's "go to class at risk of your neck" today.  And I think it actually may be warmer outside than in here (my lab) since I can feel my fingers there and not here.  Technically, that means it shouldn't be icy out there.  But it is.  I think it must be topsy-turvy day and no one told me.  I hate Mondays.  In any event...it's 7 PM.  I'm still at work, after coming back from a seminar to finish up my experiment of the day.  I have some other things to do, in order to have something to do tomorrow as well, which I probably should get to...  But I am going to write a few more lines.  Haha... it's my creative brain.  Can't resist an empty page.  New on the social life front... I actually went out and DID something this week, despite being busy with grading and reading and grading some more.  I reached my saturation point on Thursday night and just put it all away and started goofing off on my PC.  And, as chance would have it, one of my friends called.  Now, understand, not all my friends are "let's go do something" people during the week.  But this one... whom, I've previously referred to as 400, is.  So my side-long comment of "I don't have anything to do" was instantly snapped up as opportunity to drag me out of my apartment, as my friends are apt to do when they can.  So I ended up first at the coffee shop, then at Spagio's when the coffee shop closed.  Then we stood outside talking after Spagio closed for another half an hour.  This was, mind you, on Thursday, when it was about, oh, negative bajillion degrees outside.  Finally we both had the good sense to go home when I realized my ears were numb.  But still... fun.  I'm back into social butterfly mode after being dragged out a few times this week... I may just be ready to actually "go out."  When I do...look out boys, here comes Super Flirt!  And now...  I'm going to make snow angels and snow balls... watch your back if you know what's good for you... ;-)

      So... for those you not in Ohio.  The weather STUNK this weekend.  Freezing rain, sleet, snow, regular rain -- slush and ice everywhere.  My car was coated at least four times and scraped at least five times to get into it again.  Because, even on a day like that, the proverbial show must go on.  Saturday used to be my day to do nothing... how that changed, I'll never know.  Now, this week, it has turned into a LONG list of duties, both student-oriented and Nicole-oriented:  1)  Scan in almost a dozen COLOR graphs for my lab students...  my "kids."  I do too much for them.  I should have just given the graphs to my supervisor and asked her to do it.  But I figured, "hey, I'm going to be the lab on Saturday anyway... so why not spend some of my 'I need something to do while I wait for my experiment to run' time scanning things."  2)  Finish up two experiments from yesterday -- which is going to take me a while.  3)  Laundry.  4)  Checkbook.  5)  Go measure the couch wildthing has so graciously offered me.  It will, I believe, fit in the-world's-smallest-two-bedroom-apartment (my apartment), but the question is whether or not it will fit through my  door  to get it into the apartment.  6)  Spend some "quality ME time" at Barnes and Noble -- did I mention I got a $10 gift card from the program for which I'm teaching?  I participated as a "panelist" for a training seminar -- which a) I love to do anyway and b) included free pizza (from my favorite pizza shop).  So the gift card was a wholely unnecessary bonus.  Not that I'm complaining.  I love B&N.  Now I can go BUY something instead of staring longingly at books I want but cannot afford and should not buy.  7)  Clean.  Everything.  In every way possible.  I'm living in the messiest apartment ever.  Probably has something to do with the fact that it's also, quite possibly, the smallest-apartment-ever-to-be-inhabited-by-two-people-simultaneously.  And the fact that one of those two people is me ("the-worst-packrat-ever") doesn't help much.  But I'm slowly throwing stuff away... at the same time, though, I aquire a new couch.  That new couch pretty much takes up the space the stuff I am throwing away used to take up.  In any event... one of my things to do is CLEAN, not purge.  8)  Read.  Two chapters of "The Moral Animal" by Robert Wright, roughly 10 abstracts, three papers (multiple times, once I pick three out of the abstracts),  roughly 6 different books I'm trying to read for fun/personal growth, and email.  My eyes hurt already.  9)  Post office run.  I have two packages that should have been mailed last week.  Now that it is after the post-office has closed, I have two options.  I can wait til Monday, or I can go to the 24 hour post-office.  Ah, the benefits of living in a big city.  They have things like that.  Even in Ohio.   The good news is that items 2-6 actually were finished.  Number 1 was just finished yesterday, as was 8.  However, I still have yet to motivate myself to do 7 and 9.  Most likely, they'll get done tonight, but who knows.  In any event, I had a productive weekend.  So on a completely different topic -- cabin fever.  I'm in a funk.  I need SUN!  I feel like a bad houseplant -- you know, the ones who are always sort of brownish and wilted?  Gaah.  This overcast sky crap needs to end.  And today, it's freezing rain to boot.  So yeah.  It feels like even the weather hates me at this point.  I think I'll move to California after grad school.  Southern California.  My house plants are faring better -- at least they get plant food to perk them up in the winter!  Now they are growing like crazy, even with the lack of sun.  I think I'll be okay on the sun front, as it seems sunny so far today.  It is still, however, FREAKIN' COLD!  But sunny.  I can handle cold if the sun is out.  Plus, I bought a book of Emily Dickinson at B&N the other day, so I have passage upon passage of reflection upon nature and life to get me by and help me out in my reflections.  Emily Dickinson = Yay!  I've realized there are a few prized things that make me so excited/happy that all I can do is either a) say "Yay!" b) dance for joy (literally) c) or laugh so hard I end up snorting.  A short list:  -- chocolate -- S and Liz (don't know why...just in general, they make me happy) -- really good mac and cheese -- Michelle when she's doing her "dance" -- having something turn out correctly at lab -- a student "getting" something I am teaching -- Sean's Monty Python impressions -- Sunny days -- a good sturdy thunderstorm -- being at the beach/on the water   Now if I could figure out why, it may give me further insight into my neurosis... since they would probably be the opposite...hmmm....

      So my week has been going something like this...   Monday ... ew.   Monday ... woke up with migraine... ew.   Tuesday ...woke up with migraine... double ew.  But good discussion in my recitation section.  EVERYONE talked.  And there are 20 students, so that says something I think.  Yay.  Good sign.   Wednesday  ... LONG day.  Yucko.  Made stuffed cabbage after work after calling my parents from the grocery store for the recipe.  I love my cell phone.  And I FINALLY made myself sit down and work on balancing my checkbook/reconciling my bank statements with Quicken.  Oh, I love Quicken.  "God, bless this..." my great friend Sean for putting in on my computer...  THANK YOU!!!!  (Betcha don't know where that incomplete reference is from!)    Quicken is great because a) you can DOWNLOAD your bank info into it instead of wasting time entering it yourself (course, I still go through and edit the categories/check payees) or you can enter it yourself, then download and make sure it reconciles!  b) It automatically puts your entries in order.  SO if you forget to enter something for a week, it will still appear in the register in the correct spot... and not mess up your running balance!  Yay!  No white out necessary.  :-)  Quicken's a beautiful thing...I just want to say that I'm fascinated by the feature that allows you to plan how to pay off your credit cards.  Haven't re-evaluated that lately, but probably should since I've been attempting to conquer that particular demon.  Part of my resolution when I started a new bank account was to keep balancing my checkbook regularly, which I haven't been...but you know, it is one of those things that just takes time.  Time I don't always want to give myself to take care of my own business.  That's a whole other self-image/esteem issue there...  but anyway.  I got something done Wednesday.   Thursday ... today.  Not too far into the day yet.  Teaching lab this afternoon, which takes a huge CHUNK of bench time away.  But that's okay, since my I'm trouble-shooting today and tomorrow before I can actually accomplish anything.  Problems with supplies...grrr.  And I don't want to jeopardize the experiment by using faulty "ingredients."  So I think my "stuff I get done today" will mainly be finishing my checkbook tonight.  I'm not going to let it go for a really long time before I worry about it.  I WILL balance it monthly.  I can only imagine what my one friend (who's an accountant) would say if he knew exactly how long I went without balancing my checkbook on my last account.  I don't even want to think about what my mom would say... though, come to think of it, I told her and she didn't say much of anything.  Eh...::: shoulder shrug ::: Nothing I can do about other people's opinions anyway!  Also... Have you ever woken up with an injury?  I woke up with a pinched nerve in my left shoulder.  I can't turn my head too far left.  I can't use my left arm to lift.  It hurts.  ::: tears up :::  And I can't really do anything except load up on pain killers, which I think I'm going to do right now...hopefully the rest of today will not be overwhelmed by my inability to MOVE.

      Oiy.  What a week.  I am SOOOOO... T...i...r...e...d.  I didn't know it was possible to get 8 hours sleep and still feel exhausted.  It's 6 PM on a Friday and I'm still at work.  I know I sound like a glutton for punishment, but I'm motivated by the fact that I will have MORE to do next week that might prevent me from getting as much done as I'd like to of my own work.  My TA duties have begun again.  Good, because I love to teach.  Bad, because it's hard to juggle being a student, a researcher, and a teacher all at the same time.  But I keep reminding myself of why (because I want to be a professor) and the rewards of my teaching duties (the "lightbulb effect" when a student "gets" something).  Plus this quarter a) I'm also teaching a lab, so I get to do some of the hands on stuff as well and b) the recitation is discussion based, rather than review based.  So good stuff, good stuff.  The cold I got this week is lingering... I hate being sick.  I've spent the majority of this week denying that I am ill and need to sleep/take meds/slow the heck down.  So I'm more tired/more sick/more worn out than I should be.  I took some meds today though and they are helping -- my stubbornness has worn down the more ill I become.  Not wanting to eat from all the nausea (caused by yucky cold drainage in my stomach) started to hint that I was sick and not just tired.  But I think falling asleep on my couch last night watching an historical movie (one of my favorite genres) hit home the point to my brain -- "you are sick."  My whole denial of illness thing probably comes from my conception that I can't ask for help... "I MUST BE PERFECT!"  And being sick is something you can hide or ignore... to a point... to maintain the outward appearance of perfection.  Plus, I hate having to take any sort of medication -- it's incovenient, I'm afraid someday I'll become tolerant of it, the side effect, etc.  So there are other reasons, but mostly me just being stubborn and not wanting to be "imperfect."  But darn it... I am human.  Nasty microbes... why can't they find somewhere else to live!?  If everyone would just  urlLink wash their hands  the world would be a much cleaner place!

Yesterday was the longest day in the history of the world -- first day of class, first day of two new people at work, issues, issues, issues, minor drama (I AM SO  NOT  the drama queen... but it keeps following me around darn it!).  Ew.  I don't have anything to post really.  My head is swimming with stuff, but um... yea.  Ow.  I think I pulled my brain.  :-(  Haha... I'm so funny.  Oh yes, just classic I tell you!  I don't even have enough energy to find a decent link to keep you happy... just go to Google -->.

      I've still not recovered completely from New Year's Eve.  I have, however, decided it is my favorite holiday despite that fact.  :-D  I mean after all, what's not to like -- it's an excuse to act completely stupid, drink (if you need it to act stupid), not drink (if you can be stupid sober and prefer to play designated driver to keep your friends safe), and just hang out and have fun.  You don't have to buy presents.  You get to be LOUD!  You are given license to kiss and/or hug your friends as much as you want... or if you don't want to, that's also fine.  It's an opportunity to be completely open to opportunity, to your friends, to new beginnings, and wrapping up lose ends.  You can let go of the old and welcome the new, make resolutions (if you have to -- I prefer not to plan that far ahead, unless it's my social calendar...), or clean house.  I remember when I was in my early teens and high school, I had this routine of cleaning my room on New Year's Eve.  Mainly, it was because after a few hours of revelling, I would get bored with waiting for the New Year to ring in, and I would need something to do.  And my room was usually trashed especially badly that time of year from the holidays.  So I would spend HOURS just cleaning, sorting, putting things away.  And it was great, because I always started the year with clean room (and a resolution to keep it that way, to keep my life uncluttered with extra worries and things).  It was a way of wiping the slate clean of my old "baggage."  So last night, I started cleaning.  Now I have my whole apartment to clean, and it's not just for me -- I have my sis moving in temporarily in the next week and am trying to accomodate her as well.  But it's still the same idea of "cleansing."  I love New Year's.  :-D

      Found this in my inbox (I mailed it to myself before I had my blog to put it on...).  Thought it would be an appropriate way to relate how my New Year's Eve was... I totally lived up to molecular make up!      You are glucose. People feed off of you. You are sweet, caring, and a source of energy for everyone around you. You can inspire others with your creativity and depth, and you can keep people alive when in times of famine. People love you...or at least the way you taste.    urlLink   Which Biological Molecule Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I don't want to write anymore details about New Year's Eve.  Grr.  All I will give you is a general idea of what went on...cause I promised myself I wouldn't use this as gossip central!  It was a lot of running around like a chicken with my head cut off, because I had a friend in from out of town, another friend whom I had to help win a bet (we won, but the other guy is reneging -- SO not COOL!), HAD to make it to a party to hear a friend sing with his band, and HAD to make it to yet ANOTHER party to hang with my friends and watch the ball drop.  Suffice it to say, it was not boring (like last year, when I sat at home by myself and watched it on TV... hence me overcompensating this year...).  Haven't yet fully processed everything that happened last night because it was so CRAZY BUSY and happening all at once.  Very much like my weekends in college were on occasion.  I'm reminiscing...good night, I feel old now...  I think I'll go do something productive.  But before I do... here's my New Year's toast -- "To good friends and new beginnings...".  HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!

      Working like a dog to get stuff done.  Grading like a fiend to get exams graded.  Going to bed as soon as I get home tonight (which probably won't be for a while yet).  Hoping y'all will still love me for slacking.  Not blogging like I should to get the aforementioned activities done.  New plan:  Will blog once a week (Saturday morning) before yoga, so that I can truly shed all my stress emotionally and physically, at least once a week.  This will also prevent blogging from taking horrendously large amounts of time away from obligations during the work week/school week.  Hopefully both reasons will make me more productive in all aspects of my life.  Sincerely apologizing to my journalism friends for the gratuitous use of fragments in this post -- even though it is with artistic license (to emphasize my true lack of time by demonstrating I don't even have the time to write in complete sentences at this point in my life) and, therefore, is not grammatically incorrect.  ;-)  Signing off...

      Hmmm... let's just say that Wednesday (after my post) and Thursday were busy.  So I was running around, minding my own business driving back from Michael's and Meijer and Pier 1 Imports (my three top favorite stores of the moment), on my way (ironically enough) to pick up S and give her a ride home, as her car was in the shop.  And I start hearing this "thump thump thump" -- really quiet, making me worry about  urlLink Izzy  (keep in mind, mine is dark metallic green and a 2001 model) and then I think, "maybe it's just the road."  I pick up S, and we are about 5 minutes from where we started, and the "thump thump thump" sound starts again, and it's louder and faster this time.  And we both say... maybe we should pull over.  And I say "I bet I have a flat tire," because after the busy day I had, it would figure that such a thing would happen on top of all of it, when I have another person in the car with me.  And it's FLAT.  So I call AAA (I LOVE AAA!), and they say, "oh, it'll be LESS than 45 minutes."  Greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat.  But it ended up being pretty fun.  S and I had a good, oh 30 minute or so long, conversation.  Which, anymore (through my fault) is something we rarely do.  So it ended up being Quality Flat Tire Time = QFTT.  So I took it this morning to get it fixed, on my way to work/school.  Took all of 10 minutes and $16 (including tax).  AND, as a bonus, the mechanic who fixed it at the Firestone garage near my apartment was pretty cute.  :-D  I  might have to get flat tires more often...  6:30 PM on a Friday, and I'm still at work.  Waiting for my gel to run... gonna get some grading done while that is going,once I sign off from this post.  Thankfully, this week, it's multiple choice/single answer fill-in questions for the lab practical.  BUT another exam coming up, so that will be a horrendous job in a week.  But I'm not going to think about that now.  I'm just going to focus on the work at hand.  Or at least try to.  Might prove difficult, as I've got other stuff (including but not limited to Cute Mechanic Boy...haha!) on my brain at the moment.  Goodnight I hate my attention span...

      Firstly, if you noticed GW Bush ads up above... that is TOTALLY not my doing.  I am firmly anti-Bush (which, unfortunately, is a source of friction between some friends and I, but hey... it's the USA -- you are entitled to my opinion/interpretation of the facts).  Google just puts random stuff there after running some sort of search on my posts.  I dunno how it works.  Don't really care.  But I do think it is hilarious how badly they match my personality sometimes... just thought I'd give you that to chew on briefly while I'm wating for my incubation time to run out...  My wine basket is coming together.  I volunteered to put together a basket of wine and wine-related "supplies" - bascially whatever you need to have a mini-wine tasting at home.  I have three bottles of wine recruited, a basket, hand-painted glasses, wine charms, a corkscrew (I think), napkins and plates (I think), chocolates, and bottled water.  I am going to go shopping with the donations for the rest of the stuff -- cheese and fruit gift certificate, platter and cheese knife (knives), a wine guide, and a tablecloth.  Should be fun... it's for the Dance Around the World silent auction fundraiser this weekend at the Newman Center.  Any excuse to get dressed up... though I think I may do the pantsuit route, as I'm not feeling very "glamour girl" this week, despite the beautiful sunny weather that SHOULD be making me feel great.  I'm ready to run off to Mexico now...

      Ahhhh.... yes.  I'm sure you all noticed my very absent self this weekend.  Grading papers... again.  I've made a dent since I last posted -- exams are done, lab reports are done, and two of the three re-grades are done.  I have recitation essays to grade tonight, which didn't get done this weekend.  Why didn't I get anything done you ask, being as I don't have reason to celebrate Valentine's Day?  I was celebrating it for me this year.  No one else.  I took care of myself on Saturday -- did yoga, alloted some "sister hang-out" time, rode around in the rental she got while her car is in the shop (it's a Dodge 4x4 quad cab short bed, 2003 model -- SWEET!!!), picked up my Valentine's Day present to myself.  What did I get for myself you ask?  A diamond.  Yes... I bought myself a diamond.  See, my crucifix (which mom and dad bought for my 1st Communion) had a small diamond in it, and well, it fell out shortly before Christmas.  So I waited till I had a bit of extra cash and time and took it to the jeweler to get repaired, and I didn't have the extra time to pick it up til Saturday.  And besides, if I can't have someone else to buy me diamonds, at least I can get diamonds for myself!  Still fighting the "sleepy monster," despite a three hour nap Friday night (from which I was woken up by a nice catch-up call from Sean) and having a lie-in on Saturday, Sunday, and today.  Part of the still tiredness is staying up with FC and K for FC's birthday celebration.  Fun stuff.  Would have been more fun if I had actually imbibed some of the jello-shots I made for FC as his birthday present.  The best part was making enough for (what I thought, according to information he gave me,) was his age, putting candles in all of them, and arranging them in the shapes of the numbers for his (actual) age.  It took him about 12 tries to get them all blown out, and a few of us waving and flailing crazily to prevent the smoke detector from going off.  Then proceeded to hang out, then tried to figure out how to light sparklers on a windy 30 degree night, lighted said sparklers successfully and ran around outside with the sparklers lit till I couldn't feel my hands -- that didn't take long.  Now we've started picking out potential jello shots for the St. Patrick's Day party FC and K are going to host at their house in the coming weeks.  One idea was a jello-shot table, just tupperware tubs full of ice, and LOTS of jello-shots, set up in the garage.  K and I were plotting how to decorate the garage with sheets and Christmas lights -- turning it into a Jello Shot Room.  Hahah!!!  In any event, it was a fun and semi-productive weekend.  And now, back to the weekly grind!!!  :-)

      I love  urlLink Wesley Clark !    You don't understand...he is all I've ever wanted in a President.  Well, aside from the pro-choice thing, but that's a very long story for another post on another day.  Now we just need to get him the Democratic nomination so that he can kick Bush's skinny little Republican butt out of the leather-lined-Oval-Office-chair he doesn't deserve!  Grrr.  :-{  Don't blame me... at least I chose the lesser of the two poor choices in the last Presidential election.  Sometimes, I wonder what kind of post-9/11 society we would have if Bush wasn't President.  Really.  I mean, if Gore HAD been elected, I think we would be living in a very different place today.  Makes you think.  Makes you realize the impact our leadership has on what actions our country takes in times of conflict and in peace, the public policy changes, etc.  I've never realized the impact of that til I started considering all the media coverage that basically points a finger at Bush and says "HE's the reason we're in Iraq/this mess."  I have to say though, I'm happy to see the "bite" of the media back.  For a while, I was truly worried.  Especially right after 9/11.  If you said anything against the President, the "war" -- basically anything that could be construed as the least bit "unpatriotic" -- people jumped all over you and accused you of being "Anti-American."  I'm not anti-American... I just wonder sometimes whether our "freedom of speech" really applies to everything.  What truly bothered me about that time, was the multitude of people who all of a sudden seemed to "get patriotism."  It reminded me of those "Got Milk?" ads... you know the ones... they ask you if you "got milk?" in a funny way.  All of sudden we as a country were inundated with this "cool fad" that we all had to have, so we ran out and bought some at our neighborhood Wal-mart to stream from our houses, backpacks, and SUV window.  I've had an American flag pin on my backpack since December 2000, and I still haven't taken it off, despite my misgivings about my country's government, my country's Commander in Chief, and the fact that I can't voice either of those openly without getting strange looks from people questioning my committment to my country of citizenship.  Patriotism is not something you can buy, or put on or take off at will.  It is something you may or may not be taught from a very young age, it is not as simple as a written word, and it is not just that FLAG you pledge allegiance to every morning in elementary school.  It is the very rights our forefathers fought and died for at the initation of our country.  That lesson is what I pledge to when I hold my hand on my heart and say the Pledge.  And the reason why I cry when I hear Taps or the National Anthem on Memorial Day/Veterans Day is because I remember my mother and my grandfathers teaching that lesson to me with the same sort of emotion and conviction -- no matter what our leaders do, and what our country does, that we ARE Americans and we darn well better act like it ALL the time by USING our rights we have so fortunately been given.    Being a patriot is not a part-time job.  It is a full-time job.  You say, "Don't tell me how to do my job."  Well, I am a patriot, just like you... so I think I'm entitled to tell you how to do your job because I have the same one.  Take adavantage of your rights to free speech, liberty, and the life-long pursuit of happiness, but respect the fact that we are all entitled to them in the form of opinions... and EDUCATION... and good healthcare, a positive environment, and the opportunity to succeed.  Teach others not to take these things for granted.  Stand up and say your piece too!  Make sure to VOTE.  Write your Congressman, Senator, local newspaper, Michael Moore... just make yourself heard.  TODAY!!!!!

      Saturday -- managed to learn to snowboard a little bit at  urlLink Seven Springs , PA.  I can now successfully traverse on my heel edge and do a J-stop, still working on that on my toe edge.  Haven't yet gotten off the bunny hill, still can't carve, and only have one foot locked into the bindings.  But I can do it a little with some level of control and not freaking out.  It was FUN!  I'm going to go again!!!  Today -- went to my first physical therapy appointment.  Surprisingly, I could snowboard with little to no problem (cause of the painkillers I think!), but my shoulder still hurts, and my neck still hurts.  I've also got some lovely tingling down my whole arm -- to the point where I have trouble using my hand occasionally.  Still hurts a little to lift it up and to the side too.  The PT said that I didn't dislocate my shoulder, but that it's an impingement injury (if you want more info on that, just ask!).  Basically, it's loose in the socket, and is snap-crackle-popping, which could be an injury to the little cuff inside the shoulder joint.  The reason my shoulder blade and neck hurt are because those muscles are trying to compensate by contracting and holding my joint together.  So I'm now into PT for the next month until it gets stronger and to evaluate if there is any major damage to the little cuff inside the joint (really no way to know at this point).  I hate being accident prone.  :-(

      I felt better yesterday (sun = Happy Nicole) until I fell on my butt on the death ice at the bus stop.  On my butt, and partly on my hand, so my whole right arm/hand/shoulder/neck hurts.  And my left shoulder also hurts from compensating.  I can't turn my head without pain.  Going to the doctor's office tomorrow morning to get it checked out and to get another refill on my migraine medication.  I've been getting far too many of those.  That and tension headaches, which it is also good for... so needless to say, I may go through my existing bottle pretty quickly, what with my current situation.  We started dissecting the fetal pigs in my lab today, and so I feel disgusting and gross.  I need a shower.  I didn't actually get any on me, but you leave just feeling like there is a film over you.  And I've cut so much pork today I feel like a butcher.  My new lab job of autoclaving glassware and pipette tips started last week.  Thankfully, our autoclaves are back online, so I'm running not one but two loads o' glassware -- one upstairs and one downstairs.  Yay!  Clean stuff!  (obviously, I'm the right one for the job...)

      AAAA.  It's back to tropical paradise in our lab.  The ceilings have stopped leaking (for now), our heat is back on high, and the autoclave is non-functional for a reason that doesn't have to do with the distilled water being off (it's because it WAS off that it's not working... gunk in the lines, and the tech can't come for a while yet...).  The sun is out (at least in pieces it was yesterday).  It's not insanely bitter cold, and the snow has stopped temporarily.  Life is starting to feel good again.  At least it was this morning.  My Zip drive got eaten by the computer upstairs (on the scanner).  I had my presentation for this morning DONE, except I needed two photos scanned in.  So I went up to do that, then make copies.  I put the disk in ... "clicky, clicky" goes the Zip drive, I pop my disk out (another computer did it a while ago and the disk was fine after).  Scanned my pics in, hadn't saved my presentation to hard drive/network yet (except for AT HOME which doesn't help me AT WORK), went back downstairs to finish... and my disk is no longer recognized, formatted... it's in the drive but the computer can't open it.  Stupid upstairs old computer screwed it up and ATE IT!  So I gave my lab meeting on transparancies... after staying up almost all night working on my Powerpoint slides.  At least the all nighter knocked the info into my head and I had a hard copy of my outline handy.  Sometimes, low tech is best.  Reason number 865 to ALWAYS save to the network drive WHEN YOU OPEN something from a ZIP disk.  So now I have to go shell out another $10 for a new Zip disk.  Got to go to class...seminar then evolutionary bio review.  [sigh]  I want a vacation.  My friend Michael (who's a seminarian -- studying to be a Catholic priest) gets vacation.  A week in SOUTH BEACH.  How unfair is that?  Not that he doesn't deserve a vacation -- his classes are HARD.  But I deserve a vacation too dangit!  If only I didn't have classes, I would totally go skiing in Colorado with my pals who are going in February.  At least I get a day trip (to  urlLink Seven Springs  this Saturday for snowboarding ... yay!  I get to fall on my butt all day!  :-D)

      Just a note so y'all don't think I'm dead...  LAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!  =)  Hahaha...  get it?  "note"... "LA"... "Sound of Music" sound familiar?  "Doe, a deer, a female deer..."?  Never mind...  Spring quarter started today.  No more empty parking lot... now I have to compete for a spot!  Starting a garden... started seeds this weekend, going to start more today.  Apparently, there are plots you can rent in my neighborhood, near campus... so I'm looking into that.  There is also an attractive 4x4 foot raised bed under the stairs by my apartment that I'm checking into.  But for now, my cherry tomato plants and green bean bushes are mere seeds in my  urlLink Jiffy-7 MiniGreenhouse  (basically balls of dirt in a plastic "house" so the moisture and heat are maintained).  It's an ingenious invention, really.  The little Jiffy things are dehydrated peat, wrapped and pressed in biodegradable casing -- add water, they expand, and you add seeds.  Then, when it's time to plant, you just put the whole thing in the ground and don't risk disturbing the root system.  Very cool.  Relatively cheap (because I went to Strader's Garden Center in Columbus, not the website I used above).  I think I've found a new hobby.  =)

        You are Emily Dickinson!  Not all that much is known about Emily Dickinson, probably because she holed herself up in her room and wrote poetry.  She didn't have very many connections with the world outside her house, and her poetry is very introspective and compartmentalized.  You need to get out more.    urlLink   Which famous poet are you? (pictures and many outcomes)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Apparently my personal space issues are not going away as fast as I thought...

        cuddle and a kiss on the forehead - you like to be close to your special someone and feel warm, comfortable, and needed    urlLink   What Sign of Affection Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    WOW.  I know about a dozen people who would very much disagree with that.  Actually probably everyone I know in Columbus would probably disagree with that.  See, the thing is... my friends here all think I have "personal space issues," because most of my friends in Columbus are not people with whom I am affectionate/touchy feeling/whatever you want to call it.  The suprising thing to them, however, is that I didn't used to have personal space issues.  My family is very affectionate, hugs and kisses fly all round at every family event.  Hugs every day, every night, every hour.  Randomly catching you from behind while you're cooking or from the side while you are watching TV.  Sleepy hugs in bed, when someone wakes you up on a lazy Saturday morning.  Careful hugs, trying not to spill coffee on the floor while half asleep.  Hello hugs.  Goodbye hugs.  Hugs for no reason.  Hugs "just because I love you."  (those are the best!)  Hugs as a weapon of choice when trying to tame crazy 8 year old cousins, hugs on top of mountains and on Dinosaur Rock hikes.  Kisses on tops of foreheads and on cheeks when saying goodnight around the campfire.  Raspberry kisses on stomachs to make my little cousins scream with laughter.  So I grew up very much a person used to being hugged, kissed, and crammed into too small houses and tents and restaurant booths.  College changed that.  Or rather, certain people in college changed that.  I started out willing to be affectionate with friends, after only knowing them a little while.  It worked for a while.  Then certain people that I chose to allow into my Personal Space Bubble didn't live up to the unspoken trust I placed in them, these perfect strangers I gave the right to act like family.  So the betrayal (or abandonment, or whatever it you want to call it) that happened after I trusted them to hug me became something I wanted to avoid.  I reasoned that if I didn't allow anyone to become physically close to me, that I could also keep my distance emotionally -- and avoid getting hurt.  Mind you, this didn't apply to everyone... I had occasions where I would go out on a limb, let someone in, and in the end, got hurt.  But I also had occasions, where for one reason or another, I chose to go out on a limb and didn't get hurt.  I have some of my best friends from those latter occasions.  Unfortunately, it didn't mean I went out on a limb more often -- it actually made it rarer, because I had friends, I had people I trusted.  I reasoned that I didn't need anyone else.  Then I moved.  A fresh start at trusting, you probably think...  Only past experience made me even more wary -- these were people who didn't know me AT ALL.  So I moved even farther back into my shell, making up reasons I didn't want to be touched, inventing new ways of looking uncomfortable when someone got into my personal space bubble.  All to the point of my friends beginning to believe that I was always like this... that I have always had "personal space issues."  Up until recently, that is.  Now I am realizing it truly is better to have at least tried to get to know people, rather than holing up in my room being lonely and miserable.  And, quite frankly, pushing people away all the time isn't any fun and wasn't making me any better friends with people I truly care about.  So the next time I see you... remind me to give you a hug!

      So after a long day filled with basketball, naps, and tissue culture on Saturday, I headed to FCs and Kristen's house for the big St. Patrick's Day bash.  It was fun.  We actually attempted a round of green beer flip cup, then thought better of it, since green food coloring generally isn't easy to get out of clothing or concrete floors.  So we played regular flip cup, ate jello shots, and well... overall, between Miss Jello Queen (me) and Bartender (one of Kristen's friends), it was a pretty darn good party.  At least while I was there.  Then I left, and went home to my nice warm bed with fuzzy flannel sheets and those weird dreams I always end up having when I drink til I'm tipsy.  Mind you, when I say "weird" I mean "strangely real/lucid to the point of me waking up and wondering where the heck I am" because it felt VERY real.  Those sorts of dreams freak me out the most.  For example, if you dream about holding someone's hand, and you can actually feel their fingers in your hand.  Sometimes I wonder if I'm astrally projecting myself or some other such incredibly fantastic explanation.  But then I think, hey, I do have an overactive imagination (I daydream a LOT...), so it makes sense that my brain, while attempting to make sense of the day's events, decides to take some artistic license and insert some overly lucid things into my REM cycle.  At least, that's what I have to tell myself when I wake up with a start in my dream, then wake up with a start REALLY and try to place myself back into my own skin.  So, for now at least, I'm feeling not-so-freaked out by the dreams I had last night, but I'm still trying to make sense of them in the rational part of my brain.  Good thing I have plenty of experience with this... and lots of resources at my fingertips.

      Yes... I have been sucked in.  I entered a pool at work for the NCAA Men's Tourney.  I went to two Women's Tourney Games this afternoon.  And hence, I am at work on a SATURDAY at 7 PM finishing up what I could have this morning, but for my March Madness.  Oiy.  The good news is, at least, that my picks are doing pretty good, aside from a few that were TOTAL upsets.  St. Patrick's Day party tonight at FCs house.  We made over 100 jello shots in preparation for this thing.  It's gonna be a fun party.  :-)  Even if I don't drink.. watching other people get tipsy on my jello creations is fun enough.  I love green jello.  :-)  Not much else going on at this end... why isn't anybody commenting on my shoutbox? -->>>>>>  Feel free to take a jab...

      Grrrr...  So I started out today with a plan.  To be confident I guess... it was so long ago that I don't even remember honestly what my plan was.  I went to work, then promptly remembered I hadn't done something I was supposed to do LAST night, and I've spent all day catching up with myself since that moment.  Of course, starting the day like that doesn't exactly bode well for confidence in oneself.  Nor keeping on a schedule.  Neither of those things has really happened today.  So my "die" action... since I'm sure you were all "dying" to know... HAHAH!!!!  LOL... {snort}... {snort}... {snort}... {snort}... {snort}... {snort}... oh, golly, that was a HOOT!  I'm freakin' hilarious!  Anyway... it turned out well.  :-)  And I'm STILL not going to tell you what it was, for two reasons.  One, I'm still not sure that it doesn't work a bit like birthday candle wishes -- if you tell, does it reverse?  Two, I'm revelling in a little personal happiness and sharing it sort of diminishes the small, whispered "yay" secretness of it.  :-)  But I am very happy today.  And I was Monday.  But more so today, because it's really hitting me now that it DID turn out well, and that yes, you can take risks and have them turn out okay.  The positive result, of course, helped that feeling, but even if it wasn't a positive result, I think I would still feel confident today.  In any event... ..."yay!" :-)  St. Patrick's Day is tomorrow.  I have two good things to look forward to tomorrow... GREEN BEER and knowing how to say "kiss my a**" in Gaelic.  :-)  Party responsibly people...

      Oiy.  Thursday.  This quite possibly is the longest Thursday EVER.  Not that it has been unpleasant... just LONG.  And I'm supposed to go out for a birthday tonight... where am I supposed to get the energy for these social things after a draining day of work?  Need to grade, but yet, my brain needs a break too.  {sigh}  Still working on my "DIE" action... It's funny though.  Now that I've made up my mind to take that particular risk, I feel more confident already, as if the decision itself is a risk.  I guess it is, now that I think about it, being as before I wouldn't even consider it.  :-)  ::: smiles ::::  Now I just have to follow through...

            You're  The Guns of August !   by Barbara Tuchman     Though you're interested in war, what you really want to know is what causes war. You're out to expose imperialism, militarism, and nationalism for what they really are. Nevertheless, you're always living in the past and have a hard time dealing with what's going on today. You're also far more focused on Europe than anywhere else in the world. A fitting motto for you might be &quot;Guns do kill, but so can diplomats.&quot;      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     AH!  Is it bad that I've never read this book?  Should I have?  Reading a lovely book called  Change Your Life in 30 Days ... not that I'm a quick fix kinda gal, but I am the sort of person who believes in the mantra "when all else fails, read the directions."  So... being as I've been questioning my current life direction (all aspects of it), I figured it was worth a read.  So far... good advice, commensense-type things -- which I always need someone ELSE to tell me, because I lack it altogether.  School -- one more week of class, then finals and then no more teaching!  I'm taking one seminar next quarter though, which my advisor is an instructor of, so we shall see how that goes.  Life -- It's "Stretch, Risk, or Die Week"!!!!  I'm going to Stretch and Risk this week... and I have a "Die" action lined up.  A "Die" action would qualify as one of those things that makes you feel as if you're going to die if you take that particular risk.  That isn't to say that it WILL end badly... it's just that you are so afraid of the negative result that it makes you feel like you might die by just taking that risk.  I'm not telling what my "Die" action is though... that is a "die" I'm not ready for this week!  Keep your fingers crossed and pray for me!

      AH!!!  It's Tuesday!  What happened?  -- I pulled a muscle in my back yesterday (Monday).  Owie.  :-(  I've been hobbling about like Quasimodo since Monday afternoon.  Don't know what I did.  I am on painkillers and a Thermacare back patch (great stuff, those things...) all day today so that I can continue to function.  -- Papers... still ungraded.  Thank goodness for coffee, as it will be my close companion these next few nights.  -- Friday:  Andrea came into town for her CDC interview (Collegiate Development Consultant -- it's a travelling position with Delta Gamma, where she'll get to travel all over the country and visit different chapters...).  So we went out to dinner at Spagio, then to Brothers for a bit downtown.  After about an hour, we were both done with the bar thing for that day -- so sad, since we used to close down Bob's in Akron on a regular basis.  In any event, as we were leaving my apartment for Brothers, Tank had called and asked if we knew anyone with a hot tub or pool.  Which I don't.  But I suggested buying a kiddie pool and a home spa thing and making your own.  I was half joking.  But he called as we were leaving the bar... he and his housemate Kristen went and BOUGHT A KIDDIE POOL!  The kiddie pool was not a kiddie pool, but in actuality about the size of a room in my apartment, and held over 50 gallons of water.  So trying to fill it with hot water didn't exactly work, as his hot water heater only holds about 50 gallons.  So the water was ICE COLD.  I stood in it for about 30 seconds, we took some pictures (since we had it set up in the basement), and hopped out to go get my clothes back on.  Adventures...  -- Saturday: Delta Gamma Founders Day (celebrating the 131st anniversary of the founding of our national organization, and our three founders' ideals).  Went, saw tons of collegians, lots of alumnae that I knew, won a prize in the raffle, ate a good lunch.  Very fun, as usual.  And next week, I'm going to Akron's Founders Day, as it's Eta Chapter's 125th anniversary.  YAY!  -- Saturday:   urlLink Buca  Night!  Yehah!!!  We got to sit in the Pope Room (surprisingly), which has a bust of Pope John Paul II on the table on a giant lazy susan so you can pass food around more easily.  It's a big table for about 20, and the room is circular with all sorts of papal art and knick-knacks on the walls.  There's even a "pope" chair outside, so we took pictures in that, and of each other impersonating the pope.  Which was doubly funny, since the entire group was Catholic!  Good food, good wine, good friends.  What more can you ask for?  -- Sunday: Slept in, then watched TV and went to Church.  Very uneventful.  -- Monday:  (see above)  Class, seminar, lab.  PAIN.  :-p  I hate getting older.  Hope that is enough to tide y'all over for a week or so until I get these papers done.  :-(  Think of me fondly as you are all having fun...

      Quick note because I need a pick me up.  I feel like crap.  All around.  TOTALLY like crap.  I'm cold, I'm sore, I am EXHAUSTED.  I want to crawl under my bench, curl up into a warm little ball wrapped in my snuggly fleece pullover, and just die.  Better yet, I'd like to go home and snuggle into my pile of pillows under my fleece blankie and quilt and teddybear (yes... I have a teddy.  And he's a good snuggler, which is what I really need right now or any time I feel like crap...) and sleep for a long, long time.  Well, maybe at least an hour.  Then I think I could face the world again.  Might have something to do with the fact that I only got 4 hours of sleep last night.  Might have something to do with the fact that I played softball for the first time in 15 years last night.  Might also have something to do with the fact that I haven't been sleeping or eating normally for the past few weeks.  Might also be just my body crashing after all the caffeine I've ingested lately.  In any event.... I feel like crap today.  I'm trying to compensate with more caffeine, a triple dose of ibuprofen, and the hope of a nap in a nice warm bed this afternoon before going for ice cream with a good friend.  The bad part is, I felt like this at 8:30 AM this morning.  If I hadn't had class today, I think I would have just stayed in bed and slept all day.  Wish I could do that.  I think I may do that Saturday morning... after my 8:30 AM pedicure.  That was a stupid idea... scheduling a pedicure (to be nice to myself) for 8:30 AM on a SATURDAY (that's just plain crazy).  But I do have a lot of stuff to do Saturday morning, so I suppose it's good motivation to get out of bed in a timely manner, get my stuff done, and then take a nice nap in the afternoon.  I like that plan.  Just thinking about sleep is making me feel tired.  Though it's also motivating me to get through my day so that I can go home and sleep.  Wish me luck...

      YAY!  I found a great site to map all the places I've been.  :-(  Apparently, I've not travelled as much as I thought.  I mean, I knew that.  But still... a lot of people I know haven't been half the places I have.  So I thought I was doing good compared to my peer group.  Using the globe as a standard, though, I'm not doing so hot.  In fact, I think I'm behind.  It would help if I actually had MONEY to travel.  And TIME.  Time would help too.  So taking that into consideration, I guess I'm going okay.  In any event... it's at the bottom of the page.  Missed out on Girls' Night last night due to work.  The life of a graduate student... gotta love it.  Tonight's "fun time activity": Softball and shrink art making with S and Steve.  More on that later...

      This week's BIG accomplishment -- getting all my homework for the week (i.e. four review articles read and notes made upon...) so that I can have quality time for other things.  =)  I'm very proud of myself for that.  Now I can have fun on nights this week I would normally be bashing myself for putting off my homework yet again.  Double yay!  =) =)  Mostly, the motivation came from Steve.  Yes, that's right -- laidback Steve (who has the ability to be in "low energy mode" so well that sometimes I think he's sleeping when we are talking) motivated me... lil' Miss High-strung.  Don't worry, the irony hasn't gotten past me.  The reasoning I had about getting my homework done was that then I would be free all week... Steve gave me the reasoning that "free" means "fun time"... that's the extra push I needed.  :-D  So last night after work, I decide that my first "fun time" activity was going to be craft time!  YAY!  I love craft time.  I never do crafts anymore...I used to all the time -- I'm a crafter.  I have boxes, upon boxes of craft supplies.  I do just about every craft there is.    Last night's projects involved a 50 lbs. bag of sand (as of yet, unopened and in my car trunk -- for later use), an exacto knife, homemade stencils, paper bags, tissue paper, construction paper, scissors, a rollerball pen, and a gluestick.  I had everything but the exacto knife already (though come to think of it, I HAD an exacto knife, I just didn't feel like digging around my apartment to find it.  And I bought more paper bags, because I didn't realize I already HAD some.  But whatever.)  Yeah, that's right... HOMEMADE STENCILS.  I'm a REAL crafter -- none of that store-bought, laser-cut mylar stuff for me (though I have one, and it is very nice... but not CUSTOM-made like these!) -- I make my own stencils.  In any event... tonight's fun time event is Girls' Night.  Hmm.  Not sure how I'm feeling about this.  I'm not really one to sit around and have "relationship gossip time."  Stereotypically, that is a "girls' night activity."  So I'm hoping girls' night tonight doesn't turn into that.  Or that I can turn it into something else.  Or at least that I am able to handle sitting through relationship gossip time to get to the good stuff of "the good events in life" discussion.  Or random discussion of career plans, or anything else.  It makes me very uncomfortable to sit through "relationship gossip time" because it makes me think of a group of people sitting around analyzing  my  relationships with others.  Not cool.  At least not cool if I am THERE.  I suppose if I don't know about it, then it bothers me less.  But it still bothers me when I think about it.  But if I don't know about it, then I don't know to think about it, so it wouldn't bother me.  But I... aw forget it.  I'm rambling and starting to make less and less sense about this.  Suffice it to say, I don't like gossip, about me or otherwise.  Running late on my work today... will be here later than anticipated.  :-(  But things are going well, and it will give me more time to look for fun time things for this SUMMER while I'm waiting for incubations... YAY!

      I had fully intended for this day to be a "toomuchcaffeinetoolittlesleeptoolittlefoodandonceIgethomeIcrash" kind of day.  I stayed up far too late last night, and despite red-wine-induced, high-quality sleep (there is nothing that helps me sleep better than a glass of wine... absolutely nothing), I was still "yawny" this morning.  I still am.  I came in, dragged one of my co-workers to the coffeeshop across the street -- I LOVE CUP-O-JOE!!! -- to get my dose of dark roast for the day, sure and certain to get and keep my heart racing all day.  I even got a scone.  And my coffe is now cold, and has been sitting all day.  I drank only a little, then tried to get to work.  Not drinking all of it was a BAD idea.  I'm going to have to reinitiate my "make coffee at home and drink it on the way to work so I'm caffeinated when I get there" plan.  It was working for a while, then promptly backfired when that would be the only caffeine I had -- I'd crash, and be more tired the next day.  This caffeine habit is getting expensive.  More than cigarettes -- good thing I don't smoke, or else I'd have to pay for that too.  I've been keeping track of my cash (read = "coffee and snack") expenses this week, in an effort to figure out where exactly my money is disappearing.  I get cash, and spend it, and keep receipts, but I never look at receipts or track how much I'm spending a week in cash.  I only do that with my debit card because my bank does it for me.  How sad is that?  I'm the most over-organized person in the world, and my finances are a shambles.  Thank goodness Quicken makes it easy to fix them quickly.  THAT is what my big project is this weekend.  So yah... two bad habits I'm trying to adjust/kick this week -- caffeine and not paying attention to my spending.  I think that's pretty ambitious myself.  But I've been an ambitious person lately, with regard to my... hmmm, how shall I put this... "personal development."  Much to the pleasure of myself and others, it's been working well.  I'm getting a lot done today, and in the past week have been at breakneck speed getting things done, big projects wrapped up.  Now the issue is keeping a good pace without getting burned out.  I'm learning that a large part of this is allowing myself to take a break every once in a while.  To celebrate the small victories just as much as the large ones.  And to take time to do nice things for myself... You can't accomplish things in the eyes of others or yourself ..."...unless you take care of yourself"... as Steve said the other day.  I think I'm going to go get a pedicure this week, for something new and different in the "self-love" activity category.  Haircuts are my usual form of "self-love."  Haircuts make me happy.  I love having someone do or play with my hair, getting my hair washed/head massaged is such a treat too.  =D  Beverly (my stylist at Regis at Polaris Fashion Place) does an AWESOME JOB.  She's so nice, and so fun, so we always have great chats while she's working on taming my curls... so getting my haircut is doubly fun since seeing and talking to her makes me happy as well.  =D  I'm getting my haircut Thursday.  YAY!  In any event, it's back to work now... my coffee awaits, as does a paper or two for my class.  Staying up on my reading is work... but it's worth it.

      Ewww.  So it's 8:12 AM as I'm writing this... about 48 minutes til my presentation starts.  I'm sitting downstairs in the Bio/Pharm library (next door to the building where my class is) trying to ignore the butterflies flapping about my stomach.  I haven't eaten breakfast.  I never eat breakfast before a big presentation.  I'm always afraid if I eat, then I'll be sick DURING the presentation.  Having to run out of the room to throw up isn't exactly the stuff of grade A speaking skills.  (I mean, really, haven't you ever seen "The Princess Diaries"???... that's one of my favorite scenes, because I totally empathize.)  I keep thinking about what the priest who gave my First Communion told us at our "rehearsal" before the big day... (and I'm paraphrasing here...) I think it's good advice for any "big day":   "Don't eat a big breakfast.  Just some dry toast... maybe, if you have to eat.  Avoid orange juice, because if you DO throw up, it's very messy."   How funny is that... some of best advice I ever got from a priest was about skipping breakfast!?  Not that it's the TOP of the "Best Advice Ever Received from a Deacon or Priest" list.  Though, honestly, I can't think for the life of me what else is on that list.  Lots of stuff that I've internalized, but can't explain or articulate.  I suppose that's good, right?  At least it is in my reasoning... as long as I've internalized it, live it everyday.  I think that is the BEST way to give counsel to others, to be an example for others -- is to actually SET an example.  Right now, all I'm worried about is remembering to say everything I've been trying to remember to say for the past few weeks as I've prepared this thing.  If I forget some stuff, it'll be okay, since I have a feeling people will ask about it.  I'm worried about my talk running long... though I timed it last night and it ran about 50 minutes.  I'm shooting for 40 minutes -- last night when I timed it, I was stopping and starting, trying to talk slowly.  So with NOT starting and stopping to adjust thing and the "speed racer" speed I take on when speaking, I should be okay.  8:23 AM.  Still nervous.  Not as nervous, but still nervous.  Stomach -- okay.  Legs -- jiggly (not good...).  My knees could lock if I stand still, but I will be dancing all around if I don't stand in one place.  I hate it when I start shifting my weight to avoid dancing and knees locking.  I've only had my knees lock ONCE... and I didn't pass out, which is good, but I thought I might have if I hadn't gotten off the stage at just the right time.    Somehow, I always manage to pull it together despite all my nerves.  I've always gotten horrible stage fright before every public performance, small or large, acting, singing, dancing, speaking.  Doesn't matter -- I get the whole coldsweat, handsweaty, stomachflippy, headdizzy, anxiousnervousephysicallyill stage fright.  You would think I would not, as much as I've been on stage.  But it puts me in the "zone" I think... if I don't get horrendously, horribly, physically nervous... I flop.  Guaranteed.  I have to have the nerves... I'm an adrenaline junkie -- once I get worked up, then I have a moment of perfect calm before I start.  Where I take a deep breath, [inhale]... [exhale]... and release the nerves and tell myself "You're prepared, you're ready... now let's GO!"  This time will be no different.  Here I go...  4:54 PM Update to post... I got an A!!!! YE-HAH!!!!  :-D

      So my big lightning bolt realization this weekend is that, apparently, I am not normally one who behaves in a manner considered "girly."  This I guess I knew.  But I didn't realize how "girly" I can really be til Sunday night.  ::: blech ::: I think, if I had been watching me act this way, I would have made  myself  sick.  The interesting thing about, is that I really don't care.  :-D  I was having a [sigh] wonderful time.  :-D  Haha!  So there RULES!  Yay!  :-)  I'm starting to realize that a great many of you have absolutely NO idea what I've been talking about the past few weeks.  Which, quite frankly is good, because that means I'm doing a good job keeping my recent personal experiences just that -- personal and PRIVATE.  Minimal drama.  And you know what else I'm realizing?  That you don't have to have the drama surrounding things in your life to enjoy them (this I knew already, but wanted to reiterate that for those of you "dramatic" people who think EVERYONE has to be in on every detail.)  In any event, I had a good weekend walking around Columbus, hacking around golf courses back home, and catching up on sleep.  It's a fabulous life... and it will be more fabulous when my presentation is over tomorrow!

      [sigh]  Rules, rules, rules...  So I'm starting to realize that my recent decision to live life on my own terms is going to come with a hefty price tag -- the constant judgement of others.  Despite all my best efforts, it's becoming difficult not to worry about the opinion of others with regard to my actions and behavior.  The more I start to think, "hey, this is my life and I'm comfortable with this..." the more I start to worry more and more about how others are going to react.  Which, in reality, is my "control freak" self showing through -- wanting to know EXACTLY what the result will be before I take a risk, what people will say about me, how people will react to my face.  And I know that it is not realistic to think I can predict how people will react, how things will turn out.  I've been SOOOO happy lately.  I have made some decisions and moves in my life (on my own terms) that have brought me a LOT of joy, a lot of positive things lately.  I suppose the root of all this worry over what other people think is a form of self-sabotage -- "I can't be happy if it isn't 'right' or 'good' or up to others expectations and rules..." and of course, living so you make other people happy isn't going to make you happy in the process.  It just doesn't work that way.  And then I think, "am I happy?" -- I start questioning my own instincts, my own feelings.  Trying to check their validity against someone else's standard.  A very small part of me that I just want to squish flat is waiting for all this happiness to just disappear.  I keep hearing this little voice in my head -- "it's not real.  It's not real.  Just walk away now before you get fooled into believing it all again."  That same little voice always makes me think of a tiny little Nicole, tugging on my pantleg and pulling me back.  Digging in her heels to put the brakes on me moving forward with my life.  Screaming... "NO!!! Don't go that way!  Don't do that!  Don't risk!  Don't live!  Just don't take the leap and you can avoid falling all together!"  Part of the little voice is that my life has happened like that...just risking an inch, then more, then BAM.  Squashed flat like a bug... left with nothing to show for it except the "I told you so"s of the tiny voice of insecurity and fear that sucks the fun out of the joyful moments.  Well... this is MY life.  I know I'm living up to my own expectations.  And I'm happy.  =)  Nothing else matters to me but that.  For once in my life, I'm going to be selfish!

      My poster is done.  :-D  I made a poster for the Research Day in our college, and am entering it Wednesday afternoon.  Or rather I'm hanging it Wednesday afternoon, and it (and I) will be judged Thursday morning.  I'm nervous.  :-|  But strangely, I'm not particularly worried, since I don't think I have a shot at ALL of winning.  I'm doing it for the experience.  It would be nice to win, but I think I would feel like a cheater, since I didn't work very hard on my poster data.  My poster -- yes, I worked on that -- I'm obsessive compulsive with graphic presentation.  But the actual data... it's hard for me not to discount it, being the science pessimist I am.  Which isn't the right attitude to have, I suppose, but hey... when stuff hasn't been working for ya, it's hard not to discount your own work.  But I'm gonna enter it, get the experience, and hopefully have fun in the process  Can someone pass the sunshine?  I'm sick of this rain.  I think I'll move to Cancun.  Anyone care to join me?

      HAPPY EASTER!  Brief update:  -- Good Friday service was AWESOME.  :-)  -- went to a new restaurant (Blue Nile) Friday with Steve.  [Or at least it was new to me -- he has, I think, eaten at about EVERY restaurant in Columbus (which is saying a lot).  Of course, he's lived here pretty much his whole life, unlike me, who just moved here two years ago.  So he's had a bit of a headstart.]  Ethiopian food, comes out on flatbread, and you break off pieces of bread and use it to eat with your hands.  We also got to sit at what I'm guessing was a traditional table -- sort of low with low chairs, so you are sort of hunched over the food eating.  Being as you are eating with your hands, it makes it easier.  Very fun.  --  Saturday: Mom and Dad showed up.  I was up at 7:30 so I could be at work early and get some stuff done prior to that, which didn't work anyway.  Needless to say, I was a little peeved that I got up that early so I could finish the data to put on my poster and it's not even going on the poster.  Grrr... :-|  Anyway... went to the driving range with the folks, then to Buca for dinner (more on that later -- eating out with my mom is a TRIP, and that deserves a post of its own.)  --  Sunday: Easter Mass at Newman, then brunch at the Buckeye Hall of Fame Cafe.  WOW.  I don't think I've ever seen so much variety at a buffet and actually had it all be GOOD.  They had warm cherry pie for dessert.  :::swoons joyfully:::  I love warm cherry pie.  No ice cream though, but the pie was so good it didn't need it!  --  Funny cartoon -- entitled "hey steve" -->  urlLink http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail72.html   Hehe.  =)  Courtesy my sister Christine, who's been saying "hey Steve" to me a lot lately.  Maybe because she saw this cartoon.  And I mean, I do happen to know a Steve.  And I always greet Steve with a simple "hey" when we chat on the phone.  She has heard me do this, and can now tell it's Steve that I'm talking to on the phone when all I say to start the conversation is "hey."  Don't ask how...she's my sister, we have a psychic connection, blah blah blah.  But it's not like I say "hey STEVE"... just "hey."  Here's to a CAH-RAZY week...

       HAPPY FRIDAY!   Well, actually it's "GOOD" Friday -- the second day of Triduum.    Holy Thursday Mass was fantastic.  =)  I always come close to tears during that service.  It's a powerful thing -- if you are not familiar with the service, the basic precept is the story of Jesus washing His disciples feet.  This Gospel story is meant to inspire a service about service to God and service to others, and so my parish (and many others) do this by doing ritual washing of feet.  First the priests and staff, and then they too go out to wash the feet of parishoners.  Not everyone participates, but it is a very powerful visual symbol of how we are to be Christ to others.  All the songs are about self-gift, service to others, and having the grace to allow others to do the same for you.  [sigh]  Everyone goes to Ash Wednesday Mass, and it's not even a "Holy Day of Obligation"... Holy Thursday IS.  So many people miss out on a lot of beautiful lessons and services because they only think about "having" to be at Mass and how it takes time away from life.  My faith IS my life -- I don't know how I could separate the two.  I chose this path.  I frequently walk with others... on occassion, I walk it with out earthly company.  It's not about the "fun" I'm missing out on by following a few simple commandments.  I live my faith, and I have received such beautiful gifts by the grace of God by doing so.  By allowing it to be wrapped up in everything (some things, less so that others, but that is changing too...), I have seen so many things I never would have before I started to come to this "fullness of faith."  I could never comprehend the paradox of that term... how can you be "full" of something that in it's most perfect form is infinitely huge?   I always think of a certain verse -- "but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away." (1 Corinthians 13:10)  Or in my old New American Standard version it reads -- "But when the perfect comes, the imperfect shall pass away."  I suppose it is more like you are a "fountain of faith" as you come to more fully understand and grasp it... you fill up yourself, and as your faith grows, it fills up other things as well and the imperfect thing is washed away.   Faith fills up your life, your acts, the rooms of your house, your love for others, and your vision.   I no longer try to plan my life decades in advance or in minute detail.  I don't know what God has in store for me.  I'm not going to hide from it like I used to -- the great possibility of the unknown stretching out before me like the horizon.  Full of surprises.  That used to terrify me.  Not now.  I'm still scared, on occasion, but then I remember the infinite possibility I cannot begin to comprehend.  That no matter how infinite, that God's plan is waiting for me to simply take a step forward.  Open my eyes so that I might see where to next step, to open my heart so that I might be guided.  My blinders are off now, my eyes are open, and my heart is ready, for whatever God's plan has to offer me.  =)  I know... heavy stuff.  But this is a heavy day in many respects.  The event -- the crucifixtion of Christ -- that makes this day Good Friday.  The idea that this horrible thing happened to one being for ALL of us.  The hugeness and the simplicity of death on a cross.  Thanks for walking with me for a little while...

      So my nervous stomach is still hanging on.  This morning I woke up and felt so nauseous I actually thought about staying home.  Or making myself throw up to just get rid of whatever it is in my stomach that's making me feel so ill all day long.  I can't eat because I'm nauseous, but if I don't eat, it's worse sometimes.  Maybe I have an ulcer.  Or maybe there really ARE butterflies in my stomach.  I feel like maybe there are bats, not butterflies.  (Good grief! I sound like the heroine of a Judy Blume novel!  Speaking of which, did you hear they are going to make one of her books into a movie... FINALLY!)  Yes... I have butterflies.  [sigh]  I've always been the kind of person who likes having butterflies in her stomach, but it's been so long since this has happened that I'm trying to make sense of WHY exactly I have them rather than sort of enjoying the physical reminder that I have a life and emotions and humanity.  Usually it's pretty obvious what's causing the butterflies, but this time it seems to be a combination of things.  I think.  Actually I know... because usually butterflies are ONE thing, versus all out "I feel sick all day long and have butterflies for 5 minutes a day" is usually anxiety from an overabundance of stress in my life.  The latter is more accurate I think, even though some of the things that are going on are NOT stressful, but happy and different.  Different... I don't handle change well, so I think that is the main contributing factor.  It's a new quarter, I'm taking on responsibilities at work, trying to discern taking up leadership of the 20Something Ministry at my church, trying to enjoy myself and the weather and my family and my friends and the holiday-coming-up-time.  So many things going on, my head is spinning and I just want to stop the world and get off.  Yet I can't seem to deal with this without over-caffeinating myself to the point of hyperactivity -- taking my coffee-drinking/diet-Coke-swigging habit to the extreme.  Good thing I'm not more of a drinker, or else I'd be turning into an alcoholic by following that strategy.  In any event... probably best that I'm fasting today ( urlLink Triduum  starts tonight, today is Holy Thursday... so I'm fasting as part of my Lenten observance for all three days of Triduum).  I need to get some mental clarity as well, and fasting seems to help with that.  Lent always helps with that, especially near the end -- going to confession, Triduum Mass and services -- I start to focus so much more on what is really important, what I really need to do, to process.  I can't imagine not having this time -- it's a very powerful thing spiritually to have this sort of renewal of self.  I think my butterflies are slowing down now.

      Garden update:  My beans are growing like they are magic!  So far three of four seedlings are sprouted and have leaves.  I haven't yet figured out how I'm going to fit all these plants inside in individual containers until the last frost... hopefully their growth will slow and it won't be a problem!  The tomato plants are coming along slowly but surely... two little leaves on each plant so far.  I've gotten green onion and radish seeds as well, which I haven't yet started, due to lack of space/inventive relocation of the existing seedlings from their little greenhouse.  Hopefully I can find something at Straders this week so all my plants are on the same schedule!  p.s.  Happy Monday!  ;-)

      Ah, Sunday.  If I don't go into lab on Saturday, and look what happens!  I end up in the lab on Sunday.  :-(  But my reasons for not getting to lab on Saturday as planned were at least fun. -- late night on Friday of margaritas with Steve, Sean, Shannon, Jim, football Steve, Beth, and Jim -- sleeping late on Saturday -- yoga class :-) -- driving range with Christine -- Cookout at Tiff and Matt's house (super fun...despite the baked beans I brought being spilled from Pat's plate all over Tiff's rug!) -- Gallery Hop (it just isn't a month without walking past The Full Monty!) -- Wendy's chilli with the gang at Steve's house!  And now I'm about 10 minutes away from getting back to relaxing.  Or at least back to the "outside world" which includes late night Mass, laundry, vacuuming, dinner at "WT"s house, and hopefully a jump on this week's reading for my class.  I think I may just put off the reading til Monday -- it's been far too long since I had a lazy Sunday night of lounging around and enjoying time to think.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood...I think I'll go outside and enjoy it neighbor!  :-)

      Quick note of the week... Number 2.  So, I woke up this morning with a nervous stomach.  It's been like that all day.  Not "indigestion" or something that I could actually explain, but this weird, "I don't feel so good" feeling.  That's been following me around all day.  Blech.  Went to Shadowbox Cabaret last night... I laughed my head off.  Seriously -- it rolled onto the floor.  No, not really, but I got a few good snorts in there for good measure.  It was an awesome show.  Maybe I could quit graduate school and go be a Shadowboxer.  I mean, it's like kamikaze sketch comedy (which I love), along the lines of Monty Python (which I also love).  I think I've found a calling.  And the best part is, that it's half price for students... yay!  So I'm going more often I do believe.  So, apparently, my opinion that my sister is a spastic dancer is a much-agreed upon fact... look what she found... urlLink CHRISTINE is a SPASTIC DANCER  on the WWW!!

      I realized today that I have been blogging for five months.  FIVE MONTHS.  I think that's the best committment I've made to a hobby in a LONG time.  Now if I can only get myself to do that for exercise.  Speaking of exercise, I realized yesterday that Steve and I are a very good influence on each other.  Not that we go to the gym or anything like that together.  BUT we always end up taking a walk when we hang out.  We had been using the excuse of "I'm bored, so let's get out of the house...".  Last night, however, we both realized it was because we are going to be doing some major hiking this summer... and that we've been "in training" but not conscious of it.  So I guess that's good... our brains have tricked us into getting out there and walking to prepare for future adventures.  And I suppose there are a lot worse things we could be doing when we hang out.  Vandalism.  Devil worship.  Drinking.  Oh wait... we do DO that last one.  Not all the time, mind you, but occasionally.  :-)  Currently, I'm stuck in the lab by myself.  Repeating my botched experiment from yesterday and doing some other "housekeeping" work.  But at the moment, it's quiet, I'm in the middle of an incubation period, and there is not an interesting book or yummy snack in sight to occupy me.  There's the timer... til next time!

      It's 7:30 PM.  I have 15 minutes til my gel is done transferring.  Everything always takes longer than I think it's going to, especially at the end of the day.  Especially at the end of the day where all the work I got done this morning was for naught, because I forgot one major, important step in my other project for today and thus have to START FREAKIN' OVER tomorrow morning.  Grrr.  I was so motivated, and then it bit me in the butt because I was in such a hurry I forgot that all-important step.  Grrr.  My hiking shoes have been good all day.  Now my feet are slightly sore, but for the most part are okay.  Considering this is the first day I've worn them, that's quite a feat.  Hahah... "feat... feet...".  Never mind.  :-|  In any event, they are proving to be a good purchase.  Now I'm going to wear them tomorrow and Friday to break them in further before my hiking on Monday.  Though right now, being on my feet all day, I cannot wait to get home and take off my shoes and put my feet up.  I'm at the point now where I might go soak them for a bit.  Ah... bless the person who discovered Epsom salts help achy feet!

      YAY!!!  It's Wednesday!  :-D  Okay, okay... I know I shouldn't be that excited about it being Wednesday.  Personally, I think I should.  Because today is Wednesday, wonderful things are happening:  -- I got an appointment for a haircut today (and just got back... my scalp feels much lighter!) -- I get to go to dinner with Steve at a new restaurant (new for me anyway...). -- Packing for my VA trip begins!  Steve and I are "staging" our packing at his house.  Which basically means, that I have pack twice: once at my house, then again at his house.  Which is fine, because he's driving.  And it means I'll have the opportunity to get whatever I forget to pack the first time BEFORE the day we leave. -- No class = more time to work in the lab/more stuff done between 9 and 5 makes Nicole a happy woman.  So now you see why I'm excited.  It's 4 PM, I have two hours to go before I'm really done (I think) and can go home to start packing.  Preparation for this trip has been a very nice distraction.  Heck, it's been an activity in and of itself.  Planning... reading books... scouring the internet... booking camping site... Staging... packing... repacking... buying new gear.  The gear... well that deserves a paragraph of its own...    THE GEAR    Hiking boots  -- presently being worn all week to break them in.  Cushy, supportive, stylish... sorta like me.  :-)  Seriously, though, they are the kind of shoes I can wear all day and not want to take off, the kind of shoes I can scramble up Dinosaur Rock in, and the kind of shoes that actually make me wanna get out there and be "Adventure Girl"!   Hiking/good sandals  -- they're leather and nice, they're rugged and "grippy"-soled, they're everything a girl who hangs out with Steve (aka Captain Spontaneous the Ever-Hiking/Walking Wonder) could need in a shoe.   Swimsuit  -- doesn't exactly make me Ester Williams beautiful (not that a mere swimsuit could do that for me, because let's face it, I'm not Barbie).  At least the thing keeps all my ... ahem... "assets" where they should be and out of the view of prying eyes... which considering that I'm going KAYAKING this weekend, is the only thing I was really going for with this purchase!  Needless to say I'm excited about this trip, what with all the preparation I've been doing.  And I don't feel at all weird about buying the stuff I did for the trip because I was going to buy it anyway.  Eventually.  Now I have a good reason to hike and swim more.  And I won't have stiff feet from hanging out with Steve.  :-)

      Grr.  I hate Mondays.  Not that my weekend was bad... it was downright WONDERFUL (more on the wonderfulness later...).  It just had to end sometime.  I mean, weekends can't go on forever.  And I suppose it would make them less desirable, less fun, if we had them ALL THE TIME.  Not that the weekend is my favorite day.  My favorite day is Wednesday.  :-D  It used to be just because it was an odd day, the middle of the week, closer to the weekend, a night of fun.  Recently it has become all of those things, with the added bonus of it lately becoming quality time with certain friends.  I like Wednesdays.  I can't wait for Wednesday this week.  But the bonus of this week, is that even though it's Monday, the day has been productive, I have smashingly fun plans for this evening, and am looking forward to the rest of the week.  Yay.  Maybe Mondays aren't so bad.

        Trip fun!!!    So I found out yesterday there is a meeting I can go to this summer.  Related to stuff I work on in the lab.  In a cool location --  urlLink Park City, UT .  Only an hour from  urlLink Salt Lake City, UT .  How cool is that?  And the best part about it, is that I HAVE the resources available to fund the trip.  Even cooler than just the opportunity is that I can actually take advantage of it!  YAY!!  :-D

      YAY!!!  It's Monday!  I just LOVE Mondays.  :-(  Weekend was great.  Renee came to visit, and she and I and Steve flew my kite at the park Saturday afternoon.  The kite didn't like to stay up much.  There were also these two little girls who helped us fly the kite.  They wanted to fly it after we were done -- I don't think they understood it was our kite and that they didn't even know us.  But we let them hold the string and bring the kite back when it would fall down.  They got so excited about that... very cute.  I got a little sun on my cheeks, despite sunscreen and my huge sunglasses and my big floppy hat.  I cover up in the sun.  I don't like getting sun on my face, because I  urlLink FRECKLE .  I get freckles on my nose, my cheeks, my forehead.  I don't really like my freckles.  They are cute, to a point, then it just looks like a little much.  Plus, I have a history of  urlLink skin cancer  in my family.  Even if I didn't, I'd like to keep my healthy skin and not look 60 when I'm 30 from sun damage speeding the aging process.  So I wear sunscreen year round on my face, in the summer on my whole body -- SPF 30 or more.  And I still get somewhat tan.  Well, tan for me anyway.  If I don't wear sunscreen, I burn, and then turn a slightly darker shade of pale, so not wearing it wouldn't make me any tanner any faster.  When I lived in Australia, I wore sunscreen all the time and still managed to get darker than I had ever been -- the sun there is brutal.  I found out the hard way that you have to be very vigilant about putting more sunscreen on, wearing a hat, covering up.  I have learned NOT to miss a single spot.  My friends kinda look at me funny because I am so careful about that.  Once you get burned on your chest while wearing a sundress or on the backs of your hands or behind your knees, you realize that when they say put sunscreen on EVERYWHERE, they mean EVERYWHERE.  Besides, I've always sort of like the smell of sunscreen... it reminds me of summer.

      GAAAAAH.  It's 6:15 PM, and I'm finally leaving work, which normally is wonderful, except I still have to stop on my way home and drop off work stuff to be processed.  Gaaaah.  I need a nap like no one's business.  It's funny, that in the summer, I seem to need more sleep -- even when I'm not incredibly busy.  You would think, that summer, in the natural order of things, being the time when one SHOULD want to be outside or even by the reasoning that there are more daylight hours and less dark hours, that I would want to sleep less.  But no.  I'm a non-conformist, even by my circadian rhythms.  In any event... off to nap.  Oh sweet joyous sleep during the day!

        The endless day turns into endless night...    Library run... getting journal article for work.  But stopping to post very quickly.  It's been a LONG week.  Yesterday felt like Friday, to the poing that when Renee called, I told her (she who is coming to visit Saturday)... "I'll talk to you tomorrow..." then quickly realized that despite all my wishin' and hopin', that it wasn't Friday.  Today is THURSDAY.  Gaaahh... I can't wait for the freakin' weekend.  Ice cream run tomorrow is the only thing keeping me going at this point.  And good and happy things going on in life -- hanging out with Steve, Renee coming to visit, GUSTER concert on Friday, volunteering on Saturday, and potential new place to live (and a very cool potential new place to live... nice house with two nice roommates, a backyard, and a DECK.  Almost everything I wanted on my "list o' things a new place MUST HAVE/would really like to have" ... but it lacks a hot tub.  Somehow, I think I'll live without that...).  In any event... HAPPY THURSDAY!

      So everyone knows, I've not been in a perpetual state of feeling like crap.  It's been alternating between feeling fine and feeling like crap.  This morning, I was feeling fine -- groggy but fine.  Now I am getting a migraine.  Not sure why -- I think it's caffeine withdrawl, but I've had my daily cup.  Maybe I need more.  Maybe I need sleep.  Probably the sleep, moreso than the caffeine.  In any event, I'm going to take my handy-dandy migraine painkiller pill and hope it's gone before my next class.  OW -- my eyes hurt.  Stupid flourescent light at work.  *:-|  (  Oh... and the shrink art never got made.  :-(  But eventually I'll get to it.  I think.  I dunno.  Right now I just wanna nap.  BADLY.  But back to work, so that I can get something productive done today...

      So for goofing off this morning and not acting my usual motivated self, I am going to be at work for another 3 and a half hours.  From now.  So I may be here til 6:30 PM.  It's my own fault for not getting an earlier start today.  But the struggle to fight the temptation of the snooze button is evn harder when recovering from jet lag.  [sigh]  I suppose it's not really that much later than I might have been here if I had started super early.  Then I just would have been exhausted all day instead of just at the beginning of the day.  But right now, I think I'm going to be exhausted at the end of the day too.  But I'm getting a weekend away for the 4th without having to drive, and with plenty of time to just chill.  Yay...

      Okay...  I went to Utah.  I presented my research on splicing inhibition and mRNA-protein interactions to positive comments and discussion.  I learned a lot.  My brain is working on over drive to process it all...  My extra days were fantastic.  Great chance to be alone with my thoughts and just listen to the world and to my heart and to God.  I hiked  urlLink Timpanogos .  I floated in the  urlLink Great Salt Lake  at Antelope Island.  I went to Mass at the  urlLink Cathedral of the Madeleine .  I saw  urlLink Temple Square , and the  urlLink Capitol .  I slept in the  urlLink Peery Hotel .  I got to drive a cool  urlLink Kia Rio  around for two days.  I rode the light rail ( urlLink TRAX ), I fed the lorries at the  urlLink Tracy Aviary , and managed to get my car returned and checked in at the ticket counter right on time (1 hour and 30 minutes before my flight)... only to be told my flight was delayed a hour.  :-(  But despite not getting home til 1:15 AM this morning, I had an awesome time and am not too tired.  It was an awesome trip.  I'll hopefully get some cool pics and maybe let you see them, if you're lucky!

      My poster is done (just needs to be submitted for final approval by my advisor).  I'm submitting it to the printer tomorrow morning.  I have to book a shuttle from the airport, and confirm my flight and hotel reservations.  My suitcase is partially packed, my laundry is done (so that I can finish packing).  And I don't leave til Thursday!  So I'm in good shape I think.  Still very nervous.  So nervous that I felt yesterday like my poor heart was going to give up on me.  I had been lightheaded on Sunday, but figured it was just not eating (my notoriously low blood pressure will dip lower if I don't eat or drink enough water).  Then Monday, all day, I felt shaky, funny.  My left arm was feeling odd as well, and I could feel my heart doing strange things.  Today, I feel pretty much fine.  Still freaked out, but okay.  I get freaked out whenever my body starts to feel funny.  Most times, I can't explain it or reason why it's doing what it's doing, which freaks me out more.  This whole making time thing is not happening -- for anything lately.  My friends, prayer, sleep, cleaning, working out,... the list goes on and on.  I'm just a procrastinator, that's what it comes down to.  I leave everything to the last possible minute to make time for it, and the *POOF* I'm out of time and what ever it is doesn't get done.  Very bad habit.  Need to break it.  Any advice?  [sigh]  I wish it was Thursday!

      Can I just say how much I love Harry Potter?  I went with Shannon to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban last night, and was pleased.  Slightly disappointed at some of the things they left out, but all in all, a very good film.  I was able to escape from reality for a short while, something I've unfortunately not been able to do lately.  [sigh]  Work is kicking my butt.  I've been pretty productive this week I think.  I'm going to a conference in Utah next week, and trying to get all my data together into poster form in time.  Also trying to produce more data in time.  I'm VERY tired -- every day this week has been a long one, today being no exception.  And I'm coming in tomorrow as well for about 5 hours to get ahead a little and wrap up my work from today.  And finishing my poster.  [sigh]  I'm overwhelmed.  Plain and simple.  I've got about 5 things going on at once and trying to get all of them done in a timely and quality fashion.  I have been good about being realistic this week, in terms of what I'm capable of getting done with the time that I've got and the skills that I've got and not going crazy.  The last thing I want to do is crash during or right before this conference, since it is for work and I'm representing myself, my lab, my school, and my boss while I'm there.  So a half-awake, nonparticipating Nicole who has worked so much she's out of her mind is not my goal.  A well-rested Nicole who has accomplished a lot in the past week is what I've got right now and hope to keep going on!  I'm planning to set aside a little prayer time, a little outdoor time, and a little veg time tonight to reenergize myself before tomorrow and next week.  Wish me luck and leave me alone so I can succeed at this!

      Okay.  So I'm going to be honest.  My birthday was June 10.  I turned 24.  For real.  I don't lie about my age... especially when I already have the innate ability to pass for whatever age I want to... someone thought I TURNED 23 this year.  Honestly, a year isn't far off, but still.  I can't wait until I'm 83 and people guess my age.  My goal in life is to be a spitfire at 83.  Not in a bad way.  But in a healthy way -- still active, still have attitude to get what I want.  Birthdays are funny like that.  Everyother time of the year, I don't think about growing up.  But this week, that's all I've thought about.  Moving on in school.  In life.  Watching my friends grow up too... getting real jobs.  Moving into their own houses.  Getting engaged and planning weddings... watching them walk down the aisle.  Kids... being born or adopted.  Seeing people I used to drink and play cards with turn into "parents" before my eyes.  Having it hit home that at some point, it could be me with a ring on my finger, a briefcase in my hand, and a baby on my hip.  How scary is that?  Pretty darn scary if you ask me.  I mean, it's not an eventuality that when I grow up that I'll grow up THAT WAY.  Someone mentioned to me that just because you're married and have kids doesn't mean you're grown up.  It doesn't... it just gives the rest of the world that impression.  I haven't even come CLOSE to any of those things happening but still feel different than when I was 19.  I guess what I'm saying is that I've been realizing that I AM growing up.  And I like it.  Big things are happening in my life, propelling me out of childhood/highschool/college and into the real world.  The BIG ADULT world of paying bills, moving into a real house with my friends, accomplishing real things at work.  Thinking about the future -- buying life insurance, shopping for a new car, brushing up your CV.  Dating not just to be dating but because you care about someone and not worrying about time limits like the end of the semester.  Is there an instruction manual for all of this?  I sometimes wish there was, but then I think that I would rather stumble through it myself and do it MY way and no one elses.  Hopefully I won't get too many scraped knees in the process of falling down and picking myself up repeatedly.

        WORSHIP! You're inner Bombshell is the beautiful Audrey Hepburn. Like her you've been blessed with a "certain something" that no one could describe accurately. You are more reserved than other bombshells, and that shows in your gentle, graceful nature. You like doing things for other people and love volunteering for your favorite charity. Yours is a rare gift in this day and age. You don't need to show a lot of skin to be sexy, all you need is your eyes. To see Audrey at the top of her game watch the movie "Breakfast at Tiffanys".    urlLink   Who is your inner bombshell?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Interesting... considering when I put my hair was red, I got Lucille Ball.  My hair WAS red for a while.  Now it's just different colors of highlighted.  Also interesting given that Audrey is my favorite actress.  Thank goodness it's Wednesday.  I didn't think I'd be able to make it this far this week -- I'm very tired and the universe seems convinced that I don't have enough to do despite that fact.  Hmmph.  I did make good on my "to-do" list from yesterday though, aside from cleaning up.  I think this exercising everyday plan of mine has a high probability of success.  That's based on several things:  1)  My tae-bo tape is only 30 minutes. 2)  My alternate tae-bo tape is 8 minutes -- so I can never use the excuse that I don't have time. 3)  It's getting nicer and nicer outside -- all the more reason to go to the park and run or walk. 4)  Steve is out of town for the next three weeks.  This plays a part, because it means that I will have the copious amounts of time I've been spending with him EMPTY.  And I can't stand not having something to do, at least most of the time.  Plus three weeks to get into a routine reduces the possibility of me falling out of the routine. 5)  Work is high stress for me at the moment.  Exercise = stress reduction. 6)  I have not been sleeping well lately.  Exercise = more quality sleep. 7)  Been craving all sorts of sweets lately.  Exercise = can treat/cheat myself on the food side a little... 8)  Lately have actually looked in the mirror at myself.  The first words that come to mind are "eww."  "Omigosh."  and "hmmm... I don't think I'm as 'in shape' as I'd like to be."  That alone is enough motivation to get started.  In any event, I've got a lot of positive things going for me on that end.  Wish me luck.  :-|  A side note... on Steve going out of town.  I think it was harder to say goodbye to him knowing he's only going to be gone three weeks.  I mean, I see my one grandmother once a year (she lives out of state), and it's usually not as hard to say goodbye to her as it was to say goodbye to Steve.  I think it's the fact that I have been spending so much time with him that makes it hard -- I've gotten very used to that.  Whereas with my grandmother, I've gotten used to spending only a few days out of the year with her.  I'm going to have a lot of free time on my hands.  A great opportunity to reclaim the independent and solitary lifestyle that I miss more than I probably should admit because it just 'zap' disappeared very suddenly.  I'm hoping that having a chance to 'zap' have it back will give me more perspective on how to strike a balance between my independent, solitary time and time spent with Steve and friends.

      Uberquick update, as I'm in the middle of an experiment I can't afford to neglect...  Take home = DONE! Lab meeting presentation = 50% DONE! Shopping for the week = DONE!  Still to do today in order to maintain sanity: 1)  Work out... I've decided this is the month, this is the week, today is the day I make a committment to get in shape!  Tae Bo tapes, here I come!  2)  Take a nap ... again... this is the day I start taking care of myself.  If I don't do that, then I'm no good to anybody.  3)  Clean up apartment... part of my exercise in discipline and physical activity.  Wish me luck!

      It seems, lately at least, that everyone I know (and for that matter, a whole lot of people I don't know) are pairing off.&nbsp; Starting this weekend, I have four weddings to go to in the next four months.&nbsp; Two of which I am technically not an invitee.&nbsp; Steve got invited, and so as the girlfriend, I get to fill in the official role of "and guest" on the envelope.   Now don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I like weddings.&nbsp; I have nothing against marriage.&nbsp; Or married couples.&nbsp; It just irritates me a little to see this unspoken pressure to pair off.&nbsp; The idea that you are not complete if you don't have a partner.&nbsp; I thought like this before I had a boyfriend, and still do.&nbsp; Frankly, I refuse to settle for anything less that what I deserve in the dating/marriage department, bearing in mind that dating is to get to know someone on a better level and discern whether or not they are someone you could marry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at the very least to figure out what it is you want in a marriage partner, what you will put up with in the way of flaws.&nbsp; It's not dating for the sake of dating to have a partner in the short-term.&nbsp; And beyond that... the idea of getting married to someone, anyone just to be married.  The other part of it that irritates me is the insane idea of overpricing everything for weddings.&nbsp; I mean, really, would YOU pay $80 for a piece of tulle you are going to use ONCE?&nbsp; COME ON!!!&nbsp; But the reason they get away with it is because it's the "big day"... "you only do it once"...&nbsp; But it's not just the dress and veil... it's the attendants' dresses, the food, the alcohol, etc., etc., etc.&nbsp; It's just plain crazy.  I think the whole girly-ness of being a bride appeals to my feminine side.&nbsp; Then my rational side kicks in and says "HEY!&nbsp; You can do all of that for WAY less money...".&nbsp; I mean, when it comes down to it... I'd rather have a down payment on a house, or a new car, than to spend money on lots of kitsch I could have made myself.&nbsp; The memories are made by the people you invite to surround you as you and your significant other kick off the beginning of your life together.&nbsp; It's not about the food, or the dress, or the cake, or the flowers.&nbsp; It's about the CEREMONY.  That's the other thing that really irritates me... the tendency to forget about the sacrament being performed and replacing the focus on the party afterward.  Do you think if I had a potluck dinner if/when I get married that people would come and actually bring food instead of a gift?&nbsp; I think that would rock... then I know I'd have food I love made with love by the people I love, instead of a whole lotta stuff I already have and/or don't really need.&nbsp; Comments?  &nbsp;

      But I wasted a lot of it Monday.&nbsp; I thought I had once again lost my cell phone.&nbsp; So I spent several hours searching my car, the parking lot, my apartment, the public library, etc.&nbsp; To no avail.&nbsp; So I gave up and went to bed, hoping it would turn up.  Then I checked my voicemail Tuesday morning.&nbsp; I had a voice mail from my bank.&nbsp; There was some unusal activity on my debit card...  WHA!!!!  I called them back, talking to the security officer at my bank while frantically searching my purse and wallet for my debit and credit cards... checking to make sure anything else wasn't missing... hoping it was a bad dream.  But no.&nbsp; My debit card and credit card were gone.&nbsp; Like my phone.&nbsp; But everything else, including my ID and checkbook, was still there.&nbsp; Apparently, I figured out&nbsp;after all my detective work Monday and Tuesday morning, someone took the opportune few seconds while I was getting a library card at the public library to snatch my cell phone and cards from my open wallet and purse.&nbsp; RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME (well, my purse  was  sort of to the side and I wasn't paying attention...).&nbsp; AND A LIBRARIAN.&nbsp; AND ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE BEHIND ME IN LINE.  Okay, I know.&nbsp; I asked for it, right?&nbsp; But come on!&nbsp; In the public freakin' library!?!?!?&nbsp; In any event, after several hundred dollars damage, my bank and my credit card company assured me I would be reimbursed in a week for the full amounts charged, my cards would be replaced, and I've suspended service on my phone.&nbsp; But thank goodness for my bank... I would not have noticed anything amiss, since my ID was still there, for several days and more damage to my accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; Whew.&nbsp; *  The only problem is that I have to replace my phone.&nbsp; The question is, do I buy a refurbished phone cheap and pay out my contract... then go buy ANOTHER phone with a new company (I don't like my cell phone service...I get crappy signal.)?&nbsp; Or do I cancel my contract and go get the new phone?&nbsp; The damage ends up being about the same in the wallet department.&nbsp; So I'm evaluating this... any comments?  In any event... I'm praying for the grace to handle this situation.&nbsp; And for the person who did this.&nbsp; Obviously they are pretty desparate and needed help.&nbsp; Not that it makes the behavior right... but I can see why they did it.  My suggestion to all of you...   DO copy everything (front and back) in your wallet in case something happens... keep a copy in a safe place so you have the phone numbers you need from all your cards and IDs.  DON'T leave your wallet open laying ANYWHERE  DO&nbsp;keep an eye on your account balances and activity  DO find out what your bank will do if it detects odd activity... or if they even have a system to detect it...  As my high school principal used to say... "TRUST NO ONE."  &nbsp;

      Looking at my credit card (which I HAD planned to completely pay off this month, eliminating the "debt" of my most recent adventures in travel and fashion addiction), I realized that credit cards are evil.  That's right, evil, twisters of numbers.  I just knew I had enough to handle my Utah trip, my Hocking Hills trip, and to get some badly needed new lingerie (read: the items replaced were persistently jabbing me in a not so comfortable place near the ribs... putting me in danger of perforating a lung.).  But alas... my credit card balance and my checking account balance do not agree on this point.  So I'm paying off what I can (without preventing my rent from being payable) and leaving the rest for after payday.  I suppose actually adding up my budget expenses would have prevented this minor debacle.  S'alright.  Considering this is the first time in two years of graduate student budget-living I have been strapped for cash in the middle of the month... I think I'm doing pretty good.  And I still have my savings account cushion to dip into if need be, which is even better.  Next month, I'm replenishing the savings and then some.  Socking away the rest of my "travel grant" I received this past school year, so that I have money for upcoming meetings.  Saving a little bit at a time for the three weddings I have to go to this year, and the fourth I'm in next May.  [sigh]  Money is so important to be able to do things... not so much to HAVE... just to be able to give away to other people.  In other news... I'm moving at the beginning of August.  Not my website... my actual address.  Which relates to money, because it will be less expensive that my current arrangement.  Very good.  More money to save up and more money to spend on ... duhn duhn duhn... a new car.    Well, maybe not NEW.  New to me at least.  I need to have an at length discussion with my dad about this, since he's the car expert in  my family, but it has been suggested that now is a good time to buy/lease/replace what I have.  Even though Izzy, my faithful Cavalier, is still in very good condition, she is a Cavalier and not getting any younger or more valuable.  So I'm starting to reevaluate my budget, my thoughts about a new vehicle, etc.  The good thing about this is that my mom is my insurance agent, and can get me quotes on potential new vehicles, so I will have those numbers to crunch as well when making this decision.  It's a good thing some pleasures in life are  urlLink FREE ...

      Wackiness: 60/100 Rationality: 60/100 Constructiveness: 50/100 Leadership: 40/100   You are a WRDF--Wacky Rational Destructive Follower. This makes you a hacker. Your thirst for knowledge can be damaging to your possessions--you like to take things apart, even if you then forget to put them back together. You demand respect and, no matter how much you are respected, seldom feel it is adequate. You are tenacious, and will stick to a task long after weaker minds have given it up.   Socially, you are awkward, and get into arguments and make people uncomfortable. One recommends counting to ten, holding back comments unless warranted, and listening more than speaking. Still, your no-holds-barred approach to socialization can be strangely endearing, as long as you are funny and self-deprecating.  You feel misunderstood, and you probably are.

      AAAAHH!!!  I need more time!  Everyone just go away and let me get my apartment clean, my bills paid, etc.  It's Tuesday and I'm already pining for the weekend.  I feel like I've wasted most of my morning (cause I have) but feel like that's out of my control (though it's not).  God, give me strength to get through my work today!

      So the $115 worth of food worked well... we even had a few things left over!  Not too much... and mostly condiments.  So I have half a fridge full of condiments now.  :-)  Anyone who knows me knows this is not a problem.  I like my condiments.  It's a form of playing with my food.  Food should be fun, not just good for you and tasty.  Fun is a big factor.  For example, I was using my Plochman's mustard to write "delicious" on my brawtwurst this weekend.  That got big laughs... but it's also an effective way of getting my brawt just the right amount of mustard!  In other news, I made some interesting purchases on my lunch break today. --  urlLink rosary finger ring  (it has 10 "beads" and a crucifix on it... so I can use it to say the rosary, or just as a visual reminder of this path Our Lady walks with me...) -- a book on  urlLink St. Pier Giorgio  (a lover of nature and of God, Patron Saint of World Youth Day.  He led his friends and other young adults on hikes/retreats frequently in the mountains of Italy.) -- a  urlLink St. Teresa of Avila  Medal (patron saint of those who suffer headaches.  I've been meaning to get one for ages, but finally did today.  She was also "gifted with a pen and needle...", like me.)  Can you tell I've been contemplative lately?  Not in a bad way.  I've had a lot on my mind.  The trip, my work, my relationships with others... most importantly if I am living the way God is calling me to.  A niggling feeling in my heart has been telling me that lately I'm not doing as good of a job as I could.  So I figured a little bit of inspiration couldn't hurt to help me do my very best in everything.  But especially my spiritual focus.  Pray for me, would ya?

      I am going to a cabin in Hocking Hills this weekend for the 4th of July.  Mind you, I love camping, but I dislike the fact that my entire fridge and most of my kitchen is COVERED in food for this weekend.  But... all that food only cost about $115 for three days to feed 8 people.  Hehee.  I'm a bargain shopping, meun planning genius!  However, all my anxiety about making sure I had everything for food, and my clothes, and life in general meant I only slept for an hour and a half last night.  I can barely keep my eyes open, so I'm sure once I get in someone's car, I'll be asleep.  Thank goodness I don't have to drive.  Just need to make it about another hour of work.  My new blog template is becoming more familiar, though I have yet to figure out how to add links to the sidebar in the new code.  I'm not too concerned about it, since I know I'll figure it out eventually.  I'm currently rereading a fantastic book -- "Pierced by a Sword."  It's an endtimes novel with a Marian Catholic twist.  Very good, very realistic in it's portrayal of the layman and the clergy's struggle with life and being Catholic.  Especially in turbulent times (like these).  I haven't read any of the "Left Behind" series, but it's along a similar genre, except that it's pre-Rapture events and is told in a piece-wise fashion, so you are introduced to events taking place to various characters at the same time.  Sort of a pluripresent author perspective, which is interesting.  Pick up a copy at  urlLink www.catholicity.com  for a small donation.  At the very least, it might give you some insight into what goes on inside a Catholic's head on a typical or not-so-typical day.

      I changed my template.  I think it more accurately fits "me" now.  What do you think?

      I am weekend-ed OUT.  I went to a wedding on Saturday with Steve.  See my previous post for my opinion on society's commercialization of marriage.  That being said... I DO love going to the weddings of people I care about.  It's fun to see them happy, to help them celebrate -- free food, free drinks, music and dancing.  It's a good time.  This wedding was great - simple, fun, small (-ish).  The food was good, the band was awesome.  Steve and I knew a lot of people, so it was fun aside from being there for the bride and groom (both my friends).  Stayed til the very very end... and then promptly crashed.  Got up Sunday morning, went for a swim, packed up and headed to my parent's house (since it was an hour from the wedding, and I never see them...).  Had a great dinner and then headed back to C-bus.  Mind you, this was a lot of driving to be had in one weekend, which I knew.  My body decided to fool me into thinking I would be okay.  Then we got just short of Akron, and I started to crash.  So I stopped, got some more caffeine, took a break, and was okay after that with some tunes playing.  Made it home not too late, but all I really wanted to do yesterday and today was to sleep on the couch.  But I'm at work.  Getting stuff done.  I have to pack this week.  REALLY.  I'm moving Saturday, so this is IT.  LAST BLOODY CHANCE.  I did a little this morning before work to get my motor running... and I have a LOT more to do.  I've decided what I'm going to do is set aside everything I will need for the next week (clothes, toiletries, coffee mug), and pack/move everything else.  My lamps, electronics, and big furniture will stay where they are til Saturday, when my friends are helping me move all of that (since I don't have a truck... my friend Jim is lending his truck and trailer and biceps to my cause.).  Whatever I can fit in my car WILL get in my car and move to my new house ... starting today.  There's no time like the present!
