      so today was one of those average days that i usually have whilst sitting around grenfell doing dick all. slept in until aprox 11 this morning when jen woke me up. she was just in for the day from ketepwa and came for a visit. mom also asigned me some chores to do this afternoon, so i cranked on some tunage and enjoyed myself while vacuuming, sweeping, cleaning bathroom and "oh so enjoyable picking poops", gotta love dogs. then this evening our "youth choir" had a practice in order to make some songs which we are going to sing for pastor choi's wedding reception, half decent. however, that "half decent" thinking was totally shot when we started singing and sounded slightly worse than that. i figure we should never plan on making a living off of it anyways. we suck bad.       anyways, after this me and brenda went for coffee, came back home and watched, yet another chick flick, and brenda like her moronic self, fell off the chair again. (i swear this girl has problems) lol. but now it is late and writing in this blog is totally interfeering with my beauty sleep, so it is definatly time for me to leave.

      Today i slept in until noon. It was great. I think it was the first time all summer. Although i felt totally sluggish the rest of the day... it was so worth it! I then wrote some letters to some friends, good old snail mail. I figure the only way to get some is to send some. So thats what i did. Then this evening the "Beautification of Grenfell Committee" (lame) put on a hamburger supper which I attended with the parentals. They are trying to raise money to make Grenfell a beautiful place...and yet everybody knows that grenfell is the coolest place to be anyways....     Anyways its time to go enjoy my night, so until next... keep fit and have fun!  later days Hailey

      This morning got off to a good start as i headed out to remove boogers,  grimy handprints and who know what other nasty things... off of the grenfell high school walls. thats right, it was back to work time for this custodian. It was only a half dayof work today which was great!...now dont get me wrong, its not that i dont absolutley love wiping unidentifiable  grime  off of bathroom walls.. but sometimes you need a break!         After lunch i then joined my mother in picking and shelling peas. This could be classified as one of my favorite summer activies.  I am not the only one who loves garden peas either...emily sat wide eyed with a pool of drool on the floor, staring up at me ready to snatch up anything that hit the ground.         After this i relaxed and finished off my day with a coffee, a cruise in the Astro with some friends, and cleaning my room.  Not what you would call the most fascinating day, but it works.  later days hailey

      Well, I got home late this afternoon and since then have done nothing slightly interesting. Last night we stayed at Grampa Jims in Saskatoon. It was good times.  I realize that while I would love to live in the mountains and by the ocean there is definatly an "at home" feeling when i get back to the prairies. (as much as i hate to admit it that is)          We picked up Emily from the kennels outside of Melville and she howled and cried the whole way home. Looks like somebody missed me! haha or just mom and dad knowing how emily feels about me. Anyways once we got home i went over to a friends house to pick up the fish and the guinea pig. All the livestalk is still alive and kickin, so its all good.         Now my plans for the rest of the evening are to unpack, have a shower and i might just hit up the ESSO for a coffee! It's been two weeks since i've been and i think i am going through withdrawel.  later days, Hailey

      Okay so here it is... my first ever blog. And all this time i liked to think that blogging was a lame activity only done by nerds. however, everyone else is doing it! I have been peer pressured into doing one as well. so here i am just a typing away on my B.I.L's (brother in law for those of you who do not belong to the fam and our strange lingo) computer. In kitimat B.C!! who would have thought. So far on our familiy holidays we have been to parksville to visit one sister and then traveled all way out here to kitimat to visit more kin folk. this past week, i have traveled through mountains, rode a ferry, swam in the ocean, held a starfish, dug up a gooey duck which slightly resembled something else (right kirb, lol) and seen so much more amazing things. My personal favorties were cathedral grove and all the beautiful waterfalls. as my family holidays are winding down however i am reminded how close the summer is to winding down as well. what a depressing thought. anyways off i go to eat supper and explore somemore of beautiful british columbia!  later days
