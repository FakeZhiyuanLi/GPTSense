      Well, I'm back, after forgetting my username, but not password.  Shouldn't they put some kind of username retrieval thing in that uses the password, since they APPARENTLY don't know how to send me an e-mail containing both my username and password.  So, anyway, the point is, I am back.  And, I STILL don't know what to write.  I'm very confused, with all you people, but I'm too annoyed right now to worry about being confused.  I do NOT want to read my freaking literature ending in front of my freaking class.  What kind of messed up idea is that, Mrs. Watts?  I HATE READING STUFF IN FRONT OF THE CLASS.  IT SUCKS!  Not to mention, I hate this computer.  It never. freaking. WORKS! It keeps telling me that on subprofile, my password is invalid.  Then, the next day I'll go in, put the same info in again, and it works.  Like magic... yeah, right!  DemoB is outside driving around in our go-kart.  I like our go-kart.  But, I crashed it, as many of you well know.  Right into a barbed-wire fence because it was slick.  A word of warning:  Do not attempt to make 90 degree turns next to a barbed-wire fence 20 minutes after it has rained.  Trust me, it DOES NOT WORK.  You SLIDE into the fence.  And cut your leg open.  And it hurts.  And, that is all I have to say.  Bye!  ~JACK SPARROW~

      *SIGH* I don't know if my day went really well or not.  I mean.. seriously.  I had the mass at the cathedral... no big deal.  Then I came back to school for the luncheon, which really pissed me off.  RAMON AND IAN SAT AT THE TABLE AND THEY WEREN'T WANTED!! AHHH!! I HATE THEM SO MUCH!!!  Jesus Christ died and saved us all!! I just wanna hit them so bad.  But, I shall resist.  Yea.. then I went to grandmama's.. and we talked about World War II and the concentration camps for like three hours... it was really quite interesting.  Then I came home and then left like right away for practice, which was rather violent.  Then, I came home, and you know what?  Ramon called me a loser!! OMG!! I AM NOT A LOSER, HE IS!! AND, DON'T PROTECT HIM, ABBY!! HE'S A LOSER, AND YOU KNOW IT!  That's all I got.  I just wanna say hello to everybody out there!! HI EVERYBODY!! And, I'd like to give a special shout out to my love Hillary.  Hello, my love! I love you so incredibly much!  That's all I got.  Buh Bye everyone!!  ~JACK SPARROW~

      Well, great.  Wonderful, terrific, incredible, fabulous, I don't really care what you say.  NONE of those words described my trip to Indianapolis today.  Now, it wasn't that bad, but I really didn't do anything.  I was up early and almost fell asleep on the bus (which was the best part).  And, my contacts hurt.  MIchael and I are talking about bubbly.  I'm not sure why though.  I think it's because of the launch of the new blogger and I saw the headline and I just decided to talk about that.  I don't DRINK the bubbly, but it's fun to pop the corks.  I shot myself in the foot once though.  That hurt.  I really don't have anything incredibly amusing or exciting to say here right now.  I'm just writing for the sake of writing.  So I'll wrap it up here.  Thank you and goodnight!  ~JACK SPARROW~

      Blah blah blah... so who ever has anything to say when they write in here? I don't know if I actually do.  I just sort of write for the sake of writing.  I just need to write.  Writewritewritewritewrite!  Oh yea!  Well, we're going to Indy tomorrow.  Joy! The bus ride'll be the best part, though, I kind of wish we could have had co-ed buses.  Oh well, you can't always get what you want, can you?  No, Michael, you can't.  Regardless of what you think.  That's right, go pout now.  Buhhhh bye.  We have that mass thingy at the Cathedral on Wednesday.  Oh, boo.  Upside, we don't have to go to school. At all.  We get lunch catered by Casa's.  I like food.  GIVE ME FOOD!  You know, I think that I could actually go for some more dessert, though I ate like half an apple pie earlier.  I'm gonna be so fat tomorrow... I weigh 136 and that's big enough for me.  I think I'll go on a diet.   I do like this new template, regardless of what anyone else thinks.  It's great, so if you don't like it, I don't care so there!  And, I rhymed.  That NEVER happens.  Arrrgghhh... I have to get up at FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE FREAKING MORNING.  I'm sorry, St. Charlie's, but that is just TOO EARLY FOR ME.  But, I get out of a Tuesday schedule, you say?  Yeah, that lessens the bad, I suppose.  But that is still REALLY REALLY early.  Well, I have to go to bed now, so I will.  I just want to say that I adore going to sleep at night.  Do not ask me, do not question me.  Good night!  ~JACK SPARROW~

      HAHA!! I have a list of isms, which I like to call Michael-isms, below.  I believe they are pretty funny.    Michael-isms   1.) "If I don't get my way, everyone suffers."  2.) "Comfort the disturbed.  Disturb the comfortable."  3.) "I'm not spoiled.  I just get my way.  ALLLL the time."  4.) "Well, fine!  I'm making this ******* webpage for you, you could at least put a song in there for me."  5.)"When I cry, you can't hear me because I'm screaming.  It's mostly because I don't get my way."  6.)"I'm gonna have resposibilities when I get older.  That is gonna so suck."  7.) MICHAEL: Is there really a man on the moon?      BRANDON: (sarcastic tone) Yes, Michael.  There is a guy living on the moon.      MICHAEL: You never know...  8.) Now, whoever thought the moon was made of cheese?  Like, seriously!  9.) You can be the center of the universe, as long as the world revolves around me."   I shall update this page as more isms become available.  ~JACK SPARROW~

      *yawn* I'm tired.  I had a very... interesting evening.  I had to negotiate with everyone about a movie that I never ended up having to go to.  I went to my baseball game that wasn't rained out.  And about that baseball game.  Everything sucked up until about the fifth inning.  And even that inning sucked too, except for the fact that I hit a home run.  But, we still lost 7-3.  Who cares though? I hit a home run, which was the best thing that happened to the team all game.  That's all I really wanted to say so now I have to go finish the lawn. Bye.  ~JACK SPARROW~

      I'm bored again... so what else is new?  I have practice at 6:00 and running until 7:30, but I still have to leave in six minutes (4:30).  May Crowning... I liked the crowning, disliked the rosary.  It interrupted my gym class, but it was worth it.  Well... hmm.  Yeah, I don't even know what I'm doing here, I don't have anything to write.  Michael had a box of matches and he gave me one.  Then, I gave it back to him and he tried to strike it.  That didn't exactly work all that well.  My desk didn't exactly have the texture it needed.  Hillary's sister is bothering me... she needs to go away.  GO AWAY, MADDY!  That's better.  I'm kinda sick to my stomach right now... no need to worry though, I'll be all better later.  I have a game tomorrow, against College Prospects.  Oh, joy.  And, I'm the starting pitcher (i think).  Then, I have a game Friday and I don't get to go to the dance or the movies at the least.  I should stop complaining.  No, I should just shut up all together for the time being.  I sound a lot smarter when I stop talking.  Yeah! Bye.  ~JACK SPARROW~

      Hey again.  WOW!  This "No Good Deed" song is CREEPY!  Idina Menzel has a wonderful voice.  I love it! *sings along*  Well, that was somewhat happy.  The rest of my day, unfortunately, has not been so.  This whole "thing" is tearing everyone apart and I just can't stand it anymore.  Michael's right, bad things continue to happen, over and over, back to back.  Can't everything just be all peaceful?  That would be nice.  But, you know what?  Such is not, and from the looks of things, such will never be.  Sadly.  Oh well, what am I complaining about?  I don't even know what the problem IS.  But, when everyone else is unhappy, I am also unhappy.  The extent of my knowledge knows that this is my fault, because if I didn't exist, this all would not have happened.  *sighs*  I suppose you could say that God sends us troubles to keep us awake with life and not to allow us to become too lazy and laid-back with life.  Who ever said life was fair?  It isn't, as I recently have been made aware of.  The very hard way.  But, you know, God, being the generous, loving God he is, could at least make life fair.  And, has anyone bothered to ponder how someone such as God could ever send anyone to Hell?  Doesn't that seem kind of cruel?  Oh well, I suppose God has his reasons that we won't ever know.  It would be nice if we did though...  Is anyone afraid to die?  I, for one, am not.  The only thing I fear is the judgement.  What would happen if I was not good enough, and I was sent to Hell.  Purgatory isn't something I would really mind going to, if I can get to heaven someday.  But, Hell is it.  If you're sent there, you're stuck there.  Forever.  Scary, isn't it... also, it's like virtually impossible to get to heaven on your first try, isn't it?  I mean, unless you are killed walking out of a confession where you confessed ever single one of your sins, you are going to end up going to purgatory, at least for a little while, right?  Does that tell you something about our world?  How the world we live in is basically going to Hell.  Everything the media and Hollywood projects is based around sin.  How many GOOD movies have you seen lately.  Besides "G" movies and The Passion, I doubt if there were many.  OMG, Michael!! Who ever thought the moon was made of cheese? Like, seriously! LOL  That's all! Bye everyone!  ~JACK SPARROW~

      Damn, I got a lot to say. I just dunno where to start at the moment. Does anyone else know where to start when they have a lot to say? I think I'll just go alphabetically...   Orlando Bloom- Ok, I put this not-so-good little thing about him in my profile, but on the off chance that you all never read it, here it is:  Okay. About Orlando Bloom. You ALL know that I hate him. VERY VERY MUCH! If you don't know that, please, go crawl back under your rock for another nine months. Now, for those of you who have not returned to the rocks, you know that I hate him. Now, I think that I have finally gotten over myself and am able to be around things pertaining to him with acceptable self-control. However, there is still a certain amount of pressure that is caused by him to me simply because my hatred of him is so strong, he is EVERYWHERE, and my hatred is constantly nagging at the back of my mind. There are times when this boulder of pressure becomes heavier and harder to hold, and sometimes I feel as if my neck is breaking. Should I just give up? Or, try to live up to this expectation that I should be able to accept you girls' "love" of him without any thought or effort. It takes effort just to keep a cool head around things pertaining to him. But sometimes the pressure becomes too great, and I'll slip, and I may lash out at you, and then you will call me pathetic because I am "jealous". How do I know this? Simply because it has all happened before. Now, I love Hillary more than life in itself, but then there are some of you who are determined to use this Orlando Bloom issue to make my life a living Hell. Those of you who are out to make my life a living Hell are the people I will lose my patience with most often. And, even though you are the people who take no consideration of my feelings, I still apologize to you for losing my patience. I don't have a lot of it, and I fear that at this point, what I do have is finally run out. There are those of you who DO make the effort NOT to mention him around me, or to go onto the subject of him, two of you in particular being Hillary and Laura. I thank all of you people (not just the two mentioned) for doing this for me. It's probably the only thing that keeps me sane when I have to think of him. To the rest of you who do not try, I am sorry I lash out. I am sorry to every girl I have ever hurt because of this. It is not my place to decide whether or not you can like some guy you have no hopes in getting. I hope that all you girls will accept this apology and will forgive me for all the pain I have caused you. That is all I have to say on the matter.   Gilderoy   **PS** To Nikky and Danielle, who say the "US" group is sad (you're not the only ones but you are the worst): You say the "US" group is "sad". Well, in turn, I say your obsession is "sad". But, if I can manage to get over myself on this issue, I believe you can do me the service of getting over yourselves on the issue of the "US" group. Once again, you are not the only two, but you are the worst of the people who oppose the "us" group. You are still my friends, and I hope and pray that you don't take this personally, but I just had to get it out of me. I apologize if you do take it personally.  ----That was fun, wasn't it? Of course not, but that is the last thing I will ever say on this issue, ever again. So, you've all just read my last stand on my side of the argument. Congratulations.   Cell Phones- Yeah. You all know that I am in ownership of a cell phone. But, there are certain people who confuse "spoiled" with "responsible and mature." For the record, I pay for my cell phone. It is not a monthly bill, but a pay-as-you-go method. The first ten minutes of each day is $0.25. After that, each minute is $0.10. Sounds expensive, huh? Not unless you are one of those people who either: A) Like to spend every second of your free time playing with the VE's, which cost additional or B) You are the type of person who likes to talk on your cell phone like it is your home phone. Now, I am "responsible" and "mature", not spoiled. I work and toil to make the money that pays for the cards that put time on my phone. And it is NOT easy labor. Then there are the types of people whose, though they are on the same plan as me, parents buy them the cards, they do not work for the money nor do they pay for the phone. This type of a person is spoiled. See the difference? I hope so. If you don't, too bad. I am not spoiled, at least not on the cell phone matter.   At this point, I'm extremely tired. However, I am too worried to sleep. I don't understand why I am worried exactly but I have this weird feeling of worry nagging at the back of my mind. I think I'll continue to talk all about all the things I have opinions on at the moment.   Dating at our age- Well, now, I never thought that I would be one who would give his opinion on this simply because I didn't know what I thought up until about the middle of seventh grade. A long time ago, I know. But, still. I had an opinion then, but it didn't seem to be as big an issue until the issue about the "US" group (which I will discuss next.) I seem to remember that when the debate began, Danielle pointed out to me that she, though not directly stating it, did not believe that we should have "couples" at our age. I have to present my opinion now, because I want everyone to know what I think, whether they like it or not. Personally, as you may have guessed from what I have written above, I am in favor of dating at our age ONLY IF the people doing the "dating" are under certain conditions. Now, you can all guess these, but I am stating them still for those of you who are stupid and can't figure them out yourself. The first one, naturally, is they have to be mature enough. How mature is mature for this, you may ask. Well, I can tell you, it really depends upon the person, but the one thing that I will state is that you are not mature enough if you use this just to gain social recognition or popularity, as so many do. The second, and final, condition is that the people have to actually LIKE each other enough to be able to be together. I would like to close by saying that dating is not a game, and if it is taken seriously, as it should be, it is perfectly acceptable at our age IF the conditions stated above are present.   The "US" Group- Haha! Oh yes, this is gonna be hilarious. Ok, for those of you who live in holes and do not have access to current information, there is a group of four people, myself included. The other three are: Hillary, Mike, and Laura. There has been a certain complaint about this, that we shouldn't do things every weekend and not include everyone. On that point, I would like to state that maybe we don't want to go with large groups all the time, especially myself and possibly including Hillary, because I(we) tend to feel uncomfortable because I(we) feel as if people are always watching us. And, as if this uncomfort isn't enough to make me feel guilty, people bug us to death that we don't interact with each other. People, mind your own business, ok? If we are going to interact, we will do it on OUR watches, not yours. Next, Nikky complained to me that Mike and Laura aren't even going out. So what? They are friends, and they double dated with me and Hillary because the rest of you "don't believe in dating at our age." Since then, it's just become a tradition. Plus, Mike is my best friend, and Laura is one of Hillary's best friends. Therefore, it is logical that we would pick them to come along. And Mike and Laura are still friends, so what difference does it make? Next, do you all feel left out? I figured, and you know what? You act as if we never do anything with you. But I would like to point out that you all prefer to do things on an occasional basis, whereas we enjoy getting out of the house and doing things every weekend. If you want to do things every weekend, I am sure that we would all LOVE to include u, but if you act like you have about this, well, I am just not as sure anymore.   Alright, I am done, so you may now go enjoy yourselves somewhere else. BYE!   |->~JACK SPARROW~

      It's a late night.  I don't know how I survive these things.  I guess I make up for it during the day.  But what bugs me is that I can't have something that I want.  REALLY REALLY BAD.  Actually, it's more like a someONE... >>> >>> >>> ***NOTE*** To Michael John Bartkiewicz and Laura Ann Pittenger, this is where you STOP reading.  If you do choose to read on, DO NOT complain to me.  You have been warned... >>> >>> >>> *sighs, cries* Why the hell don't I ever get anything I want?  God is not being a generous person to me.  He'd rather give me nothing and watch me suffer.  Look at this:  And the Lord God was bored.  The Lord God descended to earth in the form of parents and restricted Brandon from doing what he wanted.  The Lord God only did this to fuck with him. -Book of Moshe 1:1-3  and this:  *scolds god* what the hell were you thinking? making parents so mean?  go to your room, youre grounded... no, dont take that tone with me young man, now go! *turns around, smiles, lightning bolt whizzes past head* hey! thats it! im taking away your allowance... yea thats right... dont you throw a temper tantrum, youre 7 billion years old, youre too old to throw a temper tantrum... thats right... *quiet*  You see that?  That's me.  OK, now listen.  What I want is gonna sound really stupid to everyone, but I'm making it known out of spite.  I want to be with Hillary, every moment of my life.  I know you all think that I'm crazy, and that I'm obsessed and whatever, but just listen.  I really do mean it when I say that I love her.  I really do love her.  I do need to be with her.  I really don't know what else to say, but the pain from not being with her grows worse every night, like it's eating away at the inside of me.  If I'm not with her soon, it'll completely devour me.  I just need to put that down.  That is all...

      Well, as the title suggests, I am up earlier than I would be on a normal day.  I'm here, and MobWar.com is NOT working.  I'm angered because of this.  I need to go buy some shtuff before someone steals all my money.  See, I bought this casino yesterday, and I make $13,260 per turn.  Since 9:00 PM last night, I have been making this amount of money every hour.  I have about $180,000 right now, and I can't get rid of it before its stolen by some mean guy.  See why I'm angry now?  My injuries are healing! Like, yay!  My knee still hurts, but the chlorine from the pool did a world of good to it yesterday.  Normal people my age don't generally wake up until about 11:00 or 12:00, do they?  I didn't think so.  Damn.  I really wish I had something of a life... then I would be doing something today.  Haha, but I'm not.  Laura and I started a nice club, called the Club for the Lifeless, and yet another one called the Anti-Anti-Harry Potter Club.  We started an organization that associates all of these clubs under one name, The League of the Eternally Lawless (taken from our rather large disregard of the rules when we wrote our plays).  Don't like it?  Too bad, live with it.  If I had a dime for every time I felt this sad or this alone... I would be the richest man alive.  Even richer than that Bill Gates guy.  Dumbass.  I'm gonna go do something productive now.  Like watch the grass grow.  Bye everyone!

      HO.LY  SHIT  people!  Would.. never mind.  I'm not even gonna say it.  I don't even know why I'm writing here right now.  I was gonna scream but I won't.  There is something, an adjective, that describes you all, but I won't say it because you are all my FRIENDS.  I would only call you it if you REALLY pushed me off the edge.  And, it's nothing bad, before you go all off on me.  So, I'm done.. goodnight!

      *simmers* Alright, most of you people, (ignore this you special few who know who you are) listen up!  I ain't gonna say this twice.  Yes, Livi, I DO get put down a lot about us.  Sadly, I'm not near as patient as you, nor as kind.  I've had it!  I am SICK of you people telling me that I can't make it with her.  Shut up! OK? I know it's your opinion, but do us a favor, and keep it to yourself!  Alright, I don't EVER want to hear about it because I don't care what you think! I will make it with her, and you all will stop laughing just long enough to watch my fist come in and break your face.  So the next time you begin telling me that I can't make it with her, shut the f*ck up.  Got it??  In other news, the street cleaners of this city SUCK!  Because you can't keep the neighborhood streets clear of rocks and debris, I now have an infected knee and a sliced up chin.  Not to mention my scraped arms...  Well, if you cannot tell, I'm in a very pissed off mood right now, and I don't write well when I'm pissed off.  So, I'm gonna go. w/e...  >-Jack Sparrow-

      FINE LAURA!! JEEZ! *walks and sits down at computer looking very annoyed and disheveled, while laura glares angrily at him from across the room*  It's been *checks calendar* 1 month and 2 days since i have written in my nice blog *pats* and i am only writing in here because SOME PEOPLE *glares in the direction of Wyndemere and Laura's house* are nagging me to do so.  I don't really have anything to do/say.  It's the summer! WHEE! My baseball teams SUCKS! What else is new... we're 3-13.  BUT! I am good, the best if I may say so, so it'll be all better next year when I'm on a (hopefully) better team.  I'm all alone, DemiB is at her cheerleading camp *gags*, and DemoB and friend along with mother dearest are at that pool thing.  Have I recently mentioned that I HATE CHEERLEADING???  Whoo!! I just blew a bunch of shit up on that video game! And, my hot pocket's done! *goes to retrieve* OK.. well I'm gonna go mug some people on MobWar.com... bye, y'all!

      Well, doesn't this just suck... I'm sick with body aches and a 100 degree temp and a headache, and I'm supposed to go to the lake tomorrow with Hillary and Michael and the Briscoes.&nbsp; Mom and Dad were trying to be sarcastic and found out that I was sick which makes this whole thing completely screwed over.&nbsp; They better let me go, or I'll throw a temper tantrum.&nbsp; I would do it, too.&nbsp; Just ask Michael. &nbsp; In other news, I had to go to baseball practice in the condition I'm in.&nbsp; At least there were only 5 guys there so it didn't take forever to make me feel like I was gonna die.&nbsp; Which I feel like anyway, so whatever. &nbsp; I hear&nbsp; Miracle  in the other room.&nbsp; You know, that hockey movie about how the USA beat Russia in the Olympics, completely surprising everyone all over the world.&nbsp; Not to say the world was unhappy, they were waiting for Russia to get beat for 20 years.&nbsp; "Do you believe in miracles? YES!"&nbsp; Same announcer who does hockey now did that game.&nbsp; And that quote was the most chilling part of the movie.&nbsp; Gave me the goosebumps, simply because I'm a big hockey person. &nbsp; Mommy and daddy are home with my banana split!&nbsp; That should make me feel better! YAY!&nbsp; Bye, everyone!

      You all know what?  The league I play baseball for (St. Joe Little League) sucks.  I have GOT to be one of the better players in this league and I'm not on the allstar team.  I'm on the presidential team.  Let me tell you: It's BULLSHIT.  I want to SEE the players on that team's batting average come even close to my batting average for the season.  I will shoot myself if they even compare.  Because I know they won't.  I'm bored.  I have a team party Saturday, but I'm not going.  I'm spending the night at Mike's house.  In the morning, we're going to pick Hillary up and go to his lake.  Then, I'm going to go wrestle Steven (Mike's brother) and throw him off the raft like last time.  That was tight.  For the past five days, I've had to sleep in a hotel/my basement/the computer room.  I'm looking forward to sleeping in my own bed again tonight.  Korn kicks ass.  At least this song does.  And Dashboard DEFINATELY kicks ass.  I have to go to Matt's baseball game tonight and keep the book.  I really do not want to.  I would if it was at St. Joe but it's all the way up in Auburn so I really don't want to go.  I'll see if I can get out of it...  That's all I got...

      Hahahaha! OMG! So funny!  If I say what, my health and life will be at stake so I won't say what.  But, I just had a lot of fun at that lake.  It's just too bad that we never went to get Hillary.  It would have been even better to have her there with me.  Everytime i saw a purple firework, I thought of her and what she was doing.. probably having a great time at HER lake cottage... *goes to daydream some more*  That is all... buh bye, y'all!
