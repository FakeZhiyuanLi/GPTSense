      i found out that there are some lifeless people bitching about me. and creating a friendster account to humiliate me.. yay! i would say. because i think there are people who envy me. haha..thanks hyon-xhi. you rock man. heh. hmm, i see i have a good balance between good and bad friends of mine. and i'm proud of it. haha. well hmm.. its late now. but i can't sleep due to the fact that i took a nap this afternoon. well erm this morning in tuition. i was so pissed because my friends didn't reserve a place for me. so, i have to sit on the row in front of my friends. so, there was this girl. a hot one mind you. she sat beside me. i was like woow!..heh olie..if you're reading this..hope you don't mind. heh..found out she was a really nice girl. and i'm looking forward to even more of her..  ever wonder sometimes we shouldn't take life seriously. i always say that. but i don't think that way. i agree with that. but somehow when you live your life you have to follow how the wind changes. i always get blown away. in fact all the decisions you make have to be accurate. one single mistake and your life is down the drain. now i have to change. change for the better. to be more productive in my studies. and most importantly, my attitude. man, this attitude of mine really has brought me plenty of problems. hmm, especially my friend kaix..hmm, i know i was wrong. but it just takes one mistake..and you're gone. they don't want to even friend you even though you beg for another chance. i have learnt to take friendship seriously. because friends are the closest asset one could have. i agree with this completely. now that i am lacking of friends, i only learned to change. and now i realize that i have a long way to go.

      *sigh*. have you guys experienced being pushed aside? or being deserted? i always get that vibe. and its true i guess. i manage to get everyone to hate me. life really sucks. i don't understand my presence here. really. i hate myself. fuck it man. why couldn't i live my life as any carefree friends of mine. i'm lacking of friends to tell the truth. i do not appreciate my friends. and my parents. why do they have to nag and nag about my studies. i know i am stupid..but why? as i am writing my mum is nagging on the background. fuck it. i really don't understand. and as i am writing also, there must be some people bitching about me. sometimes i result in trying to commit suicide. i feel that i'm not worth it to be someone's friend.

      I get a funny feeling, It comes from deep inside. I get all mad and angry, Wanting to go and hide.  My doctor calls it depression, My dad says it's just me. But the thoughts and feelings, No one will ever be able to see.  Some say I'm psycho, Some say I'm just weird. It's like I'm a different person, And the old me just disappeared.  I get really edgy, I want to commit suicide real bad. Then I get a headache, Followed by feeling sad.  I wish I could get help, I wish it would go away. Maybe if I keep praying real hard, It will some day.  -MiNg-

      fark my dad!...why is it that i don't get what i want? i just know it. my parents are so one-sided and treats me like shit. all my bros and sis get what they want; not like me. fuck it man. well, i know life isn't fair. but do i have to be treated so? everyone around me seems to be living their life to the fullest. and me? i'm rotting at home. i get alot of pressure from my parents. they're not supportive of whatever i do. i'm stupid, i know. and i'm not smart unlike my other siblings. i've tried my best in everything i do. i put faith in the thing i do. but if it doesn't turn out well, just please be supportive and encourage me more. i don't think these qualities are in my parents. conservative parents i would say. come on guys? we're in the future already?

      why is my life so confusing? its just overly complicated. i hate my life. i don't understand the presence of me here. why am i created. all my life i'm treated badly. people hate me. thus, i do not have friends. without them, what is life? i have always thought of suicide. i hate my life. i hate everything about me. why can't i lead a simple life? i keep asking. but no one seems to be responding. i don't hear any answers.. why am i here? why am i here? i suck my whole life. my life is ruined. i don't think i can continue living this fukt up life. now i need someone i can really talk to. someone whom i can relate my problems to.

"Back and forth I go. Up and down I move. It’s a rollercoaster that never ends. Not until I shut you out completely. My sanity comes from the belief that I can control the rollercoaster. I hear you singing your song. I see your lips moving in sync with the words you sing... I spend most of my time listening to your song. Your song compels me. My chest rises and falls with the breath of confusion that your song brings. Your verses tell of our story but your chorus I cannot hear. Certain parts come to me as if I’ve already heard the song before... the other parts I cannot hear. Just the lips moving. I just realized that I should spend more time trying to decide whether you sing the song for me or for someone else. In my dreams you don’t sing. In my dreams the words come from your pupils. We connect like two powerful magnets drawn to each other. In my dreams, all the written emotions you composed and we have shared come true. I wake up and run away from the realms of social angst.... I run to the beach and I see you there. I see you in the waves that roll in with great force only to pour back into the ocean slowly.... they remind me of the immense happiness that a single hello from you would rush me. And they also remind me of the awkward silence that draws you away from me. I follow my sand prints back to a familiar warmth that is all I know. The warmth of myself and I console my hearts pain for lack of returning emotions. In my room, I am cold now. I’ve decided to close the window because I can no longer lie to myself and see sunshine outside when it’s windy and dark. If I shut my window, my heart will wither and die. If I leave it open, my head will cut itself off from the stubborn portion that does not understand the thought process. I do not control my thoughts of you. I can’t. But you can. You show up at my window, knock on the glass and smile. I open the window hoping that the cool breeze will bring in a familiar scent that I have loved. But my head mocks my stupidity when you run away after I open the window. Where do you go? Is it so bad that you come back to play yo-yo with my heart again? If I could yell into the subliminal darkness that confuses me, I’d shout my insecurities and throw them away from me until you do not see my window again. And then the course of my rollercoaster will change. I will still go up and down... but now I’ll be down when you’re not around. And I’ll go up when you say you'll be here.... only to go down again when you leave me here, unspoken."    ooh..it was sweet..painstakingly wrote it for her...but she's gone...  (presented this for my oral english test and got a 49/50 score for it! >.

      as i am writing, i just came in to my house from the balcony. was a pleasant and lonely night out there. i looked over the expanse before me. it was cold, i'm shivering, but beautiful. just beautiful. as i am writing also, the clock shows 2.15am. i can't sleep. thinking over what that has happened the past month. really stupid i guess. thinking out of the box, i'm really lucky to be born into this lovely family. and how wonderful life is for me. but i have destroyed them all. wasted my life down the drain. i've neglected myself and other people. sometimes in life, we have to ignore some stuff. i just don't know why people are treating me otherwise. my friends say that i am cocky and arrogant. i hate that. it's just not me. i'm just vague over what that has happened in my life. i feel insecure.  *alana davis - 32 flavors*  thinking over what has happened, i felt really stupid. and now i want to lock myself up in my room over academic obligations. i've been stupid. and i must change. like any human, i vaccilate, i question and i change. these days i'm being melancholic. well not actually just these days but always. i do stuff. stuff that is out of the box. i go swimming whenever i'm angry or sad. i gaze to the stars when i'm lonely. sometimes it takes two to perfect your life. and i want to find that special someone.

      Sometimes in life we cannot be too sure. Sometimes in life we can’t take risk. Sometimes in life there should be some bitterness. And then some love. Sometimes in life we have to be selfish. Sometimes in life we have to be crazy in love. Sometimes in life we have to learn to accept. Sometimes in life nothing we have to be independent. Sometimes in life we have to keep things to ourselves. Sometimes in life there is no shed to cover over you. And that is when Sometimes you have to take care of yourself. Sometimes no one will be there to lend you a shoulder to cry on. Life is hard. We have to take life one step at a time. I have experienced bitterness in life.  No one will even bother to know your problems. People ignore you. You are hated. Sometimes it is just too taxing on me. I tried to commit suicide a few times. But I figured out that life isn’t ours. It’s just not ours. We are living for the sake of god. And by killing our self that means we give up on god. I have learned to believe in god, but not the religion. With that, I have improved drastically on myself. I have learned to love. Although she doesn’t love me, it falls back on me. I have to love her. Without her life wouldn’t be as perfect as it is now. And when I found out my best friend liked her. I was overly disturbed by that. But, to think of it now, its just so stupid to think that way. She’s not mine anyways. But the thing that is bothering me is that I’m the last person on earth to know that. Maybe I’m blinded by love. But, why? I am not going to sacrifice a friend for a girl. It is stupid and not worthy. For now, I’ve neglected my life. Because of this case, I’ve been so crazy. I know people hate me. Not just one or two. But a whole pack. Why am I so disturbed? Why? And now I tend to get clingy on people. I need someone to talk to. But, all I do is just bitch. I have to change I know! Life sucks. I really really love all my friends. I wouldn’t even want to lose a friend again. But, what can I do? As much as I hate to say this, this year would be the worst year ever for me. Because I lose friends as if I’m wasting water. And people hate me. ArRGhh! And for the record I’m also very pathetic and a hypocrite. I say that I hate my friends but, the real thing is that I just don’t want to lose. That is why I tend to curse anyone that doesn’t like me but the real thing is that I still have feelings for them. Maybe life is not perfect. Well, it is not perfect. Nothing is perfect. That is why I hate my life. I hate it so badly.
