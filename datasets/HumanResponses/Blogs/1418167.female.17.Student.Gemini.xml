       Bonne anniversaire à toi  Bonne anniversaire à toi  Bonne anniversaire mon ami  Bonne anniversaire à toi    For those of you who do not speak French, that was "Happy Birthday." Too bad the dinner hasn't worked out yet. Maybe someday, huh? I hope you had a good birthday. And you may have the first Shrek CD but I am getting the Shrek 2 CD for you somehow so we can blare "Hero." I saw interviews from it the other day and it made me remember how funny it is all over again.    Next movie recommendation:   The Terminal . Very, very good movie. A bit long, but overall very cute. However, if you have not seen  In America , I will drag you out of whatever location you are in and place you in front of a TV with a DVD player so that you can see it and love it.   Muhaha  . My evil plan for the world- to make everyone watch a movie about a poor Irish family in Hell's Kitchen, New York.    ANNOUNCEMENT:  My favorite band of all time, Five for Fighting, can now be played on my blog. It doesn't come in very well as of yet, but it will be perfect bait for you to go out and buy  The Battle for Everything , their newest CD. Or you can get  America Town , the CD which features "Superman" or  Message from Albert... , their first CD. I got their autographs when they came to Memphis when I was 14. OMG it was amazing as well as my first concert. So, in order to show the genius of John Ondrasik's lyrics, here is the chorus of "If God Made You."    Sunset sailing on April skies Bloodshot fire clouds in her eyes I can't say what I might believe  But if God made you he's in love with me   Happy Birthday, mon ami.

      Hello all! Welcome to my new blog! For those of you who miss the old one, I am dreadfully sorry but it was time for a change. So here is my message from the stars- my new start, my new blog for all those who wish to read it. You can still check out the group blogs  urlLink Room 905  and the ever wonderful  urlLink DOY .   To start off with, a list of happy things which have recently occurred:   1. Visits from my Dad's side of the family including Janice, Steve, and Lynn.  2. Plenty of new movie experiences including  School of Rock ,  Ella Enchanted , and  50 First Dates . I love new movies. Or really any movies.   3. A new favorite movie to watch! It's called  In America  and you should all go watch it.  Now.    4. CA Pizza Kitchen Pizzas. Enough said.   5. I have discovered a new Broadway show:  Wicked . It's so good. Stephen Schwarz is a god.  Oh and an announcement:  MORGAN AND RACHEL BOTH HOOKED UP WITH SOMEONE!  Yes, they finally have "their men" as Morgan calls it, and are perfectly happy. YAY! All you need is love, you know. As for Katie Camille and Eric, apparently they both have interesting prospects. Muhaha.   As for me? Well, I was at Macaroni Grill the other day with my mother where our waiter was a complete dream. He was tall, good looking, good sense of humor. Lovely. And he had a tie with penguins on it. His name, which he so eloquently wrote on the tablecloth, was  Brad . Of course, my mother and I had a lovely time and I secretly plotted to come back and check Brad out.  Trust me, he's worth it .   Well, after going to the Bartlett 10 to see Ella Enchanted with my aunt Janice last night, I headed into TCBY to get some ice cream. Bad for me, yes, but it was very good. And, it is a good thing that I splurged because all of a sudden, who should come through the door but  BRAD!  * dies from excitement * And he recognized me! Morgan says I failed in this part cause I didn't get his phone number. Rawr. So we talked for a minute or two and he introduced himself to my aunt and then got some ice cream. Lovely. The shocking part of this is, that I was wearing the exact same thing I wore to Macaroni Grill.   SHIT!    Long story short my friends, we have a mission. I will pay any willing person to go with me to Macaroni Grill and meet Brad the waiter guy. I need courage. I need charm.  I need other clothes ! hahaha!    I miss you all and I hope that things will pick up to where I can see everyone soon. I need to get back with my friends again.

       AAAHHH  I remembered the words to Morgan's and my song! Blast from the past...   Never thought it could    Happen to me yet    In this moment all my fears are gone    Trying to forget    The way I felt before    I have found you I don't need much more      Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay...      In this moment    Everything's changed in my life   In this magic    My world is now in your eyes       Standing here with you    Feel so different now    Can't remember what just happened cause    You are what I've searched for    My life's now complete    I hope you know    Just what you mean to me      Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay       In this moment    Everything's changed in my life    In this magic   My world is now in your eyes      Is this really real    Or is it just a dream   I don't care   I know I'm here right now   The past just flies away   The truth is all so clear   From this moment    You're all I hold dear       Oh please let this moment last til forever   Let's just stay       In this moment    Everything's changed in my life   In this magic   My world is now in your eyes       Repeat, End...     Lovely long day today, however, I am too tired to explain myself. Recommendations for today are Catwoman, The Bourne Supremacy, and Studio Movie Grill theatres. Gods, I tell you. Oh and I almost got into a car wreck... but that's another story.  Last night here...  sad.  :( God, I'm going to miss these guys. We're currently watching three of the most hyperactive kids I've ever met, who have destroyed  every room  except mine in this house. Kelly just gave me a copy of Aladdin the book in French.  YAY !   You're home!  And it's happy! I can't wait to see you.  Je t'adore, mon ami.

       Good morning all!  I am reporting to you live from the comforts of a Texas living room, where I have just been saved from watching Barney ( thank God ). I stayed up until 3:15 last night doing all sorts of good deeds... I cleaned out the pantry! It was fun... Paul complained that they don't make a "Nutrition for Men" oatmeal, cause he likes the "Nutrition for Women" Vanilla and Cinnamon one. "Well Paul, maybe someday the world will be fair for men and you can have Vanilla Cinnamon oatmeal. That'll be about the time that American gets a black, female,&nbsp;handicapped, lesbian president with a lisp."   Paul got me pretty well yesterday, seeing as I went ice skating with Sarah. And I ask you, is it right that three year olds and 70 year old grandfathers of 8 are going faster than me? I kept clinging to the wall for fear of falling, which promptly promoted Sarah to come up and go "Skate like this!" Whenever I managed to skate for a slightly longer period of time, she would go " You're doing it! You're doing it !" I did fall once but Sarah fell too so I wouldn't feel alone. Good kid. :) When I came home, I took one look at Paul, said " ow ," and crashed on the couch.   Stephanie came over last night as well and showed me the most disturbing cartoon I've ever seen. It's these cute little characters who all of a sudden become psychotic and start killing each other... ugh it's so gross. She kept wanting to watch another one, however, I prevented it, seeing as she had just scarred  my entire childhood . We also played the "monkeys jumping on the bed" game on Sarah's bed which was delivered yesterday. Dude, the guy who delivered it looked just like Shaft. So as soon as he walked out the door, Kelly and I went "Shaft!  Damn straight ..."  For those of you who have not heard, after Kerry's 55 minute, poorly delivered speech was over, on CNN, you could hear the people who were supposed to drop the balloons going "Go balloons! No balloons!  What the fuck are you guys doing down there?"   GENIUS!  I love this country. However, I do think the Clintons kick Kerry's butt when it comes to public speaking.  Stephanie, Kelly, and I are having a girls' day tomorrow-  yay!  It shall be very fun, I imagine. For now, I have to go get ready to take the girls to Chuck E. Cheese's... and I only had four hours of sleep... kwsuhgtwsr....btw, I made up with someone last night... long time coming, that.    Tu me manques.

       Sing to me a lullaby    My little precious one    And tell me all the stories that you know     &nbsp;   Bring your head up to the sky    And show them all your smile    As the stars reflect so softly on your cheeks     &nbsp;   Lie upon my stomach, love    Your breath flies on my skin    As you listen to single syllable     &nbsp;   Fall into the pillows    As the colors swallow you whole    And peek out at once just&nbsp;to show them down     &nbsp;   Swing out, swing on    Rock now to sleep    As I anticipate your wake     &nbsp;   Hold your arms out when you need    I'll catch you, hold you, dear    And I will look into those eyes and stars     &nbsp;   You are the reason I exist    If only for a short time    I live to see the starlight in your eyes    It's a work in progress. I'm amazed I have the energy to think at this point, seeing as they woke me up at 7:15 again, but sometimes full days just keep me energized and happy. I watched the two girls today and barely had time to sit. I did manage to read an entire summer reading book while Gracie slept. YES! One down, two to go.   Paul and I got into a gay marriage argument. He says that if gay marriage is allowed, it will cause people to want to marry two people, or marry their dog, and that allowing gay marriage will cause a self destructive pattern in the tax system as well as the meaning of marriage. Grr... homophobe. Oh well. It is Texas (no offense).   I'm going ice skating tomorrow! I really hope I don't break anything... My parents both called to check on me today haha. My mother has no idea how to function without me around it seems. My father is trying to promote an allusion of his actually caring.   Thought for the day: Walk around a Kroger holding a baby... it's insane what you get for free and all the comments you hear. Jesus...

       My new schedule for this week:    8:00 a.m. Sarah (4)&nbsp;comes and wakes me, hands me my glasses, and pulls me downstairs.  8:00-9:30 a.m. Entertain Sarah and Grace (11 months)&nbsp;by playing CDs to give Kelly a break.  9:30-11:30 Entertain Sarah while Grace sleeps and grab a quick shower. 12:00-3:00 Go shopping, to the mall, library, whatever.  3:00-5:00 Nap time for all  5:00-6:30 Wait for Paul to get home and talk to me about politics. (Go Kerry! Sorry Paul.)  6:30-7:00 Dinner  7:00-8:00 Hang out with the girls and Paul  8:00-10:00 Bedtime for the girls... it takes a while.  10:00-12:00 Get online to talk to Morgan about how much we miss people.   So as you can see, there isn't much time to sit still. I have, however, gotten Sarah addicted to makingfiends, This Land, and homestarrunner. I refuse to show her the squirrels for fear she will develop a habit of cussing (like her cousin).   laerhgiehg.... damn I'm sleepy. I think I shall go take a nap or just sit and laugh about how many times people thought Grace was my daughter at the mall today. Odd people. Sarah told me I "looked weird" this morning cause I didn't have my glasses. Ah well. At least I won them each a toy in the impossible Crane Game. Muhaha.

      Okay- you know how they say that everything is bigger in Texas? That totally counts with food. After flying down here and being one of the only people on the flight who spoke English, Paul took me to this restaurant called Chipolte's where you can order these burritos. But they're not like Taco Bell/Hell burritos... these are like "YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME PUNK?" burritos. They are  massive . I think I ate like a fourth of it. *falls over from spicy-ness*   Kelly and I are going to go out to California Pizza Kitchen... ooo love. Stephanie's not in town yet but apparently she is on the Atkins diet now. She's tiny. Rawr.&nbsp;And OMG Grace is the cutest thing I have ever seen and loves my cell phone rings. Oddly enough, it is cooler down here than it is in Memphis. Muhahaha. Apparently Doris yelled at the MTAM kids today. I'll come next week! Silly disappearing Doris.   Just&nbsp;for the record, this comes from the most insane case of writers' block I've ever had, while&nbsp;also watching a four year old cousin and making sure nothing crashes on her head. Well, actually a glass shelf panel just&nbsp;crashed so this could take a while longer...&nbsp;&nbsp;    Let us lie here on the green    In our minds let's run away    To a world of simple ecstacy    On a not so distant day    Let your fingers travel down my back    Tracing down my spine    Let the spinning objects govern us    And dismiss any lost time    Naive I was and may well be    But I know how to feel    And as we stay up on the table    I question if it's real    Don't leave me here alone yet    For we still have yet to dance    As a magic tiny number    Brings about a strange, sweet chance    It's&nbsp;funny how time can govern    Such an act I've never known    Can we dismiss the seconds    And just simply let go?    I shiver at a new sensation    Want to pull you close to me    Doesn't matter where we've been or are    All I want is just to be    In this moment, in this place    Of new friends and circumstance    Let the walls come down between us    For a different type of dance    I promise I will never break    Your heart, and I don't fear    That you will ever, ever&nbsp;try    To tear me down, my dear    Sternum right&nbsp;down to the small    We'll travel down, a pair    I will be a euphoric version    Just as long as you are there    I wonder if it's possible    To miss you until it hurts    But for now you can&nbsp;remain here    And I will withstand the worst    Who knows where we have been before    Or where our future lies    For now I will just simply tell you    This has been a magic night.     &nbsp;  I'm sorry it rhymes-&nbsp;I couldn't help myself.   Listening to: Trace,  More Than This     Tu me manques.

      Yay for new fun things! We have two new puppies in the boonies! :)   Happiness squared .  They're so cute I can't stand it. Anyhew, they are eight week old  Golden Retriever/ Lab  mix puppies, a boy and a girl, and extremely friendly, playful, etc. At the moment, they are sleeping so I get a break, which is good seeing as Nick and I stayed up until 3 last night haggling over their names and watching episodes from the first season of Gilmore Girls on DVD.   I guess this makes up for the fact that I did not get to go to Florida after all, seeing as Ms. Beverly is still not feeling so well. I'm still going to Texas on Sunday, and really wish that I could bring the puppies with me, seeing as Nick doesn't really seem to care about them that much. However, I will have a 4 year old and 11 month old to look after, so the puppies will have to wait til I get home.   I missed an appointment with nice psychologist lady today...  grr ... Mom told them I am out of the country and told me not to pick up the phone anymore haha.   Nick and I still haven't decided on names yet for the dogs. We've settled on Luke and Lorelai, but Cody and Cassie are still cute names. Nick kept wanting Shrek and Fiona- I refuse to name such a cute puppy after an ogre.  Won't do it . He also tried "Hercules."  Oy.    Morgan got to sing for Kallen Esperian today. I'm jealous. My voice has disappeared to some foreign place and will probably never return again. Perhaps it travelled to Australia.. oooo ...I want to run away to there...  who's with me?  Mike's sister went to a rave and told me I should go to one... HAHAHA.   If anyone can think of a cute pair of names, please post them. Oh and you are more than welcome to come out and see them in the next few days, should you wish.   Today is the first anniversary of the microburst that occurred last year. It is also Madame Quinn's birthday.  Bonne anniversaire, Madame!    Any word on Saturday, kids? :) Please please please!!! Kate Camille saw Brad....  oooo ...

         Hello all!  In honor of AP scores coming out, I would like to present the best AP story I have heard yet. "bloodygurthang" here is John McGregor, a new MUS alum and good friend. Congrats to all those on their wonderful scores, but I think Jmac takes the cake.  Read:   &nbsp;  bloodygurthang: i got my AP grades today  hezzah875: yay! did you do well?  bloodygurthang: save one  bloodygurthang: on comp. govt.  bloodygurthang: lambuth doesnt give credit for it  bloodygurthang: so&nbsp;on one of the essays      bloodygurthang: i wrote, "AP THIS!!!" and drew something slightly resembling a middle finger... &nbsp;bloodygurthang: and got a 1  bloodygurthang: oh well  hezzah875: LMAO  hezzah875:  GENIUS   &nbsp;  I really wish I had done that on one of my exams. Maybe I would have done better. Sadly I did  not  do as well as I had hoped, which turned out to be a bittersweet thing. While I feel like a  complete idiot , I did say that whichever exam I did better on, I would pursue that subject from now on. I did better on music theory. Perhaps this is the stars telling me something.  *Heavenly music*   &nbsp;   I hate standardized tests . However, I do love my friends. Sallis, I owe you like eight batches of cookies now.  &nbsp;  I leave for Florida on Wednesday morning! Yep, 6 AM, I will be on my way to Mobile, Alabama to see the USS Alabama, and then down to Pensacola to stay amongst the navy boys.  Me-ow.  Randi has taken full opportunity to remind me of the poem :).  &nbsp;  Did you know we can   post in color   now? Ah, the indecision.  &nbsp;  Winding down a country road  The sky a yellow red  I ride along on a light blue bike  To secret&nbsp;dreams that lie ahead  &nbsp;  The strains and sounds run through my ears  In whispers small as string  The sounds&nbsp;just take&nbsp;my will, my&nbsp;drive&nbsp;  Tears no longer let me sing  &nbsp;  Ebony&nbsp;dogs chase me along  Haunting&nbsp;visions of before  I pedal on, I will forget  These dogs&nbsp;will&nbsp;chase me&nbsp;no more&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I stare into the golden sun  Where fond memories are revealed  It teases&nbsp;still with&nbsp;hopeful promise&nbsp;  The&nbsp;visions beg to be real  &nbsp;  The sky is turning orange now  The clouds are blue-gray hues  Know when&nbsp;the&nbsp;tears&nbsp;have disappeared&nbsp;  I'll pedal on to you.  &nbsp;  I'm trying to work on images, thanks to the DOY kids.  Help.

      TGIF, ladies and gentlemen! Now, normally, TGIF would mean "Thank God It's Friday," however, for me at least, I think it is time for a new abbreviation. So here goes:  &nbsp;   T  stands for Tae Bo, which is totally awesome. I did a 45 minute version of it last night- twice! Exercise diva? I think so.  &nbsp;   G  stands for Going away, seeing as I will be doing that starting on Wednesday. Thank God! However, I will miss everyone terribly but have promised to bring Sallis frostees haha.  &nbsp;   I  stands for Internet- Amanda got an sn! Finally! Amanda is my best friend up in Chicago whom I saw over spring break. I shall soon invite her into the world of blogging. Muhaha.  &nbsp;   F  stands for food- I have a new cookie recipe, and I am going to try it and bring it for all my soup kitchen friends on Sunday. Soup kitchen rocks. Even Brad the creepy waiter guy.  &nbsp;  I wanted to post something on DOY today, but backed out and posted something else. Something about it just makes me nervous. I'll get over it. Oh and Sallis? I'm kicking your&nbsp;ass at Halo someday soon.  &nbsp;   I could wait for all the hours    It could take to fill a day    I would stand the test of time    To get your heart    I would brave&nbsp;the nastiest storm    That this city's ever seen    Just to hold your hand for a second    Yes, longer than before    We'd exist in symphony    And the notes would fill our ears    Beautiful sounds just playing    In the night    The stars would take a bow for us    And twinkle all the more    And the man in the moon there    Would&nbsp;be smiling&nbsp;    The grass would touch our toes and feet    As we run along the bend    With a chance to change the way    Our worlds have been    No rhythm, no rhyme and    Time would not exist&nbsp;    Seconds simply tick    As we run into the sun    Just    Smile.    :)  Happy Friday to all!

      No comments on the last two?  I am going to go crawl into a hole and weep . To the sounds of Josh Groban whose voice makes me  melt . (Happy now, Catherine? haha) Oh well. At least Miles is happy with the poem. Ian has yet to talk to his mother. I think I might break out the rosary for this one. I think God's sick of me saying "If you do this, I'll become a nun!" though.  Oops.  Maybe this one last time...    Today is Bastille Day!  I stormed Herb Parsons Lake with my bike in honor of this lovely French holiday. Last Bastille Day, Derek gave me a Celine Dion CD to celebrate it. I'm going to miss little things like that. Perhaps I shall go pull out Celine and dance. Ahh...  No wait! I can't dance! I'm too busy packing! Yes, as of today, I will be leaving in a week to go far away to  Pensacola, FL  with Randi and my surrogate family to find seashells, check out boys I'll never have, and hang out on the beach. Then, I will return home and the next morning I will catch a flight down to  Dallas, TX  to be with my  amazing  cousins, the only people I really love to be around on Dad's side.    I can storm as much as you  Bring the rains and lightning too  I could cause a hurricane  In an altered view of pain  Fire would be blazing bright  Winds whipping in the night Hail could just come falling down And still would not create a sound Thunder would creep along the way  To embrace the night or curse the day Tornadoes would have a job that's kind  To sweep bad memories from my mind A storm to clear my head from grief  To blow away what all I've seen  To somehow form a new clean slate Someday soon before it's too late  I'd control nature just for a time   Even if it's only inside of my mind    Do you ever have one of those times when you just write like crazy?  It's quite fun.

      If you haven't already, read the last post so you can see the amazing work of David Thewlis. It's really quite cool. I didn't want to put his poem on my blog because then someone would come after me for not asking permission. I checked, and my blog can be accessed through Google.  Yikes.    So, for those of you who have not yet talked to Miles, 1) do so immediately because she is an  amazing person , and 2) do so immediately because she has happy news. In honor of this happy news, I have written a poem (which is now Miles' away message... a great honor). Miles has approved my posting this, btw.    For... certain people... A Vision Without Shoes   It's been a time for the two of us  A time of separation But somehow, someday, there will be  A new time for celebration  I think these thoughts out of my window  As I ponder in shades of blue  And somehow you appear to me  A vision without shoes  You run away romantic-like  Cause you wish to see me now  You walk way longer than expected My house is three miles out  I hold these dreams so quietly  As so many people do And somehow you appear to me  A vision without shoes  I pull my door back hoping, thinking And all I can do is stare For my blue thoughts and dreams I guess Have somehow brought you here   I stand with fixed espression Til I get the urge to move  I move without a second thought  To hug my vision without shoes  Somehow I know this is temporary  Our day will come, it's true But now we remain here in this moment And you're a vision without shoes.    Leave comments everywhere!  I adore feeling loved. Like...  Miles: i love it Miles: love love love it Miles: itll be my away message.   My work here is done.  Sleep time now.

       Nice day.  Dad has turned relatively nice, and PATH class was really fun, despite the fact that the thermostat was broken. I'm getting excited about it all. Even the food.    I wish I could retrieve the moon To place it in your hands To let the light run between your fingers  Just like the grains of sand Which run to symbolize the time I have With you and in this life  And yet I'd rather have the moon  So we could remain in this night  Or perhaps I'd fetch the stars instead  And spread them all around  To let the light shine down on us  And let the glow resound  Whatever I will need for us  I'll grab it as fast as I can  Whether it be as big as the moon  Or a simple grain of sand  The size in the end will matter not  Nor will the amount of time  No matter the size, these are my symbols To show that I'm happy you're mine.   I have been inspired by David Thewlis. Go  urlLink here , and you'll see what I mean.  Thoughts anyone?  Oh and Sallis... how do you know about the addicting Halo?

      All hail the return of the Governor's School kids! I am so very excited and have missed them terribly: Katie Camille, Morgan, Eric, Rachel,  EVERYONE! YAY!  I'm sure they all had a fabulous time. Morgan was apparently the choir slut.  Hehe . I saw Eric today which was glorious and he told me that he is directing Barefoot in the Park this year.  Lovely.  I am going to be doing the cabaret and it will great, simple, elegant fun.  I gave Miles a ton of the paperbacks which Mom and I read. She is reading The Notebook as I type this, most likely off of the sugar high from the  insanely lethal cookies  we had today. She and Xander and I had a grand time dancing to her mix in the car. Poor Xander didn't get to steal it though.  Sad.  Perhaps I'll steal it first.     We sit here Silently Watching the ducks  And eating mystery meat   We wait here  Lying  In a dandelion ring Tossing toothpicks in the air  We dance here  Serving  In a sea of comedy  With words we've never heard  We help here  Smiling Seeing it clearly A group of good hearts and minds  We laugh here  Waiting  Random anticipation  Falling over onto gravel   We love here  Reeling  Day like no other And the dandelions sing...

       She lives inside a troubled world She's a porcelain doll at play  Yet as she's pulled and tugged and thrown That porcelain will not fade  Her dress is lovely, comfy, worn  No stains nor any spills And as her world continues to spin The dress is lovely still   The painted smile is forced it seems  As if she's hiding a fact  This porcelain doll hides everything For secrets she has a knack  The paint is perfection, clean, and bright With a shine as light as the sun  The world still spins to tear her down But she won't admit they've won  A symbol of a long young life  Is what she appears to be  Yet sometimes the pain will haunt her still For through her eyes she sees  She sees the lies, she sees the tears  The insults coming fast  The world may never ever improve But this doll will always last  For now she'll sit upon her shelf And quietly greet the day  Knowing despite each painful time That she won't break away.   The weirdness that is my mind, haha.  It's fun to write again .   BTW, Baptist Hospital is the most confusing place I've ever been to- and the vending machine ate three dollars.  Rawr .   Call from Morgan last night!  Crazy girl ..I'm going to jump on her as soon as she gets home. Bear hug her or something. It'll be fun.   I want to go see  Sleepover  in my pajamas. Anyone wish to join me? Or let's see  Spiderman 2 . Tobey Maguire... *  melts  * Someone please come out with me.

      I just saw the most scarring thing ever on TV. I mean it- it was terrifying. His name is Har Mar Superstar and he got on the Sharon Osbourne show and sang a song called "Body Request." He has an 80's perm and looked like my uncle Andy's brother.  I need to erase this from my memory.  This is truly insane- and he's won awards for this!  Hollywood is strange.  Really, truly strange .   I'm not going to Florida. It turns out Diane got the week off to watch Miranda so sadly, I will not be running away to Destin for the week.  I wish I could . I want to go far, far away. Plus I am dying to go and jump into a pool. Even if I'm in all my clothes. Jmac did it at Mishi's! Man that was funny.   Miles and I are terrified of senior year. Truly terrified.  Someone come help us.    I think I am going to go and check my mailbox for my AP scores. I really want them.  Now . Miles, Sallis, and I have yet to get ours. If I get mine, I will go dance in the streets. Even if they are bad.   Perhaps I'll just go take that flight anyway. Meh.

       Day with my two best friends la la la...    Fun fun stuff. Went to Chili's with dad and Nick which was actually bearable seeing as Nick and I put three lemons in Dad's drink causing him to get this funny look on his face when he took a sip.  Muhahaha . Had the chicken platter which has restored my faith in the Chili's franchise. Have yet to try the chocolate cake...  Headed to the Wolfchase Mall to walk around and got Randi to meet me there. I talked to Sallis on my cell phone despite the noise of the ever-crowded Wolfchase and even found him a birthday present!  Hurrah :).  Randi and I also bought a shirt for her bf/ soon to be fiancee ( I'll explain that one later, Sallis ).   Then, it was a few hours of boys. Randi and I ran into Macaroni Grill looking for Brad, but sadly he was not there. Instead there was a snooty female waitress who looked at us like we were nuts. We left and headed to see Johnathon who shot those little snappers at us with a slingshot.  Scary stuff . Randi also did a slightly illegal job of parking...  we'll never tell ...   We then headed to Wendy's, where for some reason, we could not stop laughing long enough to order three frosties.   Mmm.. frosties  . We headed to Sallis' place with frosties in tow and managed to do legal parking this time in his driveway.   Long hair la dee dee...my brother's watching wrestling.  Blecch squared .  Might have to go to Florida.  Randomness cubed . Not that I don't love it down there. Freedom from Nick would be lovely. I told the Murrells I would find them seashells. :)   Once I get back, I'm dragging you out to my house. Muhaha. To make cookies with no nuts. Besides, who needs nuts when you have Robin Williams? He's nuts enough.    MUST....FIND...JOB...   Especially one that doesn't make me say " Would you like fries with that ?"  It's a happy day, my friend.

       Weird...sleep...patterns ...for some odd reason, I managed to stay up until 4 in the morning last night because Mom, who threw out her back, literally could not move. It took us two and a half hours to get her moved from her room to the den so she could sleep on the floor and have me sleep on the couch.  laehtglethgl ... I woke to the sounds of the phone ringing and Derek going "How has your day been?"... " Short. "   New movie viewings! I watched  The Perfect Score , a very true movie about the SAT, or as they call it "Suck Ass Test," as well as a movie called  Love Letters , which I really liked. Turns out it was based on a play, which I really want to find now. We also finally got Derek to watch  Love Actually  which I have practically memorized. Colin Firth...  me-ow .   It's three in the morning, and I'm listening to Rufus Wainwright.  Life is odd .    GRANDPA HAS LEFT THE BOONIES. Thank God. That man was driving me crazy. We ran out of things to talk about when I was... well...  born . The great part was that Derek didn't come over til after he left. Well done ;). Grandpa's still ticked about Derek calling this czech food that he likes "wallpaper paste." Personally, I thought it was hysterical.   My mom saw Brad on Thursday! EEEEE. Must go and see him myself... except I look like shit. Stupid pink eye. Except, it's not so much pink eye as "changing eye color syndrome," for pink becomes red, and red becomes a sort of ying yang between the two previous colors.    Must find out AP scores. Must, must, must . It will determine whether I'll do English or Music. I have to decide  somehow .  I had a really bizarre dream last night. I dreamed that Playhouse on the Sqaure was putting on  Wicked , and that Amanda (best bud up in Chicago) and I saw it. Somehow or another, we were going down a toll road which looked like Humphreys, and these two girls were in the back of the car. I saw Brad as we were getting into the car, and proceeded to swoon as Amanda drove. When we turned back to look at the two girls, one of them said "Oh you mean Brad, the guy who I totally made out with last night?" I panicked. And somehow, the girls also managed to tell us that they were related to the Hilton sisters. They even looked like the Hilton sisters. Which means they were pretty. Stupid pretty people.   Our country is 226 years old as of today.  Hurrah for the Declaration of Independence . As well as extroardinarily long posts.  I wish you all a lovely 4th of July. May you all have someone with which you can spend it. I wish I did. As I listen to Oliver James, and the Pointer Sisters, I bid you goodnight/morning... I have yet to get that straight :).   Au revoir.

      Okay  way  too tired to explain all of these things so I will simply do a top ten list and make Melissa happy. So here ladies and gentlemen, are the top ten reasons why this weekend has been bizarre and beautiful all at the same time.  10. Going back to soup kitchen and seeing everyone after a few weeks. Such as lovely Leila, and Rick, who is unrecognizable without his hat.   9. Baking cookies, which I haven't gotten to do in a while. Man they turned out well too. (I still say they're not good for me at all.  Nya .) They now reside at the Murrell residence, and I even got a thank you from Cody.  Yay!   8. Getting things for the puppies- I am now a Pet Pals member at PetCo, which is basically a Kroger Plus Card, only for the dogs who are currently ripping each other to pieces.  7. Four goats got sold away to really good homes. It's sad and happy at the same time. In other words,  it's sappy.  haha!  6. Watching the old videos Randi and I made over the last couple of years. We are truly bizarre kids. The stories we have to tell are pretty good too. " Why is a fork in the middle of the road ?"  5. I am currently suffering from the sniffles, as well as a major sunburn which I managed to hit today in McAllisters', to add insult to injury.  Yow.  It really stings.  4. TCBY and other sweet things. Need I say more? Cleaning out one's closet is also good, as well as realizing that because of avoiding sweet things, I can now fit into other clothes.   Woo hoo!    3. Movies! God, how I love them. For example,  13 Going on 30  is very cute, and  Napoleon Dynamite , though it lacks plot, is totally hilarious. I'm beginning to think any movie by Focus Features, such as  Napoleon Dynamite  and  Lost in Translation , are just randomly good.  2. Friends and Miles' birthday celebration-  soo much fun . Roemer ended up taking me home, which ended up being a blessing and a curse seeing as we got lost down by Studio on the Square. Friends are so much damn fun... regardless of direction. Miles got a map and cookies and a night out to the movie. Yay squared!  1. It's been a week. Ah,  glorious . And hopefully many more good ones to come.  Well, as I sit here falling asleep in front of my computer, I would like to bid a  "break a leg!"  to all the WSHS kids starting tomorrow- have an excellent first day, and be prepared for the best year of our lives. Senior year is a week away-   wow.       Thought for the day: " You can't date everyone in the world- there are ugly people !"- Alexander Fones

      It seems a lot of people have been incredibly lax on posting. However, I can fully understand seeing as we have all procrastinated. Yes, senior year is about to start.  God help us all.  But I do believe it will be fun. :) And stressful.  I took senior pictures yesterday and managed to have major panic attack beforehand. I thought I looked really, really bad. Once I got into the studio though, I must say Billy Ross is a god. And made me feel beautiful. Hurrah for nice people. And hurrah for the Torrid dress which made us all laugh cause it is so very  loud . "I'm sorry... beauty makes me fog up."  My question for this post is, why must money govern almost everything that we do? I feel like my life has turned into a Mastercard commercial, where they tell the price of things and then say something such as " Spending time with an old friend... priceless ." Rawr.  But at the same time, amidst the financial woes which face us all, I am excited  beyond belief ... excited about initiation, cabaret,  Tempest ,  Cinderella ,  Dear Edwina , working the Voices of the South shows, prom, and figuring out where I am going to go for the next four years. It's amazing how everything has happened so quickly. This summer has been insane.  But good.   Must dash away to the land of the boonies. Mom put an ad in the paper about selling the goats and some lady is coming to possibly steal a few away this afternoon. I'll miss those little guys. Even the one that never stops calling. I didn't think I would miss them, but I already do. However, I have Cody and Casey to think of, and must go outside to keep them from ripping each other apart out of boredom. aeklrjgaleg  they are so CUTE!   Recommendation for the day: Look at the stars. If you wish, come out to my house and look at the stars.  They're beautiful.  Oh and get some TCBY. Yum.   "Et toi, tu auras les etoiles comme personne n'a..." - Le Petit Prince    Translation: And you, you will have the stars like no one else has. - The Little Prince      Je t'aime. Don't get too stressed out.
