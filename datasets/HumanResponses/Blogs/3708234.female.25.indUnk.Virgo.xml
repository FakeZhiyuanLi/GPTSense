      So, I've finally figured out how to get to the "dashboard" thing...which then allows you to write an entry. yeah. i'm a wee bit slow out the gate (as my mother would say...and does..often) but...I seem to manage, somehow.  Things are weird right now.  I feel odd. Not happy...but not exactly sad. Sorta like an ugly brown swirled up mixture of the two. Swirled so much that it becomes an entirely new emotion altogether.  all. to. get her. i always say that in my head  when i'm spelling that word.    taco bell has beef and potato burritos..this i discovered tonight. i'll miss them when i leave in 10 days.  i leave in 10 days.  I hate saying goodbye. Especially when I just did this.   I'll miss them when I leave.   In 10 days.  But I cant wait to be held by him, forever. I cant wait to be his wife. I cant wait for them all to finally meet. I cant wait.  Only 10 more days.  ****  buenas noches, que suenas con los angeles.  (the celestial beings, as opposed to the city. hehee!)

      So. I guess I'm here. Too bad my OD has been tainted. Not that I'm unhappy or unglad to be here, because that is not the case.  What is the case?  Er.  Well. This is me. And I'm here because my fiance (one 'e') is here.   I wont really get very personal here...only because I've learned my lesson (the hard way) and it only gets ugly.  But then...what will I ever post?  Good question...  Stay tuned for the answer, i suppose.

      seriously. what. the. bloody. hell.   my sister asked me a few days ago to trim her hair. no problem. finally today she reminded me so we stepped outside and as i comb it...i notice that its..kinda..hacked and uneven at the bottom. so i ask her. "whats with your ends all uneven?" "well. i kinda started to mess with it." "well you kinda screwed it up." "only cut an inch" "i'll cut as little as possible, but i have to even this shit out. its horrible."   so i started to cut and i cut off about 2.5 inches...she says 3. maybe it was 3. regardless. its MUCH better..and still not all the way even. she still has some shorter the closer you get to her "bangs". but i left that. now she's in her room..BAWLING. so i go in and ask her what the hell is up and she's like "nothing" and im like "are you crying...about your hair??" "yeah. *sob*". what??? this is a person that thinks she's old enough to be out on her own and come and go as she pleases. PUHLEASE. shes CRYING OVER HER HAIR. 3 INCHES OF HAIR. i could god damned strangle her.  so im standing in her room...and she had just confirmed that she was indeed crying over 3 inches of hair. and i looked at her...stunned out of my mind...my jaw drops...and then i get my senses back and i say "jesusfuckingchrist, kid. i cant fucking believe it." and i walk out. stunned all over again.   what kind of person cries over hair? i could see if it was my wedding day..and somehow my hair was really messed up...like to a point that it couldnt be quick-fixed decently before the wedding itself. then i might cry a little. but. wtf?  i'm just...disgusted.
