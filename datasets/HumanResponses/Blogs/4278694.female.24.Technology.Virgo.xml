       I'm not quite sure why, but I have this strong desire to write the stories of the people who have died in the War in Iraq.  I'm not particularly patriotic (the opposite of, really), but I do believe very strongly in the fact that everyone has a story, and I want to find it.  So maybe on some days I'll start posting articles of the war casualties on this blog so that I can research them later.  Who knows?  Might be something cool.

       I just found  urlLink this article on CNN  about a girl that was denied communion because of a wheat allergy.      Dude, seriously?  I thought the Catholic church was having enough problems keeping its members around.  I understand that they want to keep tradition alive (and I agree with that, having converted to Catholicism myself to be a member of a denomination that was rife with ritual and tradition), but denying an eight year old her first communion because she's got an allergy to wheat?  It sounds to me like some exception could be made, especially since it's a  urlLink  sacrament     and if you don't received them you can, like, go to Hell or something.        I was at a wedding this summer (a very traditional wedding in an old Methodist Church) and the bride and groom took their own version of communion with their personal holy food--Sprite and cheese for the groom, and popcorn and lemonade for the bride.      That's something that makes sense to me.  If Christ can indeed be found every where, he can be found in cheese as well as wheat laden wafers as well as rice laden wafers.  Give the kid some communion!

       I've been in contact with  urlLink Matthew Everett , a playwright in Minneapolis who happens to really, really like my work.  Which is way cool.  I've asked him to help me find out about writing groups, grants, putting a show together and performance opportunities.  I think with him helping, I might indeed be able to put together a show for next year.  Now if only I could figure out a way to get my picture up on my blog--they all would be good.      Here's today's Irish feature of the day from The Kerryman:       urlLink Rain Fails to Dampen Puckish Spirit       If you choose not to create an account in order to read the story, it's the top feature article of the day about a goat named Elivs that was chosen for the annual "Puck" festival.  But legend has it that if an all-white goat is chosen, it will rain.  Elvis was all white, and rain it did.  Next year, they're going to look for a goat of a different color.

       The  urlLink article that I posted a little while ago  was about Eddie, this dude that I had read about and then met in Ireland.   I've told the story often on this dude but had never actually taken the time to actually read about him.        What the article doesn't tell you is the really fun stuff.  Yeah, he's an English teach in Limerick, but according to one of my flatmates from Trinity College, he also  talks to the faeries in the middle of class !  She would tell me stories about how he would stop in the middle of a lecture and look around frantically and start talking to the faeries that only he could see.        When there was a proposal by the Irish government to join the EU, the one stipulation was that they work on the roads in Ireland to facilitate trade and travel (and if you've ever been on the Irish roads, you know it's needed).  The road was supposed to be widened between Ennis and another town, but a hawthorn bush was marked for destruction.  Eddie stepped in because it was the metting place for two tribes of faeries, and if it was destroyed the faeries would die out because they tribes couldn't meet up before they went into battle together, and it was also dangerous to anyone who would be driving on the roads because the faeries were likely to attack.  Eddie started a campaign, went to the government, and the road was  rerouted  to save the bush.  Ireland is truly the only country I know to stop progress in the name of magic.  But the story does have a somewhat tragic epilogue, and  urlLink here it is (from Eddie's own website).

       I've never really had a blog before, but have decided to start one for prepping a show for the  urlLink Minnesota Fringe Festival  2005.   My apologies in advance for most of this blog being pretty much dribble about Ireland, Irish stories, and Irish news articles, as that is what I hope my show will shape up to be.  As for the title of the blog?  Check out this news article about the smoking ban in Ireland and the largest complaint so far a few months into the ban:   urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3854699.stm   If you read down, you will see that one of the complaints about the ban is that now that the smell of smoke is gone, it has unmasked the smells of the drinkers' farts.  Dude!  How funny is that?!  If anyone sees any more articles about Irish curiosities, please post them in comments.  I never know where my inspiration for my writing will come.   Later!
