      Well today i had to go to work. What a day. First I droped my hair brush in the toilette before i had to go to work. Then my ride showed up. We got there and we couldnt start rinses right away cause the hot water wasnt on.. so we had to wait for that. Then I went and let 5 cows in.... but 6 came in by accident. So we were trying to get her out. Well, lets just say that didnt work too well. 2 more cows came in behind her. I was holding 1 off from going in the door to let the other 1s get out and i was just tossed aside like a sack of potatoes. That was just the begining. I dont really feel like typing so i wont go into detail. Then i got home and my mom and dad wanted to go to mohegan sun(the casino). I was like no u cant go u guys own me like $175. My mom was like well i payed u back $110 just now so let us go. So we had an arguement. She took me to get a game that i wanted but i still feel like shit. I dont understand, if my mom and dad dont have money, why would they just through it all away at a casino. Well, i need and answer to that question. I dunno. Well now im depressed(yes, im a very depressed person) and im tired. well i dunno what to do and i still dunno an answer to: if gina likes me or not. i dunno.....

      Today was sooooooooo boring. All i did all day is mow the lawn and go to the grocery store with my mom. That was the highlight of my day. Gina hasnt been on either and i havent been able to get a hold of her to find out if she likes me or not. I still have 26 days of summer, which is good and bad. But im accually looking foward to take my ag classes that i wanna take so i cant wait for school to start. And all the stupid senors are going to be off my bus, unless they didnt graduate. More room on the bus for me! Well anyway it getting really old and i really havent been hangin out with my friends this summer like usuall i dunno why. I guess the one that lives closest to me, David, is still playin his video games all day. After we went camping with him and my mom and dad, Ive noticed hes soooo picky. One time we were hungry and my mom was sleepin so i decide to make him and me a hamburger on the grill, and i toasted his bun. Really bad mistake. He said that it tasted like "stove" and so i told him to cook for himself cause im not making him anything else to eat. So then he woke up my mom, which was pissed. But he used to sleep over like every weekend but now barely ever. Well i could care less hes really starting to get annoying. Well im also looking foward to next weekend cause im going camping again!! This time with my sis and her bf, my mom, dad, and me!! It will be soooooo fun, I hope. Well thats it for today. Till tomorrow.....

      Im listening to my new favorite from my altime favorite group, Linkin Park! Its called breaking the habit for those who dont know. The song is so true for me. Now i feel so stupid for what i did and now im depressed. The only way i get my depression out is from the music...I don't know why but it works for me. I can't really talk to ANYONE about it because someone else, besides them, ends up finding out. Plus, I don't really like talking about it...ah who care. Does anyone? Well, anyway, i found out that nobody is mad at me! Which is very good. And my friend agrees with what I did because I can't like someone that i just don't like. Well anyway i still feel bad.. just don't know what to do.. well, whatever....

      In a previous blog i wrote about my situation about my friend that had a crush on me.  I have finally told her that i just dont feel the same about her. And i think it went pretty well. Well, at least we are still friends. Although having gotten that off my shoulders, I feel like crap. But whatever. I did this for the best because if I did go out with her the relationship would have been built on lies and i just didn't want that to happen. My life is starting to turn around... I think.
