       Have I ever told you about the guy who sits next to me?&nbsp; Probably not, since this is only my second post.&nbsp; So here goes.   This guy (Fred - name changed) started work with us 15 years ago.&nbsp; We should've guessed he was going to be trouble when he got offended by us singing "Old MacDonald Had a Farm". OK, maybe we shouldn't have added the line "Old MacDonald was a pedophile".&nbsp; We do cross the line every now and then.   Unfortunately, Fred has no respect for other people.&nbsp; Everything that goes wrong is someone else's fault.&nbsp; If there's a bug in his code someone else must've put it there.&nbsp; Fred's also the kind of guy who&nbsp;  knows   that his problems are more important than everyone else's.&nbsp; I've lost count of the number of times I've heard him say "It'll only take a minute", and then have to wipe the blood from my ears after 2 hours.   Fred   knows   he's right too.&nbsp; In fact, he's always so right that even when you disagree with him he'll change the question until you say yes, and then attach that answer to his first question.&nbsp; "Jimbob said yes -  see  - I'm right".   There have been lots of weird incidents with Fred.&nbsp; For instance, when he got divorced he was sleeping in his car in the carpark.&nbsp; The other guy in our cubicle and I used to have a competition to see who could get in last on a Monday because the first person was going to get an ear bashing.&nbsp; I usually lost.&nbsp; Moday would start with.   Fred: &nbsp;"So, how was your weekend"  Jimbob: "Yeah, ok"  Pregnant pause  Fred: "Well, at five o'clock on Friday I..."  Half an hour later....  "...and then at six thirty on Friday I..."    Jimbob wipes blood from ears.   But this wasn't the worst of it.&nbsp; Because he was sleeping in his car, he would come to work with a wrinkled shirt.&nbsp; One day Fred was called down to talk to a support person about a problem.&nbsp; When he re-appeared he made a complaint about how unprofessional support were.&nbsp; My roomie replied "Well, at least some of us are professional enough to iron our shirts."   At this point imagine a&nbsp;nice red Ferrari&nbsp;and you'll get a good idea of both the colour in Fred's face and the speed at which he left the cubicle.   Fred stormed out of the office slamming doors left right and center.   About an hour later Fred reappeared with a new shirt fresh out of the box.&nbsp; He even got the shirt ironed.   Fred has a problem with criticism, after all, he's always right.   Well, enough of the history lesson, I think you get&nbsp;a fairly good idea of the special kind of crazy this guy has developed.   Anyway, on to the point of my post.&nbsp; Something's going on at work.&nbsp; Fred isn't sitting next to me anymore.&nbsp; While I'm not exactly sure what will happen to him, it's a pretty good bet Fred will not be working at the same office as me in a year's time.&nbsp; He's been shifted sideways.&nbsp; No-one wants to work with Fred anymore.&nbsp; Managers have even refused to manage him.&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I can hear you ask "Why not get rid of him?"&nbsp; Well, it's pretty complicated.&nbsp; You see, management are scared of Fred.&nbsp; They are scared that if they sack him he'll commit suicide, or worse hurt someone else.&nbsp; This is not a fun position to be in, not for Fred, and not for his ex-managers.   So, Fred is off to counselling.&nbsp; Again.   My only hope is that all of this sideways shifting and counselling is just a way to prevent the murdering and killing when they finally do get rid of Fred.&nbsp; I hope they aren't seriously thinking that Fred can be cured.&nbsp; Fred's been counselled before.&nbsp; It doesn't help.&nbsp; It's just a mental band-aid.   Actually, as a developer, I think Fred would make a good open source coder.&nbsp; They think they're right all the time too.&nbsp; They also don't have to produce anything of commercial value.&nbsp; They can spend two years on a thousand line program making it perfect and no-one will mind. &nbsp;They work on their own in dark rooms. &nbsp;Fred could be an open source god!   Hmm.&nbsp; Never had a god sit next to me before.&nbsp; Just this guy called Fred.

        Does anyone remember the documentary series The World at War?&nbsp; Or perhaps the Life on Earth series?&nbsp; What's happened to documentaries?&nbsp; Do we really need to be manipulated into accepting someone else's view as our own?&nbsp; Can we no-longer decide for ourselves based on the presentation of simple facts?   Of course, I'm refering to the new documentary style made popular by Michael Moore and others.&nbsp; I have no problem with Mr Moore having an opinion, or even publishing that opinion, but please don't call your films documentaries.   Let me just state up-front here that I haven't seen his film but that I have watched the television series "The Awful Truth", and read his book, "Stupid White Men", but I'd really rather find out what motivates people to act the way they do - not just look at the way they act.   Surely we learn more from finding out "why" rather than "how".   I doubt Mr Moore has had much effect on corporate America.&nbsp; For instance, do insurance companies make their insurance policies clearer, or give money to people who aren't covered by their policy?&nbsp; I doubt it - but Moore covered this extensively in his television series.   So what is wrong with what he does?&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; But it has no lasting effect.&nbsp; I'd rather know why an insurance broker denies a policy - what corporate governance is lacking - how we can fix the problem.   It's the same with his attack on Bush.&nbsp; Justified as it is - it achieves nothing.&nbsp; Sure, Bush may go at the next election, but there are hundreds of him out there.&nbsp; One will surely follow another.&nbsp; Instead, solve the problem.&nbsp; Anyone can be a genius with hindsight - but brilliance requires the ability to see tomorrow's solution today.&nbsp; There will be more Iraq's and Afghanistans until we can find a way to prevent them.   I don't claim to be a political strategist - and as such I cannot provide the answers.&nbsp; But perhaps Michael Moore's next movie can be about how to stop acts of terror.&nbsp; John Pilger does it, although admittedly in a negtive fashion.&nbsp; Perhaps Moore can collaborate with him to come up with a documentary that really tells the truth - but entertains people at the same time - and doesn't alienate those people who really need to see it.     Now there is a real challenge for him.

       Something happened on the way home from work tonight.  A group of us were turning right into Springy road, and some lunatic P-Plater turned at the "Turn left anytime with care" sign, directly into the path of the on-coming traffic. Then, rather than realise his mistake, pulling to the left and giving way, he continued on his merry way, much to the frustration of the guy he was almost deliberately smashing into.  Well, that would have been bad enough, except that 10 seconds later he was stuck to my tailpipe firmer than a barnacle on a whale. I tried all the tricks to shake him loose, deliberately over-revving to produce unburnt fuel smoke. No luck. Flashing the tail-lights. Nothing. Slowing to a crawl. Nothing. His girlfriend sitting next to him seemed pretty blas√© about it.  Eventually I changed lanes to get some fuel. Sure enough, as soon as I left the lane he was stuck to the tailpipe of the car that had been in front of me.  Maybe he thought that if he got into the draft of the car in front that he would save some fuel.       Ok. He was probably just another idiot with a licence to drive.      In true Jimbob style, that's not the point of my post.      I blame the chick! It's a girlfriend's obligation to stop a guy when he's being stupid. How else can we learn?      Let's face it, if I was in the car with this guy I would have stepped out of the car at the first set of lights and caught a taxi. Taxi drivers are suicidal, but at least I know the risk.       There was a story on a current affairs television show the other night about young drivers and placing restrictions on them until they have learned to drive properly. Basically they were no night driving and no passengers until they were 21.  I'd personally like to see the following implemented.     No mobile phones. All mobiles to be carried in the trunk or a specially designed glove-box that can't be opened until the vehicle has been turned off. This includes all passenger's mobiles.    No radios for young drivers. This kills two birds with one stone, firstly no doof-doof music at all hours of the night and secondly no Eminem penetrating your brain whilst you are trying to listen to some nice Pink Floyd music.    No performance modifications. You've seen them. The Honda Civic designed to travel no faster than 85km/h with the chrome wheels, huge exhaust, and turbos. Nett result; Deathtrap.     Why these restrictions? Because new drivers (of any age) need time to learn the secrets of driving where they are not able to go fast enough to kill themselves, and where they are not distracted from what's going on in front of them. I was no Ayrton Senna when I was a newbie, I'm still not, but at least I learned that before I got my hands on a fast car.    And the secret is?  You are not in control. You never were.

      I want you to imagine two cowboys standing off against each other in a High Noon style showdown. If you like, imagine the soundtrack to A Fistful of Dollars playing in the background.  You know the one, diddle diddle dooo DAH DAAH DAAH. It's on all the good soundtracks for showdown movies.  Well, anyway, if you know the one I mean, no doubt you are currently humming the tune in your head. In fact, it'll probably be stuck there for at least a day or two.  This is the essence of Song Bastardry. The ability to make a tune stick in someone's mind to the point of insanity.  There are a few essential song bastard tunes which you should have tucked away in your kit bag. A few of these include Barbara Ann by the Beach Boys, Duke of Earl and Walk Like an Egyptian. I can't give them all away or I might lose my status as a Master of Song Bastardry.  Consider yourself lucky to be reading this particular blog because you wouldn't want to become an unknowing victim of a true song bastard. The effects can be psychologically devastating. So it's just as well I told you about this.  There exists on the web a flash animation which documents the effects of a particularly bad form of Song Bastardisation. The dark side of the song is dangerous, and should not be played with lightly. For your information, the animation is called "Bananaphone". I will not link to this animation since I refuse to be held responsible for its effects. Watch it at your own peril.  Use the song Luke. Use it wisely. Do not abuse the power of the song. These are the three laws of song bastardry.  Remember those two cowboys? diddle diddle dooo DAH DAAH DAAH

       I have a bit of a postscript to yesterday's blog. In fact, it's a follow-up for the last two posts.  It seems that the guy who used to sit next to me rang the social suicider and told him the effect he was having on the footy tipping gods. Social boy paid his $22. Wow. Not so obstinant after all. Well done social boy. And well done to Fred too for ringing him up to explain the situation.  On a more personal note, I like to play with people's minds. With the hub-bub surrounding the guy who used to sit next to me I felt it was the perfect time to clean my desk. This should get tongues wagging. Fifteen years of clutter gone in two days.  I've already had the girls from across the cubicle wall pass comment on it. And the guy two rows down offered me some kit-kat. It was time for a break anyhow.  I even took down the poster from the first amateur film I made with the guys from work. It was a bit of a materpiece and the missing poster is bound to cause a stir.      Like I said, I like to play with people's minds.

       How do you commit social suicide?  Well, I guess there are lots of ways.  Of course, there are plenty of novel ways too.  How about ensuring that no-one will ever bother to talk to you over just $22?  Ok, I know that for a lot of people that might seem like a lot of money.  But what if the guy involved drives a Mercedes, has a rich wife, and a reasonably high paying job?  If it were you, would you allow just $22 to set your name in mud?  I know I wouldn't.  But obstinance is a terrible character flaw that dooms you to commit some pretty stupid acts, simply because it makes you blind to the finer points of reality.  Ok, so what about the $22.  What's it all about?  The company runs a footy tipping competition.  It costs $2 a round to enter for a total of 22 rounds.  All up that's $44, which for the sake of those short on dollars, the footy tipping gods allow you to pay in two installments.  One at the start of the competition, and one half way through.  They even give a bit of leeway, allowing tardy payments of installments.      Well, the gods were bitten this week.      You see, we are long into the second installment and someone is refusing to pay.  When asked why he said he didn't want to as he had no chance of winning the competition.  This would be a fair argument, except that for the last 7 rounds he's stood a decent chance of winning the pool for getting all 8 games right in a round.  It's like someone getting a lotto ticket, not winning, then refusing to pay for the ticket because they can't win.  He's also caused the footy tipping gods some grief.  You see, the final pool is based on the number of people entered.  Also, the weekly prize pools have been overpaid because of the payment refusal.  The gods are not happy about this at all.  Personally, I don't enter footy tipping competitions.  No good can come from them.  But for those who do enter, not paying your dues is one of the seven deadly sins.  The other six involve cheating, winning, and baracking for Collingwood.  Ultimately though, the lesson here is not to be obstinant.  You should always analyse the situation at hand.  Is it really worth becoming an outcast over a pittance?  Here's hoping none of you guys ever commit social suicide..   ... or barack for Collingwood.
