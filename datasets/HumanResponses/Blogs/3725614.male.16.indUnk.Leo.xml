       Today was quite good started the day with graphics which we used the computers for because were doing coursework, its ok for coursework because we done have to work really hard on it at the moment :D.  Then we had art that was ok we did what we've been doing for the last week (natural patterns) its ok were starting the final part of it next week I think.... the funniest part of the lesson was Paul ellems calling Chris a follower because he is friends with me and Sam LOL :D. English was ok so was mathes, people are going to Belgium tomorrow so we might do a fun lesson yay.  Games was good even though Mrs Jenkins is in school she does not teach us so we have substitutes which is fun because we can get straight into a game, some people were messing about and she said we were VILE! What's that all about... Anyways we had science after that and guess what another practice test WOW! Would never have guessed we were doing to do that ;)  overall today's been good stayed in when I got home because I could not be bothered to go out. Non school uniform tomorrow so that will be fun yay! cannot wait.  P.S-ive found the spell checker.

       Arrr i dont now what to do luckily Carls here with me and helped me set it up thx Carl :D. i spent the last part of the lesson talking to mrs Bond about biking and mr Rock making me turn my billabong t-shirt insideout she agreed with me that we should not have to wear addidas and nike  urlLink t-shirts  if we dont lie then and should be aloud to wear any sport t-shirt as it does say in the shool uniform list :D. James was in  urlLink school  today for about 10min then he decided to go  urlLink home  cus he had a BOOBOO! He fell of his bike on his paperround he said thatsomeone was standing infront of him he went up a curb thing and fell of hitting his head on the concrete owch! but he decided to be a man and come to  urlLink school  but went  urlLink home  befor first lesson. Sam decided to  urlLink e-mail  him cus he fancies his X (kala) and he said to chris or sum 1 that he has a good chance of goin out with her. This is all in the first 4 lessons im now wondering what the rest of the day will be like..... well the rain has not stopped all day and it makes everything darker and i fell more tyred as the day goes on. i was goin to go out with jo and annie but they wernt coming out so i stayed in (how boring). hope tomorrows better:D  P.S-if theres any spelling mistakes sorry.
