      Hey, my name is Ryan. I am a high school student in Gainesville,FL. I moved to Florida from New York in January, 2000, because NY taxes are extremely high and my father likes to watch his money. Still leaving friends and family in New York was hard, but new people and opportunities(I'll talk about them later) were waiting for me in Gainesville.  I live with my father, brother, and Pistol(my cat). My parents are divorced for a number of reasons(none of your business).Our house is in a normal sub-urban substation, nothing special. The houses are so close that you can't shoot a BB gun off the back porch without hitting someone. It really blows living so close to other people, the only advantage is during Halloween. I'd rather live in the country where I could hunt and do stuff.  I am still thinking about were I want to go in life. Right now a 20 year hitch United States Marine Corps is on the top of my list. Really, the only reason I want to enlist is because I love my country, and my father is a retired Marine. I really don't know what I'm going to do after I get out. I think I'm just going to play it by ear.  Politically I am very right wing(the left can go suck one). I am a supporter of President George W. Bush and his actions in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is about time we had a president who isn't a democrat coward and acts when attacks like 9/11 accrue.  My love life is on a low&nbsp;point right now. Every time I ask a girl out she says "no", and if she says "yes" it lasts like a week. I would really like to find a girl who likes me for who I am. I really hate having to change to keep a relationship. If any single girls out there who read this and like what they hear, please email me at young_jarhead14@yahoo.com.  basically I am a normal teenage guy, who leads a normal life, has problems with girls, does average in school, and only wants success

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Audra, I'm really sorry for disrespecting your boyfriend last year. It's just that I try to look out for my friends(like you) and many times you were very upset because of him. I don't like seeing you down, so I&nbsp;lost all respect for Jeff. I hope you can understand that it was nothing personal,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;just trying&nbsp;to&nbsp;look out for&nbsp;you.&nbsp;I am really sorry for any inconveninnce.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Moak, I am so sorry for the names I called you and the lack of respect I had for you. I was just afraid that because I wasn't&nbsp;Cristian you didn't want me to date Katie. Ma'am, I respected your beliefs,&nbsp;why couldn't&nbsp;you just respect mine. That is why I started calling you "Hitler", I just found it unfair that I was being&nbsp;prosicuted because of my beliefs. I'm really sorry for the names I called you,&nbsp;please understand where I am coming from.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;Mr. Moak, I really am sorry for the thing I put Katie through, and for making you worry about her. I know what I did to her was stressful on you.&nbsp;I know because you are in the service you already have alot of stress,&nbsp;I would like to apologize for the&nbsp;extra stress I caused you.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Katie, you are the main reason I made this site. I can't even begin to list all the things I did to hurt you. I was possesive, rude, mean, and so much more. I know you never really enjoyed being around me, and to top it off I made you cry more than I made you laugh. I really am sorry for all I did to you, if I know I was going to hurt you like I did, I would have never asked you out. I really am so sorry for hurting you like I did, It was just that I didn't want to lose you and I paniced. Katie, I really did love you, and the fear of break up was&nbsp;the worst thing I could think of.&nbsp;You were the best thing that ever happened to me, and I treated you like crap. I was wrong, and from the bottom of my heart I am really&nbsp;so sorry. &nbsp;&nbsp; I still have that note you gave me when I tryed to apologize to other time, and I want to know&nbsp;that thing&nbsp;you wanted to tell me.&nbsp;And another thing about that note, I would like to be friends. Just please don't try to convert me, I have my own understanding of god.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Tasha, I'm really sorry for calling you a "slut" and spreading rumors about you. I was just&nbsp;really sad after the break up and I had to let off some steam, I'm just sorry it had&nbsp;hurt you. Just the couple days we when out really helped after breaking up with Katie Moak, and I didn't want us to end. I thought we had something, but I guess we didn't. Now you're going out with Matt Reid, is he the player you were looking for (like you said in that note)? do you play him, and just pretend life is okay? Does he make you laugh? Or is it he doesn't make you cry, like I did? Maybe I just should have gone out with you in the first place, It just hurt everybody. I'm sorry for everthing.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Brooke, I know you probably never see this , but I would like to apologize to you as well. I should have accepted&nbsp;you had a boyfriend and moved on, but I was stubern and to keep writing to you. And I even went as far to call you a "whore". you're not a whore, I just was really frostrated and got mad, but&nbsp;I shouldn't have. Thank you for not&nbsp;saying anything when I called you a "whore, you're a good person.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm really sorry for the whole thing, please understand I just really liked you.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry for saying those thing about you and Mrs. Moak, it was wrong. I did say them to hurt you, or even to hurt Mrs.Moak. What happen was Katie and I had an arguement over Instant Messenger, and she really had me pissed off and it was one thing I know I could use. And then to even more embarrass Katie I spred it. I am really sorry, I know it hurt your image, but I did't intend it to do that. I know I comitted "slander" which is a crime. I am&nbsp;so sorry, please understand where I am coming from.  &nbsp;&nbsp;I would also&nbsp;like to apoligize for my mother calling you a "mail jigilo", she doesn't know you. And if she did, I know she would not have made that statement.  &nbsp; Sir, you a good person, I'm sorry for all I have said&nbsp;and done to hurt you, or your image.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Paul, dude, I'm really sorry for hurting your friends. I was just really mad at them because&nbsp;I thought they killed my relationship with Katie Moak. Dude, you know how much I cared for her, the last thing I wanted was to break up with her.&nbsp;So became defencive, then that become offencive, which hurt people, and destroyed&nbsp;our friendship. I know you don't want to be around me because you fear I will turn on you, but please just understand where I am coming from. Thank you, I'm sorry.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Karl, I know I have embarrassed you in the past, I'm really sorry for ever time. I souldn't have tryed to convince you to do all of those embarrassing stunts. It was my fault for all of them. Most were my idea,&nbsp;and I could have stopped all of them.&nbsp;I would&nbsp;really like to apoligize for the time in sixth grade with Brittany Witcraft, I shouldn't have ever made fun of you for it. And I'll admit it, you're right, you did just trip.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I know you could have just stopped&nbsp;talking to me because of me making fun of you, but you didn't. Thank you for that.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for visiting my site. I am writing this because I know I have done things in the past that have hurt some of you, for&nbsp;my actions&nbsp;I would like to apoligize. I just feel really guilty for all the pain I have caused you, and making a web page seems the best way to get everyone to hear what I have to say to all of you. Basicaly this site is a national apoligie to all I have hurt.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not ask for forgiveness, just understanding. Some of the things I have done don't deserve forgiveness, but if you can find it in your hearts to forgive me please do. All I want is a truths, but I would really like to build back up the friendsips and relationships I destroyed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;My site has a posting for everyone I feel I hurt in the past. They are in alphibetical order(by last name), so they do not offend anyone(I have offended enough). Please read&nbsp;your posting, and if you would like to say anything to me please post a comment, email me at "young_jarhead14", or call me at (352)-271-7751. I would prefer you call me if you wish to contact me, it is more personal.&nbsp;
