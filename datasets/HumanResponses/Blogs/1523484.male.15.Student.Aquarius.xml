      As promised, an outline explaining the details of my senior project will be delivered, however, there are several other projects that require my attention at this time.  Either way, it's only summertime, so my outline will probably be posted if I have time at all during the remainder of the summer, or sometime during the early school year.  :)

       Seeing as how  urlLink Kevin  made his own senior project outline, I decided to borrow the idea and generate my own.  I will post it here when I finish.  Thanks for the idea, Kev!

      After mentioning this project to my dad this evening, he agreed to help me in any way possible. He said that he would acquire materials and devote time to this project as long as we don't put him on the spot. That is, have things designed and planned out as we hope to do over the course of the following school year. Construction will most likely start whenever the weather permits it at the beginning of next summer.

       Even though I don't like  urlLink Blogger  very much anymore now that I've found  urlLink PivotLog , I decided to use it as a clear line of separation between  urlLink my blog of pleasure  and this one.    I wish to use this blog for my graduation project as it requires some sort of log of what I have done throughout the course of time between that of which I have started working on it, and the time I've finished working on it. It is really an excellent way to keep track of things as certain items can be identified by titles, the date and time are kept with each post, and it's really handy to update.    As of right now, all we, that is, Donny George, my partner for this project, and myself have done are our reasons for choosing this type of project, et cetera. We plan to, in the near future, decide upon the location of the rehearsal and the taping and the people in which to operate the camera, host the show, participate in the games, and play the music. We also plan on drawing up designs for the set, which can easily be posted here, and gathering the man power and materials for the job. We will most likely acquire help from my father, an accomplished carpernter, and any others who wish to lend their hand. All will be properly credited via the credits that will follow the programs ending. Other things need deciding upon, I'm sure, so I'll be sure to mention them and our progress in future posts.

       urlLink Kenny  was kind enough to point out to me a new site creation interface that advertises a way to create a Website with little or no programming skills. This lovely service is called  urlLink SquareSpace .  It was a bit goofy at first, but I'm actually getting used to it.  Through doing so, I've re-created  urlLink Platform X  in an all new way.   urlLink Check her out .  Oh, and I've also generated  urlLink my own FOAF file  through the use of Kenny's own FOAF generator, which can be found  urlLink here . Until later, exeunt.

      After playing  urlLink Raw 2 , which is a good game in spite of it's rating on the site I linked just now, so much this past week at Donny's, I've noticed that the theme for I believe the main menu is a very good song.  The song, entitled "Across the Nation" by  urlLink the Union Underground , is quite catchy and very energetic.  I downloaded it yesterday and I still can't stop playing it.  Believe it or not, I'd actually dance to it if I heard it in a club or at a dance.  And those of you who know me know that I'm not very much of a person for dancing.  Neither is  urlLink Kenny  as far as I can remember.  Heh, although I did enjoy his little dance back in the good, ol' days of Mazz's.  Kenny just put up his hood and went to town, bouncing up and down like crazy.  Very funny, indeed.  Anyhow, their website doesn't have the  urlLink lyrics and audio  for this song, so I'll just hook ya up with the lyrics  urlLink here  and an audio sample  urlLink here  (note that Windows Media Player is required (sorry, that's the best I can do)).  Hope you like it.  :)

      I was bored, so I decided to take a look at the  urlLink Friend of a Friend  (aka FOAF) Project today.  It  is about creating a Web of machine-readable homepages describing people, the links between them and the things they create and do.   "Okay, sounds pretty neat," I thought to myself.  I headed on over to the  urlLink FOAF-a-matic , and proceeded to make  urlLink my FOAF file .   I believe I will write my own generator soon, as I had some troubles using the FOAF-a-matic with my favourite browser,  urlLink Opera .   Update:  I have coded up a  very  basic  urlLink FOAF file generator .  Of course I'll expand upon it, when I figure out how to become unlazy.  It almost seems to be - as  urlLink this post describes it  - a "tired standard."  Sure, the idea is very interesting, but no one is really using it yet.  I usually have  quite  a bit of time on my hands, so I may have to play with it a bit.  We'll see how that goes.

      I have been watching  urlLink CNN  on and off today.  On  urlLink Larry King Live , there is this fellow named  urlLink Mo Rocca .  You just have to watch him sometime..  he rocks!  It also appears that he has a  urlLink book  coming out soon.

      Hello, reader.  I am  urlLink Kevin , and my lumpy friend here ( prods him with a stick ) is  urlLink Bob Evans .  We're just your typical teenage idiots..  Well, that is what people tell us.  We're both very interested in blogging, and decided to start up a joint blog again, because the last one we had was a lot of fun, and helped spark many interesting conversations.. Or something like that! I will now turn the ol' post editor over to 'im now... Until later, adieu.    Salutations, viewers.  As  urlLink Kevin  said above, my name is  urlLink Bob Evans .  I enjoy blogging very much and have been doing it for almost as long as Kevin has.  Does that make me good? Not necessarily.  Does it lose it's excitement after a while? Hell, no.  Are we gonna give ya some good content in this bad boy? You betcha.  But that's all I've got for now.  Exeunt.

      Yesterday, Donny called me around three o'clock while I was making a late lunch and offered me a meal at Ryan's for work.  I quickly talked my mother into it, grabbed a shower, and got up there.  Some simple work doesn't seem like a lot to ask for some good food now does it? Well, little did I know, the work wouldn't be that simple.  It wasn't excrutiating, but it wasn't easy either.  We, that is, Donny, Ben, Donny's mother and father, and myself, worked for four hours doing miscellaneous things to make Donny's father's truck look and work better.  Quite a task.  Sadly, Ben didn't get to go eat with us, but I'm sure he'll be re-paid somehow.  But anyway, this brings me to my point.  Over the past years, my respect has been building for those who devote themselves to the labour that their career or life requires.  They work long and hard for little but self-gratification.  It seems pretty neat to me.  I mean, I share this feeling.  When I do something, say, like re-design  urlLink my blog  (which I actually did!), I sit back and look at it with pride.  Working is good for the soul.  It builds up self-esteem, character, what have you.  So the next time you get off your ass and do something, pat yourself on the back, will ya?

      I was browsing  urlLink freshmeat  earlier today when I saw  urlLink fbnews .  It looked neat, but I didn't want the headlines in a menu: I just wanted 'em placed right onto the desktop.  Time for a quick hack, eh?  I first opened up the script and ripped it apart.  I changed it so it writes to several different files (feedtitle.txt), instead of just one.  This is so I could place the feeds all over my desktop.  I considered adding some of the post in as well, but it just looked a little goofy.  Headlines are good enough.  The hard part being done, I only had to use root-tail to position the files wherever.  You can view the result  urlLink here .
