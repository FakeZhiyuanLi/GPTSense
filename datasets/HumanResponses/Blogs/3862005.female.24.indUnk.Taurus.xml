      All of a sudden I found myself commuting by train again. Aaah, the elbow still hurts as I type. The hurting elbow makes me realise the bliss of owning a car. Arrgh! Okay fine Adit owns it. But still as his legal better half I rightfully deserve the ride I get every morning/evening. At least thats how I prefer to look at it. ;) Husband might not agree but that's a different story.   Besides the massage session(credits-central railways) rest of the day was fine. Not much work got done but at least met saumin. He is one guy I know who would never stop praising me. I might murder somebody but my gujju friend would still say 'Gau u r the best!' Not that i am complaining. To me &amp; Gujju... friends forever. :)

      No. I dont plan to join the Deepak Chopra Fanclub. Ironically this is the first time I have read him. But I have a feeling this is important.  &nbsp;   Learn To Disconnect   &nbsp;  "In order to acquire anything in the physical universe, you have to relinquish your attachment to it. This doesn't mean you give up the intention to create your desire. You don't give up the intention and you don't give up the desire. You give up your attachment to the result.    urlLink  This is a very powerful thing to do. The moment you relinquish your attachment to the result, combining intention with detachment at the same time, you will have that which you desire. Anything you want can be acquired through detachment, because detachment is based on the unquestioning belief in the power of your true...  urlLink more

      Well if I seem to be slurrrrring then its all about the meeting I had with Niki today. I dreamt a dream &amp; now it might actually come true. Tadatadatadaaaaa.... yipee. &nbsp; Ok. Now here is the real story. I sold our first 2 garments a few days back. There have been many enquiries but never managed to get my creations sold. Finally pallo got lucky. So did I. Sold her 2 tops for 650 bucks. Not bad huh? Now I want to do it big. Reaaal Big. The brand might be called Kia.  &nbsp; Kia. Got a nice ring to it... wot say? &nbsp; Then there is Turquoise. Lovely color... lovely name. &nbsp; Not that I am a believer, but the palmists (dont miss the plural) said i shouldn't ever think of starting a business.&nbsp;I always thought that they were fakes. All of them. Anyways who cares. I say f**k you all. I am going to do this &amp; I will rock.

      Can u belive that the above mentioned things can give a person so much of happiness & add meaning to life. Yes they do... they sure do! I am talking about my two beautiful goldfishes who have become the light of my life. Me & Adit -  we go home & we run to our bedroom to feed the fishes... to koochikoo them(that wud be me!) ... to scold them(Adit)... stare at them & look for any changes/discrepancies in their behaviour (Adit again)... to pamper them (me :)))... and so on.  Smtimes i wonder what makes us love poopie & peepoo so much (not that i can make out who's who). Then i realise its no use wondering... just go with the flow! Maybe goldfishes were meant to be loved. God made them that way. So be it. Amen!

      Been planning to Blog for ages now.. but i cant write to save my life... i guess exactly the reason why i needed to start. Read a few blogs today n felt inspired... trying to keep in mind that nobody is ever going to read this... mebbe then my thoughts will freely flow n mebbe then i ll write smthing readable. At least thats how it works when i draw or design. If i think too much about how it will come out... i totally screw it up. Hey where was it that i read... Play and you might win at times, lose at times. But dont play and you will never ever win.  I tell you people are good with words. I mean they just make it look so easy rght? wotever..  not been very busy today... for a change! tried to just roll back all the work i got... still had to do a few things... aargh... but then u dont get everything in life.. :)  gotta go... pray for me... hope i stick to my resolution of blogging regularly

      No. Its not new years... but I have a list. A looooong list of resolutions. :) Whats special about this list is that I am going to follow them all... yeye!! :)  Here we go:  I will -- stop hogging as if there's no tomorrow -- stop biting my nails before i have no fingers left -- keep fast on one day in a week (doesnt matter which god i end up pleasing) -- stop being lazy, stop being lazy, stop being lazy -- understand that there is no shortcut to success (as cliche as it sounds) -- keep patience and not get bored and give up immediately as soon as stuff starts to look even remotely like a failure -- stop splurging money as if i am queen of england -- stop obsessing about clothes -- stop obsessing about my figure -- stop eating sweet stuff as i do all the time all the while -- stop criticizing people and getting them to think on the negative -- stop napping at work for the risk of getting caught redhanded in the act -- follow all the above resolutions and the ones that will follow in the coming week of extensive self examination

      Its pouring n pouring n pouring! And I am in office grinding the usual grind. Trust me... this happens only in Mumbai. I can bet my life on this. No other city can go on n on with this kindof rains and still function with normality. Not that roads aren't disrupted or the trains havent halted, but the show still goes on. People leap over the slush.. land safe... curse the BMC officials... and move on. :)  Beats me... what is it that keeps the city goin? I can almost feel the beat.. the pace at which it moves. And well.. by now u have realised I love it. :) Three Cheers. For this wonderful city n all of those who make it so good.

      Weekend's come n weekend's gone. Lot of things happened.   I thought some thoughts... then had to unthink those. New house would be way over budget. New house aaargh too expensive. New house too much of a burden. But all this makes me wonder. Isnt it all worth? Wouldnt it drive me to work harder? Do better? Debt makes you slog man! Not all would agree.. I am not sure if I do. But I want that house real bad.   This reminds me of the days when Mom did the shopping. Mom worried about the money.. the paying off.. the bills... and all such crappy things. All I ever did was dreammmmm. Wish we could live life backward. Wish life was simpler. Ohh i wish!
