      These days, among other projects, I'm working as a research assistant to a  urlLink professor  at the law school.  One goal of his project is figuring out whether  urlLink copyrights , the regime of intellectual property rights that Professor Cotter argued in a recent article in the  urlLink Florida Law Review  can be viewed as " urlLink memetic engineering ," stifles creativity by conferring broad rights on owners to control the uses of their works.  In other words, will this particular property rights regime lead to a lack of memetic diversity?    The idea is that memetic engineering is analogous to  urlLink centralized genetic engineering schemes , and as such comes with all the risks of such schemes.  Since  urlLink social engineers cannot foresee all the consequences of their actions  any more than genetic engineers, cannot be trusted to be virtuous, and do not have access to the information found in a disperse market, there are potentially catastrophic results, including memetic homogeneity.    So the question is, ultimately, how important is unpredictability in the creative process?  Since copyrights require negotiation and planning in advance, does that system stifle creativity?  Does copyright law preclude serendipity?  Is chance even necessary for creativity?  So if there are any  urlLink cognitive scientists ,  urlLink evolutionary psychologists ,  urlLink copyright lawyers ,  urlLink Hayek scholars , or any other interested parties, feel free to comment at will...

       urlLink Apparently , the creators of the  urlLink hilarious cartoon parody  of "This Land is Your Land" are in hot water over potential copyright violations.  The music publisher that owns the song, The Richmond Organization, seems to think that  urlLink Guthrie's song , which of course has largely been forgotten by people who listen to music, will never recover from this blow.    "This puts a completely different spin on the song," said Kathryn Ostien, director of copyright licensing for the publisher. "The damage to the song is huge."  Well, maybe.  But I don't think it matters.  I think this falls pretty safely into the category of fair use.    But check out  urlLink Section 107 of the 1976 Copyright Act , and  urlLink this case , then decide for yourself.

      I just watched the "Policy Shootout" between Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly on "The Factor."  It was largely mindless, but my favorite part was this (paraphrasing):  O'Reilly: You claim in your film that Bush lied about WMD's.  But as it turns out, the CIA, British Intelligence and Russian Intelligence all agreed that Iraq had weapons,  and now the 9/11 Commission says that Bush didn't lie.  Will you apologize to President Bush?  Moore: No, because he lied.  O'Reilly: But he didn't lie, because he thought what he was saying was true.  Moore: He said something that wasn't true.  That's a lie.  O'Reilly:  It's a mistake, not a lie. . . .  A few years ago I went to see  urlLink Jacques Derrida  speak at UF.  HIs topic was "The History of the Lie."  All I (and others with whom I've spoken about this talk ) got out of it was "A lie is an  intentional  misrepresentation of the truth."  Thanks, Jacques.  That's deep, bro.  In any event, if my friend Casey (who sings for  urlLink Suicide Note ) mistakenly tells my friend  urlLink Cole  that Suicide Note is playing a show tomorrow night at  urlLink Common Grounds , and then Cole tells me, would I be justified in calling Cole a LIAR when I found out the information wasn't true?        Michael Moore is an idiot.  And he's desperately slow on his feet.  Kudos to O'Reilly for getting the interview, but he loses points for dropping the ball on the threat Iraq posed to the U.S.

      Last summer I had the privilege to work for John Stossel at ABC News in New York.  A few years before that Stossel gave a report on organic foods.  To bolster his claim that organic foods were no safer than other kinds of foods, Stossel cited pesticide residue tests he claimed ABC conducted.  Later, he learned that the pesticide tests were not conducted (the tests were for bacteria, not pesticides).  Like most of the errors in journalism, the mistake was innocent.  Soon after discovering his oversight, Stossel retracted the statement with apology, and he still regrets the error.    Despite his admission and apology, leftist special interest groups swarmed to attack Stossel.  A spokesperson for the “Environmental Working Group” said, “Stossel lied and threatened an entire industry by disseminating false and damaging information.”  Many activists even demanded that Stossel be fired.  Some argued that the activists had been simply longing for the opportunity to demand the head of their Emmy-winning ideological opponent.  Others said they were merely performing the noble task of keeping the mainstream media honest.    Assuming the latter was the true motivation, it is curious that such truth crusaders are conspicuously silent with respect to Michael Moore’s film, “Fahrenheit 9/11.”  The errors, distortions and lies in Moore's film have been  urlLink thoroughly chronicled   urlLink elsewhere , so there is no need to recap them here.    The left called for Stossel's head because he said "pesticide" instead of "bacteria."  And the loudest, most obnoxious charge the left makes against President Bush is that he "lied" about Iraq (actually, the    most    obnoxious is the "war for oil" kookery).  So it is interesting to note that no person of importance on the left has even called for a retraction from Moore.  He'll even be speaking with some prominent Democrats (including Howard Dean) at a rally in Boston this week.  Responsible journalists admit error and immediately retract untrue statements, usually with apology.  Similarly, intellectually honest people recognize error even when it exists on their side of the aisle.  Instead of setting up "war rooms" and threatening detractors with lawsuits, Moore should apologize and retract his error-filled film.  Similarly, responsible Democrats should demand it from him.

      I just bought Doyle Brunson's "Super System."  Everyone who plays poker in the Gainesville area should watch out.  I'm going to be unbeatable.  Then, when I buy "The Theory of Poker" I'll simply be amazing.

      With terrorism and war on the front page and on TV every day, violence seems like it's the rule, and peace the exception.  But really, there is a lot less violence than there probably should be.   Though all animals display violence,  we humans somehow cooperate much more than we defect.  In other words we are much more peaceful than we probably should be, given our genetic heritage and the incentives of violence.  I was thinking about a behavior that I've seen displayed over and over again, and trying to figure out why that behavior occurs.  The behavior is this:  two men get into an argument over something.  They each get progressively angrier and the argument escalates into what appears to be inevitable violence.  They push each other, walk in circles, and taunt one another.  Then, for some reason, the actual fight never occurs.  Then, both of the people walk away talking about how, if the fight HAD happened, they'd have emerged the victor.  You've probably seen this before, and I'm sure it happens on playgrounds of elementary schools every day.  So why would this happen?  Well, we all have an incentive to take as much as we can get, to destroy our genetic competition and take his resources.  Fighting gives us that opportunity.  But it also opens us up to being killed or aving our resources looted by a stronger opponent.  In addition to the immediate benefits of conquering an opponent, there are secondary benefits.  Those include being able to impress other potential mates with your prowess, and intimidating other potential foes.  So, perhaps the maximum payoff is not actually fighting and winning, because simply the act of fighting leaves you at risk of losing.  Perhaps the maximum payoff is getting close enough to fighting that you leave everyone with the impression that you were willing to fight, then you leave without engaging in fisticuffs.  That way, both of the fighters can claim a "victory"  to the people they surround themselves with .  It's a win-win situation.  It seems logical that we'd have evolved this way.  Besides "super-fighters" who always win, the genes of the people who take the risk of fighting would at some point fade away to extinction because eventually they'd lose.  I maximize my reward if I protect my resources, and increase my status to whoever was watching by indicating that I am willing to fight and if I had I would've won. In any event if you have any thoughts about this, feel free to comment.

      I already told you what I love the most about hurricanes.  So now let me tell you what I hate the most.  This isn't hurricane specific; in fact it applies to every disaster.  Every time there is a natural disaster, some nimrod do-gooder comes on TV and complains about "price-gouging."  It is the single most irritating thing about any disaster, and often, depending on the pundit, it's even worse than the disaster itself.    Because diasasters tend to destroy things, they often leave people without some of the things people take for granted every day, such as water, ice, lumber, gasoline, etc.    Since these things have either been destroyed, or because access to them is made much more difficult, the supply has effectively been dramatically reduced.  But, because people are left without them, but still desiring them, demand has dramatically increased.  So what happens when the supply of something goes down, and the demand for it goes way up?  If you said the price goes up, go to the head of the class.    None of us objects when we see this phenomenon in everyday life.  If this year's orange crop yields fere oranges than usual, we expect the price to go up.  We either pay the higher price, or we drink apple juice.  When mad cow disease hits, and thousands of cows are slaughtered, those who feel they can't go without fast food expect to pay more for their Big Mac.    But something happens when a natural disaster hits.  We no longer accept the economic realities of a situation, and we demand that the government institute price controls on necessities.  Some find it outrageous that people could possibly be making a profit at such a time.  So they harass, threaten, and even arrest those who sell bottles of water at dramatically increased prices.    I'm sure they feel good about themselves.  But are those people really helping?  Let's take ice as an example.     The status quo is that there is a shortage of ice.  In other words, more people are demanding ice than there is a supply of ice.  Imagine that the pre-diaster price of a 10 lb. bag of ice is $2.00.  Post-disaster, the price of ice jumps to $20.00 for a ten pound bag (some people just go without, others are willing to pay, and the price settles at $20.00).  But imagine if the government prohibited "price gouging," and din't allow  ice to legally be sold at any price above $2.00.  That means that anyone who values the ice at $2.00 will buy the ice.  But that just means that we're back to shortages, and now no one but the first few people to buy ice will get to have it.  Everyone else is out of luck, and since no more ice can be made, the supply cannot be replenished.     But imagine if the market were left alone, and the price system allowed to work.  Ice would go for $20.00 a bag, and those who don't want it for that price would go without (as they would anyway under the status quo).  But those who did value it at that price (say, those with wounds who might pay much more) would have it available.  If that were the end of the story, it would be enough to justify "gouging."  But the story gets even better!  Since no disaster takes out the capabilities of everyone everywhere to make ice, there is an incentive for other people to truck ice into the affected areas, and start selling the ice for a profit.  But every time another selfish profit-maximizer comes into town, the supply of ice is increased.  And if demand is constant, and supply is increased, then the price will drop.  This will continue until the marginal cost of bringing ice into the diaster area exceeds the marginal benefit.  In other words, the price will continue to drop, and more people will get to use ice, until the price drops back down to approximately pre-disaster levels.  And, all the while, people's needs are being consistently satisfied.  Everyone is better off!    Memo to the self-proclaimed do-gooders.  Next time a hurricane hits my hometown, do us all a favor:  shut the fuck up and leave us alone.    **Update**  David Brown has an article that extends the reasoning of this post over at Mises.org.   urlLink Check it out.

      My favorite part of any hurricane is the  urlLink Weather Channel  coverage.  Hurricanes to meteorologists are like the OJ trial to Greta van Susteren: without them, they'd be nothing.    It's always the same.  Some joker from the Weather Channel goes to the heart, er, the eye, of the hurricane and stands there struggling to report while howling, 120 MPH winds blow, ridiculous levels of rain fall, and boats, trees, and other debris fly dangerously close to the poor sap tapped to report on this one.  The guy is always yelling at the top of his lungs, trying desperately to keep his balance.  "Well, it's pretty nasty out here!  As you can see, it's raining, and there's lots of wind!"  Then, after the intense "eye" report, they go immediately to the guy who went to one of the areas where the storm  could  have hit, but didn't.  He's bone dry, and usually it's sunny, or maybe just a little cloudy.  "Pretty calm here," he says, not missing a beat.  "Looks like we got lucky this time.  Back to you."  It's the same thing every time.  And it's awesome.    While the coverage of hurricane Charley does not rival the 21 day snack-fest of coverage that I went through during the DC sniper ordeal, it's as good as it gets when there is no other news.  Plus, this time some super intense reporter,  urlLink Jim Cantore , was telling people to get out of their homes and to higher ground.  He said, "I hope you heard me, because I'm serious.  Get to higher ground; you've got two hours, tops."  He sounded like a professional wrestler calling out an opponent.  To him, perhaps he is.  And his only opponent is Charley, all that is evil.    The coverage is made at least a little bit better because I'm in the middle of a feederband right now, watching my weather map in motion, trying to figure out just how bad it's going to get.    My buddy Ryan has to deliver pizzas tonight.  Gainesville is expecting at least 6 inches of rain, sustained winds of at least 50 MPH, gusts up to 90 MPH, with a tornado watch and flood warnings until at least 2 AM.  But Five Star Pizza is open for business.  Sucks for Ryan, but when I get hungry, I think I'll order one.    **UPDATE**  It's 8:30 now, and no sign of any intense rain.  Bumout.  But the pizza was awesome.

      I am now officially a part of Team Martinez.  In other words, I am backing, and working for,  urlLink Mel Martinez  in the Republican primary for the open Senate seat here in Florida.    For those who don't know, Mel's story is an inspiring manifestation of the American Dream.  I am supporting Martinez because I trust that he will fight for lower taxes and smaller government, a stronger military, and a secure homeland.    The other candidates in the primary are qualified and would, no doubt, make excellent Senators.  However, Martinez represents our best chance of sending a Republican to Washington, and electability has its place in politics.    And given the  urlLink buffoon who currently calls himself our Senator , we sure could use some good old fashioned GOP relief right about now.  If you are interested in helping to send a conservative to the Senate, let me know and we'll get you involved immediately.

      I've been remiss in my blogging.  But it's for a few good reasons.  First, I can be remiss right now because no one is reading this.  Secondly, I've been hard at work on my research projects, and playing Hold 'Em at  urlLink partypoker.com .    Expect more regular blogging soon enough.  Until then, go read  urlLink this book , and come back smarter.  Then go listen to  urlLink this , and come back cooler.
