      As a   BLM   in FFXI my job could be construed as simple. Simply nuke the hell out of a  with a reasonable pause in between spells to avoid getting to much hate. The reason for this? Because   BLM's   and defense will never be seen in the same sentence (except for this one...and maybe a couple more later on). I know what you are thinking. "But...how are you supposed to solo?" Not very well, Jimmy! Not very well at all! Oh, wait. I know. I will just   Bind   than nuke. Great idea! Of course, by "Great idea" I mean "Shut up!"   Bind  , at best, will last for about 5 seconds. Wow...just long enough to cast   Poison   (which will also last for about 5-10 seconds).  So, after pulling 3 Aero's, I am a level 8   BLM  . I will learn a new DD spell,   Aero  , at level 9 than   Bio   and   Blaze Spikes   at 10. Yippee. Than it's time to take my  WHM  to 20. An experience that I hope is far more enjoyable.  Well, I am in kind of a hurry now, so if you are drooling for more info you will just have to wait.

      Well, it has begun. No, I don't mean the gates between Earth and Shang Tsung's realm are becoming one and warriors from all over will be taking part in Mortal Kombat (I actually think that is next Tuesday). What I am referring to is the leveling of my   BLM   and  WHM  in FFXI. The   BLM   will be leveled until 17 for   Warp  . The  WHM , however, will be leveled until 30, so I can use it as a support job for my   DRG   (there really is nothing better than soloing DC mobs at level 55+ and not having to worry about zoning). Starting next week I plan on switching to my   WAR   (currently level 10) and hopefully have him level 30 by the end of the week. Don't worry avid readers. This blog should be updated same blog time, same blog channel (and if it isn't...meh).  P.S. Pictures should be appearing soon also hopefully.  P.P.S. Oh yeah. Please feel free to check out my fellow   DRG's   page. His Blog is the reason I started mine (damn you Username/Password requirements!):  urlLink   Aerocrow

      Actually, don't let the title fool you. We never actually existed to begin with. However, the creator of this blog may be remembered from such webpages as:   urlLink http://mywebpages.comcast.net/SonsOfLiberty.html   urlLink http://mywebpages.comcast.net/AndrewIsGay.html   (Of course, both of these sites don't exist now, so save your clicks).  Anyway, I am now back. This time I thought I would try something a little different. This time I thought I would allow for reader feedback on my daily life going-ons in the great MMORPG from SquareEnix:  Final Fantasy XI . Please keep in mind, however, I don't like people. So, feel free to say what you want because I don't like you already.

      That's right. I say bull flop to all you naysayers. Pictures are up! I only have a few up right now, but as more interesting pictures are taken, they too will be posted.    Aerocrow  and  Xcalibur : The Beginning    Here is probably the very first picture I have ever taken.   Aerocrow   is a   WAR   and I am a   MNK  . Shortly after this picture was taken, we were killed here in   (  Ghelsba Outpost  )   on an elevator.   Home Sweet Moghouse    Here is a picture of my current moghouse. Quaint ain't it?   The Flag of  (  San d'Oria  )     Currently,   (  San d'Oria  )   is in control with   (  Bastok  )   and   (  Windurst  )   as allies.   ShadowsLost LS    Here is most of the gang of my linkshell (except   Zaiden   and   Reyv  ).   A  Light Elemental     I just thought this looked cool. Although, I have yet to fight one and reap the 7k reward.    Aerocrow  and  Xcalibur : As It Stands...    And here we are now. A couple of   DRG's   hanging out with our wyverns.   Lumiere   (Aerocrow) and   Max   (Xcalibur).  As for today's post...  Yesterday night was very awesome.   Purrti  ,   Haites  , and I headed to the dunes and proceeded to build a pt. Within minutes we were fighting crabs along   Siren Beach  . After about 4 hours of pting and 2 deaths (sorry guys), we are all level 16. I have learned   Divine Seal   and   Curaga  . Nice. And, of course, level 30 is that much closer.  Tonight, since   Haites   won't be on (douche), I will be hopefully getting a pt in the dunes with my   BLM  . If all goes well, I will get at least level 15 tonight (currently level 11) and be done leveling my   BLM  . If things go  really  well, I will get level 17 and be able to have   (  Warp  )  , but that is highly unlikely.

      I don't really feel like typing all that much. Not much happened yesterday. I got my BLM to level 11. No new   BLM   spells. No new  WHM  spells (from sub). Meh. Hopefully, I will be getting my  WHM  to level 16 tonight in the dunes. If so,   Silence  ,  Banishga ,   Deodorize  , and   Curaga   all await me. As well as the job ability,   Divine Seal  . Neato.

      Yep. That's right. Still no pix. I keep forgetting to send them to my email account for posting. Trust me. You aren't missing much anyway. No one out there likes  naked, hot lesbians licking whipcream off one another , right? I thought so.  So, what is happening in  FFXI  currently. How should I know douche bag?! I'm not logged in!  The joys of  WHM . How I do love it. And to be fair, I think I am starting to like   BLM   also. Both of these classes seem to suck before level 10, but really, except for   DRG  , this is pretty much true for all jobs.  So where to start? Let's do   BLM   first. Not much to say. I will be leveling my   BLM   tonight, hopefully to 11 (solo...or with the help of an LS mate,   Purrti  ...who actually isn't all that pretty. She looks like she was hit with a couch...directly in the face...about 7 times). But I digress.   Blaze Spikes   makes all the difference as a   BLM  . At 8 mp, this enhancing spell owns (or pwns to you l337 fawkers). With every enemy hit, the mob takes 6 pts of fire damage. I have killed so many rabbits, worms, gobs, and sheep without hardly touching them.  ...And now on to  WHM ...  Yesterday was simply amazing. My half-a-static pt (  Haites  ,   Purrti  , and me), being all level 12, took off for   (  Valkurm Dunes  )  . With level 16 aspirations in my eyes, we zoned into the  "could-someone-please-turn-down-the-sand"  beaches of the David Hasselhoffian dreamland. After a few minutes of assembling a pt, we were ready to start fighting lizards, gobs, and bats. The party consisted of the following:   WHM/ BLM   (Xcalibur)   WAR / MNK   (Haites)   NIN / WAR   (Purrti)   BLM /WHM  (Davion)   WAR / NIN   (Schu...a dumbass for subbing NIN before 20)   MNK /???  (Hana???...the rest of the name sort of trailed off into Japanese...ok, ok, ok)   We were simply destroying these mobs. Each battle lasted between 10-15 secs. With everyone at practically full health, I would rest to rebuild mp. I than received a stern warning from Rainman (Hana) about not healing everyone to full. Shut up, you broken english bastard. At one point, Hana did die, but Haites and I leveled with an  XP chain #2 ,  225   xp  pts. Anyway, once we all leveled (I could learn Slow), we moved onto crabs along the shoreline. While this started out as a pretty good idea, we ended up losing 2 members due to a gob link. It was at this point that 2 of our members (the   MNK   and   BLM  ) wanted to leave because "they had work in the morning." I had to jerk off too, but I didn't mind waiting a little longer. So,   Haites  ,   Purrti  , and myself decided to try our hand in   (  Ordelles Caves  )  . Big mistake. I won't say anything more about this. I will, however, give a big shout out to   Haites   (idea) and   Purrti   (saviour) for coming to my aid and saving me   54   hp away from death while being aggroed and chased from a  Poison Funguar  in Nikes.  So, long story long, us 3 are all level 14 after some worthwhile pting in the plateau.   ( Congratulations! )    ShadowsLost .

      In case you have an intolerance for capitalized words and completely skipped the heading, there is server maintenance today in  FFXI . It is just one of nine (3 servers about ever other day for a month). This apparently is the last update before the release of the newest expansion,   Chains of Promathia  .  So, what does that mean to you? I have time to update my blog since I'm not playing. Damnit. The downside? I was supposed to have pix available for your viewing pleasure, but they are all on the server.  Since my last post, a lot of things have changed. My voice has gotten deeper. I've started to notice hair in places where I never had hair before. I'm starting to notice girl bunnies. Also, I have taken my   BLM   to level 10 and obtained a   Magical Attack Bonus   trait upon doing so. But, something far more interesting, is the emergence of my  WHM .  The initial plan was to take my  BLM  to 10 over the weekend than switch to my   WAR  . Well, due to other commitments this week (including, but not limited to, intercourse with each and everyone of your mothers) I have decided to stick with my  WHM . Along with my  ShadowsLost  LS friends   Haites   ( WAR/MNK ...hell of a tank) and   Purrti   ( NIN/WAR ...hell of a puller), we started partying together in   (  La Theine Plateau  )  . As of yesterday, we are all level 12 and ready to head to the dunes. Level 20 should arrive quickly seeing as how we already have half a party put together. Here's hoping to no incompetent party members!  I should also mention that I was given a linkpearl into the all   DRG   LS,   Lancer  .   ( /sweet )  .  I think that is pretty much it for now. I'd like to give a hearty   ( Congratulations! )   to    urlLink Aerocrow    for reaching level 22 with his   DRG    yesterday.

      Well, I got my   BLM   to level 9 last night. I was also finally able to learn the 18 mp cost spell   Aero  . Neat. I think I have enough tolerance left in me to take my   BLM   to level 10. Than it is time to switch to  WHM . True, it would be smarter to just stay with my   BLM   to my goal of 17, but it just sucks so much. Meh. We'll see what happens. Tonight I will get my   BLM   to 10 than it is time to start with my   WAR   tomorrow. And again, the goal is level 30 by the end of play on Friday night. Although, level 11 may be soloed, so I can wear level 11 gear before heading to   (  Valkurm Dunes  )  . Who cares though really? No one is reading this. You all suck.  Trying to think...  Oh, I know.    urlLink Aerocrow    and I helped someone named  Dargas  ( 30  THF / WAR  ) last night fight the final dragon for the   Dragoon   quest.  I always enjoy fighting   Cyranuce M Cautoleon   at the end. Total match time took 2 minutes 29 seconds.   Cyranuce   was seen running away with his scaled tail between his legs as I intimidated him twice. Yeah, way to freeze up when the little red light turns on, Cindy Brady.    *** SPOILER WARNING ***    Actually, the spoiler warning was above. Oops. We'll call that one my bad.  Anyway, I want to put pictures of my wyvern   Max   and myself up on the site, but quite frankly I am just to lazy. I keep forgetting to send the pictures to my email, so you will all just have to wait. Besides, I know you all like to be teased anyway. And maybe later, I will throw one of my sexy parties.
