      i have this whole image of what i wanna be. but i'm not really like that. its all my parallel life that i lead in the realms of my mind. i have this attitude. i have this style. i even have the whole 'circle' and incidents too. imagination or hallucination call it what u will. but i can sit for hours on end n think up situations incidets n events that never happened. imagine everything down to the littlest detail. n they aren't necessarily the nicest things. my parallel life includes the pain n the heartbreaks. the good the bad and the ugly basically. maybe its the reason for my insomnia. maybe its the reason for my schizophrenia.

      i miss whats gone it hits me now alone and forlorn it never mattered somehow  out with the old in with the new cliched..overrated leaves me without a clue  where do i go what will i be if i had some idea abt wats in store for me  if i had an idea  something to hold on to something that wudn't go away something as familiar as you  u will be gone so will the rest leave me with the memories some of the best  leave me with the days leave me with the nights the moments shared the laughter the fights  gave me all u had now give me all u've got it isn't long before our footprints in the sand will be washed away..alone...forgot

      do u ever realize how u tend to bond more wit frnds wen u  stop seein each other that often. say u grow up together..same school..hang out ALL the time..talk on the phone 24/7..n its just awrite no shit. then u pass outta school...u drift away..ppl go their separate ways..u dont meet everyday..u dont hang all the time..u dont talk 24/7. wen u do meet..u may feel wat the heck its gonna b weird..not so much in touch n stuff..but i realized its the exact opposite. u talk abt stuff u never talked abt before. u hang n chat n giggle n do stupid things n b stupid ppl n its all okie cuz even tho u aint all 'buddy-buddy-you're-my best-friend' anymore u've bin thru it all n its okie to b u..watever it may b.

      for the first time in my life someone is questioning the person i am...the way i live my life..the way i want to be. never have my parents, my family or my friends told me what to do or how to be. In he waltzes with his ideals on relationships n compromise..throwing my ideals out the door...dress like that u look like a slut...dont drink its a sign of weak character in a girl..talk decently..ditch the sarcasm..ohmahfahkingawd. it leads to many questions..too many questions...i need prozzac or i need alcohol....
