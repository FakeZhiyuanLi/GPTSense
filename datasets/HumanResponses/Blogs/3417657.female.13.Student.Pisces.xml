        Hey guys, Today was fun. I went 2 kyle's house. They had band practice. Fun Fun. Crazy stuff there. Anyways then I came home talked 2 Doug 4 a while. That was fun. Then i got off called Brooke. She talked about school and stuff and her lover Preston. She says she doesn't like him. But i know she does. Ya that was funny. Then me and Robert (my stepdad) went 2 Lowe's we bought some stuff for the house. Ya there was this guy that worked there. He was hott. Lol. Ya now I'm at home listening 2 music, thinking and reading my mail from Doug. Interesting stuff huh Alex? Haha. Garrett's on but he's really not talking guess he's busy in the chat room. i'm gonna miss him. He won't be back until wedsnday!I doubt he'll miss me.It's 9:37 and I'm not tired.

And i'm not mad, i'm hurt but in a sense happy. don't ask me.lol i think it's better. because i realized that bleep wasn't the right person 4 me, it's beep(guy). but i like beep but i still like bleep and i wanna loose those feelings 4 bleep (they're almost gone) and i hate 2 say it but they will be there 4 a while.... Confusing? that's what i thought. But u see bleep has these feelings 4 blank that only they can understand. Cuz no1 can understand those feelings right mici?! lol. well that's that. OOOH!!
