       Looking at you  Makes me realize  How lucky I am  To have seen your eyes   The kindness in your heart  Your unselfish desire  To do you part  In lifting God higher   The laughter you bring  With the joy in your smile  Not thinking about you  Is my hardest trial   Being away from you  Is the worst feeling I know  My heart is aching  I’m feeling the lowest of lows   But every time I see you  My heart skips a beat  This warm fuzzy feeling  Makes me run down the street   Being around you right now  Makes me know this is true  I couldn’t have asked  For a better “friend” like you

       The look in your eyes. The sound of your voice. The touch of your hands. The taste of your lips. The smell of you. Transports me to the time when passion blazed like a fire on a cold, winter’s night.     The misery in your eyes. The anger in your voice. The stagnancy in your hands. The bitterness of your lips. The foulness upon you. Opens my eyes and the truth hits me like the glare of the sun.    The remorse in your eyes. The sorrow in your voice. The tingling in your hands. The desire of your lips. The smell of your wounds. Overcomes my anger and lifts it like the wind lifts a fallen leaf.

       The mocking calls of the ravens above, caused me to wake. With my eyes open wide, panic runs through me as I look around- everything familiar is gone, disappeared from my sight. My heart beats harder and faster with every shortened breath I take. I feel like a mirror that’s been dropped and scattered into hundreds of pieces. Unable to move, I search my surroundings. It’s unknown what I’m searching for, yet I keep on.  My concentration breaks with every repulsive call of the ravens above. I search on despite the noise. A sign of meaning jumps out of nowhere like a shadow at the rise of the sun. Happiness now replaces the panic; how a dove replaced the unsuccessful ravens. As quick as lightning these feelings; along with my hope, fade into the depths below, like a mirage vanishing into the blistering heat. The crashing waves now lap against my only security. The motion sickens me so much I am forced to adjust myself.  My destination is so close yet so far. I stretech out my hand in hopes of grasping onto the hope before it leaves forever. Unsuccessful, my hand clasps onto nothing but air filled with false belief. With a splash, I fall from this unexpected abruption. The cold surrounds me, panic takes over me once again with more power than a hurricane. The ravens have found their place. Their screeches suddenly turn into calls of my name. Feeling delusional I kick my feet and move my arms to save my sanity. I grow tired and weak as I slip below the excruciatingly coldness. I manage to surface, but doubt has filled my insides weighing me down. I am overpowered and I begin to sink  Refusing to give up, I push upwards aiming for the surface. My efforts cease to prosper as hope flees my body and the surface is no longer visible. I accept this newfound reality as I close my eyes, with the last thing I see be the ravens closing in on me.

       Just like a thief:     You came.  In the darkness, unexpectedly; very sly, and carefully.      You saw.  Something inside of me; that no one else  dared to find.  You stole.  Something so precious  that no one dared to capture.      You were caught.  In the midst of your endeavor your mask left your face and you were revealed.       You are mine.  Escape is impossible in my captivity .

       Skeletons lie all around me Rotting flesh clings to their bones Frightened, I close my eyes, and I am surrounded in darkness The grotesque images have disappeared, and calmness flows through me My eyes open, in hopes of a returned normalcy in my sight To my dismay, the skeletons have remained and freight returns to my body Blink! Still, the horrific figures continue to pierce my vision  Frustrated and scared I run To no avail, I realize that they are everywhere. I cannot escape.

        When I’m away from you,  I long for you.  I count the days, hours, minutes and seconds  until the next time we meet.  The time goes by like a rose, losing its petals.  I watch the clock,  the hands move like the seasons  and I wait with little patience.  Time is endless, never ending,  I damn Khronos ;  the cause of my pain and torment!  Restlessness overcomes me  and I begin to pace-endlessly.  The wind pushes reality away,  as I continue to yearn for you and I  try to find the key in killing time.  My want for time to pass is excruciating,  Alas, all hope is lost  as a breeze blows in reality and  I give in as my soul cries in agony.  I accept that time is:  immortal,  uncontrollable,  a friend and foe all at once.  One that you cannot kill.

        The sweet aroma of happiness filled the air around me.     I lay on the soft, green carpet and gazed at the cloudless sky above.

        ~ I ~&nbsp; I am the  words  that mocked and cursed you  I am a  thorn  that stuck in your head  I am the  saliva  that was spat upon your body  I am a  hammer  that secured the nails in your hands and feet  I am a  nail  that caused your bloodstain  I am the  wood  of the cross where you hung  I am the  dice  that gambled your clothes away  I am the  vinegar  they thrust into your mouth  I am the  head   of   the   spear  that struck your side   ~ You ~ You are  almighty  God  You are  holy ,  merciful , and  forgiving   You are the  way , the  truth  and the  life   You are the  Lord   of   Lords   You are the  Good   Shepard   You are the  beginning  and  end   You are the  savior  of all  You are the  answer  to our prayers  You are our  Friend    ~ We ~ We are  unworthy  of your sacrifice  We are  undeserving  of your countless blessings  We are  disgusting  in your eyes  We are     judgmental   We are  mortal   We are of the  world   We are  hungry   We are      lost   We are     Sinners

       My worries disappear,  as you take my hand and pull me close. The touch of your hands, gently caressing my body; sending shivers and  butterflies that flit deep inside of me. I think of nothing but you and your kind and gentle heart  that has created a place for me in it. You bare your soul through your beautiful eyes. I look into them and I am caught in their sight. Your gaze entraps me-  I cannot turn away, for fear of them closing. There is nothing but you and I  on this earth of ours; as you stroke your hand across my face ever so gently,  brushing the hair off my face.  Leaning in closer,  I feel your breath upon my neck;  synchronized with your every heart beat. An eternity slips away as we stand there,  not moving, not speaking, just listening- enjoying the moment. Now, your breath is upon my lips as you move towards me.  I close my eyes and my pulse begins to race as I wait impatiently for the touch of your lips to be pressed against mine. I quiver at the feel of them, causing goose bumps to arise across my body. Your tenderness is shown by this kiss; which is unselfish and pure. In the midst of the sparks we created, my hands have found their place-  resting gently upon your shoulders. My fingers become tangled in your hair. They coil your locks, letting them slip through the gaps over and over again. All the while, your hands are pressed against my back- ensuring our closeness,  and reality of this moment.  A lifetime passes before our lips part. I continue to keep my eyes closed, savoring it all not wanting to suddenly wake up  and realize this was all a dream. When I do open my eyes,  my unbelieving thoughts fade away and you are all I see. I peer into your eyes once again and all I can do is smile.

       I sit alone, in the darkest of rooms. The room entombs me, secludes me. There is no escape. I am trapped, locked in here forever. The lock is monstrous, the key missing. There’s no movement, no noise- everything’s silent. I worry that I will be in this darkness forever; all alone. Feeling lonely and desperate, I try and recall the last time I wasn’t in darkness;  when I felt anything other than sorrow. My thoughts are screams in a noise-proof room. No one can hear them. I truly am alone. I feel as if there is no use-  I give up. Nobody is out there, my sun has set and eternal darkness has risen. Then from out of nowhere,  something unexpected happened. The sorrow I feel has disappeared  the darkness, lifted. The imprisoning walls have tumbled, been smashed into nothingness.   My sun rose,  and I am surrounded by light again. As I rise to my feet, I begin to shut my eyes- for the light is overpowering. I resist the urge though; I had lived in darkness long enough. I open my eyes wide and all I can see is you standing in front of me; your arms spread out wide,  beckoning me toward you. I run and jump in your arms; all my sadness and doubt is gone. You have rescued me from my prison; sheltered me from the darkness. The chains that bound me here have been broken. I am free. My worries escape me, as a soul escapes a dead body. The burden is gone,  leaving me with nothing but faith- faith in you, and in life. I feel lighter. All this heavy weight has left my body. I am carried out of the ruins, and my one and only thought I think is "I am alone no more."
