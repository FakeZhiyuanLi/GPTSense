      This was one of those years where I truly felt that the presidency did not matter. I did not really care for  the ideological thinking of Bush and Kerry, I'll get to that. The more and more that I watch the DNC the more enraged  I become enraged and determined not to vote for Kerry. Is this because I hate Kerry? Not at all, in fact I think his heart means well but I feel that about Bush. The difference is the heart of the president is strong and unwaening while that off Kerry is open to every demographic (Vote for the War, Bush is a liar, Life begins at conception but abortion is not murder). I guess it depends on the day you catch him speaking to potential voters.  	Currently the polls are even. I believe yesterday George W. Bush was up by 1%. This is scary folks! Seriously seriously scary.   The other day I was asked what the difference is between the democratic and republican parties. I responded with a few, yet selected quotes...  Republican Comedian Dennis Miller- I think of the two as checkers and chess. Kerry is a chess man, he is smart, likes to plan his moves slowly then take action, only to find out you may have made the wrong move and cannot take it back. Bush is a checkers guy, he views the threat and  jumps the bastard before they have the chance!  Democrat Comedian Whoopi Goldberg- Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia the closest thing I found to an actual quote is: "...an unsubtle anatomical double-entendre enjoining voters to 'keep Bush where it belongs and not in the White House.'"  Republican VP Dick Chaney-"Go Fuck Yourself" Democrat Senator Kennedy-"The only fear we have is four more years of this administration."  I'll throw in another  Democrat Jesse Jackson-"In the dark, a president chooses tax cuts for millionaires, but job cuts for steelworkers, firefighters and police. The president talks of homeland security, but wants to let AK-47s and Uzis back on the street. Hope comes in the morning for those Appalachia, where coal miners are dying every six hours from black lung disease. Hold on, hope cometh in the morning for our children who were sent to war in Iraq on bad intelligence and worse leadership. Sent to fight a war that's foreign to our values, that leaves us weaker and less secure, sent to a war in Iraq -- the wars of mass deception are more apparent than weapons of mass destruction. It is a moral disgrace, a moral disgrace. America deserves better."  OK Miller Vs. Goldberg: Intelligent commentary that actually complimented the candidate while supporting the President OR Vulagrity that borders on humiliation. Chaney: Did he say the right thing...yup! He was speaking to a man who talks shit about him behind his back and then tries to kiss his ass face to face. The man   deserved it. Was it right on the senate floor? No! All in all though I think it was better than a blow job in the oval office. Kennedy: Hate Rhetoric, what could one expect from someone who should have been put in jail for murder years ago. Jackson: Well we know Jackson. Point by point:   * Tax Cuts: We all got a tax cut. This free ride for the poor shit is over. Everyone had an across the board cut = more tax returns (not cuts) for those making more     money. Those who work at a minimum wage job becuase they could not get into college do not deserve anything special.   * Cut jobs for steelworkers: How? Many have been employeed to redevelop Iraq. How many were hired to help with the demolition of the WTC? Could it quite possibly be that     the Unions are to blame for this? Labor unions are notorious assholes. Not only do they employee many arrogant people, but they over severly overpaid and over compensated.     I would not hire any organized labor union.   * Coal Miners Dying:Umm, most of these people are unionized too...lol. How can you stop black lung in a career that basically supports the disease. Unfortunately this is industry in this     country. If we got rid of the industry would Jackson bitch about those laid off?   * ...morning for our children who were sent to war in Iraq on bad intelligence and worse leadership": Ok I love this one! First off the intelligence came from George Tennant, FORMER CLINTON     CIA agent not the presdient. Intelligence also came from many of our foreign leaders from Russia and Britian. Kerry voted for this war. If Kerry voted and did not review the intelligence then he should be repremanded.      If the intelligence were wrong it was their fault not the presidents'. Beyond pointing     fingers though, we need to look at this at a broader scope. Ok no back to pointing fingers. There are recorded tapes where Clinton stated Sudan offered him Osama Bin Laden and he rejected the     offer...this is fact! OK back to the war...the poor children (many of which he notes are black further in his speech (or was that Sharpton)). They are given a job, they acted upon false intelligence but in return      outsted a dictator who murdered hundreds of thousands of people, disobeyed every UN resolution and invaded other countries. They did their job and ousted Suddam. It is unfortunate that many of our soldiers died (greater than     1000, which by the way were almost weekly casulties in Vietnam) but Mr. Jackson you fail to say that many of those poor children went into the military thinking peace and hoping for a free education. You think that the minority     of soldiers are there to defend this country? Nope. They went in for a free education not suspecting 9/11. I have sympathy for the parents but not the children. Many of the minorities that entered the war went for a handout and     ended up actually working. Shame.   * moral disgrace: I think the only moral disgrace of this country would be a president who cannot make a decision and stick with it. At least the Democrats could have nominated     Howard Dean...he had morals and convictions. More on Mr. Kerry later.     Tonight...Why Kerry should be charged with war crimes!     -ttyl

              If I should die this very moment I wouldn't fear for I've never known completeness like being here wrapped in the warmth of you loving every breath of you still my heart this moment oh it might burst  could we stay right here till the end of time until the earth stops turning wanna love you until the seas run dry I've found the one I've waited for  all this time I've loved you and never known your face all this time I've missed you and searched this human race here is true peace here my heart knows calm safe in your soul bathed in your sighs wanna stay right here till the end of time till the earth stops turning gonna love you until the seas run dry I've found the one I've waited for  the one I've waited for  all I've known all I've done all I've felt was leading to this all I've known all I've done all I've felt was leading to this  wanna stay right here till the end of time till the earth stops turning gonna love you till the seas run dry I've found the one I've waited for  the one I've waited for the one I've waited for  wanna stay right here till the end of time 'till the earth stops turning gonna love you till the seas run dry I've found the one I've waited for  the one I've waited for the one I've waited for                                            This title of this unique sounding song is Gorecki by Lamb. I first heard it a few years back listening to Robert Miles "In the Mix". I recently discovered that it was part of the movie soundtrack for Les Amants Criminels as well. This François Ozon movie is a French modern day retelling of the classic Hansel and Grettel. Until recently I was unable to make some connection between the movie and the tale but now all has been revealed.    Now I want to talk about the song but let me give you a plot rundown (spoilers). The story starts off with two "lovers", Alice and Luc. We learn very early on that this is no ordinary relationship as Alice is very manipulative and Luc is very shy (sexually). Alice takes full advantage of this weakness.   Alice begins to tell Luc about a boy at school Saïd who wants to have sex with her at school after a wrestling match. Saïd is very excited to actually get  invited  by Alice to have this encounter as it was not his idea. Luc, loving Alice gets jealous of Saïd and after being told of his desire to pursue Alice, goes with her to the gym to kill him before they have sex. Out of love he kills Saïd, a guy that Alice simply does not like.   Alice and Luc flee, all begins happy. They clean up and take the body for disposal and end up in the woods after the car breaks down.   While they are in the woods they discover the house of a hermit, L'homme de forêt. The two notice he has left to hunt so they run in to get food. During the theft they are caught as he returns. Both are captured and locked in a cellar.   L'homme de forêt takes a liking to the boy and agrees to feed him meet,basically in return for bathing and sexual favors. On the side little does he know that the "fattening" with the meat is so that in the end L'homme de forêt can eat him. Another little side note is that the meat is of Saïd...caught your interest?   The predicament leads to eventual escape, death, and love.   So how does this tie into the song? Eventually Luc discovers that Alice lied to him about Saïd. His feelings were so strong that he killed to prove his love. He knew that sexually he could not give her what she wanted or needed.   Now re-read the song...how many time can you say " could we stay right here till the end of time until the earth stops turning wanna love you until the seas run dry I've found the one I've waited for"  As people we have this desire to love and be loved. In many cases we will do what we can to prove that to our companion. Luc did just that. He loved her and it could be said that in return she loved him back. Having Luc murder Saïd could have been Alice's way of making Luc feel strong, like the lover he could not be.  In the end Luc witnesses and participates in the murder of innocent Saïd, the death of another, and finally the start of a true love that he cannot have.  Fairy tales can be closer to real life than many think and sometimes it takes modern interpretations of stories before we can realize that we may be doing similar things. It takes a "What the Fuck" before we step back and realize that sacrificing is fine but putting yourself in jeopardy to prove love is stupid and in the end a waste of energy.

      "... time is not a remedy time is just an enemy we´re aimless and anemic everyday time is not receivable time is unbelievable time´s about to steal it all away time is just invincible time´s a fucking principle a dazer and eraser from behind oh this is no philosophy this is curiosity this is just the symphony of time!..." Slut  Ok this is how my day started. I woke up 50 minutes late forcing me to rush to get ready for work. I was unable to walk in the AM to work from the train because I would then be behind in time. Of course this happens when it is 65 degrees and a beautiful day for a walk! I get here (on time) and things keep going down hill.  I cannot understand my boss. I bust my ass to keep up with my job and provide the best in customer support, so why can he be such a dick sometimes? There is no need to pop attitude with me!   I guess that is one thing many will never understand about me...if you pop attitude you piss me off. If you act respectful I'll do whatever is necessary to get the job done.  I am recovering from my disasterous night with very little sleep (highlights were the ne Dead Like Me and Arrested Development). My head still feels groggy and I think in some sense it could have something to do with removing myself from Zoloft. I hope that this feeling eventually stops.   Well...back to work. I am going to pop on the headphones and zone out.

      I have decided that I am going to try to write into this Blog three times a day during the week and hopefully once a day during the weekends. Each day I will include a quote,  a poem, something that has hit me.   Today I include this unpublished poem by Denton Welch        Understanding and Fighting      My friend and I      Are close abd blind and warm,     ---Sometimes.     And then we find     All happiness in being still     And know the dark Earth.         But other times     Our hearts are far apart.     No darkness sings,     No stars keep guard;     Only the cruel words are said     And ancient wounds remembered.        * Denton Welch  Denton was an interesting character. He wrote three novels, all of which where autobiographical.   He died at 33 from injuries he recieved when riding a bike almost 20 years earlier.

      I was away for a while But I'm hoping someday you'll forgive me But I don't deserve it  I'll cherish it well if you give me One of your new starts Just one more last chance I swear that I'll earn it If you front me for now  I'm good for it I swear I'm better now I swear  In earlier days They'd persecute people They'd carry them off And hobble their legs For lesser offences Than how I have harmed you But still you allow me To walk free of pain Though I punish myself I will never settle The debts I've incurred For scorning the face Of absolute beauty And measureless grace And though I once mocked you I'm dying to pay for it now. I'm dying to pay for it now.  So hand me the rocks To help weigh me down And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound to the End of an anchor Thrown in to the sound And test me to see If I Will rise Against The worst That it  Can get.  I wasn't well for a while I savor the things that I knew Were sure to destroy me And that seemed to hold me That seemed to carry me where I couldn't go On the strength of my own But I should've known That that gets me nowhere I've learned that now I swear  I earlier days They'd persecute people They'd carry them off And hobble their legs For lesser offences Than how I have harmed you But still you allow me To walk free of pain Though I punish myself I will never settle The debts I've incurred For scorning the face Of absolute beauty And measureless grace And though I once mocked you I'm dying to pay for it now. I'm dying to pay for it now Now Now  So hand me the rocks To help weigh me down And tether my legs with a cord tightly bound To the end of an anchor Thrown in to the sound And test me to see If I Will rise Against The worst That it Can get.  Well I wasn't sure that I could Well I wasn't sure that I could Well I wasn't sure that I could But I can.
