      Here is the blog I promised earlier!  So, today has mainly consisted of working to finish off the cover of Soul To Squeeze that me and my bro started doing about a week ago. I am so glad it is finally done! The downside of doing a cover of a song is by the time you've learnt all the parts to it, you never want to hear it again.  Also today I have working on updates for my t-shirt website, as I will be soon buying the equipment to print them myself instead of contracting an external company to do it - which means more profit for me! Luckily for me, I can afford this equipment because my ICT teacher at school, and his best mate Paul are investing Â£250 each into my website!  Whilst I was working on the site, by coincedence, Paul rang me today to confirm we are meeting up next Thursday (which is also the day my AS Results come out!) to set up a joint business bank account so I can order the equipment! I'll post a blog then to say how it goes.  So anyway that's it for today - 8 days until my results come out!

      As you may have noticed - I have gone two days without posting!!! This is due to two factors: I forgot on Monday (whoops), and yesterday, it was a combination between the weather being so crap with thunderstorms that I thought my PC might get fried if I had it turned on during the storm, and the fact I spent most of yesterday afternoon recording my cover of Soul To Squeeze with my bro.  Will post later with what happened today - if you see what i mean.

      Today I have been working on a cover of "Leader of Men" by Nickelback. This is a wicked song, so I decided to start recording it on my PC using some freeware called Kristal that my mate Sean recommended. I have also started doing a cover of "Soul to Squeeze" by the Red Hot Chilis with Jon my brother doing all the bass guitar for it.  Also today, I did a bit more of my ICT summer homework - But not too much more! I plan to finish it next week. Also next week, me and my mum are going through all the university prospectuses I have collected to narrow down my choices seeing as I will have to complete my UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service for anyone outside of the UK) application form this autumn when I go back to start my final year.  Finally for today's blog; I read an article this morning on how a new search engine start-up company called blinkx could end up being better than Google! I decided I had to go on their site  urlLink www.blinkx.com  to check it out for myself. The results are amazing, all you do is download their software, and it brings up results normally when you search for stuff, but it also searchs your hard drive to bring up relevant information you've already saved on there! This is ideal for if you're writing an essay for school, as it will automatically search the web and your hard disk in the background and bring up all relevant information, including previous school work on the subject of your essay. I definately recommend Blinkx!  Anyway, cya tomorrow!

      Another hot day in my part of the world! Virtually the same weather as yesterday, and I'm not complaining.  I actually bothered to do some of my homework set for over the holidays today, I am spacing it out so I don't get to bored with doing it all in one go; after all, holidays are for resting. Talking of which; today is my last of two consectutive Saturdays off work, so next Saturday, I am back to my normal 9-6pm shift at Sainsbury's!  Also today, me and my brother (I haven't mentioned him yet have I? He's 14) went to Mike and Josh's house (Mike's my mate) but only Josh was in (he's my brother's mate). So anyway, Josh is a wicked guitarist (although he mainly plays bass, which my brother does too.) so we all had a bit of a jam this afternoon.  That's about it for today, I'll post another blog tommorow!  P.S. I doubt it will stay nice weather for long - The forecast is another large thunderstorm even WORSE (If that is posibble??!!) than the previous one within 48hrs.

      Today has been the hottest day so far this summer in my opinion! At least it wasn't humid like the last week or so. To be honest, when i woke up, i was surprised to see the sun shining, as yesterday evening, there was a sudden, monsoon like thunderstorm (which was highly irrating, as my mum made me shut down my PC 'cos she thought the lightning would fry it!).  Anyway, so, today we all went out for the day. It was pretty good, I enjoyed getting out the house. When we came back, I continued working on the song i mentioned yesterday, only to find part of it was similar to "Leader of Men" by Nickelback which i listened to yesterday for the first time, so subconsiously, I seemed to have worked out the guitar part for that, and changed it slightly. Never mind, my song kicks ass anyway!  Anyway, so that's what's gone on today. See you tommorrow!

      I just remembered today that I have to re-new my hosting for shirt-happens.co.uk by the 10th, cos that's when it expires! So I have just emailled the hosting company asking what I have to do to pay them for another year's hosting. I almost shat myself cos i thought it was overdue!  Anyway, moving on. Today has been pretty non-eventful. I have been playing some guitar, trying to get back into the habit of playing daily, which i normally do during term time, as i find it relaxing when I get home from school. Lately, I have been going through a bit of an acoustic phase with my electric guitar playing, whereas I normally play rock type music. Today I have stumbled upon the beginnings of what could be a pretty decent acoustic song, so i am going to work on that.  Also, I have started sorting out my room, there's loads of crap that I just don't want/need anymore in here, and I can tell you that alot of it that isn't rubbish is going on ebay!  Anyway, post again tommorrow!

      Just a little note to say that I have added a links section in the sidebar on the right -->. I will get round to adding more links as they come to me, but so far that'll do. By the way, I own the website  urlLink shirt-happens.co.uk !

      Hi there,  So this is my first post of my new blog. As you can see, I decided to give it a bit of an autobiography feel by calling it "My Life, a blog by Daniel Browne". A bit corny, I know.  Anyway, so a quick crashcourse for you all into what's going on in my life at the mo, so you are up to speed with what i'm going on about:  I am 17, and currently doing my A Levels (Maths, Physics, ICT and Product Design). This combination of subjects is not as daunting as it looks (for some mad reason, I have elected to carry on all 4 subjects next year), although, time will tell. Also,  My AS results come out on August 19th.     So, moving on. This summer holiday, I have got next to no coursework to do, so I have mainly been chilling out. The main events of this holiday so far consist of buying an iPod for myself, and seeing mates (I definately recommend an iPod to anyone whos' thinking about it!). My main targets this holiday consist of doing as little work as possible, as next year at school is gonna be one long slog.  Finally, in this first post, when i am not upto my eyeballs in schoolwork, I spend most of my free time listening to music, and playing my electric guitar (A Squier Bullet Strat in navy blue). I got it in October 2002, and since then I have gotten pretty good at it (It helps that I played the violin for 8 years before learning guitar). I like to write songs in my spare time, although unfortunately, I'm not good at singing, so I tend to concentrate on the tune first (rythym, lead, solos etc) and then write the lyrics.  Anyway, I've rambled enough for today. Talk tommorow!
