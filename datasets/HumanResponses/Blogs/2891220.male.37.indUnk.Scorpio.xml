      Today started in much the same way as any other, a coffee and a croissant while desparately trying to wake up and get into the day.  I was vegging in front of the TV being subjected to some horrible breakfast show when a rather disturbing piece came on about 2 lions held in captivity and terribly mistreated by their Romanian owners.  The gist of it was one of the beasts had spent his entire adult life locked in a cage 8ft x 6ft and was going slowly mad while the other had been so devoid of calcium that she was no longer able to stand properly and had all sorts of medical problems.  Very few things in life genuinely move me like this piece did and the appeal was to raise money to transport these poor animals back to Africa where it was hoped the quality of the remainder of their lives could be improved dramatically.  During the course of the program the producers were innundated with offers and it is now hoped that within the next 5 weeks the process to relocate the lions will start.  I cannot understand how anyone can mistreat such a majestic animal, maybe it's true, we English are a nation of animal lovers but even so it must be clear to even the most hard-hearted individual that to incarcerate these lions in such a way is barbaric.  Rant over...on with the day !!!

       I've become inceasingly interested in the whole subject of online diaries recently. More and more people I know are keeping them. Most are fascinating and visited daily, others not quite so but still worth a read. I decided I would take a stab at it, I lead a full and varied life so why not ?      I can't promise earth shattering revelations, probably just a stream of consciousness made up of the current events and my own opinions but hey, we've all got to start somewhere.      This weeks a little different for me as I have to go away from home due to work. This is something I do regularly but the trip I am about to undertake is the longest yet. Lately I find it increasingly difficult to be away from home for such long periods and by this I mean weeks at a time. Maybe I'm getting older but I see it as important time lost, time that should be spent doing things to enrich mine and my wife's lives. Work seems more trivial to me these days and the frequent trips away only serve to increase that feeling.      I suppose I am fortunate though as I do get to see some wonderful places and during the course of this upcoming trip I hope to post from some of these locations, including pictures and perhaps give a more balanced view of the world I inhabit.      Until later blog chums...
