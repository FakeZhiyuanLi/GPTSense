      What a past few days these have been.  The thing is, I haven't really done that much, yet at the same time feel fulfilled and quite content.  I've gotten heaps of rest, caught up the laundry, and have been contemplating future photo/art projects.  I want to do something with HUGE pieces of canvas and my photos--we'll just have to see, eh?  My personal jury is still out on this one, but big plans to put into action very soon, and I'm extremely inspired by it.    I'm planning a trip in July to Atlantic City to see Jim, a friend of mine who is a 20+ yr AIDS survivor!  It's quite a relief that I'm actually going, as I've been procrastinating this trip for 2 years.  Being in action on this one has proven to be a challenge. The reason?  I lost a dear dear friend to AIDS in 1999 (Grady), and I was completely devastated.  I guess I just didn't want to have that type of relationship with anyone with AIDS anymore.  Sounds selfish, but it's true.  As a matter of fact, I had fallen out of contact with Jim over the last year because I did find myself loving who he was as a person. He reminded me of Grady, and our relationship was becoming too close for comfort. I pulled out straight away, without any remorse or any communication with Jim.  I've grown over the last year.  I know it's ok to love someone for everything they are, and everything they aren't, and that communication is *key* in all matters.  I'm off for now, only working eight hours tonight, and I'm making it known to the world that I will be starting my 'project' tomorrow, AND will post a blog or two about it once the gears are in motion.  Oh, saw a piece on the late architect Samuel Mockbee this morning.  Amazing thing he started with Auburn University called The Rural Project.  Brilliant design these students have come up with in a small, underprivileged town, benefitting all residents, and adding the most beautiful architectural pieces I've seen in a while to this small town.

      warning: mention of puke in this post!  amazing the way people you don't even know can wiggle their way into your life, eh?  the first patient i had contact with at work last night(cancer patient) had just thrown up all over herself and the floor. a tiny little thing, with short hair like mine, only white silver in colour..... what got to me was the fact that she was in no way concerned about being covered in puke, or the floor being such a mess.  while i was cleaning her up, changing her linens, throwing towels on the floor, she asked me out of the blue if i was irish and i told her yes, part irish. she then went into this long narrative about her hungarian background, her thoughts on american culture and such things as that. she was extremely articulate throughout the discussion, but kept going off in tangents, (she needed someone to talk to) and told me she really liked my hair...she said 'you must be into art', to which i replied, yes, all types and passionate about it as well.  she was reluctant to change out of her messy gown, but willingly gave in when i started to undress her....we then had a discussion about her late husband, who was a painter..she didn't say much about him, though, and became very sleepy. i gave her another warm blanket, and she went back to sleep.  i went back to check on her, and she had this huge smile on her face, and accepted me warmly into her room, like we were totally related in every way, shape and form.  when her room was ready upstairs, i was too busy with anotherh patient to take her up, but wished her the best, and she thanked me for looking after her.    we were slammed the rest of the evening/morning, due to the fact that the 'inn was full', we had to keep some patients downstairs until the morning and other patients from upstairs were discharged.  had a good time, however--i adore working with others who can focus on being a team when things are busy rather than going separate ways wondering why others 'arent' doing their job'.  excellent ER i work in!  otherwise, i slept all day today, kept my integrity with myself regarding return phone calls i had to make...YAY!  i'm getting used to working nights, and i'm about to switch from 7pm-7am to 3pm-3am..might be even better, who knows?    got some sad news yesterday.  my friend leslie from landmark education is not going to be on staff there as of june 1st.  this has hit me hard, as landmark has had a huge impact on my life over the last two years, and a lot of it has to do with her.  seeing her smile is one of the things that gets me into the center.  if you're on it about anything or are in upset over something, she'll get ya out---AND QUICK!  bah...she's got bigger and better things up her sleeve, and will no longer be held down/held back by such a hectic working schedule that being on staff at landmark requires, so a great big YIPEEEEEE!  for her, i love you leslie!  she's got a degree in art therapy, but wants to get her MSW, so she's stepping out there big time, and i know she'll be sooooo thrilled with what tomorrow brings!  ok, i'm doing a four hour shift tonight, gotta get outta here.  more tomorrow.    xxx mezzok.
