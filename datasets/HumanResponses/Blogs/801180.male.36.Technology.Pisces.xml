      I can never remember to get my blogs in on time, I keep forgetting about doing it!  I really want to be doing this on a daily basis, but life can be too frenetic at times!  Yesterday I spent most of the morning adding a main switch into the electrics so that I don't have to keep pulling the fuse to work on the new consumer unit.  The house needs so much electrical work doing on it, I thought it best to try and make the task as safe as possible in future.  Problem is, all the wires you aren't legally allowed to change, were too short!  Never mind got round it in the end!  Spent most of the day in the garden, trimming the tree, continuing the never ending shed base foundations, taking up the old garden path, all whilst watching the kids!  Evern got time to wash the car.  What a difference a bit of sunshine makes!  Temperature must be about 13 degrees, which in the scheme of things is really quite warm, giving that it has been frosty for the last few weeks.  Anyway I have just kind of realised that blogging, potentially is a flawed medium - by this I mean that if I have a different take on a situation, whether it be world news or my mates barbeque - then if I pour out my thoughts in a blog and others don't like it, then it can cause problems.  So blogs are never going to be out pouring of the heart, unless you are very secure in the knowledge that you are not going to annoy someone close to you.

      Busy week - so not really had time to blog - the war is still going on, but it has just become part of everyday life as these things tend to do, unfortunately.

      Ok I'm bored of the war now - doesn't mean I won't pass occasional comment, but I think we are just getting information overload now - perhaps too much information, and definately not all accurate!  Today I'm back in the office, having been to Birmingham yesterday, oh the joys of being on the road - I'm probably back to Birmingham tomorrow!  Started working on my car last night only to find that nearly every bolt I wanted to undo was seized, so today I've made a management decision - I'm going to pay someone else to do it all!  Can't afford it but hey thats never stopped me before.  Also found out today that my boys adenoid operation has been delayed - whats the point of going private if the operation still gets delayed?!

      Ah, the end of the weekend! Seems to go in no time!  Well this weekend never really took off, because Jo was ill on Friday night so we had to stay in rather than go out as planned for my birthday.  Fortunately she was feeling better on Saturday, so as the weather was good, a weekend of jobs in the garden was started.  Unfortunately along the way I managed to reverse into a neighbours friends car - not much damage was done to their car, just a crease in the front wing, and no damage to the Freelander - cos its tough like that!  It still means that an insurance claim is likely to be made though, which is a pain in the proverbial, as the insurance is just about due for renewal - sods law!  Well we managed to get quite a few jobs done, made a new concrete path at the front of the house, and nearly filled the hole created by me taking up the patio the other week.    Even better this afternoon we went to a nice pub, that was also child friendly -  urlLink Half Moon, Windlesham .

      Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday dear Gary, happy birthday to me!  You'll never guess what today is!  Well I did have to drive to Nottingham again, for a meeting - but the good news was that I was back for the afternoon, in time for a few bevvies after work.  Which was just as well as it looks like I'm going to can all the other entertainment, as it doesn't look like Jo is feeling too well.

      So up to Nottingham today to demonstrate the new kit, seemed to go well, however because of a misunderstanding with one of my sales guys, I basically have to do the same damn trip tomorrow - grrrr!  This bothers me more than normal cos its my 35th birthday tomorrow, and I just wanted an easy day in the office!  I've had a number of particularly crap weeks, so I just want a little slack cut - but that just ain't gonna happen....  Oh well, Jo is out with her friends tonight, so its a number of bottles of old speckled hen for me!  The good news is that through some watching of diet, I am now down to 15 stone - I've actually lost 2 stone since Christmas - I'm quite impressed with myself!  Will it last?  I like to think so, but I am not promising anything!!

      Busy weekend!  Saturday morning was mostly spent by Jo and I recovering from being kept awake most of the night by our 21 month old, who just wouldn't sleep, because she seems to have some kind of virus.  Then the afternoon was spent transporting earth and sand from a friends house to ours.  Our friend had overorded for some landscaping work, and we were only too happy to take it from him because of the work we are doing in the garden.  Remember last weekend I took up an old patio, well there is now a damn great hole in the garden that needs filling! The earth went in there and still hasn't filled it - looks like I'm going to have to take my Dad up on his offer to get some from him.  He's doing work on his house which is going to leave him with a glut of topsoil - handy huh!  Sunday was spent in London - it's my boys 4th birthday today, so we took him up to see his Grandad at work.  Dad is Station Officer for Kensington fire station, and retires in July, so we thought we'd take Ciaran up to look at the fire station, and the fire engines, have some lunch and then go to the natural history museum.  Highlight of the day for us all, was to be driven from the fire station to the Natural History museum in a fire engine!  That caused a few looks, seeing me, my daughter, my son, my wife, my mother and sister decamp from the engine!  There were also 4 fireman on board, in order that the engine remained operational, whilst we were out - that was a laugh!

      What an entertaining week - not!  I have done everything this week except for all of the things I wanted to do, so that was nice....  Now working on a brand new imaging terminal at work, and quite an interesting toy it is - it is certainly an impressive unit, but do people really have such a great need for taking pictures of things - time will tell I guess.  It does scan barcodes as well of course and in any orientation, and almost as quick as the laser variant - not bad!

      You can tell I spend more time in the office than doing real hard work!  Yesterday was spent finishing taking the old patio up, and to day I'm aching all over, and my hands look like I've put them through a shredder - deep joy!  Now, back to work to catch up with everything I missed whilst on the course last week - and to do revision for the exam in a few weeks - its all go go go.

      Well, haven't really blogged for a while because there has not been much to say.  The only thing that has happened in my otherwise banal life, is that my son Ciaran who is only just 4 had his tonsils and adenoids out last week - poor mite.  Been quite an awful week in that respect because we have had to dose him up with pain relief, and take his mind off it all , by putting on endless videos.  Now we have to wean him off the TV!  Rowan isn't that interested in TV, so is another kind of handful for poor old mum - I'd never want to swap the job to be a house husband!

      Well haven't kept the old blog to up to date lately, but thats partly cos nothing much is going on - well there's plenty going on, but its same old, same old!  Working in the garden, working on the house - but not jobs of any great note.  Over the next few weeks I'm going to sort out a new base for both the shed and the greenhouse, but dull blog fodder really!  The most interesting thing to happen recently was getting my mobile phone pinched at the fun-fair yesterday, but even that doesn't bother me that much, as work will replace it for me anyway....

      At last work has started on the footings for our extension - they were due to start a week ago but finally today, (at 4pm mind you!), the groundworkers showed up.  But in an hour or so of work they had the site pretty much set out for a good start tomorrow.  The weather is glorious today but you can guarantee that the weather will bomb as soon as they start digging the garden up.

      It's all very well getting excited about the groundworkers working on Saturday - ( see previous post), but they don't seem to have done any work since - thats nearly 2 weeks ago now. They keep blaming the building inspector, but I just think that they are busy on other jobs.  Not that it is a real problem, but we do want to keep a little momentum up.  To that end we had a guy round from Builder Center yesterday to help with the materials planning for the rest of the build.  I opened up an account with Build Store which should mean that all our materials are cheaper.  The Build Store account brings with it accounts for Jewsons and Builder Center, and allegedly with good discount rates attached.  So it looks like we will be plugging on with the build shortly - that is if the ground workers pull their fingers out........

      The groundworkers were here today laying the drains and preparing the ground for the sand blinding and DPM.  So I was woken up by them breaking up hardcore - really wasn't expecting them - but pleased to see them anyway.  This means that the slab will probably be laid sometime next week, so things really are moving on apace.  The weather was extraordinarily nice today - really warm and sunny, so the only sensible thing is to have a barbeque later - lovely!  Probably go over to Jo's sisters place as we haven't been there for a while.  At least it seems like the summer is starting to show it's face - what are the odds of the weather being like last year - pretty remote I should think - but I am not going to be negative, the summer has hardly had a chance to start yet!

      Well Jewsons pulled it off at the very last minute - they turned up at 3:15pm yesterday and Shaun was a hero - he stayed until 4:30 when he really needed to get away at 4, really can't do with that kind of stuff.  I was quite stressed by it all and ended up having an early night, because I felt completely knackered - Jo was working at college, and Mum looked afterthe kids until about 7:30.  So it was just a case of picking them up putting them to bed, sorting a few things out for today and then bed!!  Today it was just a case of picking up a few lintels and waiting for Pat the groundworker to come.  He is going to prepare the drains today and tomorrow, with a view to laying the pad on Tuesday - (already busy on Monday).  So I think it's a few beers to wind down tonight and then get on with tidying the mess that has been created over the last few days over the weekend - still the weather looks like it's going to be good. Hurrah!

          Well today is going  to pot - Jewsons have decided not to deliver the required engineering bricks and  I have a brickie and his mate sitting idle at the moment - and the next chance  he has to come and do the work is next week, which of course is all extra  cost.&nbsp; This means that the groundworkers can't lay the pad  either..........     &nbsp;

      Well today the trench blocks and external skin of engineering bricks to damp proof course have been started.  One of Dads mates, Shaun, is doing the work and by my inexperienced eyes he seems a quick worker.  The whole of the front and garage side of the house are complete now, and he reckons he should be able to finish tomorrow.  The fly in the ointment though is that Jewsons still haven't delivered all of the remainder of the trench blocks, nor the final pallet of engineering bricks.  Shaun has enough to be going on with, but it looks like we'll be skin of our teeth with the delivery.  Building inspectors are a curious entity though.  Ours insisted on lintels everywhere, but then was that bothered about seeing the work done today.  Just means I have to fly around getting ad-hoc materials - the joys of "self-build", well "self project manage"!!
