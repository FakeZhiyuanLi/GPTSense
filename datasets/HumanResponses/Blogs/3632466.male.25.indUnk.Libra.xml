      friday night with the a-s-s crew.  wandered out to slurrey to drive through scary neighbourhoods and quench ai's thirst.  of course the night could not have ended without a visit to "homecourt" at kensington (is that where that is?).  before arriving, some drunk vina kid cuts his thumb on a empty beer can, he ends up getting lined up the most.  i can now keep the ball at an acceptable height level on the free kicks.  saturday morning poker tournament in ditchmond.  the tourney started at noon, so i figured that would give me enough time to win it all and make it to erica's birthday dinner at skybar at 7pm.  4:45pm, guess who's the chip leader going into the final table, plenty of time to make it to dinner.  get knocked out in 6th place, two spots shy of making any money.  check the watch, 7:10pm!  ai calls, "where are you, i'm here already!!!"  gggggggggg gun-it home, shower, and i'm at skybar at 8:15pm.  little boozin', little schmoozin'.  got drunk bien's shirt-off without waking him up.     now it's time to go home.  drive ai and her car home.  drive all the way back to downtown to pick up my car.  yesterday, watched the thoccer game and some nascar action, then had an impromptu bbq at ryan&joy's place with sof and ai.  good food, good company.  no weak end.

      why do i play when i'm just gonna get lined up?  probably 'cuz i'm a sucker for competition, and i'm not one to back down from any challenge.  although i'm usually lined up more than anyone else, i live for when it isn't me up against the fence.  seeing pain and anguish in my friends' faces is priceless.  i know i could easily just punch them in the face or something, but where's the fun in that?

      i have to check the  urlLink results  every 30 minutes 'cuz i still can't believe it...  daca, i hate agreeing with you, but you're right.  just imagine what this accomplishment means to some of us that have been doing this now for sooo long!  this isn't just an achievement for all the hard work this years team has put in, this is for all the other ruckers that have paddled somewhere along the way with us.  i wish there was a way that i could thank everyone that ever paddled for ruckus without coming across as an ass that's just trying to rub it in.

      so i'm guessing a fat steak wouldn't be good for the team dinner, huh?  i was asked by kaz and ai to help think of encouraging remarks for every individual on the team, a way of thanking everyone for their own specific contributions.  i started off thinking about the members that actually contributed something and wrote uplifting remarks for them.  but then i got to indivduals that didn't really contribute anything to the team.  in fact, for some members i questioned why they were even on the team!  instead of positive remarks, i was serving straight disses.  which leads me to this... am i really that big of an asshole?  i've always considered myself to be an ass, but damn, sometimes i can be straight-up mean.  but isn't it justifiable?  i'd never be an ass to someone who didn't deserve it.  discuss.

      do you ever get the feeling that "big brother" is watching you at work?  every now and then i do, so i test it out just to make sure he isn't.  some of the tests i've pulled in the past are the  sleeping at my desk  test, or the  sleeping under my desk  test.  both proved that on those particular days, "big brother" didn't have a clue!  there's also the  go for a quick rip up to squamish  test (only when jeanne drove the m3 or the 911), or the  shopping at park royal  test.  today i'm gonna do a tried, tested and true version, the  surf-all-day  test, but to spice it up a little i'm adding the  feet on the desk  test.  my job's okay.

      ever drink so much you don't remember certain time frames?  i remember all the crown shots.  i remember telling kaz i'd find another ride home.  i remember opening the door at the burger king drive-thru.  then i remember kaz calling and waking me up to go play golf.  friday night was fun.

      what better way to spend a saturday night than a trip to night market...  &nbsp;  first of all, i'm really trying not to be racist (seriously), but why pick an area where there is no parking except tight-ass stalls and street parallel parking?&nbsp; now we all know what the dominant race at night market is, so you think the organizers could find a spot with a giant parking lot where the bad driving wouldn't really matter.&nbsp; the car circus is easily seen as soon as you get off the knight street bridge.&nbsp; although it can be hella funny at times, it does get pretty stressful being in the middle of real-life bumper cars.  &nbsp;  once you've found a parking spot (5km's away), you have to battle through a sea of people.&nbsp; as soon as we got in the market, it was like being on the shinjuku line at rush hour.&nbsp; that's right, private part touching included!&nbsp; no joke ask eugene, when we were leaving, i turned around to say something to euge and this little maybe 4yr old kid sticks his hand out as he walked passed me and touched my thing!&nbsp; it was so random!!!  &nbsp;  it never ceases to amaze me how people can just sell loads and loads of absolute crap.&nbsp; who thinks, "damn, i should buy all this crap (in asia) and make money selling it at night market!"???&nbsp; if the prices for all this shit&nbsp;are so cheap, does that mean they give this stuff away where it comes from?&nbsp; 100cd spindle for 30 bucks?&nbsp; 6 pairs of socks for 10 bucks?&nbsp; cartoon print flip-flops for 4 bucks?&nbsp; how much does this stuff actually cost?  &nbsp;  one of the&nbsp;never fail&nbsp;pluses for night market is the food section.&nbsp; where else can you get such a variety of asian "tapas" at such bargain basement prices?&nbsp; (shout out to the flips selling bbq and lumpia)  &nbsp;  but no matter how much trash i talk about the zoo that is night market, there are times when you just happen to find a "diamond in the rough."&nbsp; 2 bones for my newest toy!!!  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  this electric fly swatter is going to be useful at home and at bbq's exploding unwanted bugs, but most importantly, it'll be the provider of hours and hours of drunken fun (in the form of electrocution).&nbsp; 2AA batteries give a pretty good jolt.  &nbsp;  time to sleep. &nbsp;

      this story is about&nbsp;some b at work that pissed off mandeep and i.&nbsp; we like to "take it to the extreme" at work when it comes to cracking jokes and making fun of each other.&nbsp; anyways, this b went overboard and sent an e-mail where man-slip and i were dissing some chick, to the chick that we were making fun of.&nbsp; the girl we were making fun of was upset, but later understood that we were just joking 'cuz she really likes&nbsp;man-creet and i&nbsp;(no joke, she wants to have sex with man-dip and i, probably at the same time too!&nbsp; but that's another days post).&nbsp; so man-tid and i confronted the b about her forwarding the e-mail and told her she was&nbsp;stupid, she lashed back saying that that what we write is not her responsibility or some shit (she talks so much smack about the girl we were making fun of too, just not on e-mails like man-sleep and i).&nbsp; i had to hold man-jeet back 'cuz he wanted to slap her.&nbsp; anyways, man-preet and i decided to just avoid&nbsp;b altogether from now on.  &nbsp;  so&nbsp;man-creep and i&nbsp;haven't talked to this b in 2 months, and it's pretty tough to do considering we're basically on a team of 6 people.&nbsp; i get to work this morning and look who's sitting in man-peed's cubicle crying... crazy b.&nbsp; she starts apologizing madly and saying&nbsp;how she can't stand working here anymore without man-sleep and i even acknowledging her existence.&nbsp; she showed&nbsp;us some e-mail she printed out apologizing to the girl we were making fun of in the first place.&nbsp; we told her that it didn't have to be like this but she brought it upon herself.&nbsp; we said we'd be her friends again.&nbsp; she got up and went straight to the bathroom to wash her face or something.&nbsp; and man-jinder and i laughed so hard i almost passed out.  &nbsp;  yeah, i'm an asshole at work too.

      i was just at the quay and it's boiling in there!  if my office wasn't a refrigerator, i'd probably pass out, that's how i figure i've fallen asleep the past couple nights at home, from heat stroke.  the worst is like last night when you're sitting around (at bien&jean's), not in any direct sunlight (or any light for that matter), and you're not doing anything, ANYTHING, and you're sweating like a dog!!!  feels so gross.  i wonder if there's a pill you can take to cool your core body temperature, that would be the shit!  where can i buy that mist contraption?  i'll probably need it tonight at daca's (fuckin' sauna).  heat sucks, i wish it would snow tonight.

      there's nothing better than being able to accomplish multiple goals in a single time frame.  quinton "rampage" jackson manages to score a gazillion points, knockout ricardo arona with a dibilitating power bomb, and incurs a gash just above his right eye that easily sows up with 40 stitches.  now that's efficiency!!!     support the black man.

      i guess that could be considered a problem... if you ever rub me the wrong way, you're screwed.  some of you might know what i'm talking about, it only takes one incident and i'm never gonna forget.  i could give a few examples, but some of you might read this and not want to be my friend anymore.  ...but then again, i probably wouldn't really give a shit!

      my face has started to peel.  i figure it's just a matter of time before my chest, sholders, and back will follow suit.  i wonder how all the chafing from my golf bag tomorrow will aid in that process.  my skin feels like dry leather.

      the perfect seat for a birthday boy, an old toilet sitting in an alley.     although the long (super long) weekend ended with the need to cover my body in aloe every 2 hours, it was fun nonetheless.  playing hookie from work, poker @ lex's, golf on canada day, bbq @ pat's, playing with kyla, shopping with jeanne, lounging @ sof's, kitchening with kent, bbq @ eva's, splashdown with the triple A crewette for charlene's bday, bbq @ john's, all capped off with an alienz game of a-s-s 'til 1am.  good clean fun!!!    this, on the other hand, is straight up dirty chug styles.  (he even put the lid up!!!)

      ever spend 8 hours in the sun at splashdown without having any sunblock touch your skin?  i didn't know my skin could look as red as it currently does.  last night we were out on the deck and my legs and arms were feeling chilly, but my chest, shoulders and back were on fire!!!
