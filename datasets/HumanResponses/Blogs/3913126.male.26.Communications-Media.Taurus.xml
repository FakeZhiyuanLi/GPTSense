        Absolutism    There are no absolutes for something so relative as a human life.  -Hugh Prather, Notes to Myself  Funny how it seems true when you read it in a book. When I say, at the age of 40, I want to write a book. When I say I want to be a hair dresser for 2 years. When I say tomorrow I want to meet this person, go this place, finish this much work, wake up at this time, and wear this. So how often have things gone the way I wanted them to? And how often have the results been exactly the way I wanted them to be? And how often, when the result has been the way I wanted it to be, have I been as happy as I thought I would be?   Has it happened to you that you wore this outfit that you never imagined yourself wearing 6 months ago, just because you had nothing better to wear, and got more compliments for it than on a day you meticulously planned your dress code? What are the chances of you making more close friends in 6 months of working than you did in 4 years of graduation? Has someone else's question ever given you answers and shown you realities that were always in your face? How often have things been perfect? When you do come across things that ARE perfect, how often is it that you planned them? Have you ever been bitterly disappointed that perfection was too perfect and lacked spontaneity, and hence, wasn't perfect after all?   So is symmetry perfect? Is asymmetry not beautiful? Isn't the now more important? Aren't mistakes more important than failures? So would you really like a spate of winnings and no losses at all? Is what I dream to be tomorrow, stopping me from being me right now? Is the life I am leading what I want? Am I living or existing? Is it wrong to want to live? For that matter, is it wrong when at times, you want to give up and don't want to live? Is it wrong that you don't want to be strong? But if you are, does that mean you are superior? Does that make you a better person? So who is a good person? If a social worker, who helps unknown people improve their lives, beats up his wife, is he a good person or a bad person? Are you a good person? Are you bad? Are you never bad? Does bad mean wrong? If you are being bad in self defense, is that wrong or correct? Did God put you/us on this Earth to make a point? Does he have to? Is there a point to everything? Should there be a reason for living? If you don't achieve all that you dream of achieving and are still content, are you a loser because you didn't get what you wanted or are you a winner because you don't want no more?So are dreams really important? Am I really important? 200 years later there will be no trace of this magazine or the person who wrote it. But the ideas will persist. That makes the thought important, more like significant, than I, the creator or thinker of these thoughts.   I may get two minutes of fame in the future, when I am 40 and dying of lung cancer. Is that worth wasting my youth doing what I don't want to do then? Is doing what I don't want to do really a waste? If not, am I gaining something here?Should you gain something from everything you do? If you gain nothing, is that an experiment that went wrong? So how can an experiment, where you cannot really predict an outcome, ever go wrong?   If you gain a lot, and you think you gained from a mistake, will you repeat the mistake, even if you know making it the second time would be harmful/hurtful/stupid? But if you do gain, isn't the mistake much better than all the corrects you have done in your life?So can you really control your life? Can you say with certainty that at 9 am tomorrow you will wear a red T-shirt and eat eggs for breakfast? So what is definite? Is anything? Does definite give you a sense of security? Is security tantamount to safe? Do all these questions merit answers? Does anyone have the answers to them? Are these questions really questions or statements with a question mark at the end?Does that matter at all?  ************************************************************************************* I am a question mark reincarnate. This is my mind being me. As for the time, I wrote this after I read the book Notes to Myself by Hugh Prather, at a particularly complex and crossroad-ical juncture of my life.  ] d e e p a [

      Silence of the Crowd  It's not enough. Or is it?Flowing water. Curbed thoughts. Expression suspended. Spiraling smoke.An amulet encircling my thumb. Uncomfortably numb.I want more. Or not. Will I stop looking?This is the beginning.Or the end?No I am not stoned.Blinking cell. Blue and white.Disgusting noise. Eclectic psycho-babble.Long hair. Unfinished looks. Bald man; doesn't smoke.Spiraling smoke.Crystal ashtray. Pen moving. Thoughts astray. Crumpled tissue..Non blank cheque, enclosed inside. Uncashed yet.Trying to hide or reveal.Noisy water. Crowded train. Beaded nose ring.Not too bored. No motion, of thoughts or feet, or things, living or unmanifest, just water.Silence in words. Words of silence. So who defines natural? Conservative courts? Closed minds?Filthy, rotten books, wormed into by aging decay.I don't want to be Jesus. I don't want to be an angel.I don't want to be anything.  Being John Malkovich. I don't want to be him.  ********************************************************************************** I wrote it partly on a crumpled tissue paper and partly on the backside of an ICICI credit card bill envelope. I put down the first thing that came to mind when i saw&nbsp;OR felt anything.   ] d e e p a [

       The Birthday Speech  I don’t know why Shona has asked me to speak at her birthday. I’m not good at these things. Don’t like giving birthday speeches. I’m afraid that I’ll come out to be too critical or my jokes will fall flat. I’ve known Shona for such a long time, and there are times I feel that I don’t know her at all.   Shona likes her space. I’ve never known anyone who likes quiet time so much. She likes her quiet in the morning just when she gets up. She reads a lot. She likes interesting people. She has her mood swings. Does one talk about such things at a birthday party? Remember, I will be competing with the wine for attention.   Shona’s friends are a mixed bag. There are those that have 9-5 jobs in financial corporations. I met another group some time ago. They were second generation Asians discussing the body as a space for cultural identity. I know that Shona’s interested in culture. She did a degree in it. She grew up in three different countries. I don’t know what she calls home. She says that she’s a cultural anomaly. She smiles when she says this. Must be hard not fitting in. Making friends knowing you will have to let them go in a few years. Having to explain your life over and over again to people who nod their heads but don’t quite understand.  I don’t understand these discussions on space and identity. For me space is full of stars and planets. I know that Shona wanted to be an astronaut when she was small. She was one of those chubby Indian kids in England. Her mum used to dress her up in frilly dresses with white knee high socks. If you ask her now, she will tell you that the 1980s was the era of bad fashion. A well-meaning family friend told Shona that she was too fat to be an astronaut when she was 7. Shona lost interest in space after that. Exercise is something Shona caught on to since she started university. Now, she’s in India and her relatives tell her that she’s too thin (and too dark) to bag a husband.   Life is full of contradictions. I never thought that Shona would end up in India. I know that she was scared when her parents decided to move to Kolkata into the arms of a conservative family. She moved with them. A concrete jungle for a girl who grew up in a small English town, a tiny rain forested equatorial country, and ended up in the leafy suburbs of Sydney. She misses her green space. She misses her independence. Her snot has turned black because of the pollution. She has also grown up.   There are a lot of things about Shona I could say. I don’t know how appropriate they would be for a birthday. I know that she wishes her clever/quirky younger sister or that her best friend/boyfriend were here. Neither of them will be. One remains in London and the other in Sydney. Maybe that’s why Shona asked me to give a speech. I sit here racking my brains. I’ve never written a birthday speech before. What does one say?&nbsp; &nbsp;  ~shona~

      Thirst - AIC  "I'm thirsty. Can I have something to drink?' he said.  'Hmmm. Come on in.'  A minute ago, I had been sitting in my rocking chair listening to Bob Dylan, when I heard the doorbell ring.  I pointed him towards the sofa and made my way into the kitchen. Should I give him water or should I offer him something else? Tea, nimbu pani, litchi juice, tang..? After all, there are different kinds of thirst.   I turned back towards the living room.  'What would you like to..'  He was rifling through the top drawer. He swung around.  We looked at each other for a moment before he pulled out a switchblade. Click.   'What do you..'  I sat down into the rocking chair, watching my blood gush out of my neck.  Yes. there are different kinds of thirst.  ~j~

      Frame of mind - AIC  The frame of a train window, a train stalled at a lonely point. A farmer, alone with his ox, tilling the cracked land- a series of electricity grids- the lone signs of evolution, the sky downcast , the air still , the land quiet, streaked by the screeches of two crows.   The bars of the window cast a painful doubt-is this man trapped in a life, with no hope, no future, no happiness, a life of strife and struggle, against the land, the landlords, his will?  The sweat drips off his brow as he stops and scans the horizon. I follow his gaze. In the distance, a woman sprints her way over bunds and bushes, a cloth package in her hand. Soon she is with him and he opens the package, while the woman wipes the sweat of her brow with the sari. The man sits down and begins to eat the food and talks to the woman.   I move towards the door for a better view.  The man smiles at the woman and the train whistle blows and the train begins to move.  ~j~

      the story of the emaciateddy. - AIC  Long long ago in bethlehem, the holy book says so, there was once a head so bright, could only be brought by the bald head shine, then all the other reindeers, used to laugh and call him names. and then there was the reindeer fodder scam and rudolph was banished to earth. And one lovely monsoon day, I told rudolph, will you ride my sleigh today. And then he rode the auto with the headlight on. And with this story, he will go into history. ~j~ notes: based on an thin auto guy who was almost bald and had his headlight on at 9 am today.

      THE MAN wrote this. I hope this makes your day.  'Thou hast made me endless, such is thy pleasure. This frail vessel thou emptiest again and again, and fillest it ever with fresh life.  This little flute of a reed thou hast carried over hills and dales, and hast breathed through it melodies eternally new.  At the immortal touch of thy hands my little heart loses its limits in joy and gives birth to utterance ineffable.  Thy infinite gifts come to me only on these very small hands of mine. Ages pass, and still thou pourest, and still there is room to fill.'  -RT

      Just a vague line of thought: Stars:Suns::Entertainers:Businessmen  Stars are like these pretty, good to look at things- cheer people up, entrall people and all that, but no real necessity value as as such.  So also are entertainers.  For example: a filmmaker cannot trade films for wheat in a barter system.  Now the suns (ok now please dont start with the 'the sun is also a star' theory) are like these sources of energy, providing light and sustenance to life, generating more activity in other things. So are businessmen.For example: A business starts a business and provides livelihood for like hazaar people.  Now so would u want to have stars in ur eyes or a sun in ur eyes?

      why does my hand tremble?  Maybe its the fear that one day someday someplace sometime somehow, ok now enough, write now, right now, the sky will turn. And maybe wink and give a flying kiss. Miss me, it will whisper. For NOW is an neverending tale of hope, soap and grope. Misery will keep you miserly with yourself. So you too will turn. OH, you say. So does the rest of the world as it sits to drink its blues away. I meet the sea and the land, within your reach. The land on which you exist, trying for life to soothe you, soar you into the sky, but you hope, for a better tomorrow, a better future, a better everything,- turning your back to now, and how. Just adding to the tears in the sea. Global warming they call it-if only they knew. One day it will be an earth of tears, of unfulfilled desires, of unchased dreams - terra firma to teary karma.   Reclaim your soul, reclaim your mind, the heart pumps blood, no more, no less.  Energy will stay constant, some this now this, some that, then that. Dreams are like clouds, some fluffy, pretty, some wispy, useless, some nimbus, savour them-for they renew your life. You live, you make good, you make mistakes, you are not wrong, you are not right, these are just conventions. Let them bring structure to your life, but let them not be bounds.   You are who you are, when you are, what you are, how you are. Break your heart, break free of your heart. Read fairy tales, dont believe them, there are no fairies, ever seen one? Dont live on hope. Hope never ends.  Dreams define, life refines. Hold on to the things you believe in, but dont make them your anchors. Anchors dont let you move, they ground you. You were wrong, now make it right.  Will you turn?

      Yellow - bright, happy, cheerful. Make it yellower and it becomes white. White - blank, potential, nothing. Make it whiter and you are an advertiser of detergent soap which is blue. Blue - blue, numb, nice. Make it bluer and you go dead, bloodless which is red. Red - whoa, achtung, rusky. Make it redder and you like a woman author who wears pink. Pink - girly, healthy, rockstaress. Make it pinker.

      I brought silk flowers tonight. Also known as rhodesias/rhodesia/rhodesiums? A walk along the coast on a cool breezy night after it has just drizzled can do wonders for your spirits. They are now in a green wine bottle in water. Tomorrow i have to buy salt and put a little of it in the water.  Apparently it makes them live longer. But arent they already dead.  Salt to get the experience of watching the flowers a bit longer.  50 bucks and a pinch of salt.

      the purpose is lost in its search the objective of an explanatory end insane the paths throughout vitality crowding vision the lack of the knowledge of the ultimate feeling, a pointless exercise in attempting the seclusion of an unknown. life unclear, out of focus, truth based, nirvana ended, a wake of consciousness, the vigour of motion,  the delectable platter of options, the sourness of consequences, the futility of trying to control it, rather than assimilating the outcomes, and savouring the moments. the rush for the next one, trampelling over now

      I realized something about myself today.  Maybe it applies to everyone as well. I dont know and I dont care.  The act of giving. Amrita, a long long time ago, told me to hook up with someone.  She said I had a lot to give; whatever that meant.   I have always given freely; but been awful when it comes to receiving.  I try to be graceful about it, but it never goes down well. Maybe its some need within me to be the role of a giver.  maybe it provides fuel for my big ego.  Recent events where I gave and I received; events that brought about a thought that something wasnt right, not balanced. I could not give as wanted and expected. And i couldnt receive at the same time. Because I wasnt giving. There was no balance between the giving and the receiving.  I often committed to something due to my inability to say no. I eventually ended up not doing those things, leading to various altercations and so on.  Now thinking about it, my sense of giving is one where I give, on my own accord, at my own time. The moment something is asked from me, it loses its purity.  Something similar to my intense mental closure to orders,  especially orders that do not make sense to me. I just clam up.  when the act is original, infinite and boundaryless, I can give and give and give.   just a thought into my nature, the way i think i function.

      Santa Cruz to Malad, NH4, S.V. Road - 070320041430  As you know I am currently trying to live a simpler life. I also need a cheaper mode of transport. The auto fares are killing, and no, I do not wish to take a bus or train.  Also I dont have much money on me to buy a car or even a motorcycle. Plus I desperately need some form of exercise.  4 reasons. 4 very good reasons. So I decide to buy a bicycle- the simplest form of urban self-transport.  A bicycle- I want to ride my bicycle I want to ride my bike.  So I set forth to purchase one. Am still not sure whether to go in for those fancy 5-geared jobs (never ridden them before), a bmx type funky bicyle, or my good old Hero Ranger types (4 years of hardcore riding experience in Bombay and Vellore Roads).  A simple life. Simple transport. A bicycle.  Now those who know me well, or even somewhat, know I am hmm how do I put this- not simple? Me being me, I end up buying a Hercules Topgear- the best of its kinds in India.  Obvious by its name, its a geared bicycle. But 18 gears- 18 different fucking gears.  With two Japanese rotory handgrips that I need to turn back or forward to set the right gear setting for that particular speed, incline or slope.  And life gets complicated all over again.

      someone asked what I would do if I had all the money i wanted in life. here was my answer.  'travel the world. stay atlleast 3 months in each place. meet people. write stories and features and not care whether the mag/newspapers pay or not. commission short movies based on concepts that i like.  throw some money from Dadar overbridge and watch what happens down. maybe take this to other places in the world. get invitations from world leaders to do the same.  open and run the sound studio, club, coffee shop, publishing house, radio station, street children and old age homes, hire assasins to kill people who fuck the world. make a statue on myself and look at it from time to time and feel humbled. hire people who will make more money for me. give money to all my relatives and snigger and push them around when they are trying hard to be nice to me. clean the rivers and streams and sea shores.   make a movie about myself and pay people to go watch the movie and break all records. watch people go purple with envy and jealousy and haughty indifference and drop a 1Lak bundle with my name on it near them and watch them secretly. if they take it and push, videotape them and show it on national news. if they return it, make them part of my trustees for the trust.  invest in aids and other diseases research. buy 2-3 countries. buy a 5'5" by 2' plot for my remains. write a will with 5 unwritten names as beneficiaries. watch everyone try to be one of the 5.  tie money all along a string that runs around the world.  start my own mint and become a standard against which currencies gain or lose.'  tbc..

      the more u learn, the less u feel u know,  the more u want to learn or give up,  the more u go out into the world and into urself,  the more u begin trying to understand the meaning of it all, the more u realize the answer is within u,  the more u withdraw into urself,  the more u want to get away from the world u are trying to understand,  the more u realize that the root of all confusions is within u,  within ur perceptions,  within ur understanding,  the more u withdraw into urself,  and then u die.

      Once there was this young bright mal girl who her father named Jennifer. Because, at birth, her nose resembled a conifer. Her father married her mother. Now her mother too called her Jennifer. Because of all that she had to suffer. We also call her Jennifer. Because, now, she is a duffer (and often a bluffer).   In a distant planet, once runover by apes, now trucks runover apes, a bright exhibitionist studied how to exhibit. Its now an ex-habit. He disliked fools and liked tools and was named Atool. Due to strong eddy currents in the solar plexus, he left his coop of a house and bought a car, a coupe. It was blue. Sadly, one day when everyone had the flu and into their hankies blew, his heart chanced on something new.His heart beat his lungs and he had a thunder stroke. He saw the one, noe, not neo, but the one who was known by many names and by one name all at the same time. The name will be asked for at the end of the Ramayan.   In the same distant planet, once runover by apes, now trucks runover apes, someone had aped an ape using some tape. That someone had flat ears and was vice. He was the jedi. One day, a solar plexus flared and he became Atool's best fiend.   There was an old lady. She was a land lady. She wanted to meet her friend, a bag lady. The bag lady didnt want to the old lady who was a land lady. But she didnt know that the old lady wanted to meet her. To make things worse, the old lady didnt know that the bag lady did not want to meet her. There was no power in Eastern America. This is the story of the two ladys.  Jennifer came from the south and stood at the bus stop on Street helm. She was waiting for a bus. A bus was late. She stood at the bus stop. She continued stooding at the bus stop. Freeze frame 1.  Jedi was mad. His wallet was misplaced. He had some change in his pocket. Jedi wanted to go home. He came from the east and stood at the bus stop on Street helm. He was waiting for a bus. A bus was late. He stood at the bus stop. He continued stooding at the bus stop. He ate bananas till he was ready to split. Freeze frame 2.  The old lady wanted to meet the bag lady. She came from the west and stood at the bus stop on Street helm. She was waiting for a bus. A bus was late. She stood at the bus stop. She continued stooding at the bus stop. Freeze frame 3.  A man came in from the north. He saw Jennifer. He saw the long sexy legs. Then he saw the nose. He frowned and looked at the old lady. Freeze frame 4.   Krash, zoop, crackle (tree burning), singe (tree gets wet and has an organism. For some, this is the representation of one stormy night. For others, this is the representation of stormy night. This is known as herd mentality. What they heard from the grape vine. Too much of wine makes people talk. Some grapes, also known as kajoors, whine.   Okay, there was a storm. The man ran across the road to the bus stop on Street helm. He slipped on a banana peel. He banged into the old lady. The old lady fell. Her ankle broke. Jedi threw away the banana bag. Freeze frame 5.  Far far away, there lived a princess. The bag lady smiled for no reason. In the nearby temple, bells rang and tolled. There was no tax. The government was lax. Clinton just played his sax. Monika also played Clinton's sax.   Rapidly zoom in and zoom out frame 1 to 5. Show frame 1,3 and 5 within hearts and let the hearts rotate around the scene. Loop background music track of Mein pisal gaya from Koi Mil Gaya. Thaw frames 2 and 4.   Pan to south south east. Atool cruises into view. He glances into the frame. He flicks his cigarrette aside and parks the car to the side. He reverses and parallel parks. He goes ahead and parallel parks. He reverses and parallel parks. Now he is in parallel universes. he comes out of the car and steps towards the bus stop on Street Helm. Behind him, the petrol station explodes. He flicks his coat to a side and comes to the bus stop.   What happens next? Who will Atool take home? Will he drive into the mignight masala? Will he be the saviour of the old lady? Will he be the best fiend? Will he be Romeo naam mera, chori hain kaam mera? What? Why? Who? When? Where?  ~j~

      The old man was dead. Baba was dead. I stood there, a throbbing ache resounding in my heart. Abdul walked away, a vague smile on his face. Abdul and I hated each other, years of dislike now cemented by my changed fortunes. It didn’t matter anymore. This place didn’t matter anymore. Did anything matter anymore?  I was 8 then. 10 years ago, when the zoo had started in the locality I worked as a shoe-shine boy. To encourage more people and more money coming into the zoo, the management had made the zoo in a unique manner. The ticket counters were situated after the zoo had started. It was meant to entice the potential patrons. A pair of young elephants was caged on each side of the entrance. It was an amazing sight. Two elephants running amok in their huge cages, tearing at the bamboo trees and rolling in the little man-made pools. Once the public had passed this spectacle, the fairly high entrance fee didn’t seem much.   I had run away from my village when I was 5. My mother had run away when I was 4. My drunk of a father ensured that we were fed well with beatings and shoutings. Yes, beatings first, shoutings later. Why? I would never know. All I would know was that I was evil and my mother was a whore. Did washing vessels and clothes at people’s houses make someone a whore? I didn’t know and I didn’t care. My back burned. One day in the midst of burning tears, I just walked out and held onto the back of a bus.   The big city was dark, dirty and noisy. A week ago, I spent my evenings at the pond at the edge of my village and the forest, watching the animals drink and play around. Now I was watching others drink and play around. I was hungry, ragingly so. I watched other children beg at the red lights and others polish shoes and others work at tea shops. I tried asking for work at tea shops, but the boys already working there would shoo me away. One of them beat me up. I then mixed with the shoeshine boys. They were a weird lot. One of them, Afzal, the friendliest of the lot, used to smoke bidis and sometimes sniff a white powder. But he was the one who fed me and we shared the same pavement. One morning, I woke up to see that he was gone. That white powder smeared on his nose and he lay there, a serene smile on his face, dead. That is how I became a shoe-shine boy. I had inherited a shoe-shine box from my friend.  The zoo was super. A year ago, the area was this waste dump. I had watched the animals being taken into the zoo. Elephants, tigers, birds, rhinos, peacocks, a giraffe… Visions of my village sprang into my dreams ago. But no more nightmares, happy dreams. I slept properly after a year of nightmares. The next day I ran to the zoo. The elephants were up and trumpeting away. I oh so wished I had something to feed the elephants. I reached the entrance and saw that it was 20 rupees. I checked my pockets to find that I had 12 rupees. Dejected, I stood there, and looked back at the elephants. The smaller one stood at the edge of the cage and looked at me, its trunk swaying to and fro. And it smiled at me. Baba used to laugh when I said that to him, but it did. I ran to the fruit vendor on the road and bought 3 bananas. I sped back to the cage and threw two of them over the cage and sat across the road and watched the cage. In a few seconds, I saw the bananas being scooped up by the trunk. That’s when I first met Adbul.  tbc.. ~j~

      A friend asked a question which goes as ' Why do people fall in love?' This is the theory I came up with: 'because of gravity.  It all started when the apple fell on Newton's eye. Thence, the apple of the eye has always been associated with that someone u love. And u must have one of them, because thats how you can keep the doctor away. (Now if the apple of the eye is itself a doctor, well, u've dug your own grave. Keep away from doctors. Who knows, they might be practising on you too!) Now the doctor is important because usually without them, man can kick the bucket. According to studies, man does not like kicking buckets; it hurts, especially if your not wearing any footwear.  Your sole can save you in such a case. Similarily. your soul can save you too. Now, since sex is a human being's second basic instinct (the first being self-defense-for the unoriented and non-orientals), your soul too needs a mate.  To sum it all up, if you want to be saved, your soul needs to mate, thereby requiring a soulmate.  Hence you fall in love.'

      I finally saw it. The heavenly body rested on a shiny platform. The rays of its sun shimmered from the surface. A world rich in minerals and oil, it has been the quest of millions. I approached it in my tri-rotored space transporter. At the same time, a different life form swooped in and landed on a ridge on the body. I made a mental note of remembering to avoid that land. God only knows what other life forms have infested the globe. I got off my transporter. Now I could see the other heavenly bodies all clustered in a divine platter. I raised my index finger and pointed towards the skies. A minute later, I bit into my vada pav.

      If there is a God, good. I need to ask God some questions. If there is no God, good. I dont see life changing anyways. If I am God, I dont have any answers, esp. not for you. Faith is a parallel universe one lives in, a mental link from the known reality to the hoped for unknown. Organized religion is a deal.  Philosophy is a study of the Ideal that ends with tired opinions and compromises on the Ideal. The Ideal is an unknown. Different things for different people, something never really clear. The answers are all there. Learn to frame the questions properly. Do not ask questions unless you can handle the answers.  Nothing is constant. To ask a person 'dont ever change!' is a stupid thing to ask. everyone changes, whether they or others like it or not.  Life is crazy. And so are you, if you try to make sense of it.

      Sand and a Sunset – AIC  The waves lapped relentlessly over the rocky protrusions of the reef. I stood there, still, the zephyr swirling my curls and a mild, salty mist layering me with the smell of the ocean. The sun was on its way down; another hour and it would be gone. The sky was taking the colors of a psychedelic trip, flushed with hues of purple, blue, and orange. I took a swig at the bottle of mineral water and then let the remaining water flow into the ocean. Maybe the ocean will be less salty and my eyes would not burn as much. I smiled at my own stupid reasoning, and began hopping across the rocks. The sun slid behind a cloud, bringing a sudden darkness around me. I paused, sighed, and walked towards the shore. The recent happenings in my life were drilling a hole into my heart, a constant throbbing pain in my head. He had been pursuing me relentlessly for the last 6 months. I was now at a stage in life where companionship was getting important, but I wanted companionship that came out of love. He believed in it too, but other events in my life were buffeting me.   I often wondered whether what I felt for him was love or something else. How would I know? I knew he loves me from his mind, heart, and soul; and he was ready to wait. He was a beautiful person, but would his love last? Would it be like the beautiful sunset that went away when the sun went down? Would it just be like the way rocks are battered by time and water, and become sand? I had reached the shore; my now-bare feet leaving footprints on the wet sand. A corncob seller was selling his goods at a corner of the beach. I walked up to him and asked for one-with salt and lime. I watched the way he made the corncob and put it in a corn leaf before giving it to me. Some things in life were just beautiful. I turned around, walked to a spot under a coconut tree, and sat. I watched the sunset while relishing the corn. I wish he were here to share the sunset with me. ~j~

      Yo-Yo – AIC  A spear of hurt and pain streaked through my being. I sat down on the kerb and sobbed, my head a dead weight between my arms. Warm bitter tears wet my sweatshirt burning a path. A passerby slaps me on my back and says something cheering I guess.   Francesca’s betrayal was the last straw in the late decline of my life. All those wonderful movements we had shared together during our loving and passionate romance through our years together at college was marred by the sight of her kissing a man at the café.  Francesca had been an exchange student at my university. The moment we locked eyes, we both knew we were meant for each other. Two years of pleasant courtship finally culminated at the airport where I proposed to her before she left back for LA. The most delirious moment of my life, that expansive, eye-twinkled smile saying yes. I had rushed back home to convey the tidings to my rather orthodox parents, wondering how they would react, but hopeful that all would go well.   I remember that night like a horror flick poster. In my exigent desire to share the good news with my parents, I failed to notice the intense gloom pervading the house. My slow, barely composed speech was met without any reaction, if not for a slight drop in my parents’ countenance. I had felt it would be better in the morning, so I continued walking upstairs on cloud nine.  The next morning, I was startled from my slumber by the incessant drone of an alarm far away. I woke up to find that it was 6.15. I walked down to my parents room, to find them sound asleep. Something wasn’t right. Imagine my dad breaking decades of strict regimen of waking up at sharp 6. Confused, I shook my mother. She was cold and stiff. I spied an empty bottle of sleeping pills on the bedside table. I ran over to my father’s side and felt him. His face was frozen in a contorted frown. I rushed to the phone and called up our family doctor who later proclaimed that I was an orphan hereafter.  A strange buzz filled the air and everything begun moving slowly. I slid into settee and stared at the newspaper on the teapoy. A million questions were whirling in my head. I had killed my parents. The people who loved me most on this earth, fed me, taught me, cried with me, cried for me. And I had killed them. It was long before I focused to find my father’s photo on the front-page. I grabbed the paper and read. A horrible report about a raid being conducted at my home yesterday by the police and tax authorities, with a libel of public fraud and tax-evasion. The other accused, my father’s best friend and long-time partner was absconding.   The next few days were a hazy chain of unsavory events. I had lost my parents, our business, our reputation, everything that had ever mattered to me. My only saving grace was my beloved Francesca. Her smiling face peered at me through countless people and her cool calm hands held my hands through the ordeal. She and her sister called up frequently. One day screaming from a nightmare where I push my parents over a cliff, and I decided I had to be with Francesca. I emptied my meager bank account, and borrowed some more and booked passage for me on the next available LA flight.   My spirits rose with the airplane. Soon I would be in the arms of Francesca. I hadn’t told her I was coming. To see her face break into that smile of hers was worth anything. It was late evening when I stepped out of La Guardia airport. I picked up a bouquet of her favorite tulips and walked down to the café where she spent most of her evenings with her friends.   I reached the café and scanned through the crowd, my heart pounding through my ears. Through the fumes and the smoke of the bustling café, I saw a couple in the far corner, twinned in each others arms. I smiled, finally happy with the world. The waiter approached them and they broke up, still clinging onto each other. My balloon deflated ad my head exploded. It was Francesca in that corner. The tulips slid off and I walked away, dazed and defeated, dropping along the remaining pieces of my heart.  Here I am now, sitting at a kerb in a new land, with nothing more left to live for. Just guilt, pain, misery and loneliness. All my dreams revolved around my parents and Francesca. Now nothing. I might as well go with my parents.  I walk into a drug store and ask for the same sleeping pills my parents used as a one-way ticket. I wander aimlessly, popping in pills one after the other. A little pup cuddles into his mother’s belly. I make my dying wish to go away in the arms of Francesca. I trudge to her condo, slowly feeling the pills taking effect on my system. I approach the lobby manager and ask for Francesca. He replies that Ms. Francesca isn’t in town, though her sister was in. He confirms Elaine’s knowledge of my existence and I waddle into the elevator. What the hell was happening?   The door opens and Elaine peers out. I’m stunned. It’s the same girl at the café, who I had presumed to be Francesca. I had forgotten in my delirium that Francesca and Elaine were twins. I meekly follow her into the chamber impervious to Elaine’s condolences. Elaine explains that Francesca had left a couple of days ago to India to be with me, and reached there to find out that I had left for the U.S. SO she was returning soon.   Shame descended on me as a pack of hyenas on dead carcass. How could I? I interrupt Elaine and tell her that I needed to be admitted to a hospital immediately before falling into a stupor. I awake to find myself in a cozy hospital room with tubes sticking out of me, and Popeye punching the daylights out of Blutto on the television. Elaine smiles and tells me that I was going to be alright and that Francesca had just called from Boston airport to say that she would soon be boarding a flight back home.   Every passing moment inflates my spirit and longing to see Francesca again. I listen to Elaine noncommittally and watch the television, my mind far away with Francesca. Elaine goes to fetch breakfast and I begin to watch the morning news. Suddenly, a live feed of a burning building was shown. I recognize it as the WTC. Just as I figure out what is happening, the second plane slams into the tower.. ~j~

      Loneliness    A new moon, millions of stars twinkling above so many dead loved ones living on... the road below begins to feel cold, Get up and start walking down the long straight road. cold, black, leading onto darkness  the huge mountains coated with a murky dark hue giving a backdrop to the single tree a lone leaf hanging on to precious life  a chilly gust sweeps through the wastelands the leaf bids adieu to the living world and begins its march towards fertiliserhood  Is there any life here... A crunch beckons an ant lays crushed under my feet. it writhes and lays still  the wind ceases clouds cover the sky Spin around surveying my world Close my eyes, spread my arms out breathe, feel... ~j~

      In the beginning – AIC  The TTP – OEM – 01003 was vibrating with an ear- aching resonance as I snuggled into the anti-matter chair. My uncle was due any moment now. This was his prototype time travel portal, the one he had been secretly working on in his basement. Off late he had been upbeat and had a twinkle in his eyes, a sign that invariably meant that he had had a breakthrough. I was his sole confidant and friend a relationship balanced by my enormous patience and his need to validate his work.  I was supposed to wait for him and he was already 3 hours late and I was hungry. It was way past my lunchtime. So I began fiddling around with the knobs which reminded me of salami. I was breaking a cardinal rule with my uncle. NEVER EVER TOUCH ANYTHING. But then he had broken one of his own “NEVER EVER BE LATE, TIME IS EVERYTHING”. This fascination rather his fanatic obsession with time was a well documented affair. He had won the Nobel price for his research in time but now his continuous public research was marred by the recent global ruling by the UNTCC, the time control wing of the UN, to restrict time research to the future, a dictum which my uncle failed to meet eye-to-eye. For him everything was a circle, much like his head now. “without a past there can be no future” he said. This had lead to the basement experiments. I called it the “Dexter’s laboratory”. His father having named him after the cartoon character. Fitting actually Sir Dexter Dietrich.  I woke up with a start. I must have dozed off in the chair. Where the hell was uncle Dexter? My stomach was like a raging furnace, panting to be fed. Frustrated, I banged my hand on the console. The TTP started vibrating and resonating. It sounded like a foghorn being buffeted in the wind. Atleast something was finally working. The computer screen was lit up and was showing the message “Please provide the destination time” I laughed aloud and said ‘Please take me to the beginning of time.’ Suddenly the arm clasps slammed on and the harness tightened and started to oscillate. The vibration had increased and a blue band of light fluxed its way in front of me.  I opened my eyes and found myself sitting on a rather damp rock amidst the most fabulous sight I have ever seen. Lush green foliage with animals running and jumping all around. The air, clean and fragrant. Birdcalls rang out, interspersed with the whistle of air breezing through the bamboo clumps. I jumped off the rock and tried to orient myself. I began walking around trying to recollect what had happened. One thing I was sure that I was amazingly hungry.   So I headed off in the direction of the trees which had fruits dropping off them like leaves during autumn. On the far corner I spied this stark nude couple walking hand in hand. I reached the trees and in the middle saw this rather strange apple tree. It had just one fruit, while all the others had so many. Any way the apple being my favorite, I plucked it off and bit into it.  ** END 1 **   I was well into the apple, when the nude couple walked up-to me. What was I to say? “ whateverlings, I come in peace”? I offered the half eaten apple to the lady who took a bite and offered it to the man.  ** END2 **

      Scarface – AIC  Her cascades of hair flailed around her, the sunset glistening off her strands of glossy, black silk. She unclasps her arms, and walks along the shore, the waves kissing her feet. I stood, mesmerized, soaking up her exquisiteness. Her smoldering dark eyes, with that perpetual sparkle which belied her look of sad aloofness. The aquiline nose perched over the ruby bow, which suggested a smile, which never came. The small, sinister scar that ran alongside her nose, bringing forth-untold mysteries of scuffles unknown. The long elegant neck that rest upon a divine body resplendently draped in a crimson red sari with molten gold trimming.  The sun slid behind and I rose from the park bench, biding the image of my dream woman to cleanse itself from my existence. Something I knew would never happen. I trudged my way along to the jewelers, past the restaurant where I had made the reservations for the night and dispensed instructions and ‘presents’ to the waiters and the musicians. We had been a regular sight at the joint for the three years we have been seeing each other. They, congratulated me in unison, warm gleeful smiles lighting up their faces. The musicians promised to play ‘heaven’, which was our song promptly on the dot of 9, followed by ‘will you marry me?’  I made a mental note to call Antra after picking up the ring. She had mumbled something about having to take her mother to the hospital. Thoughts caromed around my head. My cherished bachelor status was soon to be history, not that I had played the field, but still.. Antra, ever since having lost her job a month ago, had been rather persistent on the M word. It wasn’t like I had any encumbrances. I was a successful investment banker, having tasted success all through my life, except for the one fact of not having met my dream woman. Antra was the closest person I had found to her and she though perpetually bitter about it, alright with it. She called herself the ‘dreamgirl without the scar’. Often she would crack up with the suggestion that she would go get the scar done up on her surgically.   So this was it. The end of my dream and maybe the beginning of a long, happy life together. I wouldn’t even bother with such elaborate proposals for which Yes was an obvious answer, but Antra was always one for elaborate dos. She even wanted a Christian wedding with the veils and the flowers. She being a Hindu and I, a Muslim.   I walked into TBZ and looked around the resplendent store, full of gold ornaments and crimson sari clad saleswomen, feeling my wallet. Having seen the diamond section, I went up to it and gazed down at the counter, showcasing marvelous creations with diamonds glittering and enticing. ‘May I help you?’, a voice chirped. I raised my head and saw the scar. ** I stood, aghast, staring at her as if I had seen a ghost. Oh my God! Finally, it was her, this time without the usual sad face, but a rather bemused smile. A few moments later, she looked at me worried and inquired “Sir, is everything alright?”. I just shook my head and fled from the store.  I reached home, put the phones off the hook and took a long, long cold shower. I fixed myself a stiff drink and gulped it down in the recesses of my hall, staring at the intricate patterns of the rug. I looked up to find myself with the now half-empty bottle in my hand and night set in. I let a roar out in frustration in the dark room as the front door clicked open and Antra popped her head in. I mumbled a sign of welcome.  She came up-to me and gave me a tight hug and a peck on my cheek, sniffing up the air around me. She sat beside me as caressed my hair and finally asked ‘Anything I can do?’ I remained silent. She hmmed and prised the bottle from my limp hand. ‘I had gone to the hospital today’ she said. As I turned to look at her, the doorbell rang.  Antra walked upto the switchboard, turned the lights on and opened the door. ‘Hmm, I believe this is the residence of a Mr. Saeed M. He had left his wallet back at our store. Is he in? I would like to hand it over.’ Consciousness pummeled its way into me, as Antra simply moved aside and let her in. She walked up to me, still in her work uniform, the scar subdued in the dull fluorescent lighting and handed my wallet to me. “Please check it , Sir, before I leave.’ She said. I opened the wallet, pulled out a 500, and handed it to her saying ‘thank you’. She vigorously shook her head and said ‘ No Sir, that would not be necessary. But please do visit our store soon. We have some marvelous new selections coming in tomorrow. Hmm and after you are feeling better.’, she said cheekily and left, closing the door softly.   I watched her leave, my heart still missing beats after seeing her smile. I heard a soft moan from the corner. I turned to see Antra on the floor, huddled up against the wall, moaning softly. ‘Antra’, I called out. After a while, she lifted her face and looked at me, with a look of despair, tears rolling from her red-shot eyes. The tears that flowed over a new surgically made scar. ~j~

      You – AIC  Events occur in our distilled lives, transforming out perspectives, disfiguring our sensibilities and blurring the edges between rhyme and reason. One hesitates to wonder about the casual existence of daily life. We breathe, we eat, we sleep; we occupy the passing hours with jobs, hobbies, duties, pleasure and slumber, some more than the unfortunate other.  Momentarily we halt at infernal signals, with sudden pangs of compassion or scorn, zipping their emotional variations through the being. The haggard filthy-looking boy, dressed only in an extra large discolored shirt, its frayed ends nesting a bevy of colorful flies; gazing eagerly at you, with the grubby outstretched palm, beseeching your benevolence, the glazed eyes flicking incessantly to the next beseechable in view.  You grope around for some loose change, a thought immediately discarded with the lights turning get-going-green; accelerating ahead, casting a quick glance at the rapidly diminishing forlorn image in the mirror.   The image lingering, slipping through your voluminous stream of thoughts of potholes, rash bikers and that flashy blue Merc SL500, winging its path across, morphing the pity for the kid into a desire and hunger to achieve a Merc-ised lifestyle.   Panic sways your senses as your eyes return to the road, in time to avoid a collision with a swerving idiotic cyclist. Calm and order returns, with the exception of to the knees; a mental renewal of visual priorities being structured in the consideration of an assured longevity of your life.  You sweep into the graciously vacant parking space and rummage through your wallet for the parking fee, your probing fingers jingling against some coins, refreshing your dormant memory with the reminiscence of that beggar boy.  You traipse into the café, eyeing your watch, contemplating that for once you have reached early. A bleak smile breaks upon your face, spiraling into a light-hearted grin on sighting a vacant table, the remnants of the previous party’s evening tea yet to be cleared. Disregarding that, you park yourself on a chair, facing the entrance and snuggle to achieve the preferred comfort level. Your pour yourself a disposable tumbler of cool water. Why order a coffee right away when you would have to order another later anyway, when she arrived.  A cigarette lit, the smoke caroming off the table and throwing a blue hue to the sunlight streaming through the potted plants. The table, now being cleared by a smiling, rather buffoon-like attender. You gulp down the water, its refreshing qualities instilling a rejuvenated feeling towards life in general, constantly eyeing the anatomy of the busty, cute bomb in orange, just leaving the place. A despondent glance at the watch later, you settle down to watch the football match between two vague teams, being telecast on the television.  Another one of those beggar-boys comes scampering across and reaches out for the empty tumbler, his eyes asking the question. You nod and he retreats with his newest possession cradled in his hand, hidden from the accusing eyes of the café’s employees. You follow the movements of the dirty kid with a detached aloofness and lean forward as he empties the contents of the half-drunk cup of the orange bomb’s coffee into the tumbler. Your eyes lock and he breaks into an embarrassed, sheepish what-else-can-I-do-boss smile. That troublesome feeling of pity floods you again, slowly snowballing into an amazement of the ways and means by which some people have to fend for themselves.  She arrives, hurrying across the cobbled path, a fixed apology on her face. She sneaks a suspicious glance at her watch and then with a relieved grin on her face leans across, pecks you on the cheek, a chirpy ‘Hiiiee’ on her lips. You reply in kind and the usual pleasantries of a meeting follow. ‘What will you have?, you enquire. ‘A chocolate excess and a iced café mocha, please.’ You beckon the waiter and place your order, adding a cold coffee and a pound cake to the list, mentally calculating the total cost of this escapade.   Within a short minute, replete with a verbal recollection of the day’s events so far, the tray laden with your evening refreshment arrives. She digs in, apparently not having had her lunch, while you sip on your coffee, gingerly attacking the warm cake with the fork.  A flurry of movement, caught from the corner of your eyes, makes you turn around. A bustle of beggar-kids squat huddled around the erstwhile can-I-take-it-away eyes beggar-boy, frantically dipping chunks of bread into the purloined tumbler of coffee. ~j~

       nobody - aic   A commercial break sprung up just when the identity of the bad guy in the movie was about to be revealed. A dumb-looking guy who claimed to be a handsome, sexy man just because he bought a cell phone was telling us how. Surrounded by a bevy of hot women, he waved his sleek phone around. That reminded me, I was due to attend a party tonight-Yet another Saturday night, yet another party. I somehow didn’t feel like going. I surfed a few channels to pass the time before I could get back to the unmasking of the bad guy. It had to be the sweet-talking lawyer dude. Everyone else was just being thrown at your face as bad.   Channel after channel flickered past my eyes when suddenly I heard the refrains of that song again. ‘You are nobody until somebody loves you’. I switched back to that channel. Yeah, it was the same movie they had shown a month ago – Payback starring Mel Gibson. I had laughed at that time. Yea right. My love-life was non-existent, and I was still someone. I had a job I liked, friends who were caring, cool, and fun, and a decent life going places. I was nobody it seems. Bah. Some cranky heart-broken bastard trying to make a fast buck out of his washed out love life.  But today the same song stung. I hadn’t known her last month. But today, I wanted to know her for the rest of my life. Life had become a mixture of happiness, yearning, hope, and patience. I had met her in the oddest of ways. A place one least expects to find one’s complement, an ENT specialist. I had gone there to get my throat infection checked and she some problem with her ears. Never had I connected so instantly or deeply with someone; and it didn’t help that she was as pretty as a sunflower on a stormy day.  I had kept in touch with her after that first meeting at the doctor’s, and we had become good friends. The odd coffee-shop rendezvous and the phone calls became a source of intense joy and pleasure. Hours of witty, intelligent and stimulating conversation in tandem with her exquisite beauty, both inner and outer, made my life one continuous happy thought process. Not a minute passed where she didn’t sneak into my thoughts.   Never one for bold declarations of my feelings I had nevertheless got my feelings across in a roundabout fashion, only to be shown a closed door. One thing I had learnt in life was that just because you felt something for someone always didn’t mean that the other should and would reciprocate in kind. With that lesson in mind, I took the rebuff in my stride and continued as usual. Someday my love will prevail and my persistence will pay off, if not, well, life would still go on, though I somehow feel rather miserably. But hey, to love is special, and to be loved is divine, and like someone said, you can’t hurry love.  I&nbsp;joined along, singing the song with Dean Martin, suddenly feeling like a nobody.  ~j~

       Melody to a Memory – Alex. I. Conway  The night was settling into a crisp, quiet affair. I stacked up the papers and dumped them in the briefcase. Ahhh. That’s it for the day. I stretched out in the settee and looked around. I liked my house; spacious, bright, cheerful. The tall wrought-iron lamps casting a shine on the mauve walls; the black leather couch lay as a smiling beckoning maitre’d. I smiled. ‘time’s treated you good, dude’ Well, time for a drink.   I sauntered along to the bar and poured three fingers of scotch in my favorite crystal tumbler. On a second thought, I picked up the bottle of Jack Daniels and placed them on the teapoy. There. Hmm what could make it better? Music, of course. I grabbed the Audio system remote and pressed play. The 30-CD changer started whirring and a gentle voice started whispering into the night.  I settled into the couch and began sipping my drink. The liquid slid down, spreading a warm feeling through my being. I munched a peanut and looked at the view visible through the curtains of the french windows. My apartment overlooked the sea; the beam of the lighthouse periodically illuminating a portion of my living room with a pleasant pale blue light. The audio player whirred loudly and changed a CD. I sat there, marveling at the technological advances that made our lives so easy. And then it happened.   That song. That song that always brought a rush of emotions spiraling through my body. Cliff Richard’s crooning that lovely song of his. Our song. The song we danced to, the song we listened to when we were one, the song we built our dreams on. It had been so long since I’d met her. So many moments away from her. Maybe I should call her. What would she say? I sighed.   I took a sip of my drink, ambled on to my cupboard, and pulled out my shoebox. I smelt it. A faint fragrance still lingered. She used to dab a bit of her perfume in her letters and cards. To make me want to be near her, she used to say. How true. I took the box to the settee. Letter after letter, card after card; little pink, mauve, blue green satin ribbons; each of them a different place, a different time, a different memory.   I remembered the day I decided to say the words to her. My heart wanting to, my heart needing to, my mind fiercely blocking my words; it was this song that made me listen to my heart and tell her. And so I had done, not to much avail. Well so much time had passed since then, so much water under the bridge, so many memories; though memories are not what the heart desires.   Cliff Richards finished singing our song. I hit the repeat button and pondered ‘I should tell it to her again’. A theme for a dream and what a wonderful dream it was. A perfect melody for my memories. The doorbell rang. I shoved the letters back into the box and slid it under the table.I plodded to the door, and opened it. There she was, my wife, my princess, my theme, my dream, returning from work. ‘You naughty boy, listening to our song alone!’, she smiled and walked in to my outstretched arms.  ~j~

      Jedidiyah, your true talent is Business and Marketing  If there's one thing you want from your future, it's to be in charge of it. While you're happy to hear what others think, you usually have a clear plan for all of the things you want. And once you've made up your mind, it's not easy to get you off that path. You're a smooth operator who gets along well with people, but you also make sure that people know exactly what you think.   Always strategizing about the next best thing, you enjoy making decisions and directing the course of your projects. It's easy for you to see the big picture in situations, and with your cool head and keen determination, it's a safe bet that you'll be leading the pack in no time.

      jedidiyah, your signature city is Seattle   Sleepless in Seattle? We don't think so. You may be laidback but that doesn't mean you're lacking in energy. Someone as adventurous and active as you is the perfect pairing with a city that's filled with fresh air, beautiful waterfront, snow-capped mountains, and plenty to do.  Whether you're hiking, skiing, or biking, you lead the way to new heights and lots of fun. And what better place to reach new heights of fun than in your signature city? How about from the top of the Space Needle or Mt. Rainier? You can quench your need for speed in the Great Outdoors, check out a jazz club or a museum, and wash it all down with a fresh cup of java at one of the city's countless cafés — all in one day. Now that's something we can all toast to!

      jedidiyah, you're a Station Wagon!   You swore you'd never get one, but deep down you knew it was inevitable. Now it's finally happened. The car for you is a sensible, reliable, and oh-so-traditional Station Wagon. But don't panic: you haven't totally become your parents! We're not thinking a Chrysler Town & Country or even a Ford Taurus. The car for you is a hip, updated version of the classic. You've inherited everything that was cool about your folks, and taken it to the next level. Gone are the wood panels and cheesy colors, and way in are the leather interior, CD player, and gear racks for your weekend adventures. How about a Subaru Outback, Volvo V40, or a Saab Aero Wagon—in a classic navy or a firebrick red? You're so happening; no one would ever know that you've got those sensible airbags tucked away for a rainy day. http://web.tickle.com/tests/car

      jedidiyah, you're a Raccoon in the wild world of love.  Aren't you a crafty creature, Raccoon? There's a reason for that mask on your face — it makes it easier to sneak out the back door unnoticed after a late-night prank or two. You're a nocturnal prowler and a fun-loving jokester with a definite social streak. There's never a dull moment when you're up for a party or a wild night on the town. After all, who can resist a free-spirited flirt with a great sense of humor? Your abundance of charm doesn't hurt your act either. You subtly move in on your prey, sneaking out of the shadows where you plot your next punch line. Before they even know what hit them, you've left them howling with laughter and disappeared off again into the night.  It's a wonder people never tire of your rabble-rousing antics, you tease. It must be something about your mysterious allure that keeps you so fiendishly intriguing. Or maybe it's your approach to living in the moment. Life's a party and you live it and that's what makes you so irresistible!   http://web.tickle.com/tests/animal/

      i am Barnabas. i am on my way to the office. it is raining. it has been raining for a week now, almost non-stop. the city is coolish cold and wet. there is water everywhere. water on the road, water in the auto, water on the leaves, water in the gutters, water on windshields, water on raincoats. everyone walking has an umbrella. everyone! except me. so i continue my walk in the rain looking for the elusive auto.   ah. there it is. a white car splashes water on me. fucker. get into the auto and sit in the middle of the blackish grey seat. what a color! look out of the window. nice thoughts swirl through my head. i think on. tossing the idea around in my head, shaping it, seeing it through different perspectives and lights, and hues. i think arrey wah. nice one. and then i try to remember it-will write it down.   and i dont remember it. i spend 2 minutes thinking about what i had been thinking. retracing my thought patterns. a sick feeling sets in my stomach. what is going on. the nice ideas that i get, i dont remember. so where does this leave me. do i just sit and write about the experiences around the idea rather than about the idea itself. is this the first sign of the end.  ~j~

      'You could feel a little moody or thin-skinned today, Jedidiyah Alfred. Don't worry, you're not going crazy! And no, the world isn't out to get you! Your nerves could be a bit heightened because of some intense planetary energies. It's best to take frequent breaks throughout the day. You'll want to clear your head with a nice walk or some distracting coffee breaks. Don't allow other people's moods to bring you down, either!'  now i know why :|
