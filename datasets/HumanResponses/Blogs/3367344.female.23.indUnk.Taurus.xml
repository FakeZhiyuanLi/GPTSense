      A friend suggested asking ourselves the question of "How should I love others?"  I thought that I knew how to love others, but it's not such a straightforward concept and can be challenging at times.    The answer that I came up with is from 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.  This just seems to sum up all the things that love should be.   Love is patient and kind; it is not jelous or conceited or proud; love is not ill-mannered or selfish or irritable; love does not keep a record of wrongs; love is not happy with evil, but is happy with truth.  Love never gives up; and it's faith, hope and patience never fail.

      As I sit here now I'm cringing in pain.  Don't touch me or I'll scream.  I got a sunburnt bad yesterday.  It was the first really warm nice day so naturally I pulled out my lawn chair and camped out with a few good books for about 4 hours without sunscreen.  It didn't hit me till later on when my shins looked fire engine red and were bright flaming hot.  I guess I forgot the powers of the sun.  This happens to me every year, and I probably won't remember to wear sunscreen next year either.   Anyway the whole wearing sunscreen advice reminds me of the ever popular graduation rant a few years ago.  I thought I'd include in this blog just for kicks.  I've recently graduated from nursing school.  The advice we will remember was given to us by a classmate when a teacher asked for any last bits of wisdom we'd like to share. She said "Please, please...always wear your seatbelt."  She had worked in the trauma unit of a hospital and saw young people come in from car accidents without a mark on them that later died from internal injuries that may have been prevented if they were wearing seatbelts. Very sad.   So wear sunscreen and seatbelts!   Take care of yourselves everyone :-)   Without further ado...  Wear sunscreen.  If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they've faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.  Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blindside you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.  Do one thing every day that scares you.  Sing.  Don't be reckless with other people's hearts. Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.  Floss.  Don't waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind. The race is long and, in the end, it's only with yourself.  Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.  Stretch.  Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don't.  Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when they're gone.  Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else's.  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don't be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own.  Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.  Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.  Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.  Get to know your parents. You never know when they'll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They're your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.  Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft. Travel.  Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.  Respect your elders.  Don't expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you'll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.  Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.  Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.  But trust me on the sunscreen.

      I woke up early this Saturday morning in hopes of finding some wonderful treasure at a garage sale.  But before I went out I kept in mind that I already own too much stuff in this world.  I had done some tidying and given away some stuff to the church garage sale so I believe I was justified in buying a few treasures.   I ended up with a bright red smurf book bag (25cents) and a green handmade knit cardigan sweater (loonie).  I bought the smurf bag for practical reasons, I needed a library book bag and it's also a bit nostalgic.  The sweater was a treasure for sure.  It fits wonderfully, has cables going down the front and sleeves, a working zipper, a nice warm collar, two pockets and came freshly washed.  And I wear it now even as I write this blog.   I will admit I have way too many sweaters.  I think I have a problem.  I just can't seem to pass up a sweater that someone has carefully made by hand and is now the item in a thrift store.  I made a sweater once so I know what it's like...it's takes a long time and it can be painstakingly frustrating to get all the proper stitches in the right place.  And every stitch is carefully linked to the next to make a beautiful pattern.    While sweaters may not always be in style, I wear my sweaters with pride.  I feel like I am giving them new life.  The one good thing about living where I live is that spring time is a little later than everywhere else and you can wear sweaters for the whole month of May and sometimes June and July on cool nights.  I wear my sweaters in the morning when I take my dog for walks.  When I'm studying I like to curl up in a sweater and sip a cup of tea.  You might say that I have a sweater for every occasion, and that's okay.       My most favorite sweater of all is one that used to belong to a friend of mine.  She would wear that sweater when we would sit and eat sandwiches on her front steps or if she wanted to show me her garden.  She's passed away now, but I wear her sweater often and think fondly of her whenever I do.    So for me a handmade sweater is a treasure indeed.  It's like a warm hug on a cold day.  And finding one more has just made my day.

      Wouldn’t it be nice to be dog. You know, people always say ‘it’s a dog’s life’…and things like that.  Well in this day and age dog’s aren’t thought of as ordinary everyday pets.  People’s dogs have become one of the family, like children.  They even get spoiled like children too.  There are spas for dogs, special dog treat shops and even designer clothing.  Books explaining dog psychology like  How to speak Dog by Stanley Coren   even exist in hopes of better understanding our canine companions.    Well at least my dog gets spoiled anyway.  When I left the house to go to school my parents adopted a dog.  When I came home from school I didn’t have a bedroom anymore.  It was half sewing room half dog’s room complete with a range of squeaky toys to choose from.  But that’s okay we love our dog and isn’t it up to us to say where she she’s allowed to sleep?    Just think what the daily life of a dog is like.  Wake up in the morning and go outside to get some fresh air and do your business.  Come back inside sleep on the couch for awhile.  Go for a nice long walk on the beach stopping to sniff at every corner to see what others have come before to mark their territory.  Then coming home to relax and nap some more.  Whenever someone comes in the house it’s exciting and a squeaky toy is presented in the hopes of playing keep away.  Dinner time is another exciting point of the day especially if something particularly good was barbequed.  Then in the evening perhaps another walk or maybe the hockey game will be on.  And then it’s time to fall asleep and dream and do it all over again tomorrow.   And then of course there is Lassie.  Oh how I weep and cry whenever I hear of a tale where a dog has miraculously saved a life.  It’s almost as if dogs have a sixth sense for danger or something. Maybe humans and dogs are more closely related than we think.  We need dogs and dogs need us, sort of a symbiotic relationship.  After all it’s a well known fact that the simple act of petting a dog is relaxing and can even lower blood pressure, not to mention all the exercise that one would get from walking a dog.    Well perhaps in my next life, if I have good karma, I’ll ask to be a dog.  Woof. Woof.

      Well what can I say.  We live in a world surrounded by media that tells us that we aren't fit the way we are and need to improve.  Fashion magazines are mostly ads and that's the reason I don't read them anymore.  The T.V. is full of shows like The Swan and Extreme Makeover where everyone can magically be beautiful by the wonders of plastic surgery.  What have we done?  We no longer feel comfortable in our own skin?  We have to be better?  What is beautiful?  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder?  Did you know that in ancient times it was actually better to have more curves and fat on your body because it showed that you were healthy. Now look at us we can't seem to accept the way our body just are naturally.    I've written a poem.  The lines in the poem were all taken from various beauty ads in a magazine.  Here it is:   Natural Beauty is Obsolete  It's a technological breakthrough!  Colour so multi-faceted it shimmers. Hours and hours of colour that actually improves lips' moisture. Stress relief for your skin. Deep cleans and removes makeup. Non-comedogenic formula that is gentle for the skin and dries     fast with no greasy residue. The equivalent of 5,000 liters of spa water in a jar. It cleans so deeply you actually feel it working!  And now it comes in a unique soft touch bottle that's really     easy to handle. Visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines in just 4 weeks. Simply irresistible.        May 22, 04      - Amanda    Yeah right, you haven't sold me.  I'm not a slave to beauty.  I like me for who I am, me, au nautral.

      Well although I'm fairly new at this blogging thing I have to say that I'm enjoying it a lot.  I have no set schedule for the day so it's nice to be able to sit back a bit and reflect on the things I see around me.  I read the newspaper from front to back every day.  I take my dog for walks along the beach or through a nature trail.  I ride my bike all the way around the perimeter of town.  And all the while I'll be thinking and reflecting and enjoying the world around me.    I've always been one who enjoys writing little bits down each day.  I've kept journals and diaries and written the occasional story now and then.  This skill of journalling actually came in helpful in nursing since we had to do a weekly journal for our 'integration' class.  Most of the people in my class were opposed to journalling and saw it as a waste of time, but not me.  I liked having a place to write down my thoughts about my learning and my progress as I moved closer to becoming a nurse.  In fact the College of Nurses of Ontario actually requires nurses to do reflective practice at least once a year, reviewing goals and achievements. Sometimes I think that things happen so quickly that they can easily be forgotten or glossed over.  If you take a moment to look back and reflect on events then you may just see something, some value or a lesson to be learned.    I was a bit nervous about the idea of posting things on the internet for everyone in the world to see.  The way that I've approached these blogs is to think of my blogspot as if I was publishing it in a newspaper or saying it out loud on CBC radio.  I can get personal without getting personal.    I will continue on with blogs.  I have lots of ideas in my head to share with the world.  It doesn't really matter to me who reads these.  I consider these blogs like books on shelves waiting to be read by anyone passing by.

      I was feeling a bit isolated so I went out for an adventure in the world of socializing.  I knew they wouldn't bite, in fact I was used to hanging around with people of this sort.  So I headed off to the seniors drop in centre for a few hands of crib.    I knew one of the ladies because she had babysat me a long time ago, and we also had a common friend that we would visit.  Anyway I phoned her up and asked if she'd like to play some cards and she invited me to the seniors centre where many would gather in the afternoon to socialize.    I met quite a few people that I'd seen but had never really talked to before.  I quite enjoy the company of seniors.  It would seem that they have something that many people today have lost.  They have the art of conversation.  Even if there is nothing happening around them they still manage to converse and joke and carry on with socializing.    One of the best jobs that I'll probably ever have was one where I actually got paid decent money to play crib.  I worked for two summers at the hospital where I was a recreation assistant.  I would simply spent time with people.  We'd do some gardening, bake a cake, play bingo, go for walks and of course play crib.  Imagine getting paid to play cards.  If only I could do that for a living, I'd be in heaven.    But it's not so much the cards that I'm after.  I really enjoy the company and the conversation.  I especially love hearing first hand stories and tales from a time long ago.  These people have lived through the depression of the 30's, the second world war, the cold war and everything else up until now.  Time machines.    I only hope that some day when I am old that I can tell my stories and play some cards and look back on my life fondly as I will have made many friends and many memories.    P.S. The silly names were made up to keep score for our game of golf.  It's fun to pretend sometimes.  I got to be Dolly.

      Okay so Paul Martin called an election on Sunday. Hmmm.. that means I have to vote.  I've done it before.  Yes I remember back when I was 19 and just recently become eligible to vote I voted with glee as I embraced my new right.  Now that I'm 23 and have been out in the world a bit more I should be ready to vote.  I have a chance to have my say.  We live in a democracy, a fair country where everyone chooses who should be the leader.  Well I wish I could say that I was happy to vote but I'm not, I'm nervous.    You see, I really don't have a clue about politics.  I don't know how long the PM is supposed to be in power for, I don't know what all the MP's do, I don't really understand how bills get passed.  I haven't a clue as to what the parties are for...and I hate to admit it but I just barely know who is running.  You see this is one area that I'm not strong in at all.  The only reason I know the bit about the election being called is because I happened to be listening to CBC radio's program  Madly off in all directions  when it was interrupted to announce Paul Martin's election call.  I'm ashamed, I admit I should be more intune with the world.  At least I took a visit to the Parliament  buildings while I still lived in Ottawa, that ought to count for something.    But I will vote.  And I will do my research.  I will have a say.  One of our teachers told us the startling fact that less than 5% of nurses vote.  It was hard to believe considering the number of nurses we have in this country.  Also hard to comprehend is that nurses want their voice to be heard but yet don't vote?  Is it the long 12 hour days that leave no time for politics? It's mind boggling.    But I don't think I'm alone, and the nurses aren't the only people that don't vote.  I think that there are many people in Canada that only really get interested in politics when elections are called.  Even then people may not be as well informed of the issues as perhaps they should be.  Are we a passive people?  Is it right to have everyone voting when not everyone is well informed of the issues presented?  Hmmm..   In other news:  Saturday President Bush was mountain biking and fell off his bike and got a few scratches and bruises.   Obviously this needs national attention as it was aired on CBC radio's news.  I had to laugh.

      Today was the first day that I saw a dandelion on the lawn.  If you ask me what my favorite flower is I might just say dandelions. Strange I know, considering most people think of dandelions as weeds. They are so much more. They are bright bursts of gold, reminders of life and perseverance, wish makers and a taste of summer memories. We should learn to love them because they are here to stay, no matter how hard we try to get rid of them they always come back.    It's no coincidence that my favorite book is Dandelion Wine by Ray Bradbury. I have an annual tradition of reading it every summer. This long weekend should be the perfect time for leisurely reading.    Here's a part I'd like to share: 'Every year,' said Grandfather. 'They run amuck; I let them. Pride of lions in the yard. Stare, and they burn a hole in your retina. A common flower, a weed that no one sees, yes. But for us, a noble thing, the dandelion.'... Dandelion wine.  The words were summer on the tongue... Peer through it at the wintry day- the snow melted to grass, the trees were reinhabitated with bird, leaf, and blossoms like a continent of butterflies breathing on the wind.  And peering through, color sky from iron to blue.   -   Ray Bradbury, Dandelion Wine    I hope everyone enjoys the long weekend!

      IT IS DANGEROUS TO READ NEWSPAPERS   While I was building neat castles in the sandbox, the hasty pits were filling with bulldozed corpses   and as I walked to the school washed and combed, my feet stepping on the cracks in the cement detonated red bombs.   Now I am grownup and literate, and I sit in my chair as quietly as a fuse  and the jungles are flaming, the under- brush is charged with soldiers, the names on the difficult maps go up in smoke.   I am the cause, I am a stockpile of chemical toys, my body is a deadly gadget, I reach out in love, my hands are guns, my good intentions are completely lethal.  Even my passive eyes transmute everything I look at to the pocked black and white of a war photo, how can I stop myself   It is dangerous to read newspapers.  Each time I hit a key on my electric typewriter, speaking of peaceful trees  another village explodes.   - Margaret Atwood    Today's News:  Over 40 dead as U.S. copter fires on desert house in Iraq on Wednesday.  The victims included 15 children and 10 women.  The body of a girl who appeared to be less that five years of age lay in a white sheet, her legs riddled with wounds and her dress soaked in blood. The U.S. military said the target was a suspected safehouse for foreign fighters from Syria.  Revellers had fired celebratory gun fire into the air in a traditional wedding celebration before the attack took place.  "Is this the democracy and freedom that Bush has brought us?"..."There was no reason."

      Home decorating shows have taken a new turn these days.  There are shows for the sole purpose of tidying a person's house and getting rid of clutter.  If you watch one of these shows you'll marvel at all of the things people have stowed away over the years.  Most of the items are sorted out into piles, keep, toss and throw away.  At the end of the show the newly sorted out room has a much more zen feeling that brings about relaxation versus the old stressful room.  I myself am guilty of being a pack rat and frequent garage sales much too often.  I am starting to learn to only buy things that I really need and occasionally an item that I want purely for my enjoyment.  I just find it so ironic that we complain about high gas prices and yet we spend our money on junk that ends up being thrown out anyway.  There are people in this world who have a lot less than we do.  Somehow I feel this sense of guilt as if I am mocking them by filling my life with objects while people go hungry.  The reality is that this is the world we live in.  There must be something we can do to change it?

      Hello again world, It's nice and sunny outside today which has motivated me to do something..mainly study.  I've been reviewing maternity and child bearing issues.  It's really amazing how the whole system works to ensure that babies are born and moms are okay too.  Well I guess we have modern medical technology to thank for decreased infant and maternal death rates although mother nature plays a huge role in the whole birthing process.    Here's my amazing fact of the day: Clamping of the cord at birth brings changes in fetal circulation: closure of the foramen ovale (opening between the left and right atria during fetal life that bypasses fetal lungs) and ductus arteriosis (another bypass of the fetal lungs) and the obliteration of the umbilical arteries produce an adult like circulation within 1 hour.   The fact that we all breathe now and at one time when we were born had took that first breath to start our outside life in this world is amazing.  We all have something in common...we are human.

      Hello Everyone, Well here I am world.  My words and thoughts are out there for everyone to see.  I'm a little hesitant to post my innermost thoughts and feelings out there.  I'll have to maintain a certain level of self disclosure I guess.  At any rate this blog spot thing in general is a good idea.  I enjoy writing my thoughts down and now perhaps someone will actually read them.    My thought of the day: You can only go up from here.  And yes I was thinking of the Shania Twain song UP.  I think I'm at one of the all time lows of my life.  I'm hesitant to go into details but that's how I feel sometimes.  And when you are at the bottom of it all you just have to think...well you can only go up from here.  And that's what I'll do.  Look up.

      This weekend I am honoured to stand up for one of my dear friends at her wedding.  I get to be a bridesmaid!    Now usually bridesmaids are though of as something you never want to be, or get stuck being.  As the saying goes 'always a bridesmaid and never a bride'.  Well frankly, I'd rather be the bridesmaid right now.  I'm not quite ready to be a bride.   And that's the great part about it all - I can enjoy all the wonderful things a wedding has to bring but without any of the pressure felt by the bride.  I get to have my hair done in a nice 'up do' and wear an elegant evening gown (don't worry it's not teal!), and just enjoy a night of dressing up and dancing. And I am really happy that I can take part in my friend's special day.    There's just one question.  What if I catch the bouquet?  I have to be honest with everyone out there - I've already caught one! And I'm  single (well I like to say liberated)! If I catch two will I be doomed to loneliness for life or will it bring me twice as much luck in finding Mr. Right?     Another good thing about being in the wedding party is that you automatically get to dance with your walking down the isle groomsmen partner.  I guess that can't be too bad then.  Except that I've heard that so far I'm the tallest person in the whole wedding party - and I'm wearing flats!  Hmmm...  Well my dad will be there too so if all else fails I will dance with him.    Anyway I'm going to enjoy this wedding to the fullest.  I'm such a sucker for romance I'll probably ball my eyes out so I'm definitely not wearing mascara.  But I will dream about my own wedding with my one true love (I just know he's out there somewhere) and daydream about fairytale happily ever after endings...

       Oh oh..Here she comes..Watch out boys she'll chew you up..Oh oh..Here she come..She a man eater!..   Mary:  If feminists are so dreaded then perhaps one should know what one looks like in order to avoid them.  I am told they are bitter and wear no bras. They don't even go to the salon they go to the barber. Their hands are rough from doing a hard days work. Their minds are sharp as a tack. And their mouths open and close carefully at precisely the right moments to have the most impact. They have fangs and claws that are used to hunt and fight. They fear no one and go after what they want taking no bull from no one.  But what do they look like?  They must be hideous monstrous manly like women who are unkempt and rugged.  Have you actually seen a feminist?  And did she look like that?  Jane:  Well no, she didn't.  She was strong and smart and beamed out confidence. She sat upright in her chair and looked me straight in the eye.  And she was beautiful.  Her hair was done nicely and she had nail polish on.  She wore a sundress that flattered her figure.  She had on nice shoes too.  Her teeth were white and she wore makeup.  Mary:  How could she be strong and smart and all those things if she looked like an ordinary woman?  Jane:  Apparently hairspray doesn't destroy brain cells as previously thought.  Mary:  But she's evil!  Feminists are dreaded people.  They are even called man haters!  Jane:  This one was married and had 2 kids.   Mary:  And she was still smart, strong, confident and went after the things that she wanted?  Jane:  Yes.   Mary:  Isn't it against their beliefs to be married?  Jane:  Well only if you become someone you are not.  Besides the modern marriage is nothing like it was back then.  Men can stay at home with the children and even cook and clean.  Ignorance is no excuse anymore; it wasn't that difficult for the male species to learn these tasks.  And sometimes the woman even makes more money than the man and it causes no problems.    Mary:  But surely he wears the pants when it comes down to it?  Jane:  In fact they both wear pants.  Mary:  But he's somehow smarter than her by default.  I mean it's just naturally that way.  Jane:  Um...no.  Men and women are equal when it comes to brain power.  In fact did you know that there are more women in med school then men right now.  Mary:  I'd sure like to meet her.  Jane:  Well that's easy, she's sitting right in front of you.   Don't you see, feminists are everywhere.     Amanda June 19,04

      Brrr...it's cold. It says it 10 degrees C out there but it's cold.  I might have to resort to wearing my winter coat and gloves if I go out fishing.  I don't even feel like leaving my house.  In fact me and my dog cuddled under blankets all morning while watching Dawson's creek.  Okay so I've seen every episode of that silly show but some how I just can't manage to get going in the morning and the couch and T.V. just seem to be calling me.  It's the weather I tell you.  If it was nicer outside I'd take the dog for a walk or ride my bike or do someting...but when it's cold and foggy (as it often is) I just want to curl up with a good book or a movie and a cup of hot chocolate.    Summer I know you're out there!  Come and pay me a visit and we'll have lots of fun.

      Well I'm not quite addicted but have bought a few things from e-bay.  So far 2 labtops that worked great and were bought for cheep came from there.  I've just bid on something I've been wanting for a while now.  I'm an independent person and I've got a credit card so I can do what I want!  And hopefully it will work out.   You may think I'm crazy when I tell you that I want to play Atari.  Some of you may not have even heard of Atari, probably before your time.  But I want to hook it up and pop in those game cartriges of asteroids, pacman, pong, centipede and what have you and see my tv screen blink and shine like it used to.  To hold that old fashioned joy stick in my hand and really feel the characters move on the screen would be such joy! I guess I'm old fashioned when it comes to video games.  I never caught on to the idea of 3-D computer games.  Nintendo is okay - but I still haven't mastered Mario (have to continue game every time because I always die in some silly hole or something, and I hate the kupas).    Anyway, I have an Atari and I've tried to get it to work.  I've bought a new adaptor, tested all the switches, hooked it all up but no go.  I don't know what's wrong and it's probably not worth it to fix so I'll just buy one that does.  And I'm going to try e-bay.    If by chance anyone out there has one that works and wants to sell it to me let me know.  Until then I'll be e-baying and garagesaling with persistance!

      Once upon a time there was a retired man who decided to make a park.  He just went ahead and built a bridge and made a trail and then put some picnic tables there.  He spent many days and years working away by himself in the park.  Eventually the park became well known and was named after him.    But the man was old and after many years of hard work he died.    The park is still there but has no keeper.  So one day a group of people who were friends with the man decided to form a committee to keep the park in good shape.    There were only a few people on the committee and they were busy people who couldn't spend as much time working in the park as the man but they did what they could.  They held clean up days and did some repairs and raised money to help fix things up.     Then one day someone decided it would be a really great idea to have a sign describing the park and the man who built it.    This was easier said than done.  How would we build this sign?  What kind of information should we put on it?  Where do we put it?  How do we put the sign up?  And so on and so on...  The sign took a lot longer than expected but it eventually got built.  With persistence and patience the group worked together to eventually accomplish a goal.    Sometimes more heads aren't better than one when it comes to making decisions.  There has to be some room for compromise and everyone's opinion should be taken into account.  Working in a group can be very beneficial as more things can be done with more people to do them.  However lines of communication must not be broken and everyone should try to keep focused on the ultimate goal.

       Finntown near Hawk Junction, Ontario Canada. Located 14 miles N.E. of Wawa on highway 547   Hi Susan! I was thinking of you when I picked up this postcard.  I'm doing well. I've just graduated from nursing school and I'm on my way in life.  I've been spending a bit of time at the camp just relaxing.  Your old house is still standing beautifully and I'm sure all the kids in the attic are behaving too.  I just wanted to say thank you for all the wonderful chats we've had.  I will remember your witty sayings always.  'Eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might not need any!' Say hi to Freda for me, it must be nice to be together again.  Love, Amanda (Muriel) P.S. I'm sure that you will get this postcard.  I'm still waiting for mine *wink*   Susan Morden c/o Saint Peter Pearly Gates Beyond the Clouds HEA VEN   Sent June 22, 2004

      One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally, he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway; it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.  He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement he quieted down.   A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well. He was astonished at what he saw. With each shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon,  everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of  the well and happily trotted off!  Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up.  Remember the five simple rules to be happy:  1. Free your heart from hatred - Forgive.  2. Free your mind from worries - Most never happen.  3. Live simply and appreciate what you have.  4. Give more.  5. Expect less  NOW --------  Enough of that crap . . ..  The donkey later came back and bit the shit out of the farmer who had tried to bury him. The gash from the bite got infected, and the farmer eventually died in agony from septic shock.  MORAL FROM TODAY'S LESSON:  When you do something wrong and try to cover your ass,  it always comes back to bite you.

      Dear Mr.C  I just wanted you to know I’m doing fine.  I was just remembering all those art classes I sat through in grade 11.    I still do art.  I paint and draw and sketch and write.  I haven’t given up.  I’ve kept at it.  You told me to put the details in pictures.  Put the leaves on the trees.  I said ‘what leaves I can only see green’.   ‘No look can’t you see the leaves and branches’  ‘No’ I said.   It was then I realized that I might need glasses and my view was insufficient.   You also said I coloured out of the lines.  So be it.  I did.   I used too much paint and my picture didn’t look like the photograph I was trying to copy.    There are power in threes you said.  Really?  I like four, five, and six too.  I just wanted to say thank you for giving me a B-.  I never could get those shadows on boxes perfectly right after all.    I am still an artist although you may differ with me.  You see, I didn’t paint my picture to match the sofa.  I did it to match me.   Sincerely, A.

      It's something that needed to be done so I did it.  I cleaned the bathroom today.  I had nothing better to do and I knew that I should do it so I did.  I absolutely hate cleaning bathrooms! Yuck!   I not bragging about how it good it was of me to clean the bathroom.  In fact I really hate doing it and it took me over a month to come to terms with the fact that our bathroom needed a good cleaning.   There is nothing more disgusting than mystery hairs or pink and green scum under shampoo bottles.  So I armed myself well.  I went in fully prepared with hair up, gloves on and the bathroom fan on full tilt.   As I was cleaning I thought of the days where I actually cleaned bathrooms and got paid to do it. In fact it was only last summer that I did that very thing. I've worked at several hotels and a fishing lodge where day in and day out we would clean the same bathrooms.  You could spend a whole morning just cleaning bathrooms.  I have to admit that if given the choice I always opted for making back breaking queen sized beds over cleaning the bathroom.  I was a horrible chambermaid.   I'm not by any means saying that cleaning bathrooms is somehow less respectful of a job.  After all bathrooms need to be cleaned and someone has to do it.  In fact maybe those people deserve the most respect for they have the courage to tackle anything with vim and vigor and make those faucets shine! There is nothing more wonderful than a hotel bathroom, for these are meticulously cleaned with not a water streak or stay hair to be found.  And it's always a good idea to tip the chambermaids,  believe me they deserve it.    Well I really have no other purpose for this blog other than to say that bathrooms need cleaning and I praise all that do the dirty work and get the job done. Perhaps clean bathrooms are another thing we shouldn't take for granted.

      A ninety-two-year old man went to the doctor to get a physical. A few days later the doctor saw the man walking down the street with a gorgeous young lady on his arm.    At his follow-up visit the doctor talked to the man and said, "You're really doing great, aren't you?"  The man replied, "Just following doctor's orders.  You said, 'Get a hot mamma and be cheerful.' "  The doctor chuckled, "I didn't say that at all. I said you got a heart murmur, Be careful."     - Daily Nursing Joke Calender

      Why don't we have celebrations of life? Sad funerals come mere moments too late. Dead ears are deaf to the kind words we say. Let's celebrate precious life instead. A smile, a hug, a warm embrace, a handshake, a kiss Let's say 'I love you' to ears that hear.  The artist who starves today would eat tomorrow It's sunny and warm today, The cold and grey days will come all too soon.  Without further ado celebrate! For the golden sun shines brightly today!   Amanda  June 14th 2004   I think it rather strange that we remember and say such nice things about people only after they have died and cannot appreciate things.  I think of Ronald Reagan and Ray Charles who were remembered this past week.  There is surely someone close to us all that could use a thought of remembering and kind words before their time on earth is through.

      1 blank notebook 1 writing instrument of any colour or material of choice 1 penny 1 dandelion that has gone to seed A dash of creativity 1 open mind  Begin by picking up penny and holding it firmly between thumb and indexfinger.  Eventually it will bring out thoughts.  Select a writing instrument and begin to fill empty notebook with internal monologue.  If feeling melancoly take dandelion gone to seed and make a wish while blowing into the wind.  Use a dash of creativity to season to taste.  Serve to open mind when ready.

      I've just completed the RN exam whoohoo!  I've jumped through the last hoop on my way to becoming a nurse and it feels good.  The exam went well.  It was long though and took me 6 hours to write.  Now all I have to do is relax and wait 6-8 weeks to get the results back and in the mean time I could start looking around for jobs.  It just feels so good to have a clear mind.  I'm going out to my camp this weekend and I'm not bringing any nursing books with me!   If you're like me and love bubble wrap check this out!  http://fun.from.hell.pl/2003-11-24/bubblewrap.swf (I don't know why it's fun from hell..to me it's just fun...)

      Dear Mother Ruth: What do you think of slang?  Is there any harm in saying "Go to it," "Darn it," and "Gee Wiz," and things like that?  I am continually being 'called down' for such expressions.  I think that it means more when you say some things in slang. - School Girl  My Dear Girl:  It does seem a pity that today the American girl has come to use slang in such a free way that she is known all over the world by her speech.  Occasionally you hear a great speaker make a clear point by an expression of the street, or slang, but no one can do it many times and be considered refined.  Generally they weaken their point.  Did you ever think there is a "profanity of slang"? If any one called you profane, you no doubt would resent it, but nevertheless many of these expressions are profanity, and it is a thing that grows upon one and becomes a habit, especially among you high school girls and in the business world.   Girls (who make our women) should create and hold around them an atmosphere free from coarseness and vulgarity.  Slang detracts from this, and men can expect to take liberties where there is a looseness and carelessness of speech.  Learn to bridle your tongue (James 1:26).  David prayed as we should pray, "Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips" (Psa. 141:3).    Girls Problems of Today  published 1923 by The Bible Institute Colportage Ass'n   Amanda says:  Maybe mother Ruth was right after all ...where does slang and foul language get us.  It's true that the words we speak from our mouth (and type with our fingers) represent us, our attitudes, and our way of communicating with the world.  Although the examples used above are quite tame...it make you think that the things we think are bad now might be considered tame in the future?  Hmmm..

      I can proudly say that I have gone over a year without using a clothes dryer.  I do my laundry on nice days and hang it outside to dry.  There's nothing better than fresh laundry from the great outdoors.  Isn't it funny that the makers of fabric softeners and dryer sheets have tried to capture the scents of spring and sell them back to us.  We already have them...outside.  I guess I'm fortunate to live in a place that has clothesline and room outside to hang clothes.    You might be wondering what I did in the wintertime.  Let me tell you my story.  I lived in a house with three male roommates and we owned a washer but no dryer.  When I went to go and look at the place for the first time I was filled with glee as I been going to the laundromat for 3 winters before that and having a washer and dryer would have been great.  As I soon discovered we lacked a dryer.  The explanation was that our neighbor's needed one and we had to give them ours since the landlord lived with us.  At first I grumbled and complained and even went to the trouble of doing laundry at a friends house.  But soon I learned the tricks of the trade.  I hung my laundry inside on a clothesline in the basement.  It took about a day or overnight to dry and I could only fit one load at a time on it.  This meant planning out what to wear a little more carefully.  Also I was hesitant to hang my unmentionables on the line for everyone to see so I bought a gullwing clothesdrying rack just for that.  It took a bit more patience but it worked fine.    After all  they didn't have dryers until recently.  I think the sun is a much better use of energy anyway.  And you get that nice spring scent for free.    So if you ever have to choose between getting a dryer and getting something else...just think..it is possible to live without a dryer.

      About every month or so there comes a point when I just have had enough.&nbsp; Enough of my&nbsp;messy bedroom.&nbsp; Two great big green garbage&nbsp;bags and three diet pepsi's later&nbsp;later I end up with a livable space.&nbsp; It all began while I was searching for some long lost Barbie memorabilia...and ended up with sorting and moving furniture and a little trip down memory lane.&nbsp;   My mom and I spent the better part of last night's rainy evening cleaning out my room.&nbsp; It's something we've done over and over again when it needs doing.&nbsp; It's just so much fun to rearrange the furniture and set things up differently, good energy = better feng shui.&nbsp; The problem is the five boxes of picture frames, jewel cases, and candles that I had left over from my last move.&nbsp; There's no place like home...but when you try to pack in an extra apartmentful&nbsp;of stuff it can be a bit&nbsp;crowded.&nbsp; That being said eventually I'm supposed to get my own place and move everything out that I've brought in.&nbsp;   I'm the sort of person who has kept every toy I ever played with.&nbsp; After 23 years of collecting and hoarding all my junk I realize that some of it is just junk.&nbsp; Then again perhaps all those McDonald's toys from the 80's might fetch a fair price on e-bay.&nbsp; I would love a digital camera right now...I'd be rich!&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there are things I'll never part with.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's the smurfette hat that was part of a skating costume that will never get thrown out, the barn my mom made out of a cardboard box painted red, brownie and girl guide badges so dutifully earned and so on and so on.&nbsp; Clean sweep is just not in my vocabulary.&nbsp; I like my stuff, just sometimes it needs a bit of rearranging now and then.&nbsp;   Did I mention that a third of my room is a sewing room?&nbsp; So a third of the mess is not technically mine.&nbsp; This is what happens when we leave the nest...and then come home.&nbsp; Oh well...I'm happy and I'm home and for now everything is just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      My first impressions of Sylvia Plath came from my textbook for a death and dying psychology course.&nbsp; Her story is in the chapter about suicide.&nbsp; It would seem she is famous for being the&nbsp;writer who commit suicide.&nbsp; Therefore I was lead to think she was just some poor depressed poet who took her own life.   It wasn’t until I read the book: Letter’s Home by Sylvia Plath that I began to understand who she really was.&nbsp; The book is made up of hundreds of letters spanning over a decade of writing to her mother.&nbsp; Here we see that her mother was&nbsp;her closest friend&nbsp;and was often confided in.&nbsp; It is through these personal letters that we can get a glimps of another side of&nbsp;Sylvia Plath.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Sylvia was human and she faced the everyday struggles that we all have.&nbsp; She strived to do her best and make a living by writing.&nbsp; She was very well educated,&nbsp;had married a suitable match and was a mother of two.&nbsp; But as she struggled to make her living her marriage fell apart and the tensions began to rise. &nbsp;The stamina to take care of her two children and be able to write eventually wore off.&nbsp; She struggled to be happy and not isolated but as her energy drained she eventually took her own life.&nbsp;   This was a book that I took a long time to read.&nbsp; I knew that every page I turned brought me a little bit closer to the tragic end.&nbsp; The last letter to her mother is somewhat misleading and anticlimactic as she describes her plans for the future, and how she was going to achieve her goals.&nbsp; Perhaps she was good at hiding her emotions in her letters while subtly revealing her true self through her writing.&nbsp; I have read a few of her poems, and some do disclose personal struggles she had.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I no longer think of Sylvia as just a poor depressed soul, but as a strong and courageous woman.&nbsp; Through her letters I have seen her struggles and triumphs as she worked her way up to becoming a famous writer.&nbsp; And also considering that she had a career as a writer and was a mother of two in the 60’s shows that she was not afraid to break free from the social norms expected of women.&nbsp;  I have not yet seen the movie Sylvia, but I look forward to it.&nbsp; I think we should celebrate her life and not be so obsessed over her death.&nbsp; She was a beautiful person and I feel that I know her just a little bit better now.&nbsp;

       One day Margaret, Alanis, and Sylvia all came over for tea.&nbsp;    I made gingerbread men for treats.    Margaret bit the head off first.    Alanis licked hers and then bit off his head.    And Sylvia dunked hers in the tea and then bit the head off.    I nibbled on the foot, and then the hands and then the body,    Saving the head for last.    But I was too full to eat the rest,    So I left it there on my plate    Smiling back at me.    Eventually I fed it to the dog. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   - Amanda Jayne    July 24, 04

       It's funny, or rather not really funny at all when people use sarcasm.&nbsp; I just don't&nbsp;enjoy listening to a conversation that is saturated with sarcastic undertones.&nbsp; I think it's because sarcasm is usually used in a negative way, to make fun of something, and   urlLink  Merriam-Webster    agrees.&nbsp; It just sounds better when you speak the truth in plain language.&nbsp; For example say 'I caught a small fish' instead of 'look at the whopper I just caught' while holding a small fish.&nbsp;     I suppose there is a time when sarcasm can be used tactfully, but I find that it's overused and can often lead to&nbsp;wounded feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean have you ever been in a situation where you didn't know if the person was being sarcastic or not?&nbsp; It can be quite embarrassing.&nbsp; The internet is&nbsp;not a good medium for sarcasm since your tone and facial expressions cannot be conveyed and therefore you could easily be mistaken.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So I guess what I'm saying is:&nbsp; use sarcasm sparingly .&nbsp; Language&nbsp;is beautiful,&nbsp;when used responsibly. &nbsp; &nbsp;    Pronunciation: 'sär-"ka-z&m     &nbsp;   Function: noun     &nbsp;   Etymology: French or Late Latin; French sarcasme, from Late Latin sarcasmos, from Greek sarkasmos, from sarkazein to tear flesh, bite the lips in rage, sneer, from sark-, sarx flesh; probably akin to Avestan thwar&s- to cut     &nbsp;   1 : a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain      &nbsp;   2 a : a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter, caustic, and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual b : the use or language of sarcasm

       It could be true that smoke follows beauty.&nbsp; I certainly had my share of campfire smoke in my eyes this past week as&nbsp;I tagged along on a camping trip with a good friend and her family.&nbsp;   I don't know what it is but I actually enjoy trying to survive with minimal necessities.&nbsp; The great outdoors is such a wonderful peaceful place.&nbsp; The loons calling across the water, the warm campfire, a hammock to lie in and read for hours...ah what bliss.&nbsp;   But why then do we go out and buy things that remind us of home? &nbsp;Do we really need battery operated T.V.'s, cell phones, radios...?&nbsp; Isn't it more fun to try to survive without all the things we have in civilization.&nbsp; I mean it wasn't that long ago that we didn't have these things.&nbsp; A hundred years ago people didn't have air conditioners. Imagine.&nbsp;   Okay so I will admit that even I, a die hard Little House On The Prairie fan, enjoy the comfort of modern technology.&nbsp; Thank goodness for flush toilets anyhow.&nbsp; But then there are days when I really would like to live a much simpler life.&nbsp; I've always toyed with the idea of joining the Amish people.&nbsp; I could happily live making quilts and doing farm chores.&nbsp; But that was hard work too.&nbsp; A good friend, who was 92, would always say "It was a good life...but it was a hard life."&nbsp;   I suppose the time I was meant to&nbsp;live in is now, and I've got to make the most of it.&nbsp; But I will go camping&nbsp;to get a taste for&nbsp;simple times.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything it's to keep my survival instincts from getting too rusty.&nbsp;

      I always enjoyed it when the clock on my microwave displayed a number that was palindromic, that is, a number that reads the same forwards and backwards e.g. 8:09:08.&nbsp; This phenomenon can also be demostrated with letters.&nbsp; "Madam, I'm Adam" is perhaps the most famous palindrome.&nbsp; Whole word palindromes can also be created, such as: "So patient a doctor to doctor a patient so".&nbsp; What I have for you here are a few of my favorite palindromes.&nbsp; What's that, you say you don't like palindromes?&nbsp; Draw, o coward!

       Yes I will confess, I do go about reading random blogs.&nbsp; I look at the list of recently published blogs and pick the ones with names that interest me.&nbsp; Which makes me wonder if my own blog's name is a bit too plain to attract random blog readers.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I will also confess that I like to leave one liner comments on other people's blogs too.&nbsp; Maybe then some random fellow blogger will stop by for a visit.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If I'd have known how addicted I'd become to blogging I wonder if I would have started in the first place?&nbsp;

      I have to say that I think I believe in the powers of  urlLink feng shui .  I'm not into extremes when it comes to feng shui but I believe that a clutter free room leads to more energy and happiness.    I'm the sort of person who can't sit at a messy desk in a messy room and do any sort of productive work.  I need my surroundings to be peaceful and bright and conducive to getting work done.  That's not to say that I like to work in a room with no stimulation.  I often have some good classic rock station on the radio and enjoy occasionally looking at various pictures and things in my room when I need a break.    Sometimes my goldfish are all I need to get re-energized.  I have two dearly loved goldfish, Berkley and Shimano.  One is a black moor and the other a gold fantail.  I suppose you could say that they are some sort of eye candy.  But to me they are a bit more.  They show me the simplicity of life.  To them I am their god. I feed them, change the water and even talk to them occasionally.  In Feng Shui  urlLink fish and water  can mean all sorts of things.  But what if they go  urlLink belly up  on you does that mean bad luck?  I think goldfish are wonderful creatures and sometimes a fish is just a fish.    Anyway I'm feeling a lot of positive energy today.  I think I'll keep it up by de-cluttering something...

      Today a man came to the door.  He was an inspector of some sort.  I should have paid more attention to this part but the dog was barking non-stop as I was trying to have a conversation.  Anyway he said he was doing property surveys of some sort and proceeded to ask me a few questions about my house.  How many bedrooms, was there any other buildings on the property, did we still have 7 foot ceilings in the basement etc.  I was quite surprised that he knew some of this information already.  He said that previous surveys had been done and that's how he knew.  Anyway he didn't come inside (thank goodness because my room is a mess) but he walked around the house once.    It just gave me the eerie feeling that my life isn't really all that private after all.  People know the exact layout of my house.  Do they need to know that my bedroom walls are pink too?

      Well I've succesfully 'won' an Atari 2600 system from e-bay.  After watching about a dozen auctions and bidding on a few I jumped at the chance to 'buy it now' for a reasonable price.  If all goes well in the land of e-bay, in a few weeks I should have a working atari system with power adaptor, hook ups, and 16 games (all new ones to me).   I'm overjoyed at this purchase and I just hope everything works out well.  This is the first time I've used my credit card on the internet through paypal.  I feel empowered but also a bit nervous.  But I've bought two laptops on e-bay before and everything worked out so I guess I have faith in fellow e-bayers.  I'm just itching to play pac-man for hours on end!

      The US and Canadian standard railroad gauge - the distance between the rails - is 4 feet, 8.5 inches.  Why that exceedingly odd number? Because that is the way they built them in England, and the North American railroads were built by English expatriates.  Why did the English people build them like that?  Because the first rail lines were built by the same people who built the  pre-railroad tramways, and that is the gauge they used.    Why?  Because the people who built the tramways used the same jigs and tools for building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.  OK!  Why, then, did the wagons use that odd spacing?  Well, if they tried to use any other spacing, the wagons would break on some of the old long-distance roads, because that was the spacing of the old wheel ruts.  So, who built the old rutted roads?  The 1st long-distance roads in Europe were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of its legions and have been used ever since.  The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots, which, because they were made for or by Imperial Rome, were all alike in wheel spacing.  So, the Canadian standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original specifications for an Imperial Rome army war chariot.  Specs and bureaucracies live forever.

      It'a a rare thing for me to get mail these days.  So it was very surprising when three pieces came all together.    Letter #1 GST cheque My reaction: Wahoo!  I feel like I have a million dollars now!  Letter #2 Results from the College of Nurses of Ontario I've passed my RN exam! My reaction:  Double Wahoo!  But I still have to fork out another $175 to get my licence to practice.  Only one more hoop to jump through now!    Letter #3 My visa bill  Reaction:  Boohoo! Well at least my balance is coming down a bit.  Good thing I've still got some room so I can pay for my licensing fees!  Sort of a catch 22 situation.  You can't work until you've paid for all these things (exam, license, 4 year university degree).  But you can't do all those things without working to make money...oh well.  I'm on my way up anyhow.    Anyways I like to get mail, especially the fun kind, so send me a postcard anytime!

      Lady's-Slippers are quite precious things indeed. A flower comes after patiently waiting a decade, Yet fades within a week. Ah but my camera's eye will catch such beauty,  And the flower will be everlasting. So delicate and pink and perfectly named, Created with such imagination!   - Amanda June 26, 04   While at my camp I wanted to capture the beauty of the many clusters of lady's-slippers that were in full bloom.  I took about a dozen pictures.  What I didn't know was that the film was black and white.  I had wanted to capture the bright colours of the flowers.  It turned out that the black and white pictures are great anyway.  If I had a scanner I'd happily share them with everyone!

      I'm the type of person that likes to make lists of things to do and then gratifyingly cross of items as I accomplish them.  I've used this strategy while in university to get me through all those assignments.  There's just something about having things written down in a sort of organized way that motivates me to get things done.  Anyway I'd like to share my to do list for today with you.  To Do List - July 6, 04 - clean room - unpack bags from weekend - do laundry - finish book I was reading - work on resume - do some writing - take dog for walk - change water in fish bowl - write a blog - return something to store - go to town council meeting @7 re: Vallee Park - write e-mails to friends  Looking back at my day I can say that I've accomplished most of these things.  I didn't read my book, work on my resume, or write anything (other than this blog).  I think I did manage to do most things because they were achievable and left room for some flexibility.  I did do a few extra things like make macaroni salad and have a visit with an old friend.   The list help me to stay focused though and not waste time watching reruns of tv shows.  I didn't work on my resume probably because it means I have to get serious about getting a job and I'm still in vacation mode.  Reading and writing just weren't priorities today I guess.  There is always tomorrow I guess.    Well I guess I'm just the sort of person that likes to make lists.  I have sort of made a list of lifetime to do's.  I still have to rethink it a bit and make sure everything is actually achievable.  I'll give you a hint: someday I'm going to be a ski instructor!

      Well I'm still looking for that long lost vintage Atari 2600 game system.  Currently my old one is in about a dozen pieces as my dad and I attempted to perform surgery but failed.  I've scouted out garage sales only to find a sega system with games for $20 - it's just not the same though.  I've been to value village and had no luck there either.  I think the best thing to do is place bids on e-bay.  I've been watching a few auctions and the price seems to be in the $40-$60 range and then $20 shipping.  I think it's worth it.  It would be a whole lot more expensive to go and buy a new videogame system these days.  I just can't wait to play those old games again!

      So my dear friend is happily married.  Everything went relatively smoothly with a few bumps but she's done it.  We had a wonderful time getting all dressed up, taking tons of pictures, meeting relatives, and enjoying a night of dinner and dancing.    As I was participating in all of the prewedding and wedding events I began to really wonder what purpose the wedding serves and then what purpose marriage has.  I'll start with weddings.  I guess that weddings give people a chance to publicly proclaim their love and commitment to eachother.  Also weddings are a time where two families come together and welcome the bride or groom into the family.  And it's a good excuse for a party where long lost relatives can come and be reunited.  These things are all wonderful, but it sort of takes the focus away from the bride and groom and just on to having a good time.    Then there is always the possibility of eloping.  I think this is much more romantic, however it comes at the cost of not including friends and family.  But you could always include them later in a big party or something.  I'm still debating this one.  Personally I'd like to have a wedding celebration some day but at the same time I know the stress and anxiety involved and I have to wonder if it's worth it.    Okay so on to marriage.  Hmm.. I'm not even sure where to begin.  I guess I'll just say that I've always been curious to know what exactly they council people about in premarital councilling.  Do they go through all the vows and make sure that both partners actually understand them all and will do all the things they say they will.  Do they ask you if you think it's true love.  What if you want to change your mind after that?    My own personal thought on marriage is that it's a commitment to another person that you will be with them forever no matter what (unless someone breaks their vows) and you absolutely have to be in love - real true love.    Then the question becomes how do you know if you are in love.  Well I've decided to mentally make a list of all the things I think love is.  I started out with the basics:  Love is patient, love is kind, love is not selfish or keeps no record of wrongs etc.  And then added a few things that I personally think love is.  For example: love is being able to take care of a your partner when they are sick and need help on the bed pan after falling down on some icy stairs and breaking a tailbone.  I guess that fits into the sickness and health one...   My point is that a checklist of criteria for true love may just be a good idea to help you realize if your relationship is really meant to be or not.  And if you are ready to commit to being married. Sometimes I think that love is blind and people get married with their eyes wide shut.  Not me...I want the truth...I want true love.

       It never fails that however nonchalant I try to be while walking down the street with a sledgehammer I always get the attention of some guy in a pick-up truck. The first time the comment was "Is that your weapon?" And today it was "Is that big enough for you?" I just smile and keep walking. What's so strange about a 23 year old young lady walking down the road with a sledgehammer?

      As I sit here writing and sipping on my oversized cup of tea I wonder if I could survive on a tea and toast diet. I happen to really enjoy tea, and I love white bread with jam. I'd add a bit of peanut butter now and then for protein. Oh wait I've already tried this one, except it was only breakfast and the odd supper that I had tea and toast. At any rate I dream of having a cupboard just for tea, all different sorts. That way one could choose the kind they wanted according to however they felt that day. I also dream of futons...but that's another story...
