      It's been a while,, since I set him free... But I'm still longing for him.. The pain still remains and I can't still get over it.. Memories still runs thru my head. So many questions and if's.. Wondering if I could ever turn back time.. If I could,, maybe I won't feel this way. I remember I used to make a joke abt people who cry bcoz of love.. But now,, I guez the joke is on me.. Damn't,, now I know how they feel.. Love suddenly became a great ache!!  Those sad quotes and love songs made me kept me thinking.. How much I loved him and just a snap he asked me to set him free. Damn,, do you know how much that hurts?! I know I'm more than that. I wish that I would be someone that he loved.. Maybe,, if that happens I would be the happiest person on earth..... Is it better to be just friends?? Or more than friends though I know that its impossible.. Deep inside,, I'm a loner a person seeking for love. I still want him bak even for as a friend but maybe that wouldny work coz it would be difficult for both of us especially me coz thats not wut I feel for him.. I'm thankful though he taught me how to love.. Though that love didnt actually exist.. never was and never will be.. That love was never meant for us. Maybe for him and someone else but not for me.. Too bad,, if it was never meant for me.. Still thinking of the day when I saw you wit sumone else.. I felt anger,, and loneliness mixed inside my thoughts.. Though I know that I dont have the right..    Do ya'll know the song "Kung Ako Na Lang Sana" by Bituin Escalante?? Ya know wut.. everytime I hear that song it always remind me of him. Coz I can relate to it.. Coz what if I'm the one he loved.. Maybe,, everyone would be happy right.. And maybe I'm not writing this now!! I guez,, this message is just sumting to calm me and to put all my thoughts.. Actually,, this is how it all started in infatuation and ended as love.. I know sumday,, I'll have the guts to step further and put my past behind me. But now,, I still dont know wut to do. I'm so stuck on him.. There's so many lessons to learn and so many roads to turn.. I don't feel right when youre gone!! I don't feel right when youre here either.. Coz I know that I dont have the right to have you here. Memories is all I got.. We became friends actually,, very good friends.. Too bad,, we never became more than friends.. I'm just a friend right??  I know that sum of ya'll cannot relate.. Coz sum of you maybe happy wit their partners right now.. But I know sum can relate to me,, right?? Its very difficult to forget sumone you really really loved!! Sumone who made you laugh and made you cry!! I can just think of tis as a bad experience.. Like a bad day..   I know the joke is on me,, but still I cant understand why life is so unfair!! I know,, there's sumone out there whose more pathetic than me. Probably,, sumone out there is the right one for me.. Waiting?/ I guez not!! Coz it would be really munch better if he was the one!! The one for me... I guez,, I juz have to accept the fact that you're never meant for me.. and I'm never meant for you.. I dunno why I cant move on.. Sumhow,, I still love you after all this SHIT!! That he did to me.. I cant understand why?? Can you tell me why?? I guez no one can actually answer me!! Coz no one really knows.. I juz have to get the answer deep insyd me.. May sound so cliche and cynical but its true!! I know,, I sound so helpless but I accept that coz its true!! I can accept simple things like that.. But I cant accept that you would never ever fall for me.. You just see me as a friend!! But I dont..
