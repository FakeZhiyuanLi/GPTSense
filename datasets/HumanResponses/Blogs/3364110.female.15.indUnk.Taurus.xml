      Heya all! I'm really happy. I may be beginning to get a bit of a cold, which is lame, and I hope it goes away before Friday, but I'm happy, cause I love Pete, and I've done 2/3 of my history coursework, and I'm gonna do some english revision later, but for now I'm free and happy, and I'm a little bit tired, but I'm wonderful. Isn't it great when you're with someone, and all you can think about is them, and you love them so much you can't describe it, and you want to spend the rest of your life with them? Yeah, it is.  Pete's coming round on Friday to revise with me and Jess, yay!

      At the balloon festival today, every minute I wasn't almost on the rides I was thinking about you. I can't put into words what I feel for you, I love you so much. This is so different to what I've felt in the past. I just get so overwhelmed by my feelings for you whenever I think about you, I just... Want to be with you forever. I love you.

      I feel so happy. I stayed up for a while texting Pete last night, and at about 12.20 I said nanight and turned off my phone. I woke up this morning to find my KORG brochures had arrived, wooyay, and I turned on my phone, texted Pete, only to discover he'd texted me twice since I'd turned my phone off. He's texted to say "I can't stop thinking about you, is this normal?" and "I love you Sarah".  ...  *beams with happiness* I love him...  We get on so well, and he's just perfect... *sighs dreamily*

      I have a glass of orange juice. I haven't drank orange juice for about a year, how sad. I love orange juice. Well, I don't LOVE it, but I can bear it and it's healthy. Delicious and nutritious, some would say.  I wanna buy a CD this weekend... I have enough money to get two. Yay. I may just treat myself!

      Wheee. I'm tired, I'm bored. I'm transcribing and improving my minimalist piece, just like Mr Wood said. Later I'll find out scales in 3rds and 6ths and 10ths like Debbie and Nick said. Afterwards I may even do some electronics. Or I could leave the minimalism, seeing as that won't take too long at all, and I could quickly get 3rds, 6ths and 10ths done, and then work on my electronics. That sounds reasonable to me.

They all think I'm a freak. *sob sob*  I have my cool ring watch on today, y'know, the blue one with the blue spike? :D I need to find my big slayer earrings... *mwahahahahaha*  I'm becoming so inane, darn it.

      God, I'm so bored. Once again I sit here in the electronics IT room and blog.  Yeah, thank you to Nick for that last night though, and also thank you to Patrick - The first person in three years to save me a seat. *big hugs for Nick and Patrick*  Oh dear, here comes Mr Wakefield (a.k.a. the Big Bad B*stard).  Ah well, he's gone now.  I sit here and do this so often... My blog is so fricking pointless. I don't write anything of interest on here...  Oh, I did manage not to harass *someone* last night. He didn't text me or phone me or anything and he wasn't online, so I left it at that. Hi James. *waves* Yeah, his parents may hate me... Apparently beforehand his parents had said "not too much fraternising with the exams coming up". So hm. :-S

      Yum.  Sarah (If you find me offensive, f*ck off.) says: Ooh I have some presents for you tomorrow Sarah (If you find me offensive, f*ck off.) says: Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (you listened today and liked) and Metropolis Part Two by Dream Theater, and The Odyssey by Symphony X Sarah (If you find me offensive, f*ck off.) says: And thank you for spending your lunchtime listening to me whine({) Nick "I'm quite flattered that you think I'm cute, But I don't deal well with compacted poop" says: that's quite ok, I'd do it a hundred times over if I thought it could help you  That's kinda made me go all fluffy and nice inside. It's nice to find somebody who's sweet like that, who cares and isn't afraid to show it. Thanks Nick. :-) Makes a change to be told that, I feel all special now. (^_^)

      Bastards, aren't they. They pick on everything you do, complain when you do what they ask, compain when you don't, become crazy and possessed by an all-consming jealousy, fuck you about, tell you they love you then change their mind, completely fuck you up, then strangle with your own hair and have you "preserved" in a fricking portrait.  Well, no.  But men are generally bastards. There being... *counts*... 5, no more than 10, exceptions to this rule that I know about.  Rant over.

      Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Dance of Eternity!!!! Approx 1 minute til ragtime solo... My nan's thinking of upgrading my keyboard after the holiday, woo! I'm quite tempted to have a look around at some Korgs, everybody rates them well. Although the ultimate keyboard would be the K2600X by Kurzweil... *cries at amazingness of keyboard* I want that keyboard damnit! Oh, apparently, Tim and Zak both have that keyboard! How ironic that they're sitting there readin my blog as I type... *rolls eyes*  But yeah, anyway. K2600X... *drools* So fucking lush!!!!!!!! Seriously, Pitch whell, mod wheel AND a pitch pad!!!!!!!!!!!! I want that freaking keyboard. Jordan Rudess uses it... And he's a completely amazing bastard. *curses for Jordan being so fucking amazing* Wow... Ragtime solo. I guarantee that within a year I'll be able to play it. Dance of Eternity is generally amazing though...  Wheeee, changed tracks now. Blue by A Perfect Circle. Must find lyrics for that... I'm becoming quite partial to them, big thanks to Nick for lending me the CD, bigger thanks to Shez for remembering to bring it in to give to Nick. :D

      Wow, so, a new blogger account. I'm not giving the url of this to anyone though. 'Cause I want a way to vent everything. And the unkown blog url is always a good choice.  So tired and bored... I've done nothing remotely to do with electronics this lesson, I don't know why I bother turning up anymore. *shrugs*  I'm tired and confused. I mean, I know Nick doesn't "like" me, but that's okay, i don't mind. He's still hot though. But *someone else*'s been flirting a LOT lately, and I'm confused, because I don't know if I "like" him or not. Because I mean he's attractive, he's a lovely guy, and if he asked me out I would say yes, but does that actually mean I fancy him? :S And I don't know if he "likes" me either, because he's as confused as I am. :S

I am a woman of substance, independant not codependant.  Right, now that's out of the way.  I'm going on holiday to Brixham tomorrow, so there won't be any bloggage for at least a week. Yay!  Okay, so I broke up with Pete. I'm fine with that. I had a very long cry on Wednesday night and a long cry to Becca yesterday lunchtime, but Jess and Yasmin and Becca and everybody was there for me, and I feel a lot better, knowing I have so many wonderful caring friends there for me.  And Lucy's older sister Jenny (who I speak to on the rareish occasions when i'm in the LSCR) is going out with Ash, A.K.A. Hot Guy! Noooooooo!  Um, what else to say...  England lost the football last night, *prepares self for hoards of angry fans beating her* HOORAY!!!!!  Um...  I'm fine, I'm getting on with life, I'm surviving. I'm still upset about it but I'm not letting it bother me anymore. I'm okay. If I could put emoticons on this blog I'd do the quaver and sing "I will survive" by Gloria Gaynor.

      So I told Matt about breaking up with Pete and he said, "You really ARE working your way through those guys aren't you?" So I got upset and pulled his hair, harder than I meant to, and now I feel guilty and bad and horrible. I'm a b*tch. Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah somebody shoot me. I was okay this morning, now I just feel lame and unloved and horrible and cr*ppy. Why does nobody care anymore? The people that do care, I can barely speak to at the moment, because I feel lame and sh*tty and selfish. I want to go and curl up in a hole and die.

      Sarah    says: pete, answer me one question though Sarah    says: are you in this relationship because you want me, or just for the sake of a relatonship? Peter Blencowe-We should keep our cultural identity. my *rse -you shouldn't have came here if you wanted that. When in Rome... says: i dont know  That is the best possible thing that could have happened to me two nights before my holiday. I'm going to be able to go on my holiday so relaxed now. And I get to come back in the knowledge that he'll be in Paris, so I can't talk to him! Oh yes, I'm so chuffed. I'm going to go into school and go the whole day without breaking down once. Oh yes, I'll manage to get downstairs without breaking down and my nan asking all sorts of questions. Oh yes.

Lalala, also watched HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban, although towards the end it kept jumping, so I stopped it and I haven't seen the end, so I think on holiday I may treat myself to the first two anyway, and may possibly do something legal and go and see the third in the cinema with someone when  get back! Shock horror, me being all legal and law-abiding! :O!  Lalalala... I wanna see all the HP movies now, getting all into them again and remembering how great they are. Shame I gave my HP books to Ann, twas silly of me - I want them back now! *sobsob*

      We have to pick three pieces that are for our instrument and linked by techniques used, style and genre, perform one of them (30 marks) and evaluate the performance (10 marks), analyse them and develop a composition brief for a piece in that style/genre/using those techniques (10 marks), create a composition from the brief (30 marks) and write an appraisal evaluating the composition (10 marks). I'm torn whether to do piano as my instrument and for my three pieces do Les Trois Gymnopédies by Erik Satie, because that'd be really easy, but then I'd have to compose a disco piece to replace my waltz that I've already handed in, OR I could use keyboard as my instrument, analyse Metropolis Part Two the album and Six Degrees of nner Turbulence the album by Dream Theater and Snow the album by Spock's Beard, because they're all one piece technically as they're concept albums, and perform the overture for Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence as my performance, and the composition would be easy as I have loads of Dream Theater style riffs I've already written.  Yeah, I'll use my keyboard. I'll have my new one by the time the project's due to finish, so I can do my performance last when I have my new keyboard. YAY!

      Yeah, okay, so I'm not the using the computer for constructive purposes. Well, I AM, I'm copying the VAST CD that Nick's just given me to borrow. I'm listening to it aswell, so if I bring in a blank CD tomorrow I can just copy it, and give it to him back in like 10 minutes or so.  Okay, so. Bored, tired, a little hungry. Watched "The Truth about Cats and Dogs" last night, very good. Lalala. Right, okay, constructiveness so I don't get kicked out - OOOOH I could print off the music for certain DT songs, if the bl**dy printer would work.

      I had a panic attack before my French writing exam. I've never had one before, it frightened the shit out of me. I was crying, speaking really quickly and quietly to myself, I couldn't breathe and my head was spinning. It was scary... I calmed down in the end, but I had to do the exam in Mr Beal's office because I'd missed the start of it. Turns out it wasn't actually all that hard anyway. Left me feeling like a prize prat.  I feel a bit better now, actually. I went to find Nick to talk but he had an exam aswell, so I stood there in the common room getting hugged briefly then standing in the corridor feeling sh*tty.  My computer is still laming up and I can't play TRC. F#cking thing.

      Okay, here's my non-posted lot for the day.  I'm full of doubt about everything. About my exams, about my future, about Pete... I don't know. I love him so much, but it would seem that he only said yes when I asked him out because he'd never had anybody ask him out before. I mean, he sent me all those sweet texts, and emails, and said he loves me, but when I asked him what he loved about me, all he could reply was "the fact I seem to love him so much." Is that really a basis for a relationship? I don't know. I'd love to spend all my time with him, because I love him, and I can see this lasting, but if that's all he loves about me... I mean, he said he's not terribly physically attracted to me, which is kind of a downer, because I was really hoping that this relationship would be different in that respect, PLUS he's called me podgy, which was for a reason, and I did ask why I'd get the p*ss ripped out of me if I went to one of his cricket matches. I'm still with him because I want to be, but I don't know if he wants to be. I'm just confused, I mean, is he just saying he loves me or does he actually love me and want to be with me for a long time?  And then there's still the whole thing with my mum. I would love to just ignore it and get on with my life, but I can't. I miss her, and although I don't want direct contact with her in a serious "you're back in my life you're my mum again" kind of way, I would like to know how she is. I can't forget what she did and how she treated me, but in a way I've forgiven her. I mean, I must have forgiven her if I can say I don't care about what she did anymore. I... say that, but I don't know if that's true either. It may just be the fact that I wish I had someone to call mum or dad. I spoke to Malcolm about it a while ago, and I explained to him that he and Penny have been like a mum and dad to me, but he got really *rsey almost, about how he and Penny could never replace my parents. I just want to find somewhere stable, secure. I mean, I'm secure with my grandparents, butit's not the ideal situation. I'll be honest I'm not exactly happy with the way things are. Granted, I have a lot more freedom and such, but... I appreciate everything they've done for me, and they've always been there for me, but we're not getting on brilliantly at the moment. My grandad is just plain annoying. He's constantly asking me about stuff he knows I don't care about, he's always jumping on me when I'm doing something else. I get in from school and he comes straight up and says "How was your day? What happened? How's everything? Are yous ure you're okay?" And I know it's only because he cares, but it's annoying. When I get in from school I automatically go into "absent-minded not-caring tired stressed b*tch" mode, and he wonders why I bite his head off. I'm just really tired of it. I just want to be alone...  In the maths exam, with the compasses I didn't need, I was sitting there after finishing, contemplating picking a hole in my arm. I realised that'd be stupid, because it'd gain unwanted attention. But I'm home alone tonight, and I've found my grandad's brand new penknife, so I might cut. Just a little bit, to ease everything up. I want to and I feel like I need to. I've managed not to so far, and I'm just hoping I can last the week without it. I won't be able to all next week because I'm on holiday, which is about the only thing I'm looking forward to. I can't look forward to the stuff I'd planned with Pete anymore because I don't know if it's going to happen because I'm full of doubt. All I know is I love him with all my heart and I want to stay with him for the forseeable future. I love you if you're reading this, please put my mind at rest.

      Wow, how did you all guess I'm sitting next to Sam in IT.  Lamey lame lame Maths exam which I did badly on. I got over half marks, I'm confident of that much, but how MUCH over half marks, God knows.  French Writing revision next, then the exam itself. *screams and cries and runs away madly*  I never have anything of real use to blog, do I? Hm. Oh, I did get a protractor and pair of compasses from the physics department, which made me late for the exam, and then it turns out I didn't need them. Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasturds. Absurdness. Ballsy lame cliche fools.  And no Sam I don't want to marry you OR make you cake. OR jelly. OR scones. OR ANYTHING.  NO SARAH CLONES, THERE'S ENOUGH OF ME ALREADY:'(

      So yeah, got home last night, felt like cr*p. Had food, walked around some shoe shops, found a lush pair of shoes that I liked AND were ideal for wearing with skirts at school. Nan wouldn't let me get them. Despite her having said they were nice. So I went and had some food. Then I played on the computer with my cousin. I caught a red bus home. That made me hyper for a little while, but it was all very short-lived. I went on my keyboard and said to my nan I'm going to practise every night this week to chill me out. Ergo (by her logic) I'm not allowed online this week. B!tch.  And this morning I have a maths exam which I've barely revised for, this afternoon I have a French GCSE which I have done no revision whatsoever for. Great. And I feel tired, and Pete hasn't emailed me, and I miss him and I wonder if he's okay.  On the bus to school this morning, when it stopped at the train station, if I had some money I would've got off and bought a ticket to somewhere. F#ck knows where, I just want to be alone and left to my own devices.

      I didn't call you fat, you freaking well know it. I hate you, why can't you just give over and leave me the hell alone. I'm not trying to split you and him up, I'm not you, you know. I'm not the one who gets all possessive over friends, "oh he was my friend first, you've stolen him," even when I barely know these freaking people. Oh just go and die already.  Hope I'm home alone tonight.

Now I feel like a sl#t. Which I'm not. Okay? I'm not a sl#t.  I'm tired and stressed and I'm sitting here sobbingmy freaking heart out to a computer. Oh, and Amy's next door, but she's probably not really all that bothered. I mean who'd want to bother with a sl#t like me.

      Ah f#ck it, I might as well post. I nearly cut again just now. I don't know why, I'm perfectly content, I just felt the need to cut. I'm happy as I can be, I'm happy with Pete, I'm happy at school, my exams kicked off to a good start today, I don't know why. I just almost did.

      Blogging one-handed as I dry my hair. It's in curlers, it's *crosses fingers* hopefully going to look pretty. :-)  Nick's coming in on Wednesday, as is Lizza, YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have nothing of real importance to blog about.  Oh, wait, I do.  I never, ever thought I'd say this, but I'm starting to miss my mum. I'm past caring about what she did now, it's like it never happened. In a way I suppose I've forgiven her. But I do miss her. I just wish I knew how she is, how well she's doing. I... don't want to miss her, but I do. And I can't tell my grandparents, because then they'll be upset that I've lied to them about it. Again. And I don't WANT to see her or contact her, because it'd give her the last laugh AND the upper hand. I'm confused...

I was feeling all self-pitying *ashamed* because pete phoned to say Buzzy couldn't make it tomorrow, and he'd rather revise on his own anyway so he's not coming, so I went into Ottakars and bought myself a cutesy Miffy wallet! It's white with silver and blue patterns and Miffy's name written in Japanese and a picture of Miffy both drawn in fluorescent red!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YAY MIFFY!!!  I'm getting the matching bag in a couple of weeks. (^_^)  Quite (well, understatement...) disappointed Pete can't come tomorrow, was reeeeeeeeally looking forward to spending some time with him, even if it was only to revise. :-(  Ah well, I'm sure I'll survive. I'll just have to send him his presents by post. :-P

      Having a discussion with Freeman about what sort of things I can do o to help lose more weight. I know what I can do, and what I am doing.  I'm having a night to myself tonight, I've been helping nan tidy the bathroom, the spare room and my room today, AND I've been finishing off the huge great picture of Ariel I started yesterday. It looks lush, I'll get a pic later.

      Right, mini-update.  I finished my chemistry coursework ages ago, and I'm only just emailing it in. Balls.  Um...  I've lost 3lbs... XD I never thought I'd resort to that ridiculous face but it's the only thing that can show my happiness.  It's my cousin Emma's disco on Saturday, funky. So, in repayment for all the Disney drawings that my uncle did for my birthdays when I was little, I'm drawing (and photocopying... *hangs head* I'm a bad artist) many pictures of all the Disney princesses (Aurora [Sleeping Beauty for those of you who're thick], Belle [Beauty and the Beast], Ariel [The Little Mermaid], Cinderella [...] and Snow White [...]) 'cause she has them on the border on her bedroom wall, and she wuvs them, so I'm drawing them all so I can stick them on the windows for her disco.  Also on Saturday, it's my last keyboard lesson this term, so I'm gonna buy myself some of the feathered angel wings (black if they have them, white if not) and wear them around town 'cause Jessi's coming over to help me do face painting at Emma's birthday. Then the weekend after that I'm getting Nightwish's new album Once (LE) from Martian Records PLUS A FREE NIGHTWISH PROMO POSTER EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Then the week after that I'll have had half my money to get the aforementioned items and the other half goes towards my phone bill.  Tea's out, seeya.

Poor little thing believe mes. :-( I should really stop this soon. And I did, and she's killing me :'-( I'm sorry Jess, I'm an evil horrible cow and you have every right to hate me :'-( Well no, it was only a joke, but I know I was wrong, I'm sorry :'-(

      So first I got reeeeeeally pset about Jessi ignoring me and overreacted, thinking "oh my god she's never gonna talk to me again" and cut. Then we made up, and she went to phone childline about stuff. Now I've just cut again, fuck knows why. Now the computer's screwing up.  Fuck off. I may phone childline later.  And don't start complaining at me cause you think my problems are petty. There's a lot more going on in my brian you don't freaking know about, there's a lot that even Jess doesn't know about. And anyway, childline is there for a freaking reason, isn't it?

      I owe Pete an apology. I was totally pissed last night, and the whole thing with the rat up the arse just opened up an opportunity to show off a (mildly) witty comeback. I very rarely get that opportunity cause I ain't that clever, I is a bit slow. So Pete, when you read this I apologise profusely, I didn't mean (much of) it, and I wuvoo really. Wuv, not love. You taught me a lesson about doing that. But never mind, it's past, I've forgotten it, hopefully as you'll forget this.  Anyway, on a much lighter note, i'm on level three on TR2!!! I managed to complete two whole levels!  ...  Okay...  So I used the guide to tell me exacty what to do. Gah, people.

      Oh yes. So I texted Pete, asking how he was. "Good ta, you? Going to see round the world in 80 days tomorrow, followed by pizza." "I'm great. Jess came over today, James' birthday on Thursday, Friday night I'm playing a minigig at the snooker presentation night. Busy bee me." "Cool, what you playing? P.S. You still gonna have that pic I did of you?" "Dunno yet, sorting it out tomorrow with my uncle. I don't mind about the pic, not fussed to be honest." "I you give me your addy I can send it to ya;)" "Nah, it doesn't matter Pete. Don't make a fuss over it. :P" "Hey, I've already done the pic so it would be a waste wouldn't it?" "Do what you want, I ain't fussed. I you like it that much stick it on yer fridge :P" "I want to send it to you so it would be in your best interests to give me your addy, ya?" "Send it to Timbuctoo, I don't care. You didn't want my postcard, I don't want your pic. :P I know what I look like thanks." "What rat got stuck up your arse?" "You did." *cue rapturous applause and laughter* "Okay. I think you must be on drugs or something so I'm going to sleep now so goodnight." "Nah, I'm just about to crack open a bottle of wine and propose a toast to all the fuckers in the world - like you. Anyway, here's to my prosperous future, you fuckwit."

      Okay, I'm having a shitty time. I want to cut. But I don't want to be that weak. There are people far worse off than me. And&nbsp; need to stay strong, not just for me and my family, but for the people who need me, like *nameless*. I need to stay strong so&nbsp;I can be there for her, cause if I'm in a state, who's she gonna turn to? I'm over-tired and over-emotional, and I'm regressing, again, and I hate myself for it, and I'm on the verge of tears typing this but my nan's downstairs and if I cry she's gonna ask so many questions, and I can't face that. I'm gonna break down, I can't cope with this. Just I wish I had somebody to talk to. I wanna phone childline, that's a good idea. whenever it is that I'm home alone next I'm phoning childline. &nbsp; I was gonna do some exercises tonight. Shit. I ain't gonna lose any weight this way, am I. *cries long and hard, wishing for a shoulder*

I can play a lot of Home by Dream Theater now, and I'm much closer to having finished my music coursework. I'm doing chemistry coursework tomorrow. Go me! Also tomorrow night getting exercise video out (don't laugh you evil bastards) to help lose weight. I had my last ever McDonalds today. I'm glad. It wasn't pleasant. The stupid French girl got our order wrong like three times and then she couldn't make the till work. &nbsp; Marcus is lame, he lost :D

      I feel all confused. I was just really definitely getting over Pete and starting to think hey, sh*t happens, when I spend an hour on the phone to him after weeks of not talking. I'm confused. :'( &nbsp; I'm also worried about Nick. He said his mood's been up and down lately, and I think he's on a downer at the moment, cause he's being all "yeah. okay. mhm." And I know it's selfish, but although I am worried about him, it is making me upset, cause I just feel like an annoying little year 10. Which next year it'll be annoying little year 11. But I'll still be annoying and naggy, and I feel bad about it, cause I don't wanna be annoying, I just wanna be friendly, and I know I have a tendency to be a bit hyper, or a bit depressed, to the extreme, but that's just me, I can't really do that much about that. I was gonna go see the people at the FPC tomorrow, but can't now, cause I can't get out. So I have to wait to do that. And argh, it's the end of year 10, I should be happy, but I'm not, cause of silly little things which shouldn't bug me but do. *cries*

      She still holds a grudge against Pete for being horrible when we broke up. And now I've said that me, Buzz and Pete can meet up to play tennis in the summer, I was gonna go back to the club with them to play pool, but nan has said that because of what happened Pete's not welcome at the club, and even if he did go there she'd probably have a go at him. Which I'm really upset about.

      KITTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Yes, that's right, a goth kitten.  :D  I weighed myself today. I weigh far too much. Over summer I'm going to eat less fatty foods, limiting myself to one chocolate bar (not mars, probably a kitkat or small bag of malteasers) per month (may seem extreme but meh, less chocolate is good), taking packed lunches to school, not having so much sugar in tea and on cereal, walking places instead of taking the bus, walking the dogs religiously every weekend with my nan, doing more general exercise for fun, too. I mean, I enjoy basketball, volleyball, badminton, tennis and swimming, so I'm gonna start going swimming with my friends a bit, playing tennis once a week with my uncle/cousin/somebody, I play basketball at home anyway, I could even walk down to the park and play there, my aunt plays badminton so I could play with her, volleyball I could join the school team next term. It seems logical to me. Also, I'm going to eat more salady stuff with food, I barely ever eat salad, that's healthy, so I should eat more salad. *nods* I'm gonna lose at least two stone, preferably more. And I'm hoping I should be able to do it by the end of the Christmas term, realistically. Which means NEW CLOTHES FOR CHRISTMAS! :D Joking, joking.  Anyway, yeah. Not much has happened to be honest... We finally managed to record Voices yesterday.  I've just dried my hair, and it looks all pretty! I'm discussing my eating habits with Marcus and feeling ashamed. I need to eat a bit less. Well, not less, I don't eat THAT much, but what I do eat is usually quite fatty/greasy/sugary/all three. Marcus says not to mess with my diet too much otherwise my metabolism's gonna screw up, and if large figures run in my family (which they do) to be proud of it. But I'm not proud of it, I don't wanna end up like my mum - turning 40, fat and unable to lose weight, single mum and the only guy who'll have me tears me away from my family. I want to be a relatively pretty, successful girl with a lot to live for, and if I hae to work for that then so be it. I wanna show all those people who've deliberately insulted me about my weight and my looks that I CAN be pretty, and I AM pretty, maybe it's just not totally visible yet.

      Just to clarify this: I'm not "in love" with anybody, I don't "fancy" anybody, I'm single and half liking it. There are guys I think are hot, and there are guys I have a crush on (to have a crush on someone is not the same as to fancy them - to have a crush on someone is to drool over them when they're not looking, to fancy someone is to actually want to go out with them). So I get lonely, we all do. I'm coping. I don't particularly enjoy being single, but I can bear it.

      How people think they can get you the most impossible things? I mean, there's this thing I knew (which it turns out was wrong anyway) and he really wanted to know, and I said "there's one thing I want, if you can get it I'll tell you, but you can't get it, so I won't tell you." And I told him what it was, and he has this crazy idea he can get it for me. He says he can "wangle things". Pfft, not this thing.

      Yeah, clever of me. I clicked save, went to get food, came back and found the file had gone. A few hours later I realised that it was all a big computery mess and it had been hidden as a .tmp file. Phew.  Also, my Harry Potter DVD still won't work, so next weekend Jess is coming for a sleepeover, during which time I will go and see GP person, and we shall go and see HP+tPoA at the cinema. Hooray!  Buzzy can't make it tomorrow. I panicked, then he said he'd come on Tuesday. I was relieved.  Charity Day on Thursday, woo! Got all my gear sorted out, including... Beautiful new silver and amethyst ring my nan bought me! Hoorah! It's so purdy... *drools at beautiful ring*  Dying tips of hair blue on Saturday night, hopefully.

      Meh. I want to rant a lot, but it's pointless, because I'd get more annoyed and people'd get annoyed with me. Blargh...  Oh, I found anotherone of the charity quiz things - 6 - S on AF was 6 Stars on the Australian Flag. :-)  I wanted to go to the music department, but when I got there I thought what's the point. Playing piano or keyboard doesn't really do that much for me anymore. Despite the fact that it's the only thing I could be really good at if I tried.  Everybody at home says that if I put my mind to stuff I can do it, but that's not true. I'm too lazy to do stuff. I feel like I've lost myself, I don't actually know who I am. I mean, before, I just didn't know who I wanted to be. Now, I can't realise who I am, where I am in life. I'm so tired of feeling like this.  Right, b*llocksy depressed rant over. I seriously need to "go to Jess' house" next week.

He's nearly 10 years old).   26.  What's your job?  According to Jack, a "professional lunatic". I'd prefer... I don't know. Student? Whatever, who cares.  27.  Piercings?  Ears twice.  28.  Tattoos?  No.  29.  Obsessions?  I refuse to dignify this with an answer. Other than that already given, obviously. Oh, wait, I can safely say music.   30.  Addictions? Music again.   31.  Do you speak another language?  French.  32.  Have a favourite quote?  It varies, again, from day to day. If conversational ticks count, it's "meh".  33.  Do you have a webpage?

The Ups and Downs of Maria Del Mar Bonet.   42.  What's your biggest fear?  Spiders and other insecty/waspy/buggy things. I'm seriously petrified of flying ants, bad memories... Other than that, not much. I like fear mostly, fear is healthy.  43.  Can you sing?   Depends on what you call singing.   44.  Do you ever pretend to be someone else just to look cool?  No, not really.  45.  Are you a loner?   ...   46.  What are your No. 1 priorities in life?  I don't know anymore.  47.  If you were another person, would you be friends with you?  No, because I'm a moody, selfish, uncaring cow. As proved by that statement there.   48.  Are you a daredevil?  Not really. Although I did go on the megadrop tower at the balloon festival when my nan told me not to.  49.  Is there anything you fear or hate about yourself?  Way too much.  50.  Are you passive or agressive?  Both, a lot of the time.   51.  Do you have a journal?   Yes. It's called a diary, darn it.   52.  What is your greatest strength and weakness?   Strength - I have a "strong personality". Weakness - I exist.   53.  If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?  I'd be a different person. And I'd be pretty, in the materialistic, aesthetic-whore way.   54.  Do you think you are emotionally strong?  Sometimes. I manage to bottle a lot of stuff up, and when I talk about it I feel better, and I have great friends to support me. Thank you, you know who you are.

Don't know, probably Buzz because he plays drums.  136.  Do you trust others easily?  No. Although sometimes I trust others way too easily. I'm a walking contradiction, me.  137.  Who's house were you last at?   Mine, friends-wise, um... Jess', I think. Either Jess or Buzz, not sure.  138.  Name one person who's arms you feel safe in?  Once again, refusing to dignify these lamoid questions with even more lamoid answers other than that.  139.  Do your friends know you?  Some do, probably better than I know myself.   140.  Friend that lives farthest away?  Um... Buzzy, cause he lives in Gloucester. Actually, can I say the keyboardist Dave from the holiday camp? He's a cool guy, and despite the facts he's old enough to be my dad, he's still a friend. What? I've seen him twice in two years now. Grr. I'm not a freak. (i.i)  Love and all that:   141.

If someone you had no interest in had interest in dating you how would you feel?  Shocked. I'd probably die of shock.  147.  Do you prefer knowing someone before dating them?  Yes. My "track record" (as it has come to be known) would say otherwise, but yes.  148.  Have you ever wished it was more socially acceptable for a girl to ask a guy out?  It is, isn't it?  149.  Have you ever been romantically attracted to someone physically unattractive?  Yes. Nobody anybody else knows, because it's something I've kept to myself. And don't bother asking, because I'm not going to tell you.  150.  Do you think the opposite sex finds you good looking? No. I KNOW the opposite sex doesn't find me good looking.  151.  What is best about the opposite sex?  *thinking really hard* Nope, nothing. The male sex in general are lame, there are few exceptions to this.   152.  What is the worst thing about the opposite sex?  When they tell you they love you then change their mind afterwards. That's the worst thing ever. it's horrible. I should know, it's happened to me three times now. In a row.  153.  What's the last present someone gave you?  Um... *thinks* My nan and grandad bought me two CDs while we were on holiday.  154.

To make you cry?  Pete.  166.  To brighten up your day?  Becca.  167.  That you thought about?  Weetabix. What? With milk and sugar they're great. Thinking about that... Yum.  168.  You saw a movie with?  My grandparents. We watch a film every Saturday and Sunday night. Other than that, Adam.  169.  You talked to on the phone?   My grandad last night.   170.  You talked to through MSN?  Buzz.  171.  You saw?  Sam Webb (year 12 girl who gets my bus sometimes, she's cool).  Right this moment:   172.  What are you wearing right now?  A towel (I've just had a shower).  173.  Body part your touching right now?  None.  174.  What are you worried about right now?

      Sam: I'm not great, I'm human, humans are lame. To put it in perfectionate syllogistic logic:  Humans are lame. I am a human. Ergo (therefore (I know I'm a hypocrite and am being extremely patronising)) I am lame.  On other news...  P.E. teachers are sooooooooo horrible and patronising. "Well done!" "Good hit!" (the last two statements were to be read in an extremely patronising and sarcastic voice, as are the following.) "Are you listening?" "Well played!" "That was great!"  Why are people so sad?  Sam says Nigel is horrible. I like Sam. Therefore  I  say Nigel is horrible.  How bl**dy sad can you get.  Shoot me.  You could turn this around you know, you could tell me it was all a lie and that you still love me really and you never stopped, you could phone me, text me, say sorry like you really mean it, tell me why, but no. You don't care. Why should you? I'm only me.

      Why do you all try to tell me how great I am and how much you like me? If I were another person, I wouldn't like me, so how can I believe other people when they say they like me?  Anyway, on a lighter note, I'm not gonna dye it all over green any more cause the bleach would f*ck my hair up totally, so I'll probably end up just doing the tips and then cutting the bleached bits off when the dye's gone out or bleaching it again and dying it again.  Yeah.  Muddling along...

      I said I'd elaborate on the loads of stuff I'd bought, didn't I?  Lush pair of moonstone and garnet earrings. Relaxation Chinese ball things, the ones you roll round in your hand. Playing cards for me. Freddie Mercury tribute guy CD. Tomb Raider II guide book (bargain of the week - 20p in a charity shop!). A new diary. Some regualr hairbobbles. A cream flower hairbobble. A hairclip. Some peacock feathers from the Zoo. Some panpipes from the Zoo. A poster of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow and a poster of Orlando Bloom as William Turner, both from the Zoo. A Parker fountain pen. A cute little fluffy fox thing (I bought many of these as presents). Some funsnap things (the noisy things you throw on the street and they go bang). A new straw handbag thing. A comb. Some "short socks" from New Look (Jess, you'll know what I'm on about). Some fluffy toesocks. Some essential oils (vanilla, dewberry, lemongrass, ylang ylang). Hairdye (which it turns out I'm not allowed to do for school, and I have to bleach it anyway, so I probably won't do it all over, just the ends).A little thong necklace with an ankh on it. Some badges ("68 - I owe you one" - misubishi logo "Me So Bitchy" - "pleasure or pain?").  And my nan and grandad bought me two CDs - Dolphins - the homecoming by Richard Akrill and Guitar Serenity by Andy Marlow from the Living Coasts CD stand in Torquay.  I think that's about it, I'll edit this post later if I remember anything else.  Other people wise:  Buzzy: Minature drumkit that play "witchdoctor" by the cartoons and a keyring with his name on it. Jon: I shan't say yet cause if he reads this before Wednesday it'll spoil it. Nick: A teddy with his name on it. Brendan: Some bracelets. Siddons: A pack of cards from a casino. Patrick: A stick of rock with "pervert" written through it. Becca: A little fluffy foxy thing. Lizza: A little fluffy foxy thing. Laura: A little fluffy foxy thing. Yasmin: A little fluffy foxy thing and a keyring with a puppy saying "I'm not short - I'm under tall". Jess: A little fluffy foxy thing and a keyring with a collie with a blonde wig on saying "Of course it's natural!" - this was at the time when she had purple hair. Elizabeth: A bookmark with Friend on the top and a little poem underneath.  Again, that's all I can remember. Meh. Nobody cares all that much anyway.  *quaver* Nothing really matters... *quaver*

      Thighs... This woman on my bus got on, and Sam used to say   I   waddled, but jeez did this woman waddle. I used to think   my   thighs spread out too much when I sat down, but jeez...Seriously, she was three times the size of me - once round her, once round the freaking gas works, mate.  Anyways, rehearsal after school went okay, saw Buzz again, yay! He told me I was rude for buying a minature drumkit that plays "Witchdoctor" by the Cartoons. It wasn't that expensive, and it was all dinky and drummy. Don't kill me... To the point, despite the fact that there was only the three of us (Ging and Max couldn't make it), we played it very well, seeing as we haven't played as a group for three months. I got a stonking headache half the way through though, and stole a cup of hot chocolate from the LSCR. Buzz and I got the bus into town and he got the 94 home. I went back to the club, took some headache tablets and went to sleep for an hour then had some chicken noodles and ice cream. Separately, obviously.  I'm now at home, debating about whether to have a shower first, or practice the Fatal Tragedy keys which I finally printed off.  Meh, who cares, he doesn't...

      Rah, tired and upset and kinda verging on miserable. Except I'm seeing the large majority of my friends tomorrow, so that makes everything better. Kind of. Not really at all. But still.  I'm still cut up about the whole thing with Pete. He doesn't seem to realise how much he hurt me.

      Hiya again, and I'm back from my week's holiday!  I had a fantabulous time, I really did.  Although I learnt that Pete didn't know we'd broken up, and he actually really wasn't that bothered about it. Meh, his loss.  I spent waaaaaay too much money on other people. I spent £5 on postcards alone!  I bought myself some hairdye! It might come as a shock to a lot of people...  I chose two colours. It's going to be a mixture of the two, i.e. streaky (not bacon :P). It's a little bright, and perhaps a tad extreme, but still... *cue Buzz's drumroll*  "Tropical Green" and "Coral Blue"!  I'm not saying any more.  :P  Yeah, excessive bloggage.  Bought loooooooooads of stuff, I'll elaborate later. Gonna go have a soak in the bath now before watching Shrek 2.

      Wheee, Les Misérables fest.  Okay, dying here. Tired, need sleep. Have just told bad bad thing to a friend who's gonna be devstated. He's not speaking... Oh shite. Oh fucking shite... He's okay. He's okay.  I'm confused enough as it is, what with all that's gong on in my head about a certain two people. I mean the one person thing it's nothing major but the other thing is bloody depressing, and I'm not saying anything more on here. Pete's being a bastard. I'm still bitter about what he put me through, I don't even know why I'm still talking to him.  I'm hot and sweaty, I'm tired, I want to cry, I'm disappointed, I just wanna go curl up in bed.

      *sings* I feel good, nanananananana, I knew that I would, nanananananana, I feel good, nanananananana, I knew that I would, nanananananana, so good! So good! I got you, baby!  Yeah, I feel fine. I'm losing weight and looking great. Don't kill me for being self confident here. I wore tight fitting low cut top with jeans, rock boots and goth make-up and jewellry and felt really sexy. First time. EVER. Feeling confident in one's self is one thing, feeling sexy is something completely different.  I got the Les Mis DVD from the library today, was V. disappointed. Thought it would be acting version, as Jon's was, but no, just lameass performance of music. Well no, was v. good actually, but kina boring as was no drama.  Gonna have to go soon, can smell pizza, pizza means film.

      I'm on the road to being slim! I've lost almost half a stone in three weeks, so expect a new, slimmer me when I go back to school! But I'm not stopping until I've lost two stone at least. Then I'll be beautiful! Oh, and hopefully next week I'm going swimming!  I tried on the tight fitting slink sexy reaaaaaaaaally low cut cleavage-show-offing black top my aunt bought me for my birthday, and it fits much better!!!!!

      Two of the scariest experiences of my life yesterday.  1. Sexually harassed by a member of the Crown and Harp pool team. Looking back on it, I can laugh, cause you'd laugh if somebody said to you "wanna stroke my cue? It's just been shaved..." But while it was actually happening, I was reading my book and he was leering at me and saying stuff like that, so I ignored him, cause I was kinda scared. Fortunately ignoring him was the right tactic, he got bored and said "Good book? Sad life."  2. After everybody had left, I was sitting down the end of the club by the TV, my grandad was cashing up and my nan was tidying the snooker room. I'd turned the TV off, and the alarm on the upstairs back door went off. I knew it wasn't grampy, cause I could see him, so I thought it was nan, but after it didn't get turned off I saw nan in the snooker room, so it wasn't me, nan or grampy, so it must've been somebody else, so we went out there with a torch and my grandad got this metal bar thing that we keep behind the bar in case of stuff like that, but they'd gone, so before we shut the doors we checked the entire building, but they'd gone, and we shut the doors and we were all okay but it scared the shit out of me.  So now I'm all paranoid and defensive.

      You're lovely, and you're right, it probably will sort itself out.  Harry is evil, Yasmin's blue hair looked FABULOSO!!!  Anyway, getting bleach and peroxide kit next week to dye (the tips of? I dunno) my hair blue and/or green. Probably more green, cause Yasmin wud go mad... :-( Yeah, green it is. I might put some blue streaks in there though.  Changed my display picture to the old "Harry is a dickhead :-D" thing to piss him off now. :-D  I feel kinda hyper. And now I've got "Haaaaarry is a dickhead, a dickhead, a dickhead, Haaaaaaaarry is a dickhead, a dickhead, it's true" stuck in my head. :-(

      I keep falling for this guy. He's a guy who I genuinely get on well with and have never argued with and who accept me for who I am with no attachments. This guy, I speak to him for like two hours on the phone, and then I go all soppy after hanging up. I don't want to cause it's annoying and it gets in the way of me being normal around him, and I don't even love him, he's just one of the few friends who actually accepts me for exactly who I am, and doesn't row with me over silly little things I do, who just accepts that I do make mistakes because I'm human, and who always supports me and gives me hugs when I need them, and who listens to me when I'm feeling down. He's one of the best friends I've got, and I don't wanna lose him, but in a year's time I'm probably gonna lose all contact with him, and I don't want to, because like I said, he's one of the few people who takes me exactly as he sees me. He doesn't care whether I'm hyper or depressed, he copes with me when I am hyper and over the top, and when I'm depressed he's there for me. He doesn't ever appear to be uncomfortable around me, and he's the ONLY person who's like that, even my BEST friends sometimes feel a bit awkward when I'm hyper. He means a lot to me, and I don't think he realises how much. I'm sitting here bawling my eyes out because he's so nice to me and he's leaving in a year's time, and I don't want him to go. I feel like he understands me, who I am, more than I understand myself, and I don't wanna lose him, I don't want him to leave. He probably doesn't know who he is, but if he is reading this, then don't go. Please don't leave me.

      I promise, we will all be loved, because we're all beautiful in our own individual ways.  Yeah, soppy emotinoal bullshit, I know. But still, I like to hope there's someone out there for everyone. I dunno, I just feel really lonely at the moment. Listening to Maroon 5 doesn't help, really.  Surprisingly no bruise from the plug incident. Lucky, I guess.  Brendan's the only one online. (Not onlie.) I'm home alone again in the sweltering heat, and I've got to do English coursework.  Somebody shoot me.  No, I'm sorry, I have no reason to be depressed. I'm just really tired and I get like this when I'm tired. No matter how much sleep I have though I can nver seem to shake off the feeling of melancholy.

      I'm tired.  I stayed up until 12.15 on Friday night cutting out stars and sticking them and picture and things up on the wall ready for Emaa's disco. Then I had to get up at 7am on Saturday morning so I could get into town before Emma did. Then Jess came over and I was all happy but I spent all afternoon doing party dances (music man, superman, cha cha slide, pizza hut etc) with 5 year olds. I was extremely tired after this. I nearly fell asleep on the sofa at the club, but I didn't. Then I was hungry and had three (small...) bowls of jelly and a fairy cake. Previously my "diet" had been ruined anyway by smiley potatoes, cocktail sausages and chicken nuggets (all deep fat fried :'( so fatty) but I ruined it even more. I had a decent, 10 hour sleep last night but now I can't get back to sleep even though I'm still shattered.  I'm not okay, I'm crap, I feel ill, my head keeps spinning even when I'm sitting down, I'm tired, my nack is killing me, I'm jealous, I'm evil, and I want to die.
