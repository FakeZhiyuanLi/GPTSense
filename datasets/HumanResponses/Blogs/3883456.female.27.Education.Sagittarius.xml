      I found this on an old disc...  I used to see the sun in your eyes, Now shadows linger where light once dwelled, My days used to begin and end cradled in your arms, Now, my bed is cold, my heart even colder still, Your laughter once rang true and free, It brought me so much joy to hear it ring, Now it’s caught in your throat, just hot air, No resemblance of what it used to be, I used to love passing my time with you, Reading, walking, wrestling, playing, Now it’s a chore, I can’t get out of, Where have you gone? I don’t know, You’re not the person I once knew, You’ve become someone else, Who are you?

      I have this problem of doodling on everything, a book, loose leaf paper, my planner, anything and everything....I write all over the place and soemtimes I lose the things I write, which if they are good ( my opinion) pisses me off..the point here is that I am going to start writing or copying my writings onto this blog. My writings are pretty personal so given that I have let some of my family members and a few friends know I have this blog thing going, will be a bit strange but it's the only place I have where I can keep going back to...so whatever! Truth is most of the people who know I have this blog are not on line that often anyway. I'll pretend I don't care and just go ahead with it anyway. :-)   This first item I am going to  post, I wrote a while back, I don't even remember why I started it but it's in an old spiral bound notebook which I use for class, so I really want to get it out of there...here it is..  Someday in the twilight of your life, You'll walk down memory lane, And come across a road once traveled, You'll have forgotten that road, It's been so long, The weeds of age and time have grown over it, But perhaps you'll chance upon that road again, And remember the companion you once walked with, Someone who stood beside you, laughed with you, And loved you just as you were.  Great, now I can tear it out of the damn book and not have to worry about it anymore.  Ooops...here's another one.  Like the last remaining drop of water to a thirsty man Oh to taste the sweetness of the youth squandered away All the years, overflowing with angst, time wasted Chasing an illusive dream, perched on the morrow As darkness closes in The dawning hits, heavy with sorrow Life's lessons not found at the end of road But experienced all along the way Oh innocence lost,lead astray  Okay, that one goes too.

      Two points to note here…on my way to see the doctor, I was listening to the radio (107.7 fm). There was a contest going on, some girl was the contestant and her questions were; Who is the royal family in England? First names were fine, no last names needed. Who is the royal family in the United States? What does UFO mean? What does carte blanche mean? Use the word malicious in a sentence.    Her responses are as follows; “I don’t know his name but he’s a prince and he has a brother and his mother is Princess Diana. She died. She wasn’t a queen because she wasn’t married or else she would have been queen” “The royal family of the United States is the president.” “UFO means united foreign o-o-stronaut.” “I don’t know what carte blanche means but is it like a la carte?” “Yum..that French toast was malicious.” The dj's busted out laughing and had to stop the contest. They couldn't handle it anymore.  Last night, the Howard Stern show came on and I watched a bit. This woman, a model, was asked what her diet consisted of. Her response, I have coffee for breakfast, a diet coke for lunch, I hate drinking water, and then for dinner, I have a salad. Can I just say that based on that statement, I should be the size of a house. This morning, as you have seen, I began with French toast, a bit of eggs, half a blueberry scone, some grapes, and a big cup of coffee. That’s breakfast, or at least part of it. I would have liked some sausage or bacon with it. Love the bacon! For lunch, I’m going to have a large soup, my salad with two hard boiled eggs, and if I can find a toaster, perhaps some toast with butter.  The lunch is a quick throw together this morning because I was too lazy to get up and make a proper lunch. For dinner who knows. I don’t care I just need food.   I realize that I need to eat healthier but I also realize that people are really messed up. Can you really live on that alone? I would die. I just don’t have the desire to be thin by starving myself. I will be the first to say that a diet like hers will drive me crazy. Sure you want to look good but not at that price. The solution, the happy medium, is to eat and then work out. Yay!!!  Everybody is happy and we will no longer have hungry grown women depriving themselves of food and we will no longer have obese people.

      It's a Tuesday morning at work, I'm eating french toast and grapes. I'm also having my one cup of coffee for the day.   My task for today, aside from getting some work done is to find something I can buy J for his birthday. It's this weekend. I think I'm going to buy him a pair of Rainbow sandles cause he broke his about a month ago. That's a nice gift, with usage in mind, not just a space taker upper thing. We'll see what happens today.

      Wow!! Who knew you could get an infection from mosquito bites? I certainly found out this weekend from sitting outside after a full day of gardening. We really did some work. We created four rows for planting by mixing up dirt with potting mix and soil conditioner. &nbsp;I transplanted green beans and arugula to the main garden and also created mounds for planting zucchini and cucumbers.  &nbsp;  Just a bit after the sun set, J and I sat outside on the steps of his back porch, admiring all the work we’d done that day. He’d just finished transplanting some rosemary for ground cover and planting flower seeds. Next thing I know, there’s sharp sting on my ankle. My automatic response is to swat at it. I killed something which I am going to assume is a mosquito. After a few more bites and more swatting, I give up and retreat into the house. I put some toothpaste on my bites to cool them down and really to prevent me from scratching at it too much. There is no medical reason for applying toothpaste to your bites but it really does take away that hot feeling you get from mosquito bites.  &nbsp;  We retire for the evening. The next morning when we got up, after much wrestling, this is for some strange reason, a ritual that we do most mornings on the weekend. Being much bigger, a whole foot taller and about 50 pounds heavier, he wins and I am the loser. On this morning, I notice after our match that my thigh really, really hurts. I just assumed that perhaps in all the tumbling about, he must have hit me on my thigh and thought nothing of it. As the day progresses, my feet swell up pretty badly and my thigh continues to hurt. Feeling around the area, I notice a knot near my groin area. Long story short, I end up in urgent care and the doctor says that I’ve probably gotten an infection from the bites. My feet were really swollen and red, plus the amount of pressure in them due to all the swelling made it near impossible for me to sit or stand for any real length of time. Anyone who knows me, knows that I’m pretty active. The only time I’m lying down is when I’m reading a great book or sleeping. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I am now on antibiotics for the infection, antihistamines for the allergic reaction and swelling, Advil for pain, and a topical cream for the itching. Lovely present from a mosquito or mozzys as I am told they are called in Australia.  &nbsp;  Luckily, no West Nile virus. Well...at least there's no fever yet.

      I catch myself doing this all the time...each morning, I drive to work (UCSB) and park my car in the lot in front of my office and there's always some woman stepping out of a family van and I think to myself, please God, don't ever let me own a van. I don't like them. There's absolutely nothing wrong with owning a van,I just don't like them. Perhaps, it's not so much the van itself but what it represents..being held back by kids, a mortgage, and all that other stuff that comes with the package. Good indicator, i am no where near that part of life yet...

      Eventhough I had some homework to do, I decided to go down to San Diego with J to pick up his new car..it's actually a used car but new for him.  It's in good shape and looks great. The drive down was horrible. It's LA and Southern CA in general but oh man.  I can do without LA. We took almost every major freeway southbound and on each one, literally sat in traffic. It was unbelieveable! 101, to 118, to 405, to 110, to the 5 and then I think we just gvae up. By the time we got down to SD, we were both exhausted, stinky, and hungry. The trip back was great though, encountered just a bit on the 5 north and then it was smooth sailing. We also had dinner at one of our new fav's...IKEA. I know, isn't it romantic? We had the regular which was meatballs and potatos. Love it! Then we drove the rest of the way home and went to bed.  J's parents are great as usual but the best part, were his grandparents. They are the best people ever. I love them. The most liberal, non-religious, most informed folks, you'll ever meet. I want them for my own! Had a long but fun weekend....the end.

      The photos are old. Anyone who has seen me recently, you know that I now have very short hair. It keeps getting shorter each time I visit Pete at Salon Mod which is where I get my hair cut. I think I may grow it out again. Hair, hair, hair....ugh.

      I used to take at least 2-3 weeks off in the summer with pay and still have tons of time left for days in between here and there. Now with school, I don't have anytime at all. Even if I had all the vacation time I wanted, there'd be no time in the schedule to take a vacation. Semester system sucks.

      Since I have some time off before school begins, I thought I'd try something new and fun. I signed up for a rock climbing class at an outdoor equipment shop downtown and have been going about once or twice a week. To clarify, I am not climbing mountains or rock faces but I am climbing a rock wall, it's fake and located inside the store. Let me tell you, it is an incredible work out. I can go outside and run a mile and not break out in a sweat but working on the wall for an hour has me sweating like crazy. Sweat all over me, especially on my neck..yuck! It's one of the best workouts ever. Your arms get really tight and the kind of strength and muscles you develop is more of a lean sinewy type. No big massive biceps. I encourage all of you to try it just once.   The only draw back at this point is that my palms are still pretty soft so I have gotten blisters and have ripped off two nice size chunks of skin off my hands. Nothing major but it hurts. I fgure after about another month or two on the wall, I should have enough rough spots and calusses. The soreness should also go away so I can climb at longer intervals.   It's a lot of fun.

      The weekend was fun, busy, and costly. Went to a wedding reception for a friend of a friend. We just used it as an excuse to hang out together. The reception was held at the SB Biltmore and the food was excellent, very uppity stuff. My favorite was ahi on endives and this lobster/crab croquette thing. The bride was gorgeous as she should have been, the groom handsome, yes, a very nice wedding. I love when two people decide that they just want to be with each other and no other for the rest of their lives...That's a very special thing.   After the reception, we headed off to the Wildcat Lounge for some more dancing. Dante and I kicked up a storm, so much so that we were sweating, at least I was and I don't sweat too often.   Long night finally ended to be replaced by a calm, relaxing, but costly Sunday. Got my hair cut again, colored, and blah blah blah. I met up with another friend for some pool and then found out from the stylist(he called me) that I'd left my keys at the shop. Well, it's Monday now, so I have to go get it at about 12pm. Good thing for spares. I had a spare house key at home and  a spare car key inside my house. Figured it out and avoided freaking out too much. I did however manage to lose three pool games out of four.  Now it's Monday and just getting started for the day. Things get tough here and there but I just have to remind myself that each day will get better and life will get easier. Just remember to breathe and live it.
