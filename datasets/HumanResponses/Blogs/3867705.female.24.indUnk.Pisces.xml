         YA KNOW SOMETIME I THINK THAT I AM JUST TALKING OUT OF MY ASS. I WILL TALK TO SOMEONE AND THEY JUST LOOK AT ME AND DON’T SAY A FRICKEN WORD. I WILL ASK A QUESTION A RECEIVE NO RESPONSE. MY GRANDMA DOES THAT TO ME SOMETIMES AND I JUST WANT TO PUNCH HER IN THE FACE… AND MILETTE AND DEJA DID THAT TO ME THIS WEEK ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. IS IT BECAUSE I TALK SO MUCH THAT PEOPLE JUST START TO TUNE ME OUT? I KNOW THAT TALK ABOUT STUPID STUFF SOMETIMES, NUT WHAT CAN I SAY? INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW. IF I AM ASKED A QUESTION I ALWAYS ANSWER IT. NO MATTER WHAT THE QUESTION. IF I DON’T WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I STILL SAY SOMETHING... YES, NO, MAYBE, SOMETIMES, WHATEVER…. I DON’T KNOW IT JUST ANGERS ME A BIT. THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ON THAT SUBJECT…..     I WATCHED THE ORDER LAST NIGHT WITH HEATH LEDGER, AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT SUCKED…. HEATH LEDGER IS HOT AND ALL BUT HE COULDN’T EVEN MAKE THIS MOVIE GOOD… IT WAS SLOW AS MOLASSES AND THEY MADE HIM LOOK KIND OF BLAH, HIS HAIR WAS TOO SHORT AND IT NEEDED MORE BLOND IN IT, HE LOOKED VERY PASTY, AND PRIESTHOOD IS NOT FOR HIM…KNOW WHAT I MEAN?.... KIND OF GROTY LIKE IN NED KELLY… BUT AT LEAST HE DIDN’T HAVE TO COVER UP HIS ACCENT IN NED… THAT WAS YUMMY….WELL KIDDO'S THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY TODAY. GOING TO THE MOVIES TO   SEETHE    VILLAGE   TONIGHT AND THEN PAINTING ALL DAY SATURDAY ON GRANDMA’S HOUSE. LOTS OF FUN….     NEXT WEEK...

         Dreadfully sorry I did not jot my thoughts yester. It has been like super busy at work, even now I am busy, but I feel like I am neglecting my thoughts, they just keep swirling around in my head….of course now it is a hour and a half later….I went to scholtskyies…I don’t know how to spell it…oh and now I just got some turkey in my key board great…ok I got it out…I am ready to get our new receptionist in here so I can train them.. Guess who it is going to be…Les Breedlove...Miranda’s husband... he is such a sweetie….i think he is going to be great… he is a very warm person… harrietta potter is doing good... she is getting a bigger appetite and I think she likes to watch tv.. it’s too funny she stays down at the end of her cage(the one closest to TV) and doesn’t leave from there…I find it immensely funny… and I got home after my ferry had dropped me my house, because of all the flippin rain. Our lake in the back yard is rather nice, you’ll have to come see it soon….there was so much water it was running over the back porch, it was up over my ankles…..      Tomorrow night we are supposed to be going to see m.night Shamalon’s (misp) the village, I am not so sure about it... I am skeerd…; I will get back to work now... because I have dallied enough…     But neways.

         Work yesterday was fairly good, no big probs… I had me some good Chinese food for lunch…. Chicken and beef fried rice and crab   Rangoon  ’s… good stuff.    I drive home and decide to stop and check on Harry potter(the toad) and he or rather she is doing fine…I didn’t think she was eating, but I put more crickets in there and    I actually saw her eat one… she gets really still then jumps on them and eats em.. I didn’t see any tongues whipping out or anything… if I hadn’t been staring at the cage I would have missed it…I got online and found out that she is a southern wood house toad. And apparently all toads are poisonous they have a gland behind their    eyes and behind where their ears should be…..so gotta was the hands after every encounter with the amphibian…and    the males I guess have darker throats, that’s how I know that it’s a girl.. Cause it’s pretty white… but enough about the female TOAD CALLED HARRY POTTER… I WENT HOME AFTER HANGING WITH GRANDMA and SEBASTIEN AND WATCHED NICHOLAS NICKELBY AND THAT GUY IN THE MOVIE IS HOT……that is all I have to say….and    of course by that time it was    like 2 o’clock in the morning…I know I shouldn’t stay up that late, but sometimes it happens.     So I get in to work this morning with a surprise, chiffon has put her two week notice in. I am moving up to processor and Deja is taking over all her files... I am so excited about this change... we have to find a receptionist pretty quick... I am excited for both me and chiffon, now she can be happy at her job and I can too, because I won’t be tired of doing the same thing over and over. Know what I mean? Well I am going to get back to work…. laters

         It’s the dreaded Monday, and here we all are back at work. I am ready to go home...but I will deal with it... everyone seems fairly cordial today. Of course with   Lynn   there is always drama. But every one knows that.     Newho, (amber I know you hate that phrase) my weekend was good. Friday I went home and cleaned the living room and rearranged it. I told mom to just deal with it because I was going to arrange it how I wanted it, and she shut up. I like the way it looks now it is more pleasing to the eye and you can actually go sit down in there and watch TV if you wanted to. And I did all of my laundry on Friday night cause I knew I wouldn’t be getting home on Sunday afternoon until late.    I know I was supposed to go Shakespeare in the park, but I had to sacrifice it to get my chores done. I watched the gangs of   New York   when I was done cleaning, and you know I thought it was a pretty good movie. Everyone I have talked to said they didn’t like it, but I thought it was very well executed. I also watched Euro trip, which was hilarious, I laughed so hard I nearly peed my pants… it was really good until the brother and sister kiss, then it kinda disgusted me, but other than than that two thumbs up. I started to watch 3 ninjas, but fell asleep……Rocky loves Emily, Rocky loves Emily…..lil    dudes, we don’t want hurt you… we just want to kidnap you….ha ha good laughs…….Saturday I woke up about 9:30 with an awful headache and layed there until early realized I was awake and proceeded to pester me. Then I got up and got my stuff together and went to grandmas to pick Sebastien up…. We got our expedition started about  12:30 …. So you drive down I 20 to 820 then to 199 and you drive and drive and drive…… then you finally come to big salty and you take a right(it is on the corner of big salty and popcorn salt.. too funny.. oh you also pass    salty dog, and sea salt, and salt rock. Hee hee.    I get out there and they have a huge lot…. And the cutest little pond with a road around it. Linda circle is its name. His house is really nice and there are a lot of possibilities for the front yard…. Sunday morning he gets around to fixing my brakes. Of course my dad is a procrastinator so I have to light a fire under his tail….. I don’t want to be there all day. It only took him like 45 min to get both back brakes done. Wahoo, no more grinding!!!!!!!!Now he tells me I have a bubble in my front right tire and sure enough, I go around and look and there it is. But I have road hazard on my tires, so all I have to do is go up to firestone and get them to change it out for me. I also have a nail in one of my back tires, I wonder if that is covered too, it seems like a hazard of the road to me, right? …….Sebastien found a poor little toad out at my dad’s and of course we had to bring him home, I stopped off at petco to get supplies for him. $40 later. His name is Harry Potter. Sebastien named him not me… he is so cute… he still has a little nub where his tail was…. He’s funny I swear he was watching me last night over at grandma’s and as soon as I look over    at him he hops away real fast. Funny little critter. I know just what I need another thing to feed… I watched the 4400 and then went home and was asleep by10:30... I pretty much passed out…..I don’t know why I was so tired.

         Ok, so when I get angry at someone, this red glaze just covers my eyes and    I imagine stabbing them over and over, but I would never actually do anything like that(the thought of the blood alone is enough deterrence)I am not a killer or anything, but does having those thoughts make me a bad person? Surely not. Since I have not and will never execute any of those thoughts.     Any way enough morbidity. Is that a word? Itchihoo. I am going to go to Shakespeare in the park tonight. I forgot that it ran Friday and Saturday, which I am glad for, because I really wanted to go. I figure getting new break pads is more important than seeing a play though. But now I can have my cake and eat it too. Yeah for me.     I was thinking that I maybe I could talk amber into still going to glen rose with us……… it isn’t going to be that expensive.PLEEEEEEASE AMBER IF YOU ARE READING THIS. I won’t bother you anymore…     I am off, got finish the work load for today. Monday then.

         Nothing of interest to report today. Work was work. What more can I say? I went to tan for the first time this week, and they were hopping. I actually had to wait for a bed that has never happened to me there. Crazy! But that is of no consequence I went home and straightened on the house and took out the trash. Mom made fish filets and tater tots. I asked her if she counted them out and she just looked at me and asked if I was on drugs. She had no idea what I was talking about, so, I told her about amber the tater tot counter (heehee) we also had Mac and cheese. I watched the first two episodes of taken last night... they are so good. I forgot how spooky they were though, I was almost too afraid to get up and go to the bathroom. But I ran back to the room and jumped in bed nevertheless.     This morning I was driving to work in my miss free car, and I was thinking, I am not an aggressive person in any area of my life, at least I don’t think so. I have no competitive bone in my body. But when it comes to driving, I am very competitive. And very aggressive. If a jerk is riding my ass and then tries to go around me, damn right I am going to speed up and not let him pas, he shouldn’t have been that close to my car. It is disrespectful. I try not to ride people asses if I were to slam on my breaks they would slide right in to me…hello don’t they teach this in driving school????      Well I am not going to the Shakespeare thing on sat my dad said come on out and her would change my breaks for me… wahoo...laters

I GOT THESE REFILLS FOR GLADE OIL PLUG IN’S THAT SMELL SOOOO GOOD. IT IS CALLED COTTON. IT SMELLS KIND OF LIKE BABY POWDER MIXED WITH COCONUT WITH A HINT OF LIME.

BUT I WATCHED LOVES LABOURS LOST(SHAKESPEARE) I GOTTA BUFF UP FOR SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK ALTHOUGH I AM PROB THE ONLY ONE GOING… BUT THAT’S OK, I WILL JUST LOOK LIKE A DORK SITTING ON THE LAWN BY MYSELF WITH MY BLANKET, MUNCHIES AND DRINK.

HE WOULD HALF SIT ON THE CHAIR AND LEAN ON THE ARM REST, AND HAVE THAT GOOFY SMILE ON HIS    FACE. THE ONE HE USED TO GET WHEN HE WATCHED A MOVIE AND SOMETHING WAS FUNNY. GOOOD NEW GUYS I GOT ANGIE'S HANKIE COMPLETED.. IT IS SO CUTE, I WOULD SHOW YOU BUT I HAD TO SEND IT TODAY.

         FRIEND - A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.     THAT IS WHAT THE DICTIONARY STATES. I BELIEVE ALL OF THAT AND MORE. When you are friends with someone you share your feelings with them, you go places together and laugh about stupid things, and you cry about stupid things. What I also believe is part of a friendship is respect. You respect your friends’ feelings and vice versa. If a friendship is one sided, can that be considered a friendship?             My weekend was good. Friday night I went out to amber’s house. It is too cute for words, lots of little nooks and crannies to personalize. We ate hamburgers and tater tots. Matt couldn’t get their brand new grill to work, so he was a little flustered and said he was going to take the pos back. Amber had to fry the burgers on the grill, but hey I kinda like em better that because it has more grease…mmmmm…. And apparently, I didn’t know this, but on the back of the tatertot bag, it says that you are supposed to serve 9 tots per person. Amber had all the tatertots on a cookie sheet ready to put in the oven, and I was like, surely you are going to put more on there? It only took up half of the sheet. She had actually sat there and counted out the tater tots per person... too funny. Instead of a cookie cutter house she has a tater tot counter house…hee hee……then on Saturday I mowed the front lawn, but I ran out gas so I didn’t get to the back. I thought well I’ll trim the front hedges.. The electric trimmer made my arms hurt sooo bad, I could barely even hold a glass of water. I didn’t even realize that I had that many muscles in my lower arms…then I went out to Katie and Steves for a barbecue. Katie and I drank a bottle of wine before any one even got there. Although, that is not saying much. For dinner we had brisket, homemade Mac and cheese, reeeeally good onion basil dip with sourdough bread (at least I think it was sour dough bread) Katie made fresh pickles, she also made this bean salad, and you know how I feel about beans, it was a little iffy to me. But I tried some nevertheless. not bad…oh and tiffany made this wonderful lemon cake that just melted in your mouth….then stevie and all his buddies played poker(not really my cup of tea)      We watched the first episode off the 4400… it was good… I think I am hooked... I had to go over to grandma’s Sunday to watch the second episode.Good stuff. You know me and alien shows…. Sunday I watched pride and prejudice (the one with Colin Firth when he is really young and very handsome) he is a cutie. Although it was 5 hours long… then I watched sex and the city season one (not bad) I had seen a lot of those episodes. Then went to grandmas made her and sebastien dinner, and watched the 4400. I rummaged around in her sewing room and found some really pretty lace to put on the hankies, since I can’t get the surger to cooperate. Then I went home and read some poems out of my old poetry book form when I was in high school, and  some of the poems I had marked as my favs, I reread them and I just don’t see what it was that was so special about them, some yes, but some…no. such is life.

      Since it is now Friday, I will have to combine Thursday and Friday. Thursday was a bitch of a day. I love my job I really do, I like to help people. And I love my coworkers. Chiffon is so hateful sometimes, it makes work very unlikable, and I am her second hand person. I think she is a good person at the center of tings, but at the same time very selfish and she has to have her way all the time. I sometimes feel like just looking for a new job because I can’t stand all the rage that builds in me when she is ugly to me. I don’t get paid enough to be unhappy. Especially when I start dreading when I come to work. I just wish she wasn’t so fricken stubborn.  Anyways, I had to work late yesterday until about 6:30, i was finishing straightening my desk and Lynn just walks out and doesn’t even wait for me. So I am locking up I pinch my code into the alarm and hit arm, then hurry and lock the door. Only I can’t get the lock to turn. Time is running out (you only have 60 sec) so I have to hurry inside and disarm the alarm, and the retry, well this went on for about 20 min before I finally got the lock to go. I think I gave myself a blister on finger….I go tan next, in and out, snap snap. Home, finish watching the stand (I love that movie) asleep by 12:30. Although I couldn’t find Early, he has been sleeping with me every night for awhile now... he kinda hurt my feelings. This morning I guess my mom let him in the house, and he sure was trying to get in my room, I just told him no, he would have to wait until later, he should have come home earlier…….get dressed for work. (Jean day)Wahoo. I decided to change out my necklace that I have been wearing for about two months straight, I figure I had better or else it would start to become part of my skin. I polish up my new necklace and my rings and decide to put on a bracelet. I am now feeling very girly. Drive to work, and there is so much traffic!! Where did it all come from???? I’ll tell ya, it came from the stupid street cleaners taking two lanes of the four lane hwy……arrrrgh……..barely get to work on time, but the mood in the office seems to be lighter today. I am so glad. I called my dad to see if we could get together the following weekend, Linda said that would be good, I still haven’t seen their new place. Maybe I can get my mom to come with me, so she won’t bitch about me not being there to help her with the house(sorry I have a life)…….now I am eating my lunch of chicken noodle soup, and a taco from the bell..Mmmmm…..I am going out to amber’s tonight to see her new house and her new car, since i haven’t seen either. We are going to cookout; it will be good to spend some time with her, since we never really get to hang out because of our busy schedules. Oh yeah and I have to take her movies back to her that I have had since like February I think... and to let her have the next book in the series of unfortunate events, and amber if you are reading this I have put these items in my car, they are there now, I will not forget them again. Tomorrow I am mowing grandma’s lawn for her, she is going to be picking out paint for the house with Denise all day prob, so I thought I would surprise her…the around 3ish I am going over to Katie to help her prep for her and stevies barbecue….. So I guess that I will se all you cats on the flip side.L8rs.

      WEDNESDAY WAS JUST SUPER BUSY AT WORK, NO BIG PROBLEMS. I ATE MY HOT POCKET. IT WAS A BARBECUE HOT POCKET IT WAS A LITTLE STRANGE, NOT AS GOOD AS I HAD HOPED. I DRIVE HOME AND THE TRAFFIC REALLY WASN’T THAT BAD, WHICH IS VERY SURPRISING... SO, I’M ALMOST TO GRANDMA’S HOUSE AND IT LOOKS REALLY STRANGE, THERE IS SOMETHING  MISSING FROM THE DRIVE WAY, SHE SOLD THE OLDSMOBILE!!!! IT IS NO LONGER THERE. SHE ONLY GOT $200 FOR IT, BUT WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM AN 83 OLDSMOBILE? I WALK IN AND THE HOUSE IS SUPER DARK WITH NOTHING BUT THE TV ON, AND ALL THE DRAPES CLOSED.DEPRESSAMUNDO.I AM TRYING TO GET HER TO WORK ON HER SEWING MACHINE SO I CAN FINISH MY HANKIES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY SHE WAS NOT ABLE T GET THEM WORKING, SO NOW I HAVE TO SEE IF I CAN GET MOM’S TO WORK, SO KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. HER AND SEBASTIEN PLAY OUT IN THE SPA/POOL EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SPRAYED FOR THE WEST NILE VIRUS RECENTLY, SHE SEEMS TO THINK SHE IS IMMUNE TO IT, MAKES ME ITCH JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. SO WE GO IN FINALLY AFTER MANY NEAR BITE SITUATIONS WITH THE MOSQUITOES. SHE GOES INTO THE COMPUTER ROOM, AND I GO SIT IN THE LIVING ROOM AND SEW FOR A LITTLE BIT. TURN THE TV OFF, AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT SOME ONE HAD JUST DROPPED A  HOUSE ON THE WICKED WITCH OF THE WEST ALL OVER AGAIN. SEBASTIEN COULDN’T UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS TURNING THE TV OFF. I TOLD HIM BECAUSE I WANTED PEACE AND QUIET. OF COURSE NOW HE IS PESTERING THE SHIT OUT OF ME. SO I TEACH HIM THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW. AND YOU KNOW THAT LITTLE SHIT CAN REMEMBER THE EXAMPLES I GIVE HIM TO HELP HIM REMEMBER THE COLORS IN ORDER, BUT HE CAN’T SEEM TO REMEMBER THE COLORS IN ORDER. APPLE, PUMPKIN, SUN. GRASS, SKY, AND HARRY POTTER PILLOW (DON’T ASK, WHICH I AM SURE YOU CAN GUESS) THEN HE STARTS SPOUTING,” DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE RAINBOW IS?” IT IS GOD’S PROMISE TO US THAT HE WILL NEVER FLOOD THE EARTH AGAIN. WELL, I WAS JUST FLABBERGASTED, TALK ABOUT A CHILD MAKING YOU FEEL STUPID. BUT THEN I STARTED TO REMEMBER, JUST A SMALL BLIP ON THE BARBARA SCREEN. I WANTED TO ASK SEBASTEIN WHY GOD FLOODED THE EARTH IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND WHY HE DIDN’T WARN MORE PEOPLE BESIDES NOAH AND HIS FAMILY AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO CHANGE. BUT ANYWAYS, I STARTED TO LEAVE SHORTLY AFTER THAT, AND SEBASTIEN DIDN’T WANT ME TO GO(IT WAS REALLY CUTE)HE PILED ALL OF HIS COVERS AND PILLOWS FROM THE COUCH AND HIS BEAN BAG IN FRONT OF THE DOOR SO I COULDN’T LEAVE. I T MADE ME FEEL GOOD THAT HE WANTED ME AROUND. IT’S GOOD TO FEEL LOVED. SOMETIMES I FORGET.

      Yesterday was completely normal, which is a really nice change. I enjoy normalcy sometimes. I worked diligently all day. I got in my car to leave and realized I didn’t have any cigarettes. But I figure after tanning I am not going to want one from being so hot. I go to tan and I just love my new tanning lotion. It is called beach bum rum. And it smell like a German chocolate cake baking, it also has gold flakes in it so we all know I am already in love with it. I get gas afterwards and it seems to be on sale at the racetrack for 1.77 a gall, which is better than most I suppose. Then I scrape together some change and go to bell for my new found love the crunchy supreme taco…mmmmmm goooood……then I am driving home and I am driving next to this jeep, and it looks like me.. I think when I pay this car off that is what I am going to get. One of those jeeps where you can take the doors and the roof off... that is my kind of car, and yes I know they have a high turn over  rate, but hey you only live once and I should have what I want right…? I went home after having my daydream of cool feet. The watched the stand... well the first episode anyway. Finished tiffany and amber’s hankies... they are so cute, I should have them completely finished by this weekend... and amberi haveno idea when that pic was taken... but it was the only one I had of myself onmy computer at work... Well besides that one i have with a bra on my head... haha... good times

      I guess I got a little sunburned on my shoulders at dinosaur valley because I was sweating bullets last night and the night before, I was just thinking that my mother turned the AC up where we weren't getting as much COOL air. But any ways. Yesterday was long, I barely had time to eat lunch and go to the bathroom... I had to go through our new website for work with a fine tooth comb, and let me tell you reading all that shit gets very boring.... But I found like two pages of mistakes, so hopefully we can get all of that fixed and then no more worries right?.... I finished watching my last disk of quantum leap last night, I now I am kind of sad cause I have to wait another 6 months before the next season comes out... It's bad enough that I have to wait until September for Roswell season 2 and angel season 4 to come out... arrrrrggggghhhh ....And the I watched this really strange movie, it's called Hans Christian Anderson:my life as a fairytale. It's his life but with a bunch of his stories incorporated in.. It was really interesting, a few of you will like it, those with flights of fancy in your mind.. Anyways it was pretty good,but now I have no movies to watch......Drama.. Well not really but my kind of drama...L8rs

      Well, Katie and I went to Fossil Rim this weekend. (Out in Glen Rose) We had a blast!! We arrived in Glen Rose around 10:30 11ish. We stop at a Citgo, I believe, to get some ice for the water that we are going to so desperately need. So of course Katie and I have to pee because we had margaritas for breakfast. (Heehee) the bathroom at this place I fairly clean except for the boogers that someone has wiped on the wall next to the toilet. Very charming, let me tell you. I go to leave the LOO and I reach for the handle. It is so low that I actually have to lean down to get to it. This makes me chuckle just thinking about it…..Now we are on our way to Fossil Rim…..We go through and pay the fee for the park. So we are putting along….Putt putt putt putt…..About ¾ of the way to the half way point(sorry if that phrase if confusing) my car starts to get hot, it doesn’t overheat or anything, but it scares the bageesus out of me. And of course the guy in front of me, who had to ride my butt and then speed around me when he got the chance, is not going at a snails pace. So I am driving along on pins and needles, and Katie almost gets mauled by some disco goat looking things, which was hilarious by the way… we finally arrive at the half way point and let the car cool off and give it some water and all is well…. We leave and it is about 1:30ish at this point, so we decide to go to downtown Glen Rose, which is super cute, it reminds me of Lake City, CO. We shop around there, go into lots of antique stores, some that are barely standing, and you almost fall through the floor whilst walking through…. I got the cutest candle holder that mounts on the wall, it has wings behind it. I just love it, and I also found this antique colander... It is made of tin and the holes in it form stars. I thought it would be cute on the wall in the kitchen….So we drive on down a bit and find this little place to pull off on the side of the road, and voila` there is the paluxy, but watch out there are amoebas….. Big sign posted telling you this... Makes you want to get in the water huh?…but nevertheless we go in(we brought our swim suits) and it is really warm right here the water I mean, very shallow water  running over huge smooth rock, but we find ablazea place amidst all the people and pop a squat in the running water. It is refreshing. However there are these little pesky bugs that build their homes on the rocks with the running water... But they bite and it feels like a little pin prick, Katie did'nt’t believe me at first, but then she started getting bit too.so we leave and I guess it is about 5:30 6ish  and we went to a hotel somewhere in  between there, I don’t rightly remember when.so Katie got a Glenrose newspaper and see this sign for this restaurant called the loco coyote bar and grill, it is about 5 miles off of 67.it hasfree beer unsaturated, so of course we are all over it. We drive on down 67 and come to CR 1005 or whatever and we turn onto it and then... we drive ad drive and drive, and finally get to this hole in the wall place in the boonies, and it is someones house and the have put picnic tables out side.. We were a little afraid, so we turned around. I just had images of a really bad b movie running through my head where the two young girls disappear while out of town never to be seen or heard from again, all that is found is the car with blood stains in the floor board, but anyway, we left in a hurry.. Settled on a restaurant off the main road, in plain sight. Which it was really good. they had awesome tortilla soup… by the time dinner was over we were both bushwhacked, so we pretty much went to the hotel and passed out before 10 o’clock. Pretty sad I know. And what’s sadder is that we woke up at 7:30 the next morning…We went to Dinosaur Valley that morning, hiked, swam, saw some fhish and crawdads, and some dinasaur tracks.... i am ready to go back with allmy compadres....I give Glen Rose  five stars....

      Ok, so I try to start every day with a smile, but we all know that does not happen the morning, so i just don’t speak until I have taken my Excedrin. Well, my mother is leaving the house, and I am still in bed, and she yells at me “Do you have any asprin?”Then I hear her clicking down the hall towards my room. Not in here mom, in the big pocket in my purse. Am I the freakin Excedrin keeper? What’s up with that? So of course my ay starts out just wonderful…..I decide to try and makemy day go better, I am going to burn a cd before I go to work. Blue Hawaii by Elvis. I actually got it to work, so that is a plus for me. So I drive to work, I hit a little traffic, so I am like 4 or 5 min late. Well apparently all hell broke loose overnight at the office, and it looks like everyone is blaming me. WHATEVER!!!! It’s not my fuckin fault that fax that came in yesterday after noon and is not on chiffon’s desk, when I know that I put it in her inbox before I left. What else am I supposed to do? Put a GPS Tracking Device on a piece a paper? Get Real. And then our email went down yesterday because the domain company accidentally activated our new website early.. and  of course this is my fault too, because I have been  working with website guy, once again, I just do what I am told….I Can’t help it. And then with Chiffon doing her cute ignoring act, and only talking to certain people in the office. I just don’t understand … Anyways, I will get off of my high horse.. I am through.  On to more enlightening topics, I am so excited I am getting quantum leap disk 2 this weekend…. I forgot how much I loved that show. I remember getting home from school and watching reruns at four o’clock on TV…I’m also getting kissing Jessica stein? Has anyone seen that…? Also Beowulf, I loved that when we read it in school, it kind of reminds me of the Eaters of the dead by Michael Crichton. Well I suppose I will close off for the day. Next week then.

      So I have been thinking that I might make quote hankies, I have found a whole bunch that I like and put quotes on them,the hankies I mean, what do ya think? any ways I had an excellent time this weekend, so much food, so little time.. Disarono on the rocks!!! so, I figure I  will take Sebastien's TV from his room over to grandma's and put it in grandaddies room and hook grandma's extra DVD player up to it, I figure I will be much more comfortable when I don't have to watch the fricken coldcase or law and order and those other medical law  shows(that is all that grandma watches I swear) and trying to get her to change the channel is like trinket get blood out of a turnip.... I don't want her to be lonely and sad, but I don't want to be miserable either, and if I can't watch my movies, we all know that makes and unhappy barb. Oh by the way I forgot to tell you guys,  as you know I received in the signed waiver for the divorce and I got it mailed off to the lawyer, I spoke with her and she said that we aren't going to have to go to court, we will just draw up the decree and  have him sign something stating that he has seen it.. Isn't that great, so maybe I will be divorced by the end of this month!!!! Wouldn't that be a momentous event in history.

      This is my first entry and I am not really sure exactly what I am doing, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. So, here goes. I thought this would be a good idea for me and my friends, I guess it is kind of like a website, and then I guess they can post there comments or suggestions on here too.. Ok so I went and saw Sleep Over last night and it was pretty cool.(don't make that face I had free tickets from a coworker) But, I went home and my mom and grandma were in a state of panic, and I was like what the hell is the matter with you guys? And they go Sebastian swallowed a drinking straw. I said is that all?" His stomach acid will totally dissolve that before morning is even here, and what it doesn't, he will pass. We are talking about thin plastic, Haas swallowed bigger things than that before and he was perfectly fine.

         WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE FALL? MAKES YOUR HEART POUND, YOUR BLOOD RACE. IS IT THE FALLING OF THE LEAVES? THE WIND ON YOUR FACE AND IN YOUR HAIR? THE SMELL OF DECAYING LEAVES THAT IS SOMEHOW COMFORTING? THE RICH COLORS OF AUTUMN.   ORANGE-   PUMPKIN, BROWN LEAVES, GOLDEN SUNSETS, COOL BREEZY EVENINGS THAT GIVE OFF A RED   HUE  . WHY DO I LONG FOR FALL? SUMMER GROWS TIRESOME. WHY SO LONG? ALTHOUGH I DO LOVE THE BRIGHT COLORS. THEY DO LINGER SO. BRING THE DAY WITHOUT HEAT. AND EVENING WITH WINDOWS DOWN AND VANILLA CANDLES ON ALL HALLOWS EVE. WHEN DRESSING BECOMES MORE LAX and people are not so cranky of tepid air...     OF COURSE ALL WHO KNOW ME WILL NOT TAKE SURPRISE. FOR ONCE FALL IS HERE I SHALL YEARN FOR WINTER WITH WHITE CAPS AND GLOVES AND SCARVES. DREAMS OF SNOWFLAKE. CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ALL A TWINKLE. EGG NOG, SMOKED   TURKEY  , SWEET POTATOES. OH HOW I DO YEARN FOR THOSE DAYS OF JINGLES ALL AROUND. MIMOSA’S FOR BREAKFAST ON THE NEW DAY. WINTER TARRIES LONG THOUGH. NOW I AM MELANCHOLY FOR A WARMER DAY. I SUPPOSE THAT I REALLY DO NOT ENJOY THE SEASON UNTIL IT HAS PASSED. DO I YEARN FOR THE PROCEEDING SEASON ALWAYS?             I WORK SO MUCH ON MY CAR THAT I THINK MYSELF AN EXPERT. ONLY WISHING. I AM ALMOST COMPLETELY DONE WITH MY CAR REPAIRS. BRAKES – CHECK, TIRES – CHECK, OIL – CHECK, STP – CHECK CHECK CHECK CHECK, CAR SPUTTERING-1, CAN I FIX IT? -1 DOES ANYBODY CARE?-1              I GUESS SOMETIMES I FEEL MISUNDERSTOOD. I.E. SOME PEOPLE THINK ME TO BE BITTER TOWARD MEN BECAUSE OF PAST DEALINGS. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. SOME, YES, OTHERS, N0. WHEN I MEET A MAN, IF HE HAS CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE BAD ONE, THEN YES I GENERALLY DISLIKE HIM. NOW I HAVE LOST TRAIN OF THOUGHT. SO, MAYBE THE THOUGHT WILL COME AGAIN LATER….
