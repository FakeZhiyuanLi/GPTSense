      Well, this was bound to happen, but so far no pregnancy. I can feel my cycle approaching and although it's very early in our adventure, I feel somewhat disappointed. I also feel silly since it would really be a stroke of luck if we got pregnant this early into the game, but I still feel some disappointment.  I've also learned that two of my friends are pregnant, two whom I'd least suspect. I'm envious of them, but very happy. I can't wait to chat with them about babies. I've been buying needlework patterns to stitch for when my baby comes. Some of them are just gorgeous, while others cute. I guess in a way, the time that I'm not pregnant, gives me more time to prepare. Still I'm impatient and have been the type of person who would  in anticipation for a birthday get sick to her stomach, so I'll have to see how I do with this baby thing. Afterall, being sick to one's stomach in this case might be a good sign!

      After a very long weekend, I have finally found some time to post. I had a friend over who's daughter was in a serious car accident a few years ago, leaving her with serious brain injuries. Her daughter has slowly beaten many odds and is now in a wheelchair and continuing to make improvements every day. She still has a long way to go, but I personally believe that there will be a point in time where she will have made a great recovery. My friend was staying at my place as she needed a break from caring for her daughter and that her husband is an emotionally abusive slimeball. I found my diploma in working with abused women very handy! But I am really emotionally exhausted, plus Chris and I got off track for babymaking!   I was also watching Steel Magnolias tonight for the millionth time, that and my friend's situation made me wonder what it must be like as a mother to have a child who is sick or injured, and what if that happened to me. Would I stand up to the strain? I'd like to think of myself as strong and actually really identify with the Sally Field's character, but she too eventually had a point where she broke. However conveniently for the movie, her child had passed from the illness, and she made a miraculous recovery. I just don't know if I would have that strength. I guess it's not something to dwell on, if it happens, it happens.  On a more interesting note, I also had moments today where I wondered if I truly wanted a child. Life as I knew it would change, playing Nintendo might not be an option *gasp!!* Okay not the worst thing to happen. I might morph into someone completely different, people might treat me differently. I don't want to be one of those mothers who wear pastels, walk in convoys taking up all the room in coffee shops, never showing any negative emotion with their friends who all have children the same age, yet passive aggressively live vicariously through their children. At the same time, I don't want to be without support from friends and family. Most of my friends...well suffice it to say, aren't interested in children, and those who are, I'm not terribly close to. I can picture one family friend who has a couple of kids, and is running for father of the year. I know the minute he were to find out we were expecting, his behaviour would instantly change towards me, and I might have to deck him. See...not very motherlike of me!  That said, I just learned that a friend of ours is pregnant. She is the last person I'd expect to have a kid this decade, she has a heart of gold, but just seemed like she was enjoying just being the happy married couple with few responsibilities other than their dogs. But sure enough she's preggers. I figure she would be a good friend to bond with, since I don't think motherhood would change her core very much. In addition learning that she was pregnant just really confirmed that I wanted to be a mom. Anyhow, the trying still goes on. I'm feeling hungry all the time actually, but maybe it's just all the exercise I've been getting. ;)

      Well today is another day. I'm sitting here wondering what kind of parent I would make. I'm busy scrambling to tidy my home as we're having a houseguest for the weekend, and I realise that my mother's house was always tidy for company. I'm sure the same with Chris' mother. Great! I'm going to be a messy mom, my kids will be messy in 16 years, when I finally mature, I'll be screaming at them to clean their rooms and I'll have no one to blame but myself.  I think the whole prospect of parenthood leads to a lot of introspection. For example, I swear a lot, so I've been trying to make it a point not to swear, so far it's day two and I'm already twitching. I always thought that I would be the same type of parent as I would person and that I'm not going to switch into the pastel wearing, SUV driving, bouncy haircut soccer mom to conform to society, but I do see myself changing in many ways. I'd hate to think of my kid running up to an adult and listing off a host of swear words because they heard mommy saying it. And what about mommy playing Nintendo. My mother played it, but by the time we had it, I was about 12, so those formative years were without the technology. I still like to play, but I'd like to save off the brain numbing til my kid hits a reasonable age. Nutrition is pretty covered, since I am an accomplished cook (if I do say so myself) so I don't have to worry about tonnes of processed foods or such. But then I wonder, if everyone worries about similar things and ends up becoming more relaxed as time goes along.   I then start thinking about things such as time management, is there enough time in the day for a kidlet?? Doesn't seem so, I wonder how people do it, since they don't come with booklets people have to learn on the fly, I just wonder how I'll cope. A few parents have told me that dogs are good preparations for having babies, but you can't crate babies when they're driving you nuts. Dogs are usually adults and have all the routines they need set by 2, babies are still...babies at two. Those parents are crazy, or they've never had a dog before!  I'm purposely avoiding baby programs, I don't want to see the labour, or the pain. I'm determined to go as natural as possible and fortunately midwives are covered in Ontario by OHIP, and I understand there will be a lot of pain involved. I just don't need to see it on The Learning Channel at 2 and 4pm.   Anyhow, not a lot of time to post today, I'm still cleaning for the houseguest and since it's blistering hot out today, I think I might order a pizza for dinner.

      I guess introducing myself would be good. I'm Joy, mother of zero, I have a husband named Chris, we have two dogs, Banzai and Shenanigans and a catlike creature we call Punky. Chris and I have been married five years and have been an item for eleven years. We live in Toronto Canada, in a neat little house, on a small ravine towards the edge of the city. I'm out of work and Chris (who I might refer to as Dear Hubby or DH) owns his own software business. This year, we both got hit by the need to create little offspring of our own. We figure in 18 years if us and all our left wing friends have children, the NDP in Canada might have a chance of finally forming a government. If we're lucky, even sooner!   It's interesting why people need feel the need to reproduce. Plenty of people argue that the world is overpopulated as is. I wonder if that's so, certainly there are people who are dying in nations because they don't have food to eat, however I wonder if that has so much to do with population, rather than the strict control of resources by a few (most Canadians included!), while the rest suffer in poverty. Anyhow, I don't know the answer, I just suspect that the answer is less cut and dried than "Too many people!" Anyhow, I can say that as of lately, the urge to have a child, that biological clock has been ticking loudly, for both of us.  We're both hoping for a girl, although Chris who was more absolute before we started trying is now ambivilant. I still would like a girl...*g* We officially started trying two days ago. Which means adding more activity to our day than usual, which we're both more than fine with. *G* Despite myself not being a morning person, I'm not too hesitant to wake up these days. This morning Chris surprised me with a chocolate in bed. Either he wanted to avoid morning breath or to give me a surge of sugar, I'm not sure. I suppose he was being nice too!   I asked a question on the forum I visit about when women generally start getting morning sickness. I know it's probably way to soon to be experiencing it, but today while watching Star Trek I became really nauseous. I got to the point where I had to lay down for an hour and a half and didn't even try to tough it out for my favourite program. I had a big second thought about this whole pregnancy thing. If I do get morning sickness, I'm going to be miserable. I hate feeling nauseous! I hope the little one (Lo) appreciates this! I imagine it was just because I spent the morning outside running errands on the first really hot day of the year...I mean, how fast can one conceive???  It's funny because I mentioned on the forum that we would most likely be starting this year, and there are people who I consider close friends, friends and friendly acquaintances who seem to be more eager than we are. It's really nice in a way, like a whole bunch of cyber relatives eager to do some cyber cheek pinching. Although I do regularly meet with many of the posters on the forum, so I think they'd get to meet Lo in person. Our parents have been pretty cool about it. Chris' parents are eager, although they're reigning in their anticipation. Although a couple of days ago, Chris' mom gave me a bunch of baby comics she had been clipping. My mom is less restrained, she can't wait, I think she's waiting on payback for all the things my grandmother used to let me get away with.  We've already decided that Chris' best friend will be the godfather. He's excellent with kids, a good family friend and super responsible. Fact of the matter is that most people would be hard pressed to dislike this guy, even though he can be super pessimistic...he's a taurus afterall!  The dogs are taking it all in stride. Banzai is ten, he's always loved children, we suspect that he'll take the role of guardian, not letting anyone but immediate family, grandparents and DH's best friend touch the baby. I feel very secure with Banzai standing watch. He's a German Shepherd and know that he is capable of being a child's best friend and an intruder's worst enemy. Shenanigans is our Newfoundland. True to the breed, he is exceedingly gentle and loves children. He's a fun-loving albeit not the brightest dog out there. However I have no concerns of him being of any danger to our lo. The cat I'm a bit worried about, he is just the type who would enjoy snuggling up to baby or have a weird personality change. We'll have to deal with that when and if it happens. Although, the question is whether Punky will be allowed near lo since Banzai is on duty and has a slightly strained relationship with Punk.  Anyhow, this is turning into a novel and not an journal entry, but a basic introduction to who we are, and beginning our adventures of babymaking!
