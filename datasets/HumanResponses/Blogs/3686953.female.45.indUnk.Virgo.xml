      Bigguy's left to go sit outside the theater at Concord Mills again.  He goes to watch how many people are going into his new favorite film, Fahrenheit 911, and to wait for any neocons to leave talking trash.  He's tells everyone to go see the film.  Mom & I are going to go later this week, we've been busy, or we'd have already gone.

      Well, after many months of thinking Lester was a hermaphrodite, his gonads finally showed up.  Of course, you know what happens next--today he becomes a eunuch!  We took him to the vet this morning, where the little thing will spend the next 2 nights, probably wondering what he did wrong, and why we left him.  I feel very bad, but if a dog isn't going to use them, he's got to lose them.

      Yesterday, I took the boys to be groomed, and they all look beautiful.  Fozzy has never been so fluffy, he looks like a giant cottonball with three black spots.  The only problem is that both Fozzy & Frisky are both acting out of sorts.  Both keep curling up in their beds looking all depressed.  I hope they didn't catch anything from a strange dog at the beauty shop. I even made them Filet mignon & salmon for dinner last night (Frisky has always been a surf & turf guy).  They ate it, but still didn't perkup.  Maybe when Craig arrives later, they'll be happy again.  Then again, could be sad because they heard Lindsey would not be coming with Craig for this visit, since the only thing they like more than a good meal, is a beautiful woman.  I wish Lindsey was coming as well, I feel so badly that living so far away, I am unable to help with errands, and planning the wedding.  Both Craig & Lindsey work so hard studying for their upcoming careers, I hate that I can't help make their lives easier by doing pidddly, little things for them.  Maybe we'll buy some more wedding gifts this weekend, Mom always says shopping makes it easier!  Love to everyone, I probably won't have much time to blog this weekend.

      Gini and I walked the mall today, as we were going in, I noticed that she had one of her earrings on backwards.  I was about to tell her, when she ran over to look at the royal blue glassware in TJ Maxx, yet again.  Then I forgot.  We went on about our day, when suddenly at 10:15pm, Gini rubs her ear, and realizes what she had done.  I laughed.    Today, I hate when people cut their grass and don't bag it, or blow it off their sidewalks, then when it rains, and it gets all over some little, white, fluffy puppies.

      Today's been an exceptionly boring day. The biggest excitment was that I decided to try making spaghetti squash, it was pretty good.  Now I'm watching the AFI music special, and yelling everytime some doofus interupts the song to tell some assine story, shut up and let me hear the song.  I don't hate much today, guess kicking up the zoloft worked.

      I just wanted to tell Craig that I am very sorry that I did not let him know I had started writing a blog.  It was wrong, and I should have told him about it before anyone else, since he is the most important person in my life.

      I've tried to publish two different things this morning, and I got error messages, and then my writngs disappeared into cyberspace.  There wasn't much, just some venting, but I still will have to try to rewrite the posts later.  I hope this isn't a sign of things to come the rest of the day.

      I always knew I didn't like to share, but I thought it'd be easier to share my thoughts writing a blog.  My mother & sister seem to have no problem coming up with semi-interesting things to write, while I come up with zippo.  Oh well, I will continue on, only because I hate being left out.   It's raining today, and mom is washing grandma's hair, and then she will have to make her half a 99 cent side salad from Wendy's.  I don't understand how anyone can eat the same thing everyday for breakfast and lunch.  And half a side salad with watered down vinegar & oil dressing is just disgusting, I find myself longing for the days of a junior bacon cheesburger, without the cheese, add tomato,onion,  and ketchup.  And, what drives me more crazy, is that mom will soon be asking me what I'm going to make for dinner, since grandma hasn't had a home cooked meal in two days.  Neither have we, and none of us are complaining.   I guess I do have a few things to write about, or vent about, this blog make just be the answer after all!  Another thing I hate, days getting shorter.

      Since everyone else is starting a blog, I guess I can't be left out of the loop! I don't have a word of the day, but I will pass on this insight to my personality... I hate perky people.

      This morning as I was reading the Times, I came across an article about a place in Little Italy that is owned and frequented by real life mafia people.  I continue reading, and the name of the restaurant sounded familiar to me, I went to the fridge and found the postcard from the place we've gone to for lunch several times, Il Palazzo-it was the SAME PLACE!  Apparently, a member of the Bonanno Family runs the place, and members of the mob often meet there to discuss "business".  I guess Erin really belong there, since she threatened us if we touched her ravioli!    On another note, did anyone else catch Barack Obama's speech at the DNC tonight?  He was fantastic.  I hate people who talk on their cell phones when they are merging onto busy interstates.

      and we once again went to Godiva!  Gini, Gary, Cory, & I went into town today, Gini & I were suppose to get our hair cut, but Teri's appointment person wrote down the wrong day, so it'll have to wait until next week.  Since we were already in South Charlotte, I decided we should just go over to Southpark for lunch at Gar's favorite, The Cheesecake Factory.  Cory ordered a cheeseburger, and since they don't have a children's menu, our server told us about the mini-burger appetizer.  We ordered it, and when it came, there were four little burgers, Cory was sure it was because it was his birthday (which we all know was on July 6th, but Chepke boys love their days!)  Gini and I both had a smaller lunch sized salad- I don't know how big the full sized salad is, we couldn't finish the ones we had.  While we were eating, Gary tried to convince us to go into the mall so he could look around in Tiffany's.  I wonder were he got that from?!?  Afterwards, we went to SuperTarget to buy camping supplies-FUN!    I hate when people are dressed from head to toe in Lily Pulitzer, and they think their restaurant servers don't deserve a decent tip.

      The Ginster and I went to Southpark today.  We said it was to check on a pair of shorts we're waiting to be marked down, but the real reason was to go to Godiva.  They have a special fresh raspberries in a dark chocolate dessert cup that may be one of the best things I've ever tasted.  If you can, get to your closest Godiva and try them while they're still in season.  They also have them in white & milk chocolate cups, but we're hardcore chocolate people.  On our way back to the north side of town, we stopped at one of my favorite places in Charlotte, Paper Skyscaper.  I bought a book, magazine, and a anti-Bush pin for Bigguy.  The just recieved a huge shipment of new merchadise, and I really loved looking at everything.    Today, I hate when people don't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.

      I don't understand why some people have eyebrows so full or bushy, that they have to wax them down, but others have none or next to none.  I am in the next to none category, and from the looks of it, heading quickly into the none.  I read in magazines and see people on TV telling how to create the perfect arching eyebrow, but I'd have better luck at a perfect arching mustache.  Oh well, who cares, I'll just have to wear bangs until I'm 93.

      My name is Dawn, and I am a purse-aholic.  For years, I never carried a purse.  I don't know when it happened, but one day I couldn't stop looking at purses.  Every store I go in, I look at their selections, picking them up, looking through them, coveting them, and yes, sometimes even smelling them.  That's how I found myself the other day in Belk at Southpark Mall, wondering through the Kate Spade display, when I saw an extra 40% off sign.  At first I thought someone had put the sign there by mistake, I mean, why would they be reducing Kate Spade?  I looked at every purse, bag, wallet, and keychain on the display.    I kept picking them up and looking in the mirror to see how I'd look carrying each one.  Even with the discount, I couldn't see spending money on such a purchase for no reason,so I turned and went to look elsewhere, several times.  But I kept going back, so I decided I had to have one of them.  I decided on a cranberry dot noel with a black leather tab closing, I also bought the matching change purse - all for a total, with tax, of $105.76.  The reason they had so much markdown was because it was last season's design, I don't care, I love it, and I haven't bought much for myself in the last 25 years.    Today, I hate when men think just because they're old, that they can wear brown socks and black loafers with shorts and a tee shirt.

      I've been kind of lax about blogging the last couple of days because I've been feeling sad.  I can't explain why, I just felt like crying all the time.  I haven't felt like that since I started on zoloft, so it really worried me about what kind of dark place I'd be in without it.  My mood is beginning to lift, and I have actually had a busy couple of days, and will write about some of my adventures later this evening!  And on a personal note, thank you Erin for your comment, it was like a virtual hug, I really needed it, I love & miss you!

      Well, sometimes you wait and get what you're waiting for, and ither times, like today, some ass buys your suit the night before the coupon becomes valid.  I know, I should have been happy buying a $3000. suit for $459., but I really wanted that extra 30% off.  Next time I'm just going to buy something when I find it.

      Today is Cory's birthday, although we're going to celebrate it when he comes down to NC in 2 weeks.  We called him to wish him a happy day, but his friend, Dante, was there and they were playing video games.  I'm not sure why Dante was invited to spend the day with him, since every time Cory tells us something about school, he's always getting into fights with Dante.  Of course, Cory is a masterful story teller, he gets it from his mom & judy.   Tomorrow, Gini and I are going to Off Fifth when it opens, I have a coupon for 30 percent off any item, and I am going to get a $3000.00, Ralph Lauren Purple Label suit,  that with the discount will be $325!  I hid the suit on Monday, and hope nobody buys it today.  It is just beautiful, perfect for one of Craig's interview suits.  Ugh, I can't believe he is going to be interviewing already.  It was just the other day when he insisted he didn't need me to stay with him at preschool.  Just remember, hold your babies as long as you can, don't strap them in strollers, they grow up way too fast, and then it'll be too late.

      Since moving to North Carolina, 15 years ago, I haven't missed much about Ohio.  Of course, I will always be sorry that I wasn't able to see, or spend enough time with my girls Erin & Katey.  But not much else, except.  I miss is spending 4th of July in Canfield.  They have the greatest 4th celebrations anywhere.  Everyone should try to go there at least once in their lives, it really captures small town life, you can just imagine a Norman Rockwell painting in the making.  So, to Erin, Katey, Laurie, Karl, & Bones- Have a great 4th!  I love you all!

      Another Friday, but no special people coming to town to liven up the weekend.  Gini and Bigguy are heading up to Virginia again tomorrow, to buy tickets for the Mega Millions.  I hope they feel lucky, although Gini and I play Powerball every week, and we haven't won more than a couple of dollars.  I was much luckier playing the lotto in Ohio, but what else was there to do in Ohio except tp spend money on the lottery!?

      Grandma Cooper is 91 today, and of course we went out for another traditional birthday breakfast.  If I make it to 91, I think I would rather go someplace more festive, (Just keep this in mind, all my younger loved ones).  As I'm sitting here, I'm watching ESPN, and reading all the DBB chat sites, waiting to hear more about this Coach K/Lakers thing.  I can't imagine Duke without Coach K, I always thought he'd be there until he retires, just like Dean & that ugly blue team.  Hopefully, this is just some crazy PR thing, I mean, the Lakers came to Durham, K didn't fly into LA.  I do worry though, since one of his daughters live in LA, and also the youngest one has gotten married, he may want to shake his life up some.  He can't leave yet, Lindsey's never seen a game in Cameron.  In case anyone was wondering, Lester is back, and just as wild as ever, although his eyes still look very tired.    Even Frisky came out to greet him with a kiss when we brought him home.

      I know I've been inconsistent with my posts, but with the end of summer visitor time, I hope to get back to my mundane life, and writing about it for everyone, who in most cases know all about my life, to read!  Now, if only the rest of my loved ones would get back to posting too, all will be right with my world.    Just in case anybody didn't know how quickly people age, on our way to South Carolina with Craig and Lindsey, we stopped for a bathroom break at a Hardee's-and since I hate just using a restaurant's facilities without buying anything-I went to the counter to order a drink.  The young, and hopefully blind, clerk, looked right at me, and proceded to ask if I was a senior citizen.  Now, as so many in our family have been reminded by Grandma Cooper lately, I know I'm "no spring chicken", but I had really hoped I would not be asked that question EVER!  If I ever felt the need to later in my life, I would prefer to be the one asking if an establishment gives senior discount, although I really doubt that will ever happen, given my distaste for such a thing.    Today, I hate the phrase "senior citizen".

      I've spent more time at the pool in the past 2 weeks than ever before in my life.  On the upside though, I actually have some color on my legs!  Craig and Lindsey have left the city, and are heading south for a visit.  Hopefully, they will have a safe and comfortable ride.  I can't wait to see them, but I am more ready for Craig to have a phone again-I think he's too ingrained in telecommunicating to be without one, even for 2 days.    I do have a question of the day-  Are all Chepke's shoeaholics, or just the Hungarian-Polish division?  Today, I hate shaving my legs.

      Since Cory & Gary came back to NC, it's been so wild I'm too tired to sit and type out what's been happening.  We are always down at the pool, out to lunch, shopping at malls, or at grocery stores.  Cory doesn't get to go "in" places when he's in Ohio, so we like to keep him doing fun type activities.  Both boys, even with strong sun screen, are turning a beatiful color of brown, and are becoming real water wonders!  We're all waitng, not very patiently, on the impending visit of Craig & Lindsey- Gary can't wait to take a ride in Lindsey's new car!  Gini's waiting to get an ice cream cone, so I better go.  Hopefully, I'll start be posting with more regularity again soon!
