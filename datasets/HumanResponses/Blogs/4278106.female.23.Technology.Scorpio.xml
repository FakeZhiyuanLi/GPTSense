      I became so with drawn this weekend and felt my emotions inspire a jog of a different sort. I gathered my thought and hit the road. I ran with my might only to realise that I couldn't escape the emotions that were rising in me. I stopped to catch breath and found myself trying to catch my emotions. I felt them running without me.  I fell to the ground on my knees and cryed my heart out. I felt so sympathetic to me. For a moment I was looking down on me and this little girl, this beautiful girl who's sees herself thru the eyes of the world could never melt into societies view of normality. Everyday I mourne for the children I could've had. I cryed for 10 minutes. Have I really lost me, my mind. A grown woman crying - sobbing. I wanted his love right then and there. Yet I travel this dessolate rosd day in and day out. Only to discover that this is where I'm supposed to be.  I'm in fear of these emotions. I want to gaze in his eyes in the hope that he would let me in on lifes secrets and clues to finding me. I want him to be my all. Yet my past hurts remind me that - it can't be done. My virginity is his but he doesn't know the extent of my emotions. It scares me how much I've made him my no.1 thought, I think about him twice - Dusk till dawn.  My childhood hurts can never be taken away, not by him, not by his love and certainly not by my wants and belief. I seal this one with depression and push it out to sea.........

      I'm so tired......got too much sleep last night. I was watching the TV and I fell asleep on the couch. I woke up at 01:00 in the morning to find myself seeing images that were dancing in front of my eyes. I closed them just to reasure myself that it was all a dream and I kept on thinking, "What's the deal God?"  Today I'm questioning if working @ the place I'm at is really worth it. I'm traveling 6 hours a day to get here and back, I find myself bieng a front line receptionist, that aint my proffession. Now I feel that I'm bieng undermined and treated like a complete idiot - suppose It's my imagination, however I can't give up. My loyalties always interfere with these cases of feeling unsettled.  I seem to have turned into a person who is constantly questioning things. I have boyfriend - who by the way is in human terms - a hunk, yet I can't find time to spend with him. I'm ending here today, all I want is for things to be the way they are. What's my deal dear God?

      Today is a rather strange day  This DJ - did her duty to the South African community  and handed in a beautiful artist review. Saddest thing is that this artist might turn out to be just like the rest, rush for money, fame. Althou I should hand it to her - her voice is angelic and beautiful. Time will tell.  My boyfriend seems to be going thru mood swings, heck even worse than myne - my excuse is my hormone medication, he's I have no idea. I had so many things to write about this morning and found that there was nobody to E-mail or call. Cause the friendship circle I have is so limited and my passion for music overcomes any wants or needs to have anybody else in my life.  I caught a breath of releaf at the image of me in the mirror, felt I wasn't alive anymore and couldn't grasp the concept of my life for a breaf period of time. Everything is spinning so fast yet slowly altogether @ the same time. Iwant success yet I want it today and not 3 years down the line. I need someone stabding by me, yet not too close to feel my thoughts.  There is plenty I need done, to prove to this 3rd world rated country that I have what it takes, to stand at the top of mount success and say "I worked for this - just so as I can replace the things that God forgot to give me" I am a woman of many talents and gifts, so now I leave to make love to my guitar and let my mind flow with poetry. Today I will smile again. It's not self pitty I give out, but my dreams
