       hey yall! wow... so much drama is goin on right now! somethin to do with cars and shaving cream... but anyways, today has been pretty boring. except for the fact that someone rang my door bell 5 times in a row while just me and my sister were here, and i went to the door and nobody was there... no car, package, or anything! very weird... but yeah, other than that theres nothin really goin on! friday morning was really sad... cause my brother left for vanderbilt and i was upset, cause we are really close and i'm gonna miss him sooo much! but before he left, he gave me a phish t-shirt and sticker, and that was realllly cool of him. friday night was pretty interesting... work was pretty stressful at mojos... but not as much as on saturday! i worked from 10:30 AM to 10:45 PM!!! is that even legal??? i mean, 12 HOURS!! i was soooo worn out... and my mom was like freakin out... haha ooh well! at least i'll have an extremely nice paycheck! :) and i have a new co-worker named erin who is like my identical twin... shes soo awesome and hilarious... and we got to deliver some food to jackson hospital, and she definitely got hit on by a 25 year old male nurse... extremely funny stuff! so work wasnt so bad cause we both got to face paint little kids faces and deliver! my weekend has actually turned out pretty good, even though i thought it was gonna suck because of all the work! and sams finally home soo hes bout to stop by in a lil bit! and then we're gonna go get SnO~BiZ and come back to my house and watch a movie! soo i'm gonna go get ready! have a grand rest of the weekend!! ILU!!      *ReMeMbEr: hard work=large pay!

       Hey yall! This is *My Blog*... I got really bored today and decided to make it! Well, It's Thursday, and my day at school was pretty descent... i had a chemistry test on all the chem. equipment, and i think i did ok on that! soo i was realllly happy about that.. but then close to the end of that class, we all went to do a lab! and it involved putting chemicals under a blue flame! and genius anna burns herself on the hot metal spoon! and now i have a blister on my finger which hurts really bad :( but oooh well... it'll heal soon! sam's bout to come over for a little while and then we're goin over to my grandmothers house for dinner... and then we're goin to the trinity vs. carver practice game which we're gonna get killed in! at least it will be entertaining! and its definitely a good thing that i dont have much homework tonight! i'm gonna go get ready now! have a wonderful rest of the day!      *Always Remember: be careful with hot things, or you might get burned!
