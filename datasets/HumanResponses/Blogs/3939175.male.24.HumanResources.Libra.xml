       urlLink    I think I might have Olympic Fever, I can't stop watching them, and my man Michael Phelps won another gold medal tonight (you go boy). All this talk about swimmers brings back memories of my favorite Olympic swimmer, Greg Louganis. I can't remember why I think he is amazing, but as a boy I had the biggest crush on him, oh, and when he had that interview with Oprah and came out of the closet. I just new one day we would get married, ok not, but still is not just greatest.  Does anyone else get emotional when the Olympics come on or when an American wins a gold medal, I just can't hold back the tears I LOVE AMERICA?   On another note ...... When Does Harmless Cruising get CREEPY?   There is a Target in Fort Lauderdale, that if you go around 8ish, there are more gay couples than straight, and a couple of singles (me). Now, no matter where you go in the store you are bound to get cruised. Singles and couples with wondering eyes, everyone sizing you up. I felt like I was at Cathode Ray for pick a trick night. I saw a cute guy that was cruising me, so I made eye contact and smiled and went about my shopping. He proceeds to follow me over to the electronics section staring and smiling every time I looked up, I thought he was cute, but since I had a long day was not interested in playing this game, so I moved on. I'll be a bottom, if he did follow me down 9 aisles and across to the other side of the store, stopping on the aisle that I was on and acting like he was interested in something on the same aisle. About 15 minutes of this and I was ready to leave the store without my items. Now, I could have said hi and gave him my number, but I was already aggregated with him and wanted him to move on. Ugh, I thought move Creepy Cruiser. In one last desperate attempt to get rid of him I went down the children's aisle and put some diapers in my buggy....he gave me a weird look, I shrugged my shoulders and moved on.... at this point when I looked back he was gone. I continued to shop, and get this he ends up in the same checkout line behind me. He kept looking at my purchases I bet he was wondering (where are the diapers). Anyways, that was just too much for me tonight; after I check out I hurried to my car, as to not see him again in the parking lot. I feel so violated. Have you ever had a moment like this?   urlLink

      I had a great weekend. Aaron is out of town for the conversion, so Jenny and Maggie May stayed with me to keep me company.  We went to a house warming party on Friday night came back watched a few episodes of Sex in the City and went to bed.  Saturday, We watched a few movies and cried....( urlLink The Prince and Me  &  urlLink Love Actually ). I love romantic comedy's, if you have not already seen  urlLink Little Black Book , you must. I give it 2 Thumbs up. After the movies we went shopping at Aventura Mall, OMG, have to go cruising at this mall more, the guys are way hotter than at the Boca Mall. We spotted this hottie in Bloomies and he followed us into Gap, where we lost him, damn it. We are not creepy stalkers, besides he followed us. After a uneventful shopping trip we met my friend Kelly in downtown Hollywood to have dinner and drinks. Downtown Hollywood is cute (Hollywood, FL) I loved it a cute downtown seen with some trendy places to eat. Had a great dinner said our goodbyes and went home.  I am reading  urlLink Naked , by David Sedaris, he is so FUNNY, tried to finish, but I feel asleep.  Today I am at work.....over it, but this is my last CONVERSION so I am so happy. Took us a little over a year to finish the part of the project. Hopefully today will be smooth, until then........

       urlLink    On this weeks episode of the Real World....  Today was not the best of days, got into a huge fight with someone whom I thought was a close friend, but turns out just to be a co-worker. Over the past year I have made so many new relationships with associates on the project. Some of those relationships have turned into great friendships. Some of these friendships I had hoped would last a lifetime, but don't always turn out that way. Life sucks sometimes, but I guess you have to keep rolling with the punches. It is sad sometimes when you invest so much into a person to get nothing in return or to finally see how they really are. I guess you could say her TRUE COLORS shined through brightly today.  Rena and I had a disagreement about how we have treated each other over the past couple of weeks, one of my issues is with her was honesty with me. Her issue is that I have not been treating her very nice the past few days and honestly I have not, because this issue has been eating away at me. So we where down at a co-workers cube visiting and she made a comment about something I said, I turned around and called her a mean word and we went back to our desks. Fifteen minutes later a get a long e-mail that pissed me off, so I wrote back and got everything off my chest, she in return said she is done with me, and that is fine nothing I can do but move on. Sucks when you speak your mind sometimes saying the things people just don't want to hear how they shut off. Honestly, I feel better about the whole thing, I guess some friendships are not worth fighting for.  It is very HARD to maintain some of the friendships on this project only because we work with each other 10 hours a day and since we relocated for this project leaving friends and family forces us to also feel the void of social activates after work. This sometimes is a recipe for a mess, maybe we need some time apart. Well hopefully my day tomorrow will be better, until then...... &nbsp; urlLink

      Well another boring day, not much going on at WORK today. The highlight of the day was Charley turning into a category one Hurricane and its projected path is South FL. Now, before I get excited and host my first Hurricane party, every hurricane that was projected to hit SOUTH FL last year missed us and hit the Carolina's (note to self, don't buy ocean front property in Carolina). So we will see how is pan's out. The good news is that I am a Conversion Analyst, converting over 600 offices to PeopleSoft, well that is not good news but. We have a huge conversion this weekend in which we are converting one of our largest clients (100 Million $ Account), I don't think we are ready, but upper management does not care, so the only thing that might stop this conversion is CHARLEY. Hmm, is it bad to want a Hurricane to hit, I guess I should ask my therapist, I will get back to you guys on that one.  I have a friend in town tonight, she rolled of the project a couple of months ago, and for some reason I am not that excited to see her. NO, it is not that I don't want to see her I just don't want to see some of the people that are going out with us tonight (i.e. evil bitch dog from hell) oops did I type that. Well I am already upset, because we where supposed to go to O'Heras on Las Olas. Now, it is one thing to go out and have drinks with 20 straight co-workers, and have a gay bar right down the street so when I am drunk I can sneak out and go flirt with GAY MEN. My co-workers don't understand, but who cares, anyways. To my dismay they fuckin changed the venue, to some trashy bar called Fox and the Hound, ewww, who would want to go there anyways. So who is the bitch that did not want to go to O'Heras, well it was Gayla so I am not going to hate, I might just not show up so there. I just don't understand the straights sometimes.

      My 25th Birthday is just right around the corner, Sept 23rd to be exact and I read this the other day and can totally relate to it right now in my life....  "Being Twenty-Something"     They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't.One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you.Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap.Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision.You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself...and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it.We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.

      OK, so here I am in South Florida, Fort Lauderdale to be exact. South Florida is not my home; I came down here from Dallas for a company project that was supposed to be over in April of 2004. We are now approaching 2005, with little light at the end of the tunnel. I am not complaining I am setup in a good situation that most would die for. They pay for 2 trips home a month (home for wherever I Choose in the US), pay for company car and gas, pay for food and my apartment. My only complaint is that I get bored easy. We have a lot of down time right now, and searching the internet and reading blogs can only take up so much of the day, then there is a 2-hour lunch, I read my yahoo listing, then I guess you could call me a cubicle whore, I make my rounds about 3 times a day. I go from cubicle to cubicle and try to have interesting conversion, but it is hard when I am gay and very focused on my interests only. No, I mean I care about straight people I do, but sometimes they just don't understand my interests nor do I want to understand them, when I can barley understand myself.  I lucked out with this position, because it just so happens that my Best Friend also works for the same company and got the position also, so he is here with me as my home away from home, my sister, my gay bar hoping sista BritBrit. What would I do without her, maybe get some sleep, but it would not of been half as fun as she makes it. More stories about her to come, she is a mess, but I love her.  I really wished I had started this journal a year ago; I have so much to catch up on. Oh lord where do I begin, I call these chronicles “Tragic Moments in South Florida.  #1 August 4th 2003 we leave for Fort Lauderdale for the start of the project. So BritBrit meets me at the airport LATE, I get so stressed about getting to the airport late especially since 9/11 it takes FOREVER to get through security.  She shows up in ripped up Hollister Jeans, flip flops, a gay t-shirt, with a sweater tied around his waist, Marilyn Monroe shades, and this is the best part, with his Winnie the Pooh Bear in his arms smacking his gum like he is Britney Spears.  I am like we need to be professional here, who knows how many people we will meet that are flying in for the project. I am the uptight one and she is the relaxed one with not a care in the world.  This is the first time I have had to travel for work and it was very rushed, we both forgot to make our car reservations, and just figured we could just get them once we got into Lauderdale. Well, we land, get to the car rental place and the reservation system is down. It is now 6pm Sunday night, we wanted to get settled in and have a restful nights sleep before we meet everyone on Monday.  They assure us the system will be up soon, so we wait. 9pm roles around and we are still waiting, we decide to take a taxi to the hotel and unpack, then come back when the system is back up. The car rental place feels so bad they want to give us a courtesy ride to the hotel, hold on while we get a driver for you, 10:30pm roles around and we are in route to our hotel and as we pull into the hotel my cell phone rings and amex travel tells me they have made us another reservation with someone else and we can now pick up our cars now. We turn around, go back to the airport and wait in another long line, but by 11:30pm we have out rentals and are back on our way to the Westin Fort Lauderdale, on the website the market there Heavenly Beds and that was the only thing that was on my mind at this time. We walk into the hotel all tore up looking from waiting for hours on end, as the cute bell boy is trying to figure out why we have 9 large bags, and why I keep staring at him and his chest, he loads the bags and takes us to the room. While in route we spot a total hottie, I mean muscle from head 2 toe, gorgeous face with a great smile. BritBrit and I are laughing and being loud to bring as much attention to ourselves as we can, to try and figure out if he is gay. Well we get in the elevator and I make the comment about my company and Hottie says oh you guys are here for the project, I am like great see I told you we should of dressed less gay. We chatted him up a bit and retired to our rooms, we spent almost an hour deciding if he was gay or not, turns out he is not, but likes to experiment. So I am thinking, ok so we can get him drunk, nope he is a recovering alcoholic, damn it. A year later he is a total sweetheart and has become a great friend. This is my first Tragic Moment in South FL. More to come……
