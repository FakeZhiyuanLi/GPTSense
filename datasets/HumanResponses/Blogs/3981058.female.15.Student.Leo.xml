        It's so amzing how i managed to have another blog. This is actually my 5th blog. yep. my 5th! BUT... only 2 blogs are active.. the rest are probably deleted or inactive already... my other blog w/c is in blogdrive... is intended to upd8 my friends on what's up w/ me.. this blog is intended to be more private. In short.. none of my friends knew about this blog... and even if they&nbsp;will... i just hope that they'd consider some stuffs here a secret...   Anyhow... i just downloaded the new MSN messenger 6.2! after it was installed... I was able to talk to my cousin in Canada... together with her friend Erin... we didn't&nbsp;talk&nbsp;that much since I'm quite bc with my&nbsp;homeworks... we just said our hellos and advance happy birthdays to each other... She'll be celebrating her birthday on Aug.13&nbsp;in Watermania... w/c i guess is a swimming party... she actually invited me.. but being there would be very impossible because I have classes and I'm in the Philippines! Going to Canada would be very difficult. But I really wish i could go..   &nbsp;  Anyways... I've been online for 3 hours now... aside from researching some stuffs... I'm going to send my 'bestfriend' an email... she's actually a friend whom i consider my bestfriend because i'm closer to her than any of my friends. Anyways, the reason i'm sending her an email 'letter' is because she gave me a palanca letter last thursday for our class recollection although i didn't asked her to make me one. The letter was so sweet and long! mangiyak-ngiyak na nga ako eh! haha!! but seriously... it was really sweet. i didn't really thought she could make something like that because she's known to be super hyper and a happy-go-lucky type of person w/c i think had no time to be super serious. Pero she proved me wrong...  &nbsp;  Yesterday, we had our training from 2-5pm... thank God! the rain stopped during those hours... but my shoes and pants were all covered with mud! But it's okay.. it's part of the training. The worst part was when we had the last drill.. it's sort of a game and the consequence for the losing team would be crawling&nbsp;under the winning team. Unfortunately. my team lost the game and we have to crawl under the winning team w/c is composed of at least 8 members who were sort of 10in. apart from each other! Just imagine the long crawl in the mud!!!!
