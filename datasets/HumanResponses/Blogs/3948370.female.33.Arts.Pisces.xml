       urlLink    These are the Days! Megan and I went out for a "mommy and me" day. This is my chance to spoil my daughter for absolutely no reason. It sounds like a scary thing to give&nbsp;complete control&nbsp;of an entire afternoon to an 8 year old- but it's nice to see her step up and lead the way. She even brought her own money and offered to pay. What a sweetheart! Her choices included visiting her&nbsp;previous school & friend, going to the mall, riding the carousel, teddycrafters, Gap Kids and Jamba Juice.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's her&nbsp;day and she's in charge. It's a parents duty to empower their children, isn't it?&nbsp;I asked her on the car ride home, "did I spoil you today?" she said "no mommy, you just made me happy." I love my dear sweet Megan.

      I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear."&nbsp; -Joan Didion   "The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed."&nbsp; -Carl &nbsp;Jung   &nbsp; When I think of him... When my thoughts return to him a smile&nbsp;sweeps&nbsp;across my face. No matter what my trouble or mood may be he&nbsp;becomes my&nbsp;pleasant peace.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;beauty in him that I ponder in the&nbsp;safety of my mind. He resides in the place I have created for him and him alone...

       urlLink    I like to go up on the roof. Watch the sunset. Thank God for this mysterious world. What am I in the vast universe? Does he really know how many hairs I have on my head? How am I different than anyone else? I am free from self torment- or so I'd like to think. We are all born, we live a little while, than we die. Charlotte understood that. I like myself and that's important. I didn't used to.

      Who is Annie Fanny?  Soon you'll know- Like the Russian girl in Moscow yelling "Mom look! It's Harry Potter!" The Asian boy in Tokyo pleading to eat at McDonalds. She's the sad girl you didn't notice. About to find a brand new world with familiar faces. Annie Fanny. Her name says it all. Go ahead and tease her- everyone does. Unless you feel the pain of guilt that hurting another person brings. Better yet, get to know her. She's funny, cute, smart and above all- a good friend. Could you be all that? Consider leaving the Earth's atmosphere by accident. Your father being charged with your murder. Finding out there is life on other planets and gee- they look just like you! Thank God, because in this world "Fanny" is not a slang word for "butt".  Who is Annie Fanny? just my idea- my story- my dream

      I've been reading some of the blogs on this site. I like to write so I found another user who lists the same interest. He likes to write? Write what? Every other word is vulgar. I don't understand it? Is it just a low intellect that causes some to stick with familiar terms? Can their minds not comprehend the possibility of multiple means of expression? Money has nothing to do with it, so don't give me that bull- the poor are all stupid. I disagree. That's a lame excuse. Whatever... :)  I do however, see a correlation between swearing and the slammer. Keep that motor runnin and you'll be seein bars! Tell me, do they blog in jail?

       urlLink     Monday Aug. 2, 2004 was one of those days when you love to be a parent. Prepared with music, games and books, Katie & Megan were ready to spend the next couple of hours sitting in the waiting room at Carmax. Sliding down a 3 story tube filled with cool water lived only in their summertime dreams. The shock and disbelief that spread across those faces when I turned left into the sunsplash parking lot gave this parent pure joy. "Did I say Carmax? I meant Sunsplash." It took a few seconds, but it soon sank in that mom wasn't trying to torture them. She really means it. We're going to Sunsplash! Now I'm not much of a dare devil rider- but I must admit, those rides are fun!

      Don't tell me, SHOW me the air is thick with mist, the girl is in pain, the water is cold. Don't make me stumble.   Through a slow moving haze, a small dark figure appears to rise right out of the water. It's left side seems to be brighter than the rest, like a lighthouse warning it's guests of danger. "Is it land?" Annie wonders as she struggles to swim despite the 2 inch gash in her right shoulder. She feels her blood spilling away while her muscles grow stiff from the sting of the fridged water.       notes to self: figure is how small? compare size to something. Describe all her senses. What does she hear? Is it night or day?
