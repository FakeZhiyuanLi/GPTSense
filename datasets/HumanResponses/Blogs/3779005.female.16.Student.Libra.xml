      Yesterday was Polish premiere of "Shrek2". Evil_girl, my sister and I went to Katowice to watch it. Everything was done in hurry. Of course no "adventures" were avoided. We got off on the wrong tramstop, tresspassed main and the most dangerous street in Katowice, meet my Mom to take money for tickets :> went to "The Helios Cinema" were there were no tickets left on the 8pm. and 9pm. show, so decided to go to "The Cinema City". When we got there, it was 5 to 8pm. so we thought if there were no tickets left on "Shrek2", we would go on "Harry Potter and the Prioner of Azkaban" (although my sister and I have already seen it :P). To our surprise there were tickets on "Shrek2"! Show started on 8.30pm (although it was supposed to begin at 8pm :P) and finished about 9.45pm. We had a tram to Bytom at 10.12pm. and came back home at 11.15pm. My Mom was angry, because I have time to 10pm always becuase this is very dangerous region and this was a "little bit late".  But I saw Shrek2 on it's premiere-day and I'm happy :) Earlier that day I went shopping with Evil_girl to Tarnowskie GÃ³ry (I didn't mean that in Bytom we have no shops, but we have been to all and seen nothing that we liked). I bought black sport-shoes and a bikini :>

      I shall write something about me and my life as I promised last time :) I'm Annie, I'm 17. I like drinking beer with my friends and love music, escpecially rock, hard rock, metal, punk, hard core etc. I've got a dog. Her name's Vega :) I live in Bytom, on Silesia. I must say it's rather ugly town, but people in here are wonderful! :) On Monday we went to the Zoo in Chorzow. Evil_girl, Jo, Kora and me. Observing animals is great especially if it is smart monkey reaching out it's hands to us for biscuits or 2-month old lemurs playing on their little isle. They were really great! They jumped in so funny way :) We also loved a donkey. It was alone in the end of the zoo with no grass on it's farm so we decided to pick some grass for it. Some became a lot :P I think it had hay in building on it's farm, but hay is not as tasty as grass :) Great were also "timons" - if you've watched "the lion king" you should remember Timon, little Simba's friend. I wrote "timons" because I don't know how "surykatka" is in English :P We also spent some time trying to lure a little black cat from the bushes, but he didn't want to come out of there. After visit to the zoo, we went on cable railway named "Elka". It's "the only lowland cable railway in Central Europe" :>
