      she called me finally but because of wat i said.. she sound distant.. i think to her calling me is juz a chore.. like wat she said she had to meet me once a week.. it;s like routine.. not of free will.. i hope we can really go out this weekend.. hope she doesnt have anything on last min. but wat i hope most is that she wants to meet me cos she wans to and not because of promising that. i want her to be with me not somewhere else thinking bout that somebody of hers. think i wun be able to sleep for sometime.. wats the human limit? ha.. i'll noe soon enough.

      today's the worst day yet... sunday a day planned ahead to spend with...but as it shows i'm second to her "friend". Boy was i heartbroken, but it doesnt seem to affect her at all.. so going out to buy camping supplies is more important than spending the only one day of the entire week with me? does she love me? i ponder before a YES.. Cos love is about sacrificing, so here i am an offering to love. well i watched spidyman II juz.. haha.. ironically it shows us that in life u will not always get and achieve wat u dream for.. but love is not juz about taking.. like MJ she chose to risk her future for love, ha.. maybe that only happens in movies well i believe that its not true cos love is AMAZING.
