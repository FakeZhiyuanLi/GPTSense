         The Dancing Trees  The blowing winds confound the trees Into blowing in every direction As gray clouds begin to gather And the sky darkens almost to black The storms descend in a fury of sound Thunder crashes as lightning flickers Rain pelts the thirsty canyons of soil While we stand outside, our faces raised Laughing and dancing the rain dance    &nbsp; Freezing  The cold slides up when it’s least expected Raising goose bumps up and down your arms The hair on your head rises up and almost leaves Slowly eating away at your body Leaving the discomforts of live And you: completely vulnerable and only yourself   Summer  Summer creeps up with the yearning of winter past Lifts the sky on fluffy clouds Rolls the earth in a glowing sun Takes away life and gives even more   Tree in a City  A world of machines, roads like snakes Buildings rising like mountains Above the ants of the gods Creators of the new world Lords of others Gods themselves Held in high esteem—none are greater than they A vision of cities Nature’s touch leaving Falling into shadow Into night A day filled with darkness and artificial light A memory not easily forgotten Holding the minds eye Stretching from horizon to world’s end Filling the soul Holding tight Never letting go of the center Reaching as high as possible Ever stretching toward the sky Holding to the ground Caught between flight and falling Silently standing Defying law Waiting for the justice of release Reaching beyond the dreams of men   Reborn  A shadow of a universe Spinning round twisting turning Holding fast to what is gone shaking shivering Living in a storm of fire of death Clearing the world of the old and sick New growth sprouts from waste the Forgotten the Life   Extinguished  So young and lively Seemingly without a flaw So much life not yet lived All the beauty they never saw   Falling Down  When the wold is falling down And you don’t know what to do You back’s not strong enough to hold his up Waiting for a time When you won’t be alone Sitting here and wishing dreams away  Singing songs of past Songs of memories Living life from back to front Seeking solace That you’ll never find Knowing life’s only what you make of it    &nbsp; Simply Love  Closed eyes Content Surrounded by arms Enfolded in warmth Smiling sleepily Staring into endless skies Eyes of love Of simplicity Of feeling Of belonging    &nbsp; Dragon Flight  A glorious sight The flight of a dragon Lord of the sky Not all claws and teeth With beautiful scales Colors to match the mood Freedom wrapped up in a coil Tongue flickering with the devil’s grin Eyes laughing the world smiles back Awed by grace seen when skies part A legend to match your swelling heart   Free  The wind ripples across the plains The grass a green sea The sky an ocean of possibilities Flying high unhindered   My Love  A tree fully nurtured It touched the very sky Full branches, large green leaves Roots reaching deep to the center of my heart  A healthy tree It stood by itself Needing only feelings to sustain Feeding off good vibes from time spend together  Then you came With your innocent face Swinging your axe of separation One chop, two chops, harsh words and it feel  One small sprout Remained in the center Of the tree that once was Hanging on, wishing to live despite the destruction  There you stayed Withering new love In your shadow of hate Shrinking inside of me away from cruel thoughts  Ever strong The seedling clung To life and itself:&nbsp; love And so it remained, but never grew for lack of care  Again you came With a bucket of water And doused the poor little tree Who was more hurt than helped by your generous offer  Still shriveled Afraid to grow But daring to hope Waiting to be uprooted or, maybe, helped  Help came After waiting unsure He came again and offered What was need all along by one poor heart  Now it grows Slowly, scared still For the life came from destruction And past wrongs are slowing healing as the tree matures

       It's raining again. The sky is emptying itself and the thunder's so loud. It's as dark as night. The rain sounds so beautiful, pattering upon the world. Everything has a musty, damp smell. The sky seems to split from the bright lightning and deafening thunder. The pine tree in our yard glistens in the rain. It's dark enough the street lights have come on. There is another smell in the air. Is it smoke? Sirens sound in the distance. Maybe the lightning has started a fire. A car drives past with it's window down. Do they notice? I'm sure the fat raindrops have reminded the driver what being wet feels like. All the while flashes of lightning lace through the sky as it grumbles and occasionally shouts to remind you it hasn't left yet. A large flash of lightning lights the sky and, even though the sky grumbles in the distance, I can feel the tension, an absence of sound, as if the whole sky is waiting for the thunder. With a few more angry cries the storm receeds into the distance and true dark settles in. There will be no sunset tonight.   Inside the house smells of damp cat litter, or maybe it's just frightened and drooling dog. The departing storm is a whisper now and the artificial lights can only just hold back the dark that seemed so comforting outside. We hide beside our little lights, just like we hide fromthe storm under our roofs. How many times do people actually get soaked, wet to the bone, when it rains? Only little children or those young at heart seem to enjoy the thought of dancing in the rain. We become so acustomed to being protected. Hiding is so easy when you think of facing the storm.
