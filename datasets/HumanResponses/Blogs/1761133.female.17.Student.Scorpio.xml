      This is how i exactly feel...  Scorpio October 23 - November 21 You may feel as if you are running into a brick wall at every turn, dear Scorpio, especially when it comes to your emotions. The intensity of the day may have you feeling like you are in a pressure cooker. Try not to blow the situation out of proportion. Work to keep the lid on. Realize that much of the drama is more a figment of your imagination than actual reality. Clear away the clouds and get to the heart of the matter.

      Scorpio October 23 - November 21 It is extremely important for you to not be too possessive today - especially when it comes to other people, dear Scorpio. You have extremely important relationships with the people around you, and you will find that in order to maintain these relationships, it is best to let those people live their lives the way they want. Do not adopt the false impression that people belong to you, because they don't.

      Sounds so like me...don't you think?  Scorpio October 23 - November 21 An unpleasant situation may arise to which your first reaction is to protect those closest to you from the truth. You may be tempted to lie about it, or at least avoid mentioning the situation. Don't give in to the temptation, however, dear Scorpio. Your desire to shield those you love is understandable - but could lead to upsets in the future. There are things you can't protect people from forever, and most people prefer to know the facts.

      This horoscope kind of freaked me out...is it trying to tell me something...hmmm...let us ponder for a minute...  Scorpio October 23 - November 21 Strange passionate stirrings within you could find you wanting to escape to somewhere away from civilization with a lover, dear Scorpio. This is a great day to do so. At the very least plan a quiet evening at home with the special someone in your life. You might also want to satisfy other sensual cravings, such as a desire for delicious food or drink, or for comfortable chairs or beds. Flow with it. We all need a little self-indulgence now and then!

      Now I will tell you what I've done for you... 50 thousand tears i've cried. Screaming, deceiving, and bleeding for you, And you still won't hear me.  Don't want your hand this time i'll save myself; Maybe I'll wake up for once, Not tormented daily defeated by you, Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom, I'm dying again.  I'm going under, Drowning in you. I'm falling forever, I've got to break through, I'm going under.  Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies, So I don't know what's real and what's not. Always confusing the thoughts in my head, So I can't trust myself anymore, I'm dying again.  I'm going under, Drowning in you. I'm falling forever, I've got to break through.  So go on and scream, Scream at me I'm so far away, I won't be broken again, I've got to breathe I can't keep going under!  Song by Evanesence

      "Away From The Sun" It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  Can anyone do what I've done  I missed life  I missed the colours of the world  Can anyone go where I am   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun again  Away from the sun again   I'm over this  I'm tired of living in the dark  Can anyone see me down here  The feeling's gone  There's nothing left to lift me up  Back into the world I've known   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again   It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  And now I can't do what I've done   And now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again

      I'm sure it wasn't my fault, but it's hard not to blame yourself for someone else's death. This will be the second Christmas without my father, and it hurts to see that no one sees that I'm in pain, and will always be in pain. I'm suffering everyday from a disease called depression and no one is really there for me (except one person). I thank that one person for being there for me always and forever.

      Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark, For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart, To weave by picking up the pieces that remain, Melodies of life - love's lost refrain.   Our paths they did cross, though I cannot say just why. We met, we laughed, we held on fast, and then we said goodbye. And who'll hear the echoes of stories never told ? Let them ring out loud till they unfold.   In my dearest memories, I see you reaching out to me. Though you're gone, I still believe that you can call out my name.   A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life, To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and beyond.   So far and away, see the birds as it flies by. Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky. I've laid my memories and dreams upon those wings. Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings.   In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me ? Was it fate that brought us close and now leave me behind ?   A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life, To the sky beyond the flying bird - forever and on.   If I should leave this lonely world behind, Your voice will still remember our melody. Now I know we'll carry on. Melodies of life, Come circle round and grow deep in our hearts, as long as we remember.  "Melodies of Life" FFIX

      You were the one  Who I could tell my deepest fears And you were the one  Who always wiped away my tears  When he hurt me you were my prince  Sent straight from above Like a fool I never saw  You were falling in love  So now I’ve lost everything Cause now you say  You’re gone forever more So who will I  Who will I run to  Who will I turn to Now that you left me behind Who will dry my tears  When I cry Who will I run to  And who will I turn to Now that you’re not here  In my life  You were the one  I took for granted all those years And you were the one  I should’ve known It was so clear  How could I be so blind  Not to see what’s before my eyes I’ll get you back here with me If it takes the rest of my life  Cause I would do anything Cause I want you back forever more  Who will I run to  Who will I turn to Now that you left me behind Who will dry my tears  When I cry Who will I run to  And who will I turn to Now that you’re not here  In my life  I will gladly journey  Across the deep blue sea If I could know  That I would have you here with me I realize that I was blind  But now I finally see I need you back here in my life Oh baby can it be  Who will I run to Who will I turn to Now that you left me behind Who will dry my tears When I cry Who will I run to  Who will I turn to Now that you’re not here  In my life  Who will be there for me Who’s gonna rescue me Who’s gonna share my dreams Who’s gonna mend this broken heart  "Who Will I Run To?" by Kiley Dean

      Your superpower is superspeed  Think fast! Your hidden superpower is SUPER SPEED! Some people might think you have a talent for impatience, but we like to call it efficiency. You approach all things with a need for speed. Whether it's running a race, eating lunch, or writing a report, you finish the task in no time flat. This quality is a huge asset in today's hotwired workplace, where there's never enough time to do anything. With a little bit of practice, you'll soon be zipping about the office, zooming between social engagements, and devouring books at an alarming rate. Your friends and coworkers won't be able to keep up. If you use your powers wisely, you'll be the model of well-balanced productivity. But don't forget: Ultra-speedy superheroes have to take good care of their bodies. Be sure to eat right, get plenty of sleep and stretch regularly. Are you ready? Invest in some quality shoes and hop to it. You'll be flying through your day in no time.

      Your lucky number is two  "Best Friends Forever," Number 2. As the Helper, you probably got more BFFs in your yearbook than most. Everyone thinks you're just the bee's knees. And why wouldn't they? You always buy the thoughtful gifts, complete with wrapping paper and maybe that cute kitten card that says, "Hang in there." But what it should really say is "I want love, too... and presents...and cards with kittens." Sometimes you try to be too much to too many people, yet you want to maintain separate groups. Yes, you Type 2s get a little high on the fumes of your own popularity, and when you start to come down it can be quite the bummer. Possessiveness, dependency, jealousy, and that's just before breakfast. You're at your finest when your motives are pure. Ahhhh, you feel that? That's the soft touch of unconditional love. And that's what you and famous 2s, Bill Cosby, Pavarotti, and Ann Landers do best.

      Your sense of humor is sarcasm  Oh yeah, you're really funny. (Actually you are, but you're so sarcastic that it's hard to tell when you're joking.) You mean what you say, but almost never say exactly what you mean. In fact you usually say the exact opposite. For instance, if your friend is wearing an ugly watch, you might tell them, "I wanted a watch like that once, but I got the wrong Happy Meal." Yep, there's a slight edge to your humor, but all you are really doing is telling it like it is, only like it's not.  Whether you're roasting a friend or playing social critic, your deadpan delivery and dry cynicism go a long way to expressing your true feelings...and making people laugh along the way.

      Are you evil?  Good for you, you're human. We all have evil thoughts, and you may have acted on a few of yours, but you're probably okay traveling through Buffy's turf. Or maybe you're an aspiring evil person and you've never given yourself a real chance. Go ahead and forgive yourself for the mean-spirited � but ultimately harmless � pranks you pulled in grade school. Whispering behind your co-workers' backs won't flood you with bad karma. And we've all held out for ourselves in the throes of passion a time or two. So keep listening to that conscience of yours, but don't worry about tuning it out every so often. Keep reading for more evil details!  In the bedroom, you don't have an evil bone in your body � well maybe one, but ... aw, never mind. The moral lessons you learned as a child really stuck � we have a sneaking suspicion you're still haunted by the ghost of your parents' first sex lecture ("Heavy petting won't make you popular"). In bed, you're as generous as they come � you always put your partner's needs ahead of yours. And your bedroom is a sacred temple. Overall, you're an enlightened sexual wonder. Just remember, it's okay to go nuts on your birthday.  Okay, admit it � sometimes you'd rather avoid face-to-face conflict. Now, was telling us that to our face so hard? No. Being up front about any concerns as soon as you have them, rather than letting them build up and turn into, say, a tire-slashing incident, is a good thing. And it sure beats getting a reputation as someone with a taste for revenge. Sure, you probably wouldn't make a very good bouncer, but that's okay. Take comfort from the fact that, overall, we think you're just swell.  We're not going to say you're a bad person, but you're toeing the line. A little advice: Try to think about how your victim will feel before you pull your next dirty prank (we don't care how funny it is when you take out a classifed ad and sell someone's car for them). You may think cruelty is funny, but your friends don't � especially the ones who've been burned by your verging-on-evil ways. Listen to your conscience a little more, okay?

      Your destiny is to be a Provider   Whether you know it or not, this is the role that is most in tune with who you are at your core. As a Provider, you have a genuine nurturing concern for the welfare of others and you're eager to serve them. You can recognize exactly what people need and your friendly, helpful, social nature makes them feel comforted. With your kind and generous heart, you are personable, talkative, and outward with your emotions, and your openness and sensitivity makes you concerned about the way others view you. Along these lines, be careful not to blame yourself when things go wrong. You cannot prevent bad things from happening, even though your tendency to be orderly with a strong sense of right and wrong may lead you to believe you can. Accept that you do what you can to take care of things and that this will get you far in the world.

      Your song is Walking On Sunshine  Your upbeat approach to life makes "Walking on Sunshine" the perfect anthem for you. We can see you dancing down the vegetable isle with your grocery cart, smiling at all the checkout clerks. We sure hope you've had your Wheaties to keep up with your perky pace all day long. This happy, horn-driven tune carries you to work every day. And even in those brief lapses when you're not fully on your game, "Walking On Sunshine" seems to put things in perspective and get you back to your super groove. "And don't it feel good?" Who cares that this tune was a one-hit wonder for Katrina and the Waves? Even that quality matches your one-of-a-kindness. You're walkin' on sunshine and spreading it wherever you go.

      Your dog breed is Chihuahua  No bones about it, you're an energetic, devoted Chihuahua. For your breed, size definitely doesn't matter. After all, sometimes the best things (diamonds, car keys, Godiva truffles) come in small packages. Honest and straightforward, you're never afraid to speak up for what you believe in, especially if it's a cause near and dear to your heart. Having such a passionate personality can come with a few drawbacks, though. You can be moody at times, and people often find it hard to live up to your high standards. But once you make a friend, it's for life. Saucy and intense, your energy and unfailing loyalty make you a great companion. Woof!

      Your passion is Bashful Blush  Yours is a passion driven from the inside — not the outside. Some may misinterpret that to mean you're more timid than others when it comes to love, school, and life in general. But really, we suspect it's just that you focus more on driving toward your goals than announcing them to the world. While some people have to stand at a podium to stake their territorial claims — on guys, teams, or the honor roll — you're more likely to take a less direct route. (After all, it's easier to make your point when you're not caught like a deer in the spotlight.) A level-headed discussion with someone close to your issue, if not the person directly, is more your style — whether feeling out if your crush is already taken or asking your parents for a much-deserved raise in allowance. Your careful approach usually pans out better than creating a dramatic scene before a gawking audience. Sure, you go after what you want in life. But your style has never been to grab the bull by the horns. The patience you've cultivated has no doubt helped you become who you are today — a devoted friend, daughter, girlfriend, or student. So keep at it — picking your private battles. Then stand back to watch your bashful blush work its passionate magic!

      Where once was light Now darkness falls Where once was love Love is no more Don't say goodbye Don't say I didn't try  These tears we cry Are falling rain For all the lies you told us The hurt, the blame! And we will weep to be so alone We are lost We can never go home  So in the end I'll be what I will be No loyal friend Was ever there for me  Now we say goodbye We say you didn't try  These tears you cry Have come too late Take back the lies The hurt, the blame!  And you will weep When you face the end alone You are lost You can never go home You are lost  You can never go home  "Gollum's Song" The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers Sung by Emiliana Torrini

      I follow the night Can't stand the light When will I begin To live again?  One day I'll fly away Leave all this to yesterday What more could your Love do for me? When will Love be through with me?  Why live life from dream to dream? And dread the day when dreaming ends  One day I'll fly away Leave all this to yesterday Why live life from dream to dream? And dread the day when dreaming ends  One day I'll fly away Fly, fly away  "One Day I'll Fly Away" Moulin Rouge Sung by Nicole Kidman

      Lay down Your sweet and weary head The night is falling You have come to journey's end Sleep now And dream of the ones who came before They are calling From across the distant shore  Why do you weep? What are these tears upon your face? Soon you will see All of your fears will pass away Safe in my arms You're only sleeping  What can you see On the horizon? Why do the white gulls call? Across the sea A pale moon rises The ships have come to carry you home  And all will turn To silver glass A light on the water All Souls pass  Hope fades Into the world of night Through shadows falling Out of memory and time Don't say We have come now to the end White shores are calling You and I will meet again And you'll be here in my arms Just sleeping  Chorus  And all will turn  To silver glass A light on the water Grey ships pass  Into the West  "Into the West" The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King By Annie Lennox

      Scorpio October 23 - November 21 You may be feeling extra self-confident today, dear Scorpio, making you more able to say and do the things that you might normally keep inside. Be warned, however, that you are apt to run into some powerful unexpected opposition. The genius in you wants to come out and show others what you are made of, but other people may find reason to find fault. Don't let the disapproval of others hinder your progress.

      Tis a sad thing to see when people go array, When they feel like that they have to die. I can understand that your heart became sore, Cause I've had those feelings many times before. It's hard to figure out, When you really want to shout, That no one really cares, That no one wants to share. But how can you not be loved, When you know you can't be shoved, Into doing something stupid Or something very putrid. The choice you make is yours, There are many open doors And lights to show the way; So now you know you're ok.  "Second thoughts" By Me

      I'm praying to you God and trust me, I never pray to you, ever. I am in fear for some peoples lives: my best friend and a girl who goes to our school (If you haven't heard the story or see what was going on at school today, ask me later). They both feel that they shouldn't be exsisting in this world. I have had those feelings before, but one was on the verge and one actually tried to take thier own life. I hope that they can find the strength to live, because nothing is worse than losing someone to suicide. It pains me to see that some people feel useless and unworthy when they know that they play a role in this world. So if you hear this, I hope you give them some lee-way. They are all loved by somebody and they should know this. But if they are feeling down about something, they shouldn't have to think death is the only way out.

      Scorpio (astrology), the eighth sign of the zodiac, symbolized by a scorpion. According to astrologers, people whose birthdays fall between October 23 and November 21 are born under the sun sign of Scorpio. The planet Pluto rules Scorpio, which is a water sign.  Astrologers consider Scorpios to be energetic, passionate, deep, intuitive, and secretive, with a great deal of self-control. They also believe that Scorpios can be willful, stubborn, and easily made jealous. Scorpios are thought to be keen observers of people, and potentially calculating and manipulative. Seeing more of people's deepest motivations than others do, they have a tendency to be cynical. They are sensitive and never forget a hurt or a slight—for the typical Scorpio, forgiveness can be difficult.  Astrologers consider Scorpio perhaps the most extreme of all signs. The intensity and focus of Scorpios gives them great ability to see a project through despite all obstacles. Their strong leadership qualities, incisive analytic abilities, energy, and desire for financial security can make them motivated career people. Many Scorpios also like to flirt with danger and push themselves and those close to them to their limits. Professions traditionally associated with Scorpio include forensics, law enforcement or detective work, the military, medicine, psychology, big business, and recycling.

      I suggest you read this WHOLE story before you can call me names... And I think I should tell my story before you start to judge me...   I'm starting from what I can remember from July 3, 2001. Actually it started way before. My father and mother were constantly fighting. My mom and dad once in a while would come to me and ask my opinion on them getting a divorce. Of course I hated the idea. My mom told me that my dad had a problem; a problem with money. I didn't understand her at first, but afterwards, I knew. She also told me that "they" were going to take me and my brother away. Later did I found out that "they" was the government, because apparently the money problem somehow involved us. This is just the beginning though. My older brother and my dad had problems. I don't know what kind, but it always ended in a fit and crying. I would cry every night because I lived in what I would call a demented family.  On July 2, 2001 was my fathers birthday. My younger brother, me, and my father went out driving in the country just because it's kind of a "thing" we did. But this time we almost drove to Iowa, which scared me for some reason. I had a gut wrenching feeling the whole day. We went back to Rochester and decided to eat at the restaurant "Grandma's Kitchen" to celebrate my fathers birthday. Then we went home and my dad went to one of his daily meetings. My older brother had lock himself into his room, trying to avoid my dad. Once he knew my dad was out, he packed his bags and left. It was his running away from home. I was in the shower at the time; I got my info from my little brother. My dad didn't get back till after I was in bed, like 10-ish. He came into my room because he found out my older brother wasn't home. He was turning beet red; it's either because he was mad or about to cry. He asked me where he went. I said I didn't know. My little brother told me that he left with a guy, one of his friends I'm guessing, so that's what I told him.  The next morning was Wednesday, July 3. I was awake but sleeping at the same time. I heard a weird kind of choking noise. I thought it was my older brother coming home and crying into my dad's arm. But it was my dad crying. He kept saying he was gone, he was gone and I knew he was talking about my older brother because he never came home. Then my dad came to my room and sat on my bed and said "You know that I love you, don't you?". I just sat there and nodded. Those were the last words he said to me. My dad got up and got dressed. My mom was worried he would do something stupid. He was telling her not to worry. Then the phone rang. It was my brother. My dad went outside to talk to him. He was asking him to come home. Their conversation ended and my dad said he was going out. My mom begged him to stay. He still went, and that was the last time I saw him.  My mom was so scared that she had to call the police and told us to pack our bags. We were going to leave the house that I've been living in for the longest time. Then the police came. They were asking my mom questions and stuff. One of them came up to me and asked me how I was and stuff like that. Then she told us to go downstairs. I didn't know what was going on. My little brother was so upset that he couldn't stop crying. I told him everything would be OK. It was a very long time till anyone got us. It was my older brother who came to get us. I was so glad to see him, but that was my two seconds of happiness. We went into our living room and there were all these people I've never seen before. I went and sat next to my mom. One of the police men kind of looked up and said straight forward "Your dad has passed away." I burst into tears right after he said "away". That was the hardest and longest I've ever cried. I thought that I would never here those words until my dad was really old. But at fifteen years of age, I heard them. I found out that my dad committed suicide; that he threw himself under a moving train. No one told me, so I had to find out from the newspaper. I've never been happy since.   Because of my dads death, we had to deal with his money problem. He was over $10,000 in debt. We had no way of pay this back because we were poor to begin with. So we had to go through this wole legal system to sort it all out. We would constantly get calls everyday and night from credit card companies, wondering where their money is. Now it's been reduced to once every 2 months, or not even. We're still struggling with money, but we're survivng.  So before you think about suicide, or that you hate your parents, or that you have a bad life, think. Don't judge people. Ever since this incident, I had to get counseling. I was known to have depression, and still do. It's no joke, because depression can deprive you of so many things, like my dads life. Because he had depression, he just felt like he couldn't live anymore. It's so hard for me to tell this story because I've never told anyone before, not even my closest friend. I'm trying to choke back tears, but it's to hard. I sometimes think that I should have died instead of him, but I know that I still have friends and family to back me up. So I've told my story, maybe this time you'll understand not to judge and call people names.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 The keywords for today are "romance" and "creativity," dear Scorpio. Romance is enhanced by a heightened passion generated by a gratifying love relationship that will probably last for a long time. This very same relationship, and the emotions involved, could well give rise to artistic inspiration that can produce works of a quality that surprises even you. The only downside: though it's good that you're driven by your work, you don't want to exhaust yourself. Know when to stop.  I think my horoscopes are trying to tell me something...

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 Your talents as a master psychologist could well be put to work today when misunderstandings come up among those around you. Your companions aren't likely to be thinking straight and may not respond to reassurance, dear Scorpio, so you'll need to use your intuition to determine the best way to defuse the situation. Also, finance might be causing some worries right now, but your innate ingenuity and money sense should put things right. Tonight: go out and have a good time!  OMG...this is exactly what is happening today...In the future I want to be a pschologist, and I'm always helping someone with thier problems, and I know I will end up having to help someone again. One of my friends isn't thinking straight because one of her friends started avoiding her (they kinda made up yesterday, but she is still uneasy). And tonight I am going out to have a good time...Night of Jazz and all...and Dylan's going to be there, YAY!  Oh, btw, I went to a basket ball game yesterday...girls...we won by 20 points...go figure...

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 A partner might be feeling rather down, dear Scorpio, and need you to cheer your friend up. Too many social invitations could come your way today, and you may have to turn one of them down. You may not be in the mood for socializing, feeling the need to be alone to organize your thoughts, yet one of the events could be somehow business-related and you could feel obligated to be there. Put in an appearance. Don't feel compelled to stay very long.  OMG! This is exactly what happened to day..freaking out!

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Annoyances of daily life may be rubbing you the wrong way today, dear Scorpio. Other people's strong opinions and odd quirks may be difficult for you to swallow, and your fuse may be a bit shorter than usual. Emotions may also be running at a high intensity, and you may find yourself doing battle with the feelings in your own heart. Perhaps someone you care deeply about is creating friction in your relationship unnecessarily.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Worries about a member of your household could be plaguing you today, dear Scorpio. This person might have gone away and not told anyone, or may possibly seem upset, and shut him or herself away from everyone else. Your friend is probably basically OK, and apt to be upset with someone outside the household rather than within it. Let this person work it out in whatever way they see fit. Your friend will share with you when the time is right.

I know i told you i don't feel the way i used to I know i said things that were hard to accept from me But please believe that now tha pain's catching up with me Tell me how can i make you see That, baby, all the hurt i've caused, i'm making up for it now And i've had some time all to myself and i think i've figured it out  I never miss you 'til you're gone away from me I took your love for granted, now it's killing me And every time it happens this way, right when i let you go Imean stay, and i never miss you 'til you're gone away from me  And it's so funny 'cause i never though i'd feel like this now And if you never come back what am i to do now Will i ever mend this broken heart, i know i'm the one to blame Know i need you in my life for everything to be the same Was searching for someone i thought would be everything i need When love was right in front of me

      I still believe that if you and i Could turn the clocks back, we'd realize That what we have has gone from worse to bad It's clear, things are not what they appear Tell me what happened to butterflies I used to get them, when you;d walk by And i'd just have to touch you To know that you were mine, ain't it funny how time flies  I hate to love you, but i get the feeling When o'm thinking of you, it's crazy but true I hate to love you, but i keep believing It's the way to you, like i do  I keep on chossing to never learn Can't win for losing so i return To what i know, and even though I pray for change, same old story, same old game There's no denying that we both tried But what good is trying, if every time We breakup to makeup I'm tired of the trend, i feel it coming 'round again  How many times will i say goodbye How many tears so i have to cry How many wrongs will it take to make it right Baby, i wonder why

I still want someone to love...  I've been alone, since the day that you left me 'cause i never told, just what you mean to me I guess im afraid, of those kind of feelings Didn't mean to push you away, i realize i made a big mistake  'cause you know i know, and i know you know That every time you do, i get so lonely I know you know, and you know i know That every time you go, i get so lonely  Never fely this way, 'til you came into my life And you made me feel, something that i thought i'd never like Deep down you know, that you're everything i need So why pretend, that you dont know its hurting me, 'cause  Tell me what it takes to make you come back home Tell me what i have to say, 'cause i dont like being alone Yes, you're everything i want, you're the better part of me And, in case you didn't know, i love you more than anything  "Lonely" By Maria

      If you cut, I will bleed, bring me down to my knees You make me feel what I am is never good enough Can you help me understand, thought I made you a better man I guess somehow along the way, things just change  It seems just like a distant memory That you used to be good for me But, baby, now it's clear  I give you take, somehow it's gonna break I pray for the strength, I hate to say I know we can't go on this way I give you take, I know we're gonna break And it hurts my soul, I hate to say We can't go on this way  With your words you pull me in, I always lose I just can't win And though I see my heart is blind, it gives in every time You've got me on constant repeat, I need a cure or a remedy 'cause if I stay there won't be, nothing left for me...  Now there's nothing left for us to save 'cause only bitterness remains What we have is like a house of cards and it's falling apart And It's impossible to get it back with the bridges that you've burned I guess it's time to walk away 'cause now it's so clear...

      It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  Can anyone tell what I've done  I missed life  I missed the colours of the world  Can anyone tell where I am   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun again  Away from the sun again   I'm over this  I'm tired of living in the dark  Can anyone see me down here  The feeling's gone  There's nothing left to lift me up  Back into the world I've known   And now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines to light the way for me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again   It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  And now I can't tell what I've done   And now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines to light the way for me   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines to light the way for me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again   "Away From the Sun" By 3 Doors Down

      Spend all your time waiting for that second chance for a break that would make it okay there's always one reason to feel not good enough and it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction oh beautiful release memory seeps from my veins let me be empty and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there  so tired of the straight line and everywhere you turn there's vultures and thieves at your back and the storm keeps on twisting you keep on building the lie that you make up for all that you lack it don't make no difference escaping one last time it's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh this glorious sadness that brings me to my knees  in the arms of an angel fly away from here from this dark cold hotel room and the endlessness that you fear you are pulled from the wreckage of your silent reverie you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort there you're in the arms of the angel may you find some comfort here   "Angel" By Sarah McLachlan

      I can't get out of bed today  Or get you off my mind  I just can't seem to find a way  To leave the love behind   [Bridge:]  I ain't trippin  I'm just missing you  You know what I'm saying  You know what I mean   You kept me hanging from a string  Why you make me cry?  I tried to give you everything  But you just gave me lies   [Bridge]   [Bridge 2:]  Every now and then  When I'm all alone  I be wishing you would call me on the telephone  Say you want me back  But you never do  I feel like such a fool  There's nothing I can do..  I'm such a fool  For you   [Chorus:]  I can't take it  What am I waiting for?  My heart's still breaking  I miss you even more  And I can't fake it  The way I could before  I hate you but I love you  I can't stop thinking of you [last time x2]  It's true  I'm stuck on you   Now love's a broken record that's  Been skipping in my head  I keep singing yesterday  Why we got to play these games we play?   [Bridge]   Every now and then  When I'm all alone  I be wishing you would call me on the telephone  Say you want me back  But you never do  I feel like such a fool   [Chorus]   [Bridge 2]   [Chorus]   "Stuck" By Stacey Orrico

      I'm tired of being what you want me to be  Feeling so faithless lost under the surface  Don't know what you're expecting of me  Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes  (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)  Every step that I take is another mistake to you  (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)   [Chorus]  I've become so numb I can't feel you there  I've become so tired so much more aware  I'm becoming this all I want to do  Is be more like me and be less like you   Can't you see that you're smothering me  Holding too tightly afraid to lose control  Cause everything that you thought I would be  Has fallen apart right in front of you  (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)  Every step that I take is another mistake to you  (Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)  And every second I waste is more than I can take   [Chorus]  I've become so numb I can't feel you there  I've become so tired so much more aware  I'm becoming this all I want to do  Is be more like me and be less like you   And I know  I may end up failing too  But I know  You were just like me with someone disappointed in you   [Chorus]  I've become so numb I can't feel you there  I've become so tired so much more aware  I'm becoming this all I want to do  Is be more like me and be less like you   [Chorus]  I've become so numb I can't feel you there  I've tired of being what you want me to be  I've become so numb I can't feel you there  I've tired of being what you want me to be   "Numb" By Linkin Park

      Who can say for certain  Maybe you're still here  I feel you all around me  Your memory's so clear   Deep in the stillness  I can hear you speak  You're still an inspiration  Can it be (?)  That you are my  Forever love  And you are watching over me from up above   Fly me up to where you are  Beyond the distant star  I wish upon tonight  To see you smile  If only for awhile to know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are   Are you gently sleeping  Here inside my dream  And isn't faith believing  All power can't be seen   As my heart holds you  Just one beat away  I cherish all you gave me everyday  'Cause you are my  Forever love  Watching me from up above   And I believe  That angels breathe  And that love will live on and never leave   Fly me up  To where you are  Beyond the distant star  I wish upon tonight  To see you smile  If only for awhile  To know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are   I know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are   "To Where You Are" By Josh Groban

      And I'd give up forever to touch you  Cause I know that you feel me somehow  You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be  And I don't want to go home right now   And all I can taste is this moment  And all I can breathe is your life  Cause sooner or later it's over  I just don't want to miss you tonight   And I don't want the world to see me  Cause I don't think that they'd understand  When everything's made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am   And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming  Or the moment of truth in your lies  When everything feels like the movies  Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive   And I don't want the world to see me  Cause I don't think that they'd understand  When everything's made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am   I don't want the world to see me  Cause I don't think that they'd understand  When everything's made to be broken  I just want you to know who I am   I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am   "Iris" By The Goo Goo Dolls

      What am I supposed to do  With all these blues  Haunting me, everywhere, no matter what I do  Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow  I cant let go  When will this night be over   I didn't mean to fall in love with you  And baby there's a name for what you put me through  It isn't love, it's robbery  I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me   Seen a lot of broken hearts go sailing by  Phantom ships, lost at sea  And one of them is mine  Raising my glass, I sing a toast to the midnight sky  I wonder why  The stars don't seem to guide me   I didn't mean to fall in love with you  And baby there's a name for what you put me through  It isn't love, it's robbery  I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me   The ghost of you and me  When will it set me free  I hear the voices call  Following footsteps down the hall  Trying to save what's left of my heart and soul   Watching the candle flicker out in the evening glow  I can't let go  When will the night be over   I didn't mean to fall in love with you  And baby there's a name for what you put me through  It isn't love, it's robbery  I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me   I didn't mean to fall in love with you  And baby there's a name for what you put me through  It isn't love, it's robbery  I'm sleeping with the ghost of you and me   "The Ghost of You and Me" By BBMak

      If the sky opened up for me,  And the mountain disappeared,  If the seas ran dry, turned to dust  And the sun refused to rise  I would still find my way,  By the light I see in your eyes  The world I know fades away  But you stay   As the earth reclaims it due  And the cycle starts anew  We'll stay, always  In the love that we have  Shared before time   If the years take away  Every memory that I have  I would still know the way  That would lead me back to your side  The north star may die  But the light that I see in your eyes  Will burn there always   Lit by the love we have  Shared before time   When the forest turns to jade  And the stories that we've made  Dissolve away  One shining light will still remain   When we shed our earthly skin  And when our real life begins  There'll be no shame  Just the love that we have made before time   "A Love Before Time" By Coco Lee

      Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me  Oh things are gonna happen naturally  Oh taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side  And balancing the whole thing  But often times those words get tangled up in lines  And the bright lights turn to night  Until the dawn it brings  A little bird who sing about the magic that was you and me   Cause you and I both loved  What you and I spoke of  Others just read of  Others only dream of the love that I love   See I'm all about them words  Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words  Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards  More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive  Now you and I, you and I  Not so little you and I anymore  And with this silence brings a moral story  more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy   you and I both loved what you and I spoke of  and others just read of and if you could see now  well I'm almost finally out of  well I'm almost finally finally, well I am free oh I'm free   and it's okay if you have go away  Oh just remember the telephone works both ways  and if I never ever hear it ring  if nothing else I'll think the bells inside  have finally found you someone else and that's okay  cause I'll remember everything you sang   you and I both loved what you and I spoke of  and others just read of and if you could see now  well I'm almost finally out of  I'm finally out of, finally, deedeeededede  well I'm almost finally, finally out of words.

      I wish I can take everything back. I know it will be hard to talk again, but it's a start with AIM. Let's face it though, friends do fall apart, but I miss you, I miss everybody. I wish I didn't let little things get in the way. I cry about not being a good friend. But I was so sure that I was. I've always had friends. I guess ever since my dad died, I've changed...alot. I don't want to be this way. I've had so many dreams about one of you dying. And we never became friends again. I regreted not talking to you, or saying sorry for something. I'm trying to forgive myself. I've given up on religion. I don't know what to believe in. I hope that when I'm older I see a different path in life.

      For all those hopeless romantics out there...  Love can be a many splendid thing Can't deny the joy it brings A dozen roses, diamond rings Dreams for sale and fairy tales It'll make you hear a symphony And you just want the world to see But like a drug that makes you blind, It'll fool ya every time  The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn't care how fast you fall And you can't refuse the call See, you got no say at all  Now I was once a fool, it's true I played the game by all the rules But now my world's a deeper blue I'm sadder, but I'm wiser too I swore I'd never love again I swore my heart would never mend Said love wasn't worth the pain But then I hear it call my name  (The trouble with) The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn't care how fast you fall And you can't refuse the call See, you got no say at all  Every time I turn around I think I've got it all figured out My heart keeps callin' and I keep on fallin' Over and over again The sad story always ends the same Me standin' in the pourin' rain It seems no matter what I do It tears my heart in two  (The trouble with love is) The trouble with love, yeah (It can tear you up inside) It can tear you up inside (Make your heart believe a lie) Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride  (The trouble with love is)  It's in your heart It's in your soul (doesn't care how fast you fall) You won't get no control (and you can't refuse the call) See, you got no say at all  (The trouble with love is) Oh, yeah (It can tear you up inside) (Make your heart believe a lie)  "The Trouble With Love Is" By Kelly Clarkson

      Young girl, don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall Young girl, it's all right Your tears will dry, you'll soon be free to fly     When you're safe inside your room you tend to dream  Of a place where nothing's harder than it seems No one ever wants or bothers to explain Of the heartache life can bring and what it means     When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within     Young girl, don't hide You'll never change if you just run away Young girl, just hold tight And soon you're gonna see your brighter day     Now in a world where innocence is quickly claimed It's so hard to stand your ground when you're so afraid No one reaches out a hand for you to hold When you're lost outside look inside to your soul    When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within   Yeah... Life is a journey  It can take you anywhere you choose to go As long as you're learning You'll find all you'll ever need to know     You'll make it You'll make it Just don't go forsaking yourself No one can stop you You know that I'm talking to you     When there's no one else Look inside yourself Like your oldest friend Just trust the voice within Then you'll find the strength That will guide your way If you will learn to begin  To trust the voice within    Young girl don't cry I'll be right here when your world starts to fall    "The Voice Within" by Christina Aguilera

      Where you are seems to be As far as an eternity Outstretched arms open hearts And if it never ends then when do we start? I'll never leave you behind Or treat you unkind I know you understand And with a tear in my eye Give me the sweetest goodbye That I ever did receive  Pushing forward and arching back Bring me closer to heart attack Say goodbye and just fly away When you comeback I have some things to say  How does it feel to know you never have to be alone When you get home There must be someplace here that only you and I could go So I can show you how I Dream away everyday Try so hard to disregard The rhythm of the rain that drops And coincides with the beating of my heart  I'll never leave you behind Or treat you unkind I know you understand And with a tear in my eye Give me the sweetest goodbye That I ever did receive  Pushing forward and arching back Bring me closer to heart attack Say goodbye and just fly away When you comeback I have some things to say  How does it feel to know you never have to be alone When you get home There must be someplace here that only you and I could go So I can show you how I feel  "Sweetest Goodbye" by Maroon5

      A couple of nights ago, I had a dream about my friend (oh wait, excuse me, now ex-friend) and I won't say which one. She came up to me to ask for forgiveness, which I thought odd. I don't know what I did, but if it were to happen right now, I don't think I would forgive easily. What a sec., what am I forgiving anyways? There was nothing done wrong except MY stupid mistake to be the bitch that I am. I hate myself more and more everyday, and I'm about to take a knife and plunge it through my heart. I wish I could rewind my life to the first big mistake that happened, which was being born. I can't wait to go to college and never see some of these people ever again. Unless I become friends with everyone I thought I cared about again, cause I do like people, and being with them. There's nothing wrong with you, just me...

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Nothing is too hot for you to handle, but why do you insist on holding on to the burning iron rod if you don't have to, dear Scorpio? Perhaps you are trying to prove to someone that you can take the heat without being affected by it. The truth is, however, that you can get burned just as easily as everyone else, even though you might try to deny it. Do things for yourself, not to prove something to other people - especially when it comes to matters of love and romance.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Today is a terrific day for you, dear Scorpio, in which you finally seem to have a grasp on your thought process and inner emotions. You will find yourself feeling extra sensitive and loving, and people will be drawn to you because of it. You will notice that you are able to look at your feelings in a rational, levelheaded manner instead being at the mercy of your wildly fluctuating emotions.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Your artistic talents could be put to good use today fixing up wherever it is that you work on, dear Scorpio. You might want to repaint, or put up new plants or pictures, or anything else that makes the place seem a little more dressed up. This is not only going to be fun. Both the process of doing it and the end results should lift your mood, and keep you stimulated for the next few days. Have fun!

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 You may be feeling a little unsure of what you believe in at the moment, dear Scorpio. Your mind is filled with questions and contradictions. Try to realize that the journey to finding your true purpose could take a lifetime. No one else expects you to have all the answers right now, so why should you? Relax a little and try and enjoy more of your moments spent with your loved ones. You may find out that this is really all you need.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Frustrating delays in completing a project you've been working on might cause you to doubt your own skills, dear Scorpio. Be careful not to fall into this trap. There is nothing wrong with your skills. Take a good long look at what you're doing and try to discern where it got hung up. Worries about money may cause you to consider postponing an activity that means a lot to you. Don't. Use your innate ingenuity to work it all out.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Generally you are pretty stable emotionally, dear Scorpio, but today events around you might seem to be conspiring to create erratic moods that you aren't used to experiencing. No major concerns should arise, but little irritations such as dropping things, misplacing your keys, or missing a phone call could really get on your nerves. Slow down, breathe deeply, and stay focused. It's the only way you'll remain calm today.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Don't take "no" for an answer today, dear Scorpio. Chances are, you won't have to. People will be much more understanding of your situation, and they will have compassion for your cause. Your deep inner strength will show through loud and clear, and you have the inner desire to make anything happen that you want. There is a lucky star smiling over you that is helping you tackle any project that you undertake.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 You may find yourself butting head to head with someone who is equally as unwilling to budge from their position as you, dear Scorpio. Use this conflict as a lesson on perspective, and understand the motivation of the opposite side. The life lesson you may need to learn the most probably has to do with discipline and the need for honest sweat from your brow. Don't be afraid to work a little harder than you have been in order to make your dreams come true.

      Here is my Chinese reading for the day...  Thursday is a stellar, and Tuesday and Friday are auspicious. You will work hard, but the end results will be good. The days also offer a fresh start, an opportunity for remedying a previously unfavorable situation. Dating Tigers should let weekend romances take their natural course. The love vibrations are sensitive, causing many changes. When you move too quickly, you get in emotional water over your head. You could drown before you can save yourself.

      I had a dream last night and I think I was crying. Right now my body feels so heavy. I can't remember the dream, but I have a feeling that it was something I wanted to take back; a mistake that I made, and wish that I could die for it. I wish I could have made a different choice in my dream and different choices in reality.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 Remember that the more tightly you try to hang on to something, dear Scorpio, the more likely it will naturally want to slip through your fingers. Grab hold of what you want, but don't squeeze too hard. An important balance must be maintained between showing someone you care by taking them under your wing, yet allowing them their freedom to be their own person. Sensitive feelings are operating today so proceed with care.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 There could be a great deal of friction in your world today, dear Scorpio, as stubborn minds come into conflict with each other in an aggressive manner. Be careful of how you treat others, for feelings are likely to be hurt if you are not sensitive in terms of where you point your stinger. Others may look tough, but deep down they are just as soft as you are. Think twice about using your aggressive nature at the expense of others.  Now I feel bad, but I'm always having a bad day. I feel that no one cares even if they say they do. I wish you could be more clearer about what you say. And if it's a joke, it's a sick joke...

We both know that we want it  But we both know you left me no choice     [Chorus]     We both know that I'm not over you  I'm not over you  "Til I Get Over You" By Michelle Branch

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 If you've been feeling sluggish lately, chances are that this will be a welcome day for you, dear Scorpio. Today will see a surge in energy that will greatly increase your creativity and physical strength. Seize the opportunity to get out into the fresh air for a sports activity, or even just a long walk. Engaging in exercise can direct your physical energy, plus give your mind a chance to clear. Don't be surprised if you discover clarity and focus afterward. Make the most of this.  I got fresh air today...I walked home. That was pretty long and my feet HURT. OWWY!!

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 20 Make your dreams a valuable tool for insight, dear Scorpio. In days past, great rulers and kings believed so strongly in the insight their dreams carried that they employed interpreters. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights, or the result of random firings of your brain's release of thought and emotion, there is much to be gained. Recurring dreams hold much significance, as they can point to something that needs to be taken care of. Consider exploring this area.

After our discussion about the baby, I heard from a source that another cheerleader got knocked up (I won't say which one.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Today you should be asking yourself a lot of really important questions, dear Scorpio. The universe is pushing you along on your journey of self-discovery. If you're resisting, you're not going to be in a very good mood. You might want to try facilitating this period with some yoga or meditation. Or you may decide to start keeping a dream journal. Try to really listen to yourself on an intuitive level. You'll probably find out that you have the answers already...

You could also consider completing a long-term project that was put on hold over the past week or so. Tying up loose ends may take up much of your time today, dear Scorpio, and could keep you busy. Don't forget to take a little time for yourself, however. You are your first priority!

This feeling of conflict may have your stomach tied up in knots, making it difficult to deal with anything or anyone in a rational manner. Try not to take everything too personally when people express disapproval of your actions. Remember that their reaction is to your behavior and not necessarily to you in general.

A deeper understanding of the motives of others may well up within you, making it easier for you to deal with those around you. Your intuitive abilities are operating at a high level, and so you're likely to form new bonds based on what you sense about others. Tonight: Celebrate! You need the uplift!

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 You may be asking yourself, dear Scorpio, why it is that you can so easily get control of many parts of your life, but that when it comes to love and romance, nothing seems to be going right. Dismiss the notion that you are unworthy of someone else's love. It is also important that you don't try to portray yourself as someone that you are not. Perhaps you are confusing the people around you by projecting an image that is completely different from the person you really are.

However, some exciting phone calls at midday might perk you up a bit - perhaps good news from a friend or colleague. A change in your financial condition is definitely indicated, as is the resulting boost in your self-esteem. All looks wonderful for you in the months to come. Enjoy it!

      I had a dream last night that one of my best friends confronted me and said that "I hate you". She and I have been friends since 4th grade...But lately I have been drifting from her because we have nothing in common anymore. She kinda forced me into things I didn't want to do, like baseball stats and band. I only joined with her because she can't handle being alone. And since all of her friends are leaving for college, she's depending on me for everything. I sound so ranty right about now, but I need to get this outta my head. One of my other friends (who is leaving for college) and I were talking at one point about pet peeves we have about her, and we both agree that she needs to get her own life once in a while. It's fine that she hangs out with me, but there are times were I wish I went with the popular crowd back in fourth grade. I hate the fact that I'm ding this to her, but she has no other friends cause she chose to go with older people. Some of her friends are lower classmen, but honestly, what lower classmen would want to hang with her. She can't drive yet (well neither can I, but I only have 2 driving hours left, and she has done none) and all she cares about are hot guys (who she can never get), singing (which has gone to her head to make her believe she is the best singer there is), and theatre (which also made her believe she is the best actress). Her career choice is to become an actress or singer. She has no back up plan; that is her set goal. Even actress' and singers struggle to get where they are. And to tell you the truth, she is not skinny. And you know how people are: they have to be thin as a rail. Sure there are a few overweight people in the business, but that's a few. She doesn't want to do anything else because she made herself believe she can't do anything else. And it sickens me that she has no willpower to do anything else in life. So if she's pissed at me, then I'm pissed back. And I hope she reads this because she needs to know the truth. No one has ever told her the truth about life, because I think her family tries to protect her from that. And her family is also to blame, because they are the one's that made her believe she ca become and actress or singer and nothing else. The only good thing about her family is that they don't want to send her to the college of her choice (It's a liberal arts college, one I plan to go to). And she is trying to convince them to send her. I hope they say no...I feel like a total bitch now, but I feel a lot better...

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 At the same time that you feel as if you are on the brink of winning the Nobel Prize, you may also feel like you are on the edge of insanity, dear Scorpio. Today you may delight in knowing that the people around you are going through tremendous emotional turmoil and difficulty, as well. You will get the feeling that you are not alone in your quest for emotional stability. Share your feelings with others instead of shutting them up inside.

The planetary configuration is confirming that it is time for you to express yourself - your emotions, your desires, your points of view, to take a firmer stand and define more clearly who you are - for others and also for yourself. Second guessing the potential reactions of others will ultimately get you nowhere.

Take some time off to devote time to yourself and your family. You all deserve some quality time together.

You know, I just realised that when we were talking about Valleyfair. I don't know why it just popped into my head then. Maybe cause I feel like shit all of a sudden, cause I turned out to be a total bitch this week. Maybe cause my body realises what day is coming up, and I try to forget about it. I don't know, but now it brings me down a little more. I hope I can still have fun at Valleyfair, without bringing everyone down.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Today you may have difficulties connecting with others, dear Scorpio. People may be unnecessarily harsh for seemingly no reason. Try not to get too emotionally worked up over these slights. Keep a safe distance between yourself and the drama around you. The next step you take might send you down a pit of quicksand, so make sure there is a good friend standing by to help pull you out.

Your rational mind tells you that everything is in place, that things are fine and that you have a green light to go ahead with all of your plans. There is a small voice inside you, however, that is suggesting otherwise. Perhaps you have an inkling that your plan is flawed in some way. Perhaps you are trying to ignore a certain pain in your heart by keeping it a secret from others, when in reality, you need to let it out to the world.

      I was in a car accident yesterday...scared the hell out of me...And now I hurt, so my mom is telling me to go to the emergency room...never been there before. Damn you to hell Wisconson!!! (No offense to anyone) But jees...Here's the story...this girl from Wisconson, who is new here, went the freakin wrong way on a one way. She thought the light was green for her...THERE IS NO GOD DAMN LIGHT WHEN ON THE WRONG SIDE!!! Anyways, my brother was teaching me how to drive, and I was going down a street with the lights all green, and BAM outta no where she comes right on the side I was driving. We swerved right, went over a curb, barely missing a tree. I yelled "OH MY GOD!" really loud cause I was not processing what just happened. If my brother wasn't there to help me turn away from the tree, I'd probably be dead right now, and not typing this. Wort experience ever...My brother was about to beat the crap out of her, then he saw she had a baby in the back. But this experience is not gonna stop me from driving...Just beware the one way street...

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 This is an excellent day to tell people exactly what you feel, dear Scorpio. Your emotions are more stable than usual, so open up and speak from your heart. Also, listen. What you learn will be extremely valuable for the future, so pay attention. Keep an eye on what is real, but feel free to let your heart explore all the possibilities. Follow your emotions and trust your instincts. You stand to gain a great deal.

      Last night I had my fortune told by a Cambodian fortune teller...It was cool by the way...She used playing cards to do it...here's what my brother translated for me (cause she was speaking in Cambodian, duh)....  I have to work hard in school in order to get these things. I'm gonna meet an older guy in college and go out with him. He's a millionare and is very well known. Then I end up marrying him. I'm gonna end up going far away and then come back. We have two children, a boy and a girl, who will grow up to be very good. I'm gonna take care of my entire family. I'm gonna have a lot of friends cause everyone likes me and cause I'm nice. I'm going to live a long and happy life.  That's what my brother told me. I ended up getting a king card twice, and the 7 card twice...That always means something....

      Saw the Spiderman 2 yesterday. It was really  good. I recommend seeing it. But the bad thing was I had to pee during the whole 2 hours and umpteen minutes. There was a lot of things you shouldn't miss. I almost went to the bathroom, but was afraid that I'd miss something important. Anyways, I give Spiderman 2 two thumbs up.

      OMG!!! Valleyfair kicked ASS!!!! Especially going with Steph, Gena, and Cheryl...It was so much fun. I love the Steel Venom and the Wild Thing. We also got wet, but it was windy so it was a little chilly. We got our pics taken in the begining. I got it in the form of a keychain, so in order for me to scan it, I'd have to scan the whole thing. I don't think I screamed so hard in my life...Well anyways, I don't think there really is a word to describe how much fun I had.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 Things should go well for you today, dear Scorpio, as long as you are able to keep the drama to a minimum. You are able to jump over any hurdle that comes your way. So don't worry about a thing! You have a sharp and intuitive wit about you that is grounded in the real world. Take care of the details and plan your next big move. Clean, organize, and throw away things that no longer serve you.

      Ok...so I told Anne I would tell her about this Asian thing I was doing. Well it was a Cambodian fundraiser for thier temple. And I was in it. Modeling clothes. There were four pairs of us modeling wedding clothes, cause in a Cambodian wedding you have to change alot. But we only showed off four of them. I got to wear the final outfit. Oh, and my partner was my broher. This was my day...(all times are approximate)  3:00 AM- Woke up and took a shower. After the shower I got dressed (duh) 3:30 AM- We went to this persons house (they provided the clothes and accessories). When I got there three of the girls were there. One was having her hair done, the other looked dead. My      hair was wet, so someone had to blowdry it. 4:00 AM- It was my turn to do my hair  5:00 AM- My hair is done, so we went home (my brother and I) 5:30 AM- Go to the sectional and pull out the recliner. I had to sleep sitting up cause of my up-do. I couldn't fall asleep either. I just kind of sat there with my eyes shut, listening to all the birds outside spaz about morning. 10:00 AM- Wake up, went to my room got some shoes and make-up 10:10 AM- Arrived at the temple. We went in and sat there for two hours while they were praying 12:00 PM- Met up with the others   Somewhere between that time and 3:00 PM I ate, put on make-up, watched everyone get dressed, then me finally getting dressed. I also took pics with the fam. Then at 4:00 PM, we all just kinda of hung outside and ate somemore, and listen to people talk, dance, and play instruments. Then at 5:00 PM ish it was finally our turn to go up and model the clothes. Then after that we took a shitload of pictures (Someday I will have them on devArt!) Then at who knows what time we finally changed. Then we walked around. Then I sat and ate somemore. Then I left to go change again for a party (I wore my corset and a skirt) Then at 9:00 PM I finally leave for the party. We got there, and I danced a little. Then we went home at 11:00 PM. Then I put my pjs on, tried to take every frickin bobby pin out of my hair (I swear there were more then a 100 in my hair), brushed it, tied it up, then went to brush my teeth, and went to bed.

      Scorpio  October 23 - November 21 You may be anxious to say what is on your mind today, dear Scorpio. Words are on the tip of your tongue, and you aren't afraid to let them spill out. Be careful. There is a great tendency to put your foot in your mouth. Your words may come across as being a bit harsher than you intend. Be sensitive of other people's emotions. Don't unload your problems on others.  So I did this a couple of days ago...I loath myself....

      Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of which has caught my eye    And roped me in  So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing   I am captivated    (Chorus)  I am Vindicated  I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along    And I am flawed   But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself    So clear  Like the diamond in your ring  Cut to mirror your intentions  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me so isoloated, so motivated  I am certain now that    (Chorus)    So turn  Up the corners of your lips  Part them and feel my finger tips  Trace the moment, fall forever  Defense is paper thin  Just one touch and I'd be in  Too deep now to ever swim against the current  So let me slip away [3x]  So let me slip against the current and let me slip away    (Chorus)    Slight hope  It dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption...    "Vindicated" By Dashboard Confessional
