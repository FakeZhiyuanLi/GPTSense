      woke up at 9 and staggered to work.. i tell you this waking up at the crack of dawn does not suit me at all!! worked until lunch cleaning up the wreckage from yesterday.. not so much power tools today.. by the way, you know what's even better than getting paid to work with power tools?? getting paid to watch hot girls in skimpy clothes working with power tools!! yeah baby!! to just illustrate my point,  urlLink please click here .. then click on 'most popular', and the second entry should say "Women with Power Tools".. enjoy!!  read a few very interesting blogs:  urlLink suzannah ,  urlLink therapy ,  urlLink wasted nirvana  all made good reading. if hilarious reading is more your kinda thing, then rahul phondke has surpassed himself in this week's  urlLink Funnybone    my cooking turn today, so just made up something simple, then chilled out watching a movie.. we did this really cool 4-way conference on the phone.. shiv, bunty, abi n me.. pinku wasn't picking his fone.. and we were chatting with koshman on msn.. that was loads of fun.. then vip called, saying he was lighting one up.. so had to go - when you hear the calling, you simply have to go.. so we smoked up.. and were doing this hilarious conference with a certain someone who should remain unnamed.. unless she(oops!!) would like her name mentioned here!! we did prove the 'passive-high' principle.. whereby the other person gets hammered by just listening!! seriously, we knew that the power of auto-suggestion was strong enough to get the people around you high, but we managed to prove that physical presence was not necessary.. and it carries over air waves too!!

      those of you who know me know that monday and i are not friends.. there has not been a monday in living memory that i can say that i have enjoyed immensely.. today was no less.. instead of resting my bones after a hard weekend's partying, i had to get up early and go work at the archi. dept. cleanup.. that was fun though.. i'm getting paid good money to play with power tools.. woo hoo :-)) demolished a wind tunnel in a few hours.. its all a huge pile of firewood and screws now.. though i am wondering if i can get the twin fans from it and put it somewhere in the house.. the heat and humidity will NOT be a problem this summer then!!  ahh. monday suddenly got so so much better.. gaurav just got back from india.. brought a bottle of seagram's 'blender's pride'.. nice.. and of course, there was the wills classic as well.. drank well, ate dal-rajmaha-chawwal and had a nice time reminiscing the summer's 'harkatey'!! good times man, good times..

      the day after is always sooo mellow.. you enjoy every minute of the day.. watched a very explosive czech side dismantle the resolute danes 3-0.. am definitely tipping them to go all the way.. with playmakers like nedved and poborsky, even average strikers like baros(he spent half the season sitting on liverpool's bench) cannot help but score! holland vs. czech is looking like a very likely final now, unless mr. figo can pull a few rabbits out of his hat, hopefully without the ref's help this time round..   a quick thank you to the 60+ people who read this blog everyday.. i really appreciate it, and would like to ask more of you to drop a line in the comments section.. it would be very nice to hear from more of you - comments, complaints, compliments, or even a simple hi!  had the GISA-organised cricket tournament final today.. in which the 'balle balle' boyz narrowly lost out to 'sam's south select'.. the boyz were ultimately undone by controversial umpiring no less.. good work by all: kavin, raghu, vamsi, adi(abcd), reddy-ul-haq, vip, molson express, asif, dawg, shashi.. got together at molson's place after that.. smoked up.. and had to endure pritam gilchrist's amazingly awful guitar-playing too.. master pai is back in town too, en route to penn state from long island..

      my head hurts!! beer is not supposed to give you a hangover!! then again you're not supposed to chug endless beers either.. ;-)) apparently we went through 5 18-packs of bud.. saurabh and his friend dhiraj came in from pittsburgh yesterday afternoon.. showed them the downtown and the two UB campuses.. then at night we barbecued at vip's along with his cricket team.. what a wild lot.. raghu dude, reddy and kavin.. adi is also big time into new rock.. molson express and vamshi were quiet.. and then mallick and puri also dropped in.. puri's back from india.. with enough packs of Wills Classic.. ahh, Wills Classic.. *nostalgic moment*. we grilled some chicken thighs, they came out pretty awesome!! was really really hammered.. came home and crashed on the couch straight!!  woke up solid sozzled still, hey, that's alliteration! i have realised that i do my best and most inspired work on the day after.. the day after is always gooood, you always wake up with a smile on your face ;-) went with mayank and the juniors to Moti Mahal for the lunch buffet.. $5-all-you-can-eat.. couldn't stuff myself silly as usual.. which is definitely the best indication that i'm getting too old for this rock n' roll lifestyle.. sigh.  took them to the niagara falls after that.. had a nice long chilled out nap there under a tree.. spoke to quite a few people at length today.. smi, abi, neil, my aunt in NJ.. then i joined the baccho on the Cave of The Winds thingy.. hurricane deck rules!! got back home at night around 12ish, then vip called - we had the living leaves, the fantastic foliage, the vonderful vegetation, the verdant vitality.. felt goood to smoke up after so long!! went to Third Base with ash.. was very quiet and chilled out today, luke was bartender, nate was sitting around, and dodi and hubby were pretty tight, you should have seen ash squirm!! we made it worthwhile though with the captain morgan flavoured rums.. i just lurrv the pineapple..    greece did the business on the french!! amazing!! they beat them 1-0, and actually pretty much outclassed them too. then holland took out the swedes on penalties.. they finally seem to be getting over their big-tournament-penalty-hoodoo.. wow, some euro this is turning out to be.. the superpowers are all out.. now portugal play holland, and greece play the winner of cz. rep. vs. denmark, most likely cz.. cool!!

      despite all my good intentions of waking up early and going to the lab, i could not - the spirit was willing but the flesh was weak, sigh!! ;-)) just played around a bit with the blog, and made some modifications and stuff. you will have noticed the My Photos and My Poetry sections on the right hand column (not all is original - you can tell my stuff way before you reach the credits at the end!!). by the way, shavi and abi, saurabh gupta of your wing is coming here for a couple of days tomorrow.. he's currently in pittsburgh at carnegie-mellon for his summer training.  effectively did nothing constructive today then; no going downtown for Thursday At The Square since i had to go to the archi. dept to help out with the cleaning, then was fiercely hungry, so came home and cooked.. mal, nats, sank, vip and ash all came over.. and we had to watch 'Main Madhuri Dixit Banni Chahti Hoon' yet again.. raja of course stole the show:  "sab toh nahin dekh pahte hain.."  and  "bhaiya chai faltoo hain kya?"   england got knocked out on penalties yet again in a major tournament, by hosts portugal this time. they did have reason to feel aggrieved though, since they had what looked like a perfectly good goal disallowed due to goalie ricardo's antics.. the 'silver goal' rule didn't ease tensions either.. and the penalty shootout was a thriller too.. beckham has not exorcised his penalty demons yet has he?! ricardo also committed himself too early as three consecutive penalties went in dead centre.. did anyone notice he was keeping in the shootout without his gloves!! poor vassell looked overawed as he shot tamely at ricardo, who picked himself up too shoot very well into the bottom left corner and send the host nation into raptures. just a quick note about wayne rooney - no doubt he would have been a major influence to the game had he not limped off after 20 minutes.. and from a very selfish evertonian point of view, hopefully now the big team scouts will stop hounding him!!

      yesterday i woke up and thought, since i've made it to the middle of the week, might as well take a day off!! so i did ;-)) it didn't help that i was on the phone until around 3 before that - had spoken to mal, smi, john, karrishma, and my cousin tulz.. and then really made an effort to finish that Harry Potter V.. and i must say that JK Rowlings has written an eye-opener for all the pre-teen kids who will read this!! harry and hermione keep going at it every couple of pages!! yeesh!! they're like a couple of bunnies!! vip, mal, ash, guess who i'm thinking about right now ;-))!!  watched a very ruthless czech republic 'B' team do the business on the germans 2-1.. and then holland dispatched a visibly exhausted latvia 3-0, so the germans join italy and spain on a early summer holiday.. the quarter finals start today.. england & hosts portugal face off today.  went and did a bit of the clean up with nats n' mal, then went over to their place, sank, vip n ash also came over.. and we had some awesome pasta (mal made!!) and choccie-chip cookies (nats made!!), with a bottle of port (thanks viki) and a 3 litre box of white zin (thank you thank you!) - came home buzzed, and slept off early for a change!!   just a quick line to say a very big  THANK YOU  to all of you who keep coming back to read the blog.. it's getting around 40 hits a day thanks to all of you.. and i have put up some pics in the My Photos section on the right.. enjoy!!

      it's my roommate inder's birthday today!! yay!! went out for dinner to "Taste of India", and stuffed ourselves silly.. now i'm too full to sit!! nats made chocolate-chip cookies, and i passed those up, so you can imagine how full i was!! saw some really cool sites today.. one of them i'm trying to make myself -  urlLink Saurabh's World , no harm in a bit of self-promotion eh?! ;-)) .. the other cool one was  urlLink Worst Case Scenarios , which contains info on how to get out of all sorts of weird and wild scrapes - i found it especially useful, knowing the kinds of things i keep doing!!  nilesh finally did what i have been sooo lazy about.. he posted most of the florida pics at his yahoo pics site -  urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/decemberdude .. enjoy!!  sweden and denmark somehow contrived to get the exact 2-2 score that they would need to both go through, and lock italy out.. much as one hates to say that it is not possible to rig an interational soccer match.. but the bitter man in me does feel really aggrieved.. italy created chance upon chance and finally scraped out a 2-1 win over a very resolute bulgarian side.. though what the f**k had the ref been drinking/smoking before the freaking game!!!

      my friends, it is with a very heavy heart i sit here to write this.. only the cruellest juxtaposition of the stars would serve to eliminate italy, yet the trajectories did cross, and the azzurri are out of euro 2004.. with it bringing to a certain end the international careers of three great italian forwards.. christian vieri, pippo inzaghi and, and.. and alessandro del piero.. who at 29 has had his legs fail him yet again on the international stage.. 24 goals and 66 caps say nothing about his amazing talent, leadership and gift of reading the game.   i have followed alex since '93.. when he first stepped into roberto baggio's shoes.. and immediately became juventus' wonderkid.. and testament to his faith and belief in the  bianconeri ,  'il pinturicchio'  has never played for any other club at the highest level. i have been with him through all his highs and lows.. five serie A titles, four champions league finals (3 consecutive), 1 inter-continental club cup, 3 copa italia finals.. and the big championships.. euro '96 when he was in the squad that got eliminated by czech rep. drawing 3-3 with russia, world cup '98 when cesare maldini's indecision over del piero and baggio led to france shutting them out on penalties, euro 2000 when del piero was heavily blamed for not scoring in the final and france pulling back to beat them on golden goal, world cup 2002 when trap could not decide whether to play with totti and/or del piero, and now euro 2004 where trap is playing him on the left tip of his arrowhead formation.. it has been a very frustrating international career for alex.. plus the numerous niggling injuries he has picked up in the serie A, truly the toughest defensive league in the world. one hopes he still has it in him to play world cup 2006, but he remains one of the greatest players to have never won an international crown..  grazie  alessandro,  buona fortuna  for the future, and  arrivederci  for now. maybe it's time for me to hang up my italia no. 7 jersey..

      i really need to get back on a more normal sleep cycle.. somehow i don't get sleepy until 5 am.. and then the whole of the next day passes in a groggy haze.. not that its bad, but when there's work to be done it does get irritating. went to the lab and made backups of the floppy.. will go in tomorrow to acually starts doing a few scans.. met up with mal and nats to see to the archi. dept. cleanups - i need some money for food (and drink!!) before i start the internship!! here's a  urlLink pic of me  too at a bar-b-q!    one of my favourite juniors kriti has a  urlLink blog  - he's got a nice blog, and i remember how it felt being that age too.. from a link on his site, i read a very interesting blog too -  urlLink astha narang  is "Indian-Belgian-Iranian-Czech-Pakistani(my sindhi roots).. oh, and part Canadian".. she writes pretty well.  pinku had gone down to indianapolis for the Formula 1 race there this weekend.. he did get close to all the drivers and called us all up to hear what F1 cars sound like.. predictably, schumi won.. again!! will put up teh pictures as soon as he sends them to me.. bunty made a surprise road trip to new orleans to see ranj.. more details in his  urlLink blog , he also got a very sweet picture of ranj, which under threats of severe pain and injury we have both been intimidated into not displaying here or on his blog.. what happened to FREE PRESS???  wayne rooney just cemented his place in the history books didn't he!! he's looking so fresh that everyone's glad everton manager david moyes rested him lots.. talking of which.. it's gonna be very very hard for everton to hold on to the starlet. he scored two very amazing goals yesterday as england saw off croatia 4-2, and with france beating the swiss 3-1, it meant france top group B and play the greeks in the quarters, and sets up a delicious england vs. portugal in another quarter.  meanwhile, my favourite azzuris.. they need to win by 2 or more goals against bulgaria.. alex del piero.. my hero, we have never needed goals and inspiration from you more than now!! oh yeah, they also have to hope sweden and denmark do not draw 2-2.. or by some weird and wild arithmetic they still get knocked out even if they win 46-0!!!

      i love these chilled out lazy weekends.. where i don't have to do anything but lie in, read a few good books, eat some good food, have a few good drinks, watch a few good movies, listen to some good music.. yup, one does enjoy the good things in life!! got to chat with quite a few people over the weekend - a very cosmopolitan mix!! anne (from kenya, now studying medicine in north carolina), my cousin rana (high school in kenya), farhina (from kenya, air hostess with emirates in dubai - sigh! farhina, farhina, where art thou my precious..), sophie/sofi (from kenya, working in the UK), pranay/pondy (studying at IIM-Cal), shruti (from india, studying at yale).. so apparently i have a 'sister' who looks like me back in kenya.. she's also a 'mittra'.. and is studying in AKA.. where (apparently!!) i'm stiil a legend!! HAHAHAHAH - me like!!   spoke to mom n' dad after quite a long time.. they were glad to hear about the internship.. actually relieved would be more like it.. dad is really really pissed with the italians.. shabana's birthday too, so called her up as well.. she's doing well.. her work pressure seems to have eased off.. i chilled out the whole day with Harry Potter V - Order of the Phoenix, though it's a lot like reading a Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew or something.. the kid has the hots for anything female on two legs!  watched some of the best soccer around yesterday as the czech republic showed how damn good they really are!! pavel nedved showed why he was european player of the year.. poborsky still has his awesome guile.. rosicky and baros are solid players, as is smicer.. jan koller is the tallest man in soccer.. and peter cech is worth every bit of the big bucks chelsea paid for him.. holland didn't stand a chance as czech pulled back from 2-0 down to win 3-2.. and the dutch remain with the tag of "nearly-men"!! latvia fought bravely to hold germany goalless.. and the germans really really need to sweep out all the hapless oldies - schneider, klose, bobic.. who snatch misses out of clear goals!!  portugal rode their luck and knocked a very feeble and inefficient-looking spanish side out.. the spaniards always flatter to deceive; raul and morientes never replicate their club form, they have a plethora of good wingers and midfielders who are just that, good - none in the class of guardiola - mendieta, valeron, joaquin, alonso, vicente, albelda, baraja, they are not really world-class and the defence now is shambles.. ever since hierro and the barca trio of nadal, sergi and abelardo retired; though goalies casillas and canizares are two of the best ever.. luis enrique was really good, and xavi is not getting a look in.. shame, that. in the other game russia salvaged some pride beating greece 2-1, but portugal still top group A and greece come through second on goal difference. much as i like the portuguese, they are showing none of the class or flair that led them to being called the brazil of europe.. they are patchy at best, and christiano ronaldo is too much of a showman.. where are the workhorses?? where are the rui costas and paulo sousas who complement the luis figos? where are the stable fernando coutos, the effective sa pintos, and the hard-running carlos secratarios and sergio conceicaos.. i fear it is not to be portugal's year again..

      guess what people?! i got an internship!! woohoo!! that  urlLink mga research thingy  i had mentioned yeterday, it worked out.. it's gonna be part of my CPT.. so i'll probably take the next semester off too and work with them!! i spent the whole afternoon bouncing around with joy..   until the italy game that is.. actually until the 82nd minute.. when 'trap' took off  urlLink alex del piero .. one just knew no good was going to come of it.. and sure enough sweden came back to tie 1-1.. i was really really glad that he played so well.. should take some pressure off him.. especially after totti got himself idiotically suspended!! denmark overcame bulgaria 2-0 in the other game.. so italy is barely hanging in there now.. stoichkov was right about the new bulgarian captain stilian petrov, he needs to move to spain or italy.. he'll never develop at celtic!!  we had to go out and party at night, so when going back home, ashish, vipul and i had to pass by Third Base (of course!!).. we had a 'happy meal' each.. for the uninitiated, that is NOT what you get at Mickey-D's.. it's a tequila shot chased by a cold corona.. and it's called the happy meal because one of them in the evening and you're happy the next few hours!! :-)) kelly is out of town, so nate's sis natalie was filling in.. i do have hazy memories of dancing with her on her birthday.. and i do remember she was totally hammered.. so we were trying to refresh each other's memories!! ;-))  went over to mal and nat's place.. opened a bottle of shiraz.. that was ok.. we saved the port wine for later!! nats n sank had plans with dan and jess, and mal didn't feel like pubbing, so it was us boyz again!! by the way, sank better watch out, he's slowly losing his 'boyz' status.. the man has stopped drinking.. or almost!! we demolished a double order of hot wings from Just Pizza.. then when we got back to Third Base it was like all family there.. it's awesome now.. we barely have to buy drinks these days.. the first round went on bo, then john got us the next.. nate did a round of shots.. then bo again.. then natalie.. we had to return the favor though, so we did two for the house.. dodi was there, and so was the hubby, but ash was undaunted, turning on the charm and the pool form in buckets!! after innumerable jack n' cokes, tequila shots, harley davidsons, wild turkeys, and god only knows what else, they finally had to throw us cos it was like 4.30!! john gave us some freebie tshirts too!! yay!! then with dodi and alisha we ended up going to Jim's Steakout after that to settle the munchies, and also cos saying b-bye to dodi was too painful for ash!! we really need to get a tab going there.. this cashflow is a biig issue..  poor poor ash.. after the happy meal we fed him, he was buzzed.. at 8 in the evening when its still light out!! then the glass of shiraz.. by the time we landed at vip's at 12.. he was dazed and just wanted to crash.. but vip n i.. shetani dimaag.. dragged him to third base.. with the lure that we just want one jack n coke each, and he can say hi to dodi (how could he say no to  that !!) then there we kept getting plied with shots.. and dodi kept hovering tantalisingly close enough to him, but the hubby was around too!! steakout mein toh ekdum chippak ke behte the.. aur kaan mein kuch kusur-pusur karey jaa rahey the.. lagey raho mere sher.. or should i say .. mere daw-g!!!

      woke up, saw the rain, and promptly went back to sleep.. ain't life grand!! finally had to wake up.. and decided that i was not going to the lab in the rain - my excuse? i don't have an umbrella!! thursday's at the square also got scrapped as a result!! i mean, for us at least..  had some awesome news in the mail!! the guys i had mailed up at mga research want to speak to me!! so i called them up.. it turned into a telephone interview!! now they wanna see me tommorrow at 2!! woohoo!! it's perfect, not too early either!! my advisor dr. baier told me to just chill out and take it easy, they are very informal and so not to worry at all, just read up on ur material and be cool!! sweet!! i can be cool!! will probably take a pack of camel lights and a sixpack of bud and make a picnic of it!! what say?! ;-))  and now football update.. rooney is my man!! i hate to tell people i told you so, but i told you so!! he came good and whacked swiss ass!! england beat a wrongly-depleted switzerland 3-0.. and then croatia lived up to their mercurial billing by rocking the 'vichy-souiss' boys.. france did recover to make it 2-2.. trezeguet finally came good.. but for all of you who watched the game.. did anyone notice how good zidane  still  is??!! i am very impressed!!

      today was one of those humdrum days which is the bane of bloggers and diarists everywhere.. what do you write about? woke up, went to the lab, did some work, ate some lunch, came home, watched a movie, went to the mall, ate dinner, came home, slept off.. spinning a yarn out of this is one helluva effort..   did some good effective work today though, the microscope and comp are up and running, will make the backup discs tomorrow and start scanning some old germanium samples.. went to north with mal and vipul.. nats and sank finally went to the doctor, and will be contributing around $150 to the nation's medicine coffers (or will they?).. watched part of "mona lisa smile" at mal's place.. i am sorry boys, i have committed the grave sin of watching a chick-flick.. but it was already running, and to my credit it didn't draw too much of my attention either!! besides, i watched "munnabhai MBBS" after that to restore some of my faith in film as a form of entertainment!! went to boulevard mall with mal and nat's sis-in-law priya.. and ended up buying so much shit.. i am so ashamed of myself!! :-((   spoke to davo in rolla, it's been ages.. the poor man is stuck there trying to get done with his undergrad.. apparently he spoke to anne sometime recently.. anne.. leo hata mimi nimeona.. haya ni mapenzi gani?? ya maovu tu.. ati sasa umenikatsia tu??!! sasawa.. kaa tu poa.. mpaka nifike NC you better 'play me on the low'..  euro is getting hotter and hotter.. greece have shown they're a team of true mettle.. otto rehhagel has instilled some of that bayern munich grit in them.. they held a rampaging spanish 'G-Unit' to 1-1.. is this finally the year for the matadors and conquistadors?? portugal finnally got going with a 2-0 over russia.. the 'golden generation' refuses to go out with a whimper.. figo played an awesome game belying his age, and embattled ac milan captain rui costa came on as a sub to score too..

      woke up early, and decided i didn't wanna do any work, so promptly went back to sleep.. did eventually get up and finish up debugging the goddamn comp.. had gotten infected by the 'coolwebsearch' spybot.. had to go through the registry weeding out the regitsry entries.. damned trojan hijacks your web-browser and makes its own search engine the homepage..spoke to the landlord today.. he will give us 33 heath for the same rent.. niiice!! we should be inking that deal soon (touch-wood).. and that is one helluva party-house, perfect distance from everything - everything that matters that is:  On The Run, Third Base, Kenmore Liquors, Tops, Aldi..  did i miss anything people? is anyone holding their breath waiting for me to say school??? hehehehe!!  started work on my webpage on the engineering website..  urlLink www.eng.buffalo.edu/~smittra  .. i will need to learn a hefty bit of html and stylesheets to make it look even half decent!!  latvia gave the underdog-supporters something to cheer about, but czech republic's experience told as they came back to win 2-1; nedved is one helluva playmaker.. watching the holland-germany game was weirder than yesterday.. the audio track was 2:32 behind the video!! even the soccernet scoreboard was faster than the audio.. so it was kinda cool as i could tell who was getting substituted even before the bbc boys knew!! ;-) it did look like a nice, open game, ending 1-1: not what you would expect from these two teams!! the german youth brigade looks awesome, the next world cup in germany in 2006 should be good for them - schweinsteiger, kuranyi, ernst, lahm..  finally finished watching 'hey ram'.. it's an epic!! quite an eye-opener on indian history though.. does anyone know if it's a true story?? the pistons nailed the coffin and sent the lakers packing today 4-1.. wow, what were the odds!! my heart goes out to malone and payton.. passing up the big bucks for the championship ring, and yet it eludes them..   the plans seem to be falling in place for a massive RSF reunion in early august.. shiv will be back from his internship in amazon, and will most likely be making it to buffalo around 11th aug; arul should be landing here on 1st aug and ranj will be here around then too - pinku better get his hirsute personality up here then too!! spoke to smi today too after ages.. her parents left today after a whistle-stop US tour.. could i have the niagara falls pics?! don't worry about that f**king advisor, just give me his name and i shall add him to the database of "desi-profs-in-US-who-are-asshole-advisors-stringing-you-along".. justice shall be served to them too honey!!

      rushed down to the lab, set up the computer and then inventoried the microscope and its parts, then ran back home - italy vs denmark at 12!! the viewing arrangements reeked of desperation: some live kuwaiti channel streaming on a 1" by 1" media player screen, which i had to mute to avoid the arab gobbledegook, and listen to the bbc commentary of the game on net radio - it was tough enough to distinguish the two teams jerseys, and added to that was the phase lag of 23 seconds that the video was behind the audio track!! it wasn't worth the trouble either.. the azzurri were miserable in grinding out a scoreless draw.. and mr. del piero was non-existent.. henrik larsson showed why the swedish royal family and 80,000 swedish soccer fans signed a petition urging him to come out of retirement by scoring two and making two as they hit bulgaria 5-0.. the days of hristo stoichkov seem so long gone now.. tomorrow holland-germany should be fun..  radical shift in reading pattern - moved to pg wodehouse now.. enough of sergeant mcnab's grim humour.. one must say that there is something flippant and light in the way mr. wodehouse presents to us bertie wooster and jeeves; indeed, refreshing would be a word not uncommon to most of his writings. went to check out 102 heath.. $550 is a bit too much for that three-bedroom, though there is the added incentive of two girls moving in downstairs!! got drenched for my troubles too, damned evening thunderstorms!!   i felt i had to make a comment to RSF about sv's missive to the group: he seems to have lost his excellent grammatical prowess in his 'sanyas'!! i quote his mail in full -   hi guys its me ...S V  (correct me if i'm wrong , but wasn't that shiv's line?? it's me, shiv!!)  how r u guys and somebody tell me what the hell is happening with this shavi and this sneha gal???? byee ps:....abi thendi chette ... u were suposed to call me     shiv ... same to u   and there the hell is that grizly bear dissappeared to  (someone please explain this line to me!!)  SV   by the way sv, i'm just kiddin u man.. i supposed we should be grateful that you wrote in the first place!!!

      U2 must have written the song on a godforsaken sunday like this one.. cloudy, gloomy, morose, lazy.. so many words to describe it. euro2004 is off to a cracker, and i can't watch it either.. :-(( portugal got a can of greek, souvlaki-flavored whoop-ass opened in their faces yesterday, while spain was business as usual over russia - finally they get over their slow-start jinx. croatian guns and swiss cheese battled to a draw, though one did get the feeling that the swiss were mighty relieved to get a point.. hot damn!! england-france!! what a game!! what a comeback!! those people writing zidane off better start finding a rock to go crawl under!! eng could do with more stability and strength - rooney, rooney rooney, what will come of you my boy.. i am still counting on you though!   went and saw a house on 82 merrimac, looked okay.. but 180 pp is still a lot man.. so we just tossed the football around and came home and settled in.. very sad kinda day.. finally made the pork chops in the oven - note: 45 minutes at 350F is too long!! we were too lazy to go downtown again.. so just hung around..  chilled out at vipul's and listened to lakers getting whupped by the pistons - finally finished the mcnab.. same story as usual of him getting royally f**ked over..

      had an awesome and elaborate barbecue last night.. made some pretty good stuff.. corn-on-the-cob, hot dogs, mixed veggies, fish steaks, pork chops.. sank, vipul, ashish, mal, nats, her sis-in-law priya and bro aditya, jessica (+ her guitar!) and a frnd pranay.. got some beer too, and played some good music too.. overall fun time!!  everyone was still kinda whacked out and dazed from last nite.. we took some really crazy pics with the black light, and the red bulb too.. hehehe.. had a couple of labatt's finest and leftover dogs and potatoes for breakfast.. which happened at 2 pm, which is still a very early hour of the day to be up and about..   went to the allentown arts festival downtown.. it was pretty amazing.. they had blocked off a mile-or-so section of delaware street, and had art stalls lined up.. it was pretty awesome.. some of the guys had really cool stuff.. me, i dunno much art, so i did get bored after some time.. the  urlLink 'music is art'  concert series was awesome, but i was just too hot n tired to hang around.. tomorrow is courtney love, smile empty soul and klear, so it should definitely be better!! though i just read that courtney was arrested for a DUI, assault and battery charge yesterday night in LA, so i am wondering how she will make it here!! ran into yann and yuri there, long time no see fellas! the french connection seems a bit frayed now that lucie's gone..  chilled out at home in the evening with mr. andy mcnab, ex-SAS, in his latest tale of shit hitting the fan.. liberation day.. i love the way he clearly stated that we are such victims of life's biggest f**kers - lack of information and lack of time!!

      ok.. going with the dark and gloomy day outside.. it has been decided that the time has come to pour vitriol on some certain RSFians.. savals valsa kumar chakkamadatil (aka Agent T aka 'tawla') - if you are online and available, please do us the kind favour of replying, and not signing off when ppl msg u.. u see, i don't really care, but koshy and abi will kill you - you do NOT want Kommando and Lambz getting mad at you!! And then there is our food engineer, pinku - dude.. it's really no point having a cellphone is it man?? i think we used to get to speak to you much more when you did not have the cell!! since you never respond to any other form of media, i guess i will try this way - bunty is in buffalo from 2-11 july, and ranj from 29th july to 14th aug, and arul is flying in on 1st aug, so if you could do us this great honor and maybe come up for a few days? we shall remember this favour that you do for us with everlasting joy and happiness as to how blessed we are! in fact, while we are on this degradation trip (for fans of jerry cantrell, i sincerely apologise! especially to you abi..) arul, where are you!! how was your trip to bangy? and how are your bevy of beauties.. dude, we eagerly await with bated breath!!    went for Thursday at the Square with ashish and mimi.. dudes.. all of u who missed this.. eat your hearts out.. cos magna-fi and fuel just simply ROCK!! magna-fi are opening in every leg of ozzfest this summer, and fuel.. well, fuel need no introduction.. ('hemorrhage-in my hands', 'down', 'shimmer', 'bad day', 'falls on me'..) it was simply mindblowingly amazingly good shit!! and guess what.. that was not even the best part!! the hot chicks there, and the even hotter chicks who were body surfing.. niiice!! yum yum!!  went to  Bobby McGees  with sank, nats, mal and vipul to watch lakers get their yellow asses bitch-slapped all over detroit after that.. sad game.. and then ashish and i had the inspired idea of going to  Third Base .. good call!! met kelly there (she was off-duty today).. i finally got kelly's number today!! :-)) and met her bf too :-(( met her friends dodi and alisha too.. hmm.. dodi(sigh!!).. both ashish and i have gone bonkers over her.. despite her being married 6 years and it being her 29th birthday on saturday.. happy birthday dodi!! kelly has promised to hook us up with some friends of hers if we show up tomorrow.. now we have an excuse to go to  Third Base  tommorow!!! as if we ever needed an excuse to get hammered!! kelly was really sweet; she ended up putting on her tab two beers and i dunno how many shots for me .. there were these pineapple rum shots we had.. dudes and dudettes.. u so wanna try this stuff out!!!  now that i'm good and hammered.. i think it is time to quit this blog while i am still ahead of myself!! g'nite people!!

      it is seriously becoming very tough maintaining this rock n' roll lifestyle!! getting kinda too old for these consecutive all-nighters.. besides i seriously think it's us who keep the  On The Run  in the beer business.. messrs. labatt and budweiser must be paying them bonuses to stay open till 4.. what was supposed to be a chilled out sunday evening turned into a beer marathon.. and we almost got another orange traffic cone to add to vipul's collection.. we did get another photo of us lying on the road though!!  such a typical damned monday.. monday blues should be a medical condition, where the doctor can prescribe a couple of cold beers to fix you up, and yet have it covered by your medical.. that sounds very very ideal by the way.. thank god the weather is compliant.. i had to meet dr. baier in the morning to discuss what direction my thesis is gonna take.. luckily he was on for an early lunch so i only had to meet him at 2!!  damn, suddenly i'm headlong into work!! feels kinda weird, for the last few months not having done any activity whatsoever which requires more mental effort than deciding how much longer the steak should sit on the grill or will it be the 12-pack or the 18-pack.. and suddenly i'm delving into the innards of damned infra-red microscopes!! lesson to be learned here for all: this is what you get for writing tall tales in your resume!! was so whacked out by 4 that i had a glass of white zin and a blue, then crashed for a couple of hours in the evening!!  the reviews have started coming in.. people.. there's a comment link below each post, kindly do drop a line or two when you pass by.. would be nice to hear from you all! as for those who were asking me to write longer stories.. well, i really would, but i'm not doing anything that i could write about.. i refuse to start writing here about " Extremophilic Sensors: Advanced Biosensor Technologies Based on Semiconductor-to-Bacteria Adducts as True Biochips", which is what i am workin' on now.. work should be left at work!!  by the way, for those who don't know about him, rahul phondke is one of the most hilarious characters ever.. his weekly column  urlLink Funnybone  is one of the best ever!!

      what a day yesterday.. went to watch the new Harry Potter.. i liked it, it was kinda more mature than the previous two.. chilled out, then decided to go club-hopping (vipul, nirav, sanketh, natasha, malvika, viki and i), so it was the regular "pizza & wings before you go pub-hopping dinner" from  Just Pizza .. it was kinda quiet on main street, most kids have gone home.. went to  Blu , which was not happening.. so we moved onto  Iberia , where the dj seemed to have a 80s fixation (NB - the bartender there, jen, is hot, but her surprise cocktail was a very limp screwdriver..).. we broke our tradition by not dropping by  Third Base  on the way home.. but people were kinda tired.. vipul's buddy from boston, nirav, was nice and happy, and kept talking, and talking, then the cold pizza got him quiet! i have since been contacted by his lawyer, who vehemently denied his client eats pizza.   so like all other sundays, this was a nice relaxed sunday, chilling out.. watched a movie in the afternoon, then did battle with Rugby 2004.. EA Sports latest offering.. and hung out with vipul n' nirav..

      yes, it's the weekend again!! had a quiet friday night for a change, recharging my batteries after a crazy  urlLink Thursdays At The Square  which ended in a barbecue and many, many beers!!  ranj's friend viki is coming down from rochester for the day.. so this weekend is definitely gonna be off to a flier, though the weather definitely doesn't look like it's gonna co-operate..  it's great i bought the enclosure for the external hard drive.. i finally can access all my  urlLink Friends  episodes as well as all my music, and the most most important thing.. my music videos!! RSFians.. remember the MFCSSOB folder, with the music videos, and friday nights, after  Walds  &  Park .. and we'd pick up some 'greenery' from  Greens , and on to my room.. them were the days boys!!

      we had the most awesome thunderstorm i have seen in years!! buildings shook, trees quivered and mere mortals withered in fear, and i? i slept the sleep of gods! it was amazing.. the Norse believed that during a thunderstorm, Thor rode through the heavens on his chariot pulled by the goats Tanngrisni ("gap-tooth") and Tanngnost ("tooth grinder"), and lightning flashed whenever he threw his hammer Mjollnir. Thor is the son of Odin, the god of war and death, but also the god of poetry and wisdom. Odin can make the dead speak to question the wisest amongst them, and is accompanied by the wolves Freki and Geri, to whom he gives his food for he himself consumes nothing but wine. Odin has only one eye, which blazes like the sun, and his other eye he traded for a drink from the Well of Wisdom, and gained immense knowledge. i like this bloke!! for people interested in this norse mythology,  urlLink click here  for a simple bare bones guide to it all - the scrollbar on the left has the names of all the gods. the site for the  urlLink Encyclopaedia Mythica  is awesome for those really interested.  was chatting with shruti (mohanty) today.. here's  urlLink the link  to some of her marriage pics.. in case you didn't know she married sarthak, an ex-RKite. spoke to ani & george in the UK on the  urlLink skype thingy  today.. bar the phase lag it's pretty cool!  spent pretty much the whole day packing up my shit.. we're finally moving into the new party house at 33 heath!! it is gonna be the house that party legends are written about!! dan and jessie came over and helped us move a lot of the smaller stuff.. then we went off to mal and nat's for dinner..   the original boyz (sank, vip and i) then had a sentimental reunion on the 55 tyler balcony for the last time, as we reminisced the good old year past.. truly we have had some good and some great times here.. and the thousand-plus bottles and cans of beer we've polished off.. and all the barbecuing, the stuff we've talked about, the jokes we cracked and the fun we had.. come snow or sun, we've seen it all on that balcony.. i don't believe it's already a year since i landed up here!! time to move on and write new chapters in the book of life.. sniff sniff ;-))

      woke up very very early to take ranj to the canadian embassy for her visa.. then i rushed back to MAL to finish up the paperwork for my fulltime status and Application To Candidacy.. though i really don't know what the rush is since i have told these people so many times now that i'm in the US i'm not planning to leave for a few years!!  we went to the boulevard mall and then to the prime outlets at niagara falls.. and i think ranj and viki got horribly pissed off with ash, sank and me.. we went wild shopping there.. while they just got dragged along in our slipstream and didn't pick up anything!  we saw the lights and the fireworks at niagara falls, pics will be up soon.. then we went to the Hard Rock there and met up with ranj's uncle and family.. ranj left and viki then pushed off for rochester.. the gang lande up at mal's.. she'd made awesome baked pasta.. then came home and crashed.. really whacked!  just a quick thought - farhina, where are you? if you're reading this mail me or come online sometime!!

      woke up with my ears still ringing and a croaky throat.. 3 concerts in 11 days is the count!! ash had the car still, so dropped off mal at MAL and vip at VIP.. no, vip went to north campus actually.. had brunch at Paula's, then went to boulevard mall to return the Taboo.. which they said they couldn't accept coz it was opened.. damn!     make it a point to read Rahul Phondke's  urlLink Funnybone  this week.. especially if you have ever gone shoe-shopping with any member of the gentler/smarter/weaker/other sex!!  did an awesome job in the afternoon of concentrating and writing out a draft of the thesis abstract.. sent it off to baier, then took a nap.. too much mental effort ;-)) went over to our new house at 33 heath with sank and ash to plan what goes where.. we're inviting nominations from people as to what to name the house - contenders so far are  "The House Of Rock", "Sanitarium"..  please friends feel free to chip in!! and  "sex, drugs, alcohol and rock n' roll"  will not count.. don't want the DEA/cops/feds/traffic police/CIA knocking on our door at 3 in the morning after we paint the name on the door!!  had dinner at mal's n' nat's.. then we had a small macabre film fest, watching Final Destination 1 & 2 back to back! that was fun, as was the walk back home at 2 in the morning.. in the stillness of the warm summer night :-))

      the day dawned cloudy and dreary, but it got hot today, cos  urlLink projekt revolution  has rolled into town.. linkin park, korn, snoop dogg were all here - wooha!! mallika, ash and i went for it at 2. we tailgated until 3 with the tequila of Senor Jose Cuervo, then went in to the revolution stage where some of the smaller sidey bands were playing - we got bored there pretty soon and when the gates to the main stage lawn opened we rushed in!   less than jake   started it off, and weren't too impressive either, and   the used   followed them and they weren't much better either.. at least the opening acts for   nickelback   and   evanescence   were much better, but i guess that was the premise of the projekt revolution.. giving smaller bands a chance to play the big arenas.   finally   snoop dogg   came in and bitch-slapped some ass into shape!! that was good! he got the crowd going in no time.. and it actually wasn't so incongruous getting a gangster rap act on a rock outfit tour!! his version of the "goodbye song" and "next episode" had everyone wild!! he really got the crowd jumping fine for   korn   coming in next..  "are you ready?!" were the words screamed out at the top of jon davies' lungs as he bounded onstage in a black leather kilt and adidas stripes on it!! "korn!! it's on!!"   korn   did some awesome shit, pulling out a whole best-of collection in the one hour they played.. "freak on a leash", "blind" and "falling away from me" deserve special mention!! then they blew everyone away by launching into their MTV Icon version of   metallica's   "one".. and then they really set the roof on fire when they played   pink floyd's   "another brick in the wall", but in their own style, with their seven-string bass and screaming guitars!! jon davies played the bagpipes as well for "shoots & ladders".. in between taking breaks for oxygen 'shots' for his anxiety disorder.. yeah, if you didn't know that! the scary part is that his wife is always standing there side-stage smoking away to glory next to those damned oxygen cylinders!! the wild moshpits we had for korn were scary too!! there were three large ones in the lawn section alone!! loads of people being taken away with gashes, rips, broken noses and various other injuries!!  the crowd was getting restless, feet tired after standing 7 hours all day.. wondering what the heck was taking so long.. then the explosions, and   linkin park   was there!! they had so much freaking energy jumping on and off and all about the stage!! i had watched them in columbus in january, but this time was maaaad!! "it's going DOWN, it's going DOWN!!" they did a couple of freestyle raps from unreleased songs, apart from the regular picks out of hybrid theory and meteora. these guys are amazing live.. simply superb! they didn't have lasers or pyros or shit, just simple lights and good hard ROCK!! we ripped out our throats yet again.. and still had some more in the reserve tanks to usher in the encore.. "crawling" and "one step closer"!! ama-f**kin'-zing show man!!  managed to get lost twice (again!!) on the way back from darien lakes.. landed up at 55 tyler where there was biryani leftovers.. good work nats, sank, mal n' vip.. came home, updated this blog and crashed.. sweet dreams. actually, hard rocking heavy metal dreams.. but sweet in their own way!!

      a friend called me up asking if i wanted to go bird-watching.. the two-legged, two-winged kind.. now it's his idea of a good time to go off with a pair of binoculars and watch some warblers at it, but it's a thing that i can't see any percentage in. when i meet a bird, i wave a friendly hand at it, to let it know i wish it well but i wouldn't crouch behind a bush and observe it perform its daily ablutions!! now i'm starting to sound like bertie wooster!! results of reading p.g. wodehouse..  richard finally gave me the keys to 33 heath lower, but now he seems to be playing cat-n-mouse with the upstairs apartment, and the girls are losing patience.. i dunno what to do either.  it was vipul's birthday tonight.. we got him a pair of glaring golden boxers as his spoof gift, and a ferrari racing black jacket.. which he seemed to totally like.. we got him to 'catwalk' the boxers too!! i am gonna put up those pics under pain of being contacted by his lawyers, but what the hell.. have already sullied any chances of his political career anyways!! kavin, raghu, reddy, adi, vamshi and shashi also popped in at 12.. and got him to parade the boxers.. again!! we had made margaritas and iced-tea-ritas too.. five of those and a couple of joints and i drifted off into the dreamless sleep which i so yearn for.. :-))

      grr.. had to wake up early in the morning to be at the conference by 8.. tucked into a nice well-rounded continental breakfast there.. then slept heartily through the morning presentations.. got up for mine - passed off peacefully, scared the bio people away with the fluid mechanics displays in mine!! - then went for lunch to  urlLink Ulrich's Tavern .. i would encourage everyone to follow the link and read the history of the place.. had awesome bratwurst and sauerkraut, honey mustard buffalo wings and more salad.. and downed two pints of buffalo's own Flying Bison Red Ale.. good stuff.. no chance i was going back to the conference after that, so i came home to 55 and crashed.  chilled out in the evening; had nice looong chats with my cousin ambika(she's seeing this italian guy, and moved outta home finally), shruti(from kgp, telling me about the joys, trials, and tribulations of married life), loretta(smi's room mate - her laptop decided to give up the ghost.. poor girl!! smi has moved to st. louis and bought a ford focus hatchback for 5k!! WOW!!) and ranj(will be flying into buffalo on thursday afternoon), then went over to 55; sank and vip had cooked rajmaha chawal. malvika had coloured her hair blonde, and was showing off the new look - very nice, very nice indeed. julia roberts eat your heart out! azmi and jason were also there, so we had a couple of drinks, and played  urlLink 'Taboo'   after everyone left, kavin came over, and we sampled some more of the pleasures of Ms. Mary-Jane ;-)).. were good and buzzed by 4 in the morning.. crashed then to ths sounds of winamp's "ambient chillout sleep sleep sleep" - this station can really weird you out at times, but otherwise its amazing.

      woke up bright and early today (ok, ok, stop laughing.. it was 9.15!) went to the MAL to finish my poster, then went for the conference - pretty big do it was.. everyone suited out and stuff.. i, in the spirit of kooky biomaterials engineers on a friday - went in jeans, sneakers and white shirt! have to present my goddamn poster tomorrow.. yuck! the speakers were giants in the field and all, but they failed to keep me interested, or awake!! there was an albert einstein impersonation that was funny, but then he started waxing sentimental and i started waxing jim n' cokes.. so all was well again..  the cocktail after the conference was fun.. nice hor d'oeuvres, and free booze!! knocked back a few buds and jim n' cokes in rapid fire :-)) coming back home on the subway with karrishma and ranjini was fuuun after that!! ;-))  passed by 55, helped sank and vip with a bit of the cleaning, passed up on raghu's birthday party at dawg's.. came home, put on pearl jam and crashed.. long day tomorrow too.

      had a nice quiet day today.. was up till 4 last night finishing up my presentation.. woke up around 10, picked mal and went to the MAL (Malvika's Architecture Library)!! ;-)) well, so many of us hang out there these days that it's like she's the bartender out there! wouldn't it be so cool if you could go to a library and have a drink and chill out with a book? barnes & noble, are you listening? cos that is definitely the way to go!! i would like 35% of all profits in that venture if you don't mind, and another 35% to mal for all the times we have been in her lib and disturbed her and almost got her fired too!!  finished my presentation, must say it looks pretty awesome by all engineering and med. school standards.. though all my archi. and planning friends would beg to differ.. only problem is that i gotta be up and running at 10 tomorrow morning.. what crap man.. there's gotta be a law against this!!   had dinner at home for a change today - how could i not, mayank had made puris!! ash and i went to Third Base at 11.. sorry man, no dodi tonight either.. though natalie made quite an entry in a short strappy black number!! yeeha!! ash got stuck playing 5 games of pool with eddie (people, remember eddie, the weird roommate chandler had in  urlLink Friends Episode 217 ?? well, similar bloke!!) nate did us good with a couple of free 'puckschlagers' at the end.. we called it quits early.. saving up energies for the weekend.

      had to get up early today for the meeting with the board of MGA Research Corp. at dr. baier's office.. that went off pretty well.. and once this is passed by the board, i should be swimming in the moolah again.. ok, wading, ankle deep, not exactly swimming, but it's still money. did a little more work on the poster for the conference. saw the schedule for the conference, there's food every two hours for two days!! i can do with that!!   went back to north campus today for the first time in.. in.. wow.. the last time i went to north campus on work was in april!! scanned in a few pics for the poster in my old haunt - jarvis 310.. the secretaries are still there, as charming as ever ;-)).. carol, linda and bonnie!! even wangled some color printouts for the poster off them!! came home and had a bucket of buffalo wings for a late lunch, and watched  'Charas' .. good movie that.. it had a version of  'The Beach' , set in the mountains... sounds awesome.. vip, gandhi, kya bolta hain, yaha se kamaleyte thoda rokra phir jaakey settle hojatey hain?!  got pissed off by Bull on 103.3 The Edge today.. he went on and on about how he found soccer to be the most boring sport ever etc.. WHAT!! just cos soccer games may end 0-0 doesn't mean that it's a boring game. i'll tell you what's boring - baseball's boring. oh yeah, now we are talking booooring!! and even though i hate the sport.. the Yanks still rule!! anytime, especially over the Red Sox (nirav start calling your lawyer!!) talking of lawyers, vip will be calling his too very soon.. he thinks i am ruining his chances of running for president with the daily revelations i make about him.. i think all my lawyer will say is "look at the incompetent, deceiving nincompoop currently in charge" - am sure vip cannot do much more harm than him!!  went over to mal's for dinner - ash, nats and mal had made aloo parathas - yum yum!! had nice long phone conversations with bunty (all systems go for the RSF august reunion), rupi (he's doing great, busy with work & arathi is in assam now) and smi (her co-op thingy finally came through, so she's moving to st. louis until dec, congrats honey!)

       sorry this took so long to put up.. but here it is finally.. the account of the road trip we went on last week. also see the pics in the side bar!!   all set for the road trip.. we did get stuck with a stupid small car (chevy aveo) for a while, but then got the dodge neon... bright red in colour.. a little cramped, but will do.. ash, sank, vip, mal and i.. left around 10 on thursday night.. the time in the car was hilarious.. kept on cracking jokes.. ash and sank did most of the driving.. went the harrisburg PA route to get to baltimore at around 6 in the morning.. drove past the bayside area to get to the marriott where vip's sis deepti works.. she took us to her apartment.. we showered and cleaned up, and ate samosas and parathas.. heavenly!! we relaxed for a bit, then went out to walk around the bay area there.. beautiful and warm.. feels great to be out of buffalo!!  drove to washington then.. and got a bit stuck in the crazy traffic.. we'd left b'lo without our atlas.. so struggled manfully with the yahoo maps.. did get a little lost in a 5 block by 5 block area.. in washington d.c. downtown proper.. it was very irritating, knowing exactly where you are, but at the same time not being where you were supposed to be.. got there, setlled down in the afty, then vip's friends rahul and purva showed up, and we went to 'The Mall'.. and no people, that is NOT the shopping area.. but this mile-long or so strip which has the LIncoln Memorial, Washington Monument on one end, and Capitol Hill on the other - in between are most of the major museums in the area.. pretty awesome place, just that we got tired of walking.. especially after having been on the move all last night.. the White House was also there somewhere.. spoke to aditya saini.. but didn't get a chance to meet him.. at night we met a friend of sank's - thomas and his gf, and we all went out partying in d.c. - area called adam's morgan.. which is a 2-block area with an amazing number of clubs, pubs n restaurants in it.. pretty amazing place.. had dinner at an ethiopian place, then went dancing to a latino club.. but after that we were really knackered, so we walked down the strip, and went and chilled out at the Marriott we were staying at.  next morning we were up bright and early.. a little earlier than necessary thanks to some people's watch alarms!! (grr!!) another one of vip's friends, rishi came over and we drove to blacksburg.. successfully getting stuck in the traffic the I-81 is so famous for.. we got into VTech around 4 ish, and went to ash's friend anamika's place.. had a late lunch, chilled out for a bit then went out to the downtown.. it was a pretty small downtown, just 2 blocks and 4 pubs.. but ok nonetheless.. danced like crazy and were pretty wired up by the time Woody's closed at 2.. so we moved the party to shiv's house.. who is in seattle!! his roomies rohan and bhushan are actually sank's college-mates.. so we took out our stock of scotch and vodka which we carried on our travels.. and got busy!!   woke up on sunday morning arnd 9ish.. really groggy and fuzzy.. we were up till arnd 5 drinking, then got home and crashed.. after breakfast we drove up to this place called Claytor Lake, a pretty little lake, where we chilled out and relaxed the day away.. they had a little artificial sand beach, and we played some beach volley too.. and i spent more time diving around preventing the ball landing on pretty people in bikinis and getting sand on them!! fun times! had an early dinner and piled into the car for the ride back.. the return route was via pittsburgh, though we were quite sure the temple there wouldn't be open at 3 in the morning, so we didn't stop there!!

      firstly, happy birthday shiv (when you buying out amazon?), and happy birthday malvika (you shall always be 21)!! hope you have a completely awesome year!!   woke up dazed and confused around 10.. then we all went to the temple. yes my doubting and atheistic friends, i went to the temple. and i don't mean Third Base either.. though that is also a pilgrimage site for me of sorts!! ;-)) had a nice lunch there, then we just hung out since the weather was kinda crappy.. the concert was at 6.30..  urlLink nickelback  and  urlLink three doors down  were the headliners,  urlLink puddle of mudd  and  urlLink 12 stones  opening. this had to be amazing since i really liked 3 of the big bands playing today!! i was planning to get good and done before that.. so had some three smirnoff double screwdrivers.. then vip and i smoked up too.. by the time we got there at 5.30 i was totally tripping!! we had a pair of vodka shots each to fortify against the rain, then out we went!! wooha!!  12 Stones were ok.. i remember just one song of theirs  'broken' .. but at least they got the heads bouncing! then came on puddle of mudd!! they had some lights and fireworks, but their music was what totally rocked.. they played stuff from both their albums..  'control', 'drift & die', 'nobody told me', 'she f**kin' hates me', 'blurry', 'away from me', 'heel over head', 'spin you around' .. they did an awesome jam during 'control', going into black sab's 'war pigs' in it!! my throat was already gone by the time they were finishing up!!   people were smoking up all around us.. it was such an awesome concert atmosphere.. then the lasers came on.. and with them were 3 Doors Down!! now this band kicked serious ass, when everyone thought they were all about soppy ballad-rock.. they had the on-stage split-screens, flame-throwers and fireworks.. along with the lasers too.. it was amazing!!  'kryptonite', 'loser', 'be like that', 'the better life', 'when i'm gone', 'away from the sun', 'the road i'm on', 'here without you', 'changes', 'this time' .. in the middle when the band was taking a break, the drummer did this amazing solo.. giving it all he had.. crrrazy!! when they were done everyone was wondering how nickelback would top that performance!  they did, oh yes they did!! these freaking canadians (nickelback that is!) were jumping around the stage like monkeys on magic mushrooms!! chad kroeger kept telling the crowd to take out their joints and smoke them up.. NOW!! they were a loud band.. and even though chad sometimes went into scream mode.. it still kicked even more serious ass.. they had mindblowing pyros on stage.. which were perfectly synced with the music.. very very cool!! they didn't play too much from their first two albums, giving more coverage to 'Silver Side Up' and 'The Long Road'..  'leader of men', 'worthy to say', 'breathe', 'never again', 'how you remind me', 'too bad', 'someday', 'figured you out', 'feelin' way too damn good'  and of course  'hero'  from the spiderman soundtrack!  we got stuck in bad traffic getting out of darien lakes, but got home around 1-ish.. met nats (she came in around 7 in the evening), then went home, had a couple of drinks with vip, smoked up and slept.. with the amps still blaring in our ears and rock burning in our brains!! :-)) this is becoming one very very memorable summer, and this weekend was definitely one of the best ever in my life!!

      ash and i got up early on saturday at pinku's, then went to have breakfast at lopa's.. hadn't seen her in ages.. she was looking very nice.. :-)) we started back at 10.. and ash drove like a demon.. we were back in buffalo at 3, with breaks and all!! at one point he did get his balls in the vice though when a state trooper slowly crept up on us!!  mal was blissfully unaware of the surprise party for her tonight! ash and i took her to Dairy Queen to throw her off the scent.. then in the evening vip told her he was taking her out.. and he had no idea where the rest of us were.. then he brought her to 55 tyler.. where jason, azmi, ash, sank and i were waiting.. with her birthday cheesecake and 75 jello shots!! one hour and 75 jello shots later.. jason made mudslides.. and vip n' i smoked up too.. and it was all sooo good!!   we then went to Third Base at 12.. when it actually did become mal's birthday.. and nate was there.. so we did get a good amount of shots into us again.. freaking awesome night!! we kept going 'happy birthday happy birthday lalalaa'.. just to see mal blush.. heheh!!

      chilled out day today.. recovering from the excesses of the weekend.. there's lots of work to be done, but it can wait until i am back to my regular verve.. though we were discussing yesterday that it has been quite sometime since we last showed up at Third Base.. by the way, heard that nats was really pissed off that we went on a road trip without her.. she's in california, in case anyone's wondering.. sounds to me a classic case of  "Hello, Pot? This is Kettle here, you're black!!"  we 6 all then had a nice long conference chat in the afternoon.. she will be back this weekend.  chatted with garima today after what must be months.. she is really not enjoying the start to her last year of college in ahmedabad.. not helped at all by it being a dry state, so i called her up and we talked for ages.. she should be coming over next year for her masters - now  that  is something definitely worth looking forward to!!  went over to dawg's place for pau-bhajji dinner.. excellent stuff.. which just reminds me i have not cooked in over two weeks.. then we went over to Third Base, but it looked kinda dull, so we went over to drop mal, sat around at her place for a bit.. then came home and crashed with a Max Brand Western.. its been ages since i read a cowboy novel!

      first and foremost, my sincerest apologies to all my friends and faithful readers for the barrage of vitriol yesterday.. i was just in a very pissed off mood.. will try to ensure that never happens again..   was gaurav puri's b.day yesterday.. we threw him a surprise barbeque party at 55 tyler.. had loads of beer, bacardi and black label.. and corn, potatoes, hotdogs and chicken too.. quite a few people landed up.. puri, ashish, parag.. then sank, vip, mal and me.. mallick, guri, malika, sam, payal, anjali, gaurav chetna, gautam.. raghu, reddy, dude kumar.. reddy and puri were dead drunk by the end at around 3ish.. it was oen of those memorably wild drunken parties!! had a good amount to drink last night.. sank and i were sitting around and cursing after everyone left since we wanted to drink more and there was no alcohol to be found anywhere.. then slept around 6ish.. and was up at 9 too.. very very pissed.. hence the outpouring of anger in the previous posting.. am ok now though.. thanks to everyone for their support.  had an uneventful day at the lab.. finished up with the work i was doing in the architecture dept., and met karrishma today after what must be ages.. went to vip's and finished off what was left of the amazing marinated chicken that gautam had brought yesterday.. dropped mal off home.. passed by Third Base, said 'hi' to nate, then walked home like a good boy.. did chill out with some scotch after that, working on my thesis abstract - i need to prepare it so that i can file for candidacy. might have to work on it on my laptop in virginia though.. oh yeah, forgot to mention this.. the 'brownie boyz'(vip -  brown nigger , sank -  brown neck , ash -  brown dawg  and i -  brown trash ) plus mal are going on a road trip on thursday to baltimore, washington d.c. and virginia. poor poor malvika, stuck with a bunch of crazy drunks!!   the florida pics are finally up!! see the sidebar!!

      again staggered out of bed around 10 and landed up at the falls.. this time to do the Cave of the Winds walk.. which was awesome fun too.. more drenching was in order at the Hurricane Deck.. for those who do not know about this.. you gotta come here and do it for yourself!! we then went to the outlet mall at niagara falls.. generally walking around and buying even  more  clothes.. we then had lunch there.. and bunty's aunt and cousin picked him up from there.. will see him in a week's time.. then we came back to buffalo.. pinkz, ram and venky packed up and left around 6.. and there came to an end the mini-reunion.. which was supposed to be the appetizer to the real deal happening in august..   and now the really juicy bits that everyone in RSF wants to know about!! pinku is not as fat as everyone thinks/wants him to be!! he's a bit on the plump side, but it's nothing a month's gymming (or a bossy gf!!) can't take care of!! and bunty.. well.. bunty is now going to be called 'phattu' by all of us.. because daroo dekh ke hi 'phat jati hain'!! c'mon bunty, you were supposed to sit with us and get stone drunk.. like them good ol' first year walds days!! what happened??   chilled out in the evening.. watched 'Mumbai Matinee' at my place with vip n sank.. we cooked up some stuff.. made a few screwdrivers.. and had a nice quiet sunday-evening-type nights.. it's very nice being normal again.. after having spent the last week in a stoned-happy, drunk-blurry daze.. but those days had their merits to!!  aargh.. back to work tomorrow.. i will not manage this well at all!! after the amount of non-stop partying that we have been doing the last few days, mundane tasks like seeing my bank manager, returning books to the library (novels, to the public library, before anyone of you start getting weird ideas about me, textbooks, and college libraries!!), meeting my graduate secretary.. and even worse.. going to the lab and doing some work!! :-0!!

      somehow woke up and made it to niagara falls around 12ish.. packed to the gills with poeple.. 90% of them of indian origin.. the falls have become like an american pilgrimage place.. a sort of haridwar or something!! had a nice ride on the Maid of the Mist.. grabbed subs, then rushed back home to watch the Euro 2004 final.. what a drab game.. i don't begrudge the greeks their title.. but yeesh!! play football man!!  after the game, we all caught some much needed shut-eye.. knocked back a few of killian's best red beer.. then went for the Goo Goo Dolls concert.. it was some of the saddest weather ever.. raining buckets and windy too.. by the time the goos started we were all drenched.. and when they finally kicked in.. it was like we were watching the show  in  the niagara falls, not in niagara square!! and staying thorugh the storm was so totally worth it.. 'iris' was amazing.. rain and all.. and testament to the buffalonians party spirit, the show was fully packed right up to the fireworks display at the end!! thank god the rain let up in the end so that we could enjoy the fireworks.. that was also really awesome..  came back home and got out of the wets, then ate at Lake Effect.. which is so much like the diner in Archie comics.. then went to 55 tyler and had a couple of drinks, smoked up some stuff.. and chilled out playing cards.. finally crashed at around 6..

      i love wednesdays.. they are a welcome break after two boring weekdays. and they herald the beginning of the  'Buffalo Weekend' .. did some cleanup work in the morning, don't even ask how.. after vip n i slept at 6ish eventually!! then we called it a day to go watch the euro semi-final between portugal and holland.. good game that, the hosts winning 2-1.. and figo totally deserved his man-of-the-match award.. holland looked nothing short of wretched.. and i will not be sad to see the backs of them..   hung around after that at sank's then went to mal's.. then we decided to catch 'Spiderman-2' at 10 since it was opening day.. we were quite a big crowd for the movie.. sank, nats, jason, azmi, dan, jessie, ash, gaurav, mal and i.. the movie was not too bad.. it was kinda mature in fact.. but of the three possible places they could end it, they chose the third.. and that rankles a bit.. it turned into a 2hr 15 min epic!!  landed up at Third Base after that with jason, azmi, ash and mal.. the regular crowd was there as usual doing what they do best.. ash and i finally left nicely-buzzed around 2.30.. bunty and pinku should be coming in on friday.. and that promises to be fun!!

      going back to the point i raised a few days ago - too many blogs i read these days are tinged with emotion, sentiment and memories. every one's asking questions, of others, of themselves.. of what we are.   i know what i am. i am sick of judging, and being judged. i am tired of having to live conforming to standards. and easy as it is for people to say  "break free, live your own life!" , no one really does. we pretty much do what we have to do, what we are supposed to do, but rarely what we want to do. i can rarely do what i want to do. and things almost never go the way i want them to. i derive my strength from helping people with their problems, in what is probably a selfish streak of wanting to take parts in everyone's lives. i want control. i want to control. so judge me now! let's hear it!!  i am tired of seeing good people.. my friends usually.. being hurt. i am tired of seeing them being hit by pretty much everything that can go wrong. and i am tired of seeing them battered and bruised, but still struggling to smile and put up brave faces. the scariest thing of it all is that when all is falling apart around me, my little world is still holding up. and all i can think is how long? those favored by fortune say  'touch wood' , those upon whom divine light shines, say  'praise the Lord' , those who epitomise action over words say  'it is but karma' , and i? i say  'we live to fight another day. thank you all'     mindless ramblings seem to be flavor of the week with my postings.. this is nice. i get to say so much, yet say nothing.. except to those who hear what they want to hear here, and to those too who hear what they don't want to hear - for them i say something. and it is upto them to understand what it means to them.   a quick shout out to the boys of RSF - see you all very very soon in buffalo!! let the games begin!! the meat will roast, the alcohol flow freely, and the women.. c'mon guys.. pull your own chicks!! i can't do  everything  for you!!

      time speaks for itself. it needs no introduction, and controls itself. when space and time meet, thought is unleashed. it's free, free to roam as it pleases, free to do as it pleases.. free. night is beyond the meeting of space and time. the nexus of the thought process. night is when belief is suspended, when the unthinkable occurs. mere mortals fall by the wayside at night. those who revel in it draw innate power from it's dark confines.  the same great innate power which brings with it the sword of Damocles hovering above your head, the sword of great responsibility.

      for me every day of the week has started taking some kind of meaning nowadays:   monday:  another weekend down the drain.. time to make a fresh start.. do something meaningful this week   tuesday:  good intentions remain exactly that, good intentions.. targets for the week are hastily recalculated and meetings rescheduled   wednesday:  *big sigh of relief* halfway down the week, the last two days cannot be that bad at all.. somehow this day always whizzes right by me   thursday:  by default we land up at Third Base at night.. so i know whatever happens during the day it will all end well   friday:  will actually do some work cos i always catch my advisor on fridays.. and he keeps scaring me with how far he thinks my work can go!   saturday:  glad that another week has passed without any major dramas, and i still have full use of all my bodily functions.. usually my most inspired day too   sunday:  the one day that everyone sleeps in, i can't! invariably, for some reason or the other, i will be up and about, bright and early on sunday mornings.. and i will be waxing philosophical about the week ahead

      the weekend was so wasted.. in all possible senses of the word.. these days i seem to work on the weekends, and cruise the week.. which is not a bad thing at all, only that everyone else is doing the regular workday schedule..   high praise indeed from  urlLink reshma ; thank you very much! will try to make all posts live up to that ideal.. but the problem's it's kind of tough to replicate the exact chemical stimulation that my brain was on that night! ;-))   one thing is for sure.. am definitely getting too old for this rock n' roll lifestyle we're living! one starts wondering where it'll all end, when it'll all end, how it'll all end.. where do you draw the line as to how hard you party? how much alcohol do you wanna drink? how much do you wanna smoke? hmm.  saturday nite we had smoked up then went to chill out at Paula's.. then came back and was up for more with vip till around 5.. woke up to go to work at 10.. fixed up the archi. dept. straight through till 5.. was so bushed when we came home that i made a twisted screwdriver, had a few sips and crashed flat till 9!   went over to 265 and had pizza and wings with the girls.. and drank up some more.. wasn't really interested in watching 'frida', though it had salma hayek.. so came home, adi and gang landed up too.. after all the dust had settled, vip and i were tripping watching the screen saver thingy on media player, with floyd playing.. beautiful.. i remember having some deep intense thoughts at that time, and i knew that i should have written it down then, cos i was going to forget them.. and guess what, i did forget!!   calling out to my favourite stewardess! farhina! where are you! call me! or come online!   song of the day:  'Home' - Three Days Grace

      my life seems to be revolving around clouds now.. the clouds over buffalo, the clouds of smoke enveloping my nights, the clouds surrounding my internship, the clouds covering my research, the clouds in my head and my mind, the clouds, the clouds.. been reading quite a few blogs, and everyone seems to be doing an introspective soul-search or the like.. and i wonder why?   watched 'The Terminal' the other day, and was really struck by what Catherine Zeta-Jones said to Tom Hanks about the locket that Napoleon gave to Josephine on their wedding - in it was inscribed  'destiny' , and that struck me as amazing. of all the things he could have had engraved, maybe cheesy things like their names, or 'love always' or some other sentimental bullshit, he had 'destiny'. beautiful. think about that, and chew on it. i haven't been able to get over that for days now.. how poignant, yet perfect.  went to the archi. dept. to continue with the set-up work.. then came home in the evening, showered and chilled out with a beer. for those who haven't tried this yet.. get a chilled beer, and drink it while soaking your aching shoulders under a hot shower.. and man will you thank your lucky stars for the little pleasures that life affords us every day.  went for a long relaxing walk with mal in the evening.. we went everywhere yet nowhere.. one thing must be said about the summer evenings.. nothing is more cathartic than just walking and taking the mickey.. i know the day will come, very soon too.. when we'll look back and hark the days of yore (actually the days of college!!) reminiscing on the carelessness of it all..   ash and i dropped mal home, then passed by kenilworth liquors on the way back, and the deed was done - smirnoff twisted raspberry and ballantine's scotch! made a screwdriver using the shaker we bought at chili's.. very comfortable this.. making cocktails and shots at home using the shaker!!

      again got up early and went to school with arul.. he had to meet a couple of profs.. then went and hung out with karrishma at starbucks for a couple of of hours or so.. after that i had to meet dr. baier, who gave me an hour-long individual lecture on what direction my thesis should take.. aargh!! but finally i can see exactly what i should be doing with my research work - and now that i know that, i can chill out for another couple of weeks while i "ponder the intricacies of microbiofouling in microfluidic devices"!! ;-))  arul is either still suffering from jet lag or has turned into one lazy bugger!! all he does is sleep!! though he does sometimes sample the pleasures of night-time HBO!! we're still on communal cooking mode, so sank and i whipped up dinner, then we watched 'The Terminal'.. arul spoke to shiv and pinku finally..  the gang (nats, sank, ash, arul n i)then went to Third Base.. it was thursday after all.. and now here's a newsflash for RSF - arul had his first drink!! we had 'mint chocolate chip' shots all around.. arul seemed done after that, so he didn't drink anymore.. now where is the doubting 'thomas' who boldly proclaimed that this was going to be beyond me :-P we got back around 1.30ish and crashed.. i could do with a decent night's sleep, vip and ash are both kinda sick, and arul's just being plain lazy while sank and nats need sleep more than oxygen, or alcohol it seems!!  finally, a quick shout out to david (davo)!! for those who do not understand swahili, please skip. davo, jamaa, finally, a holla out to you in rolla.. and manze, vile umeni threaten and stuff, that aint cool.. na wewe, kwani it's how tough tu just wacha a comment for the masses?!

      yeah, the title says it all!! that's what we've been doing since yesterday.. setting up the house and finding place to put all the stuff we dumped in it! everyone has pretty much got their rooms in shape, but the kitchen will need quite some work! we have like 4 different sets of every spice under the sun.. and while that is not a bad thing at all, it is quite a pain since the chilli powders decide to stick together and go missing in one nook of the kitchen cupboard, while the garam masalas have also formed a separate league of their own, and don't even talk about the cloves and cardamoms! we did a shopping trip to Aldi and got two cartfuls worth of supplies.. our refrigerator is already complaining and last time we checked it was contemplating writing a letter to the Secretary of State for Labor!  small world eh, georgie's mom was arul's teacher in school! she sent a parcel for him via arul, so georgie came over. he's done with his defense so he's joined the job search market.. ash made awesome daal, and nats and mal had also come over for dinner.. so we had a small dinner party.. though the girls seemed more interested in watching 'Sex And The City'..   i keep meaning to call it an early night every night, but stuff keeps coming up and i end up crashing around 2ish invariably.. was kinda dazed and sleepy all day today.. will definitely catch myself a small siesta tomorrow.

      came across a very interesting article today..    Michael Schumacher has agreed to take on the current rally world champion Sebastien Loeb in December's Race of Champions. The rally-based event will take place at the Stade de France in Paris on a one kilometre, figure-of-eight track.   Schumacher has previously avoided meddling in other forms of motor sports but has had a change of heart and insists he is looking forward to the event. "I'm really looking forward to it, it looks a lot of fun," said Schumacher. Promoter Michele Mouton said: "We're thrilled he accepted our invitation. Rally drivers will not want to lose to a circuit driver."    that sounds very cool, but what really piqued my interest here was the name michele mouton. she was the fastest woman in rallying back in the early 80s, and no doubt one of the hottest too!! click on this  urlLink link  for a quick bio. this is what she looks like  urlLink now , trying out the audi nuvolari quattro concept car. this name takes me back to the grand old days of the world rally championship (WRC), when it was still about endurance and car conservation and not the trade plied by the speed merchants today.. the  urlLink audi quattro was the meanest sonofabitch on the roads, and it was driven by  urlLink hannu mikkola , walter rohrl & michele, while peugeot had just gotten out their  urlLink 205 T16  under  urlLink ari vatanen  &  urlLink juha kankkunen .. and the strongest car by far was the  urlLink toyota celica twincam turbo  driven by  urlLink bjorn waldegaard .. good old days.    back then the Safari Rally held in kenya was a 5 day event; unlike what it is  urlLink today , it was over 5,000 kilometers in length, and it had the name "the toughest rally in the world".. still is, actually.  urlLink the 50th Safari  was held last year following the original format of kenya, uganda and tanzania in the route.. the driver who won was never the fastest guy, always the smartest guy. bjorn waldegaard, juha kankkunen, local boys  urlLink rob collinge , shekhar mehta and vic preston junior... these were the smart guys.. while ari vatanen, hannu mikkola, walter rohrl, timo salonen & markku alen were the blazers.   some of my most vivid childhood memories of the kenyan countryside were of the safari.. we'd go and camp out in the bush for the period of the rally.. in vast endless savannah plains, with a single rutted dirt track snaking through it.. and a rally car whizzing in from the distance.. trailing clouds of dust behind it.. an orange sunset blazing above the green-brown canopy of thorn acacias that lined the horizon.. a herd of elephants somewhere in the distance trumpet at the intrusion by the turbocharged cars.. giraffe nonchalantly chewing away at the baobab twigs.. antelope grazing shyly, at a respectful distance from the road, casting nervous glances at the thicket behind.. where lions could be lurking, and hyenas behind them, cackling their evil laughs.. yes, those were the days *sentimental flashback memory of home*.. finally,  urlLink here is a link  (click the red tab on the left side that says "TTE's Images", then click on Safari) to some awesome images from the Toyota Team Europe (TTE) site for the '99 Safari, which was special to me as it was eth last Safari i saw before leaving kenya..
