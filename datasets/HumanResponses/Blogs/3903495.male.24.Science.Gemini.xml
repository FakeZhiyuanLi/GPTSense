        An old hurt lay burried between me and a friend of mine, watered with silence, fertilized by time. It grew strong, as much hurts do, when left neglected by&nbsp; forgiveness.      I used to watch it grow between us. We are the one that planted it but I did continualy sought a way to uproot the ugly old thing. However pity me for not finding the only balm that can heal our hurts.      A time did come when I finally get it, in the midst of our hurts , I stop dead in my tracks and somewhere the voice in my&nbsp;head cried out ENOUGH! ENOUGH fighting and crying or struggling to hold on to this friendship bond that I once treasured and gamble my trust on.      Now, there's no more silence between us, there's fake laughter fooling all the audience that we are still good friends. Mimicking the character of what friends always seems to be like. But still deep inside us, I think we're torn apart, deep in our hearts, the silence is still there. Our heart never spoken anymore the language that we once familiar with.      The wall between us both is too thick that can never be torn easily. But still my friend I do care about you, trust me I still do. Please take a good care of your own self because you are precious to many of us. May Allay bless us and live to the fullest as I will always pray for our happiness though in the silence between us.

      This book touches a lot of people in ways they wouldnt think possible.I think everybody should read it. It can positively alter the way you think about life. Mitch Albom had always promised to keep in touch with his favorite college professor, Morris Schwartz, after college was over. Of course, he didn't. Some years later, he saw Morrie on TV, where Mitch found out that his favorite teacher had contracted the painful disease ALS. His body, was slowly withering away but not his spirit. Mitch gets in contact with Morrie and they start meeting on Tuesdays to talk about life, death and happiness. Mitch tries to gain Morries insight on numerous scope, not only for himself, but for his entire generation of thirty something. Morrie has a great attitude about life, and also death. He doesn't strive to gain posessions that he doesn't need. Instead, he focuses on people he loves and the relationships he has. Morries goal with Mitch was always to loosen him up, to make him cry before his life was over. He succeeds not only to get Mitch to cry by the end of the book. This is quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read. It is full of great mantras that I will always remember. My suggestion, keep kleenex handy, even if you are a tough guy.
