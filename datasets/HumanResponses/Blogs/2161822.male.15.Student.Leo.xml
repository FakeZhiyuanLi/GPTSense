      Well, tomorrow is the long awaited holiday of Halloween. What exactly does Halloween celebrate? Kids going around in cheaply made costumes of cartoon characters and monsters collecting candy from strangers who could have had that candy out on their filthy coffee tables for over 10 years? Sounds fine to me. Well, I'm still debating on whether or not I should wear a costume. Costumes some of my friends are wearing include wrapping themselves in 20 rolls of tape and dressing up as the others moms vagina. Yes, these are my friends. And now thinking about it, no I'm not going to dress up. I wonder what made me decide....

      I'm not a big fan of turning your clocks back an hour. Now days are seeming to take forever and now it gets dark at about 5:30. That's just great. I guess the days of going outside and enjoying yourself are over. Well, they've been over for a long time now but whatever. Well, only 2 more days with our Algebra teacher. I've always grown up thinking teachers were evil and crazy especially math teachers, but now I realize how true it was. Except our teacher skipped out on being evil and made up for it by being ridiculously crazy. I'll miss some of the good times in her class. "GO BRUCE!" If only we had a Bruce in our class.  "What's y-a-y?" I've never seen a worse speller in my life. I've never seen someone use the word "rigamaroo" so much. And she has proven that white people cannot dance. But hey, I think everyone will miss her crazy antics and the great times in her class. Except for maybe Jeeeimy MONtone. He never seems to have a good time in that class. Always sittin there with his hand over his face sniffin stuff. This kid hasta learn to lighten up. This kid likes his COCAINAAAAAAAAA. People with working minds please ignore the last 5 sentences.

      Tuesdays really suck. It might just be the worst day of the week for me. I mean, Mondays are bad too, but on Monday your too asleep to know what's going on. Tuesday really hits hard when you think to yourself that you have 3 more days not including today. Plus I have a double Chemistry period which should be considered capital punishment. I found something somewhat ammusing thought today. At last period, a certain kid who sits behind me (I won't mention names Dave) decided to pretend to write stuff on my back. Funny funny. Well turns out our teacher saw him and apparently didn't see the pen in his hand. This lead her to believe that he was just touching my back. He was told "just move away if you feel like touching him(me)  again." Interpret this story as you like.

      Well, as the year progresses, more and more people are getting their permits. Even some are getting their licsenses. And the luckiest of them are getting cars for their 16th birthday. How cute. Well, I'm the luckiest of all. I won't be getting my permit, yes permit, until the end of this year. Most people will have their licsenses by the time I get my permit. AND I probably will either get a really crappy car or not even one. *sigh*

      Well today I added a counter to this website. Maybe I shouldn't have because now I'll become depressed when I visit my site and I see the counter is still at 3. *sigh* At least 3 people visit my site. I love the link I got with the counter. "Flowers" I didn't put that there on my free will I'll have you people know. I would get rid of it but I got a scary threat from the site that provided me the counter that if I altered the link, they would call me names and put a big picture that I stole the counter. Like I have any intention on stealing a free counter.

      I really don't know what to write for this entry. Today was my Fantasy Basketball draft but of course I missed it. It seems me missing all of my fantasy drafts has been a tradition the past 2 years. Figures I get the guy who raped a woman. Anyway in football news, Giants are playing Vikings this week. Everyone is talking about the curses in the MLB, but honestly. There has to be some sort of curse on the Giants. "Outstanding run by Barber to bring the Giants to the 5 yard line. Here goes the snap....OH MY! Collins fumbles the ball and the defense recovers." How many times have we heard this. Or how many times have we watched the special teams ruin a game. Well, actually I don't think there's a curse. The Giants are just that bad. But then again, all of my sports teams seem to suck. Knicks, Bulldogs, Giants.. *sigh*

      The weekend has finally arrived after many a days waiting...well 4 days but. Let's see what there's to do on a Friday night in Hazleton. You can always go to the superb shopping center known as the Laurel Mall. But then again, going to the same mall for over 3 years every Friday night gets a tad bit boring. Right next to the mall is Hoyts Cinema, well Regal Entertainment or whatever it's been changed into. Movies never cease to be exciting but when you're forced to sit next to a 200lb man with a 7 ft tall man in front of you, it sort of ruins the experience. And watching people get stoned and smashed outside of the front entrance is only fun for about 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Let's see, you can always go to Bowl Arena to bowl a few games but it ruins everything when your high game is a 57. Best bet would be just to stay home and think about how everyone else in the entire world is having a blast this Friday night except for yourself. What a smashing time we have here in the lovely town of Hazleton "where all the birds go to die."

      Hey everyone. Welcome to my Blog. I'll be updating this hopefully daily, but if not whenever I get a chance. This is my chance to show how wonderful a life I have compared to you suckers. Just kidding. I'm just a regular joe. You know, the kid that nothing ever exciting happens to and the kid who just zones out every chance he can get. That's me. Only somewhat exciting thing....well somewhat.... is that I'm in a band. If you want more information (which I know all 2 people who look at my Blog want to), go  urlLink here . Another good site is my friend Neil's website,  urlLink KindergartenBabble . Good humor, good pictures, good food, and a good time altogether. Go to both of those site's if you are bored and even if you are not. Well I'm done with my entry for today since I just remembered I have a History test tomorrow. LATER.

      I feel bad for Thanksgiving. I mean, as soon as the holiday is over everyone forgets about it and sets their minds on Christmas. Thanksgiving is important too you know. It um.. uh.. well,.. we wouldn't celebrate it for nothing. After all, even when Christmas is done and over with, we're still in the "Christmas holiday" for at least a good 2 weeks. Man Thanksgiving really gets the short end of the stick. So, what else happened over the weekend. Friday night was ... interesting. I'll refrain from going into much detail to keep from insulting some people. Saturday morning was a waste. Eat, watch TV, sit here on computer...blah blah blah. Saturday night though, my family went shopping in Wilksbarre. Can't miss those holiday sales. "We came here to shop shop shop until the stores close." Well. This should be    hell. Shopping is pointless unless you walk into a store alredy knowing what you want. But enough complaining. Today is my little cousin's birthday. I don't know what to say about that. So I'll keep it to "Happy Birfday little cuz." Well, the Thanksgiving vacation is almost over. Ok I'm sorry to get off subject (well, there really hasn't been a subject for any of these blog posts) but anyone who follows the Knicks : What's up with McDyess? Wow this guy has been injured for way to long and yet he still gets paid. And what self confidence he has : "I know that people think, I'm going to be the savior, but I'm not," McDyess told the newspaper. My prediction is that he'll return from injury, play a quarter, re-injure his knee, and go back onto the injured reserved list for the rest of the season. *sigh* Come on Knicks.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Black Friday. What a nightmare. Shopping is bad enough, but throw in about 1000000 crazy families shopping for Christmas and the thin line between shopping and hell begins to fade. Why must people insist on shopping on one day. And Christmas isn't even for another month. If people were smart, then they would all think "Oh, it's Black Friday. I won't go shopping today." and soon no one will go shopping on Black Friday. Which would make it White Friday? Sounds too racist.. Anyway the Thanksgiving festivities went quite well yesterday. Considering I fell asleep, I thought it was a great day. I suggest everyone visits  urlLink Newgrounds.com . I enjoy this site. Maybe it's just me, but I've been spending alot of time watching the Flash videos and playing the retarded games there. While not staring at the black hole I call my computer screen, I've been contemplating my life. All of my life accomplishments and all the lessons I have learned. I've come to the conclusion: I have no life accomplishments worth getting a medal for and the lessons I have learned I have forgotten 5 minutes later. Which is sad considering everyone should accomplish something and get a medal. "The Pie Eating Medal" "The Best Sports Player Medal" "The Most Cynical Medal" Maybe I can campaign and run for "The I Don't Do Much Of Anything Medal."  Listen to H.I.M.

      Finally. The long awaited Thanksgiving vacation has arrived. Today was our "Gold and White Day." We competed in hallway decorations and lip sync. There were plenty of fun-filled events like "Orange Pass", "Scooter Relay", and "Clothing Relay." As you can tell by the descriptive titles, these events might have been the most fun I've had. Who am I kidding. Today sucked. The events were stupid. My class spent many days after school working on our hallway decorations and our lip sync. But nevertheless, we didn't win. Our hallway decoration was ok, but it still sucked. And our lip sync was plain terrible. So yeah. Gold and White day is for losers. The local band, Neötærik performed today. Very good. I enjoyed the performance alot. Nice job guys. So tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I'm really not too excited. What is there to get excited about? Stuffing my face with food is a routine for me so that's nothing special.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Wow. Today was the most retardedly funny day ever. We had our Spanish trip today which would have been a total waste if not for an extremely hot dancer. She was amazing. She made up for all the stupid actors and performance. Ole! or whatever. I enjoyed watching everyone on the bus act all cool with their cell phones. Let me whip out my cell phone and hold it and look all cool. Some people were actually betting money on bowling games. You know. Those virtual bowling games you can download onto cell phones. The great bets we come up with. After the outstanding performance of Don Quixote, we took a nice ride down to McDonalds. Thankfully, there was a Perkins restaraunt right by it. So we went over to find that the entire bus has followed us to Perkins. Great. So me, MONtone, Murphy, Kriesher, Evancho, and Wilson get a table. Thankfully we avoided having to sit by Dave. I felt bad for making Dominic have to listen to "Why do they hate me?", "Look at my cell phone.", "Mandy sent me a text message.", "Read it.", "Again." Anyway. We sit down at our table and I don't get a menu. So even Perkins hates me. Well, we all know what we want to order. But where's the service at Perkins. Good god. We were there waiting for about 15 minutes watching everyone else get waited on except us. About 5 waitresses walked by our table, looked at us, and walked away. What the Hades man? Well we finally get served and this waitress must of been super-rememberer or something. We ordered so fast and she didn't write anything down. I was impressed. Of course while waiting for food we found the stupidest things to talk about. Which doesn't surprise me. Well we finally get our food. I ordered this shrimp basket thing. It was good until I realized half the basket was filled with (what seemed to be and what tasted like) non-edible little pieces of crap. Yet Nick ate them all. Also, Joe ordered eggs and bacon and half his plate was filled with shredded hashbrowns and he got about 1/2 of an egg white. I think they should show you a picture of what you're ordering on the menu so you know not to order the 1/4 shrimp 3/4 non-edible red, white, and purple looking things. They color coded Justin's plate with his .... his.... taco. Steak quesidilla or whatever. I found it somewhat awkward today in Perkins. A strange busboy who was cleaning up kept staring at the girls in our class. He was trying to be shady hiding behind the corner but you could tell what he was doing. A regular Charlie. So one time he was standing behind us and he came over to Joe and said, "You guys have pretty girls." in the I'm retarded and pervert voice. Then walked away with a child molesting smirk on his face. Then he went to another table and started talking to them about our "pretty girls." Then he finally went to one of the girls' tables and talked to them. By this time I was ready to get the heck out of there. But he left all of us alone then. Then I looked over Evancho's shoulder and I see some old lady with huge buckteeth staring at me. Ok now I'm scared. Occasionally I glanced over to see if she was still staring and yep. There's her face watching me eat my red tasteless strings. Then I look to my left and the one really strange girl in my class is there staring at us also. Now come on. This is getting out of hand. I really just want to leave at this point. Then we're about to leave and I make a couple comments about these people staring at us and I look to my right. There's Jimmy about to spit all his soda out cause he's laughing too hard. I don't think I've never seen such a messed up day in my life. I've never laughed so hard in my life. Perkins. Never again.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Sometimes I wonder why I post in this blog since I know that know one views it. Oh well. Tomorrow my Spanish class is going on a "field trip" to somewhere in Scranton to see a play. Supposed to a recreation of the story of Don Quixote (I probably killed the spelling). Even though we get out of school all day, I think it will still be painful. I mean it's like a Spanish class that lasts 7 hours. Plus we have to wear our school uniforms, you know, those starchy, uncomfortable oxford shirts and sweaters. Plus after the show we get to enjoy a nice hearty, Spanish meal at McDonalds. I find it funny how most of our teachers cringed in the fact of taking a field trip for Spanish class. Chem teacher thought we were going to Wyoming street, Math teacher laughed, etc.. I think all I need to know how to say is "do you have anything to eat?" and "where is the bathroom?" I'm never going to go to Spain (well, highly unlikely) and I will probably move out of Hazleton as soon as possible, so where will Spanish be useful? Translators supposedly get the big bucks. I wouldn't become a translator if my life depended on it. Well, maybe I would. But I have trouble with the English language so I can imagine myself speaking in a different language to people of high importance about issues of high importance. Ok enough about Spanish I hear enough of it in school. I think I have found the   urlLink stupidest game online   If you are one of those people who enjoy excessivley stupid things, click the link.

      Nothing really exciting happened today. But nothing ever does so whatever. I realized just how stupid some people can be in Chemistry class. Some kid was going to take a shot of 12 molar hydrochloric acid. For those of you fortunate not to know what that is, let's just say he'd be dead very quickly. Today at lunch was another unsuccessful attempt at purging our table of Dave. If I hear one more thing about his cell phone or his stupid girl problems I swear I will flip out. I think he should 1. stop making excessively dumb comments. 2. destroy his cell phone. 3. get a girlfriend that lasts more than 24 hours so he will finally shut up about his problems. and 4. be normal for a change. Yes I know it sounds a little extreme but I think.... ah who am I kidding. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Today was interesting. Especially now that I know one of my friends is a killer. Most of you know the story, so I'll go on to my conclusions on what will become of our dear friend. 1. He will be rewarded a ridiculous amount of money for actually killing a huge drug lord. You never know. The man might have just been sleeping and then when Dinko through the rock through the window it could have frightened him to death. 2. The cops will find a rock, scan it for fingerprints, and take Dinko to prison. Why it would happen I have no idea, but it would be fun to see him being taking away in cuffs "I didn't do it I swear! I'll I did was vandalize the car!" 3. He will remain on the streets to kill and kill and kill and since he is so elusive he will never get caught. 4. Everyone will forget about this misfortunate event. I personally want to see number 2, but most likely everyone will forget about this in a day. Anyway, if the cops want location on this insane killer, take a stroll through White Haven. And send me my reward in cash. Anyway... I think I have way too much fun at lunchtime. The people I am fortunate to sit with sometimes make me wonder, do they know they are friends? Every other two minutes they are fighting about something. "You talk about your cell phone too much!" "What else is there to do?!" "Dave I hate you." "What did I do?!" "That was the stupidest comment ever" "WTF" Yes, and there is plenty more. Sometimes I wonder about people. Good news. I finally found the college I would like to dedicate 4 years of my life to: Our Lady of the Mother of The Blind. I enjoy math class too much. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Hey it's been awhile since I posted. Guess it was due to some frustrating times lately. Anyway, it's Sunday and the weekend is almost over. Such a shame. Over the weekend, my roof fell off. Well, no not really. Just some shingles came off. But still, that was some intense winds. On Friday when I was walking home I found out even though I was moving my legs, I wasn't making any progress. Plus I think I lost gallons of water out of my eyes. Fun fun. Hazleton is exciting. You never know what kind of weather you might get. One day it can be a blizzard with 10 ft of snow. Next day, bright and sunny. 90 degrees. Next day we get a hurricane. God I love Hazleton. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Today is the day I have been waiting for for about 2 years. I finally got a cable modem! No more 30 minute mp3 downloads for THIS KID. I am not slow anymore so BAM. At least when it comes to the internet. Anyway, today we had a half day. This week was cool since Tuesday we didn't have school. It's almost Thanksgiving break too. I always thought Theology class was an easy class. An easy 100. I mean last year we did work for the first 15 minutes of class then had the rest of the period to goof around. Plus, we had mostly open book tests and are exam was open-notebook-work-with-a-partner. This year it's more like work all period, hard tests, lots of notes...etc. Theology isn't supposed to be hard. Chemistry is ridiculous. I mean, it's hard enough even when I know what I'm doing and he teaches the material well. But it's even harder when he doesn't teach. His method of teaching lately has been to give us a problem on the new material and say "Here do this." I hate that man. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Alot of changes on my blog that no one reads. I removed the forum because I realized that it was pointless to have a forum on a weblog. And I added a free links link. Here will be all my links to various funny/stupid/cool websites I recommend for your viewing pleasure. You the reader can also post a cool link. But please. No obscene sites or bad links. That means you Eidleman. And if I get one Sixers link I will kill whoever posts it. *cough Ashley cough* I'm gonna keep this short since I will be adding more things to this webpage because I have nothing better to do.

      Well today I spent about an hour attemting to learn HTML. Didn't work out. Anyway, if you haven't noticed, I added a new counter, guestbook, and message forum thanks to the solution to all your web design needs: Bravenet. Sign the guestbook please, but I can't ask too much considering I doubt anyone reads this. Its' not a crime to dream though. In football news, if you haven't heard by now, THE GIANTS SUCK! I've been a Giants fan for years now and each year I think to myself "self, maybe this year New York will get their act together. Yeah, this will be a good year." Once again, I think I should stop dreaming since it'll never happen. In basketball news, I'm being positive. The Knicks will make it to the Championship and  WIN!  Although, Keith Van Horn needs to be a little more consistent. When he was on the Sixers, he sucked. Horribly. He had a couple good days but for the better part of the season he blew. Well, he came to New York (against my will) and first game he rips it up. I was amazed. Here was a skinny white boy who averaged about 4 pts in the playoffs last year, and now he's scoring 29 pts for the Knicks. But of course, this didn't last. Dreaming is for losers as I've concluded this past 5 minutes while writing this post. Well, I've also concluded that I suck at bowling. Pretty sad that last year my average was a 127 which sucked and now it dropped to an 88 which sucks even worse. Oh well, maybe if I tried. Naw, there's really no excuse. End post.

      I really enjoy hockey games. The fights are awesome, the foot-long hot dogs are awesome, and joining in with the entire arena chanting "ref you suck!" is awesome. Beside the fact that I have no clue what's going on when it comes to the rules, I like hockey. Anyway, the weekend is almost over and I just remembered I have a crapload of homework. U.S. history outline (which I won't do), read pages in a novel (which I won't do), study for religion quiz (which I won't do), and study for chem test (I have to study for chem since I suck in that class). So actually I don't have alot of homework after all. And since I have to go to Scranton to help my grandmother move, I guess I won't be studying after all. Heh I don't see how homework is all that bad. Christmas is coming very soon. I would of said Thanksgiving is coming soon, but who really cares about Thanksgiving. Beside eating alot, there isn't much to look forward to at Thanksgiving. At least at Christmas you get to eat alot and you get presents. I think I've found what I want for Christmas. I would show a picture but I'm horrible at HTML so I guess you won't be seeing it. Ha Ha it will remain my mystery until Christmas. Well, I don't think I'll be getting a car for Christmas so there goes that. I think I've been writing this entry for way too long so it will end now. End post. Listen to H.I.M.

      Weekend is almost over. Well half-way over. Nothing really is goin on today. Beside I'm going to a hockey game nothing really exciting is happening today. Unless your one of those kids who think church is fun. Yesterday night I was so bored I actually went out. Runaway Jury was actually a pretty good movie. HOWEVER, I almost died/puked/passed out at the cinema. The lady I sat next to was at least 300lbs and had the absolute worst body odor I have ever smelled. Absolutely horrible. Anyway, the movie was really good. Congradulation's to Neil and his website for making it Hazleton big! Click on the link on the right to view this outstanding website. Hmm, I need a different adjective. Funny? No.. Odd? No... Just go to KindergartenBabble and you think of one yourself.

      I really dislike teachers who rush through material which should normally take at least 2 weeks and then give a test with everyone not knowing what they are doing. I hate school. Anyway, it's finally the weekend and another exciting Friday night in Hazleton. This isn't a good post since I have no clue what to write about. Nothing really happened in school worth telling about. Except the whole dinosaur girl thing. Man that's great. Dinosaur and her caveman will take over Hafey someday. Someday...

      Today was my sophmore retreat. And let me tell you it was a blast. Not really, more like a waste of time. All we did was sit around in a big circle and talk about crap. Then every so often we would get in groups and do "fun stuff" like drawing on puzzle pieces or discussing why we are like the apostles. Then we all gathered to have mass before finally going home. We all concluded at the end of the day that our class has no unity and are a bunch of lazy morons who don't get involved. We're supposed to "change" but I think we all know how that will work. The drive back to Hafey was one of the most frightening experiences I have ever had. You see, our bus driver was looking at everything BUT the road. Scary looking up to see the bus driver having a nice conversation with the person in the front seat and occasionally taking his hands off the wheel to fix his hair/mustache/hat. Interesting and scary at the same time. End of post. Listen to H.I.M.

      Ok, a couple things I hafta get off my chest. First off, let me explain why I didn't get a chance to post an entry yesterday. Every Tuesday is double Chemistry period. Lab day. Now I don't mind labs. They're usually fun considering it's two less periods I have to listen to our teacher lecture. But this lab was excrutiatingly (I know I killed the spelling on that) annoying. Each experiment took at at least a half hour and it would be fine if we had that much time. But of course we don't.  It wasn't really the lab itself I was mad over. More the fact that I was at home the rest of the night typing up a lab report about crap he didn't teach. I was trying to figure out formulas and equations for over 5 hours plus typing and retyping things after I realize they are all wrong. It also might have helped if we actually did the experiment right, but oh well. Anway, today in chemistry, he finally taught the crap that I needed to do the lab. Of course after I spent hours trying to figure it out myself. If you can't tell, I dislike chemistry. Alot. Anyway, our new Algebra teacher is awesome. Much better than our crackhead teacher, although I will never forget some of the things she has said. Enough said for today. Listen to H.I.M.

      Well, it's a brand new fun filled week before us. Today was my first time this year at bowling club. I think it'd be a little better if I was actually good at bowling but oh well. We had the Walk For The Vikings today where you raise money to walk around our school. Hmm somethings wrong with this picture. We lose either way. We're paying money and we're wasting time and energy by walking around aimlessly for the lone reward of satisfaction. Ah, Hafey events are the greatest. Either way you end up contributing more money to the poor, cheap, doomed hell we dare to call school. After we finished our walk, me and a couple friends went to Yong Hao for some food before bowling club. And what else do we find but an abandoned car. What could we do with an abandoned car? Of course several rocks were thrown at the windows and many times were unsuccessful at breaking a window. You swear someone was watching us when a rock finally went through the window as we all scrambled and sprinted nonchalantly to the bowl arena. Halfway during bowling, two of the kids on my team were sick to their stomachs from the mass amounts of chinese food they ate a few hours ago. I don't think they even ate that much it was just that chinese food is so filling and seems to go through your system like a pound of baked beans. Anyway, they were able to control themselves for a little. Soon I walk into the bathroom to hear the cheerful sound that everyone dreams of hearing: that of someone gagging on chinese food and throwing it up. Yes, I knew it was bound to happen sooner or later. I was just amazed at the fact that he told me he was trying to aim when he was puking. He must of had very bad aim since the puke was all over the floor surrounding the toilet. As you can tell, I had a very fun filled Monday.

      Well I missed the last two posts, so I'm not doin too well. Well let's recap my weekend. Friday. Halloween. Well at least I didn't go trick or treating. Instead I was over a friends house practicing and watching his mom and a kid fight and curse at each other. Very funny none the less. Saturday. Boring day. Nothing really happened Saturday except I went to Church which really isn't too exciting anyway. So Saturday was pretty much a waste. I look forward to the weekends so much but then when I do have some free time to do things I never do. Um I would reword that last sentence but I'm too lazy. Sunday. Today I was home alone and just like Saturday did nothing at all. Watched football, ate, laid down, repeat. I really need to move out of this wasteland. Hazleton is nothing but a collection of rain, sewage, ugly cars, and white people acting black. I wonder if other cities are populated with as many wanna-be-thugs as here in Hazleton. I sure hope not. Well I think I'll end this post now.

      I changed the title of this weblog. Not like anyone cares but I was just stating the fact. Vacation is awesome. It's not going to fast or too slow. It's just right. Although I haven't done anything productive over vacation, I enjoy being bored at home rather than in school. Today I went browsing music stores in search of a bass. And since there's only two music stores around where I live, it was a pretty short journey. C&C Music seemed to have the bass that appealed to me. It was a sleek Ibanez SR3000E. But most of you people don't know what that means, so why do I include details like that? Anyway for a bass that was originally 1,300$, the guy is selling it for 390$ with a hard shell gig case. Pretty good deal even though it's used. That was pretty much all I saw. At Morottos all they had was expensive Washburns that were ugly and cheap Peaveys. Enough of my rambling about what I want. And I really like this song. The Blank Theory - Invisible. Thanks to Eidleman for sending me it. I was flipping through the channels the other day and I think I found a new sport to pick up. Trick shot billiards. It's amazing. The one guy did this shot where he jumped the ball over a cue shaft, hit the one ball in, had the cue ball come back and hit another one. Too bad I can't even play regular pool. There goes another sport doomed for me. One piece of advice before I leave: Trust as little people as possible. If there's one thing I hate it's people who you think you can trust say crap behind your back. Only trust those people who you know won't take the trust you give them and shove it down your throat. Amen.  Listen to H.I.M.

      It's over. Christmas is done. But at least we still have another good week of vacation. On Christmas day, my wish was granted and it started to snow. It was becoming so beautiful. But then in an hour it all melted so whatever. You're in Hazleton. Remember the snow is always blacker and dirtier here than _(insert place here)_. Yesterday I went to Allentown with my family to waste some Christmas money. I think there are as many thugs and gangters walking around the Allentown mall as there are gothics and punks in the Laurel Mall. It was nice and crowded too. Just the way I hate it. As if I don't hate shopping the way it is, yesterday I had to wait in lines 10 people deep just to buy a pack of gum. But hey. It's the holidays what can you expect, right? I love on TV how many stupid things they air. Like the National Scrabble Championship or the Chess Tournament or all those stupid infomercials for knives(sadly I watched every re-run of these). Who in their right mind would want to watch two 50 year old men take 15 minutes each to form a word out of the letters "s, d, a"? Not my idea of fun.  Listen to H.I.M.

      So here before us is the first day of freedom. And it feels great. Today to celebrate the occasion, we had a big party in the Spanish room. So, I woke up to go to Spanish class for 4 periods and eat brownies and drink iced tea. Yep, I didn't wanna go either. We did however get to watch the video of my U.S. History teacher when he was on Jeopardy. He owned the first round, but it all deteriorated after that. So beside that and stuffing my face with food, school was a waste. A third of our class was absen...skipping today. About 20 kids. Funny how 20 kids absen...skipping today is alot for Hafey, but for the high school, 20 kids absent is equal to 1 kid absent here. So that makes me feel very special because over the high school, I would mean jack. But our class isn't really the cream of the crop either. I can't wait to get to college. Escape from hell..er Hazleton finally and experience a better way of living. Compared to the life of a high school student at Hafey, it must be better. And if it isn't, then I will be very disappointed. Anyway, today after school I thought to myself "What a great way to celebrate the last day of school before Christmas vacation by going down to the court to play basketball and toss the pigskin." So me, Neil, and Matt go down to the court. It's usually just us since I live right by it and Neil lives close to me and Matt lives somewhat close to me. So basically, we live close to the court. Anyway, I get there, and the court is filled with puddles. And of course Neil doesn't bring the broom to sweep the water off. (Sadly we did try this, but in fact it worked. Sort of. It just kind of moved the water to a different section of the court.) So we start playing basketball and it doesn't go to well considering our skills that we never had aren't too polished. Let's see, how bout we toss the football around. Well, this worked better than basketball, and we actually played for more than 3 minutes. But "monkey in the middle" gets old after 20 minutes. If you know our court, (which you probably don't) there's a playground right by the court. And we usually go over there to fool around since we suck at basketball. Well I go to the swings and wow. What happened. There are 2 massive puddles underneath the swings.  MASSIVE . They were about a foot deep and covered with a thin sheet of ice. Of course I had to still swing on the swings. It worked well until I jumped off and landed in a huge puddle of freezing water. I'm already wet and cold, so why not step up to a dare. Somehow I end up standing in the middle of the ice cold puddle-lake for 3 minutes. The water was up past my ankles and I had shorts on too. So after the first 30 seconds I lost all feeling in my feet and my ankles turned a weird shade of bright red. Of course after I finally got out I couldn't feel anything. In fact, they hurt pretty badly. And they still are after 9 hours later. Yes I am a retard. After I finished being an idiot, we went back over the court to have a half court contest. Sadly, we're better at half court shots than normal free throws. Recap what I'm good at: not basketball, standing in ice cold water for x amount of time, and half court shots. Yep (points to self) this kid's a winner.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Alright! Only um..(counts on fingers 1..2..) 2 more days until Christmas! It's about time I say. Tomorrow is a half day at school. Great. I have to wake up early and go to school for a half day. We won't even be doing anything. We're going to have a party for the upstairs hall. What fun. Because I'd really rather be in school eating poorly made cookies and drinking soda than be at home sleeping. I enjoyed the day off. I did...nothing. But it was better than being in school and doing nothing. Actually I got some wrapping of gifts done. I wrapped, let's see, 3 presents and then ran out of paper. Hey it's better than nothing and even better than less than nothing. I also got all the holiday cards done. Sorry, but I don't like Greetings Workshop too much. All the slogans for the cards are, in my opinion, stupid. "Where does a snowman go to dance?" (Kid opens card).."A SNOWBALL!" GET IT? (Kid realizes how stupid card is and starts to cry) Yeah, come on Greetings Workshop, let's get our acts together. Anyway I was on my daily stroll through my house and I noticed how beautifully decorated the house was. With the stockings hanging over the fireplace and the lights hanging outside, and the decorated tree. Ah Christmas just gets me in that holiday mood. You know the mood where you get all stressed because you don't have any presents for anyone and where you're in a bad mood because your relatives are coming over and the turkey is dry so you don't eat it and go hungry and where there's mass confusion everywhere..(catches breath) Yeah that mood. But really, I like Christmas. Not because of the presents, but because of the family togetherness. Makes you all warm and tingly inside. Ok I'm done bs'ing for now. Shanamanamanamana tonighttt! You should go check out Homestarrunner.com and watch some of the Strong Bad emails. Some funny stuff that doesn't make sense. Just the way I like it. Another good site is Rathergood.com. Both links should be in the free links section. I would put it here for convienience but the HTML isn't working right now and I don't feel like trying to fix it so this is where I shall leave and go to bed.  Listen to H.I.M.

      So it's another Friday night and here I am at home. Again. Friday nights aren't really the awaited thing they were before. I remember a few years back when every week I would look forward to Friday night. I would get to go to the mall and hang out. Well, after 4 years of going to that horrible mall and seeing the same people for 4 years has done it's damage. And since there really isn't anything else to do in Hazleton on a Friday night except go to the mall or go to a movie. So here I am, at home, and content. Sad when I'd rather sit at home and do nothing. Oh well. This Friday was special. It was the last full day before Christmas vacation. Well it's about time. Eternal bliss will be granted to all the condemned children of Bishop Hafey. Well, 16 days of bliss but I'll take it. Anyway that's all for now. I'm going back to what I do best: Nothing.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Well I learned a few things yesterday.  1. I suck at bowling.  Horribly. Let's see, first game I got a 90 somethin, which sucks. I can't throw straight for the life of me. Next game I bowled a little over a hundred. And I still can't throw straight. Next game I lost to Neil. And that is really bad. Neil, ..to put it as blunt as possible, sucks. We never speak of that game again.. And the last game I bowled, I lost to a little girl and a little boy. They were at tops 8 years old. The girl looked like she was maybe 6. And i still lost by at least 20 pins. So, there goes my career as a pro bowler. *sigh*.  2. Not even Staples likes us.  So we figured since we suck at bowling, we could walk over to Staples for something to do. Well, my idea of sneaking in the fire escape didn't fall through, so we went around to the front entrance. And there we see that it's closed. And it's pretty cold out too.  3. Put your money in the pool table so no one else plays.  We must have waited an hour to play pool. Just one game. But no. Stupid Bowl Arena should put a half hour time limit on billiards.  4. I am an idiot.  So after we were tired of waiting to play pool, we said "Well what else is there to do?" "Let's walk over to Weis and buy cotton swabs and glue and make something" So we go to Weis. As we were walking around, I was getting a little hungry. So I grab butter scotch krimpits and coffee cakes for the trek back to the Bowl Arena. (Yes you needed to know exactly what I bought) So we didn't get the cotton swabs anyway. Well, we were going to check out and yesterday was my first time using those self served check out machines. This is where I proved how stupid I really am. I'm standing there trying to figure this machine out looking like an idiot. First I swipe the item over the little laser thing. Nothing. So I look on the screen. A button said "Input Item Code". So I press that, except I have no clue what the item number is. So I cancel that. Next I see a button that says "Help". Well at this point, I guess it's safe to say I need help. I push it thinking a little tutorial will appear on the screen. Instead I hear an eerie, way to excited woman's voice coming from the screen that says "Help is on the way!" I look up and this light is flashing. At this point I'm ready to just put the food back and just leave, but along comes this helpful worker who helps me. Instead of explaining what I did wrong, he just grabbed the food, swiped it through the laser thing, and my order was done. What I spent 5 minutes trying to do, he did in 5 seconds. He came back later to make sure I was gonna pay. I'm surprised he didn't take my money and put it in the machine for me. As you can tell, it's amazing how well I'm doing in school. It's even amazing I made it to tenth grade. And all that was for 2 dollars worth of food.  5. Even if you live only a half a mile away, get a ride if it's below 10 degrees.  Yes it was painful even standing there waiting for the ride.  6. Watch out for birds.  Neil's dad's car is a perfect example of the wrath of birds. I counted 15 places on the windows alone where birds crapped. And when I got out of the car, it looked like the hood was white. It seems the birds have very good aim. I can't even work a self serve machine at Weis but a bird with 1/4 my brain can aim and crap on a car. Well, I think if I tried I can crap on a car too, but I'll save that for another post... Anyway, I encourage everyone to go to my links page and visit KinderGartenBabble dot com. It is holding it's first annual awards. Vote for your favorite movie, favorite musical artist, and many more. Just click the link and then go to Vote Caster. Make your vote count.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Only a few more days to hold out until Christmas vacation. Ah yes. I'll enjoy those 16 days (I think it's 16) of freedom. In that time I will be sitting around watching TV or outside enjoying the snow that we don't really have. I mean we have snow, but not snow snow. I was going to go sledding with a certain Neil Ciotola, but we realized that there was no snow on the road. Plus there's an intersection at the bottom of the hill, so probably one of us would get hit by a car. But then again the sled would be handy if that would occur since we can put the injured body on the sled and simply push them to their house. Oh, but then again theres no snow on the ground so that might not work. Plus the one pushing will probably think its funny and tip the sled over. So scratch that idea. Plus I spelled Ciotola right. I should get a prize. So basically my plans boil down to me and once again a certain Neil Ciotola freezing the basketball court by my house. That would be interesting though. Basketball on ice. Beside falling down everytime and hurting yourself badly I'm sure it's a promising idea. Hey can it get any worse than some of our other ideas. It couldn't go worse than when I tried to dunk on a pogo stick. Or running up an ice covered slide and falling on my face. Or.... and the list goes on. I love that court. It was basically where I spent all of my summer. Playing basketball at that beautiful court. Well, if you can look past all the cracks in the court, the grass growing near the foul line, the excessive amount of trash laying around, and the netless playground hoops, then it's just like an NBA court. And the playground by it is even better. With the swings that sound like they will break everytime you get on them. Or the sandbox that lacks sand and instead is filled with, well, I don't know what it is. Or the picnic tables and benches tied down to trees. Ah the beauty of Hazleton. Brings me to tears sometimes. Or maybe that's all the pollution in the air irritating my eyes. Either way, who can't love this town. Rhetorical sarcastic question. NEÖTÆRIK's show will be scheduled for JANUARY 3RD. You guys better be there. It's gonna be awesome, and if you guys want something to do instead of sitting here, show up at Funnybones. I guarentee you'll be impressed.  Listen to H.I.M.

       It's beginning to look alot like Christmas.  (sung in corny voice)  Ah yes. The first real snowfall to be proud of. It was even good enough to get us an early dismissal. And it's still coming down. Possibly no school Monday? That would be good and bad. Long weekend, but also another day out of summer vacation. School is pointless to me. I don't remember any of the material after I take a test on it, so what's the point? Oh well. Is it wrong that everyday I find myself saying "I'm bored." at least 10 times. And I hear people tell that same phrase to me at least 10 times. Is life supposed to be this boring? Or is it just the sad people of Hazleton. I'm betting it's just us Hazletonians. Anyway I just got back in from playing football outside. Well, we really didn't play football. It was more of making a pathetic lump of snow and putting sticks in it and calling it a snowman, writing kindergarten.com in the snow, playing on snowcovered swings, going down ice covered slides, climbing trees (unsuccessfully), rolling trashcans, and out of everything, hurting myself. I don't even know if my hands are still there since I lost all feeling in them. Actually I lost feeling in most of my body. And I plan on doing it all tomorrow. But tomorrow I will remember to wear gloves and bring a shovel and/or broom to perhaps get rid of some of the snow. Sad how I play football better in a foot of snow and without feeling in my hands. Maybe tomorrow I will get a sled and ride down the hill by my house. Until I realize that I can't stop myself and continue to slide out of control right into the intersection. It's very hard to type when you can't feel what keys your hitting. I think I've been doing this post for at least a half hour now. So maybe I will do something smart for a change and stop writing in this blog for now, go wipe all the blood coming from my dry, cracked fingers, and dunk myself in hot water. So long.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Well this blog post is dedicated to a great man, Joseph Kriesher. I forgot to wish him a Happy Birthday, which I am heartfully sorry for, so here you go Joe. Happy Belated Birthday. Joe is great. Don't let his rough exterior mislead you however. Beneath this rugged persona is the mind of a genious. Only to name a few accomplishments, he is the reknowned creator of the nickname "Lifeguard", a successful asset to the Hafey football team as a lineman, and has some mystical future-telling powers (he actually predicted when the bell was going to ring on a Thursday). These are but a few of Joseph's great life accomplishments. And who will ever forget his peace pipe-making skill. Joe truly has changed the world. And he will forever go down in the "I Am A Life Changing Person and I Am  GREAT " hall o' fame. And this my friends, is my tribute to the genious, the comedian, the loving man Joseph Kriesher the III.

      There's nothing like going outside to shoot some hoops in this weather. Oh yeah. 38° and winds that can blow trees down. It got a little pathetic when I had to shoot the ball a foot away from the basket to have it go in. Now when I run cold water over my hands it feels like its scalding hot. Plus it's hard to type right now since my fingers are all numb and swolen. I guess I'm just plain stupid since I do this everyday. Well, goodbye Thanksgiving vacation. It was nice while it lasted. But now only a few weeks until (dun dun dun) Christmas vacation. I might be one of the few kids that doesn't like snow. Maybe if I could snowboard well or ski or play hockey. But noo. I can't do crap in the winter. It's basically me shoveling snow and proceeding to jump in the huge piles of snow only to have me shovel it again. 70° and sunny is fine for me. Oh yeah. Just like to let everyone know (though you probably know already) that the great band Neötærik will be performing at Funny Bones sometime before Christmas. It is planned that they will open for the band Astatic. Please everyone come support them. You WILL be impressed.  Listen to H.I.M.

      I'm sore. Very sore. I really need to get in shape. So yesterday was very interesting I must say. I was at the Y from after school until 7 which took it's toll on my body. The main reason we went was to play basketball, but the Y had to be retarded and kick us out after an hour. And even in that hour, we couldn't really play a game since there were already kids playing a full court game and of course they couldn't share the court. After playing basketball....er shooting hoops....er shooting hoops whenever there was room to, we went to play raquetball. Which really didn't go over well. So basically we just sat around. Which was sorta interesting. I've learned a few things that really annoy me: 1. calling me Jonathan. Just say Jon. It's much easier and sounds better. 2. being followed around wherever I go. 3. being bugged by people to climb a rock wall when clearly I stated I didn't want to about 30 times. 4. running on a treadmill without stretching or warming up. 5. being poked. So there you have it. If you do any of these, run. So after our little trip to the YMCA, I went bowling at (ugh) Valley Lanes. Those lanes are horrible. Either your ball hooks too much, doesn't hook at all, or you put hook on it but it goes straight at the last moment. But I beat you AshLEY, remember that. So now after a fun filled day, I'm here recovering from it. I could barely get out of bed let alone move. My legs burn, my arms burn, my whole body is pretty sore. By the way, I should get a prize for having the most boring blog ever. Perhaps someone would buy me...   But I guess that would be wishful thinking. I really want tickets to go see the Knicks play the Sixers in March, so there's another idea for all you people who are looking for gift ideas for me. What occasion is it? Absolutely nothing. But it would be nice to either receive a guitar or NBA tickets on any random day. By the way, the bass in Around the World is crazy. I suggest all of you out there to be enlightened and start listening to good music. Blam that rap and r&b crap. Listen to stuff like H.I.M, System of a Down, Thrice, Misfits, etc.. Ok I'm out for now. Later.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Yesterday - school cancelled. Today - 2 hour delay. How can it get any better? Well, for starters, the school can shut down due to burst pipe caused by an open window. But I don't think it will happen. ...Again. I really have nothing to write about today. Yesterday was pretty cool. No school. Didn't do anything except go bowling. Which I owned a certain someone in. Yeah you know it. This blog is gonna be a filler since there's nothing to write about. Everday I find myself playing tetris more often. Why tetris? Only because it's the greatest game in the world. I mean come on, who doesn't like to sit down and watch a bunch of colored blocks fall down in strategic patterns? Exactly my point. I hafta say, I'm impressed with Hafey's heating system. Ok. I go to homeroom, not too bad. Not too hot nor too cold. Then I go to the cafeteria and it's like 90° in there. Then I go to the Spanish room where it's -30­­°. You gotta love it. Hmm. What am I doing now? Sitting here listening to music (Stone Sour) and writing in this.   Listen to H.I.M.

      So we're supposed to get alot of snow and crap tonight. Doesn't surprise me, since we do live in Hazleton, home of the bi-polar weather. It wouldn't surprise me either if we didn't get anything and it ends up being 90° out. Meteorologists aren't gods. Plus they're wrong half the time anyway. We better go to the Y tomorrow. If we don't then you're lucky until we go next time. Which will probably be soon anyway, so whatever. You won't win femme fatale. Anyway today I was hoping for no school, but a delay was cool. Some things just never get old. WATERRRR WATERRRR. If you don't get it, ignore that. But wow that was great. Guess you had to have been there which most of you weren't so 99% of you disregard that. I should think before I write crap down. And no, unlike most of you folks think, I do not spend hours proof reading and editing my entries. It's all spur of the moment. Yet it still takes me a half hour to write this crap no one reads. I've been doing this blog action for awhile now. Maybe 2 months? I have no clue, but I think I've been doing it way too long. My thought process is this. I register to get a blog. I write in my blog. I see the counter rise slowly, so I assume people are viewing it. I realize no one is. I continue to write just for the sake of wasting time. It's really a sad pattern but what are you gonna do. There really isn't anything else to do in this weather. I don't like skiing or snowboarding. But i hafta push  you  off the ski lift one time.. I can't play basketball outside. Well I can, but I'd prefer not to die of hypothermia just yet. Plus today walking home, I had a sweater and jacket on and everything, yet I was still freezing cold. Stupid wind. I really can't wait until summer. No school, plus I can go outside without worrying about dying. All I know is, we better play basketball a whole lot when summer comes. I'm not waiting another (counts on fingers for a minute...) 5 months for nothing. Ok I'm gonna stop writing now. Wish I was too dead to care, if indeed I cared at all..

      No school today. Nice. Another thing that's nice is that we don't get exams. Unlike the losers at the High School. Actually I'm the bigger loser for going to Hafey, but oh well. You know what I hate. Memorizing things. And having to recite it. I'm really not good at it, but that's life. So I'm thinking Wednsday is gonna be interesting. The whole situation isn't fair at all, and I need to think of something to get back at you with. Too much that you know about me...you don't win though. We'll see. I guess you're in my blog now. I hope you feel special.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Come on baby, don't fear the reaper...Hello everybody. What's up? Why did I ask that since I know no one can answer that? Why do I even right in this blog since I know no one reads it? DOES anyone read it? How will I ever know? Socratic method of teaching sucks. So let's see what did I do yesterday. Well since no one was going out, I stayed home. And even if they did go out, the mall sucks. So yeah I sat at home doing nothing. What fun. I think the greatest website has to be Newgrounds.com. Visit www.newgrounds.com now and enjoy.

      Hello readers of this blog. Let's see what I did today. Well I woke up at the incredible time of 6:43 and ate a fantastic breakfast of raw steak and mushy scrambled eggs. After downing this beautiful dish, my nourished body took itself upstairs and got dressed. In what you say? My wonderful uniform. What uniform you say? My crime fighting uniform! Yes yes. I do put time aside from my normal everyday life to help rid the society of those who plan to destroy it. So anyway, after getting dressed in the proper attire I take a deep breath and step outside into the freezing cold. Of course shorts, a t shirt, and a haggard plaid shirt aren't really sufficient in keeping me warm, so I returned to my modern day Bat Cave and got a nice warm cardigan. Now I was ready for anything. So now I hop into my BMW that I don't have and drive off into the night. Well...day. But whatever. After a thrilling drive through the slums, it was time for me to eat. Normally people simply walk into a restaraunt or go home and cook some medicore tasting sludge. But not me. Instead I climbed a tree and awaited for the feast to arrive. With my trusty laser pointer I managed to blind a squirrel which gave me enough time to jump out of the tree and beat the squirrel with a stick. Ah nothing like fresh squirrel patties to stir up your appetite. But now it was time to return home to relax after a hard day of crimefighting. Sure, driving in a BMW and hunting squirrels seems like crimefighting to me. So now after recalling my accomplishments today I will rest for 40 days and 40 nights. But yeah in all actuality this never happened you crazy kids. Today was just like every other day. Wake up, eat, work, eat, work, come home, sleep. You should know this by now.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Just one look into your eyes  One look and I'm crying  'Cause you're so beautiful   Just one kiss and I'm alive  One kiss and I'm ready to die  'Cause you're so beautiful   Just one touch and I'm on fire  One touch and I'm crying  'Cause you're so beautiful   Just one smile and I'm wild  One smile and I'm ready to die  'Cause you're so beautiful   Oh and you're so beautiful  My darling   -H.I.M. - Beautiful  Ok I'm putting more to this post since SOMEONE can't just read the lyrics like everyone else. Because I'm a machine who writes and writes about my boring life that no one reads about anyway. But yes this is all I'm writing since now this person is allergic to me.

      I find it harder and harder to come up with things to put in my blog entries since everyday I don't seem to do much of anything. I basically sit here or in my room with nothing to do. So goes life. I can basicaly sum up my day in one word: nothing. Well yesterday I decided to go out to the mall for the first time in about 2 months. Why haven't I been going you ask? Because the mall is pointless, boring, small, and well boring. After going to the same mall since 6th grade every Friday night, you sort of lose interest in walking into the same stores you always do. It is amusing though watching the fake bacon act all tough. How on earth are one of those rent-a-cops supposed to chase someone if the time arose? I mean they barely fit in their already XXL size uniform, are seen eating pretzels/pizza/anything they can get their hands on, and pretending to talk on their Fisher Price walkie talkies. That must be the worst job ever. Anyway, after we were through walking around the mall, we proceeded to go outside and make the long trecherous journey to Gallery of Sound. By masterfully dodging runaway cars, avoiding deep pits of snow, and the amazing feat of not freezing, we were able to successfully make it without too many fatal injuries. Pit stop at K-B first though. Of course we spent about 45 minutes (well not me. I sort of just stood and watched) playing the demo games on the Playstation they have set up. It is quite amusing though watching Joe play Jason in NBA Street Vol 2. Aside from the fact that Jason doesn't know what he's doing, it's fun to watch. On to Gallery of Sound. Nothing exciting at Gallery. Aside from a poster showing a man with the caption "Sorry ladies...I'm gay!", it was pretty boring. I like looking through the used cds in the front of the store. Maybe I'm just a loser (which is probably the universal truth) but I enjoy browsing through cds of various artists who a.)were a one hit wonder, b.)were big stars in the 90s, or c.)who just plain suck (i.e. Chumbawumba). So after Gallery of Sound, we said our prayers and set foot outside once again in hopes of reaching the Ground Round without losing any of our group. When we reached the eating establishment, we were forced to watch a golf tournament. Nothing wrong with a golf tourney, but this one seemed to be strictly focused on that Michelle Wie. The 14 year old-looks like shes 21-golfer who supposedly is better than some of the PGA's top guys. Every time I looked up at the TV, there she was. You swear it was HER tournament. Maybe it was...Oh well. I can care less about golf. So after a "fun filled" night, I can safely conclude that 1. the mall is boring, 2. wear more than a t shirt and a coat when its below 0, and 3. Razorblade Romance rules. Hmm long post today. Funny I started this complaining about how I never have anything to write. I should have said anything GOOD to write. It would have proved it's point with this post. I wonder if anyone really reads this. Oh well. It's nice to just type and type and type until I get carpal tunnel syndrome. But hey, who said life was easy? Ok enough for today. Peace out homies.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Well what do you know. We have off school today. Amazing isn't it? 3 day weekends rule. Except for the fact that there really isn't much to do unless you want to go outside and freeze your arms off. Well according to weather.com, it is 5° out but feels like -13°. That's just great. I can imagine if we had school today all the kids that have to wait for a bus. Half would be frozen to the ground and the other half would have pneumonia. (I killed the spelling on that) But now I find myself asking why am I up at 10 on a Friday when we have no school? Oh well. Chicken boullions are disgusting by the way. Who would take one and eat it plain? That's just wrong. Why do all these blog posts take me 30 minutes to write? Maybe because I start writing, lose my concentration, go watch TV, go play the guitar, come back, write another sentence, repeat whole process.. I should become a writer. It would only take me the next five years to complete one chapter, but hey. Everyone likes a challenge.  Listen to H.I.M.

      I realized what a boring person I am. I wake up, go to school, come home, sit at the computer, play guitar, and when I can play basketball. Same things everyday. But then again I live in Hazleton where you have to make your own entertainment with various things you find around town. (i.e. chained town picnic tables, abandoned cars with dead people in them, various boxes lying in the middle of the street,..etc.) It's such a shame it's so cold out. Maybe if I could snowboard or ski it might be a little better but since my skills are limited to talking and running around like a moron it leaves me little to do when the weather is this bad. I really hope we get a delay or something this week. School drags out so long. Today's history class was interesting though. We had a guest speaker from the Army tell us stories about life in the army. Very exciting. After hearing her I don't think I ever want to go into any armed services. So here I am sitting here listening to music and I don't know what else to write about. Like I said my life is pretty much the same things just repeated in different order. Music can either calm me down or make me so annoyed that I rip the radio off the table and toss it out the window. This music that causes the rage in me to escape is R&B. If you're not bored by the same beat over and over and over again you'll be annoyed hearing some "thug" talk about his woman. To name a few, I extremely hate Usher, those B2K morons and every other R&B artist alive. Anyway...After great strategery, the Knicks have acquired Stephon Marbury, Penny Hardaway, and some tall dude. Although Marbury got off to a slow start, he's returning to his usual 20+ point and 10+ assists games. The Knicks are on their way to a good future. Thank you Zeke. I wish that Hafey wasn't so stupid. In the Chemistry lab for example, for labs we have to mass some things. Well we only have maybe two balance beams that actually are calibrated right. The rest don't work and give you wrong results and Hafey is too poor to buy new ones. And you just have to love Hafey's heating system. But it's life.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Ah Mondays suck. But not worse than Tuesdays. Ah who am I fooling, everyday is the same: boring, dumb, boring,.... I love the weather here in lovely Hazleton. One week it can be in the 70s and the next week it's snowing, the roads are covered with ice, and the thermometers max at 10°. Last couple days have been terrible. You would walk outside for 2 seconds to get the mail can come back in with no feeling in your hands/arms/legs. It's perfect weather to go outside and play basketball in. But then again at least I would have an excuse why I can't make any shots. I could always just blame it on my bleeding hands which turned purple. They would never know.. I really miss the summertime. All those great days at the basketball court. Walking around like an idiot. Wasting way too much time at Valley High Ice Cream. *sigh* But look on the bright side. Now I can enjoy all of those things PLUS a side of frostbite. Awesome. So the weekend was ok. The football games were all very good. I was hoping that the Packers would beat the Eagles though. I hate the Eagles with a passion. I have to give props to field goal kickers though. Man I'd crap my pants if I was Akers. But I have to say, I would like to be the Colt's punter. That'd be the easiest job on earth.  When angels cry blood on flowers of evil in bloom. Listen to H.I.M.

      Thursdays aren't cool. It's close to the end of the week, and they feel like Fridays, but they're actually Thursdays. They deceive us...So the first week back from Christmas vacation was...well...terrible. What a shock. I sort of enjoed not having to hear Spanish at 11 in the morning. We come back to school and get swamped with tests. Not cool. I miss summer vacation alot. Or any vacation for that matter. But I think I might have found a way to make the days go by faster and put a little fun in the weeks. Making a movie. Random penguins. Abused clowns. Robert and Evert would give it 7 stars. Anybody with a penguin costume, please contact me immediately. Until then, this is where I leave. Rock on.  Listen to H.I.M.

      *sigh*. Back to school already. It was nice while it lasted. Yesterday was cool. I went to see the Neötærik show at Funnybones. For those of you who didn't show up, you missed a good show. Beside the fact that it was dark and I couldn't see the person 5 feet to my right and the fact that I was afraid for my life to step in the center of the floor, I loved it. The song listing was great and they were all performed just like the actual song. It was great. Plus the originals were awesome. The two songs I was impressed with most though were the last two. System Of A down - Toxicity, and Metro. Wow. You should have come just to see those two songs. But the whole thing was great. Next time you guys should come. You'll have a good time.

      Well I just got home from a long day at King's College presenting a stupid PJAS project. I got 2nd. Who cares. The judges were retarded. At least it's done with. So anything new? Naw. What did you think something exciting actually happened? Didn't think so. Wow PJAS was a huge waste of time. Well at least I'm not doing it next year. Screw perseverance. Oh yeah. I need people that can play instruments. Specifically a bass player and drummer. Just to jam with. (That means you Ryan). Contact me immediately if you do.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Well, tomorrow is Friday. Which means two things. First, it's the Battle of the Bands. If you want to go, but don't know where the Newton Recreational Center is, have no fear! Check  urlLink Neötærik's site  for directions. Secondly, tomorrow signifies one day until PJAS. Which isn't a good thing. Since I was lazy and put off my project until today. I just learned my speech today, which I will forget by the end of the day, and I have to present tomorrow in front of classes. Great. Just great. Sunday will be great. But now, it's just horrible. This week sucked. I was workin on stuff all week and memorizing and attempting to understand equations. I need to relax man. Chill outtt. But anyway, what happened today worth mentioning. Nothing really. School was boring like usual. History was especially long. Somehow I managed to fall asleep 3 times in 3 different positions during that period. And it's Lent. How about that. I wonder who will break their Lenten "promise" first. Why do these blogs take me so long to write. I've been sitting here, drinking gatorade, spinning in my spinny chair, and listening to music for about 20 minutes thinking of what to write. Maybe if I was writing something people read, but it's just my blog. And my blog = waste of time. But at least it keeps me occupied.   Mr Peanut Bowl (7:31:03 PM): i was experimenting so i wrapped each of my fingers in different tape and the finger with electrical tape turned blue immediately  I'm glad our friend Neil is contributing his share to the world of science. And common sense. So another lesson from Neil, don't wrap tape around your fingers or anything else for that matter for you might by some crazy chance cut off circulation.

      Wow after today, I've learned a few valuable lessons in life. 1.  Don't wear shorts when you plan on going outside to play football in the snow/ice.  I was actually fine until we started playing. And falling in the snow. And killing my legs on ice. My left leg looks like a dog chewed on it. From my ankle to my waist is all scratched up, bloody, and just messed up. But that's what I get for wearing shorts. 2.  Don't give up if you suck at something in the beginning.  Man, when I was just throwing the ball with Neil, I couldn't catch or throw. I mean, I wasn't even that far from him and I couldn't reach. When we started playing though, I got better as the day went on. So listen up kids. Even if you think you suck at something, don't give up because you might actually be good at it. Not saying that I'm good at football, but I can at least catch. Most times. 3.  Don't throw big industrial car batteries without considering consequences. Or without wearing goggles.  Ah yes. One of the better lessons I have learned today. Never try to throw a large battery filled with acid over a fence. You might just go blind from the exploding battery shooting acid in the air, as a certain Neil Ciotola demonstrated for us. Proof of the destructive effects of battery acid is his contact lense, which is deformed now. 4.  Don't bring a football into Boyers Supermarket unless you want to be accused of shoplifting.  All of these things seem to relate to Neil, but anyhow. I never knew a football could be mistaken as a drink. But I guess you have to be keen about what people are sneaking out of your store if you want to work at Boyers. So yeah, don't bring footballs into stores. Because you know it could be mistaken as one of those football-shaped bottles. 5.  Wear a belt unless you enjoy doing bellyflops onto solid ice.  Once again this relates to Neil. So the basic lesson in this ...um...lesson is to wear a belt. He proved that one cannot hold his pants up AND fall on his hands to soften the blow. Of course he chose to hold his pants up because I guess he'd rather keep his pants on than castrate himself. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing for me.   So there you have it. 5 lessons that will change the way I live. I suggest you all read these and take the advice given. Because I don't think anyone wants to have a leg amputated, get falsely arrested for shoplifting, be blinded by battery acid, or get castrated. If you think the above are good ideas, stop reading this and kill yourself. Well, don't kill yourself. I don't want to be responsible for anything. But at least hit yourself.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Argg. No I'm not a pirate. I'm just mad that we got snow again. Come on weather, I want sun, dryness, and all that fun stuff. But nooo. I guess I'll have to wait some more. So this week is going to be hectic since I procrastinated working on PJAS until now. Such a shame I have to do it. Oh well. John Petrucci rules. So anyway. I really need ideas for sections on my website. If you haven't checked it out, go  urlLink here . Or maybe just save yourself alot of time and don't go to the site since it sucks anyway. But hey I tried. I've been keeping myself busy in these cold winter days by playing guitar and writing tabs. So if anyone wants a song tabbed out for guitar or bass, let me know. E-mail me or IM me. (jonp3313 or VaLo138) Just don't request a song like any by Dream Theatre or Black Sabbath. I'm not all that good, so leave the solos to a 20 second minimum. Wow I wish I could play a Petrucci solo. That would be awesome. But for now I'll keep practicing. Maybe I'll get good in 10 years. Naw.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Hey everyone. It's Friday thank God. We'll be having full weeks now until Easter. Wow that sucks bad. I hope we dont get anymore snow days either. I'm sick of winter. Very sick of it. Maybe if it snowed heavily and we got out of school. But no. It's just cold, no snow, but tons of dirty ice. I have to say the past couple of days have been warmer. Funny how I think that 40° is hot. That's what I get for living in Hazleton. As of now, Chevelle is the next coolest band to H.I.M. I don't know why I haven't been listening to them as much as I am now. They are great. Go buy their albums and their dvd. Great stuff. I say that God gets rid of winter. Forever. Winter is dumb. Summer = cool. At least let all the snow melt so I can go outside and do something other than slip and play football on ice. But I'll keep doing that for another (hopefully) month.  Listen to H.I.M. and Chevelle

      It's hard to think of things to write lately. Funny how I can't think of words to write down, although I can't stop my thoughts from racing. It's a weird feeling. You just don't know what to say. Fear of what would happen if the words do escape your mouth. And the ironic security of keeping those forbidden words stuck in your teeth. This past 2 weeks have been like this. Nothing I can do about it. But I do have my music. See, everyone should learn how to play an instrument. When everything else sucks, you can turn the power on and let go of everything. I can't keep this blog totally negative. So on better news, I'd like to tell everyone to get the Chevelle DVD. I know it's a little late to be saying this, but it is awesome. So basically all I've been doing is putting the DVD on, blasting it through my stereo and playing along. Makes it feel like I'm still in a band. Anyone that can play an instrument decently, contact me. Immediately. That means you Ryan as soon as you get good. You too Eidleman.

So until then I'll be bored. Which is everyday. We really should have tomorrow off. I really can't think of anything to say. I can't even think of crap to use as filler.

      Oh my god do I love warm weather. Today was the first day in way too long when I actually worked up a sweat playing basketball. It was great. Even though I was dead tired after playing, it felt so good to be outside again. And from what I hear, it's supposed to be nice this weekend too. Ah I love it. But something I  don't  love is research papers. Yep it's that time of year again when we must busy ourselves researching, reading, working, puking, and worrying about stupid research papers. Somehow my topic went from "The electric guitar's effect on rock music" to "Jazz and how Blues became a seperate music entity". Yep I don't know either. Either way it's going to be a pain to look stuff up. But GOD I LOVE WARM WEATHER. YEAH. Ok sorry. SO an update on my NCAA bracket: my bracket = destroyed. Pitt lost. Cuse lost. *sigh* Oh well. Now I'm rooting for UAB to win it all. That would be amazing. But oh well. Gatorade = too good = me drinking way too much of it = upset stomach. Hmm I want to play some more basketball. Too bad it's 10 o clock. Yep thank god winter is gone. Maybe this year I'll actually get a little better. .....(thinks about rediculous statement just made)..... hah naw.

      Well, this past weekend really was a killer. Especially on my bracket. Good God did this weekend destroy my bracket. I'm pretty sure I have about the entire right side mostly wrong and the left is not any better. Thanks to ridiculous upsets. This year is amazing. Kentucky loses to UAB. Most people don't even know who the heck UAB is. I figured to myself "hey this UAB team has no chance" and I had them losing first round. Well it just so happens that they decide to make it past the first round AND beat Kentucky. What the heck. Well anyway, I almost wet my pants watching the Georgia Tech -vs- Boston College game. I have GA Tech winning it all, so if they lost I would have been totally screwed. (Not that I'm not already screwed the way it is). Gonzaga loses to Nevada. Great there's another pick down the drain. Cincinnati loses to Illinois. By now I realize I have no chance in having a somewhat decent bracket. To make matters worse, UNC loses, Mississippi State loses, Stanford loses, Maryland loses, and NC State loses. Basically all I have left is my final four (Duke, Pitt, UConn, GA Tech). Ah March Madness is messed up this year. But hey at least it's something to watch on TV. The other day I found myself watching the national curling championships. How exciting that sport is. I also stumbled upon the channel displaying the national table tennis championship. Those dudes are crazy. They hit the ball like 100 mph and put weird spin on it. My table tennis games are limited to little taps back and forth at about 2 mph with every other hit going off the table. Yet another sport doomed for me from the start. I'm glad to see that this weekend will be nice out. I hope. But then again we are in Hazleton. Can't expect anything here. Today I walk outside and it's sunny and looks like it should be at least 50. Well, it ended up being like 22Â°. Gotta love the weather here in Hazleton. Yesterday I also found myself trying to come up with things to do on a Sunday afternoon. All me and Neil came up with was to visit the Hazleton museum on Wyoming street or visit Wal Mart. And since the museum is never open and going to Wal Mart is just plain boring, I ended up staying home yet again. Fun times.  urlLink Click here if you want to see something amusing yet pretty pathetic   Listen to H.I.M.

      Why does it have to snow? Anyway, today was ok I guess since we had a nice cool 2 hour delay. Gotta love shortened periods. On an even better note, let March Madness begin! Can't wait. So basically for the next couple weeks I'll be glued to the television watching basketball game after basketball game. But that's what I love about basketball. So I got this recording software for my computer. With some fancy mixing and cheap skills I'm able to record myself and make me sound somewhat good at guitar. I also think it's necessary to give props to a certain Ashley Sabol for burning me a very good CD. But she's too good for us now and left for New York for 5 days. Pfft. Hmm nothing else really happend since the freaking snow is preventing me from doing much of anything. My sledding experiences haven't been too successful. It was basically me and Neil jumping on an innertube and sliding forward for about 3 seconds then coming to a dead stop. Yeah Hazleton doesn't have too many good hills. Plus now all the snow is crappy slush and black ice. So snow football would be  ice  football. Which hurts pretty badly. (Refer yourself to previous posts to understand what I mean) I say the snow should melt and be no more. Well I've been saying this the past few days.  Listen to H.I.M. and Trapt

      *Yawn* We better not get snow tomorrow. There's always two sides to this issue. One part of my brain tells me to hope for snow so that we would have a half day or maybe even the day off. The other part of my brain is saying to pray for no snow so that we have a nice long summer and that I will be able to play basketball. In this instance instant gratification is defeated by long term joy. I'm really sick of the bad weather and recently I've been outside alot. Funny how living in Hazleton alters your view of warm weather. After all of those days when the temperature was from 0 - 10 °, 30 and up seems fine to me. I can go outside in shorts and be fine. But one good thing in March: March Madness! Ah yes. It's that time of year when we all go crazy filling out those famous brackets and waste all of our money on useless pools. And we love every second of it. As for my picks, I have Georgia Tech winning the championship beating UConn. Should be a good tourney this year. Except for the fact that the Atlanta division is stacked. As long as Duke doesn't win I'll be a happy camper. And now since it is pretty late I shall kill this post and send it back to it's rightful place: Hell.  Listen to H.I.M.

      You know what? I'm sorry about my constant complaining, but I really can't stand my chemistry class anymore. It really is pointless when the teacher needs to ask the kids if he's doing a problem correctly. For example, today we spent the entire class doing 2 problems. They're pretty difficult, but with some thinking you could figure them out. Well our teacher is doing the problem on the board and completely messing it up. Everyone sort of just looks at him and pretends like he's doing it right until someone tells him he f'd it up. Then he replies, "What?! How? What do you mean? How do I do it?" I don't know why he's even there since I can learn the same things by reading the book. (Which is what I end up doing anyway) And when he does take the time to explain a problem, he does it wrong and ends up confusing us more. So after a grueling, annoying period today, I'm walking out and as I walk out I overhear him say "(looking at the book)What is this? I don't know how to do these." Other than that, the day was somewhat tolerable. I was surprised to leave the building and find it to be warm outside. So I took advantage and played basketball. Until my stupid orthodontist appointment where I find out that I think I need braces. Great. Just great. So that sorta killed the rest of the day until I got to driver's theory which  always  brightens a day. (sarcasm) We did however get to watch some cool videos (sarcasm) like a funny one about airbags. I'm not sure when the topic of airbags became comical, but whatever. And after driver's theory I am here. And now after a long post for today I will be merciful and end it here.  Listen to H.I.M.

      I absolutely love no homework. Not that I do anything productive in my free time anyway, but it's cool. And you know what I love? Getting disconnected from AIM by an "unknown" error every half hour. I hate AOL. You also gotta love kids who invite themselves into something they're not wanted in and then complain when they are told about it. And I should grow up. Give me a break. But whatever. I'm done for today. 'Cause I had nothing really to say, but then again I have nothing good to say anyday. Whatever. Keep on reading my boring crap kids! And remember...

      Woo hoo no lab report! The experiment was pretty pathetic. We sat there mixing different solutions in order to combine them and observe a color change. Too bad the color didn't change. I think it's because all of the clear solutions were water. Once again, our chemistry teacher blesses us with his godlike knowledge. And of course it had to snow. I thought we might be done with bad weather and I'd finally be able to go outside for a change, but no. Mother nature screws me over again. At least there was no driver's theory tonight. That's the most boring waste of time ever. We learn about the different shapes of traffic signs and watch oscar winning movies. (Just take the one,  Please God, I'm only 17!  for example. Now come on. The title of this one has greatness all over it) I really hope it gets nice out soon. Going outside at least keeps me occupied. And keeps me from playing  games like this.  This one has to top the list for stupidest games ever. Check it out and I think you'll agree.  Listen to H.I.M.

      One word of advice: Never drink watermelon Gatorade. Man that stuff sucks. Another thing that sucks is double chemistry periods. Which I unfortunately have tomorrow. And one more thing that sucks: 15 page research papers. I really hope our research papers don't have to be 15 pages (single spaced too). Because that would ruin life as a whole. So on to my real entry. I really don't have one. Like most days. Our chemistry teacher once again made an idiot out of himself. He really can't read or spell. (equilibium) I can't wait until I don't have him as a teacher. Maybe at least if he remotely knew what he was talking about... And now instead of me rambling on about crap no one wants to read, indulge yourself in a game.  Cow tipping.   Listen to H.I.M.

      Wow today was boring. It was basically me coming on here for 10 minutes, going outside, coming back in for 10 minutes, going outside, ....etc. No one was even here to talk to. Not that I talk to alot of people though. Actually only a few. But today was still boring as hell. Tomorrow I have gym again so let's hope I don't get injured. Maybe we'll play Cageball. That is one of the most pointless games I've ever participated in, yet it's still some fun. It's basically two teams trying to push an enormous ball to the opposite side of the gym. Fun part is, there really isn't any rules on what you're allowed to do. So last time we played, we had two of the larger kids pushing it, other kids hitting it, and people jumping at it. Then you had Wilson pulling kids off of the ball and tackling them. So you never know what you'll get playing Cageball. Funny I get hurt playing basketball and not Cageball.

      Well today wasn't too bad. Aside from school that is. School is never fun. Ever. But aside from school, today was ok. I just said that. Anyway, after school me and Ryty went over Frank's house to jam. Actually didn't go that bad. They just have to learn some more songs and we'll be set. Last few days have been surprisingly nice. I was actually able to go outside and shoot hoops without getting pnemonia. And the ball stayed dry for more than one shot. But now today it had to rain. I hope we get no more snow ever. Bring on the summer. And now I am lacking things to write. Let's recap my day. Chemistry - Boring crap taught to us. Well, not really taught, more like our teacher writing it on the board (wrong to begin with), explaining it very poorly, and moving on with none of us knowing what just happened. Art - Eh, interesting. Test though, but everyone sorta fooled around. Not as bad as chem. Algebra II - Wow, this period sucked. Busy work galore. 56 factoring problems are enough to make me want to die. Spanish - Well, no bad day is complete without Spanish class. I swear this is the most boring and annoying class ever. History - Wow. You think it can't get worse than Spanish, but then you go to history. Double period too which makes everything even worse. Theology - Went to chapel. Did the stations. Listened to hokey music. Reflected. Listened to Joe sing. English - Project presentations. Not that bad, since none of the presentations were utterably horrendous. I was able to manage the last 40+ minutes of captivity and then finally I was free from the hell called school. So that is basically everyday of mine. Nothing changes. So exciting. So exciting...(drifts off and falls off chair) *zzzzzzzzzzz*  Listen to H.I.M.

      What a nice day out. Such a shame I'm cooped up inside the house because of my freaking leg. I would attempt to play basketball but I'll probably end up falling and hurting my leg even more. And I have driver's theory tonight. I hear this is pretty boring. Great. Just great. You think you'd get enough boredom for one day during one period of History class, and now I have driver's theory. Not cool. Tomorrow is the big game. Knicks -vs- Sixers. Of course Knicks will win. Wow these hex codes are  dumb.   Ashley is crazy and Listen to H.I.M.

      Ah yes it is finally the weekend. And a good one it will be indeed. Today we had a half day  because of th Bazaar (which sucked anyway) and we will have Monday off as well. Nice long weekend awaits. Such a shame it has to be plagued with a 12 page research paper. Oh well at least I'm on page 7 already. I feel like going outside for a little bit. I will continue this blog when I return.     (30 minute break)

      I don't think any amount of cruel words and comments will do justice to how miserable I feel right now. It's almost the end of school, and now we have to get this research paper done. Understandable. What boggles my mind is how the paper goes from 10 pages, double spaced, to 15 pages 1.5 spaced. Due in a week. Obviously we have no lives other than to complete this busywork that won't help us in life except to perhaps keep currency flowing by buying weapons to channel our anger through. Well, maybe not that severe, but you get the point. I just can't understand how the 9th grade's research paper is 2 pages double spaced and ours is blowing the top off the pointless retarded assignment meter. Between that and Chem I'm about to rip my head off and throw it at one of my teachers. I'm so unbelievably sick of school. But hey, at least it's almost over. Plus this week is the bazaar. Except I have to work the Kiddie Land garbage. Outstanding. You just wait until summer. Then these painfully boring and whiny blogs will turn into great hymns of rejoice.

      The close to a very uneventful weekend is near. But then again, that sounds like every Sunday night. Nothin much exciting happened on the weekend. Friday night I went out to the fantastic establishment called the Laurel Mall and walked around there for about 20 minutes. After browsing the same old stores, we went over to Gallery Of Sound to browse around the same old shelves of cds. Then we went to Radioshack and AT&T for some reason I'm unaware of before heading off to Damons to watch the games and play the trivia game there. (which we lost horribly) And boy did the Yankees get spanked. Saturday comes along and it's nice out so I go to play basketball with Neil, George and Greco. Nothing out of the ordinary. Except a good thing out of this weekend was the NFL Draft.   That's all I need to say. At least this week is the Hafey Bazaar. Ah yes. The bazaar. Where everyone goes to lose their money on the wheels and enjoy a nice waffle and ice cream. But at least it's an entire half day of nothing. Until then I shall be unhappy and melancholic. Well I guess I really can't complain.This school year is almost over and the year wasn't too challenging. And the end of the school year means the birth of that little span of happiness known as summer. Can't wait.  Listen to H.I.M.

      I think you should all know who I'm talking about throughout this post. I'm getting tired of his stupid antics. Maybe it's funny for a 2 second laugh, but now he's just getting plain annoying. "Blah Blah Russians suck blah blah Girnoble ha ha soccer players dying HEY this is not funny you little punks." Well since you have such good advice on what children now a days should be like, I have some advice for how good chemistry teachers should be like. 1. Before even diving into the subcategory of  Chemistry  teachers, here's a tip for  teachers in general: Enjoy what you do and be friendly around the kids. Seems our little treasure of a teacher doesn't enjoy what he does, since he doesn't even teach plus he hates kids. Here is a man who thinks it is morally correct for a parent to kill his child for being disobedient. Yo chief we're not some third world country who turns to cannabalism for a solution to our problems. Not a good mixture for a teacher. 2. At least know how to add 2 + 2. Good God is this guy's math terrible. Chemistry is alot of math and this guy doesn't understand that a line going THROUGH a little line makes it a *gasp* PLUS sign. Ah, yes, it's not just simply a misprint. 3. Learn to spell. Somehow he can manage to spell Hydrobromicthoriamcrap right, yet mispell proton. 4. Learn to read. Example: Problem A calls for hydrochloric acid to react with sodium chloride. Teacher turns around and writes HCl + NaOH. Now come on. Either he has a problem reading, or he can't remember for 5 seconds what he just read to when he writes it on the board. 5. Read the chapters and make sure the class understands before continuing. I guess our teacher went to butthead academy where he was taught to read two sentences and give us a complicated problem on material we don't know. 6. If you're going to show us an example, at least do it right. I can't count how many times we've been shown a problem with the wrong answer. Then we're all treated to the trademark "What?! Then how do you do it?" Ok. You're the friggin teacher I think you should know how do to do the problems. You did work for the government as a chemist. God is that scary. 7. You're "I'm-Angry-At-The-World-And-I'm-Going-To-Rant-About-What's-Wrong" act is getting very old. I really don't need to hear about how you're jealous of actors and how you don't understand tanning and how Russia and Africa and everyone else should copy us. So if you're going to tell a joke, don't play the role of the angry ignorant white homophobic man and rant about your problems. 8. And finally,  Take your head and remove it from the death grip your ass cheeks have on it.  I think it's safe to say we're all sick of you and your crappy teaching. 6 sections in one day? Come on now. Test every week? What are you thinking. I can't wait until I'm done with this year. So now after that agonizing long post about Chemistry, I shall go now.  Listen to H.I.M.

      "No I'm not moving your test tomorrow. I'm going to teach the rest of the day, no I'm not even gonna teach today. I'm gonna waste time moaning and complaining about dress code violators and then rush through the last two sections of the chapter so we have the test tomorrow. Hell I won't even explain this stuff. I'll read out of the book some of these steps and I'll let you figure it out for yourself. To be nice, I'm going to show you an example of this on the blackboard. Ungrateful kids out of dress code making me go to the board. Sheesh. But here you go all you little brats. And yes I did it wrong because I'm really not a Chemistry teacher. I was really a janitor at the physics lab in Washington or wherever I said I worked and just mugged one of the chemists and stole his lab apron. It was actually me who was responsible for causing a nuclear reaction in the lab and blowing up the entire building, spreading radioactive waste reaching out to a 5 mile radius of the explosion. All because I couldn't add 2 numbers correctly or read directions the way they were meant to be performed. But I'm glad this happened. Because I hate people and I hate children and I hope things return to the way they were in the 70's. Screw all of you. Your test is tomorrow and I hope you know it cause I sure don't. Class dismissed. I have to go get my son out of that tree again."  Listen to H.I.M.

      3 days of freedom. Well, 2 and a half. But I'll take what I get. Another good thing about this weekend is that it's supposed to be like 60°, 70° weather. Thank you God. After how many months I've been waiting, the nice weather is finally here. It better stay like this. So next week is gonna be pretty bad. Lotta work. Lotta crap. Eh same thing. I really can't wait until summer. I have to say though, this year wasn't too tough. Actually went pretty quickly in my opinion. I'm also glad to see that finally after all the practicing I do, I'm slowly becoming a semi-respectable guitarist. Until I master the No Boundaries solo by Michael Angelo, I will not be content with my skill. ....Which means I will never be content with my skill because that solo is just plain impossible. I bow down to that man. He is inhuman. Download it and see what I mean. Michael Angelo - Speed Kills.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Well Easter break is over. In my opinion it wasn't too cool. Weather was pretty bad, plus there really wasn't much to do. But I enjoyed the break none the less. Anytime we get off school is ok in my book. Except today. Today we had the misfortune of having a "health fair" all day.  Now you'd think hey, it can't be all that bad. Plus we don't have any classes. AND it's a Tuesday which means any other day we'd have to sit through a painstakingly long double period of Chemistry. So I thank God for saving me from that. But it was too good to be true, and indeed the presentations were extremely boring. Talk about clichés. Every speech was about crap we've been fed since 4th grade. Drugs, alcohol, sex, everything you're not supposed to do. It's not like we haven't heard this before. But hey, I can't complain since we had no classes. Well I'm glad to see we switch from internet explorer to Mozilla. So much better. So lately I've just been sitting around waiting for the weather to get nice again. Recording covers of songs. I notice the program I have makes me sound alot better than I am. But I won't complain.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Today was alright. Our emo band had a practice and wrote another original. Which really is cool, since we've only had two practices and we already have two originals. For all you slow folk out there, that means an original every practice. That's productive. Usually it takes me hours or even days to think of a good riff to play, but when we practice everything falls into place perfectly. It's also interesting since the originals done are more of a blend of genres than just one. So basically what I'm saying is we rule.   So here's to another long weekend. Tomorrow I'm going to Knobles, which is better than staying in Hazleton, but then again, anything is better than Hazleton. Last week was the last  full  week of school. Ah, just saying that makes me feel good. Yesterday we got our Chem tests back and everyone did outstanding. Anywhere from 50's to 80's for everyone. Until we started going over it and he realized he put questions on the test he said we didn't have to learn. So basically everyone's grade went up. But I'm still not too pleased. I just don't like that class too much. Shoot me. I think there's a general majority that feels the same way. But who cares, school is over.

      Maybe I should go over to the high school since obviously they don't do anything. Yeah you Ash. Punk. The girl who can go and post 10 million entries in school before 12 o clock. I really dislike Angelfire. I get a webshell, and then they delete it for some reason. Now I get another one and the images don't even work. Now I'm just a big billboard for Angelfire with "Image hosted by Angelfire www.angelfire.com" all over my blog. Well screw that. Summer's almost here anyway. I guess I'll be occupied with Community Park and ice cream lol. As long as I don't get run over by cars. Stay away from quizilla.com too. It does major damage to sanity. ONE TWO THREE NIL! Oh sorry. Still obsessing over this CD. God it's so good. Go out and buy 10 copies of Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses on May 25th. It's well worth it. Along with basketball and such in the summer (you're still gonna die from what you said about the Barbie), I'll also enjoy playing music again. Should be a great time since me, Adam, and Evan started a band. Should be interesting since Adam now is gonna play drums and Evan is gonna play bass. Summer is looking good indeed. Now it's just the agonizing last few days of poop until freedom and joy.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Today was sort of alright I would assume. We got out of school anyway and got to visit the Metropolitan museum in New York. Actually, the museum sucked. I'm not really into walking around looking at pots and naked sculptures. And the sad part was we were stuck there for about 4 hours. Bus ride up was routine I guess. Rousing card games a plenty. And I think I have a permanent jalapeno taste in my mouth from about 10 handfuls of flavored seeds. When we got there I had a feeling it would suck. I think I walked around more trying to find the cafeteria and bathrooms more than I actually looked at the artwork. Here we go. First, I get the urge to get something to eat. So we go to the "cafeteria", but all they were selling was like friggin apples and muffins. So I knew it couldn't have been the real cafeteria. So I say "let's look at the sign in the elevator to see where the cafe is". On the elevator, we go up to the second floor, somehow end up back on the first, then go back up to the second, go to the 4th, realize we can't get to the roof on this specific elevator for some reason, go back down to the second, find which elevator WILL take us to the roof, go to the first floor, walk to the elevator, go to the roof, and find another little crap muffin stand. My patience was running dry about now. We finally find the hidden cafeteria by going down a shady step of stairs. Hunger has taken over me by now and I pick up a sandwich and a coke. At least something to hold me over until dinner. I get in line, get my wallet out, and ....wait did I hear that right?! 7.50$ for my turkey sandwich and 2.50 for a Coke?? Now the sandwich was alright, but definately not worth 8 bucks. Plus, a bag of chips was 2.25$ and a cupcake was 3$. Now those prices seem a little high for me. I don't know where you buy potato chips but where I do they're definately not 2.50$ for a little bag. So after I finish my costly meal, we're back out in the museum for a game of hide and seek. Hey, there wasn't anything else to do. So we split up into teams, but realize we have to make rules since Wilson starts booking through the museum for the "base" we never made. Somehow it ends up with 4 people hiding throughout the entire museum and 10 people looking for them. So it starts off well enough until me and Jimmy get sidetracked looking at more important things (*cough* ladies *cough*) Somehow we meet up with Adam and Joe and realize we're not going to find 4 kids in the entire museum. So the search for clean bathrooms began. We walked to one bathroom, went in and took one sniff and left, but then walked around a little bit aimlessly and ended up back at the same restroom. About now we forgot about finding the lost 4 children and continued our search for bathrooms. After that, I guess we were way bored and went outside to watch all of the nice cars pass by. Until it started to rain. And when two guys from a building across the street kept eyeing us up. I found it funny however when a certain person was trying to hit a pigeon with a bottlecap got yelled at by some butch sitting by us. "Why are you throwing crap (PG version of the word she used) at the pigeons? What if I threw something at your head?" As we all just ignore her she keeps going. After our visit to the museum we board the great charter again and head home. I didn't realize it would be an hour before we ate again, so I was starving in the Lincoln Tunnel. I was ready to eat anything. When we finally got to McDonalds I ate like a pig. As I watched my classmates venture through the Play Place. Amusing how they're all way too big and about 100 lbs over the restrictions for the play place. So I was just waiting for Jeff or Wilson to break something. After McDonalds it was just the long stretch home. I was kept occupied by a certain Mike Dejoseph's hilarious prank phone calls. Absolutely hilarious. Somehow listening to random people get called up to participate on a fake country radio "trivathon" never gets old. Especially when they answer questions like "What religion are the Amish?" So that basically sums up the day. Nothing way out of the ordinary, unless you consider wandering through a big mofo of a museum fun. So after this extremely long post, I apologize. But I don't feel bad for the weird girl who enjoys spending hours working on calc homework.  Listen to H.I.M.

      You'll  never  catch me alive. NEVER. Oh....*clears throat*....sorry. Hold on I just need to take a minute to take in the beautiful Hazleton air on this fine Monday afternoon. Chemistry test wasn't completely unbearable. Aside from the fact he put a whole page on the test full of material he said specifically wasn't going to be on it. But who cares anyway. 12 days left. Or something around there. Whatever. I'll take my hat off to this great cd. That great cd would be The Used. Hey I just remembered tomorrow I'm going to New York. That sorta brightened the day until I remembered that it's for Spanish. I love how teachers ruin trips by making us do assignments relating to the topic. I'm more interested in going to New York and just walking around and taking in all of the art instead of searching and wasting time looking for Spanish art that I'll have to write about. To tell the truth, all I'm excited about is gettin out of an entire day of school.  And  tomorrow would be a double period of Chemistry. Thank the God watching over us, for he saved me from a certain demise. Any more Chemistry will probable drive me into insanity. It was a rough year, but it's almost over. Went quickly though. But I'll never forget you 2004. All of your good times. *Sniff* Yeah this year was just the same as every other and I doubt I'll ever look back on these years for happy memories. But overall I can't complain. Raise your drinks and make this toast to another fair year. Hurrah.   Listen to H.I.M.

      Everyone is complaining about Chemistry. I don't know why since I think that this stuff is pretty simple compared to previous material. Maybe it's due to my inability to complete the simplest of math equations. Oh well. So now I sit here in complete and utter boredom. Sunday's aren't really that great. They're still part of the much awaited and coveted weekend, but they just don't appeal to me. Maybe since I know in 24 hours I'll be sitting in an uncomfortable desk sweating to death listening to a whole mouthful of crap. Just the image in my head ruins the day. I'll try not to think about it again just because I might become nauseated. Such a shame that summer has to hide in school's buttcrack for so long. I wish it was here. I'm beginning to dread final exams. I don't even want to think about what the Chemistry exam will be like. Oh well. I'll wait to the very last moment possible to think about it.  I added a few things to this wonderful blog. Now you'll find a (drum roll please) wonderful clock located above Archives  just to let you know how much time you're wasting reading this pointless garbage. You'll also find some links to other sites you could possibly waste more time at. All of which receive my personal highest rating of 2 devil horns. Rock on. \m/ °_° \m/  Also, check out Ash's new blog. Uh, link is on the right, but for all you lazy folk, here it is:  urlLink Click here    Listen to H.I.M.

       Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there with open arms and open eyes.  Yeah it's really hot out. And in. I'm sweatin just sitting here. What else new. Nothing really. School still indeed sucks despite what some of you were thinking. Summer is still too far away. And so is my permit. Plus the whole blogger.com site has a new format so I am a little confused. Me being in my infinite knowledge and superior problem solving have come to the conclusion that I cannot handle anything more complicated than eating a sandwich. Anything beyond this difficulty causes severe brain damage and also physical damage to innocent bystanders. A sad realization I have no power over. Alright anyway. Cheese is good. Mmmm...sharp chedder. Indulge myself in little bite size chunks of heaven. And I have macaroni and cheese cooking right now. Noodles = good + Cheese = also good all = a bowl of tasty goodness.      So I'm sitting here playing my guitar and jammin to Led Zepplin. I've been basically learning Stairway to Heaven so I can play when we jam sometime in the near future. Cool song to play. Pretty easy too. Just what I like. And here you go. I hope this works.

      Just got back from the Neotaerik concert. All you losers who didn't go missed a good show. It was awesome. I even enjoyed getting thrown around in the pit. The show was really good and it's a shame not alot of people came. But a show is a show and I know I enjoyed myself. Plus I got to see Jeff eat 100 paintballs. Weird thing is that's not the first time he's eaten paintballs. That was basically the highlight of the weekend. Yesterday was plagued with bad allergies. 3 hours of sleep isn't really enough. And I'm not sure why Angelfire is being dumb and not showing my pictures. This is the fourth time I tried Angelfire as a webshell and each time it screwed me over. So until I can figure out what is wrong (which may be never), no pictures. Such a shame. I feel like making a long post because since no one reads this it really doesn't matter. But all of sudden I don't feel like making this long. All of a sudden I have the urge to have some eggs. Potato chip. Plastic bag, plastic bag, plastic bag, plastic bag....

      Well, it was a long week, but the research paper is finally finished. Most of it at least. It was painful and excruciating but I managed to refrain from ripping my head off. And the reward for completing a 12 page research paper is ....more assignments! Oh boy now we get to read a story about two gay kids jump out of a tree. Sounds like fun to me. Maybe even a tad bit more fun than that day I sat in a bucket of needles watching paint dry. I can't wait until summer. The whole school thing began to wear off in October and now it's just pointless. I'm sure I'm not the only kid who has this opinion. Now I will leave you all with a statement made by our own Adam Paris in Theology class: You know what Jesus really said when he was breaking the bread? Jesus:"I can't believe Dominos couldn't deliver tonight." Apostle:"Jesus, let it go man." Jesus:"No I wanted to treat you well and the Dominos man couldn't deliver and ...."

      Bazaar sucked.  Absolutely terrible. I wouldn't have spent a second there but I was sort of forced into labor because of the Spanish Honor Society. Me and Skelley had the misfortune of working the tic-tac-toe booth, though I can't say it was totally terrible. Not too many kids came to our stand, which is a good thing because I probably would have ripped on of their heads off. And my bad mood was due to the unacceptable fact that THERE WERE NO POTATO CAKES. That's what I was looking forward to-eating potato pancakes and maybe some waffles and ice cream. But as soon as I get a break from the tic-tac-toe stand, they're all sold out. Sold out of potato cakes? Unheard of. So yeah the bazaar pretty much blew this year. Actually, the entire weekend pretty much sucked. I've not really been myself these past couple of days due to something I don't feel like going into detail right now. Alright, I lost the interest to keep writing so this post is done.  Listen to H.I.M.

      Today was cool. Cross country practice was AWESOME. We had to do an hour jog and for some dumb reason I went A group today. But it was the best time ever. We went back to the Community Park trails, but ended up going every into little secluded half-covered in high grass paths. Thanks to our fearless leader, Bartol. Somehow we ended up in a bunch of swamps so I come up with the idea to go to the abandoned train station. Fun fun. On our way over we saw a bunch of pipes. Which made for some more fun. Hehe. After that we saw these big things with holes in them so we climbed through them. You'd swear we're still in pre-school. Then at the train station we had some more fun times. Best time at cross country this year. After that I layed around until like 12:50 when I realized I had bowling. Went there. Good time too. Did pretty bad though. Haha, Travis. ROB ZOMBIE. Charley sucks. I bet only one person knows what I'm talking about and everyone else thinks I am insane. Maybe. ...  ... Then after bowling (funny stuff there too right Ash), we walked over to Valley High because someone needed ice cream. After crossing the street and almost getting killed, we walked to the basketball courts to find Neil with a weedwhacker. Good idea though. After that I go to play volleyball. A little hard though when there's a huge clothesline right in the middle of the net. Fun nonetheless. Even though I owned in volleyball. After hanging around wasting away and hearing complaining the entire time we play more volleyball and I own it up again. Then somehow I get coaxed into playing *gasp* soccer for the first time in like 3 years. And I get smoked right in the shin. I should've seen it coming. And it's not funny. So yeah today was cool. I bet you're all bored reading this. Well tough. Get over it.    Please take these hands Throw them in the river, Wash away the things they never held Please take these hands, Throw me in the river, Dont let me drown before the workday ends.       -Thursday       For The Workforce, Drowning

      Didn't know anyone read this, but now that I do I feel an unbearable pressure to please this unseen audience. I dunno what to say. Inspiration isn't forced, it just comes. Whoosh. I want to go outside, but it's gonna rain. It's the case here in Hazleton. Either 150 degrees or rain, snow, hail, hell. I'm having requests now to put pictures in here. One was supposed to be of some dude either burning or I really don't know what's going on. And I really can't make a relation between a guy on fire, African tribes, and Dutch ladies without people thinking I'm on drugs. So here's one of a man named Carmelo Anthony. You may not have heard of him. He plays an unpopular sport called basketball for the NBA (whatever that is)

      Yesterday I went to play basketball. Realized I sucked. Went to Valley High. Tried to play basketball again. Still sucked. Went to basketball game. Left. Went to Burger King. Picked up Neil. Went back to play more basketball. Improved slightly. Looked across the street and saw a man shooting things. Sweated. Looked in the park. Saw hippie smoking a blunt. Laughed. Saw hippie practice his kung fu. Laughed harder. Saw hippie try to kick down trees, fence, benches. Laughed harder. Left. Slept. Woke up. Went to bowling. Realized I sucked at bowling too. 120 something, 110, 140. Came home. Played more basketball. Sat at computer. Wasted away staring at bright screen. My life in simple 1st grade level sentences. Hope you enjoyed. I know you didn't.  Listen to H.I.M., SOAD, & A7X. (The list gets longer everyday)

Which leads me to sitting here writing in my wonderful b-l-o-g. Summer is awesome. But I said that last entry. And I'll continue to type it since....well it is. I don't know what to say. Nothing really. I've been playing Avenged Sevenfold songs and System of a Down songs on my guitar. Sorta a pain when one band is in standard and the other is in a step down. I think. Right Side Of The Bed solo owns. Right. Bye. I can't think of anything to write anymore. Every entry is basically a bunch of random garbage that carries on the same topic everyday. Exciting stuff eh? That's what I thought. Keep reading punks. But I guess not since I have nothing else to say. So       bye?

That keeps everyone on the edge of their seat. Jhea man. English isn't for me. Either is blogging. Screw this.

      You can apply this post to last night I guess. So we (Me, Justin, Joe, Snatch, Yale, Dave) went over Dave's house. We walked over to Arthur St. playground to play and of course it has to start pouring. So like idiots we kept playing. 2 on 2 on 1 Taps doesn't work well at all. After that crappy game we went back to Dave's to play pool and just hang out. He put in the movie Honey and the only reason I can see why anyone would want to see it is 1. You're some girl who enjoys dancing movies or 2. Because Jessica Alba is so amazingly beautiful. So yeah, I watched it and I can confirm option number 2. I also confirmed that I suck at pool. 0-2. Then one of the funniest things of the night occured. Dominic left his keys on the coffee table and Murph took them. Which leads to his car being parked in an alley. Which leads to Dominic running..no sprinting toward us screaming "I'M GONNA KILL ALL OF YOU". Which leads to everyone running in different directions. I don't know what happened next since I headed back toward the house, but I did hear his car alarm go off. Funny stuff. Take your pick: sweet, dark, or rancid chocolate. We're so retarded.    Listen to H.I.M., A7X, the Used, and Thursday :)

I've never played that long before, and I wasn't getting bored either. Aside from sitting around thinking of a song to play, it was awesome. Before that I went on a run with Dave and found out how out of shape I really am. Hopefully that will change soon because if not I'll be screwed for the season. Now I'm bored.

The input on my guitar always gets loose, but I try to fix it today and *snap* the wire snaps off. Great. No guitar. This is terrible. It's your fault.

      Well, I made it. Chemistry is over. It felt so good to hand that book in. Well, the exam was actually the opposite of what I expected: it was kinda really easy. And History, well. Alot of BS on those essays. But at least the two hardest are done. 2 down, 4 to go...

      Yesterday was awesome. It was our field trip to Hershey Park and boy it was great. I'll recap all I can remember. For days before the field trip, people have been saying that we may have to take school buses up to Hershey. It was one of those things that you say better not happen, but they always do. So yeah we took school buses up. And of course we got a pretty nasty bus driver. But don't we always. When we got to the park we said that we shouldn't split up like last year. But as time went on, we split up, so that was useless. First ride was The Great Bear if i recall correctly. Oh yes. I felt special since we were the first in line. But we had to wait like 10 minutes before they tested the rides a million times. (Which didn't help some rides..I will explain later) It was cool though none the less. After the Great Bear, our group (which ended up being Me, Murph, Nick, Dominic, Caroline basically) headed over to the new ride, the Storm Runner or whatever. It looked awesome, and turned out being even better. The ride is cool since it shoots you up this vertical opposite loop kinda thing really fast. But yeah. Next was the Sidewinder which turned out being the best part of the day. Not because of the ride however. Me, Nick, Justin, and Bethany were in line looking for good looking women when we saw one of the hottest girls we've ever seen. I mean amazing. I couldn'believe my eyes. So basically the rest of the day we were looking for her. After this, we met up with Jimmy and them and then went to the Lightning Racers. We may have gotten a little too into it since we made teams and were trash talking the entire time. Turns out we had to wait 10 minutes anyway since they were fixing the other track or somethin like that. We lost anyway. Our trip on the Wildcat was a little strange. All day I was praying that we wouldn't get stuck on a ride since alot of rides have ben stalling and what not. So we're riding the Wildcat and we get to the very top of the first hill and.....it stops. I started freakin out, Kuklis was going to start calling people, Murph was checkin what was going on, and all I hear is Wilson: "Is it just me or does anyone else find this HILARIOUS??" Yeah I was gonna punch him. When it finally started moving again it sounded like it came off the track. Not good. But anyway, after that we just walked around. Watching Nick walk up to random girls asking them to pet his pink dolphin. Funny stuff. So yeah yesterday was pretty cool indeed. Fun times. Let's hope this last week of school goes quickly. I hate exams...

      Wow, the school year is finally almost over. Just tomorrow and then field trip Friday. Next week will be easy except for exams. I'm dreading the Chemistry exam but whatever. Looking back, this year actually went pretty quickly compared to other years. Comical conversations and antics helped this year move on easier. Chemistry was painful, but it's finally over. Art class was a dissapointment, but we still squeezed every ounce of fun we could out of B period. Math was awesome this year I must admit. Mrs. Parsons was ...well  ... and Mr. J rules. So many good and random conversations in that class. Spanish was similar to Chemistry: painful. Lunch this year was ridiculous. History was pretty boring, but it was ok. Theology was retarded. It was a bit of a change from last year (work 15 minutes of class then free period/open notebook tests/open notebook and work with a partner exam). English was ok except for the god awful research paper. So I guess I can't complain too much about this past year. It could have been alot worse also. So here's to another year. Scarfaceology 101 is in session.   P.S. - Thanks for the dollar. Shady. Very shady.

      (Miss Connelly is arguing with I believe Mike Donati....so Nick Wilson does his trademark...) Wilson: "Punch her in the face!" Miss Connelly: "(looks at Nick) That's it. Get out." Wilson: "No Miss Connelly, it was a joke. An inside joke. (rant rant on Wilson's typical explanations-that-make-no-sense-but-he-tries-to-sound-intelligent)

      Sort of a shame that vacation is like half over already. It's been going well so far though. Nothing really exciting has been happening though. Just ordinary crap. Like playing with water balloons and a giant slingshot. It works great (We were standing on the side of the basketball court and a balloon managed to clear the other side of the fence and half of the road.), but it would work even better if we had 3 people. This is the cue for all of you people to come to the court and enjoy the giant slingshot with us. Yes it was wishful thinking. But hey, how can't you have fun when the warning on the slingshot reads:    Warning! Balloons can reach or exceed a speed limit of 75 mph. Never shoot at another person

Took me about a month to figure out the tab though. But it's worth it, since this song owns everyone. Surprisingly, this is my own work since no tablature site had the music. I would have taken the easy way out and gotten a tab, but instead I wrote my own. Sounds near perfect. But who cares since no one plays guitar. Well, maybe like 4 or 5 people. So this one's for you. Why did I waste so much time doing that? Oh well. Everyone who plays guitar...LEARN THIS SONG.

      1. I suck at mini golf. 2. It's harder to inflate a pool than it seems. 3. I'm better at half court shots than 3 pointers. 4. Creepy guys with fanny packs never cease to scare me.

      Ahh, humor me for a second. Thanks to a good blog post and a wonderful picture, I was sent back 10 years in my life. I found myself sitting in those tiny friggin desks in pre-school. The good ol' days. I really don't remember much about pre-school. My teacher's name was Wendy I believe. After seeing that picture of my class, I don't even remember half of those kids in my class. I looked like a retard. Just smaller. Ratman still looked like a rat. Just smaller. And he's makin a cool face in the picture. Joseph looks the same. If that is Zach Smith then he seems to still not know what's going on. But we love Zach. He's awesome. Lindsay still looks the same just smaller in that pic. Sarah looks the same, but with shorter hair. I think. Yeah. Let's see who else is here. Vanessa Kaschak, Bianca Roman, Alicia Uliano, Veronica Nelson. Ward. Wasn't too wide back in the day. That's surprising. Lol just kidding Chris. And last but not least Skulldoggg. Still looks the same, just without the mop on his head. So basically, not alot of us changed too much. Maybe we got slightly more immature, but hey.    urlLink Here is the link to the picture. Sarah's site.  Go to main content and scroll down. See P-Rod in cool highwaters.

      Sad when the best thing we could think of to do was go to Wal Mart. Even worse we actually spent about 20 minutes thinking of what to do. It's sort of depressing when you say everything in each possible direction you could go and everything is the same or not worth giving a minute of your time. 2 more years...
