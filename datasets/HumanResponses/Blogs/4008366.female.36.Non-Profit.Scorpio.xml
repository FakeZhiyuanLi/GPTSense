       apparently downstairs from me. after all it couldnt be those nice cali boys coming in at 4am then blasting rap music and talking smack could it? meanwhile back at building 10,greg has completely lost his mind. calling my house cursing and muttering/stuttering incoherently angrily at my vic. you know,no one likes to be dumped.no one likes to get their heart stomped but,dude,really get some pride, and assaulting a young woman is not really apropriate no matter what. your'e hurt,your'e upset ,your'e angry,filled with resentment are ya?swell , now be a man and shut up about it.honestly. made chili for dinner. it was great.im up at this hour listening to the idiots downstairs ,cant sleep,feel crappy, its just not good. i should be a pill tomarrow.--amy

Had a good time but paitience always runs short after drinking. Have gotten&nbsp;an unsatisfactory email from victoria and a cryptic phone message. hope shes alright. she better be.&nbsp; we're all in a tangle here its hardest for icky , i remember her age myself. sometimes i think if i hadnt gotten married so young id be dead. if my partying hadnt had an early end, if creating a family hadnt fuffilled my and absorbed all my energy its likely id have imploded.&nbsp; i cooked tonight,dinner was good. ran around a bunch today. am sending a trade to italy sorry gotta leave.--amy

       having a significant other who cooks is a lovely lovely thing,truely one of lifes great joys. awakening from a nap to find dinner a done deal... priceless!steaks and onions and mushyrooms garlic rice and corn. who's better than me?nobody baby, nobody. i need to dye my roots. my very blond hair needs attention cause it aint blond.and my greys are coming in curly/wavy after a life time of pin straight hair. i dont even know as yet whether we will be going out tonight. im not watching unbreakable as we speak ,or rather as i type. ive never seen it wish someone would just explain it to me.

      now look,i hate cleaning. i am not good at"straightening up" i dont care if ive got the tits,and all day to clean, it is not in my power to do this stuff regularly or well. i am very up front about this at the start. i was a bad wife twice before,why why why is this suddenly some kind of friggin mystery? oh never mind. most women live to have things look nice.why dont i care? hell if i know. i dont mind cooking,i like it. but this endless-putting -stuff-where-it-belongs shit is pure nonsense. i hate my life.oh to live alone and answer to no one.

      well we're ruminating on websites and message boards and forums. how is it that one or a few nameless faceless souls can ruin,tear apart an online community like this? and more importantly,why? why do they want to,the web is infinite cant they find something to intrest them in its vastness. is it the destruction of peaceful people having interesting intelligent conversations that spurs them to these acts of verbal vandalism, who knows? but i do know from the lofty heights of my soap box,that to do nothing when they violate a forums space is wrong we have gatherd for a purpose .banish the jackals for the greater good. that is all. i need to shower and get ready-amy

       so the phone rings.yeah i hate that. it does it a bunch,several times in fact. and since its being insistent i crawl from my bed and lo and behold...no ones dead or anything cool,but vic needs to alight. its raining shes been to the court house and is not thrilled. so now theres two of us not thrilled. she shows up and my glasses are mia.so i stomp about searching while the vicster regales me with tales of the court house. her morning at the court house was the result of dating a genuine unwell ,lunatic,dangerous felon. aparently the courthouse was a veritable carnival of miscreants. the way one separates refuse for disposal ,we as a people should seperate the great unwashed from,well, &nbsp;me.nothing like being searched at the door,made to empty ones purse in front of god and everyone while surrounded by crack heads and wife beaters eh? i feel her pain,i do ive been to our illustrious court house with a crack head ex boyfreind a few times.and it is really frickin creepy. its raining.which is cool my flowers will be pleased. its a friday so the weekend stretches ahead unsullied as of yet by arguments,hangovers,and the like. there will be more,much more much to my chagrin.-amithany
