       All will be revealed if I can only stop thinking.  If only I could stop thinking. [silence]  Was that me not thinking?  Oh shit, I am thinking right now.  I should stop thinking.  [silence]  I need to stop thinking about thinking.  Not thinking is hard work.  Oooh, that was a pretty bird.  I need to not think.  Maybe if I unfocus my eyes I won't think.  [silence]  Why does everything look like its waving?  Where did it go?  Oh no I'm thinking!   I know, I know, its complete nonsense.  But that is where I found myself quite frequently when I started meditating.  I believe the secret to passing this stage is in realizing that the important thing is not to STOP the mind from working, but instead to realize that it is working and simply be aware of it (ie realize that it is not you but merely a small component of the overall system).  The more you lessen the value of your consciousness, the greater the stress it is capable of handling as well as a sharp increase in your ability to utilize it most accurately.  A more powerful consciousness results in a heavier shovel able to dig increasingly deeper and deeper into the crust of buried subconscious and into the great unknown core of the unconscious.  I'm saving up for a mental construction equivalent to that contraption made in  Journey to the Center of the Earth .

      Since the dawn of time man has wondered, "what the fuck is life supposed to be about anyways, yo?".  Ok, maybe not, but as far as the dawn of this man's time is concerned that has always been a question of high priority.  Perhaps the plethora of silly answers I've recieved and come up with in regards to the question is a sign indicating the idiocy of its form.  Getting down to the essentials of the mind in the reality of all realities, one must eliminate all preconcieved notions that are not directly observable through the senses.  Down in this land of no assumptions, conscious thoughts are held in check by the chaos it beholds in an interconnected and intraconnected, infinitely-variable, multiple-realmed universe of unintelligible complexity.  Any assumption uplifts the conscious from its base at the root, and sends it into a conscious relm of fantasy and non-reality.  It is from the root that the mind is capable of working at its greatest.  Thoughts start directly from their base of sensoral input, and grow from there, utilizing tricks of thought expansion that have been developed in memory.  When one has a mind that is meddling its affairs in preconcieved notions, archtypichal structures, or symbolic recollection the root of sensoral perception is never reached, and instead is only pretended to be observed.  In essense, the conscious mind intercepts the sensoral energy with its own idea of reality.  Clearly, this is a limiting factor.  So that is what I'm going to try to show with this blog; the search for my root, the center, the eternal emptiness, whatever word description that best depicts understanding of the intuitive notion of infinity.  The deeper my comprehension of infinity the closer I come to understanding the universe and my interaction with it.  And I'll try not to always be so boring about it.  After all, life should be fun, no?

       Here once stood a treasure of monumental splendor.  It was once so symmetric, so beautiful, so immensely perfect, but now it is gone.  When I look at it from one side I can see only its shadow.  Shifting to the other end I see shadow shrinking into nothing.  Itâ€™s sliding into the center of itself, forever shrinking in halves until too small to perceive logically.    In this act of disappearing into nothing we can see the contrast between the world of the intellect and the world of intuition.  The world that we see consciously is a world of symbolic representations acted upon by other mental constructions that compare these symbols.  If, as illustrated above, we were to realize that a symbol was not actually reality, the object we perceived would change in proportion to the amount allowed by the ego.  Now, its symmetries would be replaced by irregularities, its beauty consumed by fresh thoughts like mosquitoes attacking a new-born infant in the wilderness.  This is the other side, where we have replaced the one symbol with another, a process we can repeat ad infinitum if we are not aware.  Being completely aware, living in the moment with the universe around us, requires staying on the intuitive center of the brain, where self, chaos and infinity are at one in understanding.
