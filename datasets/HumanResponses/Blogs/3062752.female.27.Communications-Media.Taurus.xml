       chaos theories   I feel responsible for making other people suffer. And I am none too pleased about it at this moment.  It's funny-you want other people to care you exist, and then someone cares you exist more than anything. And then your existance is making other people miserable somehow. And then it would be easier if you didn't exist at all.I just went and reread that and was astounded by how stupid it looked in type.  I feel too involved, as if I'm only making things harder somehow. I want to help him, and really, I can't.This part is his path, and while it might seem as if a lot of it is about me, I think it's more about him than anybody. His choices, his feelings. What he's denied himself. I feel I need to step back somehow and give him room to breathe, and so I try to keep my hands off my phone. I try to keep my selfishness to myself. I I kick myself for some of the shit I say. I want to move all of my thoughts to the back burner. It makes me stare in the mirror. It makes we wonder what there is in me that would ever be worth so much to another person that they'd go through this amount of grief for it.  I've lost my ability to get thought out, for now.

       lightness and weight      "There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison. We live everything as it comes, without warning, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehersal for life is life itself? That is why life is always like a sketch. No, "sketch" is not quite the word, because a sketch is an outline of something, the groundwork for a picture, whereas the sketch that is our life is a sketch for nothing, an outline with no picture." -Milan Kundera   There simply is nothing sure.This series of decisions comes to you, one after another, and how do you react to what you've never experienced before? Mistakes are inevitable. My unusual lack of guilt has allowed me to learn from mistakes more objectively.The way I feel about chances is that I have to take them. Even the things that have scared me most-I'm still determined to push past that.I'm not a person who can live with the regret of not knowing.Sometimes, I see so much possibility at once that it stuns me, I know the only thing I can do is choose carefully and with conviction.   "Without you I am a broken circle,  a phoenix without wings,   empty of your magic.  Will the sand one day                  be kind,  Allow me to close the distance and                 touch you again?"                             -untitled   His calm is better for him. It also scares me. I know his unbelievable power. I know he can talk himself into or out of anything. I know I must not have hope for anything beyond the path of my own life that I create. And regardless of whether he follows his truest impulse or continues on with his greatest deception, my life has to progress. The familiar can be so tempting... It's so much easier than risk.A few months ago losing what was familiar to me felt like it would kill me, and as time passes I realize losing it was one of the best things that ever happened to me. This is a stronger self than I have ever known before. Beneath even the dissention, I still feel I am happy throughout. I didn't realize what a huge portion of my personality was swallowed up in the need to be accepted by someone who never would be able to accept me. Having that back is indescribable.  I'm so tired.I have to be more awake tomorrow.

       who slipped me all this acid?   I re-purchased 2 of my stolen cd's, one of them being the Lamb What Sound reissue, which I wanted anyway. I also downloaded 3 of the complete cd's I lost.I called the shop I bought the purse at this morning and was told my purse had been one of a kind. Oh well. Paid a bill instead, which was probably the much wiser thing to do.  so then Susan and I chatted for a few hours about things. And I sat around and wondered at the feeling of being the type of woman who breaks up a person's marriage. Don't they call us Homewreckers?Sounds like a hip hop ensemble.The Homewreckaz.Where my bitches at?  I had really gotten to a point of skepticism about marriage. I mean, I have my opinions. Not being religious I  have different thoughts on it than most, but nothing you haven't heard before. I think it's a overanalyzed symbol. I think it's too much power given to a sheet of paper. I think we set ourselves up for failure by believing marriage is the goal of life. It's surely not the goal of mine. I have all these negative points on it, but a small part of me still believed-it could work. With the right combination of man and woman, woman and woman, man and man....every once in a while, people got lucky. And it really did work.And although loving a person that way was rare, it was also  possible.   I feel a thousand things. I'm exhausted.I don't want to hurt others. I'm scared to death. I'm calm. I miss him. I'm fine by myself. It's all a dream. It's all real. At this point, patience is all there is.  The sheets feel amazing and cool against my naked legs.I can't believe this life.

       good morning, hangover   i can't do any fucking work today. luckily there really isn't any to do. i made a few phone calls and now i'm just kind of sitting here.i'm calm.i'm tired.i feel emotionally wasted.and yet somehow i feel stronger than i would have in the past. usually i have so much to say but i just can't say it right now.  i feel remarkable about changing blogs. is that weird? i'm big on clean starts. i like the idea of leaving the old LJ behind and leaving everything in it behind. just my usual symbolism, i guess. i'm feeling listy. that's my new word for when i like to make lots of lists. i'm working on my to-do list and my what cd's were stolen from my car list.(yeah,my car got thefted saturday.) that was another one of those situations where my reaction surprised me. i hadn't even recorded the charge in my checkbook for the purse that got stolen yet-it was only a few days old. but somehow i found myself saying, "it's just stuff." a few years ago i would have been screaming and pounding on my car horn. it feels good to be able to just let shit go.  i'm gonna go type a letter so I don't fall completely asleep.

       this morning i had to let go    Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field.  I'll meet you there.   When the soul lies down in that grass, the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase each other doesn't make any sense.  -Rumi

       standing on the edge of my life   if i could die this very moment. i wouldn't fear. for i've known completeness, like being here. wrapped in the warmth of you. loving every breath of you. still my heart this moment...or it might burst. wanna stay right here. till the end of time. till the earth stopped turning. wanna love you till the seas run dry. i've found the one i waited for. the one.  all this time i've loved you. and never known your face. all this time i've missed you. and searched this human race. here is  true peace.  here my heart knows calm. safe in your soul. bathed in your sighs.  would you stay right here till the end of time. till the earth stopped turning. wanna love you till the seas run dry. i've found the one i've waited for. the one.   all i've known. all i've done. all i've felt was leading to this. all i've known. all i've done all i've felt was leading to this.   -Lamb,Gorecki

       choking for breath   everything was fine. And now suddenly I feel fucking completely insane. I have zero justification for this. I feel like an alien landing somewhere I've never seen. Suddenly yesterday, panic seized me-I haven't had a panic attack in years. god please help me find a way to fix this today.

       not really long enough to make a post   but I was thinking yesterday about that year I spent "loving you", or so I thought, and I realized that I don't even know what I loved about you. I thought you were very special-but having met many people since with the same intrests as myself, I realized that that wasn't unique at all. I usually find every person have some value, and you did in that I learned something valuable from you being a compulsive liar.But beyond that...I really don't think you had much value at all. I think perhaps you were the last sputter of a light in my life too long lit. The only thing I wonder, as I look at a picture of myself during that time, was  where was I in my mind that I let myself be so involved in that-how did I delude myself so deeply?   I've been thinking a lot lately about the specifics of loving people. They can fool you, but also you can fool yourself. Completely. And it makes me very suspicious and very careful. Ive been digging lately-trying to find the source of all this within myself. I hate that I can't keep going on this but I have to go.

       exhaustion wouldn't even begin to describe it   I have no reason to worry. It;s always overanalyzing that gets me in trouble. A tone of voice, certain words. My patterns of the past scare me sometimes. I'm just pouring my exhaustion and irritation into everything and I need to stop it and go to sleep. ok. I'm going. Gone.

       etc   It's been pouring rain on and off all day. I want to lie in bed reading and listening to the sound of it for hours on end.  The Patron party for work was 6-9 tonight. It was nice. I like my job, I like being around these people. I like working with someone I'm so close to. And I really like my boss because she's kooky and erratic and best of all, a real person. Corporate rules do not apply here. You make your own. Which works for me. We have the auction itself tomorrow which may or may not be rescheduled due to weather, and for which I  genuinely can't wait to be over. We've done a tremendous amount of work for it, and I frankly wonder what the response will be.  Lately no matter how much I sleep I'm still tired.

       your own live pornography   You know that feeling you get when you're making out with a guy that you want to fuck so bad you can taste it, but you're not going to get to? And your whole body is soaked with sweat and your thighs are soaked because you want to fuck desperately and there's nothing you can do about it? Now imagine every pore in your body pushing out that arousal, soaking every inch of your flesh with slick excitement...and you've got some idea of what it's like to see Peaches live. It was so hot in there because there were so many people and everyone was pushed so close together that after 2 songs you were covered in sweat. It was painful and uncomfortable but somehow wonderful at the same time. You couldn't even move without getting smeared with someone else's sweat. And normally that would be disgusting but here somehow it was good. When she played Fuck the Pain Away she started screaming to have people get up there on stage and help her sing it. I literally clawed my way up there. I FUCKING SANG FUCK THE PAIN AWAY WITH PEACHES ON STAGE LIVE TONIGHT. JESUS FUCKING HOLY MOTHER OF FUCKING CHRIST.  And it's now nearly 5 am and I'm hungry and not tired enough to sleep and somehow I have to make it all happen, but for whatever I suffer tomorrow that shit was so fucking worth it

        An unbearable lightness....   I come here to write, and I settle down to my usual dissection process, and then realize I have nothing to dissect. I have no weird words or actions to figure out, no hurtful things to try to rationalize, and nothing to fear in the future. This is what it feels like to be calm, and it's unsettling at first. You're used to flailing wildly, grasping to get a hold of something, exerting all your effort into reassembling the pieces into a formation that somehow makes some crippled sort of sense. It's like your own personal Holy Grail quest, and you'll never admit to anybody how very important it is to you that somehow you unearth these elusive solutions you were looking for with such passion. After all, suffering is mistaken for passion all the time. And in turn, passion is mistaken for lots of things. I have to practice my footsteps settling into the grooves of it. But I think I can get it. Looking back I see how long I must have perpetuated this stupid cycle of stress, how much emotional pain I was in-I was literally welcoming it. I can't imagine how I could have done this.  This weekend is literally madness. I can't wait to get to the other end of it. We saw Jason's apartment today. He finds out on monday if it's his. When we drive he points out things that I'm totally missing, even though I think I see a lot of things other people don't. The tiny purple flowers in the grass next to the highway-the smallest bits of beauty. While I'm being impatient, I look and he's watching the movement of trees in the wind. It's astonishing and humbling. It makes me want to discard this conditioned human shell even more.

      I can't speak either. I can't speak. I can't speak. I have no words.  I held your small body, so many times. I held it under the humid light and under the freezing artificial air. I held a bond that I could not understand. You danced, your own rhythm which I tried to memorize. We laughed and I listened to your laugh. I held tight. Trying not to forget. Not to take for granted, the smell of the air the last time I held you close and you belonged to me in some impossible fashion.  EVERYTHING IS UNRESOLVED. Always. Because beginnings and endings are something that people create in their minds. A travelmark that we use to understand experiences. There's just a period of time, 60 or 70 years, that we separate any way we wish. Just make it yourself.  Make it. There is no way for anyone else to make it for you.  It's senseless and I don't care. I don't. I'm selfish. I don't need anyone to understand it but me. It won't work out. There is no way to neatly iron it. A minimum of clarity which one can possess. I'll do my best, to make sense of it.  I love you. I've always loved you, the moment I saw your face swim out of those other familiar faces. The time I had with you was precious time. Without you I could not have survived the wrongs done to me at the time. Much less the wrongs I did to myself. Every moment you were there, like a husband, like a partner of the most ideal caliber. In your silence I saw shapes. I read their meaning and absorbed them. I laid in the dark with you, near the beginning. It was still cold. Remember? Your blankets were thin and we were trying to share them and you said, wait, I have this song that I want to play. And you played it and I laid there in the silence next to you and tried not to burst. The moments like that are few and far between. Lying there not as human beings but as something so much purer than that. Listening as our heavy skins melted away.  In the distance you move and I am too full to do anything but watch. Departures hurt people, I know. But the truth is, these spaces have no power.

       the beautiful morning   "My life goes on in endless song above earth's lamentations, I hear the real, though far-off hymn that hails a new creation.  Through all the tumult and the strife I hear its music ringing, it sounds an echo in my soul. How can I keep from singing?  While though the tempest loudly roars,  I hear the truth it liveth. And though the darkness 'round me close, songs in the night it giveth.  No storm can shake my inmost calm While to that rock I'm clinging. Since love is lord of heaven and earth, how can I keep from singing?  When tyrants tremble in their fear and hear their death knell ringing, when friends rejoice both far and near how can I keep from singing?  In prison cell and dungeon vile our thoughts to them are winging, when friends by shame are undefiled how can I keep from singing?"  -Traditional Shaker Hymn

       sneaky posts   Josh is leaving this week, Jason is moving here this week. For some reason the merge of this events is strangely symbolic to me although it may mean nothing at all.  There's so much I want to say and I wouldn't even know where to begin. I mostly wander around overwhelmed and sort of semi-awed. I keep wanting to express myself somehow but keep struggling. I try to archive the change somehow, to grasp it as it moves so quickly by me.  I mean I ALWAYS come here thinking I'm going to know what to say.  Jason and I talk two hours every night. It feels like 2 minutes. It doesn't even scratch the surface. There's a huge gap between the actual connection and what is familiar. Blindly we try to walk across. I have to push certain thoughts down, even though they're never far from my tongue.  It's time to travel soon. James, could I come and see you?

       Forward movement   I dreamt of Shadow last night. It's been a long time since I dreamt of her. In the dream I kissed her cheek and was amazed by the softness of her skin. I miss her.  What a great q and a James! Send Leslie my thanks.   if i were anything but me............... If I were a month, I would be October. If I were a day of the week, I would be Sunday.  If I were a time of day, I would be 11:52 pm. If I were a planet, I would be Jupiter. If I were a sea animal, I would be a dolphin. If I were a direction, I would be forward. If I were a piece of furniture, I would be a wooden shrine. If I were a historical figure, I would be Buddah. If I were a liquid, I would be water. If I were a stone, I would be granite. If I were a tree, I would be a Cherry Blossom tree. If I were a bird, I would be one of those tiny birds that hops around with both feet. If I were a tool, I would be an icepick. If I were a flower, I would be an orchid. If I were a kind of weather, I would be the gentlest rain. If I were a mythical creature, I would be the last unicorn. If I were a musical instrument, I would be a flute treasured by a bard that lived long ago. If I were an animal, I would be a puppy that is very excited and trips a lot. If I were a color, I would be a light turquoise green. If I were an emotion, I would be empathy. If I were a vegetable, I would be the carrot. If I were a sound, I would be birds singing at dawn in an empty forest. If I were an element, I would be hydrogen. If I were a car, I would be a white 1924 vintage Rolls Royce. If I were a song, I would be Rustavi's Choir "Orovela." If I were a movie, I would be confusing to the masses and perfectly clear to a select few. If I were a book, I would be a well worn leather journal. If I were a food, I would be edamame. If I were a place, I would be Tokyo. If I were a material, I would be cotton washed a hundred times until it is thin like silk. If I were a taste, I would be the freshest peach spilling arcross your tongue. If I were a scent, I would be the smell of skin. If I were a word, I would be ubiquity. If I were a body part, I would be the collarbone. If I were a facial expression, I would be calm. If I were a subject in school, I would be recess. If I were a shape, I would be the shape of the moon in the sky.

       8 am   I miss sitting at my own computer to make updates. Usually I would make updates every day but lately I really haven't known what to say.  Yesterday was beautiful and dreamlike. The water was beautiful by the coast. When I got home I had this feeling of everything being unreal. I still have it.  I never could have dreamed this year. It has had 5 years worth of events crammed into it. And that's only been from January to April. Really, I worry about how much more I could take.  It's vague, I know. Sorry. I don't have the skills of communication to clear it yet.

       happy as a clam  Josh made the best dinner. Mango pasta with soybeans and edamame in the most luscious sauce ever. Yum-o-rama. I wanna take a bath in it. Funny thing is it looked that way in the bowl BEFORE HE COOKED IT. Ryan bought wine and i am satisfied in a way i havent been, foodwise, in a while. Sometims life is so goddamn great, and yes, I know I was totally confused 5 hours ago, thank you very much.  Jen rocks my world. Woman I wish you were here even for 24 hours sometimes. That is so not a proper sentence. Anyway. I WILL make sure I meet you one day-at which point, be prepared to be crushed in the biggest, most thankful hug ever.  My weekend's shaping up. We just got our Kill Bill tickets for tomorrow. No one ever wants to go to movies on opening night with me, I'm so happy we're going. It's going to be fun. Saturday we're going to French Quarter Fest to enjoy beautiful weather-maybe I'll even get some sun.....and then going to see the newly opened Shim Sham that night. And sunday I'm going to Biloxi.....to meet a very special dog and hang out with his dad. :)  Content is...nice.

       etc   Truth of the matter is, I didn't need anyone to like him. Since I had loved him for the past 9 years of my life,this was hardly my concern.  The truth of the matter is I don't know WHAT THE FUCK I AM FEELING RIGHT NOW.  It's scary to get in there and find this blank slate. Maybe that's just the reaction to overload. It all gets wiped clean. Who knows. I don't expect anybody to try to understand.  I need to reach back and find the woman that was starting to emerge, after I realized what a waste of time my last psuedo relationship was. I liked her. I was excited about learning her, finally, after all this time.

      A full 48 hours later. Brain still not functioning fully. Having a terrible time focusing on anything, especially at work. Funny enough, my mind is full of poetry. I keep thinking did I remember to say this? That? And I have to make those cd's. Did I pull out that book? That dvd? An amazing amount of thoughts. All trying to organize themselves. And failing. I am not in a state that's to be organized.  Went for a walk. The muscles in my legs feel like guitar strings being plucked. Odd sensation. I swear I'm going to walk every day. I'm writing it here so I'll feel guilty if I don't do it. Because I'm tired of feeling like a big fat warthog snuffling around in my own dirt.

       well fuck.   i'm aggravated, and it's petty, so if you don't want to hear me bitching uselessly turn back now. Williams-Sonoma called me and once again had me on for two shifts, one being tomorrow night and the other wedensday. She asked me point blank whether or not I would be able to give her a straightforward schedule or not and I told her I wasn't going to be able to, so I wanted to resign. Somewhere in the middle of this babble I said I would work tomorrow because I felt GUILTY. SO now I'm working 10-5 here and then I have to kill 2 hours so I can go work 7-10 there. And the pay is laughable. It's not even worth the gas money. So what should I do? Get through it and be glad it's over, right? Grrr. No, I have to find a way to stick up for myself here. I'm tired of doing things I don't really want to do because I feel guilty.  I'm so restless today. I just want to go running out of here and get home. I think I need to go for a walk. I think I need to do anything that will help to still my mind a little. I'm angry at myself because I am so fragmented. I know that these periods of time coexist with calmer ones, and I must be patient and try to just move through it. I have to find the center I keep talking about finding. I know it's there, waiting for me to pay attention to it.

       impermanence   it's ALL about you, isn't it? You're not the only one putting your life on the line. I'm sorry mine isn't as defined, locked down as yours is. I made a point of not committing to anything I wasn't sure of, so I'm not stuck anywhere I don't want to be. There's the big difference. I'm not sitting in my fucking castle up here waiting for Prince Charming. You're just prolonging the inevitable and for some reason you want to draw it out. Well great. Draw it out. In the meantime I have to take a good look at what's in front of me and think about what I want. I have happiness. Somehow it's not dependant on the outside anymore. But this is not the only direction my life can go in. I see others. I see them right in front of me. I can touch them and feel their breath on my skin. In the long run I have to think of myself. And only myself.

       junctions.    After 4 hours of trying to figure out the ins and outs of the Lineage beta I find a huge headache has come by and said  You don't mind if I stay for a while do you?    So I'm making a quick cd and putting together a journal entry and going to lay in bed in the dark.  Speaking of cd's I have the most amazing one in my possession I've had in years. The thing about the cd's I make is, I make them for other people, and then I make the ones that only I'll like and those I never copy for anybody. These tend to be my favorites-and the ones that affect me the most deeply. So today I had the experience of putting on a cd given to me and finding the very music I always keep to myself. What a gift. It communicates for me where my words cannot find their way.   Beginnings, endings, changes, departures, adjustments. Survival.   As badly as I adpated to change in the past I can't believe now I am starting to feel so comfortable with it.  It's just hard for me to imagine. I feel like I'll never go back to some of the things I've done or been. The only change that still scares me is death, and not really my own. But I imagine even I would adapt to that.  There was a sense of hysteria, of not being able to bear something I'd been given, that I suffered from for so many years. And it's not gone-but it's changed. Some of the worst news this year elicited my most surprising reactions. That sense of not being able to act-gone. I'm not wallowing around anymore in a swamp of indecision. Sometimes it feels good to cut and cut clean.   Something is happening in my heart. I feel the need to write it down, but somehow I know I won't capture it. This music i'm listening to, it's the soundtrack of it. It's funny to find you aren't familiar with something happening to you, then you get handed the score for it. It's as if my heart is pulling open somehow. It's isn't painful. A lot of time it's calm. Then other times I feel like just stopping in my tracks and lying on the ground, wherever I am. I see all these roads, they are devastating, overwhelming, gorgeous and frightning. I want to roll in their dirt, lie next to the footprints. This is the sound of the world, here. This junction. The beautiful thing-not to stand at it for too long.   It's time for new ink-absolutely time.

       today   I sat across from Susan today at the Rue and thought that she was beautiful.and that the deeper our friendship goes the more I realize there is never too much I can put into it. She always challenges me and never judges me. I love you S. thanks for sharing the mint man with me. :)  Every day is good. but when i talk to him it's better. even the most simple conversation is so wonderful, because we're interacting. i've found often the last few years that i'm not particularly concerned about sharing myself with anybody...i seem just as happy writing on my own. no matter how many times a day the phone rings, i still want to keep talking.

       Firstly...    urlLink http://www.gameriot.com   SO going. Eugene? Are you seeing this?  Now that I've gotten my obligatory dorking out of the way...  I keep trying to put my finger on where I am today, and I can't quite get it. It feels like a step *above* depression. My job is fine except sometimes I just want to kick Dean for being the perfectionist obsessive compulsive older brother/super queen that he is. I feel like I've been out too much and I just want some time to lay low. Not to mention, it's getting too goddamn expensive. I could have paid several bills with the 50 dollars I spent on going to see Air. And that brings me to something else I really need to work on...money. Yeah, I used to make a lot more than I do now. Strangely my addled brain does not seem to comprehend this and still seems to think random excessive buying is ok. I don't know what to do with this. I need a plan. Because if I don't get a plan I'm going to need a hiding place when the bill collectors come to hunt me.  Today I felt like I was losing some of myself again. I was driving and I felt like it was slipping. Nothing in particular inspired this. I think I worry the most when these things come out of nowhere. The last few months I've really felt good too, like I had some idea where I was going. I really think a lot of this has to do with my having been single. And now that I've seen this contrast, I like the way I act around men less than ever. There's still a long way to go before I believe in my own self worth. I don't want to blow it now, when I'm just starting to work on it.  There's more. But I think it's going to come out in small bits.

       nooooooo   Air rocked last night. They were totally sexy live. On the other hand somehow I spent 50 dollars. This is not good. I'm not exhausted but I am on the tired side. No dreams. Solid sleep again.  Why do I try to make intresting posts when I have 18 minutes to get dressed for work? I'm thinking my best thoughts probably do NOT come out of this time. If I could just stay in bed today....and sleep and play video games...I would be a happy puppy. Really I would.

       W00000000000000TTTTT   Not only did I sleep.....I overslept!!!! I put a tablecloth over my window to block out the sunlight. Ghetto. Fuck it though. It works. I am no longer suffering from insane sleep deprivation and as a result have gone sailing into the air on a bipolar upswing. Whee!  I remember I always used to have this awful pet peeve with people. When someone would say to me, "stop being so serious", I would have an immediate desire to kick them in the face. But seriously...sometimes it drags me down. I just have to remember sometimes-you can be a depressed wreck, if you choose to, or you can choose to make the best of your day. It always works.  I am stupid hungry. Sushi tonight!

       but hold on. hold on to love.   I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. My first reaction was-how brave are the people that make a film like this. They must be utterly unafraid of how many people (of which you can be assured there will be MANY) will walk out of the theatre saying, "What was that shit?" That kind of courage awes and inspires me. I liked how much the two characters were flawed, kooky and weird.Sometimes in a fun way, sometimes just plain fucking weird. Like people are. Sometimes when it comes to wrapping my mind around my own humanity I don't know where to begin. It leaves me full to capacity and it leaves me speechless. I don't know how people find a way to make films about it, but somehow they do. Wild. Beautiful. Amazing. It hurt a lot to watch. I want to see it again.  The question was posed to me today-How do you trust a person you see doing something wrong to another, right in front of your eyes? I knew Chris cheated, I knew what Chris thought of cheating.So it makes sense that I had the evidence right there, but I chose to ignore.I chose to take a chance instead. And what a chance it was. God those lessons I took away. They are beyond amazing to me every single day.  I have to take chances, sometimes.

       breathe deeply.breathe deeply.   some of the panic is starting to dissolve. i think i might sleep tonight. or i hope i might. it's got to be done right or not at all. i have some things that need my focus. i feel i've had success with some of my bullshit by spending time on my own, and also with the right friends. i want to continue in that direction.  i don't know why i'm writing in here right now. i don't know what i'm talking about, still scattered.

      .......   my heart dropped. out of my chest. i wish i would just fucking die. no wonder i can't sleep. this woman, this person who i would never hurt if she wasn't connected to him. she hates me and she thinks i'm a homewrecker and that i'm instrumental in destroying her life. am i full of shit? talking about this like there isn't another person on the line? her voice.her voice literally ripped a hole in me. being hated makes me want to die. i shouldn't care. and yet i do. empathy eats me completely. i have no defense against her.i have nothing. all i have is this tremendous pain, all i have is the overwhelming fear. is she right? how can i tell her i love her husband and that he loves me? that it's ALWAYS been this way? how can i tell her? i can't fight her. it's not in me.i have no strength, not right now. i can't pull some attitude with her, have some ghetto style black girl fight. in all honesty, hurting this woman makes me want to die, because i know she is a quality person if he has loved her. i know she never deserved to deal with this. god. im sorry. im so sorry, so fucking sorry. i feel like i am going to go out of my mind.

       sleep?anyone?   i can't sleep more than 7 hours. i'm exhausted. i can't catch up.i can't go back to sleep. the sun is shining through the white blinds. i can't make my bed because it means i can't get back in if i do.i have a few small things to do. my guess is that they're not getting done.  jonathan round three started at 10 am.how do you tell a person that you've loved that there was always something more than they could be? that you tried to forget it and it just wouldnt ever go away? this is what i feel guilty for. i was just trying to move forward. it's agonizing to think that  love could be based on my stupid fucking empathy.my need not to be another woman that hurt him. i want to generalize him as an asshole and i can't.he's insanely selfish and even focusing on that can't make it any easier that i am hurting him very badly.and i cant help but think, if i had been a really strong person, i would have never continued to sleep with him even though we had broken up. i feel that's my fault.  meh.

       fear of a dead ignition   I'm so tired that I feel utterly vulnerable and small...not in a good, childlike way, but a bad weak way that sort of defeats me.It has been a hard day. I don't like ending relationships left and right. And maybe I'm not as guiltless as I thought I was(or at least not anymore) but even though I didn't do anything wrong I do feel that somehow I did. Even though I put up with more crap from Jonathan, when he says I didn't try, I actually say to myself -Did I try? Could I have done something more? Why would I care so much about a person that's so selfish? That was a symbiotic relationship. It's funny how for me those are the hardest to let go of-maybe because you're comfortable feeding or being fed on. At least you have a clear description of your role in the game you're playing. I vow never to feel sorry for people, but I think I did feel sorry for him. Because he had trouble relating to people and somehow I was the only one who ever understood and listened. This is a scary role to be in. I don't want to chaperone at your pity party. I remember his fresh young face the day we met. And a part of me wishes we'd never met at all.  Exhaustion is making me doubtful and scared. Past experiences make me doubt the realism of EVERYTHING. The key is in the ignition...but will it turn, or just sit there snug in it's groove? I get scared. I get so fucking scared.

       dammitt   i killed my fucking phone, i even have it plugged in and it will not function whatsoever. i never realized what bullshit battery life it had until i actually tried having daytime conversations;now,they're a part of every day and my phone is bowing under the pressure like Atlas. can you say upgrade?  even with quite a bit to drink in my system, i realize what's selfish, and i realize that includes picking up the phone at this hour and calling anyone, which i couldn't even if i wanted to, and i want to, but my phone is total complete fucking crap and hates me and has zero concern over whether or not i ought ot be able to make proper phone calls.  Susan I love you, and im so glad you came with us tonight. Josh I love you, and i'm so thrilled to see you happy. Ryan I love you and I am happier you are here than i could ever explain.  and if i had been able to call, what would i say? my soul is pared down to it's most simple. half the night i stared at a girl that danced a little bit like you, and i thought of you, and i loved you with something that is so huge that i can't begin to understand it, yet. it's not what it was when i was a girl-dare i say that that was actually  weak  in comparison to this? it really was. somehow it was. i know i'm rambling and everyone is probably sick of hearing it and i can't care. tired of censoring and of using generalizations. my life is great, it's amazing. and on top of all that, there's you, you, you.

       finally.   I'm not at work. Lately I just don't want to be at work. Which is clearly, painfuly obvious.Dean gave me a talking to today about my not paying attention. It's the same thing that fucked me up at my last job except now it's worse, because then I had petty unimportant bullshit on my mind and now I have something of essential importance on my mind. I'm looking forward to sunday, having an entire uninterrupted day off to myself. I'm looking forward to tonight so I can get wasted beyond oblivion. I was told when I walked in the door at Josh's that 735 has changed management and that tonight will be their last 80's night. I just feel bad, although I can't really justify feeling so down over losing a night out. But considering it's the one thng I really love going out to do...I don't know. It is April Fool's Day. I hope it's just a big joke.  I miss you. I miss you at every day and every moment. I'm starting to think about these tiny things. Finding out what you like. Surprising you. Reading to you at night. Doing something you ask of me. Anything.My mind keeps going back to specific moments-as always.  You called.Is it insane to love, adore, the simplest conversations? Could we talk about buying shoes and I'd be delighted? (ok-that's a bad example.) Let's talk about movies. Video Games.Calvin and Hobbes. Going shopping.Whatever wherever whenever. I'm just starting to learn to tell you. I thought I was little miss communicator. Maybe i haven't even started to learn your language. I thought it was unspoken. That must be how I fucked up. Assuming you knew, just because when I looked at you, it was that look.  I'm not disappointed. I know there is a lot that's unspoken and always will be. But there's joy in the telling. So much joy.  "Will you forgive me if I rush  when I tell you I am yours?"  -Peter Murphy

       awesum   I'm a little tired but feeling good. Therapy today made me realize...Ive come a lot further than I thought. The last time I sat with my therapist, I was a shaky emotional wreck, fighting through a relationship with Jonathan and trying to understand what was wrong with ME that didn't make me good enough for him. This time I sat there, able to voice to her in detail my personal concerns, but finding the biggest thing I had to deal with was letting go of who I was...and starting to grasp who I am now. It felt good to KNOW. I realized how much I like my job and how grateful I am for it. I realized my personal life is exactly where it should be. I realized that I'm never going to let myself be treated the way I once did. If the last person I loved had any lasting impression on my life, it was that he was the signature asshole of them all. You got your wish-I am less trusting. Of people like you.  Yesterday was great. Angel and I hung out and did NOTHING. We watched movies and anime and played games. Long, long conversations that never seem to end, only taper off and then pick back up later. He's shit for my bank account though. Every freakin day he goes, "Have you heard of this? Have you seen this? You gotta play this. Bleh, bleh.." Yes, I bitch. But it's good stuff. All of it. Every single bit.  I talked to Josh last night. You know I hear your voice, and I forget that you're on the other side of the US? Come back and make us peppermint milkshakes,or even better, mimosas, so we can get drunk in bed again. And I miss Ryan's laugh. And I miss laughing at people hysterically in the wrongest times. I love you so much it fills my throat tight and I have to try to breathe around it. And then I remember American Beauty and it's ok. Contrary to some people's beliefs...there's no such thing as too many "American Beauty" moments. There is such a thing as too few though, and my life is blessed with the opposite of that.  Happy Birthday from Christian. A perfect white embroidered parasol. Still the classiest person I know. Thank you.  Goddamn I'm happy today.

       jesus.   I was just getting up and thinking about how wonderful last night was when I opened the front door and found this package. Why would you do this? Why would you buy me anything or write me a fucking WORD? Don't remember my birthday, don't remember my things, and for God's fucking sake forget I existed. Forget anything that ever happened. Maybe it's immature...but it's the only way I can deal with it. You, as always, bounce back as usual with no cares in the world.

      My computer's acting like shit. I tried to do scans and it freezes. Meh.  I went to sleep thinking, no nightmares, ok? I even read Harry Potter for hours to try to keep my mind feeling cheerful and british.Instead I dreamt about calling Dean to tell him I'd be late for work and then never going in at all. There was a huge rainstorm that turned the sky utterly black.I left my car at home and rode a low bicycle with huge sloping handlebars which I had to sit low on. I rode out uptown. I was at the house of two gay men who were friends. It was an enormous house with ground elevators. Then I came back upstairs and for some reason the two men and I started to have some sort of orgy. Then Susan was there and she said, "This is disgusting. I can't handle this." I got up and got on the bicycle and rode home. In place of my house there was some new house which my mother was responsible for designing, very modern with long lines. I went into my new bedroom (with some sort of shiny material covering the walls in the shape of moons) and laid in my bed listening to my voice mails. Someone left me a message telling me he had changed his mind about our being together ( I suppose this person was a boyfriend, but I did not recognize his voice). I laid there feeling a familiar disappointment.  Been down for a few days. Hope I come back up soon.

       the temple's doorway   fucking stupid, fucking stupid, stupid, stupid stupid stupid.  I have to conquer this. This will not take over my life and ruin everything that comes into it. What is it I am trying to find?  I saw my old therapist while I was at the grocery. Strange...She and I are going to speak tomorrow. I hope to see her this week.  I need silence, quiet, inner time. I need to stop running, even if it doesnt seem like running. I need focus. I think it's time for me to step away for a while.  I sat at a red light on Poydras yesterday and watched Jonathan at work. He didn't see me. I was overwhelmed with sadness. I know he's parasitic and that I've done the right thing. So why then does it still hurt me, even though I've made a choice for my own self preservation?  The night before last I dreamt of dogs devouring their young.

      Angel and I played Magic this afternoon. When he got the cards out and I started reading through everything, all those new cards and all, I was sure that I was going to be as hopelessly beaten as I had been at Mario Kart an hour previously. I was thinking, wow, I remember this, I remember that. By game two I had a win...yes, it's dorky, but exciting nevertheless. And now I'm digging through my card library and thinking about decks to make. Damn you Angel. You're an addiction activator.  I picked up Eric at 3. I got to see Morgan and Misha! I didnt think Morgan would remember who I was. At first she didn't seem to acknowledge me. And I said her name and then, she crawled up my lap, and started to kiss me. Then she laid on the carpet and let me pet her belly. I sort of felt like crying. I love that dog very much. It was good to see her again.  We went and saw Troy. It was amazing. I was excited to see Wolfgang Petersen is still doing amazing projects. It occured to me during the film that I had never read The Iliad...I guess I missed out on that part of high school. I'm still so inspired by cinematography. lighting, angles. Captured moments. Perhaps as I start to write again, I can capture some of my own.  Drove home with the windows rolled down, listening to one of my 80's cd's and singing. Felt really good.

       moshi moshi?   an evening of decadence including an AMAZING chicken enchilada fabulousness created by James and Francois, wine, three different kinds of ice cream, and watching Battle Royale. AND getting my awesome birthday present from Fran. I'm uttely content and borderline sick. Nothing quite like indulgence to the point where you cant breathe. I love my friends.  I got some things cleared up today that were weighing on me. But I'm also exhausted. I'm glad tomorrow's thursday, the week is dragging.

      what the fuck happened. i dont know. i dont understand. i cant help thinking that this is another casualty of my problems, my issues, and for that I feel a frustration that's indescribable. I question my judgement. Where is my intuition that I thought worked so cleanly? From experience I always thought that one had to become deeply entertwined into another person's life before certain types of issues could emerge. Is that ever fucking wrong.  I know I have been selfish before, terribly selfish. But I've also been self sacrificial. And when someone tells me they are going through something, I drop my own role in it. I let go. I try to help them however I can. I forget myself, even if it hurts somehow.  dammitt.

       you were there again.  It's been a while since I dreamt about him. I was at some event. He was sitting on the stairs on the phone. Funny enough he had cut his hair like Angel's, close on the sides and spiky on top.I was on the phone as well, thankfully I thought, so I tried to go up the stairs around him. He reached out and grabbed my leg to stop me. The conversations blurs here. He introduces me to his girlfriend, who is a slight asian girl with a nice smile. "You're dating asian girls now?" I said. We laugh over this. There's a lot of conversation. All that's really clear in it is, I'm not angry anymore. Ive let go of it in favor of forgiveness. It feels close again, as it did when we were friends. I remember us getting along. And I'm letting it all go. Dreams of peace. Such beautiful dreams. I miss you, and I think I'm about to forget you a little. I really loved you. Some part of me always will. I think of you laughing and still, feel a tremendous emotion that reached deeply into who I was. But something tells me this is a little bit of letting it all go.

      Feeling sorry for yourself and feeling selfish. I dread these things. They truly eat people up. It's unreal. I do want to preserve myself to the best of my ability. But, I also want, as much as possible, to think of other people as considerately and compassionately as possible, avoid selfishness, and cultivate understanding. To respect each individual's path. And think of what they go through... instead of thinking of myself. Not to hate those who do wrong to me, but let that go. I've been carrying things I should have let go of, anyway. And what a freedom it is- not to fight against life...but to move along within it!

       Holy Crap Wow   I get to work and get a most amazing message. One of our clients went to New York for the weekend and took the bag she bought here to a wedding. And now Candace Bushnell, the creator of Sex in the City, wants to buy one. And another designer wants us to come to New York and have a trunk show.ASAP. Holy crap wow. I think some majorly wild shit is about to happen and all I can say is...I'm excited to be involved. Finally I'm going to see New York this year!  I called to try to make an appointment with the therapist this morning. She is out of the office doing a training until next monday which gives me a week to map out the things I want to work on with her. They're pretty clear so far, however, I want to get them on paper,have a physical representation. I woke up this morning carrying some sadness and a tremendous amount of unsurety. Also there is a calm and a sense of stability in knowing I am about to attack these long running issues and get results. It relieves me to know what's going on with me is not going to hurt anyone else right now, and some loneliness is a small price to pay for that.  Maybe, by some strange fluke, i'll go to New York and Angelina Jolie will mysteriously show up at our trunk show, start chatting with me and find herself desperately shoving me into the bathroom to have passionate, insane sex. Heh.

      I'm at home. I just cleaned my room. I'm in my pajamas and I have no obligations until 10 am tomorrow morning. And I am very happy.  Some answers are starting to come, that are easing the pressure, making me understand where it was all coming from. There's a ways to go yet, but I think in the end it will pay off. At least I can see where I'm going. I feel like I have some measure of control again.  I miss Josh Hallmark. I saw a big fat black chick last night going out with her sistas, with a huge white fringey shirt on, colored stretch pants and big white pointy toed high heeled boots with bows on em, and I thought, this is the kind of shit that makes J and I shit ourselves in a way so simultaneous it's scary.  sigh.

      Something has me thinking about issues of control and power. The issues of how people act, what causes them to experience jealousy and show possessiveness, etc. I think back to myself first. I have experienced it to a point where it hurt me so badly I felt as if I couldn't breathe. The frustrating thing is, I have had a clear understanding of the human need to discover new things and people for a long time, ascertained by directly studying my own. Knowing this, and therefore understanding the politics of jealousy, there should be no reason for it to ever occur to me. Of course logic and emotion rarely intersect. I feel for years I have sacrificed my independance and ability to know myself as a person to relationships in which I was desperately trying to somehow earn the other person's approval. What happened to me with Mike was of course the worst, and having had no experience in relationships, I went back to the approach I always take, which is to look at myself and say,  Am I doing something wrong? Could I be doing something better?  I had no idea that this was a pattern which I would eventually be choked by. With Jonathan I had no excuse. I did what was comfortable-which was to put up with vast amounts of bullshit that would tear my self dignity directly out of my spirit. And Chris the same. I simply thought because it seemed different, it would be. Eventually that became a complete waste of time. Deep within I hold a fury of frustration that I allowed these things to happen to me. And I will not let them happen again.

      It's raining again.Don't have time for a real post again. Just the pieces of dreams left over. Josh and I in an elevator shaped like an eggcup. When we get to our floor it promptly turns upside down and dumps us on the floor. We lay there laughing hysterically. There's some huge open air market type of place. I wander through avoiding salespeople. There was so much more, but it's lost already. Fuck.

       Saturn Returns   Yesterday was simply a remarkable day. I don't think a birthday has been so great since I was back in the single digit ages. I woke up to a pedicure from mom and a bucket of money from grandma and aunt, erasing those financial freak outs of last week to a distant memory. Even unexpected phone calls from friends I didn't expect to remember the day. For me it's always a day when I feel real friends step forward or fall behind.  At 11 am I was carted off to an amazing 2 hour massage, a surprise from my mother. The therapist surprised me not only by being incredibly good at her craft, but offering desperately needed wisdom about the path I am on. She explained to me the time period called Saturn Returns, which is between 27 and 29 years, when you prepare to become thirty years old. The change in perspective-from thinking of myself as not having done enough in the proper time, to just beginning my life-was profoundly impactful. I was enchanted with her lovely home and loved the experience. Lying on the massage table listening to the powerful thunder was something I won't soon forget.  Afterwards my mom and I walked in the rain and bought bags of goodies from Whole Foods. We drove home to meet Jason for part two of the day. He greeted me with his beautiful smile and an armful of roses. After a shower we headed to Wasabi and had my favorite sushi rolls in the world and then we went to Lakeside Pets to hold a puppy. We played with a perfect little West Highland that looked just like Morgan's pups, same adorable disposition. After getting the puppy fix we went wandering in Toys R Us being big kids and oogling video games. We had green tea at home and played old nes games.  Of course I thought about birthdays past and people past. I think it's all a part of me letting go of another life. It's funny, because it's so much better now, but I still feel constantly lost and trying to grasp onto something. Even if the way things were used to hurt you, you recognize it, it's familiar. It hurts me that these patterns have been a part of my life for such a long time that when I finally get away from them, I don't know what to do. At the same time, I see myself finally shying away from situations that are going to drain me. It's going to be a long road until I can let it all go, but I'm ok with that. I need to develop my patience anyway.  Back to work...

       what is.   Something made me cry with joy. There's been a lot of tears lately, shed for all kinds of reasons. But it's been a while since I cried with joy. I thought about it. I thought. What inspired me was the sight of what I considered to be two people genuinely finding themselves in love. I always come here to wax and wane about what love is, what it isn't, even grilling myself to the coals asking myself if anything I've ever experienced has been it. It's all been it, of course-in many different forms. I truly believe the mistake people make is holding their breath waiting for "it"-when it's happening all around them every day. Every level. Every form. Some of it is better than other forms. Rapture and newness overwhelm, chemistry twists your logic. Anything can happen. Then you factor in how the different baggage and complexes people carry intertwine and what is created...it seems very complex. And perhaps it is. But when you stand still and what lies before you is calm like a still ocean...isn't that what people really mean when they say,  I knew?  Not because of love at first sight, butterflies, dinners or spent money...but because of trust, communication, honesty and kinship? Sure, it's found between people. But it requires effort to grow strong.  It's hard to be objective about it. After all, it's feelings that I'm talking about and people get involved. Disappointed. Betrayed. I have done all those things to other people. It seems to me that more than you make a promise to another person you choose to be with, you make a promise to yourself. I have always struggled badly with this. I have wanted to do right with the wrong people. I have acted childishly with my emotions and actions. I have been selfish and let my desires run rampant. It was fun and it was miserable. And I want to leave it behind me. I know I'll need help to get there. I know I haven't done anything that has required as much strength as this.   My goal is to find the inner center that I have so often missed. And I will not stop until I answer my own questions and transform myself. I want to be pure.

       Pivot   Somewhere today amidst restless sleep there was a point where everything shifted. I don't know what. I wish I could begin to describe it. I don't even know that I was conscious at the time. I only know that for me clarification lies in some very odd places. For me to understand what loving something is, I have to understand what losing it would be. Last night I compared my old life with what could be my new life. Or rather...I stood in my old life and looked around. I found myself unhappy and empty. The silence of dawn met me with candor. The space where my car had been stood silent. I walked down the street aware of the sky shading through lighter and lighter shades of black and I truly felt the weight of  being.  I longed to pull my skin off and be nothingness. Was it then that the shifting began? Was it when I sat near Josh's old apartment on the curb and listened to the city's silence? I have no idea. I came home and wrote check after check. The concept of money crushed me. The meaningless details of life did the same. I had the distinct desire to cast off anything that made my appearance different in any way(makeup,clothing ,perfume,etc) and lay naked in an empty place. Nothing but being. To lay my head in a stream and feel the water moving around me. It was all I could think of wanting. I woke up after it was dark and drove uptown. I walked into his house and looked at him sitting in the big black chair. It made me almost mute. I felt as if I was returning from some long voyage and would never be able to begin to communicate all that had transpired. Yet, what I didn't know before, I now knew. I had to hope that somehow I could impart it with something other than words. Somehow some of it came out, and with it a pain I didn't know I carried. He recieved it as he recieves everything. With calm and compassion and love. Part of me wants to sleep, and part of me wishes I could write all night, and see the sun rise again.

       zero   I have a clear desire today to cease life. No more social events, phone calls, appointments, interactions, explanations, payments made,justification, contemplating your catalog of mistakes. I know life is good. I know beautiful things can and do happen. Many have happened to me. Of course I'm not planning action on this. I'm simply coming here to express my feeling, directly. I am overwhelmed by money and by many failures. Every living moment is a chance to do better. I know. This will pass and I'll be fine. I have to come up with a plan. But not right now.

       a heart like a resounding drum   Everything's under a microscope. I didn't choose this. All I know is that I need a deeper level of understanding of myself than I've previously ever had. And it's going to take me a little while to get to that. I had a long period of calm. I saw it,I understood it, it was familiar to me. I was learning it. It amazed me that chaos was something I had chosen. And that if I so desired...I could choose something else. I've been struggling with loving. Who I've loved. Who I haven't. Who I've deluded myself over. What is  loving ? Is it the thrill of fireworks. or the calm of silence? What's the definitive answer to what love is? For me, there is no answer. It's subjective. I can compare myself to any psychological profile or list of studies and results. We are all different no matter how many recognizable patterns are found. I can't define my experiences based on anybody else's. Which means, the definition of love in Colette's world is up to me. In that world, there's no such thing as The One. Rather, I see an infinite number of variable equations with people who could be good for me and I for them in many different ways. Because I do see things this way, my chosen goal is: to honor and respect the person I do choose to the utmost, therefore honoring myself. But also-to never lose my sense of reality-which is directly linked to not living in a fantasy world where people pair off in perfect, unquestionably fated duos. I'm not trying to be a cynic, I swear. It's just the way I genuinely percieve it. Which leads me up to now. I feel a veil lying over my heart. I'm trying to kick through all that has happened, burn it away, get to the place inside that I've always possessed that seemed to fly straight from my gut like a precise knife-that place of total knowing. But lately there is no knowing. It's scary to usually have understanding and then suddenly all that is wiped away. I don't know how to grapple with this new terrain...and I can't relax about it. I'm not familiar with these safety precautions. I've never given a fuck about safety. Only my instinct. That instinct was my core which I implicitly trusted and acted from passionately and directly. I miss it. I'm sure caution is a healthier approach. But I miss it anyway.  To be continued...

       8:20 a.m.   I've been strangely wordless these last few days. It seems that simplicity stupifies me into silence. It would, I guess. I'm far from used to it.  It freaks me out that I could have been so conditioned to chaos in relationships that I could have actually adapted to the conditions it presents. That in encountering something that works without struggle, I have the skills of a prehistoric man. I always hoped that I adapted well to whatever situation I was presented with. I still don't  know.  As something is forming I cannot be sure of it yet...I keep trying to grasp it as it changes. I need to stop grasping. Who could have dreamt it would be such a challenge to not struggle for meaning. Analysis gets fucking old sometimes.  I miss flickers of moments more deeply than I have words for. The way we could look at some people and think the exact same thing. The way you randomly wore scarves when it was 80 degrees outside. Your beautiful hands. Miss you so much.

       The thin skin on the back of her hands   Last night my grandmother had a panic attack. My mom was asleep, but I heard her so I went in to see what I could do. As usual my feelings of irritation were present. I did what I could to help her, and afterwards we sat and talked for a long time. I never realized how lonely she was. It was much worse than I thought, or bothered to notice. Unfortunately it's her fault she is, as she chose never to liberate herself in life or learn to drive. Now I find myself looking at the situation, seeking where I should draw the line. I know a big part of all this is the guilt and the pressure that a codependant person lays on you. But also there's some true things there, too.  She was the parent that raised me when my mother was unavaliable-which was often. Now the tables are turned. She's needy, neurotic and a complete overaxious mess. Wrapped within all that is a golden heart and amazing spirit full of love. And it really angers me that all I can see is what annoys me about her. I know she hasn't had a happy life. And now in the latest stages of it, what can I do to make it different for her somehow? It isn't my responsibility, but she doesn't have the life skills to do it for herself. Not to mention, can I let go of my own selfishness enough to be present for her-not only when she needs me-but just in general, when she wants me?  altruism-harder than it looks.

       diatribe approaching.   Two people in the last 24 hours have been selfish self centered fucking losers to me. And here's what I have to say about that.  *pauses a moment because massive grin is spreading across face*  I am so done with you useless self obsessed pieces of complete shit.I don't have a scrap of empathy for you or your poor life or your poor feelings. All I know is, you take your shit out on me and you become my enemy in a single instant. Perhaps all the bullshit I've swallowed has suddenly reversed and come back up, and I'm vomiting mad nazi propaganda. Do you know how it makes you look, when all you can think about is yourself? If life's that bad and oh poor poor you....why don't you hurl yourself into oncoming traffic? Or, perhaps you're the type who's always right and so anal everything has to be perfect and your only sick pleasure in life is correcting everyone around you. Or taking out all your frustrations on the nearest person to you. Newsfuckingflash:You're still MISERABLE any way you look at it. Maybe you're perfect, and I'm not. But I'm HAPPY-and I'm damn sure you aren't. So go reorganize some fucking paperwork or something. You might want to dislodge that huge stick that's jammed up your asshole while you're at it.  I sound really pissed but I'm not, I'm actually laughing my ass off. When a person's in a bad place, I'm the first person to feel empathy;but when someone's self inflicting it and then dares to feel sorry for themselves, I'll be the first one to point and laugh my ass off. And if that's mean, I don't give a shit whatsoever.  I listened to your mix cd tonight Josh. And I miss you like hell.

       drive through, please   My life is extremely happy. There is a tremendous amount of joy. And yet for the past 48 hours it's been eating at me. Angry. Can't stand re-examining all the things that happened, and finally seeing the answers. It's like being duped hundreds of times in one hour. The compact, fast food version of betrayal.  I think about everything I did. And I know I did a bunch of shit things. They're no less bad because I did them out of hurt and pain. I knew they were wrong things and I wanted to do differently. I've done differently and it feels good, better than good. So what's it like to be a person who elaborately lies and decieves all people around them, with no concern for anything other than themselves? I can't reason it out. it's not meant to be reasoned. But because I analyze everything, I can't help myself. I keep trying to do the mature thing and let it go. For the time being though...I'm still feeling kind of stabbity.  I have zero desire to work this week. I'm really feeling a need for focus.

       and this just in...people still fucking suck. please tune in at 10!   Just found out some unsurprising information about the past pseudo-joke relationship I was in-that in fact I was cheated in for the whole duration of it, not just the four months I originally thought. This doesn't upset me so much about the person-I know without a doubt that he was and is a worthless piece of shit.However...it doubles my own emotions about what I allowed myself to go through. I know I need those memories to fortify my future and who I have become. But right now I'd give anything to erase them completely-to forget I was ever so disrespected by any man who claimed to love me. In a long conversation with Susan it really occurred to me that MOST people are selfish liars by nature-people who act like actual human beings are the exception. I honestly can't imagine re-entering the dating field-the idea of having through that crap again is too much for me. I want to stay just where I am.  In the long run, I feel I've found my own award. Karma is doing it's thing around me, from what I hear,and funny enough it always seems to pop up. I knew I had to change my life, and I did. And I was given a reward beyond anything I might have dreamed-my confidence and belief in myself returned. I thought it couldn't get any better than that. And then, it did.  Every day I have to say goodbye to things again. I held emotional infection and disease for so long, it was a huge part of me. For the people who fed it and helped it to fester, I think of them too. I'm pushing hard to get to that day where I'm not angry at them anymore.

      Met some more really cool people out last night. Lately I find that when I'm meeting new people there's a lot of happiness and warmth emanating from me. I wish I could describe it a little better than that, but it's just all I've got. It's a great feeling.  On the homefront I am having a hard time. Maybe 3 days home in a row, stranded in bed, had something to do with this. I don't know. My ability to get along with my grandmother seems to be waning. She's someone I love very much but will never be able to relate to. I want to be pliable on this topic, not hard. But hard is all I've been. She irritates me to no end. Everything about her is negative. I want to respond with love and not irritability, but how? Something I have to do within myself.   Josh. Ryan. I'm worried.

       Bad dreams and Magician lust   After one of the most wonderful days in my recent memory, I go to sleep and dream of betrayal and losing everything.  This is getting so old. I'm ready to take joy for joy. I don't want to try to read into everything. There is no alternate fucking story. Happiness is happiness. I don't want to be haunted when I go to sleep by dreams of the worst fears I have. And frankly the last therapy session I discussed this in I got zero help from my therapist. Which leaves it up to me.  In other news, I think I have a crush on Harry Potter. Here is why that is scary.     I'm a fucking pedophile.  On the other hand, there's this:     ..in which you can actually see the very cute boy developing. Who I might like to make out with if given the chance.  I am officially pathetic.

       logical progression   When will my ability to trust return? It's hard to realize how shattered it was, until it's tested again in a situation that matters. And I'm disappointed in myself, that I haven't begun to recover at least a little from the things that have made me this way. Am I being too hard on myself? In my heart I believe that every time I give in to distrust, to pettiness, to jealousy, that the person who instilled in me those emotions of fear has power over me once again. And considering how long I gave each of those respective people power over me, I don't think they deserve a moment more. Zen appeals to me in that it defines the nature of  flow . It is our human nature that causes us to cling, to scrabble uselessly for control. It's so much gentler to simply let go. In my logical mind, all this is so simple. Then emotions hit....and I have to struggle to hold on to a sense of peace. I hate that humans are made this way. To cultivate peace, I have to practice it.

      Lately I've been tired, tired, tired. Everything's ok though. More than ok. Good.  The Saturn Returns thing that I found out about on my birthday is really starting to drum up a lot of evidence towards it's proof of existance. Month after month of chaos, and then suddenly things neatly fall into place. The shift is so extreme, sometimes I just feel like plopping down on the ground and just staring around me for a while. Things that seemed so diffucult a year ago, now seem easy. I'm not scared about the school thing anymore. I wonder how much effect the relationships I tied myself into had on my self esteem. I always felt like I couldn't do certain things or that I would fail before. And now I feel fine. Even trying feels good. If I did fail I'd feel at least that I tried. But I'm not expecting to fail. The idea of mentally challenging myself really excites me, and I hope it starts to pave the direction that I dream about finding.  The further behind me my past gets, the happier I seem to be. I feel so much cleaner emotionally. I'm looking back at certain times and finding myself amazed that I was involved. And I'm getting used to what it's like to deal with no bullshit VERY quickly.  With one exception of a family disagreement, I haven't been *truly* annoyed in about a month. I hope someone's taping this.  Eighties night is sorely missed. It died about the same time Josh left, give or take a week. And somehow this doesn't surprise me.  More, but not now.

       woo   i'm really tired for some reason. i came home to a pile of mail, and while i was stressing over how i was going to pay my colossal phone bill, i suddenly found myself with a new credit card in my hands. hellooooo, $3000 credit limit. now that is some scary fucking shit. on the other hand, i think i'm going to pay the phone bill with it and then bury it in the backyard. Wrapped in a piece of meat so my dog will chew my hand off if i try to take it back.  i'm excited about being registered for school. about DOING something. about maybe being something, something more. about being creative again, having a reason to be. i sketched last night and was satisfied with the results.  i spend most of every day floating somewhere between absolute joy and semi-shocked disbelief.hard feelings are dissolving, because the situations they happened within have been eclipsed without a trace.i'm starting to wonder-has this ever really happened to me before? or is this genuinely, completely new?

       imprinting   and now, at one of the most amazing points in my life, i find letting go becomes more important than ever. also, it's more stupidly diffucult for me to do than ever before. perhaps i am simply a person that holds on to everything. but i don't believe in wallowing anymore-i don't let myself do it. so what then, is this? perhaps just the imprint life leaves in your skin.  last night i made the aquaintance of two fascinating new people. angel and i went to the dervish and met Wesley, who brought a friend, Hai.  hours of conversation-about every dweeby otaku thing a person could imagine. and to think that at one time, i worried about finding other people who liked all the same things i liked.  later in the evening Angel introduced me to Yael. beautiful-immediately her energy hit me. weird how that can happen-like beyond the pleasantries of meeting new people, your essence can just reach out. she actually reminded me of a woman i loved very much a few years ago. she's in a familiar place-leaving a long abusive relationship. i directly connect to this and admire her strength-obviously she's evolving. i will always be touched by that in other people. we're having dinner tuesday evening-looking forward to it.  musically-getting hit hard by a couple of artists. Josh Groban-yes, he's pop, and i don't care. his voice is going straight into my heart, and making me remember how much i love to sing. i still think about how my life would have been if i had chosen to pursue a career with my voice. there's something about singing that gives me great joy, so tremendous i don't feel i can contain it in my body sometimes. Alanis Morrissette-i always hear her, and what she says goes into a dimension past people's basic bullshit. and i love her.  the only thing wrong is money. but that's as usual. i'm going to fix it, somehow. i swear i will. it's too tiny a chain to hold me, when so much else is raising me up.  my heart is light.

      There's a car parked across the street, I parked my car and looked at it a while. I'm happy it's there. It's empty, for now. But I just like looking at it.

       inner chewings   There's always a point, a voice in my head, that fights me when I need to be reasonable, to preserve myself and my energy, to stop moving. I'll go to any lengths in specific types of circumstances. It seems like a long chase for something I don't quite understand. I don't like it-it's like my sense of self preservation is unsteady. I've come a long way in the sense that I'm never going to take the same things from people that I once did, and I feel good about that. I guess the next thing is obviously to address myself and the things I'll do to myself, for reasons I don't yet understand. Saying no to selfish fuckers is easy, but saying no to myself seems to be much harder.  The other outstanding issue seems to be financial. There's some connection between my money spending and my emotions. I know I spend money when I don't need anything, or worse; I'll have the urge to spend it and need to find something to spend it on. Some little impulse within me tells me to cut all this away, all of it.  I'm exhausted. I need to be quiet for a little while.

      lately this thing's been happening-i get off work(and mind you, most days i sit at my desk a large portion of the day, not an extremely strenuous activity), go home, do a few things around the house, and then settle down to either read or watch a movie. And before 9 pm, i'm sound fucking asleep. ten hours plus. it happens once about every other week. and it's freaky. i know i had been tired the last few days, but in a way it kind of sucks. i have little free time as it is, and then to spend it sleeping seems just kind of wrong somehow. i had weird dreams again but don't remember a single one.  i'm going to San Francisco on the 19th. it's hard to swallow. i always have a hard time grasping that i'm going somewhere until i'm actually on the plane. travel is magical for me. i always feel that type of movement is a time where the soul is suspended, away from all the familiar, and there's so much room for the absorption of one's entire timeline. i'm going to miss my first saturday class, and i wish i wasn't. but i'm going to be with one of my best friends, and i can't wait.  two twelve hour days, coming right up! whee!

        magnificence     so much happened today, and i thought about it all in the car on the way home from the concert, and i wish i could find a cohesive way to put it all into words here.  today i ate lunch with ken, who i work with. he lost a partner 3 years ago to HIV. i've known about this for a while but we have never discussed it. i got the oppurtunity to do so today. never have i been so impressed by a person's victory over odds than his in the situation. people can have a variety of responses to tremendous loss, but his was unlike any i've ever seen. the only way i can describe it is a calm acceptance that that event, like all others, was a part of the path of life. i was affected by his good nature and his peacefulness. it made me think about the things that i've been unable to let go, which are so much lesser than death.    this experience alone would have been plenty for the day, but then i got the oppurtunity to go see Sarah McLachlan perform, which I had desperately wanted to do anyway but kept telling myself I couldn't afford. since i was resigned to not going, the surprise of being called and offered a free ticket was overwhelmingly wonderful.  once i saw her,  i could not believe i considered  not  seeing her. as attached as i have always been to her lyrics, seeing her person added another dimension. she radiated a tremendous  joy  which   totally amazed me. i've never seen a performer like her. as she sang, i listened to the words i've heard hundreds of times before, and they seemed to connect with what i had been thinking earlier-pushing past your fears and grasping life, complete, knowing you can endure and still be whole at the end, moving along with the rhythm, the flow of this experience of being human.  what magnificence it was, to feel that type of energy flowing freely through your own.   sometimes i feel so lucky.

       mondays must be made illegal    &nbsp; if i could find a way to hold some sort of campaign wiping mondays off the face of the planet i think i would. my stomach, for one, is already rebelling 100 percent and refuses to operate. luckily for me my boss ken is exactly the same way i am on monday, so it's cool.  a lot less time in the office this week-we have a big event thursday and then another in Mobile, Alabama on saturday. road trip. i like my job. plus i just found out i can work another door so i'm getting extra money this week again. going to bills, but i'm ok with that.  i need a nap. at 10 am.

       and on and on and on     i touched a moment tonight that threw me back in time 10 years.  in a club tonight i heard Orbital's "Halcyon+on+on".  i remembered being 17. running into the Dome Room in Chicago.  the most amazing place i'd seen to date. i looked up into the ceiling and saw the painted face of God.  no, i'm not kidding....the floors spiralled up. people dancing everywhere.  an abundance of amazing energy-and that song came on.  i get upset that my mind blurs details. but at least the body of the memory was strong enough to last. all i remember about being 17 was that it was so easy to have fun. and also, a sense of being a clean slate, unmarked by any extreme experiences.  utterly unafraid because things like betrayal and desertion hadn't happened yet. i miss courage. i struggle for it.    still dissolute.

      courtesy of josh @  urlLink http://oystershell.blogspot.com   100 things.  1.i think i have a problem with men. 2.or rather, i think that i did when i dated strictly losers. 3. it's hard for me to believe anyone thinks I am dynamic. 4. i don't feel dynamic. 5. i do, however, feel lazy. 6. i'm very close to my mother. 7. i generally hate strangers until proven otherwise. 8. this is because i think most people are fucking stupid. 9. i am very overemotional, although less so than i used to be. 10. i can't return a phone call for shit. 11. my conversations with my friends mostly consist of video games and&nbsp;raunchy sex. 12. this makes me sound like a 17 year old boy instead of a 27 year old woman. 13. i'm addicted to EBay. 14. i'm addicted to money spending in general. 15. i often find myself looking for a reason to spend money. 16. if one more person tells me i'm too deep or too much, i'm beating their fucking asses. 17. my image of what i wish i looked like and what i actually look like are completely different. 18. since about age 6 i've wished i had long, wavy "princess" hair. 19. i think my best features are my skin and my eyes. 20. i used to hate my hands, but now they don't bother me as much. 21.i wear stuff now that you couldn't have caught me dead in 10 years ago. 22. i have really wide feet. 23. which doesn't seem to stop me from finding shoes somehow. 24. i own about 50 pairs of shoes, most of which i've only worn once. 25. i spend less time analyzing things than i used to. 26. i do wish i could be a little more laid back. 27. when people tell me they think im intelligent, i don't really know why they think that. 28. i think i'm smart,but then i also feel stupid just as often. 29. most of the time i like the inside of my head. 30. i do harbor a fear of failing, since i've failed a lot before. 31. i'm compassionate, but somehow still enjoy making fun of people. 32. i want to be successful at whatever work i do. 33. i want to fall in love with an occupation. 34. and i want to know what that occupation is before i turn 30. 35. i am more addicted to video games than i could ever explain. 36.they got me through one of the hardest times of my life. 37.the stories in these games invited me in, and i became a part of them in a way that made me feel wanted.  38. that's one of my most important childhood memories. 39. as a child, i remember very little. 40. i remember that i was spoiled. 41. i like my current job more than any job i've ever had. 42. i see a lot of paths i could take in the work world, but so far none has quite fit me like i wanted. 43. all i want out of life is the experience, and nothing more.  44. i love strawberries. 45. i hate tomatoes, 46. but love ketchup, salsa, and tomato sauce. 47. this makes no sense to me. 48. i rarely drink anymore, but when i do it's with the intention of getting completely shitfaced. 49. last week i learned the word googly-woogly, which means to get shitfaced. 50. i like this word better than any of the other terms for drunk because it's silly and i like silly things.  51. i weigh way more than i want to. 52. this is because i refuse to fucking diet. 53. i think fast food is disgusting when i don't eat it for a while. 54. i'm often impatient while driving. 55. i think the most while i am in my car. 56. i wish i could stop thinking about people that are no longer a part of my life. 57. at the same time, i'm proud of myself for getting rid of them. 58. my favorite piece of furniture in my room is my bed. 59. when i get in my bed i feel total relaxation and comfort. 60. i love my bedroom. 61. i often find myself wanting to spend a lot of time there. 62. i love to lay on my bed reading and then eventually fall asleep. 63. i have a crush on Harry Potter. 64. this is slightly humiliating for me since in real life, he's still only 16 years old. 65. if i had to compare myself to any fictional character,i can't really think of who might fit. 66. if i could be any fictional character i wanted, it would probably be Scully from the X Files. 67. i just like strong women. 68. i wish i ate breakfast, but then i'd have to get up earlier. 69. i write in my blog for myself. 70. i don't give a shit who reads it. 71. i really like the format since i'm mostly on the computer anyway. 72. but handwriting an entry in a journal something i'll always do. 73. i probably have 20-30 completed journals. 74. most of what i wrote in them is probably humiliating. 75. i have no idea why i keep them, except that i've had the urge to write in them for years. 76. i get a little upset when there's something i do not(cannot) understand. 77. i want to understand everything. 78. i accept that i'm never going to understand math. 79. i dread having to face math again now that i'm returning to school.  80. pms makes me insane. 81. i also break 80% of whatever i touch when i have it. 82. i know it's just my hormones, and it seems to make no difference. 83. i'm a huge dork. 84. mostly i'm happy that way. 85. every once in a while i wish i was cooler. 86. i want to stand on the Great Wall before I die. 87. i also want to stand on the streets of Tokyo. 88. i want to know experiences i'll never forget. 89. i love more than i'll ever be able to understand. 90. i believe that love is my prime reason for living, in perhaps even the meaning of life . 91. i talk too much. 92. something as simple as me talking too much and knowing someone wants to listen anyway makes me feel incredible. 93. i was starting to give up on the things i wanted to find in a partner. 94. now i think they might exist after all. 95. it's very hard to believe. 96. my life feels best to me when i can live in the present. 97. i really want a 4th tattoo that says "to hold on, let go" in latin. 98. i think i need to get it done soon. 99. i feel like maybe things are starting to come together. 100.Sometimes, a Coke Icee is just what I need.&nbsp;

      The funny thing about City of Heroes is that at first the idea did not appeal to me whatsoever. It was just some online game I had heard about where everyone played superheroes, and having just come off of playing Final Fantasy online, I was in no mood for some street running beat-em-up shit. This morning the fucking game actually almost deterred me from going to work on time. I was creating a new character I got the idea for last night, and I'm really liking her. I had plans tonight, but I cancelled them because in all honestly, I'd rather go home and play the damn game. Yes, I'm a huge dork, and fuck it. I'm having fun. It helps me to subdue the sheer amount of moron killing I'd like to do in the real world.  New dosage of antidepressants starts today. I feel all electrical and weird. I remember feeling like this when I first took them. It's not a big deal. In all truthfulness,I'm excited about taking a better dosage, lately the symptoms I got relief from before are coming back. Last night the irritability and frustration got so bad it felt like a rock in my chest. Garren was there and was as always, supportive. I have a fear of him seeing my weaknesses. It's very humbling realizing this kind of fear-it's a total vulnerability. I guess I should be scared to reveal that, but I'm not.  Certain family things are getting harder. I feel trapped financially, but something must be done, or at least planned for. I don't want to miss out on my own independence because my family makes me feel guilty for not signing my life over to them.

      Considerate. you care about the wants and needs of others. Attentive. so present in a conversation-not just waiting your turn to talk. Helpful. you never pause to think what you can do. You just do it. Creative. you have so many ideas. I hope you write them all down. Communicative. it's funny that you think you're bad at this. Honest. it's so hard to do it, and so easy to avoid doing it. but you do it. Noble. it's been a long time since i've been able to say this about anybody. Gentle. i can't even describe it. my heart just gets too overwhelmed thinking of it. Flawed. and not afraid to be so. &nbsp; you amaze me, astonish me, capture everything i ever wanted to be near.

       googly woogly    &nbsp; My posts are getting mildly redundant. Every monday is "I had a great weekend." And for those of you who are tired of the mundaneness of my posts, I'm sorry, but apparently happiness is boring on paper. Or type. Or whatever the fuck you're currently tuned into. &nbsp; Saturday Wes and I hung out, which was cool because we never get to. Also, it's cool just to wander around in the daytime, enjoying time off. At 5 I came to the gallery and we all worked a very boring low key party. At the end I learned the term googly woogly, which apparently means to get wasted drunk-Tony had us all laughing about it. And then Garren and Wes and I went out after and we all got very googly woogly indeed. Funny how drunkenness seems to make you think you're invincible-I danced for hours and didn't feel tired. Of course yesterday and today my body has felt like total shit. I'm going to the gym, people-27 is too&nbsp;young to be complaining about back pain.&nbsp; Regardless I had a great time. Sunday we hung out with Lani and Jill, who I like more and more every time we see them. Life seems remarkably easy some days. I find myself blissed into the gentlest rhythms, simply floating along. &nbsp; The only thing that is really bad is the bullshit with me and spending money. This month has been terrible. I'm determined to defeat this. I want to still enjoy buying things, not do it compulsively and constantly. I am working on it-I sent a big chunk of my paycheck to a cerdit card yesterday. I'm going to keep doing so until this shit is paid off. I hate the crushing feeling of debt. &nbsp; I had yet another crazy dream last night, Wes and I were on a huge boat-like thing with many other people. I think we were between cities or something. We were responsible for the lives of the people aboard, but we werent in positions of power, we were just ordinary people. It was odd. Then again, when it comes to what I dream about, a purple flying squirrel that talked wouldn't be out of the ordinary. &nbsp; &nbsp;

       bed bed bed bed bed   so tired. so tired. soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo tired.  I need to start getting enough sleep to get through the day. I mean, I'm not missing tons of sleep, but over accumulation time I start to really droop.  I'm all about 5:00 today, and getting home, and getting in my bed.  It's thursday, so it should be almost the end of the week, but somehow it's not, because tomorrow we have an event to do early and then saturday I'm off and have to go to the Gallery from 5-10 for a party there. I think saturday before five is going to be spent in bed. I crave bed. I must have more bed.  I had some epic dream last night about a massive house I was in with a bunch of other people. There was a huge storm going on outside-I guess a hurricane. I had the usual feeling I get in these dreams-of being caught up in a big event-it's always set up like some movie. The house was elevated on a slope or something and the whole of the land around it was visible, and waves were crashing around as the ground flooded completely. At one point it seemed safe-and then the water started to pour inside the house. I remember running, trying to get to the highest point, climbing a metal spiral staircase that led out to the roof, and being freaked out because the water was still coming. It should mean that I'm overwhelmed-that's pretty basic dream symbolism-but I'm not right now. The similar feel of these dreams makes me wonder where they come from in my subconscious.  It's 10:30. I'm struggling to stay awake. It's gonna be a long day.

      it should be illegal to get up at 7 am, to face a 13 hour day, with major pms cramps. I'm just saying.

       i am a moron   So going upstairs at the Baronne St. Office today to get lunch, I run into Adam, the manager of Tipitina's Uptown. He's always friendly and ready to strike up conversation, and since I'm working in Special Events now and helping to promote his club I figure I ought to be networking, right? Making myself a familiar face. So we're talking a bit, and it's going well, and it seems it might have been a nice interaction if I hadn't ended it by falling UP the stairs. With an armful of cd's, half of which I crushed. I totally felt the "wow, that was classy" vibe from him as he ran up to help me out. Conclusion: When I have PMS I don't even think I should be allowed to  walk.  Maybe I could just do a few days of confined bed work. Sigh. I also earned a big slanted red mark on my inner left arm (yes, in case my faithful audience is wondering, Did she fall on the wrist with the possible Carpal Tunnel problem, of  COURSE  she did). It's a good thing I have Garren...I don't know who else would put up with me. Somehow I managed to not be a complete dipshit long enough to keep him around. :)  However, I think about the time that Josh almost fell over his own shoes and it makes me feel a tad bit better.

      It was a nice weekend. Lots and lots of gaming. I finally tracked down a copy of Chocobo's Dungeon 2. What an adorable game this is. I get to play this guy:     There's just some things that I'm proud to be a ridiculously overexcited girl over. And this is one of them.  Garren, Hai and I shopped most of the day Saturday. My credit card was already aflame, so I just shrugged and bought more shit. We ended up going to Lakeside Mall and stopping by Babbages, where I once worked. It was really nice to see people I hadn't seen for a long time. They were really happy to see me. It made me feel great, and for some reason, it helped me to let go a bit of what happened to me there with meeting Chris and that whole drama. Lately I've noticed how much all of that is fading away, like a life I never really lived.  This morning I went to the doctor and had a weird little nerve test on my left wrist which has been hurting for a few months. I should find out this week whether or not I have Carpal Tunnel. I'm just glad I can get it addressed so I can do something about it.   Got to do laundry...

       the score to June sixth   Rufus Wainwright's Want One. Beautiful, plainitive melodies and distinctly unamerican lyrics. A voice I could listen to for days and not tire of. Donnie Darko soundtrack. Strangely sad, amazingly beautiful. The sound of passing life. The cars that pass you on the road. The strangers that look at you on buses, glances you'll never see again.  I'm floating again. Utterly displaced. I'm losing meaning. I missed the entire slipping process. I just looked and something was gone. The meaning of me, individually as a person, is out of my grasp right now, and I don't know where I ought to look. I had utterly isolated. My phone was silenced. My body was still. I felt the extent of feeling totally empty, constant restlessness, no core to go to, draw from.

       residuals   When I see Jonathan when I drive down Baronne, there's a dull pain in my heart that spreads it's radiation to the ends of my ribcage, and I just don't understand why it hurts so much that I should let go of someone that hurt me so repeatedly. It seems to be the familiarity that hurts the most-when I look at him I know exactly how long his legs are, how he moves his hands when he's talking, and how he smiles up close. He was always so hurt and upset by the fact that I didn't seem to prioritize him after the breakup, and frankly, I didn't. I knew he was important but after years of spending time around him and dealing with the quirks and hurtful bits, I wasn't in a rush to go back. I thought often that he was someone I could let go of without trouble. The sadness of losing a closeness after I have spent time and effort developing it is always intense for me, although lessened if I found out the closeness wasn't what I thought it was. This was not the case at all with him. For whatever reason I couldn't stop loving him as a person, even though I fell out of love with him a long time ago. I have to fight not to call, even though there would be little for me to say except that I hope he's doing ok. I hate this sadness. I feel it makes me weak and worse, I don't understand it. Is codependency really this hard to break?  I'm struggling everyday with living in the now. It can keep my panic attacks and round and round thinking away, but I keep forgetting I have to practice it. Sometimes even when I practice it, it fails. Lately I've been feeling tired, my emotions have worn me out this weekend. I wish I could absorb life at a different pace. I tend to think ahead in great detail, imagining every possible outcome. Sometimes it's good, because it aids in the decision making process. Other times I think it's a useless waste of my time. This struggle for control seems so pointless. I want to relax.

      Nothing is sure. Not ever. There's no sense in getting upset with people when they change their minds. Things change. People change. Decisions change. Everything moves in a constant flow. DO not cling to any one thing. I keep trying to remind myself of this.

      no matter what's wrong with me, 10 hours of sleep seems to fix it. This is good to know. I like being up this early. Although I don't foresee myself going to bed at 9 pm every night, it's cool waking up at 7 feeling totally rested and ready to deal with the day.

       What dreams may come     I dreamt of my cousin Cory and his upcoming visit with my aunt this month. When she initially arrived and I asked to see him, she pointed me into a room where I saw the three year old boy I remembered. He was playing and talking the way that a three year old talks-that sense of self that has it's own realm of existance eminating loud and clear. Later I came back into the room (at this point it was my living room) and saw the 16 year old Cory: a young, handsome man in a plaid shirt, playing the acoustic guitar. He was very attractive, and I remember this causing some odd emotions in me. Very excited to see me. All I could do was shake my head and say, "I was 10 years old the day you were born..."He looked at me with glowing eyes, and I wondered what I had ever done to leave him with an impression he remembered since his childhood.  Saturday was a good day. I spent the evening with Lani and Jill and watched X Men which I really liked. I wish I had read these legendary comic books, rather than learning their stories by way of Hollywood, even though the movie was good. Sunday Wes and I mostly spent playing City of Heroes, which to me was the ideal way to spend my time off. I realized getting dressed this morning that I've had stacks of books and movies lying around unwatched, because I'm really absorbed with this game.  Garren's been gone for four days. I wasn't sure what it would be like. It hurts, but not in a sharp way. It's a soft ache that sort of lies just underneath the surface of my skin. I miss him in flashes, his smile, the way he talks too fast when he's excited to tell you something, the pure tone of his energy. The truthfulness. At this point in my life I'm a glutton for this truth-after all the lies that I've been told and that I've told myself-there's no such thing as too much honesty. This thing about energy: as I get older I start to get a clearer read on people through the energy they project out, at me, at others around them. I've been sick in the presence of too much negative, while in positive energy I flourish. I crave different kinds of things than I used to. This is a more authentic self than I have ever known before. It's wonderful.

      White chocolate Kit Kat is back. And eating one is the equivalent of having sex with the Lord himself.  That's all for today.
