      i am still here....prom is probably in its fullness right now.  and i am still sitting here.  i have been watching my niece, and it has been a pretty good time.    i haven't even tried to call anyone about any parties or anything...i still might...but i am quite content right now here by myself..  quote of the day.... Although we have different ways of worshipping and doing things, we have only one God. So how can we claim to have... "Good News" unless people can see in us that Jesus Christ is breaking down barriers and bringing us together?          ... Albert Braithwaite

      well, i am still here...kind of in shock actually...  my suspicions gave in, and i downloaded a video off of kazaa....it was the beheading of the US carpenter by the terrorist group in Iraq or Afghan....I am so sorry I did, it was horrifying. i can't believe that i would watch something like that...  my heart beat was pounding, and tears about came to my eyes....i had just watch a person be murdered....i wish that i never would have done that...  I give my condolences to the Berg family.  It was the most horriffic thing that I have ever seen, and I hope that justice will be served to the bastards that did that.

      i've been sitting here thinking about what I could do today.  prom is today, and everyone is busy doing that, and since i am not going, i am stuck here hoping to at least go to a party or something.  i thought about going to kurt's but i don't know if he is still on that because of stuff that has been going on the past few days for him.  as for me, i wish, now that i could have went to prom, but there is only one person that i wanted to take, and she is with someone now.  doesn't that always happen.  maybe i should go to the races again, but it is raining now.  wouldnt that be my luck.  i can not catch a break in anything.  one day, something might come together for me, but it is not this day...

      What do I say to the one whoâ€™s so true, Do I speak words to thee, What shall I do, I guess that we shall see, Or should I profess thy feelings, Or are they mine to keep I am jumping from thy ceiling, Not able to sleep, Sometime I may say, What I truly mean, Until I come to that day, I will be mien, When will it arrive, Until that day I will take the dive   I wrote this myself for English...thought I would put it out there...
