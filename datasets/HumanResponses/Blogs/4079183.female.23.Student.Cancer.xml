						    I am always busy on the weekends that my children are away. I have all sorts of things on my mind but I am lacking the time to share them today. Sorry!      In regards to a comment from Jane... I appreciate my first comment and thank you. I have seen "The Blob" a few times but long ago. I am glad you enjoyed an older horror movie that took place back in the day when things were so simple.       To all others: A lot more interesting things to come in the near future...

						    With risking sounding like an ancient horror movie, yet not remembering what the name of that old movie actually was I decided to name my first title "The Blog" anyways.     &nbsp;  I would love to look back and see what others put for their first blog but then again this is me, so here goes.&nbsp; I am Brandy as those of you who have previously known me know.&nbsp; I just had my 23rd birthday this month along with my first wedding anniversary with my ever so loved husband Robert.&nbsp; I am the mother of my two beautiful daughters:&nbsp; Allysha (7) and Allyssa (3).&nbsp; My daughters were not fathered biologically by Robert however he is the only father that I have ever considered them to have.&nbsp; I was introduced to blogging by in reality by Jane, the wife of an ex-boyfriend that I had many years ago.&nbsp; That's pretty basic for now...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

						   My youngest daughter Allyssa is three. I have been trying to teach her simple things like colors and she doesn't seem to be learning any of it. It is hard not to compare her to my other daughter and what she knew at that age but I try not to as everybody learns at their own pace. I have even questioned if she is color blind, this I highly doubt but it gives you an idea of my struggle with this. Is there anybody that could give me any help with this? What should I do or try next?

						   Is there nothing normal about the weather anymore?  Last week I wore a jacket and had to run the furnace at night. Today I am wearing shorts and have the air running. I understand that the seasons are changing but I am getting fed up with the changes in the temperature. It must be nice to be a meteorologist. I hope someday that I can have a job and be wrong at any given time and then just say oops! I don't believe anything that I hear about the weather anymore. If I step outside and it is raining, then hey, I guess it is going to rain. Pathetic.

						   Planning a cesarean when there is no medical reason to have one.  I have heard that these days many women are choosing to set a date to have their baby on rather than letting nature take it course. They seem to be doing this for their own convenience and I do not agree with this at all. If your schedule is so busy that you have to plan when it would be convenient for you to have a baby then chances are that it is not the right time in your life when you should be having a child. Women's bodies were made to bear children naturally not by an incision and pulling them out. I can understand if this was done in an emergency situation or was necessary, but please... I think people are taking certain practices to levels beyond need.

						   My youngest daughter turned three in March. It is August 14th today. I have been on birth control since shortly after my youngest was born. That means that I have taken over 1,230 birth control pill over the years. How long does it take for a woman to get pregnant after being on birth control so long? I guess when it happens it happens. I have looked in to this issue quite a bit but still wonder how long does the pill actually stay in your system? I have heard many people get pregnant on the pill or miss one and it happens, so I guess time will tell.

						    I went to breakfast with my husband this morning and I had to bring this topic up. There is a waitress that has been working there for 5 years and she has three children. She does a great job but besides the good I always notice the flaws in other women. Who knows why I just always have I consider that to be normal for me. This woman spends too much time in a tanning bed, you know people do when they are an abnormal color for a white person. Then she can tell she cakes on the foundation, this I don't understand... I think people look better without all the crap on their face rather than trying to cover up their flaws that are only made more noticeable by the make-up. Then she has a noticeably large ass. It doesn't necessarily look bad on HER but I wouldn't want it. My husband has many times commented on her ass being large yet I glanced up at him today when she walked by and he was looking at it. I had to giggle to myself but he noticed and demanded to know my amusement. Don't get me wrong I am not one of those jealous wives, there is nothing wrong with looking or even flirting a little as long as a person doesn't cross the line. I guess I have no point to all that I have said I just find it amusing. I think it is just a man thing. I guess if I don't think that something looks good I don't pay attention to it, I just look past it. Look for something better to look at. I just thought that someone besides me may get some humor out of this.

						   That is the name of my husbands son that is six years old. We have not been able to have him in our lives since Christmas of 2002, when his mother found out Robert and I were engaged.  Ascension's mother teaches him to hate his father. She hardly ever has the boy he is usually with her ex boyfriend and his parents since they have a lot of money. The ex boyfriend has been in Ascension's life since he was two.  We will be taking her to court to get set visitation back since she has been in violation of the court order that was set more than a year ago stating that my husband was to be able to see his son when Ascension is at his grandfather's house. Robert is good friends with Ascension's mother's dad (grandfather). Since the court order was set Ascension's mother will not let him stay at his grandfather's house thus not letting Robert see his son.  I think that she is afraid that Ascension will love to be with us and grow to not like the person who has never been good to him. Robert is an excellent father. He may not get to be with his son right now but he is the only father that I have ever considered my children to have. I think Ascension is missing out on very important time with Robert. I do not understand how the legal system can prevent a loving father from being able to see his son.  There is much more to say on this subject, I will add more at a later time. In some cases I feel that the father is not given enough rights as a parent just because the mother carried the child for 9 months, sometimes the mother's are given too much power and I don't think that this benefits the child in any way.  I think that we should fight for joint custody. We moved here because Ascension lives here. We have lived here for two years and only got to see him barely a month and a half of it. He got to come over here a lot until one day when Robert was at work and Ascensions bus dropped him off here to me in the afternoon. When Ascension's mother got off work that day and came here to pick him up he started screaming and bawling because he wanted to stay here. That was the end of him spending so much time over here. I like to see my kids get upset when they have to leave grandma or others, at least this way I know that they like to be there.  More to come..

						    Why do clothes cost so much? My daughter is into the "Bratz" dolls right now. I was at the store and have a hard time knowing that a tee shirt can cost $15.00 It can be hard having a child in the public school system. I want my child to have all the stuff that everyone else has but financially it is impossible when she grows as fast as she does. I think that kids clothes should be cheaper than adults since they are continuously growing. Face it, after a certain age we stay basically the same size unless we overeat/undereat or get pregnant... What is your opinion on this matter?

						    Things sure have changed over the years...      I went and purchased my daughters school supplies today. Her school has millions for their budget. I guess I can understand crayons, pencils, glue, &amp; etc. I refuse to supply them with film, ziploc bags, and clorox wipes. I think that they are taking the supply list too far. What do you think? I did however purchase Kleenex and dry erase markers. I questioned the dry erase markers but at least I know she can blow her nose.      millions...

						   My husband and I have decided to have a baby, our first together, and my last.  This will also be my first planned pregnancy.  This news has made me extremely happy lately.  We have decided to hold off until we move in our house though, that way we will be situated, have enough room, and we wont have to move with me pregnant.  I am sure that there are people in my family that will not be happy about this since I almost died from the last baby, the hospitals stupidity.  I am an adult after all and dont beleive that anyone elses opinion should matter anyways (family member).

						   It always seems that the same people comment in groups and back the others up. It amazes me that no other people comment on their blogs. Could there be a reason for this. Yet this people never agree with what I write but continuously view my blog... Do these people have a lot of time on their hands? I know I barely have enough to just turn my computer on. I am glad that I am not one of "those" people. I am also glad that I do not see an argument in everything that I write, it is merely a comment or a "blog" written by me.

						    People who live in the United States should speak English besides what other language they speak normally.  English is our National Langueage and if you can't speak it you eaither need to learn it or not be here.

						    Here's another thought from me:      I do not think that the following should be able to become pregnant or have babies: retarded people or people that will definitely produce mentally handicapped children.         I do not think that anyone should be allowed to have children until they are financially able to take care of them.      I think that instead of delivering food to the starving people over seas that keep reproducing kids that they can't feed that we should have and should place them on some type of birth control.      Whether or not these take away certain rights I think that they would better our world.

						   Here's my statement...  I think that prostitution should be legal. I believe this both ways for men and women but I will be referring it in the following way. If there are women out there that need money and are willing to earn it having sex then let them. The same goes for the horny men that have or need to buy sex to get it. What is so unfair about this? I feel nothing. I think that the government just makes it illegal because they know that it is still going to happen no matter what and this way they can collect money from fines.  This is allowed in Nevada. How under one constitution can different states make up their own laws? What would be wrong with having some more bunny ranches?  This is allowed in gentlemens clubs no matter which way you look at it. I guess people just think that they are just "dancers" but how is going into a special room or a "VIP" room any different. You are still charged more to do what you please at their discretion. Paying for sex is paying for sex, no matter if you are a whore, a horny bastard, at a bunny ranch, or at a gentlemens club.  We all know that sex is an industry in itself, if you know what I mean. We have all heard the phrase sex sells, so what's wrong with selling sex?  Would love to hear comments on this one. I am a firm believer with this topic. There will always be those diseases out there no matter what we do, and realistically we wont stop having sex, even if it kills us.

						   Last week I went to go pick my husband up from his shop at midnight and on the way home we took the interstate and stopped to help a family on the side of the road. There was a man, woman, and three kids standing outside with blankets wrapped around them. They were pulled over because of a flat tire. The family was on their way to Disney World in Florida in their van. The man couldn't even change the tire, he didn't know what the tool to change it was called, and besides that the cable to hold the spare tire on under the van was rusted on and unable to get off. Even if a person could get the spare off it would have done no good beings it was flat.  I do not understand why you would drive your family a thousand miles or so and not have proper equipment or the means to fix something if you needed too. Especially a flat tire.  My husband is a nice guy so he took the tire off for them and drove back to his shop and in the dark tracked down another tire and then converted it to the rim and so on.  The family was really nice and appreciated it very much. He didn't charge them anything but they gave him money anyways. Triple A would have been there in two hours they said.  On the way back with those peoples tire we discovered 2 more vehicles pulled over 2 miles before the van. After my husband helped them we went back to help the other because we don't feel that it would have been right to help one person and not another.  The one car had a flat but since it was an old car they had the proper spare and tools in the truck to fix it. The other vehicle was a 2004 Ford SUV the guy had the spare off but the rims that he had on there were so fancy that the 4 way wouldn't fit to take the tire that was messed up off. My husband then again drove back to the shop and grabbed a special tool and the big jack since this guy was pulled off on to the grass and his vehicle wouldn't have been able to be jacked up right from a little tire jack. This man was really nice, he had two and a half more hours to travel, he said that he also had two daughters about the same age as mine. The guy informed us that there was a piece of metal on the road that he walked back and threw in the grass. That's why there were so many flats in a short distance. The guys tire was sliced in half, almost in two pieces! The guy asked if Robert would take any money and my husband said no that's alright and the guy insisted that he would at least take a few dollars. When we got back into the car thinking that the guy had gave him 3 dollars we found that he had handed him three twenty dollar bills!   I guess it goes to show that there are still good people out there in the world that could use your help. I still figure people should go by their best judgment when stopping on the dark interstate in the middle of the night to help others.  I guess I hope that this makes others check to make sure that when traveling that they have all the necessary equipment to keep their journey on the right track. Well at least have air in your spare tire!

						    There has been alot of debate lately on the definition of love.       I have always told my husband that love cannot be defined acurately.  I feel that Algor according to Jane's Blog has it correct.        I feel that "Love" is defined differently by everybody.  Here's some input from me on my heart...      When I am really sad I get a deep feeling in my chest right by my heart.  I guess it feel like my chest is caving in..      When I am anticipating an answer that I don't necessarily know if I want the answer to, if I am upset, or my adrenaline is pumping  my heart beats so loud and hard I feel like it could explode.      Then there is certain points of time that my heart just feels like it is quivering, like waves are passing through it.  That is my feeling of love that I associate with my husband.  The only time that I feel it is when he holds me, kisses me, or ect...  Thats is the only way I can describe it for myself, even though that definition is narrowed a bit.      Love towards my children:  I refer to love because I could not care for them any more than I do.  I want the best things possible for them no matter what it takes.  I never want them to have difficult lives, even though sometimes keeping that from happening may be impossible.   Other things I could not care less about.      So Love...  may be a definition that you can not define, but "Love" is something that we all in our own way feel.      I read an article today on MSN that had a women who had been with her boyfriend for 6 months and they haven't said that I love you phrase yet.  She was asking whether she should keep her silence or blurt it out.  Read it if you wish, I don't have the link but sure you''l be able to find it.      My Opinion is:  Just do what you feel is right.      When my husband and I started seeing each other I fell in love with him within two days at the most, but I never said a word.  I had already been in one of those relationships where I had loved someone and they didnt love me in return.  So I decided to wait to hear it from him first, besides I thought he was one of those types that was scared of commitment and was just with "the flavor of the week"  (I guess I settled down the unsettleable as I have said)  We never spent a moment apart and two months later we both moved together to where we currently live.  After we were together 3 months, a month after we moved here, he was heading out the door to work for the first day, and he gave me a hug and a kiss, then he told me I love you.  I think it is kind of funny now but, my response was: What?  He looked at me funny then I told him that I loved him too.  I never had to hear him tell me it though, I knew that he loved me, without a doubt, as I loved him.  I guess it is true, actions speak louder than words as I feel my story proves.      My point:  Love is a feeling, not a word that should be defined.

						   I have noticed that others have moments of time when they have what they have called "blocks".  I guess I have the opposite problem.  There is so much that I want to discuss yet haven't.  Lets see...    I think here would be an interesting topic to atart with.  I have many questions that I will later address that I would love comments on.  Scenerio  My husband works out at a salvage yard and this woman came there many months ago to get a part for her car and to get it fixed.  She's immediately attracted to my husband.  This woman has a high paying office job and a beautiful house of her own, and no husband.  Proposition from the woman  Even though I know that you are married  I am wanting you to move in with me.  You won't have to pay for anything and I will buy you anything that you desire.   My question is..   Why do other women try to disturb a happy marriage?  My Information  I have been married to my husband for a little over a year.  We were together for a year before we got married.  We are extremely happy as we have always been.  I am not working and not contributing financially in the household.  My husband has to work hard for all the stuff that we have and even harder for the house that we are in the process of buying.  I am going to college full time to please myself and to make our futures easier, but it will be years before I am finished.  Then I guess that is the grounds for why she would mention her job and her house to try to make his life easier? Or What?  Or is she so desperate that she can't find a good single man?  More information...  I do not know this woman who I am refering to.  I don't even know her name.  That was meant to be that way.  If I knew her name I am the type of person that would confront her without a doubt even though nothing odviously came about from the incident.  Why would I do that?  I am not sure either.  I have always trusted my husband and do without a doubt, but I do not trust other women.  What makes me paranoid about other women saying those things when they know the man is happy and married?  I have put some thought into it.  (My previous relationship was bad.)  I am Not trying to gain anyones sympathy, I consider it a learning process, or a lesson learned.   I just thought it would be interesting to talk about.  Comments Welcome.
