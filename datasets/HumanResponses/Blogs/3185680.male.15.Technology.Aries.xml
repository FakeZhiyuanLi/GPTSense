             ARGHHHH! wats ups mys hommies sappenins ins thes ports sens? hehe i would make an excellent blad!! well any way if u dont no wats happend to me ur very stupid and ignorant cos i told you to stop hiding under that rock!                It all started last friday when i went down to zoo in the middle of blingport i was tearing the place up (as usual) brb *gets pin to deflate the head* (ok owww never put a 3 inch pin into your head) well anyway now the bloods stopped i was skating the mini spine &hogging it as usual stupid little wanabees on there they really knot my knickers!! So was having a great little session all on my todd cos rhys n jon were on there way down so ne way i was nollieing over the spine and if u dont no wat a nollies is go to www.skateboard-city.com/nollie.php and find out i nailed it so many times that day and was just about to try some grabs from them. Well anyway after the worlds most sketchy drop in EVER i was going to slow, nollied, foot slipping of the nose then smack crunch. Oh shit not again> hobble trying to skate owww now even heurts to walk (walks into the shop) Rob i broke my foot again! anyway twenty minutes later i managed to walk ten meters down Herbert(lol sounds like sherbert tee hee hee)Road then i bumped into the two muskateers (jon n rhys) hopped back to the skate park after it took me 20 mins to get 10 meters and then wen i got there realized wat i just did so i rang all my family untill i got someone to pick me up and whizz (lol funny word) me to the gwent i hobbled around 4 a few more hours just to find out i shouldnt be walking on it lol so i got wheeled into plaster to have another cast n my crutches back awwww how i missed them so its my hthird time on crutches in three years :D hehe go meeee now im waiting to go skate again ill let u alls now wens im wells(blad lingou)   ne way ttfn ill speak to u all soon and remember !!!METAL!!! arghhhhhhhhh f**k yeah

       I just had an amzing time at skate X 2 bad the rest of the group missed it i have to thank my dad for insisting i should go though i really should question his motives after all, what is more dodgy that mum was away at cub camp (lol) anyway back to my story... I was on the mini first I got my frontside axle stall transfers down perfect, and also my disasters are like 100% now. Then I tryed frontside axles on the sides and I have got them too (but not too consistant cos it scary droppin in not seeing lol) I also manged to get my tail stalls right and this has done wonders to my runs on the mini. before i was quite slow and could only transfer like once lol after this for some reason I decided to try some proper spins I landed decent 360's which i am quite pleased with and also a few other people seemed to be impressed with. yey i feel good with myself.   My brother though is spending all the time he can get on my board and it is really gettin on my nerves because when i want to skate i find he has nicked it. Though i have to give it to him he probably will get kickflips before me (though thats all he does these days is practice them) he has the technique that i cant master why why does my foot fall down unable to pull back (I blame being able to kick myself in my head lol)  I wish I had gone to skate extreme yesterday though i would have gone had i known rhys would have been there. well next time BOTR meet i really do need to get some footage including of me and in particular of neil. When shall we meet at skate x next i might not have money to go wednesday but i will try. Dats all from Jon cyaz peeps

       After a fond farewell to the skate park we know as the zoo. A little enlightenment was felt throughout the cast as a few new powers have been gained and a few sure left to unfold.we hope to see our new members to be joining us more often even if they cannot harness the true power. They have some power unknown, almost inspires me to fight on. the powers of the mighty board will set us free i call! and may no unblinking eye stop us! the plunder, as next to no actual treasure has been gained as more able veterens took the show. but as we look on we know in our hearts we will be here again, eventually in their shoes. a power is coming that will heighten or crumple our powers for sure to which i do not know but we must find haste and control the powers of the unblinking eye soon on the ones we call el neilio and the viking that is our quest...

       I have been working on this skate video called "board of the rings" it is a skate video of my personal skating and of my mates it might not contain AMAZING shock jaw skating but if you want that go buy a pro video. this is my first attempt at a video and i hope it turns out good. anybody who wishes to view and/or get a copy of this video please ask me. so far the skaters featured in the video are:- * Jonathan Price * Rhys meredith * Eric Wall * Lewis Jenkins * and maybe Neil Powell  i am hoping to get a few more skaters signed up also lol. also the video will contain muck around scenes we feel are funny so far this video has been really fun to do and i'm not a quarter of the way yet.
