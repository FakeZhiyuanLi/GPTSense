      Lol. I got my first comment people! By the way, gushers are the little red fruity thingies in like an octagon shape with the juicy stuff inside in the little yellow packets....oh I don't know. How do you describe gushers? They're like a candy thing. Well I have to finish The Red Badge of Courage today or my mom's gonna kill me. I'm off, my friends. Question 63, here I come!

      Hey people. I finally sat down and actually worked on my summer reading. I am now on question 31. How I wish I could chuck The Red Badge of Courage out the window. I want to go to the movies tomorrow and so does Lizzie but when I told her that I had to get up to question 63 by tomorrow night, she said there was no point in calling dan, mark and emily. Apparently she has no faith in my question-answering ability. Oh well. I'm going to camp next week! Hiking the Career Path. (For those of you who are wondering, yes, I am a Girl Scout, and yes, this is Girl Scout camp I'm talking about here. Laugh you may, but camp is a blast!) I shall write every day and when I get back I'll post what I wrote. I've been taking quizzes again. They're fun.

      Allright people. I finally figured out how to get comments and I am extremely proud of myself so if you have any kindness in your hearts reward my hard efforts and comment! It's at the end of each post next to the little blue timestamp thingie. Oh ya, most of these posts were published on the same day due to the fact that I copied and pasted them from my other blog, which I ruined the template of by trying to get comments. Therefore everything was posted on the wrong day and stuff. It's bad. But oh well. Not that big of a deal. I must be off and contunue on with summer reading. This will be the death of me yet.

      Just got back from the fair. It was really fun, besides the fact that Lizzie made me go on the Zipper. Never again. Ever! I got a big Husky that I named Balto and a fluffy dog that I named Juliet (thanks in large part to Lizzie giving me the idea by naming her dog Mercutio...we were watching Romeo and Juliet a few days ago) Alright people. I shall now start to count down the days till my b-day. 24 days. He he. Anticipation....Oh no! My first post has somehow been lost in the depth of cyberspace. That's depressing. Oh well. All it had was a lil info on me. And of you're reading this, than you probably know everything that was in there. I've been taking random quizilla quizzes lately. Go take some.

      Hello again. I'm trying to decide on which movie to see. How To Deal or Pirates of the Caribbean. I'll probably end up seeing Pirates because How To Deal isn't playing at the mall on Friday. I would rather see How To Deal, truthfully. But Pirates of the Caribbean is supposed to be really good and How To Deal hasn't got the best reviews. Sigh. They're all conspiring against me, I'm sure of it! The guys (Dan and Mark) would probably prefer to go to Pirates too. But then again, if How To Deal was playing Friday, Lizzie and I would drag them to see it anyway. Aren't we so loveable? I'm going to GS camp next week. Yes, yes, have your laughs. I'm a girl scout. Well, I'll post more later. Bye!

      I am extremely annoyed due to the fact that I've tried 4 times to get a comment thing on here and every try has proved futile. If anyone knows how to do this than can you pppllleeeaaassseee tell me? E-mail me at Lilglitturgurl@aol.com. (Yes, I did decide to put this in my profile, therefore someone may hear my plea!) Well, I'm off to go swimming. The summer is going by so fast. It depresses me. I'll post later. Bye!

      Gushers are extremely tasty, don't you think so? There probably was no point in asking that question, because no one besides Lizzie will ever lay eyes on this, and I already know her answer to that question. Nevertheless, I did ask it, and if anyone besides the aforementioned friend of mine comes to visit my lovely site, then I want an answer! *Sigh* Having this site is like talking to a wall. La la la la la. Can you hear me? Didn't think so. Maybe I'll put this in my profile. I suppose there's no harm in it. Well, I'm off for a bit. Four posts in one day is a lot. Goodnight.

      I probably should be doing my summer reading right now, but that would make too much sense, and I don't believe I was put on this Earth to do any such thing. I don't know how any of my friends are supposed to get on this page, because I don't want to put it in my profile, because then too many people would see it. Sigh. What a predicament. I think I'll create another blog that everyone can see, and only show this one to my close friends. Well, onto more pressing matters. I must figure out why Jim is mad at me. This might be complicated due to the fact that he has blocked me on all of my screennames, but nevertheless, I shall find a way to do it! If anyone has any ideas, feel free to tell me! I shall now change the subject entirely just to prove to the world that I'm a flake. I, for one, want to know why people insist on going out at the age of 12. What's the point? You can't drive, so practically the only thing you can do is meet up at the mall and go to the movies. In my point of view, going out with someone is like being really good friends with them. You do all the same things as you would if you were just friends. Going out is just a way for it to be recognized by your friends/peers. Now that I've once again rambled on about my views, I suppose I should go continue on with my summer reading. Yuck. Save me!

      Hello. My name is Tiffany and I am 12 soon to be 13 years old. I started this blog so i would have someplace to put my jumbled and mostly corrupted (thanks to my good friend Liz) thoughts and because I was inspired by my friend Sean to do so. Visit his blog too---http://www.bostwick.blogspot.com. Well, I'll tell you a little bit more about myself. I have brown eyes and curly/frizzy brown hair. I am about 5'4. I play the clarinet, am in my school and church choirs, cheerlead, play basketball, am in the drama club, and am in my church CYO group. As for academics, most people will say I'm a bit of an overacheiver, but that's allright! Well, let's move on. I don't have much more to say about myself so I suppose I will end here. I'll write more later today.

        You're just the happy go-lucky type. You might have your pet peeves, but other than that, you're mainly calm. Blending in with your surroundings, you're the type of person who everyone likes. Usually it's you who cracks jokes at social gatherings - after all, laughter is the best medicine. Sometimes you pretend to be stupid, but in all actuality, you could be the next Einstein.    urlLink   What Type of Soul Do You Have ?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I love these quizzes...

        Your soul is bound to the  Yellow Rose : The Gentle.   "I've travelled through the land of surrender and seen it all.  I throw my heart out and keep my head up, and now I travel through the land of peace."   The Yellow Rose is associated with friendship, intuition, and fun.  It is governed by the goddess Hestia and its sign is The Intertwined Rings, or True Friendship.  As a Yellow Rose, you always look out for your friends.  You would much rather have strong ties with friends than a single tie with a lover and your devotion to your friends is clear.  You may have great intuition and be able to read emotions clearly, but sometimes you can seem distant yourself.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     hmmmm.....

      I haven't posted in over a month. Wow. Alright...A catch up on my life--- cheerbowl is this Saturday (come see me people), the play (A Tale of Two Cities) is sometime in January...nothing's ever specific with Mrs. Director lady. Basketball tryouts start tomorrow (ugh). My mom doesn't have my physical from the doctor so I'm not even going to be able to tryout because she'll forget to bring it to school tomorrow. I had a blast at the semi...Especially the last hour. Then I went over to Eep's (code name for my date, actually stolen from his sister) house and watched Finding Nemo. That's actually a very good movie. Well, I must go now. Gotta finish up the science and math homework. That reminds me! We got report cards on Friday. I got nothing lower than a 97. You all should be so proud!!

      Oy life has been hell lately.  Since my last post, my parents are fighting nonstop.  I've gotten so used to it that I have learned to tune them both out and concentrate on something more important than their incredibly insignificant arguments.  My mother has become virtually unbearable, and I really can't do much anymore.  The only solace I really ever find in this household is when a friend comes over.  And yesterday, when I invited Caitlin over, my mom started yelling at me anyway and told Caitlin to go home. I'm so incredibly lonely in my house right now, because no one is ever home.  My mom is always over at one of her friends' houses, and my dad is constantly working.  I wish I had a pet, but my mom refuses to even consider it, and every time I try to casually bring it up she goes off at me.  Even my last trip to Canada, which is usually one of the places I get to relax and enjoy myself, ended abruptly in an argument between the person we were staying with and my mom.  Ugh.  Well, enough complaining, LOL, just needed to get that out of my system.  I feel much better now!  Other news-- I'm finally going to high school.  Yay for me.  Report cards came in the mail a few days ago, and my lowest grade on my finals was a 94 on the Earth Science Regents, and my lowest overall final grade was a 96 in English.  I hate English.  It's OK though, I will live.  I actually got a 98 on my English final, which was the thing I was most impressed at, even though I got a 98 on the Social 8th grade test and the Spanish Proficiency.  Overall, my grades this year were pretty good.  What really annoyed me was the comment that my math teacher put on there.  I am advanced, and I have an overall average of 99 in this class, and her comment was--seeks help when needed.  Lizzie suggested that she pushed the wrong button when entering it in the computer, but I always had a sneaking suspicion that she didn't like me.  LOL J/K.  About a month until my 14th bday.  Fun times.  My friends are so cool.  I luv them.  Hehe I stole this idea from Em, sorry Em, you know when people copy you it means they admire your ideas!!  Lizzie-  She has been my best friend since I came to Notre Dame, partially because she is another advanced 8th grader.  Her and I have so many mems, most of them pretty stupid,  but it's all good.  She's been there for me through all the ups and downs of junior high, and she was always willing to help me with homework, no matter how much I annoyed her that day.  There is no truer friend that Liz, that is for sure.  I wuv Lizzie sooo berry mouch!!  LOL disregard that statement, all.  But Lizzie/Max/Fille Poole/whatever else she wishes to be called is the greatest person alive! (Except for maybe every former American Idol contestant)  Dan-  Haha.  Just had to laugh at this one.  Wow is the only word i have to describe this kid.  Dan is certainly the one who can make me laugh, no matter how upset I am, simply by being himself.  He is just all around awesome, although sometimes he can just act like a reject.  Too many fun times to even get started on, especially our *ahem* interesting times with Mr. Kane, cut off arms and Intolerable Cruelty.  I know you'll always be there for me Dan.  I luv u!  Em-  Hey Em!!  You better stay on top of things.  I am going to take all of your lotion.  OK!  Em is just cool.  She is just...like...Cool!!  I dunno, she isn't annoying, she isn't over-energetic, she is just laid back and kinda goes with the flow, and that is...as you all already know, cool!  Em is always the person I can have a serious conversation with and then suddenly go all hyper on and she won't even question my sudden change of spirits.  I would go insane if it weren't for her.  I heart you, friend!  Gabe-  HELLO MY DOVE!!  Rofl.  Another one I must laugh at.  He is crazy.  Just an insane guy.  Gabe is the person who can be so incredibly annoying one minute and then say something nice and you just are automatically drawn back to him.  He is a great guy, although I don't tell him often. Plus, he's like the best at Tae Kwon Do and baseball, and he should be a cheerleader, though he scoffs at the idea.  Hehe.  Gabe is the person who refuses to stay mad at me, no matter what stupid things I do.  If I lost all of my other friends, Gabe would be the one who stayed by my side.  Kerstin-  She is just so nice.  When I forget my lunch money, she shares hers with me.  She always went up to choir with me during lunch, when she could still be in the cafeteria doing other more important things (like her English hw, which she never does until 2 periods b4 it is due)  She is the one who walks with me to and from whatever classes we have together or even just near eachother.  She is the one who I can cry in front of about something and not feel stupid.  I can sometimes take this friendship for granted, and I really shouldn't.  I don't know where I would be without my Kerst.  Steve-  He is a person that I can talk to about anything, any topic.  I can constantly change the subject whenever suits me, and he is so used to it now that he hardly notices it anymore.  I went to the semi-formal with him, since he is a grade ahead of me, and it was a blast.  He is quiet and only talks a lot to people he knows and trusts, and I am honored to be one of those people that he likes talking to.  I know I like talking to him, especially concerning my american idol obsession. (for everyone's future knowledge, Diana Degarmo is the real Season 3 Idol.  Go Diana!!)  So many mems!  All 3 Katies-  I don't talk with these girls as much as I do the rest of these people, but they are still very important in my life.  Katie T. and I have been friends since elementary school, and I certainly wouldn't have made it through St. Peter's without her.  Katie W. is just hilarious, and we have grown to be really good friends this year.  Katie S. and I really only became friends because of the fact that she liked a certain someone, but thats OK, cuz she is just awesome anyway, and she is someone who I can complain to while she just listens, and then she can complain to me and I will just listen.  I luv all 3 of them!  Andrew-  This is a tentative friend, that is for sure.  We used to talk to eachother constantly, and we even had a crush on eachother for a while.  Because of my stupidity, however, I have lost him in my life, even though I really wish he would just talk to me.  I have so many unforgettable times with him, and it depresses me to know that there will most likely never be new memories to add.  Andrew, if you ever read this, I miss you more than I ever thought possible.  I want you to know how much this silent treatment is really hurting me.   --As you can probably tell, all of these amazing people have a special place in my heart, as well as a part in the personality I have.  If just one of them was missing, then I would be quite a different person, as is made evident by the last description.  Well, it is getting rather late, and this has been an incredibly long post, so I will end here, on a good note.  My friends are the best people in the world, and no one can ever replace them in my heart.  I luv you all!!

      MY COUSIN IS PREGNANT!&nbsp;&nbsp; Yay Licia!!&nbsp; I'm so happy for you cuz.&nbsp; Nothing really interesting has happened lately, except that.&nbsp; I saw Les Mis twice, once with Lizzie, Dan and Em (although Em didn't sit with us) and once with the Radlowskis (Steve, Anna, Pete, Luke and Mr. Radlowski.)&nbsp; It was really impressive.&nbsp; Better than any Notre Dame production could be, at least under Mrs. Sassaman's direction.&nbsp; It's so depressing...our school has a lot of talent with no way to take advantage of it.&nbsp; Well, I know my posts seem to be getting shorter and shorter, but I must go to sleep now, because my mom is waking me at like 6 to clean the kitchen.&nbsp; I'm gonna go crazy with this cleaning spree of hers.&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; Night!

      This summer kinda sucks.  I don't know why.  It's just not half as fun as last summer, and it's starting to depress me.  I never see any of my friends except Lizzie, not that seeing Lizzie isn't good, but I miss my other friends.  My parent's relationship finally broke and my mom told my dad to find somewhere else to live.  I know that things have been leading up to this for a while, and I'm probably not as upset as I should be, but it's still my dad.  I don't know how I will get by in day to day life with just my mom.  My dad is always the one I go to to scream at about my mom, and now he's leaving.  I WANT A PET!!!  I think I will go crazy if i don't get one.  Jeez, this blog must make me sound so selfish.  Ok, I will stop.  Well, gotta go continue on in the many fanfiction's I am reading.  Gotta love books, they take you away from reality into a great little world that you can form into your own liking.  Night all!

      Yesterday was the Boilermaker!  It was fun.  Except I was running around all day on 3 hours of sleep, cuz I didn't feel the need to go to sleep on Saturday night until 1, and I had to wake up at 4.  So I got up, got ready, went to get a cappuccino from Fastrac, picked up Lizzie, and got to my Uncle Mike's house, where the Schreck family always gathers.  At around 6:30 everyone piled into about 5 cars and we went to go park.  Then everyone wandered for a little while.  Lizzie, my dad and I went to a little bakery (it was cool because they were giving all of the volunteers free food and stuff) and I got a drink and my dad got other things.  Lizzie just didn't get anything, and she refused to skip with me.  Spoilsport.  Welps, then Lizzie, my aunts and I went to our usual Boilermaker spot, otherwise known as "Bitch Boulevard."  Can't you tell the males in our family love us so much?  Well, this spot is like, directly on the finish line, in-between two fences that block people from coming in the VIP area, and our job is pretty much to make sure people don't jump the fences and to re-direct them.  Well, I actually did a few things this year, which is more than can be said for the other years since I was 10.  My first year, I sat on the curb near one of the fences (which is probably the closest position possible thereis to the finish line), watched all of the runners come in, and shook the governor's hand.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make myself known to anyone of high authority this year.  Sadness.  After I did the few menial tasks which I accomplished this year, I went and...what else?...watched all the runners come through.  I really didn't see anyone I knew in the 5K, although Lizzie saw some lady.  In the 15K I saw Mark Murphy, Sarah Freeman, Hillary Holden, Mr. Petrillo, and Lizzie saw her neighbor.  I just missed seeing my cousin Licia by 2 minutes, because security was allowed to leave around 2 hours and 8 minutes into the race, and Licia came through at 2:10.  When I found out about this I was saddened.  Well, everyone went to the post party after the race, and Lizzie and I went to the Volunteers' Tent and got our lunch package and our volunteers' pins.  We then ate and watched the fireworks and fly-by of the jets.  Fun times.  After maybe a half hour we went back to Uncle Mike's and had lotsa food and talked to my whole family.  Joe (my cuz) kept making fun of me for every little thing I did (he's worse than Liz) but it's allright cuz I'm used to his big mouth.  Finally, we left Uncle Mike's and went to my house, then we left again to drop Lizzie home and I went to my cousin Licia's (other side of the family, for all of the inquiring minds) house to watch her wedding video.  It was pretty good.  I got home from my incredibly full day at around 7 and went to sleep at the earliest time I have this whole summer....9!!  It was crazy.  Well, I will go accomplish something now, though I don't know what.  I love summer.

      Things have been hectic this week, and it's seemingly only going to get worse.  Today I leave for that camping trip.  I love camping, but I hate bugs.  Can't win them all.  Then I go to Lizzie's, and I still haven't gotten the present that isn't a present.  Then, after I get home from Lizzie's, I'm off to see Shrek 2 with the Radlowski gals, Mrs. R and Bianca.  Fun times.  Then I get a day of rest Friday, Boilermaker pre-party Saturday, and then the Boilermaker and the post-party Sunday.  Welps, gotta go finish packing!!  I will write more the next chance I get.

      Today I went to Caitlin's house for a cookout, and we swam in her pool for an incredibly long amount of time.  Tomorrow's the 4th of July! I know it's obvious by the date above this post, but I thought I would reinforce it for everyone.  It's the first year that I'm not going to be with my mommy and daddy the whole day!! Tear tear.  Caitlin is incredibly perturbed that I won't be at home the whole day too, because she wanted to hang out.  Sigh.  Just can't please everyone.  Monday I am leaving for a camping trip with my mom's friend Ellen, her daughter who I sometimes baby-sit, her boyfriend, and his daughter.  Fun times.  Casey, my babysitting charge, is literally a lunatic.  Seriously, a straitjacket and some padded white walls are needed here.  I hope I wasn't that way when I was that age, but knowing me, I was probably worse.  My mom tells me that I was a manageable child, but I think she just likes to humor me.  My mom's picking me up on Wednesday from the camp, and then I have to go to Lizzie's b-day party that night.  You're such an inconvenience Liz!  It's a sleepover, so I will come home sometime Thursday.  Then I have something to do July 11, but I've forgotten.  Typical.  I still have to get Lizzie's present that isn't really a present, and I really don't have to get it, just the parts to it, kind of.  Whatever, I don't even know, and I'm the only person who knows what it really is.  She insists that I don't get her anything, because I already got her things and gave them to her on her actual birthday, but what I am getting her isn't anything, although I suppose it is something, because it can be given, and it is a thing!  Is it?  Can anyone help me with this?  I feel like I am talking to a wall.  Stupid wall.  Why do you not speak back?  You sadden me.  Well, onto more pressing matters.  I guess I don't have anything more pressing.  Caitlin was talking to me while we were in her pool, and she started complaining about all the stress in her life.  She's 11.  I don't remember having stress at 11.  Heck, I don't remember anything at 11.  I have like tons less stress than what she makes hers out to be.  It's summer, that girl just needs to relax.   Or maybe I'm just too laid back.  I dunno.  Even if I am, I'm sure that being too laidback is better than being too uptight.  What does this have to do with anything?  I'm going to go to sleep now.  Nighty night, all.

      I'm bored.  In about an hour I am going down to the neighborhood swimming pool with Caitlin.  I don't particularly want to go, seeing as it isn't sunny nor that warm out, and I just don't like going to that pool.  I need to accomplish something today.  I always go crazy in the summer, because there is like no possible way to be productive.  It's so depressing.  This weekend I think my friends and I are going to go see Spiderman 2 in the new theater.  I don't know if I will like the movie, because I have never really gotten into Spiderman or any superhero, for that matter, but I guess I will have to go see it and find out.  I have to read the pigman and to kill a mockingbird for summer reading...fun times.  Well, I will go get ready to go swimming now...sigh.  Bye!

      Hello all.  Yesterday I went to Enchanted Forest, and it was a fun day for the most part.  However, though I didn't really notice it, it was quite sunny out.  Now, I haven't worn sunscreen in like over a year, but I haven't been out in the sun for 8 hours straight either.  Therefore, my un-suncreened body is in much pain due to multiple burns right now.  And that isn't the worst part.  I succeeded in making my face tan, my neck not tan, the bottom of my legs tan, the top not, and there is a spot in the middle of my back which isn't tan because that is where my hair was.  Even I had to laugh when I first saw myself.  Okay, onto other things.  My parents were watching Win a Date With Tad Hamilton last night (I rented it on Sunday.)  So then I go into the other room to see who is online, and I have like 5 IMs up when my dad starts yelling for me to come into the other room.  The movie had stopped, and it was restarting.  Well, this happens to me all the time, and I just deal with it and go to scene selection.  But my parents, who have zero patience and are incompetent with anything that has to do with electronics, apparently needed my assistance desperately.  So I get them to the scene they were at before it cut off.  I go back into the other room.  Two minutes later..."TIFF!!"  This time it's my mom.  It had cut off again, obviously.  Now, after two times I just give up on it for a while, and turn the DVD player off.  Usually after a few hours it will play the DVD the whole way through.  But my parents were determined.  "Fix it Tiff."  "Do you want me to just tell you what happens?  You are pretty close to the end."  No, fix it Tiff."  So I fix it again, yadda yadda yadda.  This happens at least 6 more times before I'm sure all the people I was talking to online were getting pretty annoyed with all my brbs.  On the last time my parents called me, they were screaming and I was ordered to sit down with them and not move until the movie was over.  "Can I say bye to the people online?"  "NO!!! You're always on the computer talking to your friends.  It's like they are more important than us!"  So, I fix it again, and one more time after it stops three minutes after.  Well, I didn't want my friends to be annoyed with me, so I asked if I could just click out of AOL.  They reluctantly agreed to that one, and I typed (very quietly)  to Kerstin that I had to go.  I never said anything to Sarah and Em, I figured that if I took too long I'd get yelled at again.  My dad never yells at me.  My mom yells enough for both of them.  But that night he seemed to be incredibly pissed at the world.  So he was screaming at me every time the movie cut off, and my mom was yelling that she was getting a headache.  After about the 30th time that I went to scene selection, my dad said to stop.  I asked him if he wanted me to tell him the ending.  "Sure, go ahead!!  Why not?  I've been watching this movie for forever, it's not like I actually want to see the ending!!!"  He was so loud that time that my mother said, "Calm down Richard, she was only asking you.  No need to yell."  By this time I had pretty much had it.  I had had enough of them for that night, it was NOT my fault that the movie wasn't working correctly, then didn't have to friggen scream at me!!  I said "Why are you yelling at me?  I'm not forcing the movie to stop and annoy you."  Then my mom turned on me.  "Go upstairs to your bedroom right now."  My dad protested, obviously he regretted that he had yelled.  But she said, "No!  She always gets pissy with us, now we act like she is and she gets mad at us?"  So I went upstairs, screamed into a pillow, the usual.  Then I looked through my photo album.  Seeing pictures of my friends always makes me feel better.  So...Liz, Em, Katie, Yvette, Dan, Gabe, Steven, Andrew, Kerstin, Ash and Serina, you get me through my down days.  LOL.  Well, that's all.  I'm sure my parental dilemmas will interest you oh so much.  Hehe.  Well, I'm going to go eat breakfast now, and then I have to clean the dining room.  Bye!

         Hello again!  I don't know what to write about today, since I have been entirely un-productive for all of it.  But I did get 15 questions of my summer reading done!  I'm on my way, everyone.  Be proud.  To Kill a Mockingbird actually isn't that bad thus far, contrary to what I said just a week ago.  Em lent me Sean's copy of The Pigman yesterday, so I'm all set now.  Everyone who is reading this needs to give me ideas for a fanfiction I am writing.  It's a Harry Potter one, where Ginny has a terminal disease...yes, I know, I can tell you are sooo interested.  13 days until my b-day!  I updated my buddyprofile, if anyone would like to check it out.  Sign my guestbook!  No one has signed it since like December.  Kudos to Gabe for being that person.  Take the quiz, too.  No one seems to be doing too well on it, I suppose I should change the favorite song question.  Well, I have nothing more to say.  I don't even know why I posted, nothing too significant here.  Bye!

      This post is dedicated to Em, who urged me to update.  LOL Em is very important in my blog lately.  OK, onto more important matters.  My cousins came to my house today!!  Actually, they first went to Gabe's house to get me, while my mom was already there.  Confusion.  I went to Gabe's house, along with Em and Liz, to go swimming.  I got there late and left early, but it was still fun.  Gianna, Alli and my aunt Chrissy picked me up from the house at around 2, but my mom was still there talking to Mrs. Hage.  When we got back to my house, I went swimming with Gigi and Alli down at the neighborhood pool (ya, i did lots of swimming today).  After that, I started to watch Willy Wonka with them, and then Ashley called and said she and Dana were across the street watching cheerleading practice, so I went over to hang with them.  After like 15 minutes my dad called me back home and we all went to Tasty Treat and I got a milkshake (because you all really needed to know that, I'm sure.)  Then I went back across the street and Ash and Serina drank like half my shake.  And now I'm home, and I'm listening to random songs on the AOL radio.  My life is so interesting.  Well I'm off now.  I know that this is shorter than my last post, but deal with it.  There ya are Em, the intricacies of my life.  Hope it's entertaining!

       Hiya all!  I am decidedly supporting John Kerry in the next election, though I don't know how much good my support will do, and I don't know why I am telling any of you this.  My birthday is in 16 days!  Yay me.  My party is in 14.  I have yet to let anyone but Liz, Dan and Steve know.  I bet I'm going to inconvenience a bunch of people because I procrastinate to the extreme, but it doesn't bother me in the least.  I spent the whole day with Caitlin today, and it turned out to be quite fun.  We walked down the street to Rite-Aid and I bought some lipgloss for me and something for her because I felt bad because she hadn't brought any money.  Then my daddy yelled at me because it was his money in the first place.  That's OK, it was to be expected, and after the initial anger he calmed down quickly, and hasn't mentioned it since.  I suppose I'm going to spend the rest of me nights until the end of summer across the street from my house at the baseball fields, because North Utica Raiders Cheerleading officially began today, and though I'm now too old for Pop Warner Cheerleading, I'll go watch them unless I have something more important to do.  Doubtful.  Not much happens with me during the summer.  I saw two movies at the Marquee yesterday.  The first one, The Village, I saw with Emily, Gabe and Sarah Crill.  Some of Gabe's friends were there too, but I didn't really talk to them.  It wasn't good at all.  If I had known it would be anything like it turned out to be, I wouldn't have wasted my 5 dollars.  After that, I saw I, Robot with Steven.  That was much better, but I really can't be a good judge.  I was most likely comparing it to what I just saw, and any movie is incredible compared to that.  The robots in the movie were adorable, though.  LOL, I know, I'm strange.  Don't remind me, Liz does it often enough.  I really need to do my summer reading.  I haven't even gotten the second book yet.  Sigh.  I don't want to.  Don't make me!  Alright, if you insist.  Tomorrow!  Anyone who reads this, IM me at Lilglitturgurl tomorrow (August 2nd) and tell me to do my summer reading.  Maybe if I get bombarded with IMs, I will be inspired to accomplish something.  Dan's going to Enchanted Forest tomorrow.  I wish my mom would take me, but she says she would injure her neck further.  I'm having an interesting conversation with Dan right now, if you all would like to know.  I do believe he is finding it hard to figure out what to say...he keeps starting to type and then stopping.  I would just like to take this moment to say hello to Em, are you out there somewhere in cyberspace Em?  This is a shoutout to you, thanks for always being there for me!  I don't know why I just did that.  I hope it made Em happy.  Well I must go to sleep now, everyone.  Maybe I will post again tomorrow, don't count on it.  Bye!
