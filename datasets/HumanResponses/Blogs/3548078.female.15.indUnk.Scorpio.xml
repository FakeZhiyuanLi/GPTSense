      Well today I did the usual. I'm getting better at guitar and the snare too. My fingers ache a lot though but I guess that will be my sacrifice LOL. Today we had gardening at the Nursing home. Mr. Comfort (yes that is his last name was so funny) lol he says he is God's gift to women lol. But anyway bingo was fun I guess though I got the giggle attacks in the middle of calling numbers so I started messing up and literally threw the mic to Steph so she could call the numbers that was funny. Saturday I'm going to six flags for a concert and stuff it will be so much fun! Anthony and Drew are going so I'm going with them and it will be so much fun I can't wait. Tomorrow is Fr. Benson's b-day and I hope I'll be able to go to his party. Anyway that's all for now my fingers hurt when I type...lol God Bless

      Well my grandparents came from Mexico Saturday. They are so sweet! I love them so much. I'm learning how to play the guitar so far I know about 4 cords so I can play one song not well but I'll get there) No nails! OUCH it is very painful and I can't wait to get bloody fingers LOL. I guess I'm doing ok with the snare I could be doing a lot better and I spend too much time with my guitar shame on me. Anyway today was Stephanie's 1st day at the nursing home (she is a volunteer too)She loves it! That's great. Well anyway I better go now...l...I need to get some sleep haven't gotten much of that lately! God Bless.

      Well today I worked at the nursing home the whole day. I met a new person, he will be a senior at Jesuit this coming fall. He is very interesting... no I don't like him like that LOL! He will work there Fridays and Saturdays. I worked there Monday-Friday, so he kept telling me to come Saturday. Of course I won't! It's funny he lives close to my house well sort of and works like a few blocks away. Ok well enough about this new character for now. Nothing special really happened today except that. I'm really tired so.....*yawns* I might go to bed early Andrew kept me awake last night LOL we talked for about 2 hours. It's amazing how you can't run away of things to say. I might talk to him tonight or Anthony either one is entertaining LOL. Bye for now! TA TA!

      Today I brought my guitar over to school so Ms. Castillo could teach me how to play it, so far its just Amanda and me learning. I had fun packing music with Cynthia and just learning new things. I also saw Kelsey today and I showed her how to hold the drumsticks the traditional way (I'm starting to like this way better than the modern one) and we just talked for a while. After band and everything Amanda and I went to Chateau to do our service hours. We talked to Ms. Hilda and Ms. Angie (they're always together and they are our favorite people...LOL) Today was movie day so Amanda and I helped, by getting the people down into the movie room. Amanda and I fell asleep after our first cup of coffee LOL the movie was ok but it wasn't the greatest (South Pacific) Well when the movie ended around 4:15 we were to sign out and everything when we saw Ms. Hilda and Ms. Angie walking a bit to quick for them ...LOL. I told Amanda, they must have something in mind so we followed them! Yep! They did have something in mind alright to run away! Fortunately Amanda and I were close by to spot them and Ms. Hilda kept telling me that she and Angie had to go and needed to get to their car. It was so funny! But we convinced them into getting dinner instead. Mrs. Pauline told us that they usually do that, they try to run away. They forget where they are and start looking for their family and telling people that they need to find their car so they can leave. I think all of this is Ms. Hilda's idea, Ms. Angie just follows her and doesn't really know what's going on. Amanda and I were laughing so  hard after, thanks to God they didn't run away! I love working there....This summer will be great! 14 more days for STEUBI!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Well today was pretty cool. For work study Cynthia and I packed music...Yes packed music in weird boxes and then tomorrow we have to put them in alphabetical order...Great! I'm doing well in band which is really good. After Amanda and I went to do our service hours. We got to call the numbers for bingo...As usual I almost got a laugh-attack LOL. "That is good for one game, is there any more? Clear your cards for a new game" it was so fun talking to the mic LOL. Amanda decided to say at the end" Thanks you for coming to play Bingo with us!" she is so weird!!!!! LOL and we drank coffee with straws. That was so much fun. Friday I have to work there the whole day by myself it will be so scary! I might to go the Jr. High Youth group the Watleys will be there so  that will be fun. Anyway I might write some more tonight if I have time. God Bless

      Summer has officially started for me! Next week I'll have to start doing my service hours and band camp and everything it will be so much fun, I can barely wait! Also I cannot wait for Steubi it will be so much fun!!!!!! Today I went to Six Flags with a friend it was very fun. I've realize that a lot of people don't smile...it's a bit sad, so I decided to smile at every person that would look at me. And, what do you know? A girl even told me "Your skirt is so cute" and she kept smiling and seem happy afterwards. I guess a smile does mean a lot! God Bless!
