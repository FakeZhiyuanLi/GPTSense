      Every once in a while I experience one of those days.  You know the type.  The type that makes you wish you never opened your eyes and started the day.  So, for anyone who may be reading this, here is a little info about myself.  1. I recently graduated from one of this country's shittiest universities. 2. I majored in English Literature 3. I minored in French Literature 4. I have no viable prospects for the future 5. My mind has been absolutely blank for about 4 years. 6. University lasted about 5. 7. I have this insane habit of dropping everything. 8. I am manic depressive. 9. I have this insane habit of leaving everything. 10.I often take time to throw any material items away when the spark to take off hits me in the gut like a bowling ball. 11.I love dogs. 12.I love nature. 13.I hate large cities. 14.I hate small towns. 15.I despise being the minority. 16.I am uneasy in the majority. 17.I can't stand to be touched.  So that's me in a nutshell.  I sometimes go for days in a row completely catatonic in bed.  Other times I go for days in a row severely drunk and beligerent.  I start my day wishing I had succeeded killing myself when I was 9.  After I am done thinking about that I pour myself a couple of shots of tequila/vodka. After that, I make myself some coffee. Grind. On switch. Open fridge. Pull out a half empty bottle of Bailey's/Sylk. Put it on counter. Open cupboard. Grab large mug. Fill mug halfway with liquor. Fill remainder of mug with coffee. Gulp. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. There is nothing but liquor/beer/wine in the fridge.  Of mine that is.  Right now I am staying with the 'rents.  Theirs is junk food galore.  Fat.  Now that is a 3 letter word.    Oh, yeah.  18. I used to have an eating disorder. 19. I used to self-injure. 20. Now I just drink every day.  What am I doing right now? I am sitting at the 'rents downstairs computer listening to my fingers tap the keys of the keyboard.  I am listening to the hum of the printer and monitor.  Two brittany spaniels are splayed across the couches sleeping fitfully.  Little plaintive barks huffing from their floppy velvet brown cheeks.  If I say: 'Where's B?' or 'Get the squirrel' they'd wake up instantly and bolt out the doggie door.   I did the 'rents laundry.  Their kitchen's a mess.   M is recovering from surgery.  She's a bad patient. I heard one of the nurses call her a bitch.  I wanted to turn around and agree with her.  I stopped apologizing for M's behavior long ago.  She was senile at 34.  Gotta go.

         "So what're your parents like?" he asks.    "My bio ones?"    "Yeah, sure."    "I hate them...passionately," I respond.  "Hate's a pretty strong emotion," he replies unflinchingly.  This one's not like the others.  "Okay," I say, "I dislike them with passionate intensity."  He stares.    "Why?" he asks, and before he can finish his sentence, I am already responding to his stare..."I can't forgive them for my childhood."  He stares.  Maybe he is like the others.  No one knows quite what to say.      "Were you abused in some way?" he asks, and all I can answer is: no.  None of those gut wrenching experiences are mine.    Mostly I was alone.  ALONE.  You fall in reality or in metaphore and your 'rents are supposed to be there for you, right?  They are supposed to know when you're falling face forward down a spiral staircase speckled with crackling teeth crunching cement, right?  If you're telling them point blank that you are alone, ALONE, so goddamn fucking alone and you're screaming this at the top of your pre-teen smoke damaged lungs until it is coming out of you in hard rasps like some psychotic mantra, they're supposed to 'get it' - to know something is wrong, right?  No, not my 'rents.   I hate the look of panic in their eyes  I hate the way they peer at me like some fucking specimen or plague I hate the sounds coming from their mouths asking me what's wrong I hate how they cannot hear that I have already stated the issue and have made my case. I hate the transference that they practice like a shrill egomaniac newly inducted into the realms of psychiatry  whose favorite diagnostic tool is: reverse psychology I love them like a cancer on my neck pulsing its  hot poisonous drip down my spine I love them as I scrape the rotting cells from my body I love the way I feel when they are not near I love how their ignorance and bigotry feeds my sense of ego and self I love when they tell me I am successful  that my success pleases them.              I laugh & cry at them.                Love, like hate, is a 4 letter word.
