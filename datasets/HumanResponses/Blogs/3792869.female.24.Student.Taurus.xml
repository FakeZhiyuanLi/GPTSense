      Had a petty flip-off with Robert this afternoon. He wouldn't stop teasing me to a common friend of ours (a girl). He texted me, saying I should ask that girl out or hang out with her or something. He added, he better stop daw "kasi ayokong maging *current love interest* part 2." How do you think I was supposed to interpret it? From what I understood, he was referring to himself and he didn't want to be another unrequited love interest of mine. Diba??? I texted him and told him ang kapal niya if he assumes I'd fall for him (he has a girlfriend kaya, although they hooked up after chatting endlessly and they haven't seen each other for the past 9 years). I added that I would never fall for the girl he was teasing me to because she has a boyfriend and no-no sa 'kin ang taken (ano ako, kabit?).   Robert apologized but said he never meant to assume I'd fall for him. Sa susunod kasi, linawin niya. He's still affected, though. I told him okay na but he kept explaining himself in his text messages. Whatever.  * * *  I'm happy I got to spend a bit of time with another close friend, Sr. Dinah, who will be making her first profession of vows (yes, as a nun) on the 4th of July. She stopped by my apartment to return my CDs, and I ended up accompanying her to the nursing home and community center where she does her ministry. Judy, the old lady to whom Sr. Dinah gave communion, was so charming and sweet. I feel bad that she's really lonely, though. My heart just went out to her when she cried after telling us that being alone wasn't funny. (It's humbling for people like myself who get so caught up in doing their own thing.) So nilambing ko siya. I have a soft spot for elderly people and it's coming out now.   I took pictures of Sr. Dinah "at work." One of the sisters wants to use those pictures for the congregation's website. At least I was able to help out. I've journeyed with Sr. Dinah over the past year or so. Parang ako tuloy yung nag-novice. She has also journeyed with me. We have such a beautiful friendship going. We listen to each other, connect so well, and take turns being big sisters to each other when we have to. I'll be so happy and proud when she says her vows. That's my baby!  * * *  Johnna, my "best Chicago friend," just called and said she was gonna stop by my neighborhood and grab a drink at the Pumping Company, this bar near where I live. I had planned on doing laundry tonight, but maybe I'll squeeze in a drink or two, in between. Oh well. Something to cheer me up and celebrate the end of the day.

      I hate it when I fall in love with my friends. It hurts so badly, especially when it's pretty obvious that things would never work out if we became more than friends. Ewan ko ba. Dunno how I fell in love with my current love interest, but it all happened less than 2 weeks ago. At first I thought she liked me (hehe, assuming ba?) because of some cryptic actions on her part (read: she called me "honey" a lot, sounded so happy whenever I called her, and said all these things that made her seem like she wanted to get so involved with my life, and ) that gave me all these weird feelings in my gut. It's hard to explain why I felt weird, but as I told my good friend Robert, I know I wouldn't feel weird if another girl friend would do or say those things to me. Robert, who miraculously can read me so well even if we haven't seen each other for the past 8 years or so, kept teasing me, saying I should just admit that even a small part of me likes that girl. I denied it for the first two nights and said she just weirded me out whenever she called me "honey." But exactly a week ago, when we got together and I ended up tagging along with her when she ran some errands and hanging out at her place till it was almost midnight, I realized he was right. Shit. When I fall, I fall hard. God, let my feelings pass soon before they get in the way of our friendship.  No words can express how and why I fell in love with this girl. Sure, she looks like the Latina version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but I don't think I fell for her because of her looks. She's really caring and she has this way of listening to you and making you feel she'll always be there for you. When she talks to her family over the phone or tells me about her family and friends, I can see the same caring nature. And she's just so mysterious. She admits she's really secretive, even toward her closest friends, and she appreciates it when they respect her decision to keep things from them (intriga, diba?). She's also religious and socially conscious. Well, she ain't no political science major and journalist by profession for nothing. And she admits she's pretty picky with her friends. She doesn't consider a lot of people her friends, so I'm touched that she considers me a friend. Yun lang, medyo selosa siya.   I can't even describe how happy I am just staring at her dark, expressive brown eyes or her delicate face while she talks, or listening to her talk to her mom on the phone, even when I can hardly understand what she says (except for "hijo de puta," maybe, haha), or just accompanying her or helping her out when she runs errands. I just treasure her presence and enjoy the sweet fullness of doing nothing with her.   I fell in love with her without knowing it and realized it too late. Funny, we became friends partly because I fell in love with a guy I work with (Yes, I'm bisexual.) and kept her posted about what I'd do with the guy (na-develop rin ako sa lalaki without realizing it. The thing is, he has a girlfriend but he's also discerning the priesthood, so di talaga pwede.). So we actually started out as girl-friends, and I even considered her a big sister figure, in a way. (Now I know why considering someone my "ate" can be a big red flag for me. As my best friend knows, I fall in love with or at least get very attached to my "ate" figures every so often.) Too bad she would never fall for me. It wasn't hard to fish out information about her gender. I don't know whether or not she ever had a boyfriend at all because she's pretty secretive about her love life, but as far as I know, she's hetero. =( =( =( I don't even dare to hope that somehow, she'd turn out to be bisexual, too, and give me a chance. I just hope I'll get over her soon. I have to be contented that she wants us to be close friends. And in a weird way, her being dense has its advantages. She has no clue just how much I like her.  We went out last Saturday and ended up boy-watching while killing time before we went home. I can't even describe how painful that was. Now I know why someone once said the hardest thing is sitting beside someone and knowing that you'll never have them. I sure got drunk that night and bawled my eyes out to Robert. Oh well. I'll live.

      Hola! Como estas? Estoy muy bien, gracias. (Tama ba???)   Just parted ways with my friend Monica about 45 minutes ago. She offered to tutor me in Spanish, and we met for our second session a little past 5PM. Our original plan was to get together at her studio. But no. When I got there at 4:55PM (she has issues with tardiness, as I found out two weeks ago), she wasn't home. I rang her buzzer, called her cellphone and got her voicemail twice till she finally answered her phone. It turned out she was in the library, printing some materials for me. Tama ba yon...so for once, na-late rin siya. Good thing I'm more flexible about stuff. I asked her if she'd rather meet in the library and she said that was fine, so I headed there ASAP.  I had thought of going to the library before heading over to Monica's house, just to check if she had e-mailed me any additional materials for our Spanish lesson. But I decided against it because I didn't have time. I took a nap when I got home at 330PM (I came from the library, haha. I was supposed to do my laundry pero alanganin 'yung oras because I need two hours to do laundry.) and woke up past 4PM to answer some exercises Monica had e-mailed me, which turned out to be rather advanced for my level. And I ended up taking a shitbreak so I really didn't have time. Yun pala, she was the one running late. Kung alam ko lang, sana naglaba na lang ako this afternoon, hehe =) Or I should have just gone to the library, anyways, without caring whether she would get upset with me for being late.  I am such an idiot. For some reason, I haven't bought a Spanish dictionary yet. Duh! I didn't realize I should have bought one till this afternoon, when most of the words in the exercise didn't make sense and I had no clue as to whether I should use "ser" or "estar" ("to be," used in different contexts) in the sentences. I just guessed my way through everything. Oh, and I forgot to make a second copy of the materials Monica e-mailed me this week. For some reason, I thought I didn't need to do that because she just e-mailed me a sheet with the pronunciation of letters in Spanish and the "ser" or "estar" exercise. Of course Monica got on my case for that. She asked me if I had forgotten to print a second copy. I didn't want to admit that it slipped my mind because that girl takes everything personally, as she admitted to me last Friday (she's a self-admitted "drama queen"), so I just told her I must have left the second copy on my desk at work. She understands I'm busy at work, so she didn't say anything. Oh, and she told me I should buy a Spanish-English dictionary. I wanted to kick myself when she said that. I don't know why. Siguro nahiya ako sa sarili ko. And I didn't want to give her another reason to get upset because apparently, she gets ticked off with some things easily.  Our lesson lasted for about an hour. We went over the Spanish alphabet and I did a spelling exercise, where I orally spelled Spanish last names. We also went over conversational expressions. The "ser" or "estar" exercise was my downfall. Monica checked my answers and reminded me at that point that I should get a Spanish-English dictionary to improve my vocabulary. Talk about stating the obvious. I don't know why I just got so embarrassed with my self. I couldn't even follow through with the exercise. She realized, though, that the exercise might have been too advanced for me. Hello, I think I had to answer 20 items or something and for the life of me, I don't even know a lot of Spanish words, let alone syntax and grammar rules. I got one item right but she said I got lucky. She kinda got upset with herself for giving me such an advanced exercise, so we ended the lesson shortly. She gave me an assignment: to write a dialogue using the expressions and pronouns I've learned thus far.   I was considering staying in the library, but I thought she wanted to hang out tonight or something and I guess I wanted to just be in her company and catch up with her, so I left the library with her. Well, she didn't invite me to do anything tonight, although she did say she finally bought Chilean wine and we could drink it tomorrow (oh my God, nagiging tomador na ako. I've been drinking more than once a week for the past couple of weeks. Di naman ako ganoon dati.) after our lesson. After we crossed the street, I bumped into Jackie, a student from the Pastoral Studies program whom I met during the "Calling to Justice" conference last February. I just smiled and said hello, and so did Jackie. I don't know if Monica got jealous (again) because I happen to know a lot of people not only on campus but also in Chicago and even in other states (kasalanan ko bang ma-PR ako?), but she said goodbye then. Hehe, at least nag-beso siya sa 'kin. She said she wasn't gonna do anything tonight, though. I told her I'd probably just do laundry and she laughed.  Jackie and I talked for a bit, then I headed back to the library. Hmp. I should have just stayed here after all. I bumped into Marguerite on my way here, and we talked about our plans for the 4th of July weekend. I wanted to kick myself again when I saw her. I meant to invite her to the Discipleship Day organized by the Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters (SSpS) last week, but I kept forgetting to e-mail her the details. By the time I e-mailed her, it was too late. I invited her to the Weekend Retreat of the Grand Rapids Dominicans (in Michigan, which has become my second home this year) in July, but she can't make it because she has to work that weekend. (Hehe, tama bang ako 'yung PR person ng mga kamadrehan? I'm in the wrong field. I should have gone into PR, not sociology...KIDDING!)   * * * My phone just rang, but I didn't answer it because it was JP (a friend from college who now lives and studies in New York) on the other line. No offense to him (her?), I love him to pieces, but sometimes, I wish he would pick the right time to call. We call each other just to talk about how things are going for us, and that's okay. I don't mind making telebabad with him, but I just wish he wouldn't call before 9PM because my cellphone bill just skyrocketed last month and I think I've been using up a lot of my free minutes. Duh, he can always call after 9PM naman or on the weekends and we'd both get unlimited usage that way. Hindi ako kuripot but I'm just playing it safe. I don't want to pay more than $100 for my freakin' phone bill, like I did last month. I'll just call JP back during off-peak hours.

      Okay, taken na ako. Don't know why or how I ended up giving you-know-who a chance, but it just felt so right. And today, I don't feel strange going about my life knowing that I have a boyfriend. Who's the lucky guy? Sino pa nga ba? Robert, a.k.a. Budol (which means "jellyfish" in Waray), my childhood friend turned jowa (hehe, I'm using this term because it makes him laugh). We're officially together, but I still want him to ask permission from my parents and half-brother. I told him that's the least we could do to start the relationship the right way.  I've realized just lately how afraid I am to love. I have no hesitations when it comes to loving my friends or the people in the communities and institutions I've volunteered at/worked with (the Aetas, the inmates of CIW, the babies at CRIBS, the Native Americans at Anawim Center, what-have-you), and I've fallen in love God knows how many times. But I'm at my most vulnerable state when it comes to romantic love, especially when I'm in a relationship. Maybe it's because I'm one hell of a martyr and I've been burned...I don't know...twice? More than twice? I've done a lot of stupid things for love.  Thank God for my friend JP, to whom I spilled my guts out over the phone last night. I told him about the fears about my relationship with Budol that surface at times, particularly the fear of getting hurt and the fear that the relationship could get in the way of my discernment. JP patiently assured me to stick to the relationship and enjoy it, and reminded me, "Hindi natin alam kung paano gumagalaw ang Diyos." I told him that I almost closed my doors, on the pretext of wanting to become a nun, but then something inside of me told me not to use the convent as a shield or cover up for my emotions or what could happen. JP affirmed my decision by telling me, "The worst thing you (anyone) could do is use God as a reason to close yourself off to the person who is God's gift to you."   And thank God for Elizabeth, another lady discerning religious life (I met her during the Nun Run I took part in last April.). When we were on our way to the SSpS community in Rogers Park (my hangout) yesterday, I told her I had a boyfriend, and she was so happy for me. She thought that was so sweet. She also said that was part of exploring my vocation. She congratulated me again before we parted ways.  I've been listening to the voice of God through other people. So far, they haven't discouraged me from getting into a relationship. So what am I afraid of or uneasy about at times? Ewan.

      I am typing this in the library of my school's campus in downtown Chicago. I'm kinda freezing and I don't know if it's because of the airconditioning (which isn't too cold, anyways) or because I got soaked in the blasted godforsaken rain this afternoon.  What a day. I spent the morning looking at apartments and e-mailing and calling prospective roommates who ended up NOT being interested or able to share an apartment with me. Suffice it to say I wasn't in the best mood when I made my way down here this afternoon. Who wouldn't be? I'm under so much pressure to look for an affordable studio (within the $500 range, with enough space) or one bedroom apartment (low $600 range please), or a roommate for the two-bedroom garden apartment in my building or the one bedroom apartment I saw today within two weeks, before I go home to the Philippines for a visit. And I haven't found anything today. Tomorrow is my deadline for confirming with my landlord whether or not I'll take the garden apartment. I haven't found a roomie for that unit yet, so I'm screwed.  If I don't find an affordable studio or one-bedroom apartment or a roommate for a two-bedroom apartment (which I would need to scout for, if I can't have the place downstairs), I am screwed. I would have no choice but to deal with my bitch of a roommate for one more year, and I DON'T WANT THAT. Actually, I'm pretty mad at her because I wouldn't have considered looking for another apartment, if she weren't hell-bent on making my life miserable. That bitch just complained last week that she couldn't sleep well because she could see my desk light from her bedroom window (my desk is in the living room because my room is about 2/3 of hers) and hear me typing at night. She asked me if I could do my work in my bedroom at night--never mind if it means squeezing myself into my teeny desk, which I have since turned into an altar, or working on the floor in the event that I use many books. I told her she couldn't do anything about my working/study habits (i.e. if I work better at night and need a bigger desk, like the one in the living room, especially when I type my papers and refer to several books at a time) and that bitch reminded me that she moved her stupid parakeet into her room (she never asked me if I minded her putting that godforsaken bird in the living room, to begin with) so I could do my work. Ergo, I better do stuff for her?! She even insinuated that I could probably use one book at a time if I were to study in my room at night, so that I could use my desk. Where does she get off telling me to change my study habits, when she takes offense at every suggestion I make? You tell me.   If only it weren't more affordable and practical to share an apartment, I would live in a studio or one-bedroom apartment, so that I can have my own life and not step on anyone's toes. But that's not the way housing works around here.  I was supposed to meet Budul and Rizza at the Shedd Aquarium this afternoon but my bus was running late and I got off at the wrong stop twice. I considered just going straight here (at around 230PM), but no, I was nice enough to take the bus again (after getting off at the wrong stop for the first time) in the f*cking downpour. Well, shortly after I got off at the wrong bus stop and while walking toward the right stop, Budul texted me and said he'd just meet me at the Union Station kasi di na daw ako aabot if humabol pa ako sa kanila. Shit. Wish he'd told me that earlier.  By the way, Budul is in love with me. Okay lang but right now, I could care less because I'm in a bad mood. Di pa kami officially but I want my space. He's going back to New Hampshire tomorrow. Maybe I'll miss him, maybe I won't.  Dammit, my joints are starting to hurt. I better get off the computer, especially since the library is about to close.

      I'm supposed to be working, but I can't concentrate that much. So I'm writing on my blog, hehe =)  I've been such a slacker lately. Blame it on the problems I've been having in securing unconditional approval to start collecting data for my master's thesis. I meant to start collecting data for my thesis this summer, but those bastards at the Illinois Department of Corrections (yes, Steve Karr, I'm talking to you. Damn you to hell, and take your staff with you while you're at it!!!) are taking forever in processing my request, so that shit is up in the air for now. My job keeps me busy, but now I have a lot of reasons to go out and unwind after office hours, especially since I've had several people visiting me this summer. I've been drinking and partying more than once a week, which is so unlike me.   Robert (a.k.a. Budul, which means jellyfish in Waray) is in town for a visit this week, so we've been going out with our friend Rizza and her boyfriend Sherwin since Saturday. Most of the time, we end up having a drink before heading home. (Monday night was the only night I didn't drink with them because I went home earlier due to a headache.) Last night, we stayed out till 1:20PM or so. I didn't go to bed till 2AM. I ended up sleeping in till 9AM this morning--especially since I had such a bizaare dream about going to Chile as an illegal immigrant, despite the dangers, partly to get back at Papa for womanizing (which he denied in my dream, hehe). I know I have flexible hours, but I meant to be at work by 9AM so I could get stuff done before meeting up with Sr. Mary Miller and Sr. Beata for lunch, but I didn't get to leave the house till ten minutes to 11AM. It was 1125AM by the time I got here, so I just waited for the sisters at the lobby, where we had agreed to meet.  We had a good lunch at this restaurant called Mity Nice. Sr. Mary Miller had a gift card valid at that place. Haha, she successfully fished out whether or not I was considering the religious life and how long it's been on my mind. Sr. Beata just listened intently with a smile on her face, as she usually does. It's usually hard to get a straight answer from me because I just smile/laugh/stare at my feet whenever any of the Holy Spirit Sisters tease me about joining them or ask me about what I intend to do with my life. So Sr. Mary Miller was successful.   Sr. Mary Miller is a cool nun. She knows I've been partying a lot, but she told me to enjoy myself--it's part of college daw (maybe she means university/life as a single young adult in general because I'm done with college). It's hard to hide anything from her because I feel she can see right through me. She entered the convent at 14, left at 29 (I found out about her reasons for leaving this afternoon), and worked as an educator for 30 years before she re-joined the SSpS congregation at 60. She had to go through the whole nine yards of formation, and she's a junior sister again, but she's happy with her vocation. So if there's anyone who could discern with me whether or not I have a vocation, it has to be her. For some reason, her jokes always strike a chord within me. Awhile ago, she said it would be fine by her if I were to enter the convent in the Philippines, but added that of course, it would be better if I entered the convent here.  After lunch, we ended up passing by the John Hancock Observatory and the Water Tower because Sr. Mary Miller was taking Sr. Beata to the places where she could take her family, who's coming for a visit on July 22nd. I wish I could have hung out with them the whole afternoon, but I had this nagging thought about my needing to show up at work today. We parted ways after we left Water Tower. I could have gone with them to Sr. Mary Miller's office and to Navy Pier, and I know they planned to go home before rush hour anyway, but I decided to come here and put in a few hours for today. So here I am.   I just realized I could have taken off this afternoon and it wouldn't have been such a big deal and I kinda want to kick myself. I'm gonna see Sr. Beata on Sunday, when Elizabeth and I visit the Rogers Park community, but I have no idea when I'll see Sr. Mary Miller again (maybe when I get back from the Philippines in the fall). I feel like their asking me to hang out with them this afternoon was such a blessing that I overlooked when I chose to part ways with them right away. Awhile ago, when I was with them, it just felt so right and I didn't even feel they were nuns or "the other." It was as if I was one of them.  I have so much to pray about. God help me.

      I think I've gotten over my unrequited love. God knows how my feelings just blossom and die.   I went to her studio yesterday for another Spanish lesson. Surprisingly, I didn't feel the attraction anymore. Maybe I was too tired because I was running on about 3 hours of sleep or so. But for some reason, when we talked and hung out yesterday, I just felt like I was hanging out with one of my good friends. Parang magkabarkada na lang talaga kami. Thank God for the grace of moving on easily.  Well, maybe it's because I had a sucky day yesterday. Five minutes before I left the apartment I share with a two-faced, inconsiderate bitch, my roommate chose to "bother" me with a stupid concern of hers. She asked me if I could work in my room at night if I were to do some reading  (This entry was cut short because my friend/officemate Irene stopped by my cubicle and we ended up talking about relationships for the next hour or so. I found out she just broke up with her then-boyfriend 2 months ago. We ended up going out to dinner.)
