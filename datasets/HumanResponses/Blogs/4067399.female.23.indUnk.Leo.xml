      This is a letter to the editor in one of Montreal's free newspapers, The Mirror;  It is you Canadians who are the evils ones. If I were president of the U.S. I would seal the border. You hate us anyway so we wouldn't be losing a damn thing. You sure love our money though. I have no control over how the U.S. government disperses foreign aid, but I will not spend one cent on anything that comes from Canada. If you think I'm alone, you're sadly mistaken. We are boycotting France and we'll boycott you also. you are collective hypocrites. -Jerry L. Clausing, USA. (from the week of July 29 -Aug 4th 2004)  I'm not actually sure whether or not this is a real opinion -or a real person for that matter, but I do find what he said humorous. It oozes with nasty cynicism and empty threats (yes,  oozes ). And while it may be that this was written as a joke to get people riled up, it could be argued that somewhere there is someone who truly does feel this way. Part of me feels that I should be offended by this, but in reality I only feel pity for the poor soul who is actually that closed-minded. We are so used to hearing the most ridiculous things up here that all we can really do is shake our heads and laugh.  This letter reminded me of the  urlLink speech that Ben Affleck made  at the Democratic National Convention last week in Boston.  He was talking about runaway productions, which are films that go off to shoot in other countries, primarily Canada, because its cheaper. He says that is makes him sick, and any company that does this is giving workers back in LA a 'slap in the face'.  Out of all the 'issues' to discuss at a Democratic Convention, who would have guessed that slamming the Canadian film industry would be one of them? Here we are, a tiny little film industry that produces less than 0.2% of what the American system pushes out every year, and we're seen as a threat. I supposed I can understand though, that this affects the crews more than the directors and stars, but more and more American production companies are bringing their whole crew up here with them. At the same time, being able to come here and make your movie for half the budget means in the end that the product is better (theoretically). In the past we've had many positive collaborations -having American teams come up here and use our staff and crews - where both sides have benefited; The American production gets more for its money, the Canadian crews get work. And to top it off, Ben himself has been in Canada on more than one occasion to shoot a film - The Sum of All Fears  is an example of one recently shot here in Montreal. I didn't see him complaining then! (Actually, I didn't see him at all....maybe he  was  complaining...haha). Overall, since 9.11 there has been a decrease in the number of American productions shot in Canada (or, at least in the province of Quebec anyway). Those who are still coming up here aren't using our crews as much as they used to, leaving many unionized workers with little to do. This isn't just the fault of the American companies, as it has more to do with the fact that the Canadian film industry doesn't have the budget to pump out as many productions as Hollywood. This is also related to the demand we have in Canada for our own films -but that's a whole other thread altogether.  Interestingly, the article ends with a comment about Ben's new reality TV show;  Affleck's latest venture is American Start-Up, a reality show about the world of business that is being billed as being in the same mold as The Apprentice. Some in Hollywood have objected to reality television, arguing that the genre deprives performers and writers of work.   It's also a cheap excuse for quality programming. If anything is a 'slap in the face' to film crews in LA, it's reality TV my friend!

         We Canadians live in a blind spot about our identity. We have very strong feelings about who we aren't but only weak ones about who we are. We're passionate about what we don't want to become but oddly passive about what we should be. -John Cruickshank (in McLean's Magazine)     I found this quote today and it got me thinking about the importance of national identity in how we compare and relate to one another. Especially in terms of Canada, the centre of our identity seems to lie in how we differentiate from our neighbour to the south. It's true that in my own attempts to define what it means to be Canadian, I often turn to the things I know we are not.   Even though I have many American friends, there is always a need for me to separate myself from them through nationality. While it is often subtle, the desire to make that distinction known is always there. It is not something I want to shove in their face, but I do get a feeling of security in knowing that people understand where my perspective is coming from (and I suppose it gives a sense of pride as well). Perhaps this is the only way that we, as Canadians, know how to identify ourselves; because I can't seem to understand any other reason for this type of behaviour. It's not necessarily aggressive, but it's our little way of making sure that people will assume certain things about us -and knowing that they will do this, we can use it to justify our position.   When I travel around in the States I can easily spot other Canadians because of the way they make themselves visible -through actions, symbols and speech -and it seems to me that being Canadian is only important when we're outside of our country. Patriotism seems to be lost in our daily lives, but put us out of context and immediately we go searching for ways to categorize ourselves.   Obviously I am generalizing a bit here. Not everyone is so quick to patch a Canadian flag onto their bag and greet every American they meet with a 'Nice to meet ya, EH?'. In fact, I find that because we are so similar and can relate to one another on so many levels, it makes it that much easier for us to blend in smoothly and comfortably with the US. Perhaps if the current state of international relations weren't as they are, we would be more inclined to do this. Now that the President of the US has isolated his country from the rest of the world, it has become unattractive to be American in the eyes of many people. It seems that now the need for Canadians to distinguish themselves from Americans is stronger than it's ever been -but does this mean that we now care more about our own identity, or rather that the separation between us and the States gets larger?   I have been fortunate enough to meet some incredible people from the States. They realize, as I do, that stereotypes and assumptions are unfortunately hard to shake, and they find it frustrating that they have no control over how the rest of the world sees them. As Canadians I think we can relate to this frustration, in that we're not always taken seriously and often seen as the shadow that lurks behind the all-mighty US. While it's true that the 'arrogant', 'loud' and 'over-consuming' characteristics of Americans has helped to boost our ego a bit, I can't help but feel for those who feel out of place in their own country. [I do feel somewhat used however when I find out about how so many American travelers use Canadian flags on their bags as a way to avoid being identified in other countries -but that's a whole other discussion.]   The States is commonly described as Canada's 'Big Brother' -, older, stronger, more powerful, and always picking on us. Now that they are in a vulnerable situation it is easy to openly mock them. 'Kick the big guy while he's down', of sorts. While I can understand the satisfaction this brings, I don't think it gives us any right to put down people just because we're in a position to do so. I suppose this is where my conflict lies, for it seems to me that in order to be 'Canadian' we have to dislike Americans, or at least, act in an opposite manner from them -yet at the same time, I have to appreciate them because they play such an important part in how I identify myself.   Overall I feel that there are too many questions going through my head and that I'm trying to answer them all at once (and that this seems to be coming out in my writing as well). I think I will come back to this later with a clearer head.

      Ah, so *this* is what it feels like to be a blogger. My life seems somewhat more fullfilled than it did a mere 5 minutes ago..... But will my lack of proof-reading and horrible spelling mistakes cut it in the virtual world of blogs? With a bit more thought put into it than my normal e-mail rambles, and a bit more patients I may be able to overcome my bad habits.  The purpose of this blog is to give me a space where I can freely blab on about anything and everything. Things that I love or hate, or some variation of the two -most likely whatever happens to be on my mind at that point in time. I don't presume to know more about anything than anyone else, but I do appreciate ideas that make me stop and think. I enjoy discovering new perspectives, while I continue to identify my own.  I'm new to all of this, and I'm curious to see how things develop. I appreciate comments and critizisms -not that I'm sure anyone will ever read this -but if so, feel free to say hello!  cheers, Patricia

      I've decided to move out of my comfortable life here in Montreal and head out west. I am still in a position where I can safely back out of this, but don't think that will happen. I am full of many thoughts and fears about this, but feel that this is a perfect time to get out and discovery a part of my country I know nothing about.  Part of me thinks it is crazy to leave such a wonderful city like Montreal, with its cheap rent, great atmosphere and good friends that I've met while living here. But there is another part of me that is bored, unchallenged, and maybe  too  comfortable. The daily routine of my 9-5 job has cause me to fear for my creative well-being, and my reaction to that is to escape. It might not be the best way to deal with my problem, but it's what I feel is right. But why not just quit my job? Why pack up and move thousands of kilometers away? Well, why not? I don't think I'm convinced that I will find something in Montreal worth staying for, so if its going to be hard, why not use the time to familiarize myself with another city? For the most part this is enough to convince me to go -but its not always that simple. People are pushing for me to stay, even my parents said they would rather I didn't move out west, and really, I would find it so much easier to get a job in Toronto than Vancouver. Toronto will always be there, and I feel that I will eventually end up coming back there. So for now, while I am young, not tied down to anything and willing to go, I should take this opportunity and learn from the experience it will bring. It's true that in the back of my mind I don't think I will last very long -and that's OK. I know that I have my family and Toronto to fall back on. But who knows how long I'll be out there? I'm trying to leave things very open, so that I don't feel stuck in any one place. Leaving Montreal is definitely sad -it's the first city that I've ever felt was  mine . I know this place, I know how to get around, and I feel comfortable here. But when I picture myself over the next 5 years, for some reason I can't see Montreal as a big part of my life. I've always felt that this was somewhere I would return, but I really feel as though my time here is done -for now. I don't appreciate the town as much as I used to; I see the dirt, and the violence and homelessness, and I don't take advantage of all the wonderful things here as much as I could. And it's not that I expect things to be amazing and wonderful anywhere else I go, but it may just be that I come to appreciate Montreal more after I'm gone than while I'm here. My feelings on all of this seem to change on a daily basis, so over the next few months it will be interesting to see how everything works out. I am excited and nervous, but also hopeful.
