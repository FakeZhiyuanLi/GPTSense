      Leaving 2 weeks from today, just wanted to start a blog to publish some of the things I do, people I meet, places I go, etc.  Still getting things together, but for the most part everything is set to go.

      Went to Pearl Harbor yesterday.  Buses are off strike so I was able to take them there which was very nice.  It was less than I expected, not much there at all.  Took a boat out to the Arizona memorial and hung out there for a little then came back.  I'll post some pictures of it soon.  Maui in 3.

      My Uncle Dan wanted me to describe a sunset here.  Well I’m no poet, but it’s funny because me and some people I live with talk about sunsets and some of the things we see here.  Simply put, they are indescribable.  The pictures I take from hikes, or of sunsets don’t do the actual views any justice.  The sunsets light up the entire beach, most of the time around here there are some clouds and the sun hides through the clouds a little bit and show rays going above and below the clouds.  It’s a great sunset every night.  I woke up early one morning and hiked Diamond Head and watched the sunrise at about 5am.  When it comes up it shines across the ocean so bright that you can see some of the other islands, Maui, and I’m not sure what the other one is, off in the distance.  Just driving down the road here, around every turn on the beach you see gorgeous coast lines, mountains, everything too much for words, but absolutely breathtaking. Another great thing about Hawaii is the way your body changes.  Several of you that I have talked to already have commented on my tan.  Well, if you spend every day in the sun, on the beach, or doing hikes, you would be tan too.  The hair on my arms and legs is turning blonde, my hair on my head (past the receding hairline) is more blonde now, and my skin is a lot more dry.  Also, you get rid of your “city feet”.  When I lived in Florida it was called city feet.  If you touch your feet right now, most of you have nice, soft, fluffy feet or your soles, but out here you walk around everywhere barefoot, or with sandals on, frequently burning your feet on the sand and before you know it, your feet are nice and hard.  It’s great.  Sometimes you think that you are growing sand out your body you have it everywhere, but it’s a price you pay for living in paradise.  ;-)

      Not much new to report here.  Busses are still on strike, so that is preventing me from doing some stuff.  Me and a couple people from the hostel are going to a cool snorkeling place tomorrow, and then hike Diamond Head again Friday.  Got some new funny pictures up of some of the people I live with.  I have been pretty fortunate with room mates, some shitty ones here and there, but so many cool ones that have taught me so much and given me great ideas, educated me, taught be cool games, it’s great.  Biggest partiers, Kiwis.  Hardest to understand, Scottish, but very friendly and cool still.  Biggest surfers, Aussies.  Funniest, Irish.  Maybe Asians are the hardest to understand.  They love to try and talk with you, and don’t speak a lick of English.  Slept on the beach one night, that was so nice… esp. if I would have had a tent.  Got sand everywhere, nose, eyes, ears, mouth, it was sweet.  Huge waves today at the beach, stepped on a bee.  Hoping things are going to turn into the “beyond?” part of the title of this blog, looking that way too.  Hope everyone is doing ok.  I leave to Maui in a week and will be there for 2 weeks, then off to Kauai for 2 weeks, then back to Oahu.  Should get some cool pics on  Maui and Kauai.

      Went windsurfing yesterday with some people from the youth hostel.  We were out there about 5 or 6 hours, it was a heck of a lot of fun.  We all got our butts kicked though and got nice and sunburned.  We managed to get going one way and get out pretty far, trouble is, we could never master the art of going back the other direction, thus making our trips a little harder because we would have to walk the stuff back.  It was a really nice day though.

      Someone was asking me what staying in youth hostels is like.  Fun, I've met people from Scotland, Australia, New Zealand, Istanbul, Germany, all over the place.  My room just got voted #1 for the least amount of roaches, we were very proud about that.  I have 7 room mates right now, most of them are cool, but new people come and go all the time, most of them are very cool, very friendly, and have good stories to share.  I also had to rent a piece of shit car today, 88 corolla baby!  The buses are still on strike here and it was driving me up a wall not being able to go to places.  I drove to the Windward (east) side of Oahu today and went snorkeling in Hanauma bay - I'll add some pics later.  It was cool though. Job hunt is going ok, a few offers, nothing that blew my hair back, the ones that did require Secret Security Clearance, so I am working on that right now, they go back 10 years into your past, places you lived, worked, people you know, etc.  Pretty crazy but I'm sure it will pay off.  Off to have a beer and chilli cheese hot dogs at the hostel.

      So I did that Diamond Head hike yesterday.  It was 7 miles round trip because the buses are on strike here and aren't running.  But 7 miles was a little tiring, but not too bad.  Today I walked to, and hiked, Manoa Falls which is in the mountains a little, short little hike to a cool little waterfall.  This was a 20 mile roundtrip hike, and only 2 of those miles was the actual hike!!!  The rest was getting there.  But it was a nice hike, my feet hurt though, need to get some hiking boots, my tennis shoes are brown.  I am uploading pics to the website now so be sure to check those out.  Put in a section for each of the two hikes and then some misc. pictures.  If you click on the link at the top in the pics section that says last uploaded (I think) it will show you the latest.  Didn't do much else after the hike, applied for some jobs, went to the beach, they were showing a movie on the beach tonight, pretty sweet huh.  Life is good when I can bitch about my feet hurting from the hikes I've been going on in Hawaii.  Take care.

      Made it to Hawaii a few days ago.  Weather has been great, hot and sunny at all times.  It rains a few times a day but the rain is really more like a pleasant mist.  Right now I'm living with some guy from Boston and two 18 year old girls from Alaska.  The people at the hostel are really cool, we get a few people staying in our room for one night every once in a while.  I hiked Diamond Head yesterday with one of my room mates, the views were spectacular!  I'll try and put some pics up later today.  The bus system here is on strike right now so that is really limiting my travel which sucks, I can't get too far, but I've been walking a ton.  To give you an idea of what kind of people are here, last night, the group I went to a bar with was 2 girls from Germany, two guys from Texas, including me, one guy from Australia, one guy from Boston, and one guy from Philly.  I've actually seen a fair amount of Texans around, saw some people sporting UT shirts in a bar last night.   All for now.

       Intro:  A brief intro for those of you who don’t know about this hike or know that I was doing it. This hike (Kalalau) is one of the most famous in the world, it goes on the Na Pali coast which is the North-west side of Kauai where it can only be reached by foot or touring by helicopter or seeing it from sea by boat.  I hiked 32 miles out of a possible 33 miles round trip.  It is some of the most beautiful scenery ever and some of the beaches along the way are only reachable by hiking there, it is a serious hike, one of the best in the world, it changed my life.   Day 1 – 20 Miles  The alarm went off at 4:45am and after a shower and packing or stuff in the car, me and Thomas drove up to the North Shore where we parked our car at a campsite a mile from where the hike starts.  One mile to the hike itself, got on the hike about 7am.  The first mile in was pretty much all uphill  a few switchbacks but I had plenty of energy right off the bat so it was pretty easy.  Next mile was pretty much downhill and not too bad.  At the 2 mile marker there is a nice little beach (Hanakapiai Beach) which is really bad ass, but horrible for swimming because the current is so bad.  There is a hike to the side here to a set of waterfalls, rightly named Hanakapiai Falls, it was 2 miles in, 2 miles out, first mile easy, 2nd was a little rocky, but not too bad, nice waterfalls.  I fell in the stream, right before the hike to the waterfalls getting my shoes and socks nice and wet.  I fell in another stream on the way to the falls, and Thomas fell in one on the way back, off to a great start.  The hiking boots I bought, and you NEED hiking boots, were a size 14, a size to small for me, so by the time we were heading back from the falls – about 6 miles in, the blisters had already started.  Back from the falls we had 4 miles to the next camping point which had been closed due to Malaria, but it wasn’t that bad when we went.  Those 4 miles weren’t too terribly tough.  A lot of switchbacks and some elevation change but great views of the coast the entire way down, we ducked in and out of the forest and being on the side of the cliff, some bamboo forests, eventually arriving at Hanakoa.  There is a short little half a mile hike here to the side to see a set of waterfalls which is supposedly nicer than the first which we opted to skip the first day and we were going to hit it on the way back but I was never able to find it.  We stopped here for about half an hour, having a dip in the stream, and a little bit of lunch – bread.  The next bit of the hike was 4 miles again, and described by all books as the most difficult.  In all honesty, it was exhausting, but I don’t know if I thought it was the toughest part.  The worst thing about it was having shoes that didn’t fit so well and numerous blisters starting, and when I say blisters, it was like someone cut off the back part of my heel, pretty rough.  There was one set of switchbacks all going up hill, probably 3 miles into that portion where I thought it might never end.  It was really strenuous for about 30 minutes, it seemed like a lot more, but was probably a lot less, but was richly rewarded with a brilliant view of the coast at the top.  These 4 miles were really cool though, most of it was out in the open on the side of the mountain, sometimes we had to grip the wall and go sideways the path got so narrow and the drop offs were so high, but the views were indescribable, just absolutely breathtaking.  This part of the trail was also quite dry, but the ocean was a perfect aquamarine, blueish, can’t even describe it, the pictures won’t do it enough justice, you have to see it to believe it.  Eventually we got to the 10 mile marker, which for us had been 15 miles and we ended at Kalalau stream.  The last mile or so we had some naked people hiking behind us, and we saw loads of goats.  At the end there were goats everywhere!  I also saw my first centipede, maybe a millipede on the hike.  At the stream, we took another hike 2 miles in to this big pool located in the stream.  It was cool, but as exhausted as I was and as late in the day as it was, it wasn’t worth it for 4 miles round trip.  The last mile to the beach was absolutely mad.  It was all down hill on slippery gravel and odd shaped ground, plenty of place to lose your footing and screw up your feet, which I did.  You could see the beach the whole way down, but I swear it wasn’t getting any closer.  Eventually I got there and it was spectacular.  The beach was almost completely isolated, there were people camping there but I didn’t see many.  Maybe 5 or 6 couples, 20 people total?  The sand was so powdery I would sink down when I stepped in it, there was a waterfall at one end of the beach where fresh water was available.  The water was crystal blue and sandy on the bottom.  I caught sunset that day too which was a gorgeous redish pink that filled all the clouds with all sorts of shades and made the beach almost glow.  I slept on the beach that night, and although I slept pretty badly, the scenery was great.  Towering green cliffs in the background, beautiful beaches all around, and millions of stars shining so bright it would light up the beach.  Dinner was beef jerky, goldfish, and protein bars.     Day 2 – 9 miles  The next morning we swam in the water for a bit, and thought about going to this other beach – Honopu which the only way to get there is by doing this hike, then swimming around the bend to get there.  I am pretty damn confident in my swimming, but the current was bad, and I certainly didn’t want to kill myself, so I left it alone, maybe for another day.  Got back on the road about 11am, and just about died the first mile.  All up hill, the sun hitting my back my backpack filled with almost 5 liters of water, plus equipment, it was mentally and physically grueling.  Obviously since I am writing this, I made it, but I’m not quite sure how.  The rest of the day would be like that, just shy of torture, with the most beautiful background imaginable.  There would be 2 more switchbacks uphill the rest of the day that were about as tough as this one, and we took our time, sweat a ton, drank loads of water, and made it back to the 2 mile marker right after sunset leaving us 3 miles for the next day.  Let me tell you about that night on the beach, one of the worst nights, ever.  Fell asleep after some more beef jerky and goldfish and sourdough bread about 8pm.  Sometime in the night, about 10 or 11 it started drizzling rain.  That kind of sucked because we were on the beach, though over a little sand dune, but only in sleeping bags.  We covered our bags so they wouldn’t get wet, then tried to cover up with a poncho a little bit.  The rain let up eventually and I went back to sleep, about 1:30ish, high tide came and wiped out all the tents on the beach filling them with water and soaking all sorts of people, it was quite bad, it got us a little, but nothing too bad… yet.  About 3, another set of huge waves came and this time just ripped right through us, soaking Thomas completely and his sleeping bag.  I got it pretty good, getting my sleeping bag soaked and the sleeves on the shirt, the rest of me was dry, though.  Wet, sandy, a bit cold, and pretty tired, we did our best, as did others on the beach, do fix things up a bit and try and lay some stuff out to dry.  Right as we were finishing, about 4am, the rain starts in again, this time going pretty good.  It rained pretty much nonstop and we sat huddled in our ponchos, until sunrise about 6:30am.  And just as the sun came up, the rain stopped.   Day 3 – 3 miles  Only 2 miles on the trail, which was pretty muddy, and though everyone says don’t hike it when it’s muddy, we had to, and we saw plenty of other people that were too – morons.  It was dangerous, and hurt the hell out of our feet, but eventually we made it, and I have never seen a parking lot look better.  The mile walk back to the car kind of sucked, and after getting to Old Blue (our car) I threw those hiking boots away.  I felt kind of like Kevin Costner in “Dances with Wolves” when at the beginning he has to have the boots cut off his feet, it was pretty bad.  After getting in the car we drove to Safeway to hit up the first aid section, then off to a local beach to clean up, shower, and boy did I smell, brush my teeth, etc.  After that it was on to McDonalds to load up on trash food, my first meal in about 2 ½ days.  Then we headed back to the hostel we were staying at before, dried some stuff out, rested a bit, and repacked our bags, then went off to the airport, caught the end of the World Series (happy to see the Yankees lose) and then back home to good ol’ Honolulu.     *Some side notes about the hike*    The Good:  You will get spectacular views, you will visit beaches that no one else can get to unless they go through what you do.  You will get to experience things that you can experience no where else.   The Bad:   It’s a rough hike, it’s no messing around, and you will hurt during and when you finish.  We heard stories of people faking injuries to get helicopter lifted off the coast, people crying, and others, I believe them all.  It will bring you as far as you’ve ever gone physically and mentally.  I would like to think that I am in pretty good shape, and it was still rough on me – though my hiking boots didn’t help.   Things you should know before you do the hike:   Stretch every day before and during the hike, stretch a lot, stretch all your leg, back, hip, etc. muscles.  I stretched, and it saved me.  Bring loads of water, but also bring iodine tablets to purify stream water, we did, and it was great.  Bring insect repellant, we did, and had no problems.  Bring a tent!  Take about 4 or 5 days to do the hike, don’t try and do all the side trips in one day, you’ll hurt yourself too bad, I’ll take a picture of our feet if you don’t believe me.  Most importantly, get a pair of hiking boots before you do it, the most comfortable pair, and wear them for a month before you go, and don’t fall in the river on the way there – but bring extra socks too.     THE BOTTOM LINE:   This hike changed my life.  For every time I got second place in a swim meet, for every calculus test I didn’t pass, for every girl I spent too much time on, or not enough time on, for every time I didn’t play piano well enough, none of those matter anymore.  Nothing has ever brought be a better sense of accomplishment than this hike, and I think it will be the same for anyone else.  I grew up a couple years on the hike, lost a couple pounds, but nothing has ever changed my life like this.  I can’t describe the feeling that I have in words, but I can go to bed every night thinking, “Well, at least I hiked the Na Pali coast.”  Would I recommend it to anyone else?  Maybe.  That’s a tough question.  You better be in good shape, and prepare yourself for the worst because it’s going to hurt you mentally and physically, probably like you’ve never been hurt before.  I always weigh hikes in how tough it was, and was the pay off worth it.  The pay off was well worth it, I don’t regret one step I took.  Would I do the hike again?  Maybe.  I’d love to go to that beach at the end that you have to swim to, and it’s quite a bonding experience.  I’d probably do the hike again with the same people that I would recommend it too.  If you’re a whiner, or going to complain, don’t even think about going on the hike.  Off the top of my head, I’d tell my Dad, Keith, and Andy Pace to do it, maybe Robby.  This hike had a huge impact on me, it was one of, if not the best thing I have ever done in/with my life.  I could’ve cried at the end of the hike because I was so happy to have done it, so happy to be finished, so happy to have been part of the Na Pali coast.

      Took an easy day of driving around, checked out Wailua waterfalls, Kipu waterfalls, and then hung out on Lydgate beach the rest of the day.

      Started the day by getting camping permits to stay at Na Pali – 10 bucks per night, pretty pricey for a beach you have to walk 11 miles to!  Hung out on Poipu beach all day and swam and tanned.  Got a call from this lady at Adecco that said the company (Inets – www.inets.com) that I interviewed with before wanted me to come back for another interview.  I told her that I wouldn’t be able to get back until Monday, so it looks like I will be interviewing again.  The job sounds pretty cool, though I don’t know everything about it.  It is direct hire, and it something along the lines of driving along the island all day and fixing clients computers, not sure who the client is yet though, sounds pretty sweet though.  Ate at Taqueria Nortenos which was some cheap ass Mexican food, then for dinner we ate at Roys.  Roys is crazy expensive, but the food is just some of the best, and after living off hot dogs and ramen noodles and other cheap food for so long, it was just heavenly.  I don’t even really like sweet food, but I had the signature “death by chocolate” dessert and it was pretty damn good.

      Started the morning out by going to Moloa’a beach towards the north shore on Kauai.  It was a decent beach, not too many people on it, but it was overcast, and too many waves for snorkeling.  Headed to the very top of the island and went to his cave that is underwater that is called the “Blue Room”.  There is a little opening at the top of the cave where you enter, then you climb down some rocks and there is an underwater natural spring water pool for you to swim in.  Sometimes the way the sun enters the room and reflects off the pool and the roof of the cave it gives the entire a cave a blue tint to it.  It was ok while we were there, but the water level was a little low so it wasn’t as great, still pretty cool though.  After that we checked out Ke’e beach which is at the top of the island and also the start of the Na Pali coast trail.  Stayed out there and soaked up some rays for a while.  On the way back down we checked out this other place that’s kinda hard to find called the “Queens Bath”.  It’s on the North shore still but weathering from the water has created a nice little pool in the middle of some lava rocks, and it replenishes itself with sea water when the waves come in.  There is decent snorkeling there when the waves aren’t too crazy, which while we were there, they were.  Headed back to the town of Lihue to have some more Saimin for a late lunch.  Hey!  I told you it was good!

      Started the morning out with kayaking down the Wailua River which is on the East side of Kauai.  It is a good time, I had done it when I was here at the millennium with my family.  This time it was just me and Thomas each in our own kayak.  We kayaked down to a bend where you can go to the right and do a nice short 30 minute hike to a decent set of waterfalls.  It’s pretty cool, but seems to have gotten too touristy, but it was a Saturday morning though.  After that we got back on the river and kayaked a little further down to the Fern Grotto which is just basically a really nice park with great plant life.  Came back to the hostel for a little after that, then headed to the South side of the island.  We went to Poipu beach just for a little, then checked out Spouting Horn which is a whole in the ground where waves will crash through it and make it look like water is shooting like a blowhole in a whale, pretty sweet.  After that we did a drive up to Waimea Canyon lookout.  Waimea Canyon is the Grand Canyon of the Pacific.  It looks just like that too, my pictures didn’t turn out so great, but we got there at sunset so it was a little dark, but still pretty nice.  We could still see the forbidden island of Ni’ihau which is an island off the coast of Kauai that no one is allowed to visit.  Only the couple hundred people that live there are allowed to go there.  Afterwards we hit a local brewpub in the city of Waimea and headed back home.    p.s. Happy Birthday to Kenna!

      Started the day out by getting some stuff at the one Walmart on the island for the Na Pali coast hike.  After that, me and Thomas attempted to do what sounded like this awesome secret tunnels hike.  You hike about 2 miles to these old abandoned tunnels, then through the tunnels to some waterfalls and stuff.  Well, we were planning on doing the Na Pali coast hike tomorrow, so we didn’t want to screw up our only pair of shoes, and they don’t sell hiking boots on the island, so we talked to a local and they said that it wouldn’t be a big deal to go in sandals, or barefoot.  Well it took a bit of maneuvering just to get to the hike, we had to go on some dirt roads and do go off roading a bit, but we made it.  About 1 minute into the hike we were covered in mud and losing our sandles.  We decided to go without the sandles.  We hiked for two hours, some of the time, up to our knees in mud (check out the pictures).  We eventually saw some people who said we had a ways left to go and at that point we realized if we finished the hike, we weren’t going to make it back before sunset.  So reluctantly, we took a little dip in a river near by, then trekked our asses back through the nasty mud and thorns and rock back to the car, having not seen the tunnels, having not finished the hike.  We were quite thankful that neither of us hurt our feet worse than we did.  Lots of nice cuts on them and all over our arms, but nothing broken, and nothing serious.  I don’t recommend this hike to anyone.  I love hikes.  I love the challenge, and the reward, and the toughness of them.  The only reason I will do this one again is to say I did it, to see the tunnels, and to show it who’s boss.  If you ever do this hike, wear good hiking boots and be prepared for the muddiest hike of your life.  We did get to check out Opeka’a Falls on the way to the hike which had some good views of the Wailua River also though.

      Went to Kauai in the morning.  Getting to Kauai was great, it was easy to remember some of the things and how great this place is.  Me and Thomas rented a p.o.s. car and went strait to a sports bar to catch game 7 of the playoffs, Red Sox vs. Yankees.  I hate the Yankees!  After that disappointing loss, we went and ate Saimin at Hamura’s Saimin.  Saimin is basically a really good Ramen Noodles with some pork and fish cakes added in and you can get these chicken and steak kabobs for a buck each.  It’s cheap, good, local, and filling.

      Sorry for so long with no updates.  I added all my updates to the blog today, and I am slowly getting the pictures from Maui on.  THERE ARE 2 PAGES OF PICTURES NOW!  So make sure that you go to both because most of the new ones are on the second page.  I got an email from some people on Oahu yesterday and I had to come back to Oahu to do an interview in Honolulu so I am staying at the hostel in Honolulu for 2 days and I got a chance to upload everything, still hoping to be out to Kauai for a week, or at least thats the plan, but it was good to be back on Oahu, kinda felt like I was coming home.  Still some people that I know at the hostel and I got to room with one of my old room mates Adam who is pretty cool and is working on getting some kinda connection for finding a place to live!  Anyways check out all the new pics.  There's some new ones in the Misc. section, the 4 Maui sections, and Oahu Pearl Harbor and Oahu North Shore.  Aloha!

      I’ll be on Maui for three more days, but yesterday was definitely a sign that it was time to go.  We went to the nude beach again today, but first we were on the other side, it’s a two sided beach.  We played a little volleyball, and swam in the ocean for a while because there were some monstrous waves, got those on video too.  Went to the nude beach for a little bit and then drove home.  We caught a ride home with this guy from the hostel and right before we got to the hostel which is in the ghetto, we passed the government housing and there was a huge fight going on outside.  There were probably about 10 or so individual fights going on and everyone was slowing down.  The driver decided to turn around and when he did the fight started spilling into the street and a guy got pushed into the side of the car, or he may have been trying to jump on the car so we could get him out of there because he was getting beat pretty bad.  We weren’t about to stop and the cops weren’t there so we kept going, the guy was still getting beat up behind us.  Once we heard the cops coming we went back, and the cops had to get a statement from us and everything, it was a huge mess.  After that we went back to the hostel and had a few beers and then some people at the hostel almost got into a fight, but one of them left in the morning.  Lots of drama, and all I want to do is sit on the beach.  Too top things off, there is a community kitchen, and the food we keep buying keeps magically disappearing, staffs probably taking it.  But we’re outta here soon enough, onto Kauai, and onto the Na Pali coast, in the mean time, I’m gonna sit on the hammock and read some books, maybe watch a little tv, and play a little scrabble.

      Internet access is hard to come by on Maui.  I am doing lots of cool stuff seeing lots of cool things.  I have been taking tons of photos and typing up the blog and I will add the blog updates and photos just as soon as I get a chance!  Mahalo!

      Went to Lahina which is the big tourist town on Maui.  It was a cool little town, had lots of shops and hotels and what not, definitely a tourists dream place.  The beach there was pretty cool too and we got to jump from one of the cliffs into the ocean and also do a little snorkeling.  The next day we walked about 20-30 minutes through a dried out lava field to this nice little spot commonly called the fishbowl and went snorkeling there.  Because of the lava, there was lots of cool coral life and fish and what not.  If it weren’t for the damn hangover I had it would have been a lot better.  In hostels it seems that there’s always a party because it’s always somebody’s last night, and the common toast is, “To people like us!”

      Started this morning a little early and took a trip on the famous Road to Hana.  It is a 37 mile winding road along the coast with some nice scenery and some waterfalls along the way.  It is a narrow road and the speed limit is pretty slow, so it takes some time to get there, but if you wake up early and give yourself plenty of time it is well worth it.  We stopped at a little pullover in Hana to get some fish on a stick, which was quite fabulous, they also have some fresh fruits and other souvenirs there.  After that we headed for some red sand beaches next to a school and a baseball field in Hana.  The beach was really nice and had some nice views, plus it’s kind of cool to see red sand, we did encounter a little bit of rain which is kind of normal for that side of the island.  Next we headed up the road a little further to a national park where the 7 sacred pools are.  This is quite a famous attraction.  The name is a little misleading as there are not exactly 7 pools, and all the water in Hawaii is sacred, but it is a beautiful place none the less.  If you go down to some of the pools towards the ocean it is very touristy, but you can get your pictures or whatever you want.  We opted to go away from the shore and take a nice hike, probably about 4 miles to a beautiful water fall in the middle of the jungle.  The hike to the falls was nice because you see some more of the sacred pools on the way as well as hike through a very nice bamboo forest.  On the way back we took a swim in some of the pools and swam upstream a little bit where we did some cliff jumping into the water and some people swung from some vines.  It was pretty cool.  Lastly we hit up some black sand beaches and caves.  There are some small fresh water caves to one side of the park and at the other side at the ocean is the black sand beach.  Again, it was a little rainy, but still made for a nice day, the beaches were really nice and quite a spectacular view, as the pictures will show.

      Went on a short little hike today, about 4 miles round trip.  Most of it was through rainforest type atmosphere, and about half way through you have to cross these two swinging bridges, kinda like in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.  It was pretty interesting, a little bit scary.  At the end of the hike you get to a nice little man made damn where there is fresh water falling off making a little waterfall that you can drink out of it is so fresh.  Off to the side there is a nice little cliff you can jump off of into the water which was cool, and all around you there is fresh guava that you can eat from the trees!  Quite a nice day.

      This is the kind of day that really makes you laugh and think, “Wow!  What a cool experience!”  While I could certainly never live in Maui, it is definitely a very cool place to visit and vacation at.  I started the day by going with the tour at the hostel to the “Big Beach” in Makena which was a nice beach with very clear water and some decent waves breaking at shore.  We played a little beach volleyball for a while and I did a little bit of snorkeling.  Getting towards sunset we climbed over this little cliff and walked down a little ridge to a nude beach.  It was quite interesting, my first nude beach.  There were definitely more naked guys than girls, but not all old farts either.  It took a little to get used to, but one of the guys that works at the hostel I’m staying at brought some beer and we had a few beers and a few laughs.  What makes this place so great is that the people that were at the beach were really big hippies for the most part.  I mean it was really a lot of leftovers from Woodstock it looked like.  They were naked and smoking some pot and a lot of people had bongos and were playing those while other people danced, quite interesting.  When the sun sets at this beach it hits a couple of other islands, some small one, Lanai, and Molokai, and another one.  After the sunset all the hippies playing on drums keep playing but then people on the beach start twirling fire.  One guy in particular was really awesome, he was twirling fire on a stick and then on a rope, it was pretty awesome, got some good pictures, and even video of one person.  Then we got a ride home with someone who didn’t even know our names, but lives at the hostel also, quite a night, one for the books.  Also found out that hitch hiking on Maui is fairly common.

      Went on a 12 mile hike through this volcano on Maui.  It was quite a rough hike.  Went downhill for 4 miles, across for 4, and then a lot of switchbacks going up about 1500 feet for the last 4 miles.  Not too bad for me, though I had a bit of a head cold, but a lot of people were having a rough time and were very thankful to see the end of the hike.  At some points in the hike it was so desolate it seemed like we were on the moon with black sand and rocks and nothings else, very cool though.  I am taking pictures of all our hikes, but internet access at the hostel is a little hard to come by, so I will just upload them when I can, along with all the other ones I have waiting.  Met some people from Switzerland, Holland, and Bulgaria, hadn’t met people from there before.

      Got to Maui yesterday and the hostel is kinda crappy and it a shitty neighborhood, but the people here are very cool and the tours all over the island are awesome.  Our first tour we went to this mountain called the Iao Needle, the hike to it had fresh Guava on the trail that some people were eating.  Later we did a quick hike to this nice set of waterfalls and went swimming underneath them.

      Busses are off strike now on Oahu and were giving free rides for a week to try and get people to come back.  On my last day on Oahu me and Thomas (friend I met in Hawaii who is also from TX) went up to the North Shore on Oahu.  It was a hell of a lot of fun.  The waves were amazingly huge.  We went swimming in it as others did, but some waves you just have to duck under because they were big enough to hurt you.  I’d guess 7-10 ft. waves.  There was also a huge rock there that you can jump off of into the water, probably about 20-30 ft. high so we did that too and it was pretty awesome.  I’ll upload pics of it when I can.

      Well to those of you in the U.S. viewing this web page, Happy Thanksgiving.  Hope you all have a great day, eat lots of turkey, maybe watch a movie or two, spend some time with the family.  This is my first Thanksgiving away from home I'm sad to say, but we're making the best of it here.  Many other people here are in the same boat, and a few of us are going skydiving tomorrow morning, and then maybe grill some fish on the beach afterwards, and yes, the hostel is even making some turkey too.  A regular old holiday feast over here, plus Jack in the Box is open next door in case we get too hungry.  I'll post an update on the skydive when I get a chance.  Car and everything else is back in order.  They are showing movie on the beach all week long this week in case anyone wants to go.  Turkey for me and turkey for you, let's eat the turkey in a big brown shoe.

      You know I think since I've been out here I've done more waving goodbye and saying goodbye then I have in my entire life.  It's great meeting all kinds of new people, but everyone goes different directions and after you meet some people out here, have some laughs with them, trade some stories, you have to say goodbye, and it always sucks, wish you could take all the good people, put em in a jar and cary them all around.  I miss traveling already, fortunately traveling to other islands out here is quite easy and I have friends on other islands now too.  But always on the move, meeting different people all the time, seeing new things, learning new things, it's really an experience all to itself.  I wish that everyone would save up for a year or two and then go traveling around for a few months where ever they want and meet people, but get outta the states, go to Europe or Australia and New Zealand, lots of that going on over here, and it's just great to hear about, I fully expect it to be just a matter of time before I head out there, even just for a vacation.

      So now that I got this job, which don't get me wrong, I love it, I'm learning all kinds of new things, getting to get my hands in anything I want, but I have to settle down a little bit.  You know, little things, like getting a place to live, getting a cell phone, getting a car, getting insurance, blah blah blah, it's like there is no end in site.  And so then all those headaches come back with it, the car isn't working right, so I have to pay to get that fixed, the cell phone wasn't working at all, so i have to go hassle with them, car insurance was a snap, way to go Geico!  And that's what sucks the most is having to deal with "crap" for lack of a better word.  Just little things, annoiances (sp.)  The flipside to this coin, and what really keeps me from being upset at all about it, is there are some huge ass waves just waiting for me to go swim in just as soon as I get off work, then there are drinks to be had at the hostel and people to meet.

      I just signed up for the Honolulu marathon here.  It is Dec. 14th, Sunday, and is a 26.2 mile run/walk event, 4th biggest in the world.  First biggest marathon is in London, then NY, then Boston, and then Honolulu.  Gonna warm up for it with a short little 5k the weekend before.  Looking forward to it even though I may be in a wheel chair the week after.  Just when my feet heal from the Na Pali Coast hike, I go and try to mess them up again.  Triple Crown Surf competition started here last week, it's like the world championships of surfing.  Surf is down right now but we are supposed to get some big swells pretty soon.

      I ate chickens feet for lunch last Friday.  It's the only thing that I knew I ate, everything else was a mystery.  I went with some Chinese people I work with to eat Dim Sum and they ordered everything in Chinese.  The chicken feet weren't bad, but I would certainly never crave them.  You rip off the individual toes and then suck of the skin and get the flavor from that.  Hmmm...

      Most of you know by now, but I've started getting a little more comfortable here, car, phone, mailing address, job, etc.  So all you people that were promising that visit... you better start looking at tickets.  My Uncle and Aunt will be here this weekend, and my old friend Mackie from Shell after that, then my sister and parents, where are the rest of ya'll?  On 1960?  Surfs good today, going after work.

I'm learning loads of stuff though which is awesome, and having lots and lots of fun.  I might even start teaching Microsoft courses at our training center!  yikes!

      Back in Honolulu again - home base.  Hope everyone has been able to get a chance to check out the pics - Kauai was spectacular - an absolute blast - I would love to stay there longer, but it's easy enough to get over there from here, and all the work is on Oahu.  Speaking of, I came back for an interview with Inets - www.inets.com and on Wednesday, they offered me the position.  My official title is Level II Tech Support Engineer.  Basically this company has a whole bunch of other clients, banks, clothing, etc.  And I will go to their clients and fix whatever they need fixed.  It should be a good job to meet people, see some more of the island, learn some more about the island, plus I should get the chance to do some inner island travel for work also which will be cool.  I start Monday at 8am.  Also had Halloween last night - a huge thing in Hawaii.  On Maui, in the main tourist town of Lahina, they say that Halloween is the Mardi Gras of the South Pacific, expecting 35,000 people this year.  It was pretty crowded down here on Waikiki too though.  Did a little bit of drinking and then hung out in the streets and checked out peoples costumes and stuff, put a new section with some haloween pics on the site too, so check those out.  It was a good time... as usual.  One last note.  A couple of people have said to me recently when asking how Hawaii is - "You are so lucky".  IT'S NOT LUCK!  Just get off your ass and do it.  My dad gave me an article to read shortly before I left about this couple driving from somewhere in South America up to Alaska in a piece of shit car and not a whole lot of money.  What they said is right on the head, "the hardest part is just starting."  It's easy to do, it the best thing that I have done.  Whether I am here for another year, or 10, it's where I wanted to be, where I love being, and it wasn't that hard to do.  People have come out here with nothing and done something.  You don't have to go to Hawaii - if your dream is to live in Australia, or Europe, or Montana, get up and just do it.  You won't regret one step I promise.

      At work we just moved into one office, we had two offices before and we are moving into one location.  A local tradition here is to have your office blessed.  Whenever you move into a new building, you have a priest come and bless the location.  Pretty cool.  And after the blessing tomorrow, it's 4 1/2 days off!

      My folks arrived 2 days ago in Hawaii and it was great to see them.  We were fortunate to have some good weather the first day they were here and got to go to the beach right away.  They are letting me stay in one of the hotel rooms they got for my sister and them. It was the first time in 3 months that I spent the night in a room by myself.  Quite possibly the best night of sleep I ever had... besides the hostel guys calling me at 2:30am.  And it was nice not to have bed bugs too.  And then my sister arrived yesterday so all of us are here now which is great.  Although the elevator did break at the hotel so to get back to the room we had to climb 19 flights of stairs.  Good times.

      Went skydiving on Thanksgiving with my friends from Hawaii Adam and Alyssum.  It was awesome!  The view going up was spectacular, and at the top you could see almost the circumfrance of the entire island, it was goregous.  We went in some tiny cesna planes this time so we couldn't all go together, so I went first, then Adam and Alyssum went.  When we got to jumping altitude, the instructor had me swing my legs out the plane and let them dangle there, and then we rolled out.  We did a couple flips when we rolled out and then we we flattened out and did a couple helicopter spins, it was really cool.  After we pulled the chute, the rest of the way down was spectacular views, even though my legs hurt from the pull on the parachute.  After skydiving we went to a beach on the north shore for a little and then back to the South side of the island for a dip at the beach and a little bit of swimming.  Only had to work half a day the next day at work which was nice, but ended up getting sick after that, but it was raining all weekend long, even today too!  Sucks.  See, weather isn't always perfect in paradise... just most of the time.

      For the 2nd time in my life I am homeless.  I had to leave the 2nd hostel because you are only allowed to stay 2 weeks, I was there 3.  The good news is, I should be moving into a duplex with someone I work with tomorrow, so hopefully this is the last sliver of homelessness for a while.  The only thing I don't really mind about it is that I can cary everything I own on my back, or in the trunk of my car, so it's not that big of a deal.  I start Japanese classes this Saturday too so that'll be interesting.  I think I have also come to the realization that this isn't where I will stay indefinately.  Right now, a few people are planning on coming to visit me in the upcoming months (c00l!)  I also have a slight commitment to people at work.  But the more I thought about it, and after having finished this Neil Young biography, I feel even stronger about the "do whatever the hell makes you happy" idea.  Yeah I might piss some people off along the way, but you gotta make yourself happy first.  My job, while great for learning, is big time stress, I work probably about 60 hours a week now, and the pay just isn't worth it anymore.  I am thinking about taking up a 2nd job so I can save money, and come say Christmas time, cause I figure that's as good a time as any, I might be headin outta here.  Talking with my room mate last night, it looks like New Zealand is gonna be the next place.  Why the hell not right?  We'll see.  It strikes me as odd though, kinda funny.  I felt like I was stuck here this weekend, kinda like, what the hell am I gonna do.  Then I thought for a little while (long while) and remembered that there's nothing tying me down here, nothing I have to do.  And shit, I'm still enjoying Hawaii on the weekends.  Hoping to do another cool hike this coming weekend if I get some time.  But this girl room mate I had from Canada, great girl, friendly as hell.  She had been gone about 3 weeks and wanted to go back to Canada.  Makes me sad really.  By now she is in Australia and will be there the next 9 months.  I don't think it will be long before she realizes how much she loves it.  And even if she doesn't, you know how much she'll get out of it, how much experience she will get and how much she will grow?!?!  Unbelivable.  So those of you sitting at home tired of the same ol shit, go out and get a second job, or shit hitchhike across the U.S. to wherever you wanna live.  How cool would that be???  I think I might do that sometime.  Hitch hike to TX from California.  What a story!  You're not stuck wherever you are, you can pack your stuff, and just leave.  Do whatever you think is right, I bet you'll find the right direction.  I think my new modo is "just wing it."

      You always miss certain things when you leave a place you've lived at, or even just visited.  From Florida, I miss the college campus and the apartment I lived in, I miss Miami subs.  From Houston I miss baseball games already, beef fajita nachos from taco cabana.  And what I found myself missing a lot recently, carpet.  The feel of carpet on your feet and not cold wet tile with sand all over it.  Oh what I'd give for a little bit of carpet.  ;-)

      The New Year has already brought new things for me.  To make the long story short and sweet, I am living in a new hostel, not as nice as the old one, and I only have two weeks in which to stay here, but that's ok as it will force my ass to find an apartment.  Work has started off very good too.  We are quite busy, but it's fun, and learning lots.  I also got some japanese books for christmas and today just signed up for Japanese class at University of Hawaii here so I am looking forward to that.  Weather is cool at night now, almost enough for a jacket.  Other than that things are good, hoping to find a place soon and start taking classes, and getting back to the beach more and maybe a few more hikes!

      Sorry no updates in a while.  I just got my journal updated last night.  My parents and sisters trip here was a blast.  They got to spend some quality time at the beach and got in some good snorkeling.  Me and my folks hiked Diamond head and another hike called the Makiki Tantulus hike, which we managed to get lost and rained on, but, it was still a very nice hike.  One day we all went to Lilikani beach by Kailua beach where I went windsurfing on the Windward (east) side of the island.  It's a great beach, crystal blue water, powdery sand, and little islands out in the water, makes it look a bit like a Carribean post card.  We ate at some nice restaurants, Dukes, Roys, some good Sushi places.  Got to see the new movie with Jack Nicholas and Diane Keaton, and Keanu Reeves, also got to see Last Samurai and Lord of the Rings 3, all of which I thought were great.  Hit up New Years and heard some group play some Beatles songs and also got to see the fireworks on Waikiki.  It was a great time, I was sad to see them go, made me miss Texas a little bit.  But I'd rather be laying on the beach here than the street of 1960.

      Been going out to Lanakai beach on the east side of the island a lot recently.  I was out there earlier this morning and the lifeguard came by to post up sharks sighted signs... just after I got out of the water.  Tiger sharks too I think they were saying.  No worries though, they said it had been the first time a sign like that was put up there in something like 15 years, so hopefully it'll be another 15 years before it happens again.  I also hiked this mountain just behind Lanakai beach too and got some great views and some great pics.  I have quite a few pics to upload... just as soon as I find that password.

      I thought I put the update in here, but I guess I didn't.  I did move into a place finally.  I am living in downtown Honolulu with someone I work with.  It's a 3 bedroom duplex, nothing special, close to work, and close to the highway to my favorite beach.  Yesterday I passed my upgrade exam for my MCSA (Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator) under Windows 2003.  Also, I've been taking some Japanese classes, those have been interesting.  Rest of the time, just been hanging out at the beach, most of the time, Lanaki beach.  It's pretty bad ass.

      It's the coldest here now than it has been since I've been here.  Getting to almost 68 at night.  Whew!  And a steady breeze too.  Can barely make it!  ;-)  Things are going good here in Hawaii.  Been trying to fix ol Blue's (my car's) radio.  Hitting the beach and hanging out.  Hope everything is good with everyone else.

      The past week I've been working on some computers here for our classrooms at work because we do training.  We require different O.S. and application combinations and each time there is a new class our instructor has to reload the operating system, requiring lots of man hours (or women hours in this case).  So to simplify this process I decided to make each of these combinations on the computer and created what is called an image so that you can basically push a few buttons and let it go and VOILA!  you have everything done in a matter of minutes.  So after doing this for about a week, I have just a few hours left before I am completely done and the hard drive dies, completely crashes, completely kills an entire weeks worth of work.  Just spectacular.  I work with this guy Curtis who has the absolute worst luck I have ever seen, I do believe it's starting to run off on me.  DANG IT!  Best day ever.  Ahhh, well tomorrow is Friday, tonight is Thirsty Thursday, and I have nothing to do all weekend 'cept sit on the beach and veg out.  Shoots.

      Lots of stuff going on at work, lost some people, added some people, still keeping very busy, but they gave me a raise which was nice, makes work just a little bit better.  I competed, or maybe I should say completed a biathlon today in Waikiki.  Been a while since I've done anything like that.  It was a 5k run (3.2 miles) and a 1k swim (about .75 miles).  The run was pretty tough for me, I've always been a crappy runner, but I did it without stopping which was my goal, but I got killed by a lot of other runners, however on the swim I kicked some but and caught up with and beat a lot of people there so that was good.  It was pretty cool doing the swim because your competing in this race but all these cool fish are swimming around you at the same time too.  Anyways, it was pretty exahusting, but well worth it, there was an 81 year old woman doing the biathlon too!  Pretty sweet.  I'm starting a paddeling club which is the Hawaiian looking canoes, basically a canoe with another attachment on the side.  5 men row in it, or at least I think it's 5, and I heard they party pretty hard too.  Starts pretty soon I think, more details to follow soon.

      One month till Heather and her friends come, Andy Pace is talking about coming in late June, where's everyone else at?  It's been really great here recently, great weather, havin some fun.  I got to go to Maui a couple times for work, didn't get to spend much time hanging out though.  I'm doing a food drive and another biathlon this weekend so that should be fun.  Peeling right now from a bit of too much sun.  Hope everything is going well with everyone else.

      I I found out today that my Great Grandfather - Grandpa Weinstock passed away today, he was 91 years old.  Always a funny guy, he loved baseball, and said his secret to long life was smoking cigars and drinking "good ones".  It's too bad really.  On a lighter note, it's time for me to move again, I can already feel the headache coming on, I hope that I don't have such a problem as last time, but I think it should be a little easier.  Getting hot here now too, gotta try and hit the beach this weekend!

      Sorry ya'll.  Been busy.  Last weekend I went and did a food drive with work which was actually a lot of fun.  It was amazing the way the community came together and showed their support, just the entire island participated in this food drive in one way or another for the most part, really cool.  Last Sunday I ran another biathlon.  This one was a 2.8 mile run and a 800m swim.  I convinced a Level III technician that I work with to race against me so that was fun.  Actually, he told me that he could beat me, so it was more like a made him race me.  But it was fun, we got the office to bet money on us and the winner ended up getting like 50 bucks.  I won the race and this lady Mary at work won the pool.  It was cool though, pictures are up for that already.  Not much else been going on.  Been getting to the beach a fair amount again.  Weather is getting hot again now too.  Heather is coming in a few weeks, and Andy comes in late June and is gonng be here for at least 2 months, got his ticket out here officialy now, gonna be pretty damn sweet.

      Andy made it to Hawaii.  Where's everyone else?  Actually, some of my family is coming out later in July on Kauai and I'm gonna go meet up with them, and then my parents are talking about coming out again at Xmas so that'll be sweet.  Had a good time Andy's first weekend out here, we checked out Waimea Bay and jumped off the big ass rock again out there, then ate at Cholos mexican restaurant there.  Hit up Duke's, went to swim in Waikiki, saw some prostitutes cruisin the street.  Went to Magoos, swam out to Chinaman's hat and then hiked to the top.  Went to Mai Thai bar last night.  You know just another crappy weekend in paradise, but hey, you gotta be somewhere.

      Ate some fried green tomatoes, and had some spam finally.  The tomatoes were good, the spam wasn't that good.  Went to taste of Honolulu last weekend with Andy which was pretty good too.

      Got my wisdom taken out yesterday.  It hurt like hell.  Evidentally I only had 3 - never grew a fourth, the one top one was easy to take out.  My two bottom ones were growing in sideways and they had to cut them in half and cut around the nerves.  Oh man did it feel great.  They kept giving me shots in the mouth too so that by the end I couldnt feel my face, and I couldnt feel it the rest of the night.  But they gave me some meds to knock me out, so after the swelling and bleeding stopped and I got to sleep, it wasn't TOO bad.  Today was a little rough - eating lots of mash potatoes which are good, and getting some little crap done that I needed to do on the computers.  Thats about all.  Don't get yours taken out unless you have to.  My teeth are Pau (Hawaiian for finished)

      Last week at work I had to jet out to the Big Island (called just Hawaii) for the day.  It was pretty sweet.  I hadn't been there before, and it is the biggest of all islands with a volcano still active.  Unfortunately I didn't have time to go see any much of the island, but it was nice to take a quick little trip, but then this past weekend I was able to go to Maui too which was awesome.  I had been there before, but got to hit up some of the good spots still including a black and red sand beach and jumping off a cliff again.  But what I am REALLY looking forward to is getting my wisdom teeth pulled this friday, and then getting measured for a tux for Kennas wedding after that.  And lastly, only about one more week before Andy makes his way out here so that will be nice.  And next month I am going to Kauai for the weekend to visit my great Uncle George and Aunt Marry and all their kids and grand kids.  Thomas L. - if you still read the blog - first thing I am going to do is finish that damn muddy "secret tunnels" hike on Kauai.  I'll take a picture of the end for you.

      One of the important things about Hawaii is Aloha.  Aloha as most know it is hello and goodbye.  But it is also a way of life out here and actually means love.  The Aloha spirit is showing some love for your neighbor.  For example.  When the girls were here recently and we went kayaking, you have to cross a road that has a fair amount of traffic coming by, I told one of the girls, Jamie, wait - someone will show us the Aloha spirit.  Seconds later someone stopped and waived us by.  When the girls came out here and I had nothing in my new apartment, they all pitched in and let me borrow so much stuff.  The aloha spirit.  Live and well.  Also, there is a rumor on Hawaii that if you remove lava rock, or as I heard it, also black sand, from the island, that bad luck will come your way.  Well when I went kayaking recnetly to a smaller island I took a small rock from there, not lava rock, but as soon as we got back from the trip I lost my wallet.  A few other bad things happened since then so I made a return kayak trip to the island this past weekend to return the rock.  Just a few hours after returning the rock, I went to the post office and checked my mail, and low and behold, someone had returned my wallet, everything except the cash.  Bottom line, all is sacred, do not take anything from the islands.  I learned the hard way.  Yikes!  Live and learn.

      Got some more visitors this past 2 weeks.  Heather, Jamie, and Jo Jo from San Antonio Texas came out to visit for almost 2 weeks.  They stayed with me the entire time and I took som vacation time off work to hang out with them.  Actually got to do a lot of great stuff.  Hiked a lot, Maunawili Falls, and Stairway to Heaven, and Diamond Head.  I didn't finish Stairway cause the heights were a bit much, but Jamie and Heather did and I was mad impressed with that.  Kayaked to the Mokes (some islands off the Windward Side).  Had a guided tour at the Dole Plantation (this was the low point), went parasailing, went to a Luau, went snorkeling, surfing, and hanging at the beach, ate some good food, and had some good drink.  A really great time.  It was great to see some people from Texas and have some fun, and while everyone is thinking 3 girls for 2 weeks would be a mess, we actually had a lot of fun.  Do you like boats?

      Well so I was homeless again.  For about a week this time.  How facinating!  You know I was really fortunate to have the support of so many friends and co-workers out here that saved my butt so that I didn't have to sleep out on the street.  If it were not for them, I am not sure what would have happened.  My old room mate screwed me over by him not paying rent and so we got kicked out two weeks earlier than expected, and as it turned out I scored this great place one day before the girls came out to visit me.  I actually walked by the place one day and thought, dang, that would be a sweet place to live.  As it turns out, a friend of mine new someone that stayed here, and then they found out there was an apartment for rent.  And I jumped on it right quick.  It's a studio, but pretty big with 2 rooms, bathroom, kitchen, washer and dryer, and a little lanai (balcony) on the 34th floor with an awesome view of waikiki, diamond head, and the ocean.  And it's about 1 mile one way to a bar, and about 2 miles the other way to work.  Holler!

      Woke up fell out a bed, dragged a comb across my head, found my way downstairs... wait that's a Beatles song. No, just woke up, went to Luling City BBQ with the folks, which was freakin awesome! Got ready for Kennas wedding and went down to Spring to pick up Heather and Amanda's friend who've I've forgotten his name already. Well the wedding was great. Shit I was nervous for Matt and Kenna. I was fortunate enough to get to stand up for the wedding and it was just a really great thing. Good for them. After the wedding we went to the reception which was great, got to see a lot of people that I hadn't seen in a while, Nina, Julie, Arf, and spend time with all my other friends. Honestly, I was the best dancer there. I headed up both Conga Lines, and well seriously, who dances better than a 6ft 6 white guy. After the reception we went to Fox and Hound in the Woodlands for a little and then called it a night.

      Woke up a little late and had lunch with my folks at Cabo's downtown.  Hung out at the house for a little bit and then went down and visited Heather's folks in Spring and then we went to the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for Kenna's wedding.  The rehearsal went fine and the dinner was at cafe adobe.  It was good to see a lot of my old friends, and more importantly to eat some good mexican again.  Holler!

      Well it had been 11 months, almost to the day... my text looks weird... but anyways, after about a 7 hour plane ride, I arrived into the nice muggy town of Houston.  My mom picked me up from the airport and I got to go back to this tiny little shack they live in now.  Took a little nap to get back on Texas time and then me and my folks and Heather went to an Astros game.  They got their clocks cleaned, but it was still fun to go.  Afterwards I got to go get some good mexican food finally at El Tiempo.  Picked up my tux for Kennas wedding on the way there.  Hung out around the house for a little bit afterwards and then went down to Spring to hang out with all the guys down there.  It was good times and it was like I hadn't even missed a beat.

      Long ass week at work.  We are doing a domain consolidation project for all the YMCA sites on the isalnd.  It went pretty bad - worked about 70hours this week, too many clients and not enough employees.  Aren't I supposed to be lying on the beach?

      Went to the blue room which is on the north shore of Kauai and is this under ground cave that when the sun shines in and off the water and ceiling it turns the room blue which is pretty sweet.  After that we went to Ke'e beach for a little bit, and then we went to hike the first mile or so of the Na Pali coast or Kalalau trail on Kauai which was cool, reminded me of traveling again.  Ate lunch back with the relatives, then me and Andy drove and saw spouting horn and then went and drove all the way up to Waimea Canyon which I believe is the Grand Canyon of the South Pacific.  Pretty cool day.

      Man, I've been horrible about updates, but I have been super busy, Andy was yelling at me to update, and I need to update this, and my journal, and my pictures.  So anyways, yeah about three weeks ago I went to Kauai with Andy and got to visit my Great Aunt and Uncle and my dad's cousins which was cool.   The first day that we got there, we took a this hike, which for me, was the second time, the "Secret Tunnels Hike".  It's this hike that goes through just a crap load of mud and eventually you come to these tunnels that go through this mountain (Mt. Waialeale) which get's the most precepetation per year.  Well I tried to do it a long time ago with my old travel partner Thomas which was crappy, we hiked barefoot and just messed up our feet, anbd didn't finish the hike cause it was too late.  Well this time, we got to the tunnels which were crazy (I'll add pics shortly).  I honestly felt like Indiana Jones.  I mean, we found these tunnels and they go through the mountain, well, it was innaresting to say the least.  We rented this piece of crap car, which me and Andy called "Mama" short for Mother Goose, which came from Gray Goose.  But it got us around everywhere.

      You know, some of you may know, and others may not, but when I came out to Hawaii I started writing a book, essentially it became an extension of my journal that I keep, but also incorporated some ideas and tried to explain why I came out here.  The title of the book, tentatively: "Why I didn't buy the 5000 dollar leather couch".  I never understood it completely, but an old friend of mine from Shell bought a $5k leather couch - and then didn't understand why she could never travel or do other things.  I once said that I thought I could be happy with a small shack in Hawaii close to the beach that just had some beach chairs and a cooler that doubles as a coffee table.  Well that's exactly what I have, a few other things, but not much, and I gotta tell you, I can't complain too much.  So a 5000 dollar leather couch?  Probably not in my life time, I'll take a beach over that any day of the week.

      Howdy!  Did a few hikes this weekend and went to the beach a few times.  Nothing too wild, but still had a good time.  Saw plenty of fireworks from my lani, and had a few good things to eat too.  Looking forward to going to Kauai in a couple of weeks, seeing some of my family.  My parents are off in Ireland right now, and next weekend I am gonna try and scope out some places for them to stay at Christmas time.  Here's a picture of some of the fireworks.

      This past Sunday, I picked up Andy from work and while we were driving around I decided to show him this place in Tauntalus which is the mountains behind me in Honolulu.  It's a place I went to with my parents while they were out here last xmas.  It's on the top of this hill in a national park, and just a really cool place.  I always thought it would be a good place to take a date, and actually while we were up there, there was a couple getting married there.  But you do this real cool windy drive up to the top of the mountains, and at the top there is this great look out point.  It's one of those many things that makes me think that I am very fortunate to be in Hawaii.  On a side note, it's great having my old guitar out here, it sounds much better than the one that I was renting, and I really think that I am the best I have ever been at guitar, though not good by a long shot.  Still, it's fun to play and look at the ocean.  And for some reason I am much better in the morning than in the evening.  Weird.

      Ok, we need to talk.  5 times in about the past two months I've had a serious problem with leaving things on the roof of my car.  Shortly before I moved into my current apartment I was homeless and staying with my co-worker Dean.  I thought I would be nice and bring some beer, so I picked up 20 bottles of Budweiser.  Well after I picked it up, I put it on the roof of my car as I was getting in, and left in there.  Fortunately some lady yelled at me and I was able to save them.  While Heather was here, I left my wallet on the roof - long story short, I got all the stuff back.  Then on Kauai - just a bottle of water, but water none the less.  Then while I was back in Texas, my only pair of flip flops I brought with me.  And then back on HI again, another bottle of water.  Seriously!!!  I need to do something about this.  I need to get leaving things on the roof of my car.  What if I have kids one day!!!  I worked till 1am, I got up at 11:00am, it's now 11:30am, and I'm having a beer - natty light.  It's gonna be a good day.  Beach later, maybe a Mai Thai at Dukes.  Who's comin next?

      Two things about beer.  Me and Andy picked up a 12 pack of heiniken and I gotta say, it was the most impressive enigneering design of a 12 pack of beer that I have ever seen.  Slits were put into certain spots to let the cap stretch a little bit and it didn't rip the box or anything, impressive.   Secondly, me and Andy have been drinking a fair amount of Natural Light (Natty), and we decided that we are going to stack it against the wall, so we have a wall of Natty going on... like I said... impressive.

      Got up around 4:30am and got read to go back home... to Hawaii.  It was an odd feeling.  And from the moment I hugged Heather goodbye, it was like my surroundings dissapeared and I was just a traveler again, walking through an airport, getting on a plane, then another airport, then another plane, and I blinked once and saw Heather, and blinked again and Andy was picking me up.  Back in Hawaii... Aloha.

      Floated down the river with the Hawaii girls.  It was a lot of fun.  The river wasn't crowded at all and we all had a blast, had a good number of beers.  Went to eat at some place afterwards that I don't remember so well, and played a little frisbee afterwards - raindrops!  Went back to Heather's afterwards and crashed.

      Went to James Coney Isalnd for lunch - it's the bomb.com.  Went to San Antonio with Heather after that.  Had Taco Cabana for dinner which was kind of dissapointing, and partied with the other Hawaii girls Jamie and Joie.  It was a lot of fun... I had a good night, sort of.
