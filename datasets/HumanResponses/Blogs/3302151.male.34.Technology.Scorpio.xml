      I just noticed the Ads by Google banner at the top of the page which had picked up on Rich and Lisa's friendly discussion on the merits of woodwind instruments.  Google is helpfully advertising clarinets, french horns, instrument cases, etc.  Now, after my initial post which included the term "leather whips" I'm a bit fearful of Google's ingenuity.

      Phew!  After working with a team of top rocket scientists I finally figured out how to join Four Lads...and there was much rejoicing.  I have been reading the posts from afar as I was unable to officially join and have enjoyed the banter.  Hopefully, I'll be able to make this as much a part of my day as breakfast cereal and leather whips.  Cheers.

      I'll be out of touch for about a week while I go visit people in the vicinity of the Mouse and company. This really is vacation for me since there are no relatives involved and there is nothing remotely business related to interfere with my time off. Although it seems when I take trips like these the most unexpected things seem to occur. The last such jaunt, about a year ago, ended with an interesting trip to a nudist colony (For your own safety do not create a mental image). Quite a new experience for me. Ask me about it some time if you need to laugh.

       OK, here’s an interesting chain of emails between Lisa and I.  A bit of background:    •	Rick’s fourth-grade recorder concert is tomorrow night, and Rick was trying to cram all of his practicing into the day before.  As Lisa and I discussed this, I remembered that the sign-up form for fifth-grade band is due this week. •	I started playing the violin in 4th grade.  I starting playing trumpet in 6th grade and switched to French horn in band in 8th grade. •	Lisa was not in band. •	My fourth-grade son, Rick, has the uncanny ability to irritate my wife to heights not measurable by science.  I am pretty sure he got that from me. •	Because of the late time I usually get home from work, Lisa does most of the helping with homework.  OK, off we go…   From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:03 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  BTW, have you seen the sign-up for band next year (just a half-sheet)?  I had it next to my chair this weekend.  I have not talked to you (or him) about it, but I think we should think about it depending on how much he enjoyed the recorder.  Just think how much more annoying he’d be with a clarinet…  Rich    From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:07 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night   I found the band slip today and it is set out to look at tonight.  Lisa   From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:08 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  OK.  By the way, I was joking about the clarinet.  No woodwinds.  Ever.  Rich    Here is where it begins to get fun.      From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:14 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night  Just who made you the boss of music and when did woodwinds get such a bad rap?  I actually think that the violin would be worse that a woodwind at the beginning any day. Any instrument   is going to be extremely painful at the beginning and why would you worry   about it when most of the practicing would happen on my watch?  Lisa    OK, at this point I am not sure if she is joking or not.  Had we been talking on the phone or in person, I would have been able to tell.  Rather than backing off and seeing if I had offended somehow, I decided to keep going and see what happens.   Two additional points of background: I have an agreement with Lisa that I will set a good example for our kids and eat everything except for squash and zucchini.  I hate them and will never eat them.  Ever again.   I am also can be quite a snob when it comes to music.  There are specific things that I dislike and certain things that I am unreasonably stubborn about.  For example, the only way to listen to Handel’s Hallelujah Chorus is with orchestra and chorus.  No rock or pop remixes for me, thanks.  Anyways, back to the obnoxiousness…    From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:019 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  I made myself the boss of music.  Right after I banned zucchini and squash from my plate.  I keep my music snobbery hidden most of the time.  Woodwinds bring it out of me.  Don’t ask me to explain why.  I get from my dad he - had the same rule.    Yes, violins sound about as bad at first.  Ask Keith.  I worry about because… I am the boss of music.  Rich    OK, I was just goofing around.  I really do not consider myself the boss of music, but it was too good to pass up. My dad really did have that rule.  We could play any instrument we wanted but not the clarinet.  No squeaks.  I do have fond memories of my Keith, my brother, running upstairs and screaming in pain while I practiced my violin in fourth grade.      From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:26 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night  Well, just so you make your feelings clear.  I was a little unsure about how you felt before so I thought I'd poke around in it a little to find out how you really felt.  I am just so glad that you have named yourself the boss.  It's good to recognize delusional behavior when you hear it.    Also, violins are definitely worse.  Lisa    Off to the races.     From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:19 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  You are only jealous because you are not The Boss of Music (please note the capital letters).  Early violin players are not worse than early woodwind players.    While they are not much better (which I did admit in my previous note), it is that subtle distinction that makes violins acceptable and woodwinds not.  Rich   Not wanting to appear like a pompus buffoon, I made sure that I pointed out that I did admit that beginning violin players sound awful.  But Lisa came back with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch:    From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May  17, 2004 3:39 PM Subject: RE:   Tuesday night  Then I will make it my mission in life to encourage all three of our children to choose a woodwind instrument.    Rick will play the clarinet, Tori the sax and Drew the bassoon.  They will perform concerts for you each evening when you come home and you will have to smile and clap after each song.  Lisa    Ouch, that would just be painful.  Lacking any good comeback I counted to five (three, sir), I decided to distract her with chocolate.   From: Rich Sent: Monday, May   17, 2004 3:53 PM Subject: RE:  Tuesday night  Right.  In order to do that, you would have to get them to all agree to play the instrument YOU wanted them to play.  Maybe you could talk one or maybe two into it, but not all three.  Unless you told Drew that the bassoon was also a rocket launcher.  Did I mention that we have a  whole cooler of ice cream treats free for employee consumption?  The Turtle ice cream bar is pretty good.  Yummmm…   The fact that I get free ice cream bars at work (really good ones) for a few weeks should distract her from the fact that I have run out of witty responses.  I know the free Starbucks coffee I get at work was particuarlly irritating.     From: Lisa  Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 4:04 PM Subject: RE: Tuesday night  You have no idea the power of a mother.   They wouldn't even know what hit them and they will think that it's their own idea.   Maybe I'll even let them know that this is all a scheme to torture their father and they will share in my joy.  Go ahead and eat all of the ice cream you'd like but remember that we don't have any money to buy bigger pants.  Lisa    I think my wife’s friends at this point are next to here making whooping noises, high-fiving each other and going “you go, girl!”.  Feeling worked over like the last pair of black sandles at a Payless show store during a “Buy 1 get 2 Free” sale, I decide to retreat, eat a strawberry ice-cream sandwich, and see if I can salvage this little exchange (I am not optimistic).  Work then intruded for a while.  Having forgotten that Rick’s recorder concert tomorrow and his frantic last-minute practicing is what began this whole discussion, I was blown away by Lisa’s next email:    From: Lisa Sent: Monday, May 17, 2004 4:25 PM Subject: Tuesday Night  I have now decided that there is nothing as bad as recorder practice.  Lisa    Nothing ends a good conversation (in person or via email) like the sound of a fourth-grader playing the Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go One” from Titanic.  ‘Nuff said.

       urlLink Microsoft's legal bill 'too big' ...that's only fair.  We (the consumer) have been paying for Microsoft's business practices for years now via indirect methods (bankrupting competitor's superior products via monopolistic methods, shoddy software rife with security holes, rant rant rant).  So we should now have to pay financially as well.  Feh.

      I suppose I should post something so Rich doesn't feel quite so lonely out in the blogsphere. I also want to extend a heartfelt atta-boy to Rich for diligently pursuing good communications technology.   FYI - I still have ownership of theStand.org domain through January of 2005. If anyone has a good idea for it I'd be willing to lend it out. Just let me know if you're interested.

      Element Name: WOMANIUM  &nbsp; Symbol: WO  &nbsp; Atomic Weight: (Don't even go there)  &nbsp; Physical Properties: Generally soft and round in form. Boils at nothing and may freeze at any time. Melts when treated properly. Very Bitter if not used well.  &nbsp; Chemical Properties: Very active. Highly unstable. Possesses strong affinity for gold, silver, platinum and precious stones. Violent when left alone. Able to absorb great amounts of exotic food. Turns slightly green when placed next to a better specimen.  &nbsp; Usage: Highly ornamental. An extremely good catalyst for dispersion of wealth. Probably the most powerful income reducing agent known. Caution: Highly explosive in inexperienced hands.  &nbsp; ***************  &nbsp; Element Name: MANIUM  &nbsp; Symbol: XY  &nbsp; Atomic Weight: (180 +/- 50)  &nbsp; Physical Properties: Solid at room temperature, but gets bent out of shape easily. Fairly dense and sometimes flaky. Difficult to find a pure sample. Due to rust, aging samples are unable to create electricity.  &nbsp; Chemical Properties: Attempts to bond with any WO any chance it can get. Also tends to form strong bonds with itself. Becomes explosive when mixed with KD (Element: CHILDIUM) for prolonged periods of time. Neutralize by saturating with alcohol.  &nbsp; Usage: None known. Possibly good methane source. Good samples are able to produce large quantities on command. Caution: In the absence of WO, this element rapidly decomposes and begins to smell.
