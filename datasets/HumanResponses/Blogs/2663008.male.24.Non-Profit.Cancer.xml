      So I'm walking to work today and a man says, "Boy! It's cold today."  Disgusted I glance at him, because I have heard that same statement 500 hundred times within the last 2 blocks.  "That, my friend, is the understatement of the decade." I retort.  To put just how cold it is up here in visual form here is an example.  Tonight at work, one of my co-workers arrived bound head to toe in frost bite prevention accessories. Peering out between a frozen scarf and the hood of a red jacket I see two frozen white eyebrows and sweat droplets crystallized, hanging from his eyelashes.  The scarf was frozen in a circular pattern where Pablo had panted from walking 15 blocks. Ouch.

      This is starting the second week of my break from school.  It has been a good experience so far.  Although it has been extremely lonely here, I'm grateful for the chance to learn to be alone.  Learn to be along? Yes, I have spent the majority of my life dependent on everyone else.  I changed my likes and dislikes with each new friend.  My attitude would go from good to worse with each person that I felt was what I wanted to be like.  I looked for acceptance from the people.  So recently I have felt super depressed because everyone that I hold close to me here in the city is away on break.  It really started when my friend Zach got married, and his roommate Andrew got married.  They both moved away.  Then my roommate of 2 years moved away.  It didn't seem that God was refilling my friendship quota.  It has been really tough, not having fellowship or people to call to share my troubles with.  I feel that God is trying to teach me that my life, my emotions, my ability to stand is not in people but in him.  I've really been trying to pray more.  In Bill Hybels book To Busy Not To Pray, he gives an anachronism to follow when praying.  ACTS, Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, and Supplication.  So I've tried to keep this in my mind when I pray, and when I write my prayers.  God is good.

      This is a dream that I had on  11/18/03.  I just thought I would post this so that everyone would have a chance to hear it.  11/18/03   Dream Log:         I woke in a bedroom talking to a young girl.  We were talking about God, and salvation.  But our conversation was not the reason for me being there.  It was a birthday party.  But for whom?  It was my brother’s birthday.  But wait, I don’t have a brother.  Do I?         We move to the outer room to great the guest of honor.  The door opens and Jesus walks in.  In my heart I knew Christ was my big brother.  He smiled at me with a look of familiarity.  He knows me, deeply.  All of the dignitaries, and important people approach him to talk but he keeps his on me.  He doesn’t seem too interested in what they have to say.  Sort of like when your at a family reunion and your great aunts keep asking you questions and you just shake your head and smile.  Yet Christ stays focused on me.         When he finishes talking he come straight to me and extends his hand to me.  He leads me with intent out side.  I hold his hand and lay my head on his shoulder.  He holds me tight.  I know what he is about to do, and I tell him, “I’m scared.” “Why?” he gently replies. “Because of the things that I have done,” I confess. “Then pray about it.” So we stop walking and I close my eyes and begin to pray.  I run through a list of my sins.  Detail after detail I run through the catalog that I carry around in my heart.   “You’ve already said that,” he replies. “Don’t be afraid,” He says as he lets go of my hand.  Walking backward toward a door. Yet the whole time he has his eye on me.   	This is why we had gathered.  He reaches toward the doorknob.  Slowly turning it He turns his head to look at me and smile.    The End

      Semester's over, finally.  So I'm out of school for 3 weeks.  I'm hoping that this break will be a time for me to regroup after the battle.  I need some alone time with God to recenter myself and focus on whats important in life.  Today Pastor Bill talked about spiritual growth.  How we as Christians need to be pruned so that we will bear more fruit.  So I hope to oil the shears and do some gardening this next 3 weeks.

      My graduation is growing closer and closer.  It's exciting and nerve racking at the sametime.  We, as college students, have just spent 16 years, more for some, of our lives in school.  Now we are catapulted into the "real world", whatever that means.  Life, parents, creditors, and self expects us to know what the heck we were meant to be.  I spent the first 3 years of college thinking I knew what I wanted to be.  Now I'm ready to graduate and it feels like I'm starting over from ground zero.  I guess I'll just make a career out of college.  Just joking mom and dad, and visa.  I'll pay you back sometime.

      Today marked that last day of my American Sign Language 1 class.  But I feel that it was more than that.  I feel that God is finally showing me where I fit into the big picture.  It is amazing to look back and see the events in my life that have led me to where I am now.  Some events better than others but necessary to lead me to where I am today.  I have prayed for a long time that God would just show me what he wanted to do, but it seemed that I was never hearing anything back.  I feel that ASL Interpreting is something that has always been in me.  My mother was telling me of the sign language book that I had when I was a kid.  I remember always being interested in sign language, and for some reason I pick it up really quick.  I love to talk to people, being with people, and helping others.  A culmination of all these put together seems to be interpreting.  Interesting that I spent more than 3 years studying photography.  How will God use it?  We'll see.

      It's a cold day here in Rodgers Park.  Warmer than the last few days but, cold none the less.  I just started this Blog.  Why?  Who knows.  Like anyone cares to hear the rambelings of a prematurly balding 23 year old, who is over weight and hangs out with homeless people.  Well don't look if you don't like it.  I'm not forcing you.  I thought I would share the events of my average life. Maybe you and I will learn something from each other.

      Today when I was getting off the train I noticed a sign above the stairs going down.  The sign read, "Watch where you step".  At first I thought, "Well, gee, thanks there mister sign.  I'm walking down a long set of steps going down where am I gonna look, up?"  But as I made my way down the side walk I thought about it a little longer.  "Watch where you step.  How profound."  I'm walking down a sidewalk full of cracks, pot holes, and unevenness.  In the same since we are all walking down a sidewalk of life.  This sidewalk is full of potholes of lonliness, cracks caused by unforgivness, and unevenness of modern culture.  If we're not careful we could trip and fall, sprain an ankle maybe even worse.  Some people have stepped into some of these potholes, gotten a foot stuck.  They've been struggling to get their foot free.  They struggle night and day with all their strength but just can't seem to get free.  If only someone would come along side them and give them a gentle tug, some of them might even need a good push.  So please as you're walking down the sidewalk "Watch where you step".  If along the way you should see someone stuck give them some help, you never know when you might need someone to do the same for you.

         The Vision      So this guy comes up to me and says "What's the vision? What's the big idea ?"  I open my mouth and words come out like this:   The vision?  The vision is JESUS - obsessively, dangerously, undeniably Jesus.  The vision is an army of young people. You see bones? I see an army.  And they are free from materialism.  They laugh at 9-5 little prisons.  They could eat caviar on Monday and crusts on Tuesday.  They wouldn't even notice.  They know the meaning of the Matrix, the way the West was won. They are mobile like the wind, they belong to the nations. They need no passport.  People write their addresses in pencil and wonder at their strange existence.  They are free yet they are slaves of the hurting and dirty and dying.   What is the vision ?   The vision is holiness that hurts the eyes. It makes children laugh and adults angry.  It gave up the game of minimum integrity long ago to reach for the stars.  It scorns the good and strains for the best. It is dangerously pure.   Light flickers from every secret motive, every private conversation.  It loves people away from their suicide leaps, their Satan games.  This is an army that will lay down its life for the cause.  A million times a day its soldiers  choose to loose  that they might one day win  the great 'Well done' of faithful sons and daughters.  Such heroes are as radical on Monday morning as Sunday night.  They don't need fame from names. Instead they grin quietly upwards and hear the crowds chanting again and again: "COME ON!"  And this is the sound of the underground The whisper of history in the making Foundations shaking Revolutionaries dreaming once again Mystery is scheming in whispers Conspiracy is breathing... This is the sound of the underground And the army is discipl(in)ed.  Young people who beat their bodies into submission.  Every soldier would take a bullet for his comrade at arms.  The tattoo on their back boasts "for me to live is Christ and to die is gain".  Sacrifice fuels the fire of victory in their upward eyes.  Winners.                 Martyrs.  Who can stop them ?  Can hormones hold them back?  Can failure succeed?  Can fear scare them or death kill them ?  And the generation prays  like a dying man  with groans beyond talking,                 with warrior cries, sulphuric tears and  with great barrow loads  of laughter!  Waiting. Watching: 24-7-365 Whatever it takes they will give:  Breaking the rules.                 Shaking mediocrity from its cozy little hide.  Laying down their rights and their precious little wrongs,  laughing at labels, fasting essentials.  The advertisers cannot mould them.  Hollywood cannot hold them.  Peer-pressure is powerless to shake their resolve at late night parties before the cockerel cries.  They are incredibly cool, dangerously attractive inside.  On the outside? They hardly care.  They wear clothes like costumes to communicate and celebrate but  never to hide.  Would they surrender their image or their popularity?  They would lay down their very lives - swap seats with the man on                death row - guilty as hell.  A throne for an electric chair.  With blood and sweat and many tears, with sleepless nights and fruitless                days, they pray as if it all depends on God and live as if it all depends                on them.  Their DNA chooses JESUS. (He breathes out, they breathe in.)  Their subconscious sings. They had a blood transfusion with Jesus.  Their words make demons scream in shopping centers.  Don't you hear them coming?  Herald the weirdos! Summon the losers and the freaks.  Here come the frightened and forgotten with fire in their eyes.  They walk tall and trees applaud, skyscrapers bow, mountains are dwarfed by these children of another dimension.  Their prayers summon the hounds of heaven and invoke the ancient dream of Eden.  And this vision will be. It will come to pass; it will come easily; it will come soon.  How do I know? Because this is the longing of creation itself, the groaning of the Spirit, the very dream of God.  My tomorrow is his today.  My distant hope is his 3D.  And my feeble, whispered, faithless prayer invokes a thunderous,                resounding, bone-shaking great 'Amen!' from countless angels, from                hero's of the faith, from Christ himself -  the original dreamer, the ultimate winner.  Guaranteed.   By:Pete Greig

      Book Review:  "Not Even a Hint: Guarding Your Heart Against Lust"/ Joshua Harris   I was privileged to get a free copy of Joshua Harris' new book  Not Even a Hint  to review on my blog.  Yes this is the same Joshua Harris that wrote  I Kissed Dating Goodbye  and also  Boy Meets Girl .  I know that a lot of people do not like his views on dating.  "He's just too radical," I had a friend tell me.  I wish this was the way people view me sometimes.  I this is the way that people should view all Christians.  We should be radical, counter-culture, "set apart".   Not Even a Hint  is also radical, but very biblical.    Harris admonishes us to fill our minds with scripture, not with smut out of magazines, television, catalogues from our favorite clothing stores that could be viewed as unwholesome, and other parts of our lives that we don't take the time to inspect.  Unlike some books this one does not claim to have the sure fire, overnight cure for lusting.  Instead he brings biblical truths to the surface to assist and reshape our approach of conquering lust.  It is a good read, with many resources and verses to build your mental defenses.  I have to admit that the first couple of chapters were a chore to get through.  Harris is trying to reinforce that mercy and grace are abundant.  He delivers this idea, then restates it, then recaps on what he just restated then just to make sure we don't forget he says it again.  They are important chapters to read so press on it is a great book.  It has helped me greatly.     WARNING:  After reading this book expect serious spiritual attack.  You become even more tuned to noticing the things around you and just how filled our society is with sex oriented advertising.  READ IT, PRAY ABOUT IT, THEN READ IT AGAIN.   urlLink Amazon sells it    urlLink Christianbooks.com

      Words of Wisdom: "On Living Simply", John Chrysostom 389 A.D.  All of us are liable to complain of our work.  We grumble at the hardness of our work, at its monotony and dullness, at the lack of time to rest and relax.  We moan about how weary we feel.  And we wish that we were wealthy enough to be free of work.  But just imagine what perpetual leisure actually means.  In you mind let me give you a large house in which to live, filled with comfortable furniture.  In this house you only need to nod at a servant, and you will be brought dish upon dish of the most delicious food.  Outside there is a garden filled with trees and shrubs, which bear sweet-smelling flowers.  For a few hours, for a few days perhaps, you would enjoy being in such a lace.  but soon you would feel bored and restless.  Your bones would become still for lack of exercise.  Your stomach would swell with all that food.  Your head would ache for lack of anything to stimulate the mind.  Your mansion in which work was impossible would seem like a prison.  God has designed us to labor for our bread; only in toil can our minds and bodies find contentment.

      Tonight started the Founders Week at Moody Bible Institute.  Dr. Stohl talked tonight about the book of James.  How God has promised to pour out his blessings upon us.  All He requires is the fervent prayers of the righteous. This is not a get rich quick plan, or a sure fire way to get that Benz.  This is a sure fire way to make changes in your world, in your family, in your life.  How many times have you said, "Man, this world is going down the crapper", followed by a huff, and the exclamation, "I wish I could do something about it." WELL YOU CAN.  Fall on you knees, rear back your head and cry out to heaven.  Pray for your children, your parents, your church leaders, the President, the Congress, the poor, the battered women and children, the people with AIDS, the high school students in your community that feel that no one understands them or cares about them.  Pray for the up coming elections.  There are problems all around you, so you shouldn't have trouble finding something to pray about.  But here is the awesome thing, God hears, God is able, and he wants to help us.  Rejoice, and be joyful for our Savior has come to save and to heal.  He hears the cry of the downtrodden and broken (you and me).  Rejoice for He and He alone can turn the tide in this decadent world heading toward destruction.  Do not give up, hold strong in the knowledge that Christ Jesus is ABLE.

        Psalm/Lamentation  Sometimes I feel, Like I wanna go home Be with my Father, Near His royal throne.  To leave this place and it's problems behind. Wash the past  from my mind.  Send the raft, Lord,  and let them drown. They mock you Father, and put you down.  Not by their words, but by their actions. In shot glass form, In lustful passions.  One night stands, all in the name of fun. Cheapened love, and regretting none.  Banners of hatred, Raised in Your name. Sunday sermons, On fortune and fame.  In wars and plunder, they give you praise. "Unto you Lord, This savage blood we raise."  Why do you leave me here? Why must I stay? Send Elijahs' chariot, and take me home, I pray.  Yes, sometimes I feel, Like I wanna go home. Be with my Savior, my Lord, my Brother, the abandoned stone.   By James Dalton

          I was going to put a plate of food in the microwave so I could have some lunch.  I placed 2 frozen Brats, and 2 frozen Bob Evans sasuage and bisquits.  Breakfast/Lunch of champions.  I didn't want to dirty another plate so i just grabbed one destine for the sink, thus the red nose.  I didn't plan this, I promise, I'm not clever enough, nor am I cheesy enough to plan something like this just to email out.  But it made me laugh.    Brennan Manning in his book "Raggamuffin Gospel", ahhhmmm mom...., calls these moments "Strawberries".  He speaks of a man that is running from a lion, he reaches what seems to be the end of his journey at the edge of a cliff.  Suddenly he notices a rope at his feet.  Phew, he thinks.  So he begins to climb down, when at the top mice begin to chew at the rope.  Now he is caught between a lion and a long drop, when he notices a couple of wild strawberries.  He reaches out, picks it, and eats.  Yum, he thinks to himself, that was the best strawberries ever.  Manning states that if we are so consumed with the lions of our life, or the jagged rocks below, we will miss these "strawberries" of life.  They come in the form of an unexpected letter from a friend, a hug that catches you off gaurd, a babies giggle that seems to be infectious, a face in a plate of food ready to be nuked.  Many strawberries line the rocky, lion filled, rat filled roads of life.  If you are not careful you could miss the tastiest morsels of life.  The things that make life worth the living.

        Untitled Psalm: 3/18/04  In this place full of many choices, I search, for the path for which I am chosen. The doors all seem so right, yet none of them are open.  Oh, just to catch a glimpse of light, trickling under and into my view. Then I would know, Then I would move.  I search within to find a key, A note, a picture, some kind of clue. Still I wait. Ever watchful of what you would have me do.  Time seems to stand still And soon it seems, As if the doors are multiplying.  What is this cruel game, That brings me to my knees. Why do You stay quiet, &nbsp;&nbsp;instead of leading me.  The whisper within has paused, or left it seems.  When will you speak? How long must I wait here, in this purgitorial state.  The longing to do your will, knots up within me. Do You not know, I will say yes. For I know that anything less is misery.  Is it me that stands in Your way? Does my flesh prevent, All the things that you would have.  By: James Dalton

      "This is the start of something great", "God is starting something awesome here"  This was the common response Saturday as people left the sanctuary of First Evangelical Free Church on Berwyn and Ashland.  A 24 hour prayer vigil was held with the original intent of lifting the needs of a Capital Campaign to raise money for a new building.  But as the Spiritual Emphasis team began to discuss the opportunity they realized the gravity of such and event.  "We want to do something that is going to last after the fund raiser is over," Troy Hower, leader of the Spiritual Emphasis team, said. "It's about so much more than just money.  It's about reaching out to people and seeking God."  This proved to be the case.  People showed up to spend and hour in prayer and found themselves staying for two or three hours.  Time seemed to stand still as people entered the dimly lit room.  The odor of frankincense lingered in the air symbolizing the thickness of the Holy Spirit that had settled on that place.  People walked the perimeter of the room reading the praise and prayer requests that people had written on the walls.  Some added their own writings, others would simply place their hand over the writing already there and lift it up to God.  At the close of the 24 hours there was a sense that it shouldn't stop.  "We've got to do this again, and soon," many people said with tear filled eyes.  It was as if a hunger for Gods presence in peoples lives had been building up and finally they were able to feast at their Fathers table.  God met with the people of First Free this weekend, creating a hunger and a thirst for a deeper, more personal relationship with their creator and with their brothers and sisters.   The next 24 hour vigil is already in the planning.  God exceeded all expectations and will continue to do so.  Praise to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.

      The other day as I was walking out of a school building I was disturbed to see three young women scantly clad walking a manikin man down the side walk.  Any other day this would not have surprised me being that it is an art school and in Chicago; anything goes.  But their clothes matched.  As I went to sit on a window sill I was approached by the one wearing a 4 inch green plaid skirt, green boots with stiletto heals, and Catholic school girl style shirt.  "Hi! Want to try our new Axe body spray?", she said as she armed herself with a can that was holstered to her belt.  Before I could summon a word she had doused me in a scented fog. About this time I was a little upset.  For one thing I had just been sprayed with a very strong smelling body spray and was getting a headache.  More than that I was very disturbed at the way they were dressed.  I thought to myself, if it were not for the Axe body spray these women easily could pass as a regular prostitute not just a corporate one.  Is this what has become of our society, my generation?  We are willing to sell out our integrity, our body, our souls to Axe body spray.  I mean all corporate America, not just Axe.  Recently I have been extremely tormented by how far we as Christians have gone to fit-in with society.  We like to say on Sunday morning, "We are in the world, not of it".  But really, is there a huge difference between us and the world.  We smile at our brothers and sisters on Sunday morning, then tear them down on Monday.  We sacrifice family and friends all in pursuit of the American dream.  We are always looking for ways to spend our money on material goods that will probably break in a month.    What does it really mean to be in the world, but not of it?  To me it means looking at what the world does, observe, even write it down if necessary.  It's not hard to see the trends.  Materialism, consumerism, divorce, sex, status, etc.  Look at this things and say, "If the world is going that way, then I'm gonna go this way," and head toward the cross.  We are called to be counter-current, as Brennan Manning says in The Signature of Jesus.  The world will view us as fools for not working 30 hrs of over time a week then taking our laptop on family outings to squeeze in a few more hours of work so we can get the new Benz.  The world will view us as fools for saying, "Ya know what?  I'm not gonna wear a dress that should be worn by Barbie, just to sell Axe body spray".  The world will view us as fools for going to thrift stores so that we can save a little money.  GOOD!  I'd rather be a fool for Christ than another cog in the machine, another pawn on the battle field of self destruction.  Reprioritise, and be a fool for Christ too.

      Today has been a mountain-top experience.  God saw the need of His children and provided just has He promised and so so much more.  To explain personally how He has provided I'll share of my personal experience.  On April 1st my current roommate told me that he wanted to move out and by May 1st.  I was a little set back because this left me with little time to look for a new roommate, and in the case that I was unable to find a candidate I would have to move out.  I prayed and two people came to mind.  One of which was a guy in my small group at church.  Long story short, today he decided to move in.    On a larger level my church, First Evangelical Free Church, is in the middle of a building campaign.  Today they presented the amount raised from the leaders of the church alone. The total came out to around $700,000.  God heard the prayers of his children and answered with great abundance.  These two instances alone show the faithfulness of my Father.  We can not claim to have contrived or conjured up these results on our own.  Only the Father can provide like this.    But I trust in your unfailing love; my heart rejoices in your salvation. I will sing to the LORD, for he has been good to me.    Psalms 13:5-6

      Today as the plane descended I was in awe of the clouds around me.  I remember the first time I flew, about 9 years ago.  The most beautiful sight, to me, was and is seeing the clouds from above.  As the man made bird approached that land I thought to myself, "One day I won't need this beast of steel.  One day I'll raise to see these heights unencumbered by boarding passes, ticket lines, and attendants demanding that 'I return my seat and my tray-table to it's upright position'.  One day I'll lay on these Godly cottonballs, and finally be able to rest."  I realised today how good creation is.  When you look at the sky with it's brilliant blue, or the shimmering blades of grass that lay beneath your feet, see God.  For God created it, he liked it, and said it was good.  Soon you will be helpless but to fall to your knees, at the sheer wonder of it all.  How small, insignificant, and helpless we are in the presence of God, the Father, Abba, Daddy.
