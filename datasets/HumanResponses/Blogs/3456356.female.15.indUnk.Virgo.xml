      :) went to Changi Naval Base for the Navy Open House with my parents today. At first we thought that unauthoritised vehicles wont be allowed in the vicinity of the area. That's why there is a shuttle bus service at the Singapore Expo. So we drove to Expo and went there to take the bus. Then we saw this unexpected and large crowd queuing for the bus!! My gosh, it was really really packed with lots of people and the queue extended from inside Expo all the way out to the MRT Station. So my parents and I decided to have a change of plans. Since it was getting late and the Open House ends pretty soon, like 6 or 7pm when it was already 5pm, why don't we come again the next day. All of us were very hungry, so we decided to get ourselves some food at the Food Fair going on in one of the halls. But we couldn't find the hall and decided to dine at Burger King. Then we saw the poster of the Navy Open House. It was till 9pm. So we went to look at the queue and realised that the organisers were pretty efficient in getting the people up the shuttle buses and the buses came continuously. So, we returned to Plan A: Go to the Navy Open House. Well, time passed really fast. Half an hour and we already got a shuttle bus. Sounds a lot but judging from the amount of people there, its rather good already. Well, the place was pretty good. But it was a pity we got there too late. When we took enough pictures of the boats and submarines and looking at the exhibitions, the rides and games and stalls were all closing already. The poster wrote that it was till 9pm but effectively, 7pm to 9pm there was nothing going on except some disco stuffs. So, technically speaking, it ends at 7pm.. Oh well, not that I didn't enjoy myself. It was rather fun. I like taking pictures and took quite a lot of them today :) The return trip wasn't as simple. Everyone was going home at the same time so there's this big mass of people walking to the shuttle bus stop. Then because it was already dark, no one could tell that we have already reached the queue. Then apparently the crowd didn't walk in a straight line and everything was in a mess. The authorities took a pretty long time to figure out that the way to stop the mess was to break a part of the crowd and then regulate the human traffic moving into the queue.  Stuck in that mess for 40 mins. Hot, stuffy, squeezy.. It was practically a feast for mosquitoes. But oh well, we made it out alive :) Just got home. It's pretty fun, despite the queue on the way back haha :)

      Well, not feeling very good today and so I decided to not go to school. Woke up pretty late today at around 11am.. Haish, realised that 2I is going to take a class photo for Luke. He's leaving for America soon. Kinda sad, though I don't really know him well despite being classmates for 2 years. Wish that he would be able to come back for class chalet at the year end if there is one.. hah.

      I'm finally getting the momentum of homework. and as usual it seems a little late for that but it still pays off a little though. hmm, sewed on my Total Defence Badge on my uniform today. Pricked my fingers many times.. It's so painful. Not that I'm good at sewing, I know I'm terrible at it but if not for NP I wouldn't have done it either Spent a whole lot of time doing that and come to think of it I may not even get to wear it again. Oh well, I hope I get to return to the unit, If circumstances permit. =) *cross fingers*  Homework's piling up again. Slept at about 4am last night I hope I can finish the homework to be handed in tomorrow.. god bless myself and all out there under the same fate.

      Well, I just returned home a few hours ago from the CLDDS Drama. There were three short stories all revolving around money as the theme. There was really very little non-CLDDS people around I would say. The atmosphere was lacking at the start of the whole performance.  Met Woei Xi and Joycelin at the theatre and the 4B girls sat together in one row.=) The play wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. Guess I was a little prejudiced about Chinese stuffs. Thinking that it would be cliche and extremely boring. There were some parts that were really funny and the actors did their best. Hah, I was given speical instructions to pay attention to the play at the beginnign of the play. Cos its a flash done by darling Lu Shan. Hmm, but it ended up more like a slideshow cos the tablet PC was rather lag. Then Lu Shan was complaining that to Meishan, Constnce, Joycelin, Woei Xi and I as we went home. Hah, RV indeed is poor. Our most advanced computer, the Tablet PC is laggy. As repeated by Lu Shan many times.. haha After the play we went home while Joycelin and Woei Xi went to eat. What a boring day.

      Hmm, Talentime was yesterday. Had a rather fun time at RV though there were some major hicups throughout the event. But, well.. the night was meant for all to enjoy so why take anything to heart after all that jeering. The boos were just a normal reaction for a sudden technical fault when everyone is enjoying. We all know that the SCs and crew did their best. =) So, first were the soloists.. Well, they all were not bad but their full potential wasn't really showed due to the mike. Think it could have changed the whole result of the competition.  Group singing was not bad. Friends up on stage. Rachel, Magdalene, Wan Hsin, Wen Qiang.. All of them did well. Especially Wen Qiang's group. Their harmo was excellent. The best outta all the groups I would say. However, obviously some RVians just don't know how to aprreciate it. Those others that sat around me were saying that the song was boring and they were turning into stone. Just because they dont know that song and that song was rather a slow one.. They were not interested. Oh well, they're missing out on a lot. After the whole event, wanted to go find Rachel. But then I didnt really know whether or not to. I dont know why, something was holding me back..  Then Meishan and Priscilla said they were going home with WanZhen they all. So off they went. Then constance was going back with Rachel Liao and Samantha. But they weren't leaving yet, and so I joined them at the canteen. Contemplating whether to find Rachel. Then she called and asked me where I was. So I went over. =) Dad sent Boon Han and Rachel home before we headed home. Was a rather fun night. all did well.=)  My first and last ever Talentime..hahax.

      hah, really really cmi manx. guess what, i scored much worser than my marksman badge test lorhx.. just for the simple fact that i was too nervous oh man.. i look at the no. of holes i have for figure 2 i already knew that there is no hope at winning already.  i got a better score for my NRA.. the bulls' eye target board. but it aint any much better either.. lol. at least i went to the shooting com lorhx. hahax.  reported there at 1000h and it was only our turn at 1300h. The organising comittee is so inefficient and obviously this is not the first time the .22 Revolver Competition is held and definitely not the first time that details wait up to 3h for their 90 seconds shoot in the range. I think the organising comittee ought to review their way of operation. oh well, if only they would.

      Heritage Day today was damn fun..lol I think i enjoyed this year's Heritage&nbsp; Day the most though the school came up with the sucky idea of having to bid for the stalls and causing us to inccur such heavy losses. But still, the money paid was worth the fun la and we didnt lose as much as expected. earned a total of a mere $100 bucks.. But our cost price was only $60..w/o adding the $194 for the stall bidding..  well, pris.meishan.stance.I...we went around eating and eating and eating man..haha, ate   Malt Candy  fishball from 4L  seaweed chicken from 4D  Ice from 4I  Jelly from 4A  Milkshake from 4C  Cupcorn of 4L  Kueh Tu Tu  Choc olate coated biscuits  Muah Chee from 4M  Tea Leaf Eggs from 4M  Kachang Puteh from 4J   and played fishing. Its very fun. The four of us fished out all the guppies in the basin in less than 5 minutes. lOl. Then we had too many fishes so gave a lot away..to meishan's junior.. yanling. .gillian..joanna..the Indian auntie at the school gate..=) the day was great with all that eating and playing and screaming about.. plus giving away fishes..haha, we were so excited when we caught all those fishes that we went around showing off..haha..   BUT.. of course we did help at the stall.. I brought in the first two customers.. and a few others subsequently.. haha, I think I can be a great salesman le..lol. Only one person refused my invitation&nbsp;to play man.. haha, but nevermind..its OK..=) Ms Tan Hui Zhen, Mr Phee, Mr Bryden Chew and Mr Chow came to play at our stall. Mr Phee the best la.. More than five in.. brought home that Mr Chow's favourite Elmo for his recently born daughter..haha, he's rather fatherly actuallly. Lol. First time he treated us to food.. Memorable lehz..  Then after the Heritage day went back to class. got loads of prizes (food) left cos we had too muCh. Then started eating.. Hah, ate a lot of Jelly.. M&amp;Ms.. crackers..  lol. So fun. So nice. So full.=)

      Well, June Holidays was fun filled and the most enjoyable of all the june holidays in my life despite this being the crucial year of my O levels. I really really think that i should relax and take things easy yea? Testing it on my Common tests la, haha.. actually i just cant be bothered to study. Hmm,school is here again but my everyday is planned rather well, fixed timing to do this.. less idling around The alarm clock dad bought me follows me everytime i take a break so i wont exceed the time i set for myself. =) Hope this can keep me going. I'm starting to have hopes on a math again. Doing this for myself. Not for the teacher. I realised how silly i was eh. But I'm careful not to spend all the time I have on mathematics.. Getting a balance between play and studies.. and mathematics and subjects and homework and revision.. just to perfect the daily schedule and to maintain it.. rather happy about things now =)

      Well, been absent for two school days.. Loads of catching up to do. Physics.. Ms So seems to have to revise all topics with the class on request by us. So I guess time spent on each chapter wont be a lot and I'll have to do my own revision before she does it with the class so that I can ask questions... A math, I'm lagging behind. Gotta catch up. Everyone's at chapter 6 while I cant figure out chapter 5 yet. Oh well, gotta see how it goes tomorrow.. So I guess I cant do much of revision today yet. Just have to do math and read through Germany. Slept too much this afternoon. Gotta make up of the lost time adious

Hah sounds silly but aye, beats being at the table doing homework right?
