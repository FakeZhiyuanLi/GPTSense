       Sad! My friends told mi tat I had help a guy who was out to take advantage of gals, the guy is a classmate and a friend of mine althought I wasn't close to the gal but he wanted mi to put in good words for him as my friends had told the gal negitive comments about him. I helped him cos I felt that he was true to mi and was a worthy  friend  to help but that was only a point of view of mi of a guy so i'm not sure about others (mostly the gals), I also donnoe about his past about his relationships wif other galfriends so I did't made much comments about him on tat. Anyway i don't reaili care about others past as whats past has past and what's important is now and the future so i placed my trust on him .  From what I had heard I think tat the gal is not mutual enough to start a relationship...

       Ya,we won a friendly match today it was against bedok police basketball team. It was a great match, whenever we score they will also return it. And the score was always so close not more than 6 i think, both team are having a hard time trying to score but because they were taller and bigger in size so we reaili had a hard time fighting for the rebound. Sad because of today's match i was injury again got elbow by 1 of them but he did't do it purposely so i did't mind it. Anyway i like this kind of match most, it was so fun to have evenly match opponent. (",)

       There is a group of boys i had always en vious  some of them is in my class. Their releationship had been so close, u can always see them hanging out together during recess, after school anytime. Even if they quarrel they will patch back in a few days and their friendship will still be the same as before or even better. They had the kind of friendship that i always dream of but their friendship is being tested again and i think it is reaili bad this time. I hope here that they will get though this too as it wasn't easy to find friends that thinks alike.
