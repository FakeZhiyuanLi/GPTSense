       Aloha! Bienvenido! Quack quack quack  So, it looks like I'll be living my life, and you'll be reading all of the intimate details of it. Yay! So, to start off, let's get some fact straight:  I am: a fan of damn good music (what meets this pre-req? We'll talk about that, young padawan) a gamer, though not the stinky kind a gamer of the pen, paper, dice, and hacking variety a reader of all sorts of books. I guess that makes me... bookish a hoopy frood a geek  I am not: a nerd a jock a goth an amalgamation of any of those three a reader of fine romantic novels a gamer of the X-Box variety *hiss* some other things. There's a lot, and most are boring.  At the moment, school is threatening to crush the life out of me. Thankfully, it's coming to a close, nearly. The end of the third quarter is coming up, and so is Spring Break! Woo woo! Spring Break! Party hardy! Not really. I'll prolly just curl up, rest, play Achaea and some PS2, and sling some dice.  More later.  -Dice Squirrel The Finest Squirrel EVER  EDIT: Err...I'm screwing around with the html for this place, so don't pay any mind to your computer exploding. That's normal. It's hip.

       On iTunes: FF7 Soundtrack On PS2: Dark Cloud 2 Mood: Mellow  Heyo World  Hope ya like the header, I'll be doin that from now on...hopefully, it'll give you an insight into..well, stuff. People like stuff, right?  Anyhoo, I just played some b-ball (the real kind) over at the middle school near mah house. It was me, my pop (I don't really call him that. It's just too quaint to resist), my best friend Alexander, and his pop. Another team (of sorts) was playing on another court, and after about 3 games, they asked us to play. They were from...oh, 20 to their late thirties, four guys. So, we just kept our teams the way we were and picked up the thrown down metaphorical gauntlet. The game (slaughter) that ensued made me realize the difference between playing every few months and every week. Maybe I'll try to do that more...I enjoy it when people aren't screaming, "YER DEAD MILLER!" (They weren't at the time. They may have after I left, though I doubt it.)  Tonight I'm off to play some Deeyundee over at Brian's place. Clark'll be running the game, and since he usually DMs a Hack-Worthy game, this should be fun. Hopefully Aerios can show off his superb Preaching and Being Holier Than Thou skills. He's got 30 fuckin ranks in each, baby.  -Dice Squirrel 30 Fuckin Ranks in Squirreling (Dice)

       As promised, the more-ness:  My spunky sidekick Amanda will be joining us. She has not yet learned the secrets of squirreling dice, but she shall learn. She's a fellow Achaea-stricken one, so on and so forth.  I think I'm greatly tired.  I think I may go to sleep.  I think this is a very good idea...  More coherency later.

        These Queen licks are flaming  On iTunes: Queen- Killer Queen On PS2: Vice City Mood: Rockin'  *wails on an air guitar* I'm rapidly becoming a Queen fan. This greatest hits album is riff-licious. If I could play a guitar that well, I would also rapidly become one helluva an 80s pop star. Too bad it's the..er...oughts. The mainstream music of today seems to be a whole lot of toneless heavy metal guitar static with raunchy, non too clever lyrics. Of course, there are a few who break out of the constraints of shitdom. To name a few: Flaming Lips (Not too new, I know, but at least popular at the moment) Queens of the Stone Age (They have bouts of crappy song writing, but I like some of their work) System of a Down (While the constant guitar static -is- present, there always seems to be a riff hidden in there somewhere that makes the wailing tolerable) Tenacious D (While the songs are Knock You On Your Ass funny, I've noticed that they aren't half bad instrumentally)  Feel free to point me in the right direction of musical nowness.  -Dice Squirrel Musically 80-30 Years Retarded

Stop paying me mind! Grr.  Hmm...I should probably include something for you that will actually be of interest...um...wow, I have nothing of interest going on right now.

What the HELL was I thinking?

        Lights, Camera, Hacktion!  On iTunes: Debussy- Clair de lune On PS2: MGS2 Mood: Shagged out after a prolonged squawk  It's been too long since I talked about what keeps me goin' day after day, project after project, Algebra class after Algebra class: Rollin' some dice!  Let's start with some history, shall we?  My mum played the earliest known D&D known to mankind in college; she didn't use rulebooks or anything. Gygax didn't get a frickin' penny. Once upon a time in 4th grade, I was home sick. Whilst in bed, I became quite bored, and to entertain my malleable young mind, my dear old mother taught me the game that would become my...HOBBY. Of course, it was an esoteric and arcane version of the rules, but it caught my interest immediately, and after she ran me through a dungeon or two of devious traps and foul monsters, my imagination was fraught with Power Gaming schemes...already. So, I continued playing this butchered (perhaps more elegant, perhaps not enough dice involved) version of D&D with some school chums. Then, one day at an innocent outing to my grandparents' house for some brouhaha, I was talking with a favorite cousin of mine, Danny. He was some bit older than me (Just a teensy tiny decade and a half or so), and had a semi-regular campaign. He suggested I buy the Player's Handbook. "The what-a-what Book?!" I gasped. He repeated his last suggestion. I gasped again, then bought the book the very next instant I could. I greedily devoured the entire 300 page tome of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons goodness in a single night. This was, mind you, 5th or 6th grade. I was quite the bookworm, as it seems. Heh, I still am, to a larger degree even. So, I made my first ever character...the illustrious Neutral Good Elven Ranger, Delebar Silversword. And so it began...  The next thing you know, I'm the 11 Year Old WonderRanger at all of the cons around Dallas, hacking it up with the best of'em. Young Caleb and Young Delebar progressed through the ranks of Hack-Jockeys faster than most, and it showed...Young Caleb won all the role-playing awards, quickly chalking up points in the RPGA, while Del racked up the kills, piling on the treasure. Before you know it, Caleb is in the top ten at every con and Del is pushing...-=10th level=-!  Good times.  More of the continuing saga of the Dice Squirrel later.  -Dice Squirrel From Wee Hackling to Mighty Hack-Jockey

        Drop the soap, biotch  On iTunes: Queen- You're My Best Friend On PS2: Metal Gear Solid 2 Mood: Smartass  Fuckin' A. I love that feeling when you absolutely ace a test/exam/VR training level.  I mean, when you figure out the last problem and scribble it in/bubble in the last ScanTron (Long live the spawn of Hal)/frag the last terrorist, you get this lovely, warm, bubbly feeling...(if it wasn't a VR mission, this may have been caused from a bullet of a forgotten wounded enemy's gun...damn you and your mercy...now you pay with your LIFE!) ...deep inside.

        The Continuing Story of Bungalow Caleb  On iTunes: Beatles- The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill (What a coincidence!) On PS2: Dark Cloud 2 Mood: Anxious for der Spring Breeeeaak!  As promised, we have part 2 of Caleb and Delebar: The Early Days  So, Young Caleb was hacking it up with the best of them whenever the cons came to town...but he found his hobby somehow lacking. A few cons a year and the odd RPGA meet wasn't enough steak and potatoes for this young Hackaphiliac, no no. What he needed was some good old fashioned weekly meets with a regular group.  An aside: I swear, I'm going to switch back into the 1st person tense sometime, I just slipped into this nasty "Young Master Caleb" business. My bad.  So, he set about to do some rabble rousing. With his proficiency in Diplomacy, he got several of his school buds to join a game with him (damnit, me) as the DM. Everyone gathered round the old kitchen table, got out the polyhedrons, and the hacking began. While I (YES!) was still a green DM, I'd like to think that I gave them a campaign with an excellent Hack Factor. It was my own campaign world, Arboria (They stole it from -me-, I swear), with its own pantheon of Gawds and whatnot. Fun stuff. But the players didn't seem as adamant about gaming as I did, and gradually they drifted away from their trusty dice... and so the first attempt at having a weekly game rotted on the vine. But I continued going to cons, visiting the comic book shop, reading all I could, even doing some meager online gaming. A MUD or two would slake my thirst for a while, but it could never reach the lofty heights of slinging dice.  Then, something extraordinary happened... the hallowed 3rd Edition of Dungeons and Dragons was released! O happy day! O glee! O rapture! It was pretty badass. I gobbled it up during the summer of 2000, and something even more extraordinary happened... the grand, illustrious Brian (*coughKillerDMcough*) started up an old game, converted to 3e of course. Skulls Teeth. The most vicious, tooth and claw, survival of the fittest that was ever dreamed up...in a single dungeon level of the Dwarven Citadel there are more death magics and pit falls and horrifying, mind warping beasties than Gary Gygax can shake a stick at (or a 10 foot pole). He made it into a monthly tournament, and at the time, that was my sole source of hacking. Plus, it was the best hacking...EVER.  I think I have tried nearly every power gaming strategy out in those Sword Kingdoms that was ever conceived. Then, my good pal Joe began to see the light and returned from the shadow of death...Mage Knight. He bought the rulebooks, and seeing what he liked, began to scheme...began to plan...for nearly the most devious (On a scale of one to two, with almost two somewhere in the one and three quarters range) campaign setting EVER... Oceanus, Tropical Paradise, World Under Fire, On The Verge of Archipelago Anarchy.  More later! SUSPENSE!  -Dice Squirrel Lengthiest Squirrel EVER

        SUSPENSE!  On iTunes: Los Lobos- Done Gone Blue On PS2: Dark Cloud 2 Mood: Relaaaaxed (Spring Break, baby)  Before I start on the beginning of the history of the Joe Era, I'd like to point out the hystericality (new word) of Achaea in this recent quote:  You have slain Jesus. "The soul of Jesus says, "Jesus does not pray for Salvation.""  I am so going to burn.  Right-o, on with the interesting stuff.  So, we left off with the beginning of Joe's scheming. This was sometime last summer, so there was time aplenty. Until  his campaign setting was complete enough to throw some monsters and a few brave adventurers into it, the group (Brian, Joe, myself, and for a short while, Fiona) took turns being DM, running little published modules. While the hack provided by Fantasy Flight Games, Green Ronin, and AEG was quite satisfying, it didn't have that fully integrated feel of a developed campaign setting... but in a few weeks, Joe had enough deviousness squirreled away in his lil world of Oceanus to supply us for years to come.  Since I like to hear myself type, let's have a short history of Oceanus and our adventuring within it, shall we?  In the beginning... there was Nothing. Out of the cosmic emptiness, the multiverse spawned the very first creature...Theoneous, the Universe Dragon. From him sprang the World Dragons, who searched the inky black skies of space for stars to devour. However, they grew sluggish and fat, and slowed their search, sated for the moment...in time, they lay down to rest forever. And atop their slumbering forms, tiny bits of matter built up around them, creating the worlds like a clam creates a pearl around a piece of sand. But of all the World Dragons, there was one who was mightiest in magic and strength, larger, faster than all the rest, blessed to be born with two heads, and all the power that came with that privilege. Galroc. He traveled further and deeper than all the rest, devouring sun after sun. But even he came to a halt after a long while had passed, and on him Oceanus formed, far away from any other of the newly formed "planets". While the world was still young and not a single creature save Galroc lived on it, a strange visitor came...he was, some would say, as mighty as Galroc, though you might put it this way..Galroc had the brute, unstoppable strength, whereas this stranger, Pathan was his name, had wiles, and even a bit of the Divine in him... Pathan spoke to Galroc, saying "Galroc, Greatest Son of Theoneous, I bring to you the future. This world of yours is blessed, the Young Gods look upon it with interest...but it is alone, and lonely, devoid of life. From you shall come the first race, the greatest of any: Dragons. But also, they shall be the last...and you shall witness their rise -and- death." With this, Pathan left, and Galroc cried two tears, one from each of his heads. Those tears swept across the bare earth to become the great seas that cover Oceanus from horizon to horizon...  As all worlds have their creation myths, this is Oceanus'. But that's stale history. Here's -slightly- stale history:  Through some turn of events that I wasn't around for, the Lox (Brian's character, a street-smart thief and scoundrel, weak of body, strong in mind, deft in fingers) was swept into some swirling vortex that landed him in this strange new world, Oceanus! Quite a switch from his old home of Faerun. Hell, he barely even knew -that- world, just the odd metropolis here and there. One of the first things that happened, and again I'm not too clear on the details here, was that a crystal shard from the ancient C'tan/Gaul War embedded itself into the Lox's heart during the voyage... this shard was once a part of the Gaul Avatar, a single being who nearly defeated the foul C'tan singlehandedly, though was destroyed in the process. But, he lived on in a way, preserved in these shards. They were embedded in random people (somehow doing it within the past month or so I believe). He met up with quite an odd assortment of "heroes": The illustrious Captain Silversword, Pirate Extraordinare, Wealth Redistributor, Swashbuckling Menace of the High Seas, Slicing and Dicing Consultant, General Badass; Da'te Mogetsu, Iajusto Master of Okina, Head of Clan Mogetsu, Slayer of Dragons, Way Too Badass Just Any Way You Look At It; Zoto Kotsumari, Most Pious Paladin of Kord, Hacking With Extreme Prejudice Versus Undead and Evil Nasties, Official Smiting Biotch. After hacking our way across the islands for a while, adventuring here and there, slaying the odd monster, we discovered (heh, through the "process of elimination" *snigger*) that by revealing another shard to the presence of a Shard Bearer (through killing them, of course), that shard would explode and "redistribute" itself equally to all the Shard Bearers, giving each of them amplified powers. We theorized that once all of the shards reside in a single person, then the Gaul Avatar would be "reborn" in that person. Ca-razy. Now, what about these C'tan people? Well, people isn't the pertinent term. These things are fucking DICKS. Let me explain.  These bastards and the Gaul are natural enemies, born to kill eachother. Some sort of serious psychological thing, I guess. So, the C'tan in the last War were eliminated down to...six. The Gaul were wiped out, and the shard broken. Now, the C'tan have learned of the Shards, and had this brilliant idea to save their own arses: enslave everyone everywhere! So they're xenophobes too, evidently. Wowee. Some major problems. Freud would go into conniptions. Now they're coming for Oceanus, and the advanced troops have landed...in a few months, they themselves arrive. Then, we're in the shitter.  Tomorrow: Will the Knights of Oceanus (and more importantly, Caleb) be in the shitter? Will the C'tan take their place in the shitter -instead-???  SUSPENSE!  -Dice Squirrel Will he squirrel dice? Yes, goddamnit!

       I'm back. Dnuh dnuh dnuh dnuh! ....hmm....yeah....  Anywho, I'm tiiiired of reading...Caleb! You type ENTIRELY too much! *falls over*  And I had a kick arsnage time in Tennessee, tank oo very muchies! I learned how to skate...properly that is....and I started to watch the Ring...but, of course,  me being the wuss I am, I freaked out and demaded the damn DVD be destroyed. And before all this, I got to hear the smacky smacky of my best bud nearly screwing her boyfriend while I was sposed to be spending time with her at her house..ah well. The curses of being me.  The events of today: I woke up in the early morn in Louisiana... My back did a chain poppy thing, which hurt like a biatch by the way, I cursed the Roll-Away my mom made me sleep on and I got ready for another EIGHT hours on the road...I got in the car, put on my lurvely 3 Doors Down  Away From the Sun  CD, layed back the seat, and fell asleep right until we get an hour away from the hell they call Deer Park so we could go to the place called Cracker Barrell to eat....Meatloaf ees good Then I ate candy buttons until we pulled up next to my little apartment. I went in and collapsed...ah...the joys of  clean homeliness.  And all that leads up to me reading what Caleb rambles on day...after day...after day....after...um...sorry...  Caleb! YOU LIE! Most of the music they play nowadays is evil Britney Spears poppy crap...My music is NOT bad! *slumps* Listen to der lyrics...I pwomise they have meaning...and...yeah...there are some bad instrumental peoples behind bad lyrics...but those two things go hand in hand. Go get some stuffies by 3 Doors Down, Staind,hmm....what else...avoid Manson at all costs...I like 'em...but you'd curse me to hell if I suggested him. Oh..Puddle of Mudd...Godsmack, The White Stripes, Audioslave, KoRn's older stuff, Nirvana (Listen to them or DIE), And since you are an intullectual person, I suggest Deadsy. Good band...hmmm...what else.... I'll post some more stuffies latersies. And if anyone has any other suggestions to get Caleb a musical life outside the wonderful Jazz music that he listens to, just lemmeh know...or something...I dunnah....  And yes, Caleb does have good taste in music, but he needs to add s'more genres to his list.   Umm...lesse...Manders not quite the experienced RPer Caleb ees. Manders wittle bitty technical Newbie. Her skills go from a little bit of D&D to full scale adicted to Achaea person. Ah well.  I've noticed Mr. Thunderbolt Boy likes the phrase "Knock You On Your Ass funny."  Here's my favorite! "See what you can accomplish while you're sober?" Hee hee, Yes! *headbang*  Oh, and when is my lovely site getting a link on here, Caleb? Eh?EH?? YOU knoooow you have it...it should be right at the top of yer favorites list....fix the problem..FIX it!  The Happy Tree Friends are scary. They die...a lot...poor little bunnies and squirrels...*sigh*  OH! OH! Read JtHM! er..Johnny the Homicidal Maniac! You can find the comics at your local Hot Topic store in malls everywhere! Whee! And after you read JtHM you should read Squee and the all color comics called I Feel Sick! Whee!

         Much Muchness   On iPod: Ottmar Liebert On PS2: Vice City Mood: Hacktacular  I have much to say.  Firstly, it's true. FFX-2 sucks.   Damnit.  Secondly, while I lurve me some lyrics (my love of Bob Dylan proves this), I even more greatly lurve me some good instrumentals.(My love of Leo Kottke proves this) And sadly, most new bands are in love with the Let's Just Wail On This Thing And Turn The Volume Up To Eleven, Fuckers!  Thirdly, Amanda, sometimes your bouts of unsanity scare me. (Yes, unsanity. I know.)  Fourthly (?), on with the history of the Deeyundee campaign! Rawk!  So, we left off with the realization that the C'tan were badass mama jammas, and that we only have two months til they arrive. We'll skip past the Us Kicking the Collective Asses of the C'tan Forward Invasion Troops, and straight into the part that matters...their arrival! It was another perfect tropical day, and we had just returned from a little subterranean tete-e-tet with the Shadow Dragon, Wraith. Much to our surprise, there happened to be the very object of our questing for the past two months: The Multiplanar Fortress of the C'tan. Naturally, Delebar wastes no time, activates a quick bit of magic, and streaks off into the air, heading straight towards those C'tan bastards. All of the cannons lock onto the poor pirate and begin shelling. With a bit of quick reflexes and some quick shield work, he gets through the worst of it. Very soon, he's too close to the fortress for the big guns to do much good, and in fact, he's so close that he recognizes a C'tan perched precariously on a spire of the fortress. Wasting no time, he gives a battle cry and charges bravely forth, only to be repelled by some foul psionic treachery of the C'tan bastard. Caught off-guard by this deflection of his mighty blow, the C'tan removes its blindfold...and that's that. Delebar no longer exists.

       Oi. Why does tiredness take over the recesses of the mind and tell you to do things such as "Go eat cake while hanging upside down on your roof!" or, for our future psycopaths out there, "Kill, maim, destroy, eat cake, kill, maim, destroy, pretty flowers, kill, maim..etc..." Yeah...well, since I have the sense as to NOT do either of those things...I will entertain you with small things that come from my big mind...or at least some witty person at the t-shirt/bumper sticker/funky saying place came up with.   If you choked a Smurf, what color would he turn?  I have gotten many answers to this question that hurts many, many minds along the way. Purple, red, green, rainbow, flesh coloured...you know..the usual. But what if...Smurfs really aren't blue? I mean, what if they are like the Blueman group thing and PAINT on their azul tinting? Ah, the world never ceases to wonder...   If a liar said he was a liar, would he be lying?  This question has bothered me for ages. Some people say that perhaps he had a moment of truth. I say that the guy has a personality disorder or something because if a liar said he was a liar then he would be telling the truth but in turn would be a lie which would make it the truth.....it's one of those circular things...you know.  Welp, since my eyes tire of looking at a computer screen, I will go stare cluelessly at some Algebra homework...Okay, fine, not cluelessly, seeing as I kick ass in graphing and stuff, but you know...it was a good thing to say at the time.  Maybe my flying monkeys will come visit me tonight. It'd be a nice thing. They bring presents. One time, I got this pair of house shoes...no..wait....that was my aunt that gave me those...Ah well. She looks like a monkey anyway...  Goooood Bye! Adios, muchachas! Arevoi, and I know that spelled that wrong and stuff...ah well. Good bye, in the many languages of the world.  I (heart) you all!

       And it's early in the morning...I am tired. I have slept all day and have paid the consequences. My right leg is in a horrible cramp and I feel that if I have to live with my sister one more day...I might just do something drastic...like...never mind...I don't do drastic things...but my sister routinely fills my annoyance quotient for the day. Yet, I manage to put up with it. Why..I have no..idea.  Life...is dull...  My mom bought me a cheap skateboard today...the wheels are too tight and the trucks are a bit loose...I can barely stand on the thing. Congratulations to me.   Friends make the world go round...  I heard that somewhere. A secret...it's true.   I got these cool pens today too. They have clear ink, but when you write with them, they turn either blue, pink, purple, or black. They are nice.  For once I wish the phone would ring for me instead of my sad little sis.   The drawing on my wall that a friend did is cool. It needs color..badly...and maybe I'll take it down, with his permission, and color it. I have good coloring skills. Not to mention an extensive collection of very nice colored pencils.   I draw faeries. They're pretty. Amy Brown draws faeries, too. I wish I was as good a faerie drawer as she.   I need to find someone who gives guitar lessons. My guitar is getting dusty.   Good night, or good morning.  Let's hope this war ends soon and no one, except Sadam, loses their lives.  If you didn't know..I'm not for this war. I hate war. I don't like to talk about it.

        2 Calories, Not Enough  On iTunes: System of a Down- Toxicity On PS2: Dynasty Warriors 4 (Soon, precious, soon) Mood: Mmm...lazy  Holy moly...just had another one of my Uber Gaming Fest weekends. Yesterday I gamed from...oh, 1 pm to 1 am. Rawk.  And at the moment, I'm just quietly enjoying myself, reading some bookage, listening to some moozic, dreading the next week of school, and plotting to buy Dynasty Warriors 4.  Just picked up the Tome of Horrors, an utterly badass monster-adding-supplement for d20. It's seemed to include all my favorite monsters that weren't put into the monster manual. Despite the $30 price tag, I believe it's money well spent for the 500 or so monsters included therein.  Amanda, post something! My brain is empty.  -Dice Squirrel Mellow Like Jello

Hell, I've already got the background for the lil fella (Rasca) written, as well as his description, and even an alias or two for various RPing uses. Fun stuff.

        The Best Sins!  On iPod: Cat Stevens- Wild World On PS2: Stiiiill waiting Mood: Gigglish  Another gem from Lore Sjoberg:  Sloth I'm big on sloth. Sloth is cheap, and easy to get. You need a partner or at least an object to get the most out of lust, gluttony and avarice both take something of a financial investment, but sloth is damned convenient. You can get in some quality sloth in your own bedroom, watching TV or even at the office. And if anyone gives you a hard time about it, just point out that by doing nothing, you're helping to slow down the endless march of entropy and delay the eventual heat death of the universe. B+  Gluttony Most people group sloth and gluttony together as the Slob Sins, but the fact is that your dedicated glutton puts a lot of effort into his or her sin. Finding the stores with the pillowcase-sized bags of potato chips, checking out which lunch buffets shut down at 2:00 and which go on until 3:30, taping Nabisco commercials--gluttony can be hard work. Take time out to give a glutton you know a pat on the back and a bite of your sandwich, just to say "Hey, thanks for being a glutton." C+  Wrath Lousy sin. Unsociable, bad on the nerves, and drives property values down. And what do you have to show for it? An ulcer and bruised knuckles, that's what. And it's so vulgar. Take it from me, pass on the wrath. Not only will you be less damned, you'll be happier. D  Lust Ah, lust. Putting the "deadly" back into the Seven Deadly Sins. The nasty thing is that while you need to trade liquids to get dead from lust, all you have to do to be damned to eternal hellfire and torment is lust in your heart. Talk about insult to injury. I lust in my heart all the time-- heart, brain, endocrine glands, the whole shebang. Even if I WANTED to not lust, I'm not sure how I'd go about it. Still, of all the deadly sins, this one is its own reward. B  Pride I'm not sure how this one works. Is plain old everyday pride sinful or do you have to get into the realm of hubris before you're in trouble? Do you go to hell for saying "this is a pretty tasty three-bean salad I've made, if I do say so myself," or do you have to say "why, I bet this is a better three-bean salad than GOD could make"? And what about self-esteem? My high school counselors were always pushing self-esteem on me. Were they pawns of the Adversary? So many questions. C  Envy This is another of those thinking sins. Do you get damned for THINKING about another slice of pie? Do you burn for CONSIDERING hitting the snooze alarm? No, of course not, but all you have to do is covet something of someone else's and boom, you're a brimstone hors d'oeuvre. You don't have to lay a HAND on your neighbor's manservant to get the ecclesiastical zot. There should really be some sort of appeals process. C-  Avarice Also known as greed. Got a lot of good press in the eighties. Still has a lot of supporters. If gluttony were as popular as greed the snack food industry would own us all like so much stacked firewood. The problem with avarice is that it gets pretty ludicrous pretty quickly. From billionaires buying a dozen gold cadillacs to bozos gushing over costume jewelry on the Home Shopping Network, greedy people inevitably end up looking goofy in public.

        Trials and Hackulations  On iPod: Queen- You're My Best Friend On PS2: Dynasty Warriors 4  Thank the Good Dude. I have been hacking lots of Ancient Chinese Ass for about 10 hours straight. My God. Let me educate you on the rules of Dynasty Warriors:  1. Hack 2. Hack some more 3. Wonder if there is anything else to the game other than hacking 4. Decide you don't care 5. Hack 6. Repeat  I swear, it really is an infinite loop. There is far too much game to this game...it has an ungawdly replay value, especially if you're one of those "100% Completion" people.  On another note, Imperian is out, I have played far too little of it on account of the DW4 and the presence of a cousin who hates text based games (and loves DW4.)  On another another note, school is a bitch, but it will relent in about...oh, five weeks or so. So until then, I study, hack sparingly, and get on the honor roll.  -Dice Squirrel Hack Jockey

Now that we've got that out of the way, we'll get on to the inquiry: No, Imperian is not made by the Achaea people, but it does use the Rapture Engine, which is what Achaea pioneered. So, it has the same base classes, but with new additions, a new world, new gods, and a new way of doing things. Much more RPing, much more balanced guilds and skills, and of course, that weird addicting element of most good MUDs that's hard to pin down.  Good God, I'm still entrenched in the addiction that is Dynasty Warriors. What the hell is with those chinese bastards that makes me love them so?  -Dice Squirrel Nothing But Hot Air

More RPing than you can shake a stick at. I bought some credits, went wild with craziness once I realized how cool all the Arboreal (druids, basically) skills are, then went even wilder with supercraziness once Asaka, Goddess of the Wild chose Rasca (my character) to be in her Divine Order. Man, role playing up the wazoo pays off in scads, and is fun too.  I have a feeling that the Godfavors are gonna be coming in short order. Hella badass.  Dynasty Warriors 4 STILL rocks, and I'm still playing it. I foresee I'll be playing it for years to come, what with the immense replay value.

       Playing Imperian affects the brain in very bad ways. It causes people to be slower in response in simple conversation and causes neglect of fiancees in other games.

Bug collecting is in full season at Jesuit. 50 freakin' bugs...way too many to ever be in one place at one time in one reality, if you ask me. I think there should be three bugs TOTAL. Despite this looming grade, I still manage Imperian up the wazoo. The lil bugger Rasca's really taken a grip on me. He's sooo fun to roleplay...to be honest, in Joe's campaign I could do with a lot more roleplaying scenes and activities, and a lot less combat. I -would- RP all the frickin' time, and I keep on trying to nudge him into my direction of playing, but I haven't had any luck so far. And to make it worse, I hardly get the chance now! We enter into combat before anything significant can ever happen! Aieee! Woe is me.  And if I -were- to have this much combat and not go insane with my lack of rocking-ness, I would have to play as a combat-centric character. But here's the catch 22: I'm beginning to really really hate making new characters only to have Joe declair them overly godlike and kill them in some really gruesome/annoying/dumb way.

        Dice Squirrel's Matrix Reloaded Review   Okay. I'll try to skimp on the spoilers, but it's like this...  This movie is fucking badass. Let me explain: It starts out with a slam-bam beginning, straight into action. This makes the Squirrel happy. Then it lapses into a long period without any ass kicking. This makes the Squirrel slightly perturbed, but it wasn't so bad, seeing as you got to see some seriously nifty sets and got a look at how Zion flows. It's a pretty badass place, really. After a half hour or so of gab, Zion-style-rave parties/Eucharist, and schmoozing with the high muckymucks of Zion, Neo and the crew go out to kick some ass, slow-motion style. We now enter what I'd like to call the: HOLY FUCK! portion of the movie. I call it this, because that is mainly what will be on your mind. I can't exactly remember how long this lasted, but I do remember that it lasted a long damn time. Some highlights:  Dude! Vampires! Sweet!  Dude! Really really tight plastic dress thing! Sweet!  Dude! Orgasm-cake! What the hell?! Sweet!  Dude! That car totally hit that other car! Sweet!  Dude! Whoa, that explosion rocked my world! Sweet!  and finally:  YES!!!  I'll let you figure out on your own what section of the movie the YES!!! was for. It should be pretty obvious.  Oh, and about all those people who said Reloaded didn't have as cool a story as the first Matrix? They can go to hell. The Matrix Numero Uno was great because it set up this absolutely amazing world and backstory. Reloaded builds off of that, and adds in this kind of creepy metaphysical, metaphorical, metasweetical aspect to it all. I don't really understand the majority of it... yet . I need to see the movie another 15 times or so, then I can start philosophizing (sic?).   -Dice Squirrel  Post script: there's this part where Neo kicks this guy, and the guy flies through a frickin' glass brick window.

        Zappo   I'm on a sci-fi binge, I swear. All of this RIFTS gaming is rocking my socks at the moment. Rail guns, particle cannons, laser pistols, the whole shabam!  Love it all.  Sadly enough, I'm also getting caught up in Magic again (the card game.) Damnit Brian, it's all your fault. We play Magic before and after all of our weekly D&D games, and my old, tired decks are getting...well, tired.  So I buy new cards. The cycle begins anew. It will control me. I am entering the slow spiral into madness.  -Squirrel

        I need to do this more often.   Dudes, dudettes, and other sundry creatures. I'm sorry for my silence.  I really don't have much of an excuse, seeing as I spend about 4 to 5 hours a day on the internet...let's be honest, on Imperian. My gaming life has eclipsed my geek life, as paradoxical as that is. I simply spend too much time on geeky activities, and not enough time blogging  about  them.  On a similar note, if anyone is in the Dallas area, every 1st Saturday of the month I run a Rifts campaign at Lone Star Comics, the local geek conservatory. Dice will roll, mega-damage will flow like milk and honey, and post-apocalyptic roleplaying will fill impressionable young minds (as well as a few corrupted older ones.)  Squirrel  More to come...maybe

        Firstly, post again on my blog, Nick, and you'll never get your Evangelion DVDs back   Ahem. After we've got  that   out of the way...  I'm over at Brian's place, with Joe, playing Magic. Damn, those guys have an assload of cards. I mean, it dwarfs my own collection of (maybe) 1000 cards or so. Sure, 1000 cards might be nice, but that's not taking into consideration the fact that 99.9% of them suck. Majorly. In fact, they defy physics by both sucking AND blowing.  I always get so depressed thinking about how meager my Magic decks are. I mean, hardly a cohesive strategy in the lot. I'm looking at both Brian and Joe's binders of cards, and whimpering with each page I turn. It's truly frightening, the array of madness that those two control.  In other news, I've been  slacking off something fierce at school, yet still maintaining good grades. With my luck, that strategy will last for about 5 more minutes. Still making time for Imperian, of course. The Rasca-naut romps about the realm for about 2 or 3 hours a day, and this pleaseth the Caleb. Though if it were up to me, I'd take the two classes I enjoy at school, go home, and play God in Imperian the rest of the day (with healthy doses of RPGing and Mt:Ging in the evening, with this sorry lot of geeks [read: awesome d00ds])  "Any words from the rabble while I'm up on my internet soapbox?" I ask them.  "Tell them, 'Tear my life to pieces, this is my last resort.'" Joe merely chuckles and repeats Brian's punchline. Oh, that Joe.  "Joe, speak to the people." says I.  "Greetings, fools. It is I. The Guy. I have come to tell you... that burying dead hookers in the middle of the Nevada Desert is a bad idea." says  he. I shake my head and type willingly, disapproving all the while. Oh, that Joe. He is ever so silly.  -Squirrel, signing out  PS: I saw a badass bumper sticker, saying, "I talk with the squirrels. Ch-koo! Ch-koo!"

Today...rather...a few moments ago...I realised that I am a true idjut. NO, not an idiot...but...an idjut. In fact, I've gone to supreme Idjut status. I am officially queen of Idjuts.   I forgot which damn site to update the damn blogs on...*sighs*...kill me...now...   Anywho....   Caleb, you can't complain about magic decks...I get depressed on the simple fact that I don't have one. ..yet..given a deck that I understand well enough...I RULE...but  I dun have my own flippin' deck..  And you have no more bragging rights of slackerness...I passed Pre-Algebra in the seventh grade with a B and never did homework the entire year. Boo-yah.   Also, two to three hours on Imperian? Hah! I was on Achaea and Imperian at the same time last Wednsday from five in the evening to six in the morning. And from five till four the next day. I've got joo beat silly.   ANYWHO!  Monday I'm going to the ICP concert here in Nashville....it's part of the Wicked Wonka tour and I'm like...uber psyched. Remind me to get a picture of me before the concert with my hair in dreds and my face painted. It'll look kickass. And don't let me forget to get one -after- the concert...that one would be even more fun.  .HACK// infection has been one hell of a cool game...so far...and I've not even gotten to the interesting parts....and I still have yet to play mutation...and whatever the third one's called. It's all thanks to my lovely friend that I'm spending the weekend with. Oh joy..oh..rapture...oh..glee......     .....  Yeah....so....yeeeeeah.....  I'm out.  Princess of Idjiotic Pandas, Panda, Accepting applications for sanity    oh...and I forgot...  Bitch, ain't I sexy? Wanna take a ride in my lexi? Well I ain't got a lexi! I got a taxi!

        [Witty, yet meaningful title, with delightfully geeky tinge]  On iTunes: Black Heart, by Calexico  My condolences for the Fill In Your Own Goddamn Title of tonight's post. You see, all my synapses are engaged in pondering the deeper meaning of...    THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS    That's right folks, it's time for the Dice Squirrel to review the last in the "Woah..." trilogy.  Once again, on opening night (this night) I saw the Matrix. Upon getting the tickets, I did some sort of a jig. I'm not sure.  We'll start from the start, and go from there. Bear with me folks, I'm still not altogether here, most of me is still thinking furiously. I'm pretty sure the opening had something to do with the really intense I'm Out of the Matrix, and Really Intense About It people. Hovercraft, tunnels, shots of various vaguely ethnic-looking people, along with a few dyke-y females. Very strange sequence (probably because I'm still halucinating from all the strobing gunfire of the last half of the movie) , all in all, but at least it had some purpose to it, which is more than I can say about most of Reloaded.  Then there was something about trains, Indian people, and hobos. I believe there was a chase scene stuck in there somewhere. Then the old actress of the Oracle dies and they make up some really shitty plot devices to explain the not at all similar replacement black lady (though she still looks like she could advertise for Real Home Cooking Maple Syrup.)  I'm losing the really hysterical (at the time I thought of them) bits of the blog, so I'll summarize the plot very quickly: Neo walks around, looking like he's higher than a cat's back; the Council of Zion and the People of Zion act out a few scenes straight out of some Star Trek thing somewhere sometime; there's a very long (and fucking badass, I should add) fight scene between humanity and machinity.  Right, on to my making fun of several parts of the movie.  I was the only person in the sold out theater who broke out laughing when all hell was breaking loose in Zion. It's one of those things where the camera focuses on a nobody soldier, who's saying something like, "Sweet baby Jesu--" while another random soldier gets thrown across the screen, screaming. If I had a nickel for every time they used that damn scream sound bit...  Also, the movie actually uses a cliche it has created. Normally, that's not cool. Here, it's not cool. I don't know what they were thinking. Trinity does her little Jump Up Into the Air, Pause, Spin 360, Unpause, Kick the Guy In the Face thing. Again.   Also also, the machine city looks very similar to every other Evil City. Spiky towers, dark clouds, lightning, flying nasties, and a Head Honcho with a really deep, loud, resonating voice. Though the big floating Head Honcho of Revolutions is quite nifty, I must admit.  All in all, I loved the movie. It'll take a few more viewings and a few more days for me to realize the scenes I really adore, but I'm pretty sure they all have something to do with Kicking Ass.  SQUIRREL'S OFFICIAL-ESQUE RATINGS: Boom Factor:10 Cliche Factor: 3 or 4 Dear God, All This Gunfire, Rain, and Electrical Flashing Is Going to Give Me a Stroke: 5 What You Should Really Pay Attention To: 8...no, 9.

        So it begins  On iTunes: Calexico-- Si Tu Disais  Can you believe how long it's been? Last time I posted, the Matrix was still cool. That was back in the Victorian era, wasn't it?  Anyways, I won't make any promises this time. One, two, possibly thirty posts a month, that's all you're going to get.  Here's the skinny: Finals are just two weeks away, and I'm stressing on some deep internal level that I can't access right now. Good? I hope so.  I'm going nuts with T'kal Zahara, the latest in a long line of my pure-bred D&D badasses. I'm reading tons of Forgotten Realms books (8 so far) for some extra experience points, writing a short-story-esque history for him, creating a stronghold and detailing it better than most small press companies would detail a product, creating cohorts and baddies for him, hell, even writing canon for his god. I'm over the top, I know. But damn am I having a blast with it. It certainly gives a good way to vent all of my destructive tendencies, through this treacherous little backstabber (6d6 damage worth of backstabbing, by golly!)  I'm stalling out in Imperian. I don't know what the problem is, I'm just not very enthusiastic about it today.  Brian got a new job as a teacher, so that's nice, he'll be starving shortly I'm sure, with a salary like that. Well, that's not true. He'll be in jail, after he eats all the kiddos.  Abrupt, Caleb  Thought I was done, didn't you? Not so. Just wanted to say: don't freak out, but I changed the template. Okay, freak out if you want. But I'll be tinkering with it for a while, to see what all it can do.

       There is a Dude, and He is bodacious.  I got the new Calexico EP, Convict Pool, and it's extremely cool, continuing the fine time-honored tradition of Calexico Rockage.  Alone Again Or is completely unlike anything they've done yet, and they're covering someone's work, I just can't tell who. It's odd, but good. Not as good as their other stuff, though.  Convict Pool is very solid, a great rhythm and some solid singing, even if the lyrics are a bit... awkward.  Si Tu Disais is one of those eargasm songs. Definitely in their top 5. I cannot describe it further, it simply makes me close my eyes and sway when I'm listening with the Pod.  Corona is a delightful little romp, one of those north mexican polkas. The only polka they've done, from what I've heard. And one is enough. This one polka, good. Any more, and we'll see.  Praskovia is, in a word, FUCKED UP. I LOVE IT.  It's this discombobulated accordion music laying down the beat of a waltz, while ... how would I describe this guitar... the notes get under your skin and just make you shiver. It's like some sort of maniacal circus music where they lock the doors on you and make you watch as elephants have knife fights and clowns mutilate small animals. Really goddam solid instrumentals, these people are my gods  I've added to this analogy of a deranged and homicidal circus: imagine, if you will, a highwire, where bizarre sexual acts between two contortionists are taking place. That guitar music? Being played by a hideous, potbellied ringleader with fingernails like claws. The bastard is practically TEARING the notes out of the guitar. That's how it sounds. Oh, and the accordions? Being played by zombified, brain-hungering koalas, echidnas, and giraffes, all of them riding a merry-go-round with decapitated horses.  Yeah, it's a great song. Get the album, just for this. It so needs a wild music video, directed by yours truly.  And finally, Sirena is another perfect, high-spirited Calexico song, with a cool mythical theme.  They're coming back into town in September, I believe. No, I take it back, they're coming to Austin, but who the hell cares? Close enough for me, I'll be making my journey to Mecca to listen to those gods of rock. If you want a taste, go to their  urlLink site  and take a look at the mp3s section.  I hate to take a moment and go off on a tangent about  myself , but here goes. I'm a bit miffed at how things are turning out, life-wise. I have too much to do, and not enough time to do it in. Getting driver's ed, school, studying, reading, I finally want to write really badly, and a dozen little knick-knacky things with games, which is ridiculous, but I still want to indulge myself.  That, along with all the responsibilities to home and such. Meeting someone lovely and nice to laugh and have a good time with seems like a pipedream at this point, but fingers crossed.

        Washed my face in the rivers of Empire   Nevermind about that slump, I'm back at it. Perhaps not as vehemently as before, but I'm trying. Devout little Rasca put in his application for Senior Missionary of the Clerics last night, and I'll probably get it. It'll be good to get back into a guild leadership position, the last non-GM one I held was like 10 in-game years ago. Well, more like 5 in-game years ago, but I miss it. The power, the women, the fast cars...  I'm working on a new blog for my numerous D&D campaigns. I've been thinking about how it should work, and I've come down to this: an introductory post, very seductive and sexy with geek details, for each campaign; individual posts giving character bios; posts after game sessions recounting the events; posts of game history, extra XP opportunity assignments, and so on. The important ones I can put in a sidebar, permalinking to the posts. That should do it.  I've also been working on getting someone to read this damned thing. Brian, I appreciate the zealous audience of one, but all this HTML needs some company.  Time for escuela, which I believe ends quite shortly, not next thursday, but the thursday after. That thursday also marks the first session of the renewed Underdark campaign, so look for details at hacktastic.blogspot.com

       First of all, I hate canoe trips. You abandon civilization and magic technology so that you can... work out your upper body for 6 hours, get sunburned, and listen to your dad barking, "Paddle, paddle! Paddle right, paddle left, brake brake brake! C'mon!" You know what? Paddling gets old.  Second of all, I hate dealing with a sunburn. It's like an angry red reminder that I just wasted my saturday paddling a canoe in the company of a stepmother whose primary concern in life is which celebrity is dating which other celebrity, and a father who gave me 40 bucks and a T-shirt that doesn't fit for my birthday present. My 16th birthday. Now, I wasn't expecting a SAAB or space shuttle or something, but it would've been nice if he gave me a present that insinuated that my own father knows me. Just a pipedream, I guess.  You may have drawn from this digression that my weekend wasn't very fun. You may be correct. I just keep telling myself, "Two more years, two more years and I'll be hundreds of miles away." That and, "Two more weeks, two more weeks and I won't have to even  think  about sines, cosines, tangents, or diethyl-cyclohexatriol."  Wow, listen to me! Bitch bitch bitch. I should lighten up.  In other (lighter) news, Calexico is coming back to Texas (Austin) in September, so I'm psyched.  Oh, funny story about my sun-scorchedness. I was taking a shower (lewd!), thinking about something (not lewd, honest), and basically cleaning myself on autopilot. Hand takes scrubby-lufa-thing. Hand puts soap on scrubby-lufa-thing. Hand scrubs sunburnt arm with scrubby-lufa-thing. Eyes widen. Mouth screams. Brain says, "Shit."

       Humanity needs to get with the program.  A friend of mine, Sifat, has a terrible, horrible family. I can understand a mother's anger at a daughter who doesn't clean her room after being asked. I can't understand a mother who would break her daughter's finger by swinging a rolling pin at her because of that. They're really zealous moslems, and I don't know, does Allah promote child abuse? This is not a solitary event, this is nearly nightly. Does rage make a sound? If so, I make it. I offered her room and board should she ever want to run away, but I wish I could do more.  I was talking to another friend, Rob, fuming at the sort of things her family does. I made the connection that maybe, just maybe, it's not stereotypical that moslems are completely and totally fucked up! Case in point, Sifat's family. She's the only sane one. Next, we have the middle east. They have been in a stone age state of petty squabbling and tribal warfare for 2000 goddam years. I can understand their anger at the West. I can't understand flying a plane into a building and killing thousands. We need to build a wall around the whole middle east and take it down in 100 years to see if they've killed each other off yet. Jesus. By that reasoning, the US needs a wall around it, too. The firebombing of Dresden. Two atomic bombs dropped on Japan. Slavery.  By that reasoning, the entire WORLD needs a wall around it! Humanity is just so incredibly terrible to itself. It really does make me cry sometimes, at the enormity and impossibility of the change needed to make the world a nice place to live in. The US uses up 60% of the world's resources. Where is the justice? Religion teaches love, tolerance, and faith in God, and then turns around, starts holy wars and condemns entire subsets of humanity just because they find guys cute rather than girls.  I'm trying to think, I'm trying to figure out just how I can change this, alone. Is it possible? If I help with solving world hunger, or even solving the hunger of one country, will that help in the end? If I turn to God and preach this message to others, will anyone listen? If I go into politics, will I be able to rise to a high enough position to make changes for the better? If I go into medicine, am I going operate on someone, save their life, and let them go out and hate some more? It's a damn big philosophical question.  I'm going to study for finals, make A's, and finish my sophomore year of high school. I'll figure out the rest later. Meanwhile, be nice to each other, it's the best thing you can do.

       Well, it's not -that- harsh, I'm betting. But regardless, I've put out applications for almost a dozen jobs now. How many do I want? None. How many would I not mind doing? Maybe one or two. A bookstore would be cool, as would selling newspapers door-to-door. Get some sun, get some walking in, get some fresh air. Not a bad way to make some money.  Anyways, the summer is also looking busy. Driver's Ed., strength and conditioning camp at Jesuit, a bajillion handy-man jobs around both households, and of course, wooing ze ladies and playing ze games. Oh, and my dad is talking about studying for SAT stuff, but he's nuts. Unfortunately, he's nuts -and- controls my tuition at Jesuit.  Ugh, I'm hot and tired and I don't think I can write much more. I got my groove back with Imperian, I'm having a blast with Brian and the crew, and I... am going to take a nap... so... tir...zzzzzz...  Sincerely, Zzzzz...

       Beck-- Mutations David Bowie-- Best of Bowie DVD-- Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back DVD-- Total Recall Books-- 2 and 3 of  The Dark Elf Trilogy  (Man R.A. Salvatore is a hack, or at least close to being one. His saving grace is that lots of things die in his books. I only buy them for the XPs in Brian's game. *such a WHORE!*) Book-- Greg Bear's  Infinity Concerto  Misc-- a little silver-covered journal Misc-- $2/gallon gas! Gah!  And I need to buy credits in Imperian, soon. And find a job, though I hate that.  Oh, speaking of jobs: Eric Clapton is coming to Dallas, and of course, like 50 other awesome musicians are travelling with him. It's another of those "Crossroads" tours, like the one he did in the 70s. BB King, Jeff Beck, Clapton, and a dozen other names that leapt out at me (that I forget now.) Why do I comment on this? Because I'm going? No. But I -am- going to be working a booth with Pat at the convention that is going to spring up behind the concert, like fungus springing up in the doo doo left by the passing of a cow. I'll never sneer at 10 bucks an hour.

       The power across all north Dallas was out for a good 36 hours, at least in my humble burg. Surprisingly, I had a rather jolly time in the dark. Got some candles and tin foil and made a makeshift light source for myself (the tin foil reflects it and essentially doubles your light. Huzzah!) So, I read until about midnight both nights, and blew through two books. Oh, and yesterday I worked some odd jobs for Pat, making 20 bucks or so. So it begins, my career as a hungry 16-year-old.  Brian brings up a good topic in his last comment, so I'll put my spin on it.  "In America, If you work hard and persevere, your dreams will come true."  First, let's make a few things crystal clear. Your dreams have to be somewhat reasonable. A poor, muscle-bound Austrian immigrant may be able to realize his dreams of becoming governer, but he's still a long way away from becoming President, especially considering he isn't a natural-born citizen. Alas! So, some dreams are impossible to translate into reality.  Next, you have to work hard, persevere, and have some circumstances on your side. That's the other part of the deal. I doubt Benjamin Franklin would have gone from his printshop apprenticeship to America's ambassador and acclaimed writer and inventor if he was... say... black. He would be just as brilliant, but he probably wouldn't be in the textbooks. That's the sad truth of it. But on the whole, I do agree that through hard work and perseverance, anyone in this day and age can use the system to find limitless (nearly so) success. Just look at that guy on American Idol or one of those damn singing shows. You know, the asian engineering student who sang "She Bangs." He SUCKS. But he persevered and got on national television, and now he's an international superstar of suckdom. Anyways, it's impossible to refute the "work hard and persevere" thing, because it's happened too many times to count. The rags to riches story is true. Why, if I wanted to have a nervous breakdown and end up on drugs, I could probably forsake all fun and dive headfirst into school, being the captain of two varsity teams, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, homecoming king, straight A's, national merit finalist, 1600 SAT, all that, and go to Stanford. At that point, I would of course EXPLODE. I like the way I'm doing things now. A average, I'm well-balanced, I haven't gotten any girl pregnant (yet), and most of all, I'm happy. I'll go to a good college, but not a great one, and I won't be a coke-sniffing CEO when I grow up. I can live with that. I can live with a rather humble existence, actually. My dreams aren't that hard to make come true, thank the Good Dude.  The Dude Abides.

       I feel like my spine is going to crush itself, and my feet are like little round potatoes of pain. Good news, though: Saw JJ Cale, Carlos Santana, John Mayer, Eric Clapton (again). Listened to the once in a lifetime performance of JJ Cale and Clapton together. Oh, and I got a little job with Randy the Master Framer. That may turn into a long-time assistant's job, but who knows? I'll just troubleshoot OSX and teach him the ropes of the Mac for a few hours, and organize his new Powerbook. Yum.  Another day, another dollar.

       I got up early. I got to Fair Park. I set up the booth. I worked for 11 hours. During some of that time, I went and saw Jimmy Page's guitar. Baby blue, metallic, and sweet. I can imagine it singing Stairway. I also came within 6 feet of Eric Clapton, his wife, and his entourage. He bought cowboy boots in the booth behind ours, and I never saw him. We're selling prints of old blues musicians and jazz guys, along with some weirder (hysterical) things by George Toomer. Buffalo George, we call him. For instance: Giant Platypus flying through space. "Gallant Gals of Guadalcanal." "Don't fuck with granny!"  Greatness.  Another day, another dollar.  (JIMMY PAGE'S GUITAR  AND  ERIC CLAPTON IN ONE DAY!)

       By the way, ask me about the *expletive* Sound Enhancer. I'll tell you  all  about it. I can't adequately bitch here.

       Well, it's over. My back is shattered in 92 different locations (I'm pretty sure), and my feet are the size of tennis rackets, and just as flat. No star spottings today, I'm afraid, but we sold about three times as much as the other two days combined. Also, that OSX consulting job is certain now, so huzzah!  Damn, my mom is so weird. She doesn't want to go see the last great rock and roll concert on Earth, despite our having enough passes. I don't even care if I don't drool over Jeff Beck, when you have him, JJ Cale, and Eric Clapton on stage, with BB King thrown in for good measure,  magic  is going to happen. So fingers crossed on her changing her mind.  I have -got- to tell Rachel about Jimmy Page's guitar, that shit is  wild . The man did Stairway to Heaven.  And did you know that the concert today is 11 hours long? The History Channel is there filming, and they're going to almost immediately re-broadcast the live performances, because it's the greatest rock concert of the decade, and perhaps... of our very civilization. But then again, they're prone to overstatements. Heh. Who knows, though? I don't think anyone besides Eric Clapton himself could gather all these great names together.  Another day, another dollar. (That's like, what... three dollars now!)

       That game is the shit! Google for it, and check it out. I'm a big Tetris junky, so that helps with my lust for the thing. I really get into it, I yarr, and I ahoy, and I avast ye scurvy dogs, etc etc. Fun stuff.

       Thank goodness no one reads this, because I'm actually sharing personal details of my life in this post! Wild! It's completely without precedent. I actually feel a little naughty about it.  I went out to the mall tonight with my home boy Fry, for dinner and a movie with some lovely ladies and some pimply fellas. I must say, I felt rather foxy. We ate chinese food and caught Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Surprise surprise, it was actually really funny, if you're juvenile (and I am!) Good ole Ben Stiller, he can really deliver the stupidity. This Jennie person, she was a blast. Fun, fabulous sense of humor (seeing as it meshes quite nicely with mine), and she is undoubtedly a nerd. Being with my People is nice. I get that solid sense of belonging, like at gaming conventions. (And she was cute, to boot! Good times, this evening.)  Oh, and I bought a sa-weet wristband that has an old skool 8 bit icon on it and the words: LEVEL UP! Oh, and the Nintendo logo on the back. It makes me hearken back to the days of Duck Hunt and Final Fantasy 1.  Ugh, tired.

       Guys, big news! Yeah yeah, I know I haven't posted here for a while, but that's because there's big doin's a-goin' on, ya'll. Ahem. I'll list.  1) Strength and conditioning: I'm working out 2 hours everyday at Jesuit's EXCELLENT weight room and track. And what's weird, or at least unexpected, is that I'm having fun, too! Granted, I lift a little more than a gnat and bench a little more than a mosquito, but I'm working on that side of it. I eat twice my weight in meat everyday to fuel such a venture.  2) Driver's ed: that's right, the Squirrel will be on the road shortly! Fear. Anyways, my driver's ed instructor is frickin' hysterical. For instance, today's lesson was Lesson Four: How To Die, and the Exciting Lives of Dead Kids. Friggin' awesome, man. We'll watch those sappy videos and laugh at the stupid kids who die because of stupid decisions. It's like one long Darwin Awards. I know that some of the kids were honestly killed because of other people's dumb decisions, but mostly... they're dumb. Drink and drive, j00 die. Get in the car with someone who's been drinking, j00 die. Race other cars in your  4 cylinder Camry because of testosterone poisoning, j00 die. I'm half offended, and half really really amused. It's a fun thing.  3) Awesome movies and ice cream: Jenny, David, a rotating cast of other fun people, and I have been frequenting this dollar theatre a lot, and there's of course more planned, all across the metroplex. They're the most fun, really. And Jenny, I'm so sorry about your broken foot! I doubt it'll be amputated, really. And if so, you're still off the charts, as far as your Supercool ranking goes.  4) NEW JOB! I'm working with David (Fry) at Voyager Expanded Learning, which is awesome. First of all, it pays 8 bucks an hour. Second of all, all I have to do is random office-monkey type things, and data entry with Excel. Third of all, it's for one of the best and coolest causes: teaching kids to read! I feel like a cog in a benign (rather than Terminator-esque) machine. A well-paid cog!  5) Clark's running an Eberron campaign, so I'm stoked for that. New world, new heroes, new villains, new -adventure-!  6) New threads. You know, I never actually call them threads.  I'm out.  Oh--!!! 7) DSL! Delicious. So very very fast.

        Now, I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.  Men, all this stuff you've heard about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of horse dung. Americans, traditionally, love to fight. All real Americans love the sting of battle.  When you were kids, you all admired the champion marble shooter, the fastest runner, the big league ball players, the toughest boxers. Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser. Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. Because the very thought of losing is hateful to Americans.  Now, an army is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, fights as a team. This individuality stuff is a bunch of crap. The biggest bastards who wrote that stuff about individuality for the Saturday Evening Post don't know anything more about real battle than they do about fornicating.  Now, we have the finest food and equipment, the best spirit, and the best men in the world. You know, by God, I actually pity those poor bastards we're going up against. By  God, I do. We're not just going to shoot the bastards. We're going to cut out their living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun bastards by the bushel.  Now, some of you boys, I know, are wondering whether or not you'll chicken-out under fire. Don't worry about it. I can assure you that you will all do your duty. The Nazis are the enemy. Wade into them. Spill their blood. Shoot them in the belly. When you put your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment before was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do.  Now there's another thing I want you to remember. I don't want to get any messages saying that we are holding our position. We're not holding anything. Let the Hun do that. We are advancing constantly and we're not interested in holding onto anything -- except the enemy. We're going to hold onto him by the nose, and we're gonna kick him in the ass. We're gonna kick the hell out of him all the time, and we're gonna go through him like crap through a goose!  Now, there's one thing that you men will be able to say  when you get back home -- and you may thank God for it. Thirty years from now when you're sitting around your fireside with your grandson on your knee, and he asks you, "What did you do in the great World War Two?" -- you won't have to say, "Well, I shoveled shit in Louisiana."  Alright now you sons-of-bitches, you know how I feel.    That guy's such a badass. Granted, a warmonger and probably a bad guy, but a badass nonetheless, like Stephan Seagal, or Jet Li, or Jason Statham.  The Transporter  was some pretty sweet stuff. Oh, and let us not forget the new reigning King Badass: Vin Diesel. Go see Pitch Black.

       That's a lot of chow mein and stirfry. I guess it makes more sense when I say it was for 8 hungry gamers and one ravenous GM. What makes me remember this is that all day at work I've been playing a little word/mind game for myself.  Here's how you too can play the Tim's A Pervert Game! After anything and everything you or someone else says, just imagine them (or you) saying, "... in bed!" at the end of it. It works with everything. I think.   Hey Caleb, good to see you... in bed!  Hey Caleb, keep up the good job... in bed!   Yeah... Tim has issues.  And for all you faithful fans who have been commenting (faithfully) on the blog, you have my eternal thanks and boundless love! However, I suck, and I haven't been reading them lately, but with more free time and a computer up at work, I'll be checking in rather frequently. So jabber at me... in bed!

       Things up at work are so sloooow today. I mean, besides me mailing out 100 letters that will mean 16 million dollars in Voyager's pocket. &nbsp; I think they've run out of work for me to do. Really, with the daily things I have to do, I have a good hour, hour and a half of work to do in a single day. Mostly in 15 minute increments. Frickin' IT is finally going to get me my own personal computer today, the slowboats. They said "in five minutes," so it'll be another hour, or perhaps a day. I'm not sure if I've broken their code yet. &nbsp; Fun stuff tonight, though! I'm going to see Captain Blood-- A Pirate Melodrama with the lovely Miss Casmus! Pirates, throwing popcorn, and scallywags. What can be better? &nbsp; *pause in writing for 10 minutes* &nbsp; Holy moly, 5 minutes actually meant 5 minutes. These IT people are  crafty . Back with an update soon.

       Okay, as if going to Cap'n Blood wasn't awesome enough (and it was: great food, great entertainment,  great  company), I had two, count'em, two games with the Hack Pack. We had pretty much a full group for both Joe's deathtastic game and Clark's rockin' Eberron game. Brian, Rob, Tim, me, Clark, Joe, Jay, Alex, and Jay's wife, Kim. I mean, frickin' A. That's a par-tay. &nbsp; Oh, as far as the deathtastic game? We all died. My middle-aged, balding halfling went out in the best way, though. He screamed "BONZAI!" and leapt into the very maw of this killer dragon, with two bandoleers of flaming oil strapped across his chest. That puppy&nbsp;lit up like a roman candle. He'll be feeling that one in the morning. Hopefully someone can recover my ashes. Oh well! &nbsp; In other, boring news, I got approved for some financial assistance from my school. Basically, so long as I work 100 hours for them over the course of the school year, they'll cut the tuition a bit... ... yay? I guess. The good news is that it keeps my dad and stepmom happy, and so long as I can maintain all the other stuff, I'll have pretty much free reign during the 15 minutes of free time I have every week. Hehe. &nbsp; Jam on, jam on!

        Hee hee! I'm sending out these forms to various school districts, and I just came across Clint ISD. It reminded me of a conversation I was having with the guys earlier this week.   "Yeah, Clint is a tricky name to say. Mispronounce it and people get angry or excited."   And it reminds me of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back... "I AM THE CLINT COMMANDER!"   Jay -did- say Clint, right? Or was it...

       Well, I don't really hate it, it just bugs me and makes me want to flail my arms and snarl.  When I'm at work, or anyplace that has hallways, people tend to walk down them, often right by me. When they pass, they flash a brief smile and say, not ask, "Hey Caleb, how's it goin'?" and then they're gone. No chance for me to reply. How should I tell whether or not is is in fact going, and if so, how it goes in two seconds or less? Doubleyew Tee Eff, seriously. It just bugs me. They don't even want to know how it's going.  I suggest a simple "Hi," or maybe a, "Yo!" Whatever floats your boat, really, so long as you don't expect them to answer a question in the half second you're still face to face.

       Why are they such a fun band to listen to? They were gods in the UK during their heyday, and every kid I've ever known had that CD with Wonderwall on it. That's probably what we'll reminisce about, heh. Seriously though, they make data entry tolerable, and that's saying something.  Dave Matthews has the capability to do the same, though I haven't brought any of his albums up here. I need to.  Brian, post a comment that will tantalize my readers with your new campaign idea. It sounds bad to the bone (I'm a fan of 80s expressions. Radical!) I'm thinking I'll either play the mystic theurge from your Cormyr game, or a dagger-throwing superspy (think a good version of T'kal's minion, The Dagger, with less homocidal tendencies), or possibly a spiked chain-wielding finesse fighter... though with that last option, I'm not sure where he'd come from, why he'd specialize in such an odd weapon, etc etc. I'll go through the FR Campaign Setting book and see if any of the countries or organizations leap out at me, for him.

       Lately I've had to get into a "Limited Fun" frame of mind. I wake up, do chores, get ready for the day, then go to work. I'm at work until 6pm, I go do whatever other errands I need to do, eat some dinner, and I'm back by 7-7:30 pm. Then, there's still work to be done. Household chores, or some essay that someone wants me to write, or some bank thing, or something... which leaves me 2 hours of fun per day, unless I want to concoct an amphetamine cocktail so I don't have to sleep. I'm not sure if that will even work. Hm.  I'm pretty sure summer didn't used to be like this. In fact, there were prolonged periods of boredom/intense game playing/book reading that went on in previous summers. This is ca-wazy! I sure hope the school year is better *grins* Fat chance o'that!  It's not SO bad, I guess. I'm just not used to it, and it'll probably stay this way for most of my life. I still manage to get out on the town a couple of times weekly, either with my bone thug Brian (and Co.) or my diggity dawg David, or with the charming miss Guinevere, all of whom rock mightily (in glorious Technicolor!)  By the way,  urlLink life is good!!!

       and when you touch down, you feel so much straaanger...  -Gotta- love The Byrds! Leo Kottke also did a KILLER version of the song.  Cool day today. I got my hair cut, Brian style, right to the skull... well, maybe I exaggerate, I haven't seen it since I got out of the barber shop. Here's my philosophy with hair:  1) It's just hair. 2) It grows back. 3) It's a pain to go to the barbershop, therefore going to the barbershop is best reserved for a monthly or month and a halfly activity.  Yup... the last time I got my hair cut was last month, almost to the day. I was just starting strength and conditioning camp, and I would have died running from excessive head heat.  The barber was a pretty funny guy... an extremely talkative HUGE black guy, about 21 years old. I had to stop myself from laughing, because I had just watched Scary Movie 1... which featured the huge gay black man. And this guy? Uh huh. But very nice, even though he thought I was cute... which I just might be! Hee hee!
