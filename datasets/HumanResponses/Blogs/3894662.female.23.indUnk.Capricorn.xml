       So this is my first entry into this blog... I'm not sure if anyone I know or anyone at all will ever read this.. (I'm not sure whether I want people to or not.) I mean obviously someone may stumble upon it out in "cyber world" but I don't care about them.. (No offense) It's those I know.. Those judging bastards.. Hhmm.. That was a little to harsh. Nah, it's just that I think this is more for me.. A way to settle some of my scary little demons and get them all straight in a row. Latelty, I don't feel like I have anyone that I can really ramble at anymore. Everyone is very busy and also probably very tired of my insanity. (It can be exhausting)   I think that I may be bored of my life. Which is very well possible since I don't do much and what I do do I doubt would be considered exciting. I look at my friends.. They are getting married some are having babies and I just don't feel like I fit that mold. It seems like a nice mold but it seems a little claustrophobic to me. I want to run away.. Go to some cute little town by the water. I want to be that girl.. The strange one that people are drawn to. I want to hang out with interesting people are do crazy things. I want to not have anymore emotional ties than necsaary. I don't seem to be well equipped to deal with emotional stuff. I seem to be a relationship assinator.. Everything from friendships, boyfriends to families.. I'm like a serial relationship killer. I should really be stopped. I would like to be one of those happy little women who smile and laugh at everything there man says and get married, spend entirely to much on a wedding, wear a big white dress and have babies. Attend PTA meetings in my suv.. But... I think they know that I'm a fraud. My boyfriend certainly does.. I think I was able to fool him long enough for us to move in together but he now seems to be keenly aware that I'm not what he thought he was signing up for. I think that he feels that he has been a victim of false advertising. I guess in a way he has been. But, so have I. I guess I'm at that age where I'm supposed to be at a cross road. I mean I think by now I should certainly know what I want to do with the rest of my life. I'm scared that I'm going to regret my choices and whish I dove deeper. But the diving is scary and I'm not sure that I want to do it alone. I wonder if it is normal to be afraid of your dreams. It's probably not. I'm told constantly that most of the things that I think or not normal..   So.. It's 1 in the morning and I can't sleep not that I would want to even if I could because the boyfriend is in the bedroom and he is not talking to me. I'm not so sure as to what I did.. And he wont tell me.. I asked him, but he didn't seem to entirely know himself. Which makes it difficult for me to apologize and for him to move on. So, I'm guessing we just aren't going to talk. I hate fighting. Well.. That is not entirely true. I like fighting as long as it is going my way and I think I'm really right. (because I will fight even when I know I'm wrong) I'm just sick of it.. I just want to get along and live peaceful.. at least some of the time. I hate this whole we live together but I'm not entirely sure as to why since we don't seem to like each other very much. He says that he loves me.. And god bless him for loving me. But, I think that he is having a very hard time loving me. (I can be hard to love.. Just ask my parents) So anyway.. I would like to go in there and just snuggle with him and go to bed especially since we had a pretty good day (which are rare) But that doesn't seem to be happening so I'm uncomfortable. And I shouldn't be uncomfortable.. I live here to damnit! But I think me waking him up to tell him that I'm uncomfortable and that he is infringing on my rights to be happy may not help the situation. So I will instead stay up half of the night over analyzing everything that happened and obsessing over every possibility of what may happen tomorrow.. UUgghh..
