      Terry, Jill and I went to the Hospital this morning just in time when Rhonda was just about to have her labour induced. Jeff actually went into the room, I was surprised, because Jeff and I both have a low tolerance for things like that. He said it wasn't so bad.  Anyway, they had a girl. They have two girls now, and Rhonda got her tubes tied afterwards. Jeff named the baby Madison Nicole.....after me, his only sister. I thought that was sweet.

      It's been an interesting weekend. I worked all weekend of course. Sometimes I feel like I'm missing out on much of my high school life because I work so much. Everyone at work always tells me that I should just take one or two shifts a week because my parents have money. I'm not a mooch, and if I'm going to have a job I might as well make as much as I can. Since this year will be my graduating year, I will likely cut my shifts in half since school will be starting and I want to have as much fun with my friends this year as possible.  Friday night I went to work and there was a strange, tense feeling going around. The owner and his wife had just found out that their 3 month old daughter has lukemia a couple of days ago. He is 35 and she is 37 or so, they'd gotten married about 2 years ago and she'd been trying to get pregnant the whole time and even went on fertility drugs to get pregnant. She is going to spend the next year in the Hospital in Halifax. I think it's safe to say the Boss's wife won't be coming back to work after all of her maternity leave is up. I didn't think she would anyway&nbsp;because she was excited to be a parent and would want to spend her time with her kid, but now I definately know she won't be coming back. He will be scarcely seen around the store now, too.  My&nbsp;brother's wife&nbsp;is going in to the hospital on Wednesday to have her labour induced, and all I could think of is that something like this could happen to my new neice/nephew and it's scary. Anyway, I booked Wednesday off work so I could go over to the hospital with my brother. It's their 2nd child and she's only 23 and he's&nbsp;going to be 25 next month and they're married and have a huge income. I'm pretty proud of them.  Next week I start driving school, I have my beginners but I'm going to go anyway so I can learn how to drive properly, the classroom part is going to be a waste but ah well.  After work I went to go see my Nanny tonight, I haven't been there since Papa passed away in May. It was so weird, but she's doing well. I've been thinking of asking her for one of Papa's old record players or something because one of the biggest things I remember about him is him listening to classical music.  I'm in a weird mood tonight.  &nbsp;

      I had an interesting conversation with one of the new girls at work tonight. She's my age, and she just got hired about two weeks ago. She's your typical middle-class teenager, pretty, friendly, smart. We were talking about jail and prison, and I mentioned how my brother spent some time there for getting into bad fights. [He'd only served a year].  &nbsp;  While we were on this subject, Laurie had mentioned that her brother&nbsp;was in jail, and still is. I asked what he was in for, she said murder. I asked how old her brother was, she said 23. As soon as she said it, I knew who he was. Living in a small town, there's not a lot of murders. The age alone told me who it was.&nbsp; 7 years ago, when her brother was 16, he and his best friend were completely out of their mind on drugs when they were taking a cab somewhere. They strangled the cab driver, cut his throat and beat himwith a hammer til he died. They got $40.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Later on, he went to his girlfriend's house, dropped off his school bag with the murder weapon and bloody clothes in it. He'd told his girlfriend [who would later on date my brother for a couple of months] what he'd done, and that he was going to play some pool with friends. He left the schoolbag in her room under her bed. She called the cops after he left, but didn't tell them about the schoolbag because she didn't know that there was anything in it and she didn't really think of it. A couple days later, she remembered the school bag, opened it up, found the evidence and went the cops. She was charged and put on probation for not telling them about it sooner, which is fucking ridiculous.  &nbsp;  Anyway, Laurie was in Grade 5 when her brother did this. She told me that it ruined her family and&nbsp;that her mom went into deep depression. Laurie was diagnosed with manic depression the following year and began self-mutilating and tried to commit suicide for years after that. Her family was spit upon because of what he'd done.&nbsp; She told me that&nbsp;she had trouble making friends ever since then. No one wanted to let their kids hang around with "the murderer's sister." The teachers were mean to her, adults were mean to her, parents and kids alike were mean to her. She told me that her bestfriend's mother wouldn't let her go over to her house after that because she thought Laurie might murder her daughter. She said for the better part of 4 or 5 years she just wanted to die.&nbsp; She's on medication for depression now...7 years later.  &nbsp;  She told me that her brother was always a good kid, and very intelligent. She said he'd got bored and got into drugs and it was&nbsp;his downfall. She said that she's scared to have kids when she's older because she doesn't want them to have the same type of problem because she said that kind of thing runs in her family. I felt so bad when she was telling me this stuff...when something like this happens in a family, nothing is ever the same. Her brother has a 25 - life prison sentence, he is elligable for Parole next year, but she doesn't think he'll get it. He was supposed to be able to come home for her High School graduation next year but they're not going to let him now.  &nbsp;  Manic-depression and suicide is a big thing on my mom's side of the family. I, myself, have been on medications for severe depression, insomnia and social anxiety. For the past few years, I've always cursed that side of the family for it...but it's nothing you can help. I suppose things will happen that are meant to happen.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      It's my day off work and everyone in my house insists on asking why I'm not out tonight.Quite frankly, I don't want to go out. I work so much that it's just nice to sit back and have nothing to do&nbsp;at all.&nbsp;I'm not used to this. I'm back to work tomorrow, 12-8, and I have no chance of getting off work early because Stephen decided to have a car show in the parking lot, yes....the&nbsp; A&W parking lot....he's calling it "Cruising the Dub."   What an idiot. It's going to be retardedly busy though.   I have 48 hours this week. I'm always scheduled for 5 shifts (40 hours), but I always end up getting suckered into picking up an extra shift for someone. I'm a 17 year old girl, I shouldn't be working this much and wasting my summer away but I'm working hard so I can save up my money for a car and random other things. [Dad and I have a deal that if I give him $1,000 he'll pay the rest to buy me a car]. This deal is way too easy, because I only have to pay a grand and he's paying the rest...I think he's getting jipped, I think he would pay for it all but I think he wants me to work towards something.   Anyway, hey...I got a 4 month old purebread&nbsp;Beagle puppy the other day. She is the runt of the litter. She had&nbsp;a hair lip, and she had surgery and they fixed it now. Next month I have to&nbsp;take her in to get spayed, laser surgery on her nose so she can breathe better, and her cleft pallet fixed. She is the most loving, needy little puppy ever. Her name is Cookie.       Anyway, that's all...  &nbsp;

      Work today was horrible. It was far too hot. I didn't speak to Vince all night until the end of my shift. He thought I was mad at him, so he didn't speak to me, and I thought he was mad at me, so I didn't speak to him. I cleared it all up at the end of my shift and everything's cool now  Everytime I get stressed out I get really bad pains in my stomach like my stomach is eating itself. It lasts for about 45 minutes to an hour and then it usually goes away. Today at work it was really busy and I was working with all new people, I was getting really frustrated and I started the pains. I went on my break and I couldn't eat so I just sat there with my head down for 15 minutes. Lynn suggested that it might just be dehydration, so I drank a few bottles of water and it didn't help. I took some pills, it didn't help. The muggy weather is really bothering my knees as well, I already have bad cartlage in my knees and during certain weather-types I experiance more pain than usual in them.  I really am a hurting unit.  Work again tomorrow, 11:30-8. Ashley is working until 8 too, so after work we are heading down to the North End to see Xiu Xiu. It should be a good show.

      I'm having a bad night, and I just completely told off Vince. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings but I think I might have...I didn't say anything mean, I just told him some things I've wanted to say to him for a while. Every girl in Pictou County wants this guy and he's always accidentally leading girls on and complaining to me how he feels bad for hurting peoples feelings, he's such a sweet guy, and I usually listen to him. He always puts everyone else first and himself second and gives himself no credit when girls mess with his head and try to put the guilt trip on him when he doesn't want them. But tonight he was complaining about being torn between two girls and I told him to "grow the fuck up and start taking people's feelings into consideration because what you're doing is a tad bit grade 9, don't you think?" or something, and then I continued on into a big speal on him basically ripping him apart.  Some new guy at work flipped on me tonight for no reason and said that I'm snotty and stuck up and think I'm better than everyone else and that I take jokes "too far." It's strange how that works seeing how I get along with everyone there, and I'm always really nice to the guy...it's not my fault that everyone there likes me and knows how to take my jokes and he just gets his panties in a twist.  So I told him to eat a dick and shut his fucking mouth...
