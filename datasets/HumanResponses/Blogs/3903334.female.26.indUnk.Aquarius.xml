      lately, am not feeling what i used to feel before.. am i losing it? i think i am.. he's so different now! well, i guess, am the reason he behaved tht way.. he keep on putting this guilt on me for not being there.. yes, it is my fault.. i know i know.. whatever! &nbsp; i felt tht he is losing interest in me! well, am not blaming him coz i'm dull, boring and insane! i guess, i shud not really bother abt this right! i shud let some of my loves for him go away.. coz it will be too much for me to handle if something bad happen later.. &nbsp; i do love him so damn much.. but i guess, love is not the answer! my bad.. &nbsp; from today onwards,&nbsp;i will try not to think abt him tht much i know it will be difficult but i shud atleast try and do it! i really want us to be ok but i cant really see the route heading to tht direction.. i dunno know.. &nbsp; all i know tht, i love him.. i care for him... i need him.. &nbsp; maybe tht aint good enough..   am a depressed bunny today!

      life is indeed like a rollercoaster!  and i love riding it..  &nbsp;  anyways, my dude was extremely awesome today!  i love him so much!  i really do, despite all those ups and downs..  well, those are the things that spices up our life, right?  &nbsp;  am not sure why am writing all this stuff here..  and am sure no one is bother to read abt this crappy life of mine..  but i guess, it is one of the way for me to let it out..  coz&nbsp;am not so good in telling it to someone else..  not even my bf..  and he doesnt know abt this blog..  so, i can say what ever i want here..  &nbsp;  today, i juz feel like&nbsp;writing abt him..  frankly speaking,  i am blessed to have such a sexy,&nbsp;gorgeous, kind, loving, romantic and honest HOMBRE!  he is one of a kind..  basically, he is someone you could regularly meet at a trendy and cool clubs..  he has the killer look with a jaw dropping figure..  he do flirts a LOT! hehe..  every girls and some guys (!!) wanna be with him..  well, too late for tht missy..he's mine!  when i first got to know him..  i tot that he is a typical spoiled brat kiddo..  i tot tht he is a player and not a suitable bf material..  but  I WAS SO DEAD WRONG!   phewww...  he is  NOTHING  like tht!  as i got to him a lil more closer..  i begin to adore him and he amazed me by showing his true colors!  he never failed to suprise me..  and one thing leads to another..  and here i am now, head over heels&nbsp;on him..  &nbsp;  being with him is really like riding a rollercoaster..  well, to be more precise, it is juz like the Lethal Weapon ride (my fave ride!)  it is so scary, intense, exciting, crazy, insane, awesome, exhilarating, groovy, sexy, action-packed etc etc etc!  to sum it up it's like a combo of all the feelings..  and it's tremendously  ASTOUNDING! AMAZING!   &nbsp;  well, i miss him so freaking much now..  u see, am in New Zealand and he is in Malaysia..  so this is the biggest 'thumbs down' part in our relationship..  i would be so depressed whenever i know tht he is down or feeling blue,  and am not there to comfort him..  i really hate it!  he's lonely and the only thing i could do to him now is to&nbsp;call him  and make him feel tht he is not alone..  but sometimes, that is not good enough..  we've been talking like atleast 3 times a day!  and it can go up to 2 hours of passionate (!!) conversation  hehehe..  but tht aint good enough!  :(  &nbsp;  well, he is everything to me now..  and i wanna be there for him..  am planning to visit him soon..  hope everything will turn out ok..  *finger crossed*  &nbsp;  to my sexy hombre!  te amo mucho mucho, mi amor!  you're the best thing that ever happened to me!  you've given me the new meaning in life..  you treated me like am a princess..  you showered me with your loves..  and yes baby, i do want an ending with you!  i really do...  &nbsp;  and yes peeps,   am a blessed and happy bunny today!    &nbsp;  - krysha -  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'm feeling down right now!  I decided to cut short my trip just so i can be with him  coz i dun wanna leave him alone  he had enuff loneliness..  and me being away will make it worst..   but i guess, it was not worth it..  i tot he will be delighted to know tht am home..  well, he did actually but not as delighted as i am..   honestly, he did lotsa things tht really hurt me!  but i never had the guts to let him know abt it  coz i dun want him to be depressed and downed..  besides, he might think tht am being selfish or fussy..  and i know he didnt do all tht purposely..  again, i'll end up keeping it to myself..  he is too important to me..  and i love him too damn much to hurt him..  i rather be hurt than seeing him get hurt!   maybe i put too high expectations on him..  or maybe i am not that important to him..  well, maybe the situation that we are in with make it even worst..  am a bad gf!  i am..  coz i know i shudn't been having this kind of tots abt him..  i shudn't doubt him..  i shudn't question his love to me..  but what a girl suppose to do..   is it too much to ask your bf to be with u?  is it too much to ask your bf to share with u?  is it too much to worry abt your bf?  is it too much to expect your bf to call u and wish u goodnite?   i really wish i know what to do...  am so lost and confused!  all i know is i am truly madly in love with him..  and he said the same thing too..  but the question is,  how truly madly deeply is he over me?    am a frustrated bunny today!    :((

      i love my dude so much! :)  yup,   am a happy bunny today!    i had to go thru a whole load of *&amp;)+)(@^@)!+*&amp;#_! (!!)  before spending such a lovely time with him..  he was a bit cold at first!  he called earlier but he sounded different!  i was so scared but i acted cool,  coz i dun wanna pressure him or something.   as usually, he will go thru his daily routine..  and again, i'll be waiting for him to complete all of his activities,  before he could call me and talk to me..  being away from him does make the situation worst!  i had to sleep early in order to be awaken by the time he calls me!  i had to sacrifies my nights, my sleep for him..  which i dun mind at all..  coz this is the least that we could do to make each other happy..  well,i love him so very much..  so it is worth all the waiting..   but last night, things were a bit different..  usually, he'll be back around 11ish which is 3am for me here!  and he will call me an hour or so after that!  but yesterday, after his workout,  he went to his friend's party!  well, this is the part that i fierce the most!  is not like i dun trust him  but am afraid he'll get drunk,  and start doing something he soon will regret..  or things that will make me mad..  but at the same time,  i dun wanna him to be left out!  i dun wanna hold him back from his friend..  from having fun..from chilling out!  and am aware of his popularity among his female friends..  and i know tht he loves to flirt around  and he knows that i dun really mind,  as long as he knows his limit!   he texted me to tell me abt it..  i told him to be good and stay away from trouble..  and i told him that am going away tomorrow for 2 days..  and he was kinda frustrated coz i didnt tell him abt it earlier..  well, it was kinda last minute thingy..  and i wanted to tell him tonight..  after the frustration text message,  he did not call or text me no more!  and i was worried..  i tried to get some sleep..  but i failed..  i was so worried abt him..  i called him couple of times..  and he did not answered..  this is the part tht i really really hate the most..  i hate to wait for him not knowing where is he?  and he knew abt it but well he did it again..  keep me waiting, worrying and crying abt him..   well, as i expected..  he came back late and he was drunk!  yup he was so drunk but he wouldnt want to admit it..  i dun mind actually..  coz atleast i know now tht he is safe at home..  he talked funny..  but he was kinda aware of the situation...  and he appologized and told me tht he's sorry..  well, i guess, tht is more than enuff for me..  he told me abt his day and i told him abt mine..  we told each other how we love each other..  and he was so freaking cute and sexy...  and he's so damn wild! :P   guess, what they said is true..  love conquers it all..  am so in love with my man..  and am so lucky to have him..  and he asked me, if he has nothing in life,  would i still love him..  well, baby, in whatever situation u r,  my love for you will be unchanged!  te amo mucho mucho mi amor..  my sexy gorgeous hombre!  mwaahhhhssss

      this relationship of mine has been thru lotsa ups and downs.. am not sure whether am in it anymore! well, only God knows how crushed and hurt am right now..  anyway, the past few weeks were a bit dull.. didnt do nothing much.. been in and out the hospital like almost everyday now.. i even been warded for few days last week.. but my condition is still the same.. no progress! i guess, this time around, my time will eventually come.. but am not going to give up.. coz i've promise someone tht i love so dearly something.. by hook or by crook, am gonna have to go thru this alone.. am not forcing anyone to be there with me.. coz it is a very bumpy ride.. currently my life is so empty.. am heartless.. someone is holding back my heart.. and i would like it to remain tht way.. eventho i didnt get anything in return.. i dont mind.. i strongly believe that my purpose here in this dying world of ours, is to please and make everyone else happy.. and i kinda like it coz it gives me a great satisfaction if i manage to do so.. but now   am not a satisfied   bunny    !   coz i think someone is very mad at me.. and honestly, i have no idea what i've done to him.. he did something kinda hurtful to me last friday.. and i was deeply hurt but i guess tht doesnt matter right.. coz am no one and no one cares abt this silly girl's feeling.. life is juz wonderful aite? i might not be able to blog as often as i did before.. i'll be going somewhere quite far soon.. till then take care dear bloggie!
