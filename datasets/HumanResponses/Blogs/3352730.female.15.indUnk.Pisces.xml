      Ok im back. I don't know what happened yesterday or why I have 2 posts from thats day. I guess i got click happy for a second. Oh well. Its over. ok today I wanna talk about new things. My friend Jose is one of my best friends and we've never met. My friend shannon M. (I have many friends named shannon.)met him and introduced us. I trust her so i'm not worried, we have been friends since kindergarden after all.  People think i'm stupid 'cause I don't talk much ,but i'm smart and i'm not just bragging. I talk alot when you get me talking about something I actually care about. Like when my friends say the love a guy I can talk for hours then.I know this may bore people so when the quotations stop i'm done.This is good advice though or I think so.   "You love him? How is that you don't even know what love is. Love is a  mutual feeling in whitch two people care about each other so much they would die for each other. It is when the other touches you you feel as if nothing will ever come between you. It is when the other kisses you you know that they will never kiss another.It is when you are in love. You can not fall out of love. You cannot fall in love. You are always in love with the one you are supposed to love . It is destany.It is desited by fate when you are born. Some people never find their love because they waste their time with people they don't love. Even when the know they don't love them for fear of never finding their love. In the end their fear was missused and they expeirances their fear first hand and don't even relize it.Or so I feel/ believe." Ok im done! Long huh!? See i'm not stupid! :) New subject! I like two guys *^$@#) and !%&(@. HA ha thought I was gonna tell ya huh?! yeah right . If you know do not post it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The thing is their both in one of my classes. OMG! I think one of them likes me but i'm not sure about the other. Why are guys so complicated?! Well I do believe I have posted enough for today.See ya!!!

      This is my first weblog. I really don't know what to write. I just got this so I could complain to myself and you people I guess. Ok lets givethis a try.   I am so mad i want to swim but can't because my little sis is in the pool. I CAN'T STAND HER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't like to swim with people 'cause they annoy me.   Lets change the subject before I get to mad. Ok . So I am aslo mad 'cause my school fired my fav. teacher. She dose everything for that school. she miss Pitzl and shes the greatest teacher. This is my first year in my high school and I only had her once but she is so cool. The one who fired her is Mr. Ward the principal. He's a jerk and EVERYONE hates him. He thinks we students think highly of him but we don't. He should  hear the things we say about him. My school is Ridgeland. I got tired of writing high school. I know not many people will read this but those who do i'll tell ya'll 'bout myself later. Well I wrote more then i thought I would! I like this weblog thing! I think i'll keep it! Well i'm out! See ya!
