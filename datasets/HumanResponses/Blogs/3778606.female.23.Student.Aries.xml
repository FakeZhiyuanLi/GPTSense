      bubba-hotep is the bubba-ho shit. elvis and mummies and bruce campbell, oh my. what more could a little girl ask for? i just found out yesterday, which is probably old news to everyone else,  that bruce campbell was also in Spiderman. he was the wrestling announcer that gave "the human spider" his name. supposedly he is in the sequel too. there was talk that he was made to sign a disclosure agreement not to divulge any information to the media about the sequel. He then offered it to the highest paying fan, stating that any money he made from the secret would earn him more money than what he was actually paid to be in the money. Nice. another day, another 8 dollars an hour at sprint pcs. God bless commission checks.

      okay, one of the worst nights at the sprint store ever! i thought we closed at eight, but apparently not. customers didnt get out of the store until 820,and that's with me turning away sales, denying upgrades and basically telling people to fuck off. people getting shitty with me cos customer service told them to come in here and that we would basically wipe thier ass for them AND give them a new phone free. customer service forgot to meantion that in addition to the free phone, the customers can also suck my ass! free of charge, no activation fee on sucking. bastards. now we are $15 over so, at least we made money on the suckas. i'm gonna go eat my cold ass wendy's chili to celebrate.

      i dont care how lame this is, i think i just posted a funny comment on ryry's blog, if you two people who read this blog have a problem with it, oh well. cos then i have only seemed desperate for humor to two people who know me well enough to expect it from me. i think its a gem. especially the last line of the first paragraph. beautiful.  **this has got to be the saddest site i have ever seen. it is the undead, that is actually deader than dead. it will not die. i dont know what i am talking about. i just wanted to tear this site's "comment hymen". yuck. i had to get you back for that "virgin ass blog" comment. so there. Hah-muthafuckin-hah, bitch.  i just made that up and it is too funny. i think i want to copy and paste this to my site so that others can enjoy it. wait, you are the only one who reads it, and you already saw it. never mind. tell others about my brilliance. word of mouth , yo.   later  dont foget to family please me.  mooooooly**  that last comment is in reference to ryan and i going to monical's this weekend so i can tell him adios before he peaces out the americas for some japa-sleaze. now that i have pirated my own posts, i think i will go to lunch.   peace-za

      so i had that free xanga trial subscription for the premium package, but it sucked a d, so i am back to freeloading off this muddafuggin site. last night it was straight up wild kingdom at 513 Deville. i locked gracie and chica in the kitchen together so that the kitty would be near the litter box. well, chica rolled up to her spot under the kitchen table to find gracie chillin in her bed and lickin herself. she flipped out and attcked the kitty. justin and i came running to the kitchen to find the kit with her claws beared and chica doing some kind of barking circle ritual, basically herding the kitty like a sheep. she didnt bite her at least cos the kitty got claws that could tear that bitches eyes out. chicadoo's bark was ferocious like a fucking rott or something. she's a sassypants like her mama. yip, yip. i'll be damned if i roll up and find another pussy in my bed. sheh-it.   my coworker is playing some ring tones for me on his phone. he has nintendo ones such as mega man in midi. tite.   last night that the psycho formerly known as Mike-the-Filipino called me last night about three times with a blocked number. i finally answered after getting tired of listening to that broke ass disco swan lake bullshit, thanks ryan. he was all apologetic and trying to get a second chance by bribing me such thangs as flowers and monicals gift certificates. now that's just fuckin playin with a girl's emotions. ya'll dont fuck with me and my monicals. i was both aroused and turned off by his such blatant attempt to dangle monicals in my face for a second go round with his crazyass. i said "nigga pleez" and told him to keep his damn monicals (and then justin about scratched my eyes out) and i dont want no stinkin flowers. bastard will probably send em anyway. guess i'll just HAVE to eat the delicious monicals goodness, and then continue to not answer his phone calls in effort to get a fuckin family pleaser. harf!  wud effah, man.  time to trabajo. that means work, cracka ass cracka!  momo

      i wish more people would read this so i could feel like my efforts are warranted. but i guess i would first need to make an effort, right? there is a major tornado busting through bloomington normal right now.  we are doing training and we actually got done early, then we see the sky turn black and a funnel cloud touch down. yay. i hope my dog is okay. i acquired a new kitten yesterday, and now i hope that she, chica and foxxy are straight. plus i think that the windows are open at the old trailer. double yay.  so about the kitty. i bribed my niece with a new BRATZ doll that cost six dollars in exchange for a kitty that she was earlier crying about at the thought of even giving it to me. after i threatened that the cat would inevitably be ran over, eaten by a goat, or die from disease (my niece lives on a farm),  and then asked "how much is she worth to you" i was presented with a deal to buy a doll for her, let her visit the cat at my place, and to name it Gracie. Viola, i now have a new kitty. she is gray and fluffy as hael. however, this morning i couldnt find her so i think chica may have already offed her in an attempt to claim her spot back as the "cute pet."  another note, me and the filipino are no longer. he flipped out and almost got into three fights last friday, which would nomally not be a big deal, except he tried to blame the fights on me, get his friends to fight them for him, and then yelled at me in front of everyone at la bamba for being a "free food whore" and eating nachos with his friends. he has major insecurity issues that i do not want to deal with right now. i personally do not think that he is worth it. plus he has this tendency to wig out, apologize all lovey dovey and then yell at me all over again. i first i thought it was funny, then i thought that he has major issues. he is one of those people that attack your character whenever they feel cornered and say some really bogus, uncalled for things and then pull a "babe, come here. i'm just kidding." and then i am like "...." and then he answers with "fuck you then. fuck it, i'm done. go date my friend so he can buy you nachos. your shit aint that great anyway." as if he knows anything about my "shit" cos if he did, he wouldnt be able to walk right now. haha, syke.   but seriously. i coulda busted out some "your penis looks like a funsize snickers" but i took the high road and just ended it instead of being infantile and bitter. he is still calling me but blocking his number. i told him friday night i was done, then he called sat and left an apologetic message, followed by the "your shit aint that great" message when i didnt call him back, then i actually answered a call just to tell him to stop calling and he tried to get back with me again. since then he has called me from multiple numbers and even with a "private number" setting. the dumbfuck called me right after he called from his number though, so it wasnt exactly fuckin hard to figure out it was him. the scarry thing is that he knows where i live, work and what kind of car i drive. yikes. i can take him though, he's like five nine and 145, if even. i got this.  well, time to die in a tornado.  piece-  mo

      i dont even know what the point is of having this blog. i just read other blogs of people i dont even know. it helps pass the time here at the sprint store. plus, when i am staring at my compu screen, customers think i am busy and leave me the fawk alone.   i have been spending hella time with my new "boy toy" lately. i met him friday at a bar, how tacky is that? he didnt try to spit any game or come off pimpin, so i gave it a shot. we actually talked for an hour or so, which is pretty unheard of in a bar scene. he has lots of pluses: cute, half-filipino, smart, can dance, buys drinks for everyone like its their birthday. he does smoke though, so thats alittle unappealing, plus he just turned 21 in feb. which means he is in his bar year. anyway, we hung out alot. all my freinds like him and vice versa. now comes the question of whether i want to persue this or not.   for the past month there has been light talk of my sister moving to watseka, or however you spell it. i am not sure how far it is from here, maybe 45 mins. i know that it is about 35 min from hoopeston. well, they put their house on the market monday and have talked to a builder about building a house for them. her last day at work is today. i figured i had at least two weeks left to spend with her. she called me last night and told me that she is moving next week. her husband starts work at his father's dealership on weds, so they are basically moving over the weekend. i almost cried when she told me, and she said she had tears in her eyes and i could hear her voice cracking. yikes. i was at a baseball game with the aforementioned youngun, so i told her i would call her back before i started cryin in front of everyone. i know my sister and i have had our differences, but she was the one i moved to bloomington with 5 years ago. we see each other often cos we take our dogs for walks together and go out for dinner and drinks. i will be the sole martinez left here in bloomington. its a little scary just cos my family is so close. i have justin though, and rachel and i are talking about being roommates, and she is like a sister too me also. it's gonna be sad, but i wish her the best. before i get weepy at work, i'm gonna go play some solitaire. actually, just the name of the game is a little too close to home right now. maybe i'll just look at porn. syke.

      this is the blog thati was referencing in the post from saturday. after it double posted, it double erased. so here it is again. good thing i am running 2 equally crappy blogs, so i just stole the post from the other one. yay.  it's eight thirty in the morning and i am slightly hung over. more tired than anything. got about four hours of sleep, which was cut even shorter by one of those lovely random ex-significant other phone calls at five in the morning. when i brought this to his attention he was quick to correct me and say "it's not five, it's 4:56." oh thanks, i feel better knowing that. now i can enjoy my two more hours of sleep before i go to work, but oh no wait, after the call i couldnt sleep cos the sun was up so there goes one of my precious hours. sometimes guys (or all ex-signifs) have the wierdest timing. we dont (sam and i) talk for 2 weeks, then i met another guy last night...and sam calls. bogus. so this new guy seems alright. his likeness to others i know is a little much though. he is half filipino(on his mom's side), from a small town, plays the drums and supposedly turntables...sound familiar? i was a little drunk, or a lot, when i met him so i am not making any judgements. or maybe i made up all those things about him cos i stereotyped all pacific islanders the same. either way, i'll let him spit a little game my way and see if he is worth the time and energy it takes to date someone. plus he just turned 21 in feb, so i am a little weary that he is just entering his bar years. which in bloomington-normal, are not all that fun or interresting. i, on the other hand am almost out of mine. i think once  you hit 24, unless you live somewhere cool or have a friend that works at a bar, it is best to duck out gracefully from the bar scene. i mean, you can be sex in the city, but you gotta be in a city or else it just looks seedy. that is what i say now, but ask me in four years when i am still picking up barely legals.
