      Welcome to my blog (I hate that word, it's so ugly!). I'm the journaling type, so I'll be keeping this up pretty frequently, even if nobody reads it. :D  This will be the 'personal', often updated part of my webpage (www.scarlettvancouver.com), which is also a work of vanity that I still don't know why I'm doing...except that it seems fun, and I bought a web design package at an auction (Exotic Embrace for PACE- the designer of my page is www.freespiritmedia.com, she's excellent!).   I didn't realize until I was assigned duties to help get the webpage up and running how computer-illiterate I am! And here I thought I was the shit. As such, it will probably be a couple of weeks more until the site is fully operational and running smoothly (ie until I find some content, and learn enough about web publishing to maintain it myself), but feel free to check in and watch the progress, and/or email me with suggestions and comments. I'm totally into feedback, even if you're a stranger-- I think i'll start to feel a bit demented on here if I'm always typing and nobody's responding!  I'm leaving tomorrow to work for the week at the Red Lion in Victoria, BC. Looking forward to sunshine, the swimming pool in the hotel and that awesome awesome stage!

      I was sitting around happily watching Fear Factor and working on a new costume tonight (a white bunny romper with a bowtie, collar, and playboy appliques), when I got a call to go in and replace someone at the Penthouse...I'm a sucker, can't turn down work, so I packed up and rushed out. It was a fine night, dead dead dead, but I got to talk to lovely Vienna, who I haven't seen in forever, so it was worth it...it's x amount of money I&nbsp;wouldn't have made watching TV and sewing anyways; I'm happy&nbsp;:).   The problem is, the activity of it all has put me into an insomniac state- I'm really awful with sleeping anyways, but interruptions to my regular or expected schedule are the worst..I'll be lucky if I get 3 hours before I have to get up to leave for Whistler tomorrow :(. Ah well, I'll sleep on the bus :D.  Whistler will be nice...it &nbsp;sounds like the easiest schedule (8-12 ish every night), plus I'll get some good stuff in like a bit of hiking, some plant identifying (berry picking, hopefully!), and meeting hostel folk-- I have such a fondness for hostel folk, likely due to my status as&nbsp;one for so many years. Plus, hostel people are cool because they are usually people in transition, and people in transition have the best ideas about life and how to live it. AND I arranged for a photographer to take some pics of me up there (why the hell not, I have 4 full days to fill!), and if I'm lucky I might get to go bungy jumping! I've been once before, in Taupo, NZ, and it was so scary- scarier than a lot of things I've done, like skydiving and waterfall rafting. I don't know why, it must be primal, with the ground rushing up at you so quickly there's nothing to think but "ohmygodi'mgoingtodie!". But in a good way ;).  How irritating, I hate reading over what I've written. But I'll leave it anyways- I'm hoping and assuming that most people will get too bored to read most of these entries :D.

      Getting a website together is a tremendous amount of work, and I'm barely doing any of it at this point! Blech, I spent all day getting this devil of a thing together yesterday, only to find out that my free hosting on Shaw was not going to work out (not enough space for all my nudie pics :p), so now I'm paying for hosting, but have a lot more room and can accomodate a lot more people (so I hope there are people to accomodate!).  I want to release this baby soon, because I'm excited to see if people like it, hear feedback from customers and dancers etc...but also nervous, because like anytime that you put yourself out there publicly, there's going to be a subset of people that just hate you and everything you have to say. At work, it's no problem, I ignore (thank god it's usually too loud to hear any comments from the stage!), plus I can get offenders kicked out anyways :D. But here...well, I'm aware that it's such a conceited thing to even have a website, especially with no profit motive ("I just love myself so much, and assume everyone else does too, that I've devoted a whole site to ME!"). But, dancing is such a superficial and conceited thing in itself (not in a bad way!), I guess I have to roll with that. But hey, keep your hatin' comments to yourselves, please, I'm sensitive and will get upset.  The weather is SO NICE, and I've been unable to keep myself out of the sun...luckily no burn yet. A very lovely Kitty came over yesterday and rubbed my feet with reflexology, and&nbsp;with that and the sun, I now&nbsp;feel  awesome . Thank you Kitty!  I finished 100 years of solitude- a sad but satisfying ending- closure if I ever met it. I don't know about it being "The best book ever!", but it was good..I'll need to read it again to really 'get' it. But not now, now I'm on the the trash (I'm alternating): I have a dirty dirty book by Judy Blume called 'Wifey'. Now, Judy Blume is the heroine author of 12 year old girls, her stuff is slightly racy for 12 year olds, but honest and really quite wholesome. Kind of teaches a bit about the facts of life and stuff- she's still one of my favs, a very good YA author. This book, though, is subtitled 'An adult novel', and lord is it ever. I can't even imagine the controversy that must have exploded when a YA author published an erotic novel...actually, it was published in 1978, maybe it's pre- the teen books? In any case, bold career move. The opening scene is a guy driving up on a motorcycle, masturbating on a woman's lawn, and then driving off. The bored housewife looking from the upstairs window is shocked but titillated. It goes on from there. The word cunt is used a lot. Quality reading ;).

      My oh my, the past week just flew by. Which is a good thing, actually. Weeks like this make me realize I really do enjoy my job, and most especially the people I've met through work. Fun lineup, fun staff, good crowd...if it weren't for the sweltering heat! (and the ridiculous distance Maple Ridge has decided to place itself from civilization...lol).&nbsp;It was OK outside, but the air-con must have been broken at the Haney because we, the staff, and the customers all had a perpetual cooked ham look to us from the lazing around all pink and sweaty in the heat.  This week I'm off! Very exciting, it's been awile now. I'm going to see Fahrenheit 9/11&nbsp;tomorrow,&nbsp;hopefully followed by a not-too-violent debate with my fellow movie-goers ;). The rest of the week will be relegated to putting the finishing touches on my apartment renovations (to those who have heard be bitch and moan about them for months,&nbsp;yes, really, this is it!), entertaining  la familia , working on my site (which should be up and ready if you're reading this) and doing some of that good ol' summer stuff like hiking and swimming&nbsp;&nbsp;in lakes. Lynn Headwaters and Alouette Lake are definitely on the list.

      I'm reading '100 years of solitude'. It's driving me insane, because of it's non-relation to reality...it's all 'gulliver's travels' in the fact that it seems to be placed in a fake world where things happen that just aren't possible, but they still relate to our 'real lives'...and not in an overly-fantastic way; it's just close enough to reality to make you feel crazy. I'm only about 60 or so pages in- insomnia as a contagious disease is what they're talking about at the moment, and I think they're on the verge of revealing the main characters' immortality or something like that. Not what I was expecting when I picked it up. There's also a guy with a giant wang. :D Screw you Oprah! ha ha, not really, but her recommendation is the reason I picked it up- honestly, though I'm an English major and all into books n' stuff, I'd never even heard of it before. Go figure. But when a book gets a review like 'should be required reading for the entire human race' and 'the best story since the book of Genesis', well, what are you gonna do but read it?  I'm working at Kruisers this week, it's fine, I can't complain. I'm actually quite liking it so far, I hope they are able to stay open with the same schedule for some time to come, as it works well for me. I'm surprised by the non-hickness of PoCo too- my ignorance had me assuming it was all pig farms out that way, but the crowd is nice, the area is not bad and there's some sweet housing around there.

      For those who have asked, Wifey ended up sucking. It was a bad book, not even entertaining bad. Not very impressed with the Judy Blume in this case...but Blubber is still one of my faves :).  Now I'm on to Tess of the D'Urbervilles...it's slow-going, but promises to be very rewarding, as Thomas Hardy generally is :D.  The L word was fun! I was playing a stripper at a bachelorette party for a lesbian couple, and I was dressed up as a man! A sexy lady-man though, with full makeup and a moustache drawn on, a top hat, cuffs, collar, vest and thong panties. No pants! The other two girls were dressed as brides- my bitches, if you will. We were actually working for a total of 3-4 hours approx, but on set for 26! Paid, I wasn't complaining! We got a trailer that we shared with the drag queens, our own makeup and hair people, and lots of yummy food. It was fun, but I wouldn't want to do it for a living. You have to stay in the vicinity of the trailer the whole time, no naps allowed (!)-- all there is to do is watch movies, play games, talk, smoke, eat, read...very long and unproductive days.  OK, so I smoke and I don't like that. If worst comes to worse I think I will be able to quit successfully when I go to New Zealand- 6 weeks outside of my regular routine, I'm feeling confident that that will be what I need (well, that plus willpower etc, but that's a given). Until then, I'm doing a few things to reduce the damage- for one, I've always taken lots of supplements- Ester-C and CoQ-10 especially are excellent for helping smokers repair the damage. Second, I'm not smoking too much- only at work or out with friends (ie not at home), 5 a day is my max. goal. I would like to add a third thing though- healthier tobacco. Haha, I know, but every little bit helps! I looked it up online and apparently you can get something called 'chop chop', chemical-free tobacco. I'm going to try to find some. (and if it exists, why haven't I ever heard of it and why doesn't anyone/everyone use it???)

      I went to Ambleside beach yesterday and whilst walking around the rocks near the pier, I practically fell over a baby seal on the sand! I freaked out and started yelling at everyone nearby to come over and help me-- I'm seal-ignorant, I thought it had beached itself! It was moving about so gimpily that I thought it must not be able to function on land, but a nice lady nearby explained to me that it was a baby, which is why it couldn't move well, and that it was just trying to sun itself. I watched it for a long while- it was so sweet, it looked like a little water-puppy! It kept dragging iself around and changing poses- my favorite was when it was lounging on it's side, like a woman sitting on a chaise longue in her boudoir, with it's flipper up under it's head. Cute! A dumb fat woman came by and started poking at it with a stick, so I told her that seals are like pitbulls, and that it would bite her if provoked (I have no idea, I just made that up). The seal backed me up by hissing at her. She left.  I graduated (unofficially) the other day- it feel weird, not great, actually...I understand why people go into a post-grad funk! NowI feel like I have no excuses, I ought to do something noble and excellent...but what? With an English degree? I'm looking forward to going back to school for something extremely specialized that I can really devote myslef to- the choices right now are between accounting, financial planning, private investigating (I know, I know..), and bioengineering. I also think I should consider something outdoorsy-like, since I'm all into that and am really happiest outdoors, but money is an issue. Any job that involves frolicking outdoors is unlikely to pay much (if I'm wrong, please enlighten me!).  In the morning I'm going to do the L-word- I'm very excited, mostly about the free food and having an air-conditioned trailer to hang out in ;). I'm a bit apprehensive about the actual filming- I'm not terribly experienced at the TV/acting thing- actually, I'm completely inexperienced. But I'm sure it will be fine.  I have to wake up early in the morning to buy new shoes, too- I broke one of my heels on stage tonight! It's ridiculous how quickly I go through dancing shoes!

      I have an exam in the morning...don't ask why I'm up. I dunno.  The stats for my page are funny- lots of hits, and I don't know how they're finding me! I mean, I've given out the url to, like, 15 people maybe, and I've had 168 unique visitors (2000 some odd non-unique, most probably me checking to see what's working or not :D). Weird.  I have to admit, most of the feedback I've gotten on the site hasn't been very positive. Lots of *shrug* "what's the point?", and "I expected better pictures in the gallery".  . Well, for one, it's not FINISHED yet, and the point? It's been established, there isn't one. If you don't like it you don't have to look. You dig? Sheesh.  There's a private investigation course at Douglas College this fall, I'm considering applying. I've always thought I'd be good at that. Could be fun, I'd want to do low-key stuff like skip-tracing, no bounty hunting or anything.

      My big news for today is that I'm going to be an extra on a TV show called the L-word. This was arranged though Stripper (the agency), and I'm happy because it pays quite well. I'm playing the role of 'lapdancer' (of course!). So I guess I'll have to learn how to lapdance now! I will be there on Tuesday and Wenesday next week, which is cool as it adds a little bit of 'different' into the same old same old...  I'm just about gradumatated, two more exams to go...I truly know the meaning of the word bittersweet now! lol, mostly just kidding...though I  will  make sure to look at the job options that are actually available when I get my next degree. (*eye roll*)  Mugs this week...well...it's Mugs. I will not be unhappy when Saturday evening rolls around. I kicked someone! First time, though I'm surprised I haven't done it before...I don't understand the logic of bars placing their poles so close to the edge- I guess so that guys get a 'better look', but that's dumb in many respects. Bums and crotches are ugly close up. It's unhygenic, since so many guys feel the need to eat in gyno row, to have naked pussy near food, and finally it's unsafe- YOU MIGHT GET KICKED! This guy I kicked in the nose with the toe of my shoe going around the pole..he bled a bit, but was very nice and joked about it, totally let me off the hook, Phew. It was a silly accident, I'm usually extremely careful, maybe he moved or maybe my judgement was just off...either way, I'm being even more careful now. Stupid long legs- they're all well and good until somebody loses an eye! ;)
