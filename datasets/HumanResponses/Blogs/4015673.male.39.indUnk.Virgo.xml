						   Feeling like shit , this morning. Had to miss work yesterday thanks to what that West Virginian Dickhead, who is the sniveling , groveling servant of Big Bad S.N., Mr. chain store tycoon (who thinks he is Trump). I am not going in today either. Fucking little lackey of S.N. had to remanifest my bi- polar in a big way again. Shit this is as bad as when I was a prisoner of the phone at CitiBank. Thank God for my Manager who is supporting my situation all the way. Hopefully I will feel better as the day goes on. Shit, Fuck, piss, man, I hate waking up pissed at the world and the idiots that live in it. I will write more later when I am not so agitated.........Man Fuck the World and all of those idiotic rich motherfuckers who think they can dehumanize me . These shithead ignorant motherfuckers who think their money insulates them from any responsibility of their actions. Tramp all over the little guy too often and it will come back to bite you in the ass. Remember that Mr N. , words are powerful and activism is even more powerful when you own businesses. Remember if there are no customers for your stores , your empire dwindles a little each day. Soon there will be no fortune to insulate you. Mabye then you will realize the error of your ways.........I doubt it though, once an idiot always an idiot.......

						   Chapter 1: Out for a run  It started as a late afternoon run on Halloween. Sebastian was running in the mountains a joy which he did everyday. He was going up the northeast trail today. He had not been on that trail for a long time. The northeast trail was not easy as the others he travelled. This trail was a much denser forest area. This was the area you ran in when solitude was sought. It was a cool day around sixty degrees or so. It seemed colder there in the mountains. As Seb reached the top of the trail it seemed to flatten out. It was a sort of high plain. The trail led then left and back up into the dense fir populated forest. As seb was running in the forest he noticed that it was colder here. He thought nothing of it because only a few rays of sunlight peeked through the high canopy of the pines. while running along at a good clip, something in his periphial vision caught his attention. Seb stopped and walked over to a shiny object laying on the ground. It was about four inches circular. The object seemed to be an amulet of some sort. Being curious in nature he squatted down and picked up the amulet. It seemed very heavy in weight . It was a silver medallion, with an inverted Pentagram and an image of Baphomet in the center. From watching countless horror movies he knew what this was. Seb had also done his research on the subject via the internet. He had found that this was a symbol of many Occult blood cults. This amulet had the traditional sabbatical goat on it. But what was it doing out here obviously placed so that what little sunlight available would shine on it at a certain time of day ? On this particular day. Halloween, One of the most important feast days to occultists. As he looked up, he saw there was a faint trail leading deeper into the dark woods. It looked as if the trail was recent. It had not been traveled extensively, it was a freshly broken trail. He needed to see what was going on , he had to investigate this further.  Chapter 2: The Entrance  As Sebastian jogged up the trail, slower than before,surveying the area closer for clues as to what was going on. The trail seemed to travel many intersections. If he was not an ex Army Ranger he would have had a tough time following the confusing trail. But this and the fact that he was a seasoned trail racer led him to follow the trail expertly. As he was running along he thought of what could be going on up here in the serene mountains, he had loved since he was a teenager. It was probably a bunch of goth kids pretending to be a cult. He saw them at the mall wearing all black, and lots of white face paint and dark mascara. Pretending that they were dark and tread on the evil path. They were probably going to have a big Halloween party far from others prying eyes. They were probably going to have a mock sacrafice and get drunk and high. Harmless fun right? As the trail continued on it's left path, it sloped downward. The forest was very dense here, Seb was definately getting close to the perfect spot if what they desired was privacy. Then up ahead he saw what looked like a shadow on a rock face. Seb slowed and walked over to the sheer rock wall. There was a big boulder placed in front of the wall. Through closer inspection of the boulder, he noticed that there was a small opening behind it in the rock wall.     Chapter 3: Into the Abyss   Seb had to check this out. This was becoming exciting to him. It was like he was a little kid and he was exploring unknown areas again. Just like In the Hardy Boys, and Tom Swift books he read as a kid. Well before going any further he had to dress properly. He was becoming chilled since he had slowed his pace for the last quarter of an hour. He took the lightweight Gore-Tex jacket from his trail running pack. He also put his knit hat on to keep his head warm. Seb also removed his small white LED flashlight and S.E.R.E. lock back knife. He put the knife in the pocket of his jacket and held the flashlight with his left hand. Now, Seb was ready to enter this strange little grotto   Chapter 4: Follow Your Nose  As Seb crawled into the cave entrance he was hit with an overpowering odor. The main smell was of decomposing flesh. there was also the unmistakeable sent of chemical Lime. Mixed with an overpowering scent of frankencense and myrrh. Gee what did these christmas scents have to do with decomposing flesh. As he was pondering this thought he heard the faint sound of rythmic chanting. looking in the direction of the chanting he noticed dancing shadows of light on the grotto walls. It looked as if they were coming from torches or a pyre of flame deeper in the bowels of this unholy cave. Seb started to get nervous , and fear gripped him as a cold chill traveled down his spine. He also noticed that the had his knife out and already opened. He was taking no chances, when the smell of death was near. God knows what sort of maniacs were down in this chamber. As Seb stealthly travelled deeper into the cave he could sense that he was going downward. There was still enough ambient light from the flames so he did not need his flashlight yet. Then ahead of Seb there were a set of crudely carved stairs. These stairs led down into a huge chamber. If Seb stayed here above the stairs he could observe this strange meeting undetected. The chanting was very loud here. He tried to decipher what was being said in these chants. It was useless, as this was some long forgotten arcane language. It was gutteral in nature such as in the German language. But he had never heard anything like this in his life. It certainly was not German. "Shit", he thought to himself What has he involved himself in here? Should he turn around right now? Leave this obscene cave and forget about it? Curiousity was much too strong for Sebastian though, he had to know what was going on.   Chapter 5: Welcome to the Party   Looking around the chamber he could see many cloaked figures. As Seb peered closer he counted roughly Thirty five people there. Not to mention the high Priest. The high priest was up on a pedastal roughly a few feet above the assembled cult. There was a make shift alter which looked to be obsidian. A smooth, shiny, black slab laid across two huge rock pillars. There was a large knife on the table along with a huge silver chalice, and a scepter. The man was tall, roughly over six foot three. He was powerfully built, but slender. His biceps rippled as he was leading the chant. He was working the diciples into a frenzy. The Priest was Totally naked except for a huge black goats head he wore. This head piece went to the middle of his chest. There were arcane symbols painted over the rest of his body. They looked like Runes, but they were of no origin that he had knoweledge of. Then as the chanting reached a deafening crescendo, it stopped and there was complete silence. The only sound was that of the crackling of the wood as it burnt on the pyre. and the sizzle of the incense on the coals. This was definately a ritual of undescribable terror and horror. And it was just beginning to take shape   Chapter 6: The main course  Suddenly in a blood curdling animalistic grunt, the priest belched out. "Bring forth the Sacrifice". Then from the left of the room Seb, heard a grating sound and then a womans scream. He looked to the left and saw two squat brutes bringing a shackled woman forward.Actually they were dragging her. You could here her flesh scraping over the rough stone. There was also the sound of the heavy chain clinking and scraping over the rock floor. The girl was shreiking and sobbing intermittenly. She was pleading with them, crying , "Please"...."Please don't hurt me"....."P..P..please let me go" "I...I..won't Tell". "P...Please let me go" Seb wanted to do something , he wanted to rescue this girl, but he was transfixed with morbid curiosity at the scene. He also was smart he knew that all he had as a weapon was a lock blade folding knife, and there were over thirty cultists here. He had to be stealthy and smart, if he was going to rescue her and stay alive. Finally they had drug her to the alter where she was roughly and promptly secured down with a big slippery logging chain. The priest then reached under the alter and withdrew a large galvanized tub. It looked like a watering or feed trough used on farms. He placed in front of the alter . Raising his arms he growled "We must now annoint the Whore Of Babalyon" After saying this he left out a tremendous animalistic roar. The priest squatted down over the bowl and sprayed putrid fecal matter into the tub. It had the sickening sound of wooosh, then splaaat and Seb could smell the rancid stench from his vantage point. Then the unholy congregation followed suit. They lined up one by one filling it with Fecal matter, Urine, and Vomit. The smell of this was overwhelming, even from fifteen feet away. Then The unholy priest raised his knife and cut the woman across the chest. The cut was deep enough to allow a steady stream of blood to run down her side. It then flowed through the blood groove on the alter into the noxious mixture festering in the tub below. The priest then inserted a makeshift funnel in the womans mouth, proceeding to pour this putrid mixture down here throat. He then splashed the remains of it on her body, seeming to wash or purify her with this foul concoction. The girl was vomiting and gasping at the same time, she was choking on her own vomit. The priest then left out a bone chilling bellow of a laugh. As on cue the disciples went wild. They were laughing and whooping and screaming with ecstacy. As the demonic congregation danced with bestial lust. The priest was on his knees looking skyward and rubbing the girls blood over his chest gurgling with ecstacy, as he drank what was left of the foul brew of excrement and blood.  Chapter 7: Time to party   Seb knew that now was the time to make his move. He leaped lighting fast to the nearest cultist. He grabbed the cultist around the neck from behind and drug him back into the shadows from where he had come. Seb then forcefully jammed the knife, up to the hilt into the back of the cultists head, into what the chinese call the "Wind Gate" This insures a quick,silent no reflex kill. He had learned this in combat training. He searched the body, and found a Smith and Wesson .40 caliber automatic pistol. He thought this was strange this looked like a govenment issue Sig Sauer. It even was mag-na-ported for recoil reduction. Seb knew this was no normal pistol. He searched the body a little more closely now. He found that this was no normal man. Finding a wallet, it contained an ID. This was not just any ID it was a U.S. Secret Service ID. "Fuck Me" ! Seb thought...."who The fuck are these people"...What in the fuck had he stumbled upon. Seb took the extra magazines off the dead agent. Standard issue , four extra magazines. Sebastian donned the filthy robe and prepared for combat. He thought that he should strike now due to the general confusion going on. He lept into action at that instant. It's time to party now.   Chapter 8: The host reveals himself   Leaping down the stairs in one great bound , he hit the ground and rolled to his left up into a crouch. Blam, Bang, Blam,Blam, he was hitting the mark today. As every bullet impacted into a body it, fell like ducks at a carnival. The crowd in their bloodlust did not react quick enough. In over thirty seconds their ranks were decimated. The priest did not notice he was too busy carving arcane Runes on the poor girls body. Then suddenly the priest was aware that the insane cacophony was now silent. He slowly turned, only to see one lone person standing in the center of the chamber. This person was thronged with dead and dying bodies of his blasphemous congregation. The man in the center of the chamber threw off his tattered robe. It was Sebastian, standing there in his blood soaked Gore-Tex running jacket. Smoking pistol in hand. He had a demonic look to his cold gray eyes in the firelight. The priest looked nervously around he knew there was no one there to help him. Seb shouted "take off the fucking mask you piece of shit" "Let's see who the fuck you really are Bitch". The priest bellowed back "You will not harm me" "You will never prove this" "I am protected" "I am more powerful than you will ever know" "I am the one you shall worship" "I am your king" "You shall bow to me worm" As the priest said this he pulled off the heavy goats head he was wearing. Seb gasped as he realized who this was. It was the president of the United States, that was above him smiling his usual demonic grin "You cannot do anything" "My power is beyond reach" "I am the king of kings" "I am Rex Mundi" "I am the immortal leader of the illuminati" "Enjoy your short life for now, but remember We will find you" "We always do" "You cannot escape the reach of our tentacles" Saying this , the president as quick as a cheetah turned and scrambled through a small hole behind the alter area. Seb dashed forward trying to capture him. To bring this beastial monstrosity to justice. Unfortunately Sebastian was not quick enough. It seems that the priest had disappeared into a tunnel and it was sealed behind him. Realizing that capturing the president was futile, he checked on the girl hoping to at least save her. As he walked over to her bruatalized body he felt sick. She was a mass of blood, and excrement. He looked closer and realized that her entrails were pulled out of her abdomen. He checked her pulse at her Jugular, but realized sadly, that she was already dead.   Chapter 9: The Last mile to freedom    Seb quickly ran out of this obscene horrid grotto. As he cleared the cavern entrance he had noticed night had fallen. He was running fast now. He made it to the main trail. Faintly at first he heard it. He heard the whop-whop-whop of helicopters. He looked up there were searchlights combing the area. He had to make it across the open area ahead if he had any chance of thawrting his persurers. The copters were not over the open area yet. They were performing a grid search back by the cave. He knew he had just seconds if he was going to make it past the clearing. He sprinted with all his might. Forty feet to go... Twenty feet to go... Ten feet... Five feet....He made it he was back on the tree covered trail. Running at his fastest he wound down the trail. He only had about a mile to go to get to his car. Seb covered this in a short time. When he reached his car he retrieved the keys he had hidden in his usual spot. He got into the car and started the engine. Calming himself, he rationalized,"Just play it cool and you will get out of this safely" winding down the mountain road driving at the speed limit, so as to not draw attention to himself. Seb only had another sharp turn then he was home free. He could hop on the Interstate and be gone without a trace. As Sebastian rounded the turn he saw it. There was a huge roadblock, There had to be thirty State police cars there. He slowed to a stop. As he got out of the car, he saw from the west Four helicopters. "Shit" He thought.They were coming this way. The four helicopters hovered above the police cars. Unexpectedely the police troopers got into their cars and vacated the area. Three of the helicopters hovered in a defensive position as the largest one began it's descent. Wincing as debris and dust stung Sebastian from the rotor wash. The large helicopter landed and shut off its engine. The helicopter was about fifteen feet in front of him. Seb noticed with horror the presidential seal on the side. He knew there was no hope. Sebastian realized there was no escape now. Suddenly from the helicopters loudspeakers, the unmistakeable strains of "Hail To The Chief" Blared. The door slid open and out emerged the president. Half an hour ago he was a satanic priest with fire in his eyes and that ever present demonic grin. He smiled ...then he spoke in a calm manner... "sebastian" "I see you have been quite busy tonight" "As you know , I have also been very busy tonight" "This will never end" "I am ushering in a new world order tonight" "You cannot stop this" "It is quite hopeless to try" "Embrace us Sebastion" "It is our greatest feast day" "Happy Halloween Sebastian" "Happy Halloween" "Muahahahahaaahaaahaaaaaaa......."    The End...................... Or is it a new beginning.................... You be the Judge!
