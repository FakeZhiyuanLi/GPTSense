       Since this is my first entry I'm going to recap on the last few days.&nbsp; Well soccer got rained out&nbsp;Wednesday so I got to come home early to finish packing.&nbsp; I left with my parents around 7:30 to go to pennsylvania.&nbsp; We got there at like 9:30 after a long drive in the rain.&nbsp; Work up early Thursday morning to go visit muhlenberg.&nbsp; I liked the school a lot just wish it was a little bigger, but it was still really nice.&nbsp; I left a tape for the basketball coach, I hope he gets back to me.&nbsp; We then left and traveled another 2 hours to Franklin and Marshall.&nbsp; I loved the campus.&nbsp; When i was walking around i just felt like i belonged. i guess there really is that one right school for everyone.&nbsp; I just hope that id get to play basketball there.&nbsp; if so thats where i want to go.&nbsp; i also got to meet one of the chemistry professors.&nbsp; he was a really cool guy and really liked the research he was doing which made me even more excited about the school.&nbsp; he also liked basketball so maybe he'd be a little easier on my when i had games.&nbsp; we then got on the road again and traveled to gettysburg.&nbsp; On friday morning&nbsp;i had a tour of the school.&nbsp; i liked the school a lot. it was bigger than the others which was nice but you have to take 4 years of a foreign language and that definitly would suck.&nbsp; its not like&nbsp; a french major has to take 4 years of science so its really stupid so that was kind of a turn-off.&nbsp; we then took a&nbsp;tour of the battlegrounds.&nbsp; i never knew how huge it was.&nbsp; it was really interesting.&nbsp; i didn't get to see any ghosts though.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be the best part of the school. all the history of the area makes it more interesting.&nbsp; Then saturday morning we left to go to my basketball tournament.&nbsp; i got so beat up.&nbsp; the first game i poped out my shoulder, jammed my thumb, and hurt my knee.&nbsp; then the second game i got elbowed in the nose.&nbsp; we lost both games that day.&nbsp; then sunday i rolled my ankle and ran into a bleacher and bruised my arm all up.&nbsp; we lost the 2 games that day too so the tournament really sucked...oh well...i finally got to come home though and it was so nice to finally sleep in my own bed.&nbsp;

       urlLink    YEA JERSEY SUNS!! BERMUDA CUP CHAMPS!!!  urlLink       > urlLink More Bermuda Pictures   Bermuda was absolutely amazing!! greatest trip ever...being on an island with friends is so much fun!!!I got to go horseback riding, snorkling, para sailing, and drive a scooter on the left side of the road around town.  boy was that weird.  then to top that we went 3-0 in the tournament and won the bermuda cup so that was awesome.. we go from barely winning any games all season to kicking butt...so cool!! a few bad things happened though; i got food poisoning and couldn't do anything but lay in bed throw up everything that was in my stomach so that was horrible but hey i lost weight...haha...then when i was snorkling me and two of my teamates swam into a jelly fish park like straight out of finding nemo and i got stung 5 times...i was the only one out of the 3 of us to get stung so that sucked then when we made it back to baltimore our battery on the car was dead so we had to wait for an hour for AAA to show up...thats what u get for flying on friday the 13th...but we still made it home and all in all the trip was amazing and i wanna go back!!!

       urlLink    My New Car!!  urlLink     THATS RIGHT I OWN A CAR!!! its a 99 cougar and i love it however i can't drive it yet so it just sits in my driveway. I was supposed to get the car registered and get plates today but my mom screwed up the paper work to put the title in our name and now i have to wait like another 3 weeks till we get a new thing to fill out. im so mad i was so ready to drive my car today. so i guess it still has to sit there. in the meantime i can clean it 300 million times. if the window gets a smudge i have to go clean it. kinda paranoid i know but i just wanna be near my car. so now all my friends have red cars. we're gunna be soooooo cool!!! but something really dumb happened and now i might not get a parking pass for school cuz theyre doing a lottery for passes this year cuz some how we went from over 500 spots to 300 don't ask me how and u need all ur paperwork in by the 24th in order to be in the lottery for the first semester and i won't have my license by then so its really stupid and im really really mad...they should do it by gpa theres no way the 600 and somethingth person needs a parking pass theyre a complete idiot. or do it by involvent someone who goes home and sits on their ass all day after school does not need a parking pass...i dunno whatever the whole thing is messed up and once again the school doesn't think of all the situations

       Today was such a great day.  First I got to sleep till 11:30 which i haven't done in so long so that was amazing.  Then i woke up and worked on a vcd of all the photos from my vacation.  it came out pretty good cept i was only using a trial version so im trying to get the real version and thats getting anoying.  Then me and merry went out to celebrate her getting her license.  we went to applebees then to target to get mitra a get well present.  then we went and visited mitra. im glad shes feeling better.  at mitras i found out i didn't have soccer.  that made me happy.  i went to aau practice and got to see everyone who i hadn't seen in a few weeks so that was cool.  We had a meeting about bermuda which we leave in 4 days!!! YAY!!! Then we just shot around for a little while and then came home.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a good day also which would be todday I guess since its passed 12.

      > urlLink Vacation Pictures  Check out the pictures from my vacation to Minnesota/Wisconsin Dells. The trip was so much fun. It was great to see my family again. i hadn't seen them in 3 years. We flew into wisconsin on thursday afternoon then checked into the hotel. then we walked around the University of Wisconsin campus to make my dad happy then had some dinner at famous Dave's. boy were those good ribs. Then on Friday my dad gave us a little tour of the campus before we left for minnesota. we got to minnesota at like 9 saw my aunt, uncle, and my cousins then went to bed at my grandma's house. Saturday was boring but sunday we went boating and i got to go water skiing. stood up first try it was so cool. then we spent 3 days in the wisonsin dells. we rented a house it was alot of fun. we went to the tommy bartlett show, then went on the wisconsin duck boats then went to water parks. we went to the largest waterpark in america called noah's ark that was alot of fun. then on thursday night we came home. it was upsetting to leave because i don't get to see them very often. hopefully it wont be 3 years again before i get to see them again.
