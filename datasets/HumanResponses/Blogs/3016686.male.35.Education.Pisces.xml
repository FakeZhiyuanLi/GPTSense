      Everybody knows that I love pop music and treat it with the same passion and critical ear that I would any other type of music.    Janet Jackson has always been a really solid pop artist. Her CDs between 1986 and 1993 were  perfect . Now, post  nipplegate ,  when Janet should be seeking to regain credibility (malfunction, my ass!), she releases the turd that is "Damita Jo." Poor J-Ho seems to have fallen victim to the same Diva Curse that afflicted Madonna, Mary J. Blige and many others recently. This CD is a bunch of underbaked midtempos and finger-snap-beat sex ballads that sound like rejects from her '93 "Janet" CD.   Her usual lame-o interludes are here too: last time it was between-take Fran Drescher imitations and this time it's faux interviews about her history. A last-minute attempt to string this record into some kind of autobiographical narrative?   This would be fine if you were a HOOKER and your life revolved around giving head in parked cars.  How many Janet tracks do we need that give her explicit instructions on oral love? Especially if said "head" belongs to jheri-curled midget maestro Jermaine Dupree?  Blech.    Is this all she has to say at 37 years old?  Come back to the rhythm nation, Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson!    The single "I Want You" is somewhat of an Alicia Keys ripoff, but it does have a sort of lush, carefree sweetness. I particularly like the "have your way with me" bridge, which is a tasty come-on, but not dirrrty.  There are maybe 4 other tracks worthy of Janet and the rest is craven drivel.   Anyhoo, I will not link to Amazon: you can pick this one up used and cheap, like the woman herself, at your nearest used CD bin.

      This week's new group choice is Delays. Note that is not  The  Delays. This group is sweet.  Very atmospheric, with perhaps the best CD title I have heard in a long time: " urlLink Faded Seaside Glamour "  (how Morrissey is that?)  Play the sample on the link above.  I like "Long Time Coming."  It's all boys, but you wouldn't know it.  They're vaguely REM-like.  This  urlLink page  has some news clippings at the bottom

      I am afraid to say that "Patience" requires some. It's in sore need of editing. Like most CDs now, it's too long - there are 14 or 15 songs and most are about 6 minutes long.   "Patience" sounds like the studio creation of a man who has not set foot outside his house in the past 5 or 6 years (apparently too busy rolling doobies).  It has a very airless, studio-sealed quality.  The arrangements don't  breathe  the way they did on "Listen Without Prejudice."  They are  grooves  more than  songs .  Havng said that, he adds several songs to his "canon" (!):  "Amazing" is  not , but it's better than Madonna's song of the same name. It's a sweet, midtempo pop love song that would sound great on radio, if they'd ever play it. "Precious Box" is one of the best songs GM has ever written - a bit of social commentary about pop culture / media in the new century.  It would have sounded truly contemporary in  2001 , but it's still propulsive and hooky. Great for night driving.  "My Mother Had A Brother" is a sad song about George's gay uncle killing himself the day George was born.  It's really personal - a message to his dead mother and uncle. It's also one of his finest ballads. The whole record seems very personal:  there are happy memories of his Wham! days ("Round Here") and learn-from-me warnings to a younger generation about self-respect (the excellent "Cars And Trains").  Worst song:  Aside from the previously released craptastic "Freek 04" (which sounds just like "Freeek" which should have been called "Freeek93"it's so clunkily dated) , the worst song is "American Angel" - the gayest song ever recorded.  It's for George's Texan boyfriend and it features gushingly bad lines like this:    Through all of those battles then you came Stepped out of the fading light Said, “Baby I'm American, dry your eyes again, Because I'm here to save your life”   Thank you, Lord God King Bufu. I wish I could say I loved this CD. GM's voice sounds terrific, but most of the songs are just a little bit dated, without being classic. In fact they're bloated, like GM's tummy.  You can hear "Amazing" on  urlLink GM's Sony site  and 30-sec samples of other tracks.

      FINALLY!  The first really exciting music of 2004 is here! It's unexpected too - the previously obtuse  John Frusciante  (of Red Hot Chili Peppers / toothless addict fame) has released a beautiful new CD called "Shadows Collide With People"   Seems like he's taken quite a leap with this record.  According to Lisa, his last solo records were unlistenable noise / noodlings. This one is chock full of strong melodies, Cali alt-pop-rock arrangements and surprisingly good singing.  It's a wee bit too long- 19 tracks, including some instrumentals, that could have been cut by about 4.  The details are there too: the sparing use of vocoder on "The Slaughter" intro, the strong vocals on "Carvel" and the lovely eat-your-heart-out-Richard-Ashcroft lyrics / music of "Ricky." The sound of the CD is reminiscent of the very good 2002 RHCP record "By The Way" - minus their lingering funk and occasionally irritating Anthony Keidis raps.   His  urlLink website  has three full tracks including the aforementioned epic "Carvel" (as in ice cream cake!) - a freaking amazing driving-around-California-in-a-convertible song. That may end up in my top ten songs of the year, at least at the rate we're going so far.  Just click on the Play Music cloud on the main page.   Have been so uninspired by music lately... until this. I urge you to check it out!

      I hyped them last week and this week I got the record, which will be released in the U.S. on May 4. So here's the deal:  I thought I was going to to be  so  original in picking out the Cocteau Twins stylings of Delays, but  urlLink everybody  beat me to it. It's mentioned in every review! You really notice it on my fave song on the CD, "Wanderlust".  This record is as ambient as the album title: you expect to hear seagulls and wind through your headphones. There's also bits of REM and The Sundays here and like "Long Time Coming" reeks of something I cannot pinpont. They cover a lot of ground and despite it being a bit derivative, it still sounds fresh compared to what's out there now.

      If you saw the last Pedro Almodovar movie, "Talk To Her," you may remember that the movie is stopped cold by  urlLink Caetano Velosos's  beautiful, hushed performance of the classic song " urlLink Cucurrucucú Paloma ," filmed at Almodovar's Spanish house.  I had never heard of him until that movie, so I guess Pedro's idea worked.  He's a Brazilian singer who has been a beloved star for about 35 years.    This week he released an English language CD called "A Foreign Sound." It intrigued me because of its various covers:  Nirvana's "Come As You Are," Talking Heads "Nothing But Flowers" mixed with "Cry Me A River" and Cole Porter's "So In Love," among others.  One song that works well for me is the schmaltzy 70's hit "Feelings" - once done to great effect by Lindsey Wagner on the Bionic Woman.  (Jamie Summers went uncercover in a beauty pageant and this song was her talent act, but I digress...)  Caetano's voice is perfect for this song because he never allows it to go over the top. It's actually subtle. Less successful is his version of one of my favorite songs, "Nature Boy."  Something about the stiffness of the arrangement and the rare lack of fluidity in his voice restrains it - it does not move me at all. I'd prefer Celine's  urlLink version  to this one!  You can hear samples of the record at the Nonesuch  urlLink website .  You just need to click on New Releases and look for "A Foreign Sound."

      So I llurrrrve the new CD, the first in several years.  If you don't know The Divine Comedy, "they" are really a "he" - Neil Hannon.  The sound is big and emotional Scott Walkeresque orchestral pop.  It's witty, unabashadly emotional and sometimes a little precious / novelty.  Think "Make It Easy On Yourself," if you know that Walker Brothers song.  I discovered them in England when I bought the 1995 CD "Casanova" on the basis of a quick blurb somewhere, the song titles and the cover art (typical of me).  Luckily I struck gold.  Click  urlLink here  and try a sample of "Something For the Weekend" which is linked to the right.  The new record came out in the UK (only) on March 29.  It's called " urlLink Absent Friends " and it's very good. Lisa and I saw him play an afternoon show in a teensy Arlington club called Iota in 2002 and having been waiting for this music (including "The Happy Goth"!!) ever since. The first single is a sweet narrative song called "Come Home Billy Bird" and you can hear/see it in full at this  urlLink website .  You can also hear other samples at this chic French  urlLink site . Try my favorite, the melodrama "Our Mutual Friend" for a taste of the sweeping strings.  The record adds several great tunes to his future "All My Best" CD. The lyrics are very sweet, but usually with an edge, like the big denoument of "Freedom Road":   Well I've seen the power of the lightning storm, I've seen the endless ears of corn, I've seen the lakes at the break of day, And that shit takes my breath away   As usual, there are some tracks that induce dry heaves, but those are just a couple of lugubrious ballads and a cutesy tootsy song about imaginary friends. Please also note that hearing it on the web won't do it justice. When I finally played it on headphones, it made me all emotional.  If you want a little mix, let me know!

      It's news to me!! From the  urlLink Record Collection  website:   John Frusciante recordings will now be coming out on the Record Collection label. There are six releases scheduled at this time, all expected to be out before the years end. The first of these is called  urlLink The Will to Death . It will be in stores June 22nd and will be under his own name... John has been recording one full length album every month this year and would like to release them about that often.     Question: Will this be as good as "Shadows Collide with People" or will it be unlistenable gobbledygook? (see first week of this blog)

      I just bought the Tori CD/live DVD, " urlLink Welcome to Sunny Florida ". When I watched few of the songs like "Cloud On My Tongue" or "Precious Things" I remembered how amazing she is and how much she was a part of the 90's for me. "Precious Things" really is an estrogen version of Metallica - female rage in song. The version of "Your Cloud" adds some new words and is sublime. That's a recent song and a particularly lucid one- no gobbledygook, just perfect lyrics - Tori still has it.  There are two GREAT interviews. One with her (some of it verrrrry new-agey about sound "shapes") and another with her parents who are in her dressing room. Her mom sounds like her (vocally) and is v. cute. The daughter is seen in the video too.   The freebie CD has 6 studio songs: 3 were recent b-sides and 3 are new. The best of the new is "Ruby Through the Looking Glass" - a "gender" song that is gorgeous. "Seaside" is the best of the b-sides - I think it's about terrorism and those images are juxtaposed with scenes of her daughter playing at the beach ("I had to laugh when she gave sand a bath").    You would never know how beautiful Tori is from watching this video. She looks like her hair is falling out and she has a fucking UGLY dress for the show! But in the other bits she looks great - at one point she is standing just inside from the rain asking for an umbrella for her shoes, which are pretty hot shoes. She also looks amazing in the "yearbook" part, so why so bad for the show?  urlLink See this pic of Pretty Tori from the packaging .  One teaser: wait till you see what she does before she goes on stage. Some clues: it involves a makeshift altar; she gets on her knees and there's oil and candles and shit.  The DVD makes much of the fact that she is part Indian, but good gravy Marie!

      From the NY Daily News:   Somewhere over Massachusetts is a sparrow who apparently doesn't care for '80s rock.  Cyndi Lauper was reaching for a high note during her opening number at Saturday's KISS-108-sponsored concert in Mansfield, Mass., when from the sky came a white glob of bird poop.  The fecal critique landed in her open mouth.  Showing more aplomb than Tippi Hedren ever displayed in "The Birds," the Brooklyn-born rocker wiped her tongue on her sleeve and kept on rockin'.   The 50-year-old singer did kvetch backstage that a bird once plopped on her head while she was on stage.   "My grandmother says it's good luck, but I think it's disgusting," she moaned.   Maybe birds just want to have fun.

      I didn't even know that one of my favorite artists was releasing a record today!   How can that be, pray tell?   urlLink Maura O'Connell's  new CD is called "Don't I Know."  I loves me some Maura, though her last CD was such a dud for me that I listened to it fully only once.  Back with her good producer, Jerry Douglas, the songs on this one are  much  better, though I still have an issue (which surfaced on the crappy CD) with how her voice is recorded and mized. I think the idea is to have her sound intimate, as if she is whispering in her ear, but the end result is that she's mixed a little low and a little "flat." She needs a smidge of reverb, like she has in the live shows. If you don't know Maura at all, every one who loves country, folk and alt pop should purchase " urlLink Blue Is The Colour of Hope " (start with "The Blue Train") or " urlLink Stories " (start with "Half Moon Bay") and be mesmerized by a) the great songs written for her and b) her beautiful thick honey voice.

      NOTE:  This post shocked a few "readers," so be forewarned that 1) it's not something to read at work and 2) I think it's  funny  and I will not cave to the censorious J-Ho Jackson militia!  Okay, read on:  Recently RuPaul published (on  urlLink his blog ) what he called his favorite fan letter of all time. Here is an excerpt that will surely haunt you after reading. Please note that I have actually deleted the NASTIEST BITS in favor of the funny bits. It was 50% longer than what you see below:   Dear RuPaul,  I don't even no how to beg-gan. I am not gay or bi-sexual, but even though you are a Drag Queen, you are so sexy and lustful, I can't help but masturbate to you. I masturbate to your sexy website, I masturbate to your sexy music videos, and I even masturbate to the nasty, pulsating beat of your music...I want to dress in drag myself as sexy Lil Kim as we suck each others hard and juicey cocks.  As you can see Ru, I love to use the word BEGGING a lot. To me, BEGGING is something that's very sexy. Not standing on the street corner BEGGING for money, (unless you are a sexy prostitute or hoochie mama dressed in skimpy booty shorts with a matching halter top and shiny leather thigh high boots with six inch heels and a sexy hair due, sucking on a big deal pickle, Begging for a trick).   Believe it or not RuPaul, but I'm your biggest fan. I dream of having freaky sex with you everyday. I would love to meat you and fuck you one day. If not, then I guess I will just have to continue beating my hard and swollen dick into a soft and sribbled nub, and you don't want that do you?  Your biggest fan, Billy Bee / Billy The Beggar

      The title track from Fiona Apple's new CD has leaked. I am not sure what the legalities are so I am justy posting a link to the  urlLink Velvet Rope thread  that has the link at the top.  Warning: it's totally different from her other work - it's very Broadway. Rolling Stone calls the song a  "Tin Pan Alley-esque blend of Tom Waits and Vaudeville."  Sony has decided not to release the CD despite the fact she is one of their most serious artists (Jon Brion, the producer, talks about it  urlLink here ). Sony SUCKS and they should remember the Wilco story.   I hope the record isn't all like this, but it is a fun song and has the usual Fiona linguistic play on the lyrics.

      So yesterday I had to chance to see the one DC "talking head" I have always wanted to see. I don't usually  speak  to famous people when I see them, though I do tend to look them in the eye. But I always said that if I ever met Michele Martin of ABC News ("This Week") and PBS ("Washington Week"), that I would tell her what a  right-on  woman I think she is. I had a whole 30-second speech planned out.   Yesterday, June 17, on my way home, my moment arrived. The lovely Michele Martin was getting into a cab near the ABC studios off of Conn Ave and was talking to 2 teenage girls standing about 10 feet away from her. Not sure who they were, but I don't think they were her kids (she just had a baby). I tried  ever so  to be polite and not interrupt, so I slowed way down, waiting for my window of opportunity. When it became clear they weren't going to stop talking, I went for broke. Standing in the middle of the street between Filene's and The Mayflower I rooted myself into the cement, pointed at her (which caught her eye) and screamed  I love you - you ROCK!  (emphasis on rock). She was about 20 feet away and looked at me and yelled back -not missing a beat-  "Thank  you, but don't tell me, tell them!" nodding to the girls. I have no idea who they were, but the girls didn't see me and I just kept going.  It was not your usual DC encounter, but I think I made my point, albeit looking like a slightly crazed fan in the process.   Here is a photo/bio of  urlLink Michele, my belle .

      Minor tragedy struck tonight when a CD got stuck in my fancy CD Recorder machine - the one attached to my stereo system (vs. computer).  This beloved machine has made a million CD mixes over the past 5 years or so.  I may be able to salvage it if I can open it up, but I don't have my toolbox right now. Regardless, I may have caused Shaken CDR Syndrome by shaking it and tipping it upside down, etc.  The cruel joke is that it happened while I was taking a song or two off a disc I wanted to sell - a hideous BRANDY CD! I know, I know...  Anyway, pray my box that makes music.

      In the Continued Bilking of the Decomposed Department: Jeff Buckley's enterprising mother is continuing to "preserve his legacy" by releasing a 3-disc special edition of Grace. Check out details on Dead Jeff's  urlLink website . I'll probably buy this one as it may be worthy, unlike the other special releases.

      I have been at a loss for how to describe what may end up my favorite CD of the year, Keane's "Hopes and Fears," which I bought in England and played incessantly the whole time. But yesterday I found this comment on  urlLink Popjustice  and I thought, "That's it- the perfect review!"    Keane is the Bananarama of the milkman world...   If I didn't say it before, Keane initially comes across as derivative. As if Chris Martin had cornholed Franny Travis and out popped a pudgy baby Keane. But that's not fair. The CD also reminds me of Ultravox and China Crisis (a tidbit of the electronic) as well as Travis and Coldplay, but the songs are so good it stands on its own. Not a lot of hotness or hardness here, but this record is probably going to end up as my album of the year because it is so fucking gorgeous. Yes, it is actually out in America, so no excuses.  Key tracks: All of it's good, but I will pick  Everybody's Changing , Your  Eyes Open  (my fave- check it out on iTunes or Musicmatch) and  This Is The Last Time . A reluctant link to their  urlLink website , which I find troublesome even on my souped new computer at work.

       urlLink Girls Aloud :  Why do we like them? Because we like British girl groups. Because they actually have decent songwriters, even though they were discovered on an American/Pop Idol ripoff TV show. We like that they release a new CD every year, flouting American pop rules (short shelf life!). We love THIS group because they have one roughneck chick who beats other girls in da clubs.  Their last hit was a really good version of the Pointer Sisters "Jump." Sadly, they have ditched their 80's look, though not the 80's sound. But we really  like this chorus:    Should've known, should've cared, should've hung 'round the kitchen in my underwear...

      Sometime in 2003, I was in a funky store and heard a dance track I liked so much that I immediately wrote down a few lines of lyrics on scrap paper so I could Google it. The song turned out to be "Deepest Blue" by  urlLink Deepest Blue , an Ibiza dance hit that should have just been a one-off anonymous track from "A Ministry of Sound" club collection. But it was too good, so the creators decided to do another song and then another and now they have a lovely poppy Euro CD called "Late September" released in Europe and the UK in... mid June!  (no US date yet)  That song turned out to be, perhaps, my favorite song of 2003. It never wears out. The CD is more of the same - one catchy, albeit slightly faceless, pop track after another. Both uptempo and moody midtempo. If you care about melody, this one's for you. Reference points, should you need them, are Chicane and Savage Garden; you can listen to samples on the site.

      So I have just come from seeing  urlLink Madonna’s show  where we were a part of what she called the best crowd of the tour so far. Sadly, we had CRAP seats up high on the side of the stage, so I missed much of the show as it was intended to be seen. We were the mizzies up there - les miserables – who got half a show. Missed the  urlLink whole opening segment . Thank God for the video screen.  My favorites: "Vogue" was the opener, a Dangerous Liaisons version with impossible looking  urlLink yoga poses . Very  urlLink bendy ! Her  urlLink costume  was great (Lacroix sweetie?) and she looked really beautiful on the screen. Not sure about up close!   "Mother and Father" is an 80's electroclash song on the new record, but it’s turned into a big mid-tempo centerpiece in this show. Great singing on this one, despite the fact she didn’t cut the ridiculous rap bit, which includes such genius rhymes as: "My father had to go to work / I used to think he was a jerk."   "Crazy For You” was one of the most emotional songs, at least for anyone who is old enough to remember when that song came out. She was  urlLink alone  a lot more on the stage this tour, perhaps b/c she is damn old and cannot do the constant dancing. The result was more of a connection with the audience. I suppose “Imagine” (yes, that one) was supposed to be the emotional centerpiece, but - as always - the gears do show.  People admire Madonna's work ethic because you can SEE it - see her working. That’s not really the way it should be, but it's part of her charm.  On "Imagine" she did a good job, but she was trying too hard and the song lost something for me (aside from the fact it's just an overheard song).  “Crazy For You” was more about her singing to the audience without appearing to think about it so much.  GREAT version of  “ urlLink American Life ,” a song I dislike. Very heavy metal, but we weren’t able to really get the full effect of the visuals from our seats. It was silly and serious at the same time.    Not so great: I totally disliked the whole  urlLink circus part  of the show, which was Vegas kitschy and too Janet Jackson for my taste. She did the AWFUL ”Hanky Panky” and a strange, jazzy version of "Deeper And Deeper" The oddest part here was how she performed “Die Another Day” in this circus costume - didn’t work.    The  urlLink finale  was "Music:" and "Holiday" with both changed a little bit, but neither quite as the Drowned World Tour versions.  Why do the same finale on this tour?   Fave dance moves: one of the songs had a momentary tango with Madonna and 5 men, but they were all attached: she danced with one and the others gripped each other's arms. It probably looked strange at eye level, but was really clever form the nosebleeds (ah-ha!).  “Papa Don’t Preach” had a sort of ring-around-the-rosie bit that finished the song with them holding hands and spinning as the lights went down. V good.  The dancers in this show are athletes who have to do amazing feats: scary extreme skateboarding, drum'n'bugle-esque gun twirling, breakdancing, dancing with  urlLink sticks , scary trapeze work.   On "Into The Groove" they had the num chuck things but nobody knocked out their own teeth. How they live through each night I don't know.  From our seats we could also see that the floor was constantly opening and sinking and rising, which must be another hazard.  An onstage conveyor belt made for some cool moves (borrowed from her '87 tour) and the  urlLink bagpiper’s  dancing was a surprise.   On her last tour, my favorite song was La Isla Bonita because a) it was an oldie and b) it was sweet and she seemed to be enjoying herself.  This WHOLE show is like that. Much more smiling and much less pretension.  urlLink email me

      I happened to have Vh1 on this morning and a song came on that I really liked. It's called "Happy People" and it reminds me of Stevie Wonder when he was great. The problem is a nasty one: it's by R Kelly!  Blech!  I have always been very democratic about where I get my music: there are no rules. But maybe there should be? Do I really want to support an artist who films himself peeing on 15 year olds (and then has the cajones to say, "That's not me!")?  Anyway, Kelly is a brilliant PR person - the end of the video features people in different settings (bedroom, funeral home) dancing to the video as it plays on a TV.  See, EVERYBODY LOVES R Kelly. Then he does something to guarantee success:  he adds a "move to the left/move to the right" coda.  Just the type of thing that will be played at weddings everywhere. Urghhhhhh.  Of course, did anyone think about the shot of him popping the champagne and having it spew everywhere?  Sadly, they probably did.  urlLink email me

      Go to this  urlLink link  and look for the Kings Of Convenience video midpage. I love this song - it's called "Misread" and it's from their new CD, "Riot On An Empty Street."  The geeky guy in the video is the esteemed Erlend Oye (the one who shakes the tree), who did a cutting edge electronic CD in 2003 ("Unrest," with one of my favorite songs of last year, "Like Gold"). The other other guy in the video, Eirik, became a shrink in the time since the last KOC CD, but Erlend somehow convinced him to do another one. Lucky for us.  I haven't heard anything but samples, but I DO know that the new record continues the last one's cover art drama.  urlLink Last time , as Eirik nuzzled his girlfriend, Erlend was almost pushed out of the picture. This time, it appears that Erlend is getting even and exchanging a  urlLink knowing glance  with the girl, while Eirik preens for the camera. However, I  don't  think they are a kinky threesome, because the song is too lovely - like a Norwegian Simon and Garfunkel with a bit of bossa nova.  Did Simon and Garfunkel do threesomes?

      Another inane Amazon customer review - this one for a CD that will not be released until SEPTEMBER 2004  "Christine McVie Rocks!!!" says Reviewer Chris from USA on April 15    Obviously, the record has not come out yet, but it will be great. I would bet my life on it. Afterall, has Christine ever written a bad song? I don't think so! As a valuable member of Fleetwood Mac for 25 years, Christine has defined herself as a classy, talanted pop-rock artist. This is sure to be her best work yet! We are so lucky that she is releasing this and is not being dismissed as an old rocker. Christine can rock harder then any of the young people of today and one can only hope she'll have a hit song and will prove that she is the queen of pop!

      Gee, I don't belong to iTunes, but since Rufus is the Greatest Living Artist Since Kate Bush, I'd guess I should join now.  Because his label is a shitstorm, Rufus is doing a  urlLink teaser on iTUnes  and then releasing "Want 2" or a series of EPs before the end of the year.  Here are some song titles from it: Gay Messiah, I'm Not Ready, The Art Teacher and Homegrown Waltz.  Bit of The Art Teacher lyrics:   There I was in uniform  Looking at the art teacher.  I was just a girl then;  Never have I loved since then.  He was not that much older than I was  He had taken our class to the Metropolitan Museum.  He asked us what our favorite work of art was,  But never could I tell it was him.  Oh, I wish I could tell him-- Oh, I wish I could have told him.

       The Honeymoon . Pretend that The Sundays had twins: a boy and a girl. The boy grew up liking French bands like Air and Phoenix. The girl claimed to idolize Nina Persson of The Cardigans, but secretly played Avril Lavingne and Hillary Duff in her room at night. One day these two pretty teens sneaked into the basement to record an album called   Dialogue  .  A few weeks ago  urlLink I alluded  to Sophia Coppola when describing The Honeymoon.  Boyohboy  was I wrong when I heard the full CD. They are way too poppy to be called indie. Sophia would not copy this CD for Marc Jacobs! Their new single "Truth Hurts" is a fine pop song, but the sickly sweet vocals, crunchy chords and the techno sheen over the music suggest that they have read the Matrix (producers of Lavigne and Duff) rule book and used every trick in one song.  "Passive Aggressive" remains a favorite of the year for me - the title reveals it self in the fucked up romance of the lyrics. "I Don't Know What To Say" merges verses reminiscent of Corey Hart with a chorus straight from Enya. "Come Undone" is an ode to their "parents", The Sundays, but with trippier production. I am not sure these two have a big future. Methinks  Dialogue  will be their only CD, but I heartily recommend it. They are neither indie enough or pop enough to fare well inthis black and white world, so maybe they can produce better songs for the tweenyboppers on the radio.

       kd lang's  Hymn of The 49th Parallel   is her best record since  Ingenue . It's a covers album of Canadian songwriters. When you find a singer as good as kd, you need to also find songs worthy of her voice. She does that consistently on this album ( urlLink samples here ).  kd's Joni Mitchell covers here are very faithful. On "Jericho," a song about maintaining a relationship, kd sounds as if she'd stepped into the 1970's to use Joni's arranger. This is a good choice because it has  perfect  lyrics, but not everyone knows the song because it was on Joni's obscure "Don Juan..." album. My favorite bit:    Let these walls come tumbling down now     Let them fall right on the ground     Let all these dogs go running free     The wild and the gentle dogs     Kenneled in me    The revelations for me are the lesser known songs, such as both Jane Siberry compositions, in particular "The Valley" - she nails the little vocal yodel ("you will wa-a-a-alk") of the chorus perfectly! I used to buy Jane's CDs and then...not. This makes me miss her. I knew both of the Siberry songs on this record, but both seem better to me when kd does them. It's true that kd emphasizes the pop in folk/pop, but on Jane's record "The Valley" is a bit meandering and her it is concise. The hook is elegant because it's used so sparingly in both versions. "Love Is Everything" is just a  majestic  breakup song - I don't quite like the way kd changes the words in the bridge (see lyric booklet and compare), but her voice was made to belt this song.  My favorites on this record remain the Neil Young songs. If I was kd's agent, I would get her into the studio to record one each week.  A very moving album - should be in my top ten of the year.

      Last night was the  Finn Brothers  show and it was, not surprisingly, brilliant. They did "Six Months In A Leaky Boat," a rousing "There Goes God" and - thank&nbsp;God - "Four Seasons In One Day." One of the new songs, "Gentle Hum," gave me chills because they stopped the music and the audience hummed.&nbsp;It was a new song, but people seemed to get it.   Lisa and I were discussing Neil Finn's voice recently.&nbsp;It's always so amazingly strong live - it doesn't wear out, even though it seems like the kind of voice that would. I think he  does  get credit as one of the best modern songwriters, but people never mention what a great vocalist he is.&nbsp;   Tim Finn was a crazy-man dancer and told a funny story about how he met a woman at the YMCA here (just around the corner from my work!) and promised he'd put her on the list, but uncharacteristically forgot to do it.&nbsp; "Is Valentina here? Did you have to pay? Valentina?!"&nbsp;It was a good segue moment because Neil quipped, "I am sure she will suffer never" and then they played "Suffer Never," which turned into a Sonic Youth Moment.&nbsp; They had a breakdown bit&nbsp;with all this weird feedback - they were all kneeling in front of their monitors fiddling to get the noise!   Here is (most of?) the set list, in no order,&nbsp;from  urlLink Frenz.com  . I will correct it when someone posts the&nbsp;proper&nbsp;one.   &nbsp;   Anything Can Happen, Weather With You, History Never Repeats, A Life Between Us, All God's Children, Gentle Hum,&nbsp; Won't Give In,&nbsp; Luckiest Man Alive, Edible Flowers,&nbsp; Nothing Wrong With You,&nbsp;All The Colors,   Suffer Never, Angel's Heap, There Goes God, It's Only Natural, Weather With You, Four Seasons In One Day,&nbsp; I Got You,&nbsp; I See Red,&nbsp; Six Months In A Leaky Boat/Pioneer.

      When I avoid reviewing a CD, it's usually&nbsp;because a) it is&nbsp;too good and my comments will be&nbsp; overly laden with "gorgeous"  OR  b) I don't want to admit I don't like it.&nbsp;At 14 tracks, the new Badly Drawn Boy CD,&nbsp;   urlLink One Plus One Is One ,   is about 4 too long.&nbsp;  And I don't like it.  Damon Gough's songs wind around like a slow, drunken drivers who have no home or destination. Perhaps the genius  About A Boy  soundtrack ( AAB ) succeeded because he had such a specific assignment?  Write about A, B and C and intersperse it with sweet little instrumentals.       urlLink "Easy Love"  sounds like it could have been on  AAB  - it's plaintive and honest. Likewise,  urlLink "The Year Of The Rat"  is a worthy first single. It' s classic BDB. He even manages to pull off a children's choir, which usually makes a song sound cloying. In this case, the kiddies sibilant "everybody needsh to know itsh the year of the rat" is endearing. Maybe he should do an alternate mix with Liza Minelli?    urlLink "Four Leaf Clover"  sounds like it has been running for 10 mins when you're only 3 minutes in. The man needs an editor (see this website page for  urlLink a visual example ). Toward the end, all the songs blend and you can't even tell where one begins or ends. There is flute, piano, bass, guitar, backwards vocals and more kiddies.&nbsp;Too much!&nbsp; Sadly this is BDB's second dud CD - I didn't like the last one either.&nbsp; How many chances does one get before it adds up to  zero ?

It's&nbsp;a covers album of&nbsp;songs by Canadian songwriters, including Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen and Ron Sexsmith (who is still in his&nbsp;prime). &nbsp;You can already sample her brilliant cover of Neil Young's&nbsp;"Helpless" on itunes (or just get  urlLink snippets of a few songs  on Amazon).&nbsp;I played it over and over yesterday.&nbsp;   I don't have a recent picture of kd, but the last time I saw her I realized that  urlLink Clay Aiken  has sort of stolen her look!&nbsp;

      From  urlLink Michael Musto  (I saw it before  urlLink gawker !)    BRITNEY SPEARS has been engaged for at least 20 minutes, and I just want to say, bravo, girl! (Oh, I'm sure it won't last through the year, but at least Brit's doing what she wants for a change, complete with Kirstie-style ballooning and dangerous nips of ginseng.  Practically from birth, she's been squeezed dry by the people around her, who've never turned down a single appearance, tour, video, endorsement, or any other chance to make change pop out of her vagina.  They've almost worked the girl to death and now she's finally breaking free, learning the hard way via her own rotten decisions.)

      The Trash Can Sinatras have a new CD called  Weightlifting  coming out later in the summer.&nbsp; They made an appearance on KCRW on my birthday in March (in honour - sp! - of me?).&nbsp; You can hear some of the new songs if  urlLink you play it .

      From a Velvet Rope poster, in reference to Minnie Driver's head: "It's like an orange on top of a toothpick. She'll cry herself to sleep tonight on her huge pillow."   Anne reports that the VR poster was quoting the movie "So I Married An Axe Murderer" and that the above quote is best read in a  Scottish accent .

        urlLink The Hidden Cameras   sound so sweet but they are not for the faint of heart.&nbsp;Lisa introduced me to&nbsp;them and their first CD, called  urlLink  The Smell Of Our&nbsp;Own   and now they have a new record out in England called  urlLink  Mississauga Goddam   (a clever play on "Mississippi Goddamn" by Nina Simone).&nbsp; It's due out here in September. They're Canadian and&nbsp;sound is folky and very choral - kind of like Belle And Sebastian with harmonies (am I right?). They have also been called&nbsp;the&nbsp;Gay Polyphonic Spree, which is apt.  But children beware:  the sweet voices mask rannnnndy lyrics. A sample of " urlLink Golden Streams " here:  &nbsp;   The golden stone builds the golden road to heaven    Held up high by golden streams of ice    My golden bone meets the golden buns    Buns held high in our dreams of men   &nbsp;  And that is  minor  compared to the lyrics of " urlLink The Man That I Am With My Man "!! It all&nbsp;reads as crackpot, yet they  are &nbsp;amusing on record. The new record has titles like "Music Is My Boyfriend," "I&nbsp;Want Another Enema" and&nbsp;&nbsp;"Builds The Bone," but somehow this group adds up to more than novelty and they are getting  urlLink good reviews .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Note that Amazon has them linked with The Shins,&nbsp;Postal Service, Broken Social Scene and Death Cab for Cutie, among&nbsp;others.&nbsp; Just to give&nbsp;you a reference point or four!&nbsp;I don't have the new record, but if I hear it, I will comment on the blog. It's a big hit on  urlLink Popjustice , my new fave site.

       urlLink    Last week I mentioned my interest in a new group, Honeymoon. Here is what they look like. Anyway, they have updated their  urlLink website .&nbsp; They got some terrible reviews, but&nbsp;damn them all,  I heart Honeymoon!

      Yes, how many  Minnie Drivers  can there be?&nbsp;Not sure her voice is really original enough to make an impact, but I have heard worse. The problem is the songs. The title track and "Down" are okay, IMO, but her music is really&nbsp;lifeless and slowwwwwww.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;four songs to sample from  urlLink Everything In My Pocket &nbsp;on her site.

      Bjork is not using musicians on her CD, but she IS using a human beatbox.  Justine Timberod must be crushed that he was not asked to assume that role. Anyhoo, here is the artsy fartsy sounding tracklisting:  1. Pleasure Is All Mine  2. Show Me Forgiveness  3. Where Is the Line?  4. Vokuro  5. Oll Birtan  6. Who Is It (Carry My Joy on the Left, Carry My Pain on the Right)  7. Submarine  8. Desired Constellation  9. Oceania  10. Sonnets/Unrealities XI  11. Piano II  12. Mouths Cradle  13. Wednesday (Midvikudags)  14. Triumph of a Heart

      This is too funny - a website called  urlLink Awful Plastic Surgery.  The top part is George Michael, but the really notable one is Lance Bass toward the bottom of the page. That is some insane shit! Totally new face.   For all you 80's hags there are some scary pictures of Marilyn - the Boy George protege, who now looks like an old crone.

      Her new CD Medulla will be  urlLink voices only, no instruments . Here is what she tells W Mag:   "I just got really bored with instruments. I started doing everything with my voice. Then suddenly I didn't want to work with any musicians, which is a bit weird. I only wanted to work with vocalists." She was inspired, she says, by paganism, and the rather esoteric idea of returning to a universe that is entirely human -- without tools or religion or nationalities. "I wanted the record to be like muscle, blood, flesh," she says, pumping her fist. "We could be in a cave somewhere and one person would start singing, and another person would sing a beat and then the next person sing a melody, and you could just kind of be really happy in your cave. It's quite rootsy," she adds, rolling the "r" for emphasis in her native fashion.

      She's  jumped the shark  and become a  urlLink sex columnist on Nerve  (that is not a link for the workplace, FYI). Who does she think she is fooling? Does her new Avril-aged fanbase read Nerve? Regardless, thin Lizzy is no  urlLink Dan Savage  - her column tends toward this kind of statement:   One more thing: I didn't hear you say you loved him. If he's not doing it for you, get a different boyfriend. Find someone you can love, and the sex will be better   Yawwwwn. Someone on the  urlLink Velvet Rope  cleverly suggested that  "the responses to two of the five questions on this link were actually written by The Matrix."  (a bit of an industry joke)

      A duo. He British. She Icelandic. Both sing and  urlLink aren't they cute?  To me this group is, to quote the articulate Neil Sedaka (then speaking of Clay Aiken), "ear delicious."  Honeymoon describe it this way:   "The songs are gentle because they're like a one on one dialogue. You wouldn't scream into someone's ear if you're sitting close to them..."It's like sexy, Sunday music."    " urlLink Passive Aggressive " is the kind of gorgeous modern music I picture Sofia Coppola listening to while sipping a Tazo Peach tea in her backyard. "I urlLink  Don't Know What To Say " is a little airier and reminds me of something from the 70's, but I cannot pinpoint.   What's really amusing is that the 3AM Girls - gossip queens in London -  urlLink chatted them up  in their column last week. The record, which will most likely make my Top Ten of 2004, is called  urlLink Dialog  and came out out on July 12 in the UK only. Pffft.

      Getting UK Poppy this week, but all of these tracks have  balls .   Javine  " urlLink  Surrender  " Although she is channeling Whitney and Jennifer Garner in the video, it's Beyonce that should be on the defensive. She's got the legs, the hair,  the horns . LOVE this.   Girls Aloud "The Show"  Wall of sound electropop, Bananarama as sluts. Can;t find a working link to the song yet. Sorreeeee.  Kelis  " urlLink Trick Me " Yes, it's vaguely reggae, but not enough to irritate. She is cute and FUN and the album is solid.   Fried " urlLink Get Out Of Jail "   Horrible band name, good modern soul. Created by one of Fine Young  Cannibals. They stole the premise of the song from an Alicia Keys video, so jail it may be...

      You'd never know Phoneix is French and I suspect they don't care! I first got interested in them with  urlLink "Too Young"  an 80's sounding pop song used briefly in "Lost In Translation." Now they have a new CD called   urlLink Alphabetical    (out here on 7/27)which I do not yet own. Take a look at the Roman Coppola-directed video for their new song  urlLink "Everything Is Everything"  - the band is more clever aurally than visually, that is for sure. I'll review the CD when I get it, really I will.

       BLUE NILE   finally  has a new CD ready! It's been  ten years  since the last.  The new one is called  High  and is due out on August 30 on Sanctuary Records. Read a Scottish newspaper article about it  urlLink here . If you don't know Blue Nile, do your  urlLink research .   ALISON MOYET  is also releasing a new CD called  Voice  in September, on Sanctuary Records, which my doppleganger must be running! I suspect it will be a stringy CD because it's being produced by Anne Dudley, who has done strings for  everyone . This record mixes oldies (including "Cry Me A River" and recent Bacharach/Costello song "God Give Me Strength") with new songs. Her last record was her first in like 10 years and was really lovely.  urlLink A good fansite .    PAUL WELLER  has a new single in August that's a cover of "Wishing On A Star" by Rose Royce. It's form his new covers CD called  Studio 150 .  His  urlLink new website  is clunky, FYI.   ERASURE  (this is for Jason!) have a new CD called   urlLink Nightbird   (hello Stevie Nicks) and a new single called "Breathe" (haven't they already released a single called "Breathe"? Doesn't everyone at some point?). Anyhoo, the whole shebang has been delayed until January 2005.   I guess I should note that  DURAN DURAN   finally  signed with Epic (not Sanctuary, who are wise to avoid this money pit). They trashed much of what they had been working on and are now working with Rich Harrison and Dallas Austin, which means this new record (due in October?) may be a  pukey hiphop record .  Attempts toward the trendy will  fail , old men.

      Neil and Tim's  urlLink album cover .  Tim is looking old, but Neil always manages to look the same!  I purchased their new EP from iTunes and I am relieved to say the songs are good.  All 3 are strong in melody and lyric - and none have the airy Maori sound of Neil's solo work over the last few years.

      You can hear songs from the new  urlLink PJ Harvey  album  urlLink here . The album as a whole is much harder than her last (which was fucking brilliant). It's a bit too much for me, but I do like "No Child Of Mine" (a wee song), "The Darker Days Of Me And Him," "Shame" and (the single) "The Letter."   PS: The first song isn't bad either .

         urlLink  REM's   new album is called  Around The Sun  and it's out on Oct 5. The single is "Leaving New York" - gee, what is that about?!    urlLink Simple Minds   are old enough to have a 5 disc box set called   urlLink Silver Box   that has no previously released material. Good Lord. For the hardcore fans - are they called  simpletons?     urlLink The Blue Nile's   album includes the beautiful song "Soul Boy" that Paul wrote for Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) - the only good song on her last (and last?) album. More  urlLink here , from a fan    urlLink Kirsty MacColl   finally gets a 3 CD box set. The tracklist (you have to go through 3 screens starting with  urlLink this link ) covers everything important, plus tons of rarities. I still am sad that she died.

       and her artsy fartsy media blitz has begun...   urlLink     You can hear two new  Medulla  tracks courtesy of BBC's  urlLink Breezeblock . They play "The Pleasure Is All Mine" at about 19:18 and "Mouth's Cradle" at about 20:49. Note you can fast forward to the tracks. "Pleasure" is very challenging - the melody is hard to detect, if it's there at all. "Mouth's Cradle" is a bit more traditionally Bjorkian and the voices mimic instruments. Remixes please! Tidbit:  Medulla  was recorded in  18 places .
