      take this burden i cant hold on much longer take this burden off of my shoulders  my heart weighs heavy with the weight of these rocks i dont need to speak my expression is the one that talks stress and weariness are all that i can feel here it is, ill make you a deal if you take this pain away ill wear your dress  take this burden i cant hold on much longer take this burden off of my shoulders  i feel like atlas with the weight of the world resting on me alone but hes got nothing compared to me his problems are a cup of tea someone answer the goddamn phone just order me up a syringe fill it to the top with the best pain reliever and let me binge i want it all, this aint no test  take this burden  i cant hold on much longer take this burden off of my shoulders  i can see some of the others who share my predicament but how am i supposed to help them  when i cant even pay my rent if the ground would just swallow me up and the sky would just cloud up then maybe i could feel something other than this evil  take this burden i cant hold on much longer take this burden off of my shoulders  the pain relieved my burden shared i owe my life to whoever dared to help me out in my time of need and dig me out of this avalanche of dispair and greed i realize that i could have  held up my end of the burden but its all unloaded on someone else  you took this burden let me take it back you took my burden and you took up the slack  in case of emergency, pull handle all lyrics copywrite icoeph 2004, all rights reserved

      one last try here it comes no longer can i lie she cries as she runs  here i am on my knees it is your eyes that i try to please i changed myself the old me is up up on a shelf forgotten by true friends disliked by the new as i look in the mirror i see myself askew  one last try here it comes no longer can i lie i shout as i run  you altered me changed more than my looks undoubtedly i was hooked and i stood by while i watched myself slip away and die but no longer the last try crept up and i took it on i wrestled with it and in the end i won  one last try here it comes no longer can you lie she screams as she runs  obviously i cant wear this mask i can only wear my own i cant stand to see you cry or hear that certain tone your voice is so cammanding so harsh and so demanding if i pretend any longer ill surely be a goner what is that shaking what is this feeling  it seems that i am failing my head is reeling  one last try here it comes one last lie her tears run  she hasnt seen how she has affected me how it hurts now and how im ashamed constantly of what ive become the faithful friends become outsiders that voice in my head is no longer my own even so it tells me that this is wrong i must put an end to this long charade im sorry i have to rain rain on your parade  one last try what should i do break up with me or break up with you  so here i am noose around my neck and phone in hand the note is written the notes are read the choice is mine alive or dead i call you up say we need to talk i sigh and i sigh  as you come down the walk  ive made my choice no more will i lie ill end it now sigh after sigh  you talk me down i thank you for that i break your heart i pick up my coat and hat i leave you here crying those hateful tears i cant stop you now your fate is in your hands but finally, finally you understand that what youve done to guys so long is so very very wrong  my choice is made we're all alright i called you the next day and we talked all night   in case of emergency, pull handle all lyrics copywrite icoeph 2004, all rights reserved

      suddenly it seems to me that we are together but not emotionally this relationship isnt going to work in the back of my mind a demon lurks  life for me  isnt a picnic the ants come marching but no one gives a lick  we tried the counsellor we tried to let the other shine we tried to walk out the door and leave our problems far behind but it seems that no matter how hard we try we arent meant to be together ive found another her name is heather  life for me  is no picnic the ants come marching but no one gives a lick  forget the gifts burn them if you will this lifes the pits do you feel that chill? we cant keep on living this lie you know as well as i that we dont care for one another like we did last december  life for us  is no picnic the ants come marching and we dont give a lick  i know that youve been sneaking out to see those other guys i no longer have a doubt we wear our own diguise mask of deciet and cloak of lies gloves of truth and innocence this is a great disguise  life for them  is no picnic the ants come marching as they get sick  the inner child they talk about loves to rant and scream and shout i wish that i could let it out but i have to keep it in my life has taken and ugly route it seems that i have figured out just what this life is all about and i can never win  life for him is no picnic the ants come marching he runs away quick  clearly we just cant oppose all of our subconcious foes they are with us through the day and yet, try as had as we may they beat us in the end for the worst enemy is your friend  life for ants is a picnic they all come marching while we abandon ship   in case of emergency, pull handle all lyrics copywrite icoeph 2004, all rights reserved

      between the black silk sheets we lie together daring not to sleep and dream of fields of heather you gaze at me and say in soft tones i never want to be alone  it cant be helped it wont be solved these endless nights  within these walls  it goes on like this forever after silence never boken not even by laughter no one will ever hear our wondrous voices singing out our favorite song no one can hear us this silence is somehow wrong  it cant be helped it wont be solved these endless nights  within these walls  and so slowly i reach for you caressing, obsessing, undressing but we both know that this is wrong much to soon, should keep on waiting but it happens, all night long  it cant be helped it wont be solved these endless nights within these walls  the morning dawns we both regret we tell each other  not to fret for we are here and will always be within these walls is none  but we  it cant be helped it wont be solved these endless nights within these walls  we go our separate ways one day looking back as if to say im sorry that i ruined your life it was my fault your not my wife the terminal is flooded with a sea of faces different people different races  it cant be helped it cant be solved these endless nights  between these walls  i board the plane  leave you behind but despite it all your still on my mind i should have asked presented a ring but i wear a mask not angel wings  it cant be helped it cant be solved  endless nights have ended within these walls   in case of emergency, pull handle all lyrics copywrite icoeph 2004, all rights reserved

      as i look into the reversed peephole of apartment G23 i see a fine young beauty in eternal sleep she lies there on her king sized bed sleeping all alone suddenly her breasts heave heavily and she begins to moan  the darkness envelops me  im no longer here it doesn't matter anyways the eternal sleep is near  as i watch she levitates upwards as she cries her long fiery hair is flailing right before my eyes a massive light enters in and blinds me nearly i fear for the fine young beauty  in eternal sleep  the darkness envelops me  im no longer here it doesn't matter anyways the eternal sleep is near  i back away from the door and slam with all my might on the third try i am standing in the blinding light carefully i walk toward the fine young maiden fair and as i touch her face her eyes open rare  the darkness envelops me  im no longer here it doesn't matter anyways the eternal sleep is near  the light swiftly disappears shes lying next to me it seems as though  i awoke the beauty in G23 and as we embrace she tells me "here it comes you see now is the time for the eternal sleep"  the darkness envelops me  im no longer here it doesn't matter anyways the eternal sleep is near  the darkness envelops me  im no longer here it doesn't matter anyways the eternal sleep is near   in case of emergency, pull handle all lyrics copywrite icoeph 2004, all rights reserved

      somewhere among the twisted lives of many theres a man that lives a life of plenty but he cant find that one special girl cant find the one the one with fiery curls  shes out there i know she is shes out there but shes not his  she lives out there in NYC lives out there far away from he she seeks a man one that won't hurt her like so many before one that will provide but not spoil one that loves for more than looks one that loves her for she  hes out there  things are getting worse hes out there but hes not hers  they meet one day at grand CC eyes met in the light, so blissfully peace descended over the place lifelong wanderers meet, face to face but the silence is shattered a man with a bomb  stolls on in and detonates  everything is gone  they met one day they knew they were out there for each other but it was not meant to be the fates decided differently  life is odd  and sometimes ironic how could something happen something so supersonic how could something happen life is odd life is odd   in case of emergency, pull handle all lyrics copywrite icoeph 2004, all rights reserved

      hmm....wat to say.....well i broke up with the gf not that long ago and she is taking it way to hard.  seriously tho, threatening to kill herself.  i guess i should be worried but im not.  and that seems sort of odd considering who i am.  but the point is that i broke up with her so that i wouldnt hert her later.  i figured that if the chemistry is gone, its best to break it off as soon as possible.  apparently that isnt the case.  n e ways....god, i am so bored.  lol bored- Better Off Running Exposed, Disturbing.  lol.  well, at least its summer, and i dont have to do n e thing n e more.  well, if n e one has n e advice on the suicidal ex, itd be greatly appreciated.             im outta hurr.    and remember, in case of emergency, pull handle

      the colors make a stand they wont take it anymore they only have one demand but cant remember it anymore  red is angry as hell it cant take the bloodshed from the children in the dell orange cant find a reason for its anger but he sides with red abhored by gang danger  the colors make a stand they wont take it anymore they only have one demand but cant remember it anymore  yellow rages on about lemons and bees no one can understand him or understand what he sees green is just as envious as ever doesnt get enough recognition it uses envy as a lever to accomplish his mission  the colors make a stand they wont take it anymore they only have one demand but cant remember it anymore  blue just sits around and mopes sitting there, he looks so sad he has lost all hope indigo cant believe that all this is going on he just wants to go home and swim in his ocean-lawn  the colors make a stand they wont take it anymore they only have one demand but cant remember it anymore  last of all comes violet not the least bit violent but cant be bothered or concerned with things so trivial or be perterbed  the colors make a stand they wont take it anymore they only have one demand but cant remember it anymore   in case of emergency, pull handle all lyrics copywrite icoeph 2004, all rights reserved
