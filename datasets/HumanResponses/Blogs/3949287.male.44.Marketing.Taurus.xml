         Hello! Jim Cruz here.      Have you ever considered a Plan B?  You know what I'm talking about...a plan for something to fall back on in case your main source of income is gone. Or a Plan B is a secondary stream of income to use to become financially free of debt when Plan A falls miserably short of doing the job.    Let me share how I've come into my Plan B. &nbsp;It wasn't too long ago that my wife and I were in search of a good way to supplement our income. We felt that we should find a  proven  home-based business that could help us achieve more time and financial freedom in our lives. I was gasping for air...working 60 hours per week at my job. We didn't want hype or some risky "get-rich-quick" start-up operation. We were just looking to have our lives back with a reliable income-generating business that we would enjoy doing.     We worked several so-called "home-based" businesses, but none of them really turned out promising. Either the products/services were overpriced or they were the classic MLM programs where a very few people made any money and everyone else got burned. We lost money in every single one. But the concept of earning a "residual income" really appealed to us, so we kept on searching for the   RIGHT   opportunity.    We finally found a way to make an ongoing, long-term residual income!     Recently, a friend called us and shared information about the success he was having with this home-based business. He showed us a really different idea that was so simple, so refreshing, and it just made perfect sense. He told us about this company, it's successful track record, it's high quality products and services and the incredible customer loyalty -- people were purchasing every month at an incredible 95%+ re-order rate, month-after-month -- for years...  even if they weren't involved in it as a business  -   THAT  equates to a  SOLID ONGOING INCOME.  All this contributed to my friend's financial success along with many others on his team.     He also showed us that in this business, there's:      NO large investment    NO inventory    NO peddling products    NO pick-ups or deliveries    NO employees, overhead, or complicated paperwork    Enjoy income tax benefits    AND...NO financial risk!      We were still skeptical, but made an appointment to get all the details. We were extremely impressed! This was exactly what we've been looking for, so we made an educated decision.  We acted  FAST!      Needless to say, our decision to join this opportunity was the right choice. We are now earning a   SOLID GROWING INCOME.   It's definitely making a positive change in our lives and for many others as well.    The dynamics of working with a motivated team, saving happy customers, and a solid company with a superior product line and ethics has made all the difference in the world. This company has become home to us. If you're considering a Plan B, take a a look at our business - it just makes complete sense. It's made a wonderful difference in my family's lives and my wife, Toni and I have found it to be  THE   PERFECT   PLAN .
