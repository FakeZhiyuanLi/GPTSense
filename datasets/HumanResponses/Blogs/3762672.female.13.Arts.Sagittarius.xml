       Pull your arms up around your knees And hide out inside your room Pretend you can't feel at all  Just realize that I know how you feel now  If all I am is a distraction for you  then I can't complain that you can't feel something for me Take all you can, find in me  Can you think back to when things worked When dreams were the days you lived When you never cried alone  Just realize that I know how you feel now  If all I am is a distraction for you then I can't complain that you can't feel something for me Take all you can, find in me  I know how (know how) You feel now (you feel now)  If all I am is a distraction for you then I can't complain that you can't feel something for me Take all you can, find in me

      Man im feelnig real bad. Actually shit. I let 3 of my closest friends lost trust from me. I have betrayed then for a stupid game...i can't beleive myself. Im so seflish for all i know of. I mean my friends were leaving the game and i wanted them to stay, so i wont be lonley. Man if you guys are reading this, you guys mean alot to me. And doohee i know, if you think im bullshitting about me saying all of this. I understand why. But you know how should i know what to think. Im a dumbass , you guys can call me heartless if you want. But i do care. You may think now i dont even care, but i do. Its just that i wasnt thinkin straight you know, i was selfish at that time and u guys can admit that. leo was going to shut down the server, and everyone was complaining. Bad rumours about ure server how wuold i know if they were true or not.   But when asrim told me he was about to stay i felt lonley, then when u doohee left too, and moyga and everyone else, i felt so lonely. and yet i didnt want to beray leo so yeah...i understand. i know that i can't be friends with you like before. But i wish we still can, coz i still accpet u as who u were before. And i know ure thinkin twice about me now. I just wanted to say sorry. I know right now people hate me there but yeah i understand.   and lai if your readin this im so sorry about what i said before. I couldnt think straight of what i was doing. I was upset and lonley, i was confused,. And i understand if u dont want to be frinds with me. And i understand if you both 3 dont want to be friends with me at the same level. and doohee if you think im still bullshitting about this then i understand. and i know i did the wrong thing. I know your ways of suffering. And that is to lose your friendship forever. or maybe losing friendship with both of you three. I just wanted to say im sorry  and im sorry, hope we do get back all in ship shape. But i doubt it at this time at this state. Ill just wont ask for anything from you guys anymore, and i undertand if you can't trust me anymore. Becuase i know what i did was wrong.
