      Come on - if you like Reagan or not - let the man rest in peace and get off the opportunity to push a political agenda.   I use to love politics, but had to give it up because 1. I got so caught up in it - some of it to me is so black & white 2. It quit being a conversation and debate between the two parties.  It got personal and nasty.  But - after being reminded of Reagans style, belief in compromise, bringing the two groups together and optimism - then I can get back in the arena and still hold my values while keeping respect for the other side. Anyway - it got me to thinking of this prayer I heard for the first time on some PBS show Monday night -  Peace Prayer of St. Francis   I had never heard it before and was moved by the simplistic juxtaposition, yet how hard it is to put into action.  Ha - another jux - simple vs hard.  Anyway, here's the prayer.  Lord, make me an instrument of your peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy;  Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console, to be understood as to understand, to be loved as to love, for it is in giving that we receive, it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

      Family: (n) 1. people living together: a group of people living together and functioning as a single household, usually consisting of parents and their children 2. group of relatives: a group of people who are closely related by birth, marriage, or adoption ...    Family is the first place we learn about how to interact with each other and the world.  They are a blessing and a curse.  A weekend at the beach with family can sometimes make you go running, screaming alllll the way home. But this weekend was different.  Although there were times that I thought my head would explode from a smart mouth five year old and a chain-smoking Aunt, I actually left with realizations on family, love, and forgiveness.

       Headed down to Savannah to spend the weekend with my cousin, whose husband was shipped to Iraq two weeks ago, her two girls, my Aunt & my Mother.  Family ties should be honored.  Oh well, more time to work on my skin cancer...

       urlLink  No lights are needed outside with the bright full moon shining.  The crazy things people do when the pull of a full moon is in force.  It's said that crime goes up and babies are born more frequently during this time.  I can understand that babies would be MADE more frequently! No chance of that here - which leads me to my musing...    Growing up and in my earlier adult years, I did not have a sweet tooth, but in the recent past, I have really started craving chocolate.  Not quite a chocoholic, but enough to make me stop on the way home tonight from dinner with Jim to buy a big ole bar of semi-sweet dark chocolate.  This impulsiveness got me to wondering - is it true that the pleasure of eating chocolate is registered in the same part of our brain as sex??  Do people really eat chocolate as a substitute (albiet, a very poor substitute) for sex? I started thinking back that at the time I started really craving chocolate is the same time I did not have a steady love interest.  hmmm...    I'm going outside to finish off my bar of chocolate by the light of the full moon.
