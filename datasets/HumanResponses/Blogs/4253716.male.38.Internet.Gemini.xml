      If there was every anyone I would love to see get their ass kicked on national TV, it would be Paris Hilton. I mean plenty of people have been famous for no reason, but my lord she takes the cake.  To make matters worse, I just went to CNN to see what was happening in the real world and I read  urlLink this!   Yes, I can't imagine why so many people hate Americans. Anyone know if their are jobs in New Zealand, is Peter Jackson making another LOTR flick, maybe I can dress as an Orc.

      Over the last two weeks if your into computer (console) sports games you know it has been football week. Yeah I know it is fricking August, but it is football season for the fat ass joystick jocks.  I was immediately wowed by Sega, then I was even more impressed with Madden. Of course on the boards I frequent like  urlLink DSP  and  urlLink Operation Sports  debates sprung up like strippers at my uncles house in 87 (don't ask). I now find myself in daily arguments with people who claim to be unbiased but (get this) prefer game A.  I've been called a Madden fanboy, and ESPN ass-hat and my personal favorite a whinny dick. See I have an addiction, I have to argue with people who claim to be unbiased, but really aren't. There are whole boards full of them.  They proudly thump their chests and say "We don't use words like fanboy here! Because we are gamers" To that I say bloody bullshit!   These guys jump all over anyone who post anything negative about their game of choice, but will happily allow "the other games" threads to be opened, which of course slam "the other game" and it is no problem. In fact they will use their passive - aggressive arguments like "I think both games are great, and by the way here are 12 reason why Madden sucks!" To join in on the fun.  Yet they are not alone, go to a place like  urlLink MaddenMania  and get the exact same treatment if you slam Madden. But at least these guys aren't trying to hide the fact they are biased, I mean it is called MaddenMania.  So next time you see a post that says I'm a gamer and not loyal to any product, tell them to go screw!

      I stopped by DQ today on the way back from lunch, and I decided to give the new Brownie Batter Blizzard a whirl. My friends I advise you to stay away from this mound of brown pleasure at all costs.  I think someone must have slipped some kind of drug inside of this thing. Every bite made me feel like that blonde no-name chick in the Matrix 2 (Reloade, Revolutions whatever it was called). It was as if the DQ women was the weird sounding guy from the Matrix giving me a virtual wet spot in my pants with each bite.  Problem is after I was done I felt I needed more, so there must be something to my drug theory, or else I'm just an ice cream whore. So do yourself a favor, go for something plain like the Oreo blizzard and stay away from this mocha blast of excitement!

      Hell....why not I thought. Everyone else is doing it so why don't I share my unique view with the world. It's going to be mostly about Sports, Gaming, Movies and Women. So stay tuned if that is your thing.
