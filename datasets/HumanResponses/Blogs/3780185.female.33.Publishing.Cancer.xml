      I'm expecting an influx of people this week.  Privacy, peace and quiet are going to be at a premium.  In 7 minutes, my sister and her boyfriend land at LaGuardia.  My mom and grandmother came on Sunday.  Thankfully, mom and gram are not staying with me, but my sister and David are.  On Friday my cousin and his girlfriend come to visit and they are also staying with me.  Our little, tiny apartment is going to be very crowded. My poor husband.  SO, needless to say, I may not be writing as much as I would like.  What a horrible way to start a blog!!   I finished a book the other day that looks like it is going to be a huge hit.  I got an advanced copy of  urlLink Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell .  It was great.  Very well written.  It's a Victorian novel and has the feel of the real thing.  If you are used to reading the Harry Potter books, it may drag a bit in parts, but for those of you who appreciate good writing, it will suit you just fine.  It is the story of two magicians and how they bring magic back to England.  The whole book is good, but the last 100 pages are amazing.  Definately work the time (it's a pretty hefty book) and a must read for those cold winter months...just don't forget the tea!

      So...yeah, I'm reading the Clinton book.  While I'm reading it, I can't help but think that he's trying to convince me of something.  Everyone is just about as good as he or she can be.  Even his step-father who beat his mother and SHOT at them!!  He didn't really mean to hit them...he would have never forgiven himself if he did...he's really a good guy.  Dude!  Really?  Because if my father had shot at us, I think we would have thought some bad things about him.  Just a few.  Even the kids who gave him shit at school are somehow good underneath it all.  I just get the feeling that it's all so contrived.   The following are the books that I have purchased and have not had a chance to read, so I am hiding them from my husband so that he doesn't know how much money I spend on books:  urlLink The Best American Non Required Reading   urlLink The Closing of the Western Mind   urlLink The Queen's Man  Actually, wow...that's not as bad as I thought.  Only 3 books in my to-read pile.

      I must have the most boring job in the world.  I created this blog so that I would actually have something to do at work besides spend my day reading everyone else's blogs.  So, here I am, at work and bored bored bored.  Right now, I'm finishing the third book in the His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman,  urlLink The Amber Spyglass .  It's very well written, a great story but very dark.  I can't believe that these books are for kids!  Some parts of it, particularly the parts regarding Mary, remind me of Mary Doria Russel's book  urlLink The Sparrow .  I found that book disturbing for some reason and I can't quite put my finger on it.   I'm also reading Bill Clinton's book.  I know, I know, the hype.  I'm ashamed to say that I got the book on the first day, but proud to say that I didn't wait in line for it.  So far, it reads like a novel or a book of short stories.  He just rambles on and on with stories from his childhood.  It's interesting.  I'm reading it thinking, what makes someone want to be president?  I always thought it was about power...and it probably is.  But, he was just a kid with a crappy childhood.  Lots of kids have crappy childhoods and don't want to become president.  I haven't gotten very far yet, so maybe he explains it later on.

      I interviewed for another job yesterday.  It’s in my company, but in a different department.  I’m really trying not to get my hopes up, but I am thinking about it all the time.  It has replaced quitting smoking in the area in my brain dedicated to obsessive thoughts. Well, not replaced, but shoved over.  I still obsess about both of them…and I haven’t even quit smoking yet.   This medicine that I’m taking to quit, Zyban, is keeping me up at night.  It’s used as an anti-depressant, so I’ve been in a great mood the last couple of days, but I’m up until 1:30 AM.  Then I wake up, without any problem, at like 7:30 AM.  That is not like me.  That goes against everything I have ever believed about sleep.  I’m a sleeper.  It’s part of what makes me who I am.  It’s the thing that my college friends tease me about.  It’s the thing my husband says at dinner parties.  I suppose it’s good, especially if I’m not tired, to have more waking hours to get things done.  But I can’t help feeling that it will eventually catch up with me.  If my body needs 9 hours sleep a night, I need to get it, right? So now, ahead of me, I have a weekend of staying up late thinking about the job and how I'm going to quit smoking.  It should be great!

      I set at date to quit smoking.  It seems like I shouldn’t have a problem with it.  I only smoke about 8-10 cigarettes a day, but the problem is that I don’t really want to quit.  Oh, a big part of me does, but there is a significant part of me that still LOVES it.  But, it’s horrible for me and I keep having these mini panic attacks about cancer.  So, I’m going to list here the reasons I want to quit.   1.	My husband keeps asking me to quit and I know he does it because he loves me.  He keeps saying that he wants to live a long life with me and not have me die early because of cigarettes. 2.	Cancer and other horrible, disgusting diseases.  3.	It makes me smell bad. 4.	In NY, you can’t smoke inside any building.  Not even in bars.  That makes smokers outcasts, having to go huddle outside bars and restaurants.  I don’t want to be one of those people.  5.	Although I’m the kind of person who needs “alone” time, I tend to put myself in situations where I get more alone time than I need so that I can smoke without anyone giving me crap about it. 6.	My family doesn’t know I smoke and it would break their hearts if they knew I did. 7.	None of my friends smoke.   8.	I have noticed that I’ve been short of breath lately.  I don’t want to be like that…I’m still young.  And if I feel this way from only smoking ½ a pack a day or less, imagine what it’s like for the people who smoke twice, even three times that! 9.	It will piss my boss off if I quit smoking because she smokes and wants a buddy to go downstairs with her.   10.	I want to have a baby in the next couple of years, so I’m going to have to quit anyway.  Better to get all that shit out of my system now.   So, those are my reasons.  They are pretty good ones.  I just hope that they hold up in the face of a massive cig craving.  I’m all set, I bought the gum.  I went to the doctor and got a prescription for Zyban.  Now, in 5 days, I’m going to start.  Man, I hope I can do it.

      Vanity Fair is one of the best magazines around.  Of course, if I were a conservative, I wouldn't feel that way, but hating George W. with a passion (like the editor, Graydon Carter), it really speaks to me!  Actually, I've been reading it for a very long time.  In high school, my mom got me a subscription and I have had one ever since (going on 15 years!).  In the July issue, there is an article about the Bush women that is fascinating!  Laura Bush comes out looking like a saint, but the other women in George W’s life sound like a bunch of bitches.  Well, on second thought, his daughters sound like wild children, but not horrible people.  Did you know that Laura Bush ran a stop sign when she was a teenager and ended up killing one of her high school classmates?  That will seriously mess someone up!  The article, written by James Wolcott, is incredibly biased and he makes more than one cheap pot-shot at the Bushes.  But, sad as it may seem, reading an article that is biased, and happens to be something that you agree with, is great.  Not that I think any of it is untrue.  It all seems very well documented and know for a fact that Graydon Carter is a stickler for fact-checking.  One has to be incredibly meticulous to be able to publish something so one-sided.

      I finally gave up on the Clinton book.  Not that I've had much time to read it lately.  Everyone has gone and we have the house to ourselves again.  But, with time to read again, I found myself dreading picking up that book.  Not only is it very heavy and difficult to balance on one's stomach, but the content leaves MUCH to be desired.  The more I read and the closer I got to him becoming president, the more I realize that he's not going to say anything juicy.  I've seen tons of the interviews he did promoting this book.  If there was anything good in the book, they would have asked him about it during one of the interviews.  So, now that I've come to terms with not finishing it (a huge step for me), what do I do with the book?  Do I keep it on the shelf?  If I do that, someone might ask me about it and I would be tempted to lie and say I finished it.  Or do I return it?  Will B&N take it back?  I've had it for a few weeks.  But, I keep all of the receipts for books in the book itself.  (I like doing that so that when I go back and read some of them, I can remember where and when I bought them.  Kinda geeky, huh?) Eh, who am I kidding?  I'll probably take it back...that way I can get another book! So...now that I gave up on Clinton, I started reading a book called Shantaram.  It's by this guy from Australia who had escaped from jail and went to India.  While in India, he gets involved in organized crime there and is eventually picked up again and sent back to Australia.  It's technically a novel, but these things actually happened to the author (Gregory David Roberts).  So, much like reading Dave Eggers’ second book ( urlLink You Shall Know Our Velocity ), I find it difficult separate the author from the character.  I don’t even know if Roberts wants his readers to try.  Anyway, it’s not coming out in the US until October, but you can get copies of the UK edition fairly cheap on  urlLink Ebay .  It’s well written, but somewhat cheesy in parts.  The main character is constantly sizing people up by looking into their eyes.  He knows he can trust someone by the look in their eyes.  I don’t know a lot about organized crime and how to trust someone on the streets of Bombay, but I would tend to think that if someone were a really good con artist, they would be able to fake that look in the eye.  Also, I would also think that it wouldn’t work in every situation.  I guess I’m not a firm believer in the whole “windows to the soul” thing.  Anyway, besides that, the book is damn good.

      I've stopped actually trying to read the Clinton book from cover to cover.  Now I'm skipping paragraphs, pages, chapters, whatever.  It totally goes against my nature and on some level I'm really bothered by it.  However, not too bothered.  The book rambles on and on and on.  I am sick of hearing about every, single person he has ever met.  At first, it was kind of interesting.  But now, I (like most readers of this book, I'm sure) just want to get to the  good  part.  And by good part, I mean race for president, of course!
