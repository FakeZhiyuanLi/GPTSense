      I never thought summer was something romantic to look forward to, much like one would a breath of fresh air. Its so easy to brush aside the little gnawing trickle of sweat down our brow and the emission of heat from our body. The slumber of winter totally vanished when you breathe and live in the heat and humidity. Our body goes through the motion, like the start of a cold engine. When faced with the heat of summer, I think not what I feel, but how I am living, my heat the very proof of my existence.

       urlLink    Oh India!  You can smell the strong aroma of curries from this small diner, tugged in one corner, with its display of onions, garlic and sweet potato. This reminded me of a grocery shop in The Hague, where fruits and vegetables were put out, and even in the evenings you will find them fresh. I sniff my way into the diner, though apart from curries I know not what they have to offer. A quick glance at the menu and some finger pointing and guessing later, my beef curry was served. It does not look done up the way you would expect from a typical Japanese curry house. The beef did not come in symmetrical bite sizes and the gravy is not laden with starch. For authenticity, you can even pick on the curry leaves. It was a welcome diversion and my nose proved its worth today. Whilst the curry does not look visually appealing, it is more than compensated by taste and eye candy complimentary of the three petite chefs.

       urlLink    Inokashira Park  This is the infamous Inokashira Park frequented by Haruki's Sputnik Sweetheart. There were ducks and fishes swimming near the bridge, eager to make a swoop for your crumbs. At the far end are boats powered by foot paddles. The trail to the park is lined with quaint little shops and eateries. The heat of the impending summer has lured everyone indoors, with the occasional odd creature oblivious to it. Walking along this narrow street, one would imagine being in a small town in a remote part of Europe, where the locals live a blissfully quiet life.

      "We are going to show you how to handle the emergency ladder. Date: June 26th (Sat) 10am - 11am. Room No. 203". Ishiida-san is one kind lady who would leave little notes in English for me. She is married to an unassuming quiet man who would potter around his little garden at the backyard. I once had tea at their place, and she would be the docile wife serving delicious English tea and pastries while Ishiida-san would ponder over my papers. It was the first time I truly appreciate English tea with Japanese hospitality. Months later, Isiida-san knocked on my door, and offered me rice with soft peanuts, meant to be customary in celebration of her grandson having turned seven. He was behind her, in traditional Japanese garb, albeit a miniature one, like a doll.

      We all have our baggages. One such baggage is coin baggage. You never seem to be able to shake it off. One moment you feel you are rid of it, the next moment they come crawling back. I managed to shake off my eight months' worth of coin baggage today, finally. How big is yours?

       urlLink    Lockers carry with it something symbolic of college life. At least thats how I see it. What it carries now is a whole load of possibilities. More likely than not, I would walk past these lockers and wonder when one of them would explode. It is so easy to dump something in it and wait a day before activating it. I recalled someone telling me that trash cans at train stations were removed due to the Aomshinryuku subway attacks. We are creatures of habit and circumstances. Live and let live.

      Have you wondered who came out with statistics on how many people visited which place and who are these people who came to that place? They are counters, real people holding counters who diligently click when a person, a car, a dog or whoever they had been tasked to count. I never believed in those numbers as they can be fabricated, not by act of malice but by force of nature.

      I am Midori of seventy six and seventy seven. Love is defined in many ways, one of torturer and one of the tortured. I am both, in that order. Live's unhappiness does not come altogether. That's why they say 'life has its ups and downs' and not 'life has its downs and downs'. Life's little up is the nice bowl of white grained rice, picked by chopsticks without splinters and fish whose bones do not choke you.   What are the chances of one coughing out blood and dying on the spot? One in one, one might hope, but fat hope. It does not come in such a neat package. You would need to first cough out enough blood, go for checkups, being pricked with numerous needles, go through numerous operations and down doses of awful tasting drugs and to be told to rest at home and wait. You would wait and wait and still you would not die. This is life's little down, at least for the one hopeful of the simple outcome. In the process, I might choose to strangle someone first, just for the thrill.

       I managed to catch two episodes of Designer Guys when I was home recently.&nbsp;It brought back fond memories of days when I was just bumming around meddling with silkscreen paintings and going for my driving lessons. Each morning would be greeted with a series of programmes, ranging from Name the Price, Jamie Oliver The Naked Chef, Designer Guys and the very soapy and draggy Days of Our Lives.  &nbsp;  Sometimes we remember things from its association with TV programmes. Seeing Steven and Chris bicker about what fabrics to use and how Chris would always be lying around doing nothing makes me laugh. On the surface, it appeared that nothing has changed. But you will discover otherwise&nbsp;if you scratch deeper. Even Bo from Days of Our Lives has cut his hair short and removed his ugly beard.  &nbsp;  I remember not too long ago, less than a year perhaps, I would be running the treadmill and riding the stationary bike in California gym, watching the clock tick and my pounds drop. My aim then was to run away, to escape and build my life anew elsewhere. Never in my dream did I imagine finding love again. Now,&nbsp;months later, and three trips home, I feel I had been blessed with love from a very pure soul. One where giving is as natural as water flowing from the poles. I feel blessed. Did I just repeat myself?

      I saw a snippet of the female Tamil tigers training on this morning's BBC news. They did not wear shoes when they were doing their drills, and they were manning the artillery. The sight was one of liberation for women, but also to show that desperate times call for desperate measures. To deploy women on the battlefield, once a taboo practice, seems natural and normal for the Tamil tigers. This is not the first time I have heard of this group of Tamil militant fighters in Sri Lanka but the news today prompted me to read more about them, what they represent and the cause they are fighting for. I will leave it to you to form your own opinion on the right or wrong of their actions. But the next time you put that juicy Sri Lankan black pepper crab in your mouth, think of the country that produced them and how those crabs have lived.

      Every night on my way home, I would pass by the Zhong Hua Dong Xiu Chinese eatery. For the last one week, I did not see Sha Mei in the shop. I was a little sad, thinking that she has either quit or has been assigned to another location. She does not cook very well but she has a sweet voice and a kind smile. Dumas once asked me what I see in her? I think I like her sha sha look and her simple ways.  Today as I was walking along the same path home, I peered into the shop and I saw this bubbly girl in a brown stripe polo shirt, hair tied into two ponytail, with the same sha sha smile on her face. Its Sha Mei! I was so happy to see her. She did not quit afterall. Perhaps she took a summer break. But I am glad she is back. And I know that seeing her would comfort me when I come back from home in two weeks' time...

      My colleague gave me a rice cake wrapped in bamboo leaf today, saying that its for celebration of the Star Festival, which falls on the seventh day of the seventh month. It goes back to a legend that two stars, Altair (the cowherd star) and Vega (the weaver star), who are lovers and are allowed to meet only once a year.   I wonder how many lovers are leading the life of the cowherd and his maiden, yearning and longing for that brief cosmic connection, only to be separated again.

      One of the things I enjoyed doing in the midst of drowning in work is to fiddle with financial calculators, the type where you could punch in a few numbers and voila! in a few seconds, your net worth in 10, 20, 30 years will flash before you. Of course, a calculator is merely a calculator, its the fighting not to drown that makes a difference. Once the numbers flashed before me, immediately my mind would be transported to the near future, sitting under the parasol, sipping my iced lemonade, reading a trashy brain dead novel while the sweet aroma of barbeque seafood floats in the background, the white sandy beaches and the clear sea water beckons me...knock knock stop dreaming...

      When was the last time you did something and regret later? Or when was the last time you did not do something and regret later? We all have our moments. I lived my life being on the safe side, pondering, pussyfooting and finally rotting away, wondering...  Everyone of us has a disease named procrastination. Some have a malignant one, some have it like one would the occasional headache, while others do not think they have it.  In my days of psychosis, I belong to the last category. I have dreams of grand things, of creating something from white empty spaces, of penning my thoughts, of immortalizing myself, no matter how insignificant it may be. So I took one small step yesterday by starting on my painting journey again, one puny step at a time.   I felt totally transformed and full of energy, I felt alive. I worked at it like it was deep meditation, like a dry well filled with water for the first time. The minor flaws of the painting did not deter me. Its mirrors life, where flaws are mingled with near perfection. Even after Dumas has gone to sleep, I still felt energized but unwilling to let it go. It manifested into a dream, or a dreamlike state where the heart tugs and the tears roll, of bliss, peace and absolute calmness and kindness.

      I always eat at this run down Chinese restaurant by the corner of Shibuya, just behind the Shibuya police station. Their gyoza is one of the better ones I have tasted. Not too oily, not too rich, with the right amount of vegetables and meat that does not carry a porky taste and does not give one any chives aftertaste the way Beijing dumplings do. The helper will always ask for my order and I will answer with the same reply each time, "gyoza two, cola one", with my fingers showing two and one in case they could not understand me. Everything about this restaurant is very Chinese, the only baffling thing is that the helpers always speak Japanese. Maybe being a Chinese in a foreign land, I am always on the lookout for someone who speaks my language.   Today, there was a new helper and she got my order wrong. Instead of two servings of gyoza, she only got me one. Maybe my finger was not getting to her. The usual helper was nowhere to be seen. Suddenly she came back to the restaurant with a bagful of shopping, explaining to the chef what she had bought. The new helper is now pulling the seasoned helper aside, and started asking her, in what seemed like hushed tones of Mandarin, something about orders. It then dawned on me that my months of speculation finally found its answer.   The helper in the restaurant speaks and understands Chinese. What I could not understand is the unwillingness to acknowledge that, in spite of me having spoken Mandarin on a few occasions in that restaurant with some visiting friends. Is there an unwillingness in some of us to acknowledge our origins? Or is it that some would prefer to assimilate flawlessly into their environment, with the hope that part of what they are could be diminised over time? I had thought about forcing it upon the helper with my next order, in Mandarin, and watching her reaction. But what right do I have to do that to someone who do not wished it to be done? The best I could do now is to accept that to each his own, and I should respect that.

      So good its Friday! With the Ding Shang-ben series in the background (for those interested, he is currently being tried for murder), I decided to sit here and ramble about something, anything. Two days ago, I had a Macdonald's cheeseburger for lunch. I savoured the taste of cheese and beef patties and an added slice of bacon. I remembered the first time I tasted cheese when I was ten. I did not like the taste of foul milk and vomit. Thats what I thought cheese tasted like. And I wondered why anyone would eat something so disgusting.   I am digressing now as I am utterly disgusted at how everyone repeats the same lines..."Ding Shang-ben is a good man...he saved so and so...he did good..." Such old and repetitive script, like 'frying cold rice'.  Back to cheese. People in the old days (days before the refrigerator was invented) must have stinch and scrimp to make sure they have enough food for the family. So I would not be surprised if they kept their milk for days, even after it had turned bad. They soon develop an acquired taste and a strong stomach for bad milk . So over the years, it became a delicacy, even the moderate and rich families were thinking of ways to make their milk bad. Of course, the taste is milder than the poor, who seemed to get it right effortlessly. Now you can find cheese everywhere, even battered in flour and served as an appetizer.  That's just some nonsense I made up. If you are really keen to know the real story, just type 'history of cheese' under any search engine and you can find heaps of literature on it. Happy reading!

      I think I have experienced it just when I was writing the version of reality, but this was supposed to be the earlier version that had been erased by the system or maybe it was already posted in my blog in another reality. It just wont appear here but it has been written.

      I was standing in the train looking at the people around me, looking at them through my eyes, the sockets that hold my eyeballs, seeing the side of my nose and how they are merely spectators, not participating in my reality. They are outside of my experience, not feeling what I was feeling or seeing what I was seeing, from this personal view I call my own. I imagined myself leaping off the train, what physical pain it would cause me, and how these people would never see the leaping from my view, how they would never be in my skin, feeling that pain if there was pain, or experiencing the motion of it all. My reality is only privy to me and no one else. My reality prevails when my eyes are open, seeing, feeling or just being. When would my reality shut down I asked myself? My thoughts immediately went to that state of semi consciousness when we actually sleep. We halt our reality as we sleep and let it take us somewhere else. Would we move into another reality when we are sleeping? Would we take on another reality, one where we are no longer who we think we are?  We could be still in the same flesh, seeing things from the side of our eyes, through the same eyeballs but the consciousness might be something else? Is this called another sphere, dimension, space or black hole? Would it therefore exist another one of us with a different reality altogether, different life, different daily existence in which we seamlessly live without wondering about the other? Would we, in that reality, see us as mere spectators not privy to what they feel in the other reality? And when we wake up we assume the same reality as that before we slept and called it sleep when in actuality we merely moved into this state, bringing with it a continuum of states we called memories? Maybe each waking day is a different state of reality we do not see as different but merely a continuation but in the truest reality it is a different state? There could another one of us or many of us, assimilating different realities right at this moment that we cannot see nor ever have the power to cross over? Maybe schizophrenia is that state where some might cross but because it does not appear like its possible it becomes a sickness by our definition? I am not using this as the easy solution or answer but who is to say it might not be a real reality and that schizophrenia, or another scientific non sickness driven term could mean the same thing, the ability to cross spheres, space, dimensions or into that black hole momentarily together with our current state but leaving little traces of our ever been there? Would you sleep tonight and wake up tomorrow feeling that nothing has changed but in actuality it has, even our state of consciousness might be fooled, that what we see as a continuum is in reality not so?

      I stared at the book lying patiently on the woolly rug. The name Waiting feels so apt for this moment. Ha Jin's Waiting is the current novel that I am unwinding with every night before I sleep. It talks about how a man, after being married for eighteen years, decides to return to his hometown again to divorce his wife so that he can be with the woman he has loved all those years when he was married. Immediately one might conjure up images of a pair of adulterous and immoral beings thinking only about their own selfish desires. But somehow this is not how it was with this story. The two lovers, if they may be so called based on our modern definition of lovers, are not practicing lovers in the real sense. They led a life of abstinence, driven by their love for each other. I have not finished the story, so I would not know how this story would unfold eventually. Or perhaps its my unwillingness to know how this tragically romantic love story would end that kept it waiting.  Sometimes life is one big mystery. Everyday can be lived with hope or with despair. We can see ourselves closer to reaching nirvana (if death can be treated as such) or closer to another life (if we believe in reincarnation) or simply closer to the end of our journey (if you want an ending to everything). I would probably not choose the latter. Moral judgements aside, I'd rather live a life of love and uncertainty, to be overwhelmed each day with overflowing love and insatiable desire to feel love and give love. There is always something poignant about forbidden love, made more bittersweet by the purity of it.

      I had a good session at the gym today. This is the first time in a long while that I did 80 minutes of cardio. It felt like pay back time. I probably appeared like I was struggling with the triceps machine as this chubby personal trainer came over to help me position my arms for maximum impact. I always have problem with my triceps and my abs. I can lose alot of weight at my thighs, butt, shoulders and arms but somehow I just could not get a perfect set of abs.  I went to eat at Chong Hua Dong Xiu today, which is Sha Mei's restaurant. Dumas said I am stalking her by secretly snapping a picture of her. I didn't think so.  When I came home and after a nice cold shower, I saw that fruit flies were breeding rampantly near my rubbish bin area. To my horror, eggs were everywhere on top of tightly sealed bags. It was a fearful sight, one that gave Dumas the goose bumps just hearing it. I did a massive cleaning and now the eggs are disposed. I hope they can make it safely to the incinerator before hatching.  I am sure my neighbours are facing the same summer dilemma, where insects breed just before the approaching autumn.
