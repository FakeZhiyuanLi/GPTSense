      Yo, We at war We at war with terrorism, racism, and most of all we at war with ourselves (Jesus Walks) God show me the way because the Devil's trying to break me down (Jesus Walks with me) with me with me with me [fades]  You know what the Midwest is? Young & Restless Where restless n***** might snatch your necklace And next these n***** might jack your Lexus Somebody tell these n***** who Kanye West is I walk through the valley of Chi where death is Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh! Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard hard Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us Saying "we eat pieces of $#!t like you for breakfast" Huh? Yall eat pieces of $#!t? What's the basis? We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases A trunk full of c*** rental car from Avis My momma used to say only Jesus can save us Well momma I know I act a fool But I'll be gone til November I got packs to move I Hope  [Hook x2] (Jesus Walks) God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down (Jesus Walks with me) The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now (Jesus Walks) And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs (Jesus Walks with me) I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long  To the hustlas, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly I know he hear me when my feet get weary Cuz we're the almost nearly extinct We rappers are role models we rap we don't think I ain't here to argue about his facial features Or here to convert atheists into believers I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way yall need Jesus So here go my single dog radio needs this They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh? Well let this take away from my spins Which will probably take away from my ends Then I hope this take away from my sins And bring the day that I'm dreaming about Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out  (Jesus Walks) God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down (Jesus Walks) The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now

      OH YEAH!!  EXAMS ARE DONE ! This rocks. Now there's only one day left of school on Monday, then no school on Tuesday, and then we pick up our report cards on Wednesday! w00t!  The Science exam was SO much easier than I expected. It was great.  Guess what? Jessie was just over today and Jackie had Marinda and Black over. -.-; They were acting evil, so Jessie and I locked them out when they went to my old school. Then when they got in Jackie was  SOOOOO SOO SO SO  p!$$ed. O.o But Jessie and I were doing my nails the whole time they tried to get in and so it was funny.  I got fake nails and dey're purdy. That's 'cause Jessie and I went to McDonald's and got other stuff at Meadowlark Mall after. I got a preety purse and lip gloss, and Jessie got eyeliner. I got a toy from my Happy Meal, it's so awesome.  I've got another Cities soccer game today! Hopefully I won't tie like we did last night. >.  So I've got to go because these nails are impairing my typing, it's din-din, and I have to get ready to the socc-air!

       Hello.  I'm Rachel! My site died and I'm too lazy to make a new one, so I got a blog site. Yay. I'll most likely use this for the rest of the summer an' stuff. And then I can make a layout for it too. w00t.   You know what I hate?  Final exams.  They're scary. Our teachers make us take them all in one week and it's poop. I had my Math exam today, which was amazingly easy, but I was soooo scareded of it. I HATE EXAMS. I mean I have to study for the stoopid things. ;_; I've been studying since, like, 2 pm.  IT'S SO BORING !!! I think I'm prepared, though. Condensed study notes, all the way!  Meh. I hate how I'm also extremely busy this week. I have soccer Thursday, Friday, twice Saturday, and Sunday. WHY OH WHY! I can't wait for summer. It's so close yet so far away. The first day of summer, I plan to get a slurpie and watch TeeVee the whole entire day. :D  Anyways, I think I'd better clean up a tad... My room's so messy 'cause I brought all my stoof home on Monday. I'll just like make my bed or whatever. Toodlesness.
