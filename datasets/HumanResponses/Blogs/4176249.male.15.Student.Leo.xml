      I was wishing for a brighter day, but only recieved the darkness. I was wishing for the rain to end, but only recieved a stronger storm. How is it that we so often forget what's *really* important to us? I feel that this is somehow becuase of the lack of emotion we are to show everyday. Every breathing moment, are we expected to mask our love? Our hearts, will they always be expected to be caged? How does one get away from one's emotions, when that person is one, raw, flowing emotion? And further more, how does one protect something small and delicate like a violet, while they are stranded deep inside of the icy grip of winter? How... A question that holds more meaning then almost any other three letter word in the english language. The question, which will reveal the answers in one's heart, is only a reflection of some truth, that has yet to be concluded. While this is only a theory, the answer still remains to be revealed... And yet the tears of one's heart can be dried, only by the unknowing of this fact. You can breathe, only becuase it is something that you can do. And we feel, only becuase it is an impulse created by nerves throughout the body, and the soul. When one shining light, that reigned for so long, burns out, *that* is the the answer. And it should be grasped, for long enough to end the eternal silence, that is pain itself.....

      I was thinking to myself today, is it logical to think that we might all be someone who was in existance over one-thousand, possibly two-thousand years ago? I think that this can go many ways. I *do* believe however, that this is truthful. As I mentioned before, our will to love, and to to survive, is an energy that keeps us as we are now, and in this form. After we die, this energy is combined into something known as a spirit, and waits for it's own time to reattach itself to this world of the physical once again. When this happens, all that is needed, is a form of life. This form of life can be anything. A tree, an insect, or even the air we breathe. All these are the most likely selections for the spirit, because most spirits are not powerful enough to become an embodiment. The only way to become a human once again, is to lay dorment inside of the early stages of a human child, at the exact moment that a soul would be selected to rest inside of it. However, this requires a powerful, and very wise soul. Once this is done, the child is born, and they grow into an adult. One of my very best friends was talking about people becoming elementals, meaning they obtain the power of one of the seven elements. These Elements are known as Air, Water, Home, Fire, Soul, Story and Sound. I believe this may very well be that best way to go about this. One might obtain an element, by being the reincarnation of a very powerful and wise spirit, whose life was lost to one of the elements. As such, a person who dies in a plane crash, might be bound to the skies as a spirit. If they are a weaker spirit, they might become an eagle, or a falcon. But if the soul is stronger, they might actually become the wind itself, creating jetstreams in the vast and endless skies in their own honor, until it is time to become a human child once again. This child would then become very in tune with the element of wind, and would make the best of pilots, or perhaps a great astronomer. On another note, someone whose life was lost to a terrible lie, or took a beautiful story to the grave with them, might be reincarnated into a beautiful wirter, or perhaps a famous inventor, as a Story elemental. You see? Anyone or anything around you could be the reincarnate form of someone who was lost to this world long ago, or even yesterday, and has returned to the world of the living once again, to claim a spot in life for themselves.....

      I feel really blessed, and too lucky to have all of the freinds I have. I feel so special to be able to talk to someone about anything and eveything at all. I know it sounds totally corny, but it's the whole truth. My friends are most likely one of the only things that keeps my world turning during the day. They know just what I like, what I feel, and what I need to hear when I need to hear it. Whe you stop and think about it, in an entire universe that doesn't know you even exist, a small group of people can change your life, soften your heart, and bring down the walls that surround it. The only thing better than having friends, is spending time with them. Any kind of time at all, is the best time you'll ever have, even if you don't realize it. Trust me, I used to overlook it all the time. But still, no matter what the world handed me, I had them, even when they didn't have me... It makes me very proud to know that love can be shared in the world of the physical, in the world of cyber space. We've come so far on our journey to obtain information as a race. Starting with nothing at all, we picked up the peices of what was right in front of us, and put it together. That fact alone, is breathtaking, and interesting. In a world of dull lights and empty hearts, one person can change your life for eternity, and beyond that. To think that something so delicate such as life, is actually controlled by one, flowing energy source which we all share, and we all connect with. Our will to love and survive, is that energy.....
