      I sent out my final batch of e-mails for the main page admins. I know... you LS members want to praticipate too ^_^ but I haven't got the messageboard up yet. I'm working on that. Since this is low cost operation, I'm going to look for a free message board.

      I managed to make 65k in profits on harvesting! It would have been around 100k+, but I decided to get harvesting gear, which honestly... isnt' really as good as expected, I just harvest less  urlLink Marjoram . I haven't been pulling as much mugwart, but honestly I'm not harvesting as much as I was on Saturday and Sunday.

      I really would like to see this LS grow. If you have friends, or just see good people with potential (friendly, likes to level together, do quest, etc.) let the sac holders know. =)     As long as they aren't a pain and only come on to ask for things.       ------------------------------------------------------    Rank 4 and 5: For those who were not able to do it last weekend. This is your chance! ^^  Just have Rank 3 done, and we can give you directions from there. This does take a lot of time, so if just want to tag along for 4 that is fine also.

      Ok here is the current information all over FFXI forums:   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 turn in gets you the normal Yukata.   4 more turn ins gets you the Lord/Lady's Yukata (HQ)   For every turn in after that (you can only turn in 1) you get normal items like Summer Fans (a firework( and Chocobo Tickets.   After turning in the items for the two Yukatas I had 3 left. (I tried turning in 8, and then 7, it would only take 1 at a time).   1st Item got Onoko Yukata  2nd - 5th got Lord's Yukata  6th got 15 Summer Fans  7th got 16 Summer Fans  8th got 4 Chocobo Tickets  9th got 3 Chocobo Tickets  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  So enjoy the event! ^^v /tell me if you want to team up with a ( Hume F) or a (Tarutaru M)  I got my Onoko Yukata so far, when I get home I plan to get the Lady Yukata =)

      Ping suggested that we start doing some more LS events such as NM hunting.  This could be a good time for 3 things:  -Getting the LS together -Making a small profit (depending on how many show up) -piss off the other NM hunters ^^;  If anyone has any other ideas, please let us all know in the LS.   I know rank is one, but doing that every weekend will get VERY tiring... @.@  Enjoy the summer fest while it is here! (^_^)d     I am pretty sure there will be more to the fest in a few days.

      Getting really bored in my GE class, so I figured I would make a quick post.  Thanks Yoki for setting up the domain! I had no problem with the url before, but this is nice. ^^;   I was trying to get the LS ( EssenseOfDarkness) to combine a month ago, but that didn't work out too well. We finally made the big move and it seems to be working out well. Though I think some of the LW members are wondering where this chunk of members came from. @.@ If Yoki does not have enough bandwith to support images being posted, I can check out a small plan so everyone can post their images from FFXI.  Well, I need find something else to kill time now. see everyone on the game.    -Endless

      As the title says, stopping in to introduce myself.  I've talked to most of you at one time or another.  If you have any questions or anything let me know.  Yoki, I also was curious about a message board and possibly a place for LS members to post screenshots if they so desire.  Hopefully this will be a good place for people to stop in when they're at work, school or otherwise detained from FFXI!  AHh, need our fix. ^^  There I go running on again.  Also wanted to say welcome aboard, I've known Endless and Ping too kinda sorta about two monthes now and they're nice people, so I think I can say I trust their judgement and everyone will fit in smoothly!  Usually transitions such as this can cause some difficulty, but I believe it will be for the better for us all.   That is all I have for now, if you have any questions for me just shoot me a line in game, or even here.  I'll probably check in all the time during the week, but weekends are my time so I usually am on game or with family. :D  Hal

      Frontmission will be comming to Playonline pertty soon now. They are already seeking PS2 Boradband owners in Japan to praticipate in the beta. *sigh* I don't know if I can afford IDs for both Final Fantasy, and Frontmission!! DAMN you Square!  For those who have never played, the frontmission series are a set of Mecha based turn based stragegy games developed by squaresoft durring the mid 90s. The most recent incarnation is Frontmission 4 for the PS2, which is out now. The games mix political intrigue with highly customizable mecha.  Screenshots of the new Frontmission online can be found here :  urlLink https://secure.playonline.com/fmo/guide/screenshot/index.html

      I like being able to do events with people/LS so if you ever want to farm,mine, NM hunt, etc. Let me know!  I use to farm a lot with Ping which was so much more fun. I plan to try it out again with Magicite and Pinglou this weekend.  Blm, Sum/Thf, and Brd/Rng = zero down time farming XD    Also, if anyone is up for log/mine feel free to just tell me when. Having a partner for this sort of thing makes it go faster.   So if your up for money making + group fun then /tell. \(^-^)/    -Endless
