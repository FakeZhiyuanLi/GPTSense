      i just don't get it!!!!  i'm caught in dilemma n i'm thinkin just like any sensible ppl all over the world might.. whats up with these goddamn F*@  now i can just imagine whats goin thru ur mind. THAT IS SICK. COMPULSIVELY OBSESSIVELY SICK. i know rite?   U n i will both agree when i say it might just be the worst case of mental illness but whats worst is when ur filthy rich(asin who cheated their way to stardom, who DOESNOT deserve to have, what they have n they helpless try to put everyone under the magic spell of their "richness* " (supposedly) n wanting to make everyone their slave (emotionally) who need everyone to literally worship them) and u try to buy ppl, flauntin their filthy richness. THAt my fren is NOT the worst case.. THAt is Undpubtedly A GONE CASe. LITERALLY..   But the story  doesnot just end here dude nauuhh.. what happens is that some ppl fall under their spell, some compelled by greediness, some desparate for some used stuffs they might hopefully pick up thrown by the filthy ones. so they get caught in the trap they might never free themselves from(poor things). BUt thanks to the almighty there are still some ppl who won't give into the temptation n resist the fowl air of greed n materialism to stand up for their worth their right n values as a human beingwith morals. But when the goin gets tough the tough gets goin. so it reaches a point where things are over the top n intense with fury. what ends up happening?  filthy makes offensive remark abt something totally superficial which just can't be ignored since it is so painful (but ofcourse focused on  doin what they do the best filthy doesnot not understand umm... let me rephrase that.. doesnot HAVE the capability to think abt) that she can't hold back and sharply retorts back.......after a sec nothing but SILENCE REIGNS..OOUCHHH!!! that must have HUrt..OOOOoooooo SUCKA!  which eventually leads to me writing this shit in rage ULTIMATE RAGE I TELL U>>  ....that bitch  god i should do this more often infact everytime i'm angry i feel so much better already. pheww.. ppl note my point its more like a anger management thingie. seriously. ok i'm outtie here.. PEAce OUt .

                As crazy as it may sound I believe that ppl need, in fact they want to they crave to believe in something, something they can relate to as real, immortal n ultimately invincible. That is why some believe that there IS life after death, some believe in holy spirit and some want to believe that there is no god. This very craving leads some to go to church every Sunday and some to NOT go to church in their lifetime. (if u know what i mean). Everyone has a different theory abt life and its ways. And they want+need to live by it. Emphasis on NEED as it is like a emotional desire that a human yearns to fulfil even if it makes them blindly believe in something totally convincing yet...deceptive. Although this is what I believe in I am also a victim as i want to believe in this theory. Now Don't get carried away..coz it is Just a theory, My thoery n i don't expect anyone to agree with me. I just wanna make my voice heard.
