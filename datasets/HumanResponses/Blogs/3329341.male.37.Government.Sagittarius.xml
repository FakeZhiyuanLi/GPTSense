      Hmmm, this is my first post on this blog.  A bird flew in our garage tonight and I couldn't get it out.  It already defecated on our van.  I tried but I couldn't get it to fly out.  I left the door open in case it had the initiative to fly out on its own, but when I checked later it was sitting on the garage door sensor wires all fluffed up.  I think it plans to stay the night.  Well, that is all.  Enjoy.

      Well, we still don't have our "special" stain.  I stopped by the store in town today and they didn't get any in with their shipment this week.  The manager said he could specifically order some with their next order, but I said I would try to find it somewhere else since we wanted to get this done as soon as possible.  I called the manufacturer to get details on the dealer in Williston (because when Nancy had called previously they had told her one was there) so that maybe Nancy's mom could bring it out when they come this weekend.  Now they told me the only two dealers listed for North Dakota were in Bismarck and Fargo.  So I called paint and lumber companies in Williston until I found one that was a dealer but only special ordered that particular brand of stain.  Tomorrow I will call the store in Bismarck to go ahead and have them get some for us.  The stain is made by  urlLink Messmers  and is the Navajo Red color.  Apparently that color was not very popular so nobody around here stocks it.  In fact the four gallons we picked up last Saturday were ready to be sent back to Messmers.  Stain like that is very expensive, $24 per gallon.  So far we have used 21 gallons and need to get two more to finish.  Today was very warm, got up to 90 degrees I think.  After work I watered some dry spots in the lawn and then went to work watering the garden.  After a while I noticed that D was looking hot and red in the face, so I stopped watering so the kids could all play in the sprinklers.  They had so much fun.  When I had them in bed I went back out and finished with the garden.  The garden really grew since the last time I saw it two days ago.  Pretty amazing.  I'm looking forward to this weekend.

      Just looking up stuff on the Pampered Chef web site.  Nancy is going to a Pampered Chef party and wants me to pick out something to buy.  If you ask me it would be nothing.  That stuff is kind of overpriced.  The last time she went to a party we bought a grapefruit knife and something else (I can't remember the other item).  The knife works great, but we don't eat grapefruit very often.  Oh well, I'll find something.  I wonder how much their candy thermometers are.  The walk/run went OK.  It was very hard, being the first time in a very long time.  I've gone on walks lately but to incorporate running is tough.  Gotta keep it up though.  I so badly need to improve my health, for both me and my family.  I want to be around for a long time, to see my kids grow up and become adults and to grow old with my wife.  I'm glad in my post below I mentioned spending time with the family, not just the kids.  My wife wouldn't have appreciated that if I had forgotten to include her.  For a while I couldn't remember which I had written.  Watched Dr. Phil today.  Wow, he had some screwed-up family on the show.  Of course I had to watch the whole thing to find out all the details.  Goodbye for now.

      Well, I'm off to do some walking/running.  Hopefully the start of a new exercise program for Brucellosis.

      Traveling is getting old.  Even though I don't have to travel excessively, I would rather spend the time with my family every evening.  I complain about this too much, but I love being home and doing things with the family.  It is hot and calm here today.  I guess the kids were out for five minutes and came back in because they were too hot.  Supposed to get close to 90 degrees.  Still working to get our stain.  I called the store we got the four gallons from to see if we could order just two more gallons.  The guy looked and found one more gallon, and said he would set it aside for us.  Nancy went up but the guy I talked to was not there and no one else could find where he had put the stain.  So she went home empty.  They told her now that more should come in either today or tomorrow.  I will stop in tomorrow to see if some came in.  Otherwise Nancy will have her mom try to get some, as they are still planning to come for the weekend.  Never imagined it would be such a saga to purchase the remainder of our stain.  Please keep your voice down.  Thank you.

      We plan on going to Duluth later this summer.  I am looking forward to that, it should be fun.  Will be a nice getaway.  Nancy's brother lives in Duluth.  Nancy had talked about taking the kids on the pizza train.  I just looked it up and costs are $17 for adults and $12 for kids 3-13.  This includes 1/2 of a 14" pizza for each person.  The pizza is 1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 sausage unless you request an all cheese pizza.  Also included is a soda.  Still, it is too expensive.  What I'd like to do is go to the  urlLink Duluth OMNIMAX Theatre  to see the  urlLink NASCAR IMAX movie .  Even if I have to go to it by myself.  Looks like a good movie.

       urlLink Rush  was back today after being gone for a week. Missed his show though. I usually have him on at work, but it is just background noise because I am in such deep concentration. Mainly I am just trying to stay awake.

      I am just tired.  Don't get enough sleep.  The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) doesn't help, though.  It is quite a bit warmer today (we hit mid 80s) and is supposed to be this way all week.  This is the first day we've used our air conditioning since the beginning of the month.  Our neighbors have had their's on all month, even on the cooler days.  They are on the west side of our duplex and take the brunt of the hot afternoon and evening sun.  I am tired of dreaming about finding a new job.  I think I have been looking fervently for at least one and a half years.  I've limited it to jobs in my field, which makes it a lot more difficult.  We can't afford to take a pay cut and this limits it even more.  I have faith that someday I will find that job that is just right for me.  I interviewed recently for a UPS driver job.  That is a job I think I could like.  Being outside, getting exercise, driving.  Sounds good.  Actually I would have made more money than I am now.  They were looking for people with experience, though, and I have none, other than driving a grain truck on the farm.  Our dog poops a lot.  Our backyard is starting to look like a barn yard.  Need to clean that up.  Me steppy in poopy.  Our big Independence Day thing is Sunday evening.  We plan on having our friends Barb and Jason over with their two kids.  In addition, Nancy's parents and brother will be here.  I can't have any beer because I have to donate plasma the next morning. (Alcohol elevates a certain blood test.  If it is too high, you end up permanantly deferred.  We cannot afford that at this time.)   There is usually a good fireworks display in our neighborhood, and we'll shoot some off too.  Hard to believe how fast time flies, to be this time of the summer already.

      I am still a little obsessed with getting a  urlLink Gmail  invite.  Just so sick of Hotmail.  I looked at buying one on eBay, but how do you know they really have an invite to sell?  Would be pretty easy to get scammed there I would think.  Here it is after midnight and I am still up.  I just do not get to bed on time.  I am definitely more of a night person.  I saw  urlLink Mitch Hedberg  on  urlLink Comedy Central  a month or so ago.  Really funny guy.  Just love his sense of humor and his delivery.  Love the  urlLink Dave Chappelle Show  as well.  His personal site is  urlLink here .  Time for bed.

      Just got the kids in bed.  Tonight was a beautiful night.  We had a picnic at Sleepy Hollow, then went to a track at a local school for the kids to ride bike.  G was adamant that he didn't want to ride bike.  We made him do it and in the end he didn't protest.  He seemed to forget how to get started, though.  He said, "Dad, I can't stop running!"  So I said, "G, you need to pedal."  "Oh, yeah."  Man, it hadn't been that long since he rode.  Maybe a few days.  After he got going he had great fun.  He went around the track seven times.  Nancy stained another six sections of our fence.  She is just doing a great job.  Only six more sections left.  Need to find a place to buy the last two gallons of stain.  She is going to call in the morning to find a local distributor that might have some in stock.  We are using  urlLink Messmers  stain.  We got 0.40 inch of rain last night.  A much needed rain.  We are very thankful.

      This morning we purchased more stain for our fence.  The store only had four gallons and we figure we need six.  We bought the four gallons and will need to either order two more or find another place in town that has the same stain.  Nancy's goal is to finish the staining by Independence Day weekend, and it looks like she might make it.  Went to a couple of motorcycle dealers today to check out cycles for kids.  Visited the Yamaha and Kawasaki dealers.  So far the Yamaha would have the best fit.  They had both an 80 and a 90.  Kawasaki goes from a 50 to a 110.  The 50 is too small and the 110 is too big.  Want to visit the Honda dealer this coming week some time.  We are just looking to gauge what size would be the best.  Unless we come into a bunch of money we won't be purchasing a new bike, and most likely we will wait until next year unless a good deal comes up right now on a used bike.  I would like the kids to get experience on a motorcycle.  It was a big part of my growing up and I'd like them to experience it as well, if they want to that is.  G was pretty excited about looking at the motorcycles but I'm not sure he is really ready quite yet.  Toby the puppy spent all afternoon outside with us and he is tired out now.  He slept from 5-10, woke up, and was back in his crate at 11:00.  Nancy offered to get up with him tomorrow morning so I could sleep in for once.  That is very nice.  I worked in the garden this afternoon, did more lawn watering, and did some painting on our shed.  Nancy worked for six hours staining our fence, and completed six sections (section being from pole to pole).  She rules!  Right now we are getting a good rain.  Boy, we needed that.  I've got a peaceful, easy feeling.

      Holy.  Went to bed last night at 1:30 and the puppy got up at 6:00.  Short night.  I managed to catch a couple of snoozes on the couch before everyone else got up but it didn't amount to much.  I'll be tired today.  One benefit of getting up early is getting a start on watering the lawn.  Would be nice to have a sprinkler system, but we don't.  I have to set up and move sprinklers.  It isn't bad, over the years I pretty much figured where to set up to get the best coverage.  We had a really good rain a couple of weeks ago but no rain since then, and it is getting dry once more.  Hopefully we get rain before Independence Day so we can shoot some fireworks.  Well, off to go to town for errands.  CUL8R.  Brucellosis signing off.

      I'd like to create a family blog.  A blog where we can update each other on family events/goings on and maybe post a few pictures.  I've read how to do it and it isn't hard.  I'm just not sure my brothers and sister would want to create a blog of their own.  Just because they create a blog doesn't mean they have to use it, right?  I'll have to think about it.  It would be pretty neat, I think.  My sister-in-law set up a family site on MyFamily. It worked good, but kind of died out, and some time after that MyFamily started charging for the site.  I more seriously considered setting up a community on Blurty or Livejournal, but I think those are more complicated to set up and use.  Might hinder my family from joining in on the family community/blog.  Blogger is very simple to get started on and very easy to work with.

      Oh, I almost forgot to tell this funny story.  It's one I'm sure I'll remember for the rest of my life.  Nancy's parents took us out to a local Chinese buffet restaurant this weekend.  We are eating and Nancy's dad goes back for more.  I see him talking to one of the employees, asking, "Where is the bread?"  He had to repeat it because I assume her English wasn't the best.  She summoned another employee to talk to him.  He asked for the bread again.  The answer was, "Oh no, we don't have bread."  To this Nancy's dad said, "Well, you should.  This is a farm state and we need to support the farmers."  It wasn't really embarrassing because he often says stuff like that, it was more amusing than anything.  He really is big on his bread.  Not happy unless bread is on the table.  If you think about it, first of all, there is breading on most of the food in the buffet, and secondly, the farmers really don't get that much from a loaf of bread.  Every little bit helps though, I suppose.  Maybe someone else wouldn't find it funny, but it was to us.  We'll most likely mention it every time we go to an oriental buffet.

      When you wish upon a star . . .  I've read that some active posters on Blogger are getting invites to Gmail.  I wouldn't consider myself active, but I have posted a fair amount lately.  However, my profile shows nothing as far as number of posts.  I suppose that is because I don't have this on Blogger Listings.  Oh well.  Goodnight, my love

      We did go to  urlLink Shrek 2  today.  I don't think it was as good as the first one.  Loved Puss 'n Boots, though.  Stopped at  urlLink Radio Shack  after the show to pick up some of the stuff for G's battery and magnet projects.  Ended up spending $36!  Holy cow.  Too much.  I plan to go to  urlLink Wal-Mart  tomorrow to check for some items that might be less expensive.  Also need to get five gallons of stain for the fence and stop at a motorcycle dealer with G to check out some of the kid size motorcycles.  I should enjoy that.  I would love to see him start riding pretty soon.  Would probably wait until next summer to get one, if we had the money.  The internet links are just a check to see if I get them right.  I am familiar with HTML but not with blogging.  Next I need to test out inserting photos.  Oh, and don't forget to check out  urlLink Mopars On The Prairie .  Thank you for your support.

      Another gorgeous day today.  Nice and cool.  I wouldn't complain if the whole summer was this way.  Of course, others complain that it is too cool and wish for hot weather.  Worked in the garden again tonight.  Our garden is over 2000 sq. ft., it is huge!  The husband of one of my wife's friends is close to taking a job in Arizona, but she and her daughter would probably stay here because she signed a teaching contract for next year.  I would think she could get out of the contract, but what do I know.  Anyway, she called Nancy today and was pretty emotional about it.  I know in the past the marriage was kind of rocky, so I am sure something like this would certainly not help.  Seems to me it would be best if the husband stayed in his present job.  Best for his family anyway.  His parents live in Las Vegas and her parents and sister live in North Dakota.  I guess she has had to move often and quit her jobs when he has taken new jobs, so maybe this is kind of a stand for her to make - saying that this time I am not going to quit my job.  Who knows, maybe she'll cave in and move with him.  I don't know, it's not really for me to figure out.  I am just happy my wife and I are on the same page and, barring unusual events, plan to stay here in Bismarck for the rest of our lives.  On the positive side, though, is the fact that I would probably put in for his job if he left.  Just one more opportunity for me to screw up a job interview, right?  My wife hates it when I talk like that.  Well, that is all folks.  Another exciting day in The Life of Bruce.

      The car show this weekend went great.  Beautiful weather, although it was a bit windy.  We didn't have as many cars as last year, but a lot of people came for the show, especially on Sunday.  I spent a lot of time collecting admission and taking pictures and video.  I can post a few of the pictures when I get the time.  It was also nice for our family picnic on Saturday night.  We were at Sertoma Park and brought my grill to prepare hamburgers and polish sausages.  Very good food.  Dad, Nancy, and I played some horseshoes.  Good times.  I so wish I could find a new job.  I am starting to think the only way is to get into a different field, but how does one do that?  We can't afford to send me back to college, and almost all of my work experience has been in this one field.  One job I wish paid enough and that I could get a job doing is some sort of drafting.  I love either mechanical or computer aided drafting.  It was almost my passion in college, I liked it so much.  Although I've enjoyed my career up to this point, I do regret quitting engineering in college.  Oh well, wait and see I guess.  We are keeping an eye open for library jobs here in Bismarck.  Nancy would love that type of job, and the extra $$ would help a lot.  We plan to go to Shrek 2 Friday afternoon.  Should be fun.  Our youngest boy, D, we plan to leave at a friend of Nancy's.  He wouldn't do the best to sit through a whole movie, he is only two years, five months old.

      Has it already been a month since I created this blog?  Hard to believe, time sure flies.  The bird in the previous post left our garage in the morning.  The kids found it dead later in the day.  West Nile, anyone?  Not much going on in my life.  Still looking feverishly for a new job.  Have been working quite a bit in the garden.  My two oldest just learned to ride bike without training wheels.  Boy, are they having fun now!  G was so afraid of learning that he said he didn't want to grow up riding bike.  Now all he wants to do is ride his bike around the local neighborhood.  After G learned, A also wanted to go without training wheels.  She did, and rode great the first time.  I took G three times before he really started to ride well.  We knew he could do it, but he is just so afraid of learning new things like that.  Tomorrow is the start of our big Mopar car show.  I'll be there for the most part of both days.  Saturday evening we are having our Father's Day picnic with assorted family members attending.  Thank you for your support.

      Last week Friday I finally ordered the stain direct from the manufacturer. We just kept getting the runaround from the supplier here in town. Every time we stopped in someone would say, "Well, it might/should be on the next shipment. Stop in then and we'll check." One time one of them told me they would try to get it from another store in their chain. I stopped in last on Thursday when the manager just told me again to keep checking in.   We don't have time for that so I made the decision to order from Messmer's and get the fence finished once and for all. Shipping was $3 for each gallon, but at least we'll be able to get this done. Heck, it is almost time to start restaining some parts of the fence. (This has been an ongoing project for several years, until this year when my wife decided she was sick of looking at it and would finish it herself.) &nbsp; I think we'll wait&nbsp;a couple of years before restaining the fence.

      Honey, I put $5 gas in the car.  I didn't realize those outdoor fireplaces might be fairly expensive.  The good one at Menards was $130, and the on that looks like it might last only a couple of years was $70.  Next I'll check Wal-Mart.  I'd like to go there anyway to get the kids a  urlLink Slip 'N Slide .  Back to work . . .
