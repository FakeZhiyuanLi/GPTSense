       friday! friday! Yesterday, I called my friend from Latvia.  After 3 years of on and off communication I finally talked to her on the phone!  I called her up and it’s so cools when I heard her voice.  We immediately hit it off on the phone, no awkward silence or anything, just like in email and chatroom.  We sometimes think that were soulmates or something coz we usually think the same thing at the same time.  If we had the chance, we would have stayed at the phone for hours, but then poor girls like us can’t make an overseas call that would last for hours.  Maybe we will someday, when and we’re rich and married and happy. Believe it or not, we said exactly the same thing in our email right after we talked on the phone.   There’s something about Fridays…no matter how much work your doing, you just can’t feel it.  Today is a typical busy day for me but I’m not feeling tired yet and it’s almost 5 PM.  Maybe part of it is because I talked to ryan last night before I slept which is why I felt so recharged.  Yah, I finally got the chance to talk to him after like 3 tries.  He said he’s in class studying, his next exam was in an hour.  It’s kinda funny coz he told me ryan is not around and he asked me to leave a message.  I thought I was talking to his brother so I just told him to tell ryan that I called.  Then he asked me all these questions like who I am, where I’m from and why I’m calling.  I got very nervous coz I was thinking why his brother is asking me all these questions, that maybe he doesn’t approve of our relationship or something.  I don’t wanna be rude but I don’t wanna answer his questions too so I just asked him another question like why he wanted to know about my name and stuff.  But he kept on asking me these questions and I answered in the same manner too and asked him why until he finally said “sillo” then I knew it was him.  Sillo is a typo erroe for “silly” and that’s one of the names which he calls me.  We call each other lots of names but it’s funny what kind of names he comes up with.  He calls me choco chip pie, choco ice cream, pecan pie something (can’t remember exactly), honey bunny, sweeti pie or cup cake or whatever that comes to his mind.lol Now, that I think about it, there’s one thing in common about the names – it’s all food! Is he thinking of eating me? Hmmmm…if he meant it in a sensual way it’s turning me on. =)  But there’s one name we seriously and consistently call each other that sometimes it’s like our name now and that’s jan or janu.  “Jan” in urdu means life and “janu” means darling or honey.  Most of the time he calls me “jan” which is also short for janu.    Ryan is such a sweet guy which is why I’m falling in love with him more and more each day (if more is still possible!).  He does things that other guys wouldn’t have imagined doing.  I called him once and he was in school.  I asked for a kiss and he gave me coz he thought I’ll get angry if he doesn’t give me one after I asked for it.*sigh* Same thing happened last night.  As I’ve told you before, he was studying in his classroom for his next exam and he’s whispering the whole time.  It’s kinda funny coz I think he’s trying to hide the fact that he’s acting silly with his gf from his classmates.  I mean he looks like this tough guy but he asks mushy and silly around me.lol  Anyway, I asked him for a kiss (I was trying to find out how strong is my convincing power) and I was so persistent he finally gave me one right in the middle of everybody.  I love him so much when he does things like this, like he just can’t say “no” to me.  He doesn’t have this macho complex like some of the guys have.    Is this how contentment feels like? Ohhh, I feel so blessed!=)

       my day is just beginning an yet… I have this middle-aged (40 something I think) officemate and she’s really pissing me off.   She’s asking me these stupid questions again!  Why can’t she just look for the answers herself?! Commonsense is all she needs!  She’s such a lazy b****! It happens not just once but like thousand times in a day! I’m so irritated with her I wanted to yell at her sometimes and tell her “are you stupid or what!”.  But, of course I’ll never do that, I have never been so blatantly rude to anyone esp. to people older than me no matter how irritating they are.  But I lost my temper with her once and answered her in a nasty and that’s practically it.  The worst that I have done is just ignore her even though she’s talking to me coz I don’t wanna lose my temper and blurted something disrespectful.  Besides, I don’t wanna create friction between us or else we’ll never be able to work harmoniously together. So, I had to be patient and try to adjust to her stupidity.       Wait a sec…  Ok, I’m back. I just made a call to ryan but he’s not answering his phone. He’s probably busy studying for his finals.  Anyway, he did send me a sms a while ago so I thought I’d call him.  You know, I really get pissed when I’m making a call and nobody answers my call.  We even had a fight about that when I tried to call him 3 times before and he didn’t answer those 3 times that I called.  I was so pissed I lost my temper and told him I’ll never call him again coz my calls aren’t getting answered anyway.  He thought I was breaking up with him but I’m not. I’m just angry and hurt that’s why I said those things.  That’s why as much as I can I try not to get angry or lose my temper at him coz I don’t wanna say something I might regret later.  I know he’s a little sensitive although he doesn’t show me but there are times when he brings that up after few days and that’s when I knew that what I said had hurt him.  I have a very sharp tongue and sometimes I’m so tactless that’s why I have to watch my words and say everything carefully. But I’m not the only one who has these flaws, he’s also sometimes very rude and curt but I know he doesn’t mean too.  It’s just the way he is and I’m getting used to it now.  I still love him though and I love it that he tries hard not to be curt to me. At least he’s trying just like I’m trying to control my temper.  Controlling your temper is not an easy thing to do.  It is hard!  I have to like exerting so much effort and putting too much energy just to get hold of my emotions and keep myself from blurting some painful remark out.  When I’m angry, I’m like the devil as my friend used to tell me.  It’s like I’m a different person.  I end up throwing everything I can get hold of like my friend’s large bottle of CK perfume (sorry for that mel!).  Yah, I threw it at the floor and it was broken into pieces and it’s still more than half full.  Our house smelled like a CK perfume factory for 2 days that I thought I was going to have sinusitis.  I even threw a thick novel at my ex once and it hit him in the head.  What happened after I did all those stuff to my friends and ex? Well, they forgave me afterwards and apologized for making me angry. =) I know it’s not a good thing and that they have made me a little spoiled. That’s what I like about this new relationship, I can’t get away with anything anymore.  I mean I’m a little tamed now than before *wink* although I do lose my temper sometimes but it’s not as bad as before.  I just don’t wanna do something that would turn off ryan and think I’m such a bitch or something.  He means the world to me and I’m glad that I finally found someone who makes me want to be a better person.  It doesn’t mean that he told me or even wanted me to change coz nobody can make me change.  If he does that I don’t think I’ll like him more coz it will be contrary to what I know about him and why I liked him.  We’re from different religions and it means so much to me that he’s not forcing anything on me.  He just wants me to be what I am and not tell me to do this or that and that’s what I like most about him.  I just hate it when people tell me to change no matter how good their intention is.  My initial reaction would be to do exactly what they don’t want me to do and exaggerate it a little.  I mean why do they want me to be their friend if they wanna change me anyway? The initiative to change has to come from me and I’ll decide when I want to change or not and this time I wanted to change some of my attitude for the love of ryan although he didn’t tell me to change.  I just have the feeling that we will have a more harmonious and lasting relationship if I don’t lose my temper all the time.  See what I mean?

       real world  I was on my way home yesterday, it's a little after 7 PM and I really wanna get home already so I got on the first bus that I saw that will bring me home. It's an ordinary bus, so minus the airconditioning unit. Oh boy, it's so hot inside so I took off my blazer. At first, I was just sitting by myself until this old man sat beside me. If you live in this city, you'll probably understand why my guard is always up esp when you're in a public transpo.  I mean whether you're in a jeepney or in a bus or in taxi, there's will always be holduppers or muggers around. Anyways, this old guy beside me keeps on looking at me (I think he's really looking at my bag) sideways in a discreet manner.  But when your guard is up and your paranoid, you'll notice this thing no matter how much he tries to disguise it. So, I kept looking at him and at his hands coz I was expecting him to just point a knife at me or something but he didn't. Several stopovers after, he still didn't make a move and it turned out that he was on the wrong bus and the ticketer told him to just get off at the nearest stop and get another bus. When he got off the bus I felt some kind of pity towards him coz the way he moves reminds me of my grandfather.  It's like they're these old people who tries hard to be independent and what do people like me do? We suspect them as robbers just because he was dressed poorly or something. I felt like I have been a snob although everything was just in my thoughts. Anyway, that realization still didn't let me relax my guard. When you live in this city, you just know that that's not a smart thing to do.  I got off at the highway, where I'm supposed to walk a little bit more and get another ride, and I was stopped at my track at the sight of people lying (or living?) at the sidewalk.  It think it's more like they live there already coz they were like preparing their bed or something and it's like they consist of different families and it's really shocking. I mean it's different if you see squatters or robbers on TV but when you see them in person it's so unreal. I hope they're not thinking of living there for good coz I don't mean to be a snob but I scared of this kind of environment. You know how poverty breeds criminals and some of them even killers. I remember a shooting incident just outside our house and it was scary coz your home is supposed to be a place where you're safe but in this case you're not safe anymore even at your own home. Anyway, it turned out that this policeman's cellphone was snatched from him by this 3 other guys who is carrying with them a gun. It's scary coz the policeman was only right outside his house in his car ans somebosy robbed him.  Good thing he has his gun with him.  I guess they didn't know he's a cop. But you know, these incidents make you very paranoid.  Okey, I don't wanna end my post with these thoughts.  I wanna end it happily and when I say happy you already know who I'm talking about....RYAN. It's only our second day of not chatting and yet it already felt like a week. I wonder how are we gonna survive when he moves back to pk. I mean we can't chat everyday anymore as we used to. =( Okey, I don't wanna dwell on that yet either. I wanna end this happy. Let me just tell you about our sms instead. I guess we can never be really totally out of touch. =) I sent hima message and told him that I missed him and he replied back. Then after a little later he told me he's doing some sort of project and he's really missing me.  I told him not to miss me too much or else he's not gonna finish anything. So, he asked me for a coffee and we pretended to be together from then on. I gave him coffee made with love and a kiss too and waited for him to finish his project. Anyway, I think he slept a late already coz the last time I did was remind him to go to  bed coz I don't want him to sleep while driving and he told me not to worry coz he'll sleep in my arms. Ain't he sweet? I think that's it. I don't think I left anything out. How can I? =)  I was talking to Inese earlier but she didn't reply my last message. I guess she's probabaly working hard now.  I really like talking to her coz we really jibe. We were penfriends for 3 yrs now although there were some communication gaps in those 3 years.  But when we renewed our friendship, nothing changed. We're like soulmates. We both have online boyfriends although she and her love have met already. I just love talking to her coz she understand everything I've going through coz she's been there. Anyway, one reason why I also love talking to her is coz she let's me gush about ryan all I want.=)

       my so-called day Without ryan, my day seems boring. It kinda reminds me of that stupid card that his ex-girlfriend gave him on valentines day. The cards says "My day is boring without you" and we almost had a fight coz of that. I don't know why some girls just never give up even after knowing that the guy is not in the market anymore. I really can't tell if it's ryan's fault or the girls coz I'm miles and miles aways from them. That's what's hard about online relationship, you can never be really 100% sure but I do trust ryan so I decided to believe him 99%. Trust is very important in this kind of relationship and he trusts me too. If there's no trust between us then I don't know how are we gonna make it work.  Since I've already opened the topic about his ex-girlfriend, I have to admit that I'm kinda insecure of that girl coz ryan told me that she looks a lot like jlo, as in jennifer lopez! The first time I knew I almost freaked out! But I'm over it now although not after some arguments. We almost always argue about anything under the sun, we just don't have anything in common. I told him that if ever we disagree on something, I want us to disagree agreeable. Am I making sense? =) Anyways, back to that ex-girlfriend, I've already mentioned that she just never gives up and she showed it by giving my ryan stupid candies during Easter Sunday and I was so pissed off. Since she was not around I fought with ryan instead. I told him never to take anything from her again coz it's pissing me off. He told me he doesn't want to hurt her feelings and all or she might cry or something and I told him I don't care even if she commits suicide! (uhm...I didn't exactly say that, but it was kinda close to that =)) I know I was being mean and he told me so too but I was really pissed. Anyway, the end of the argument was that he finally agreed never to take anything from her again even if it means being rude to her (good for her! why can't she get her own man!).  He told me he knows she didn't really care about him like I do coz the moment they broke up, she was trying to hit on his friend. Btw, they're all working at the same place.  Back to the events of my day (in ryan's word "days of our lives"...ya, just like that soap opera), I was really missing him esp at around 10 AM so I sent him an sms telling him I'm missing him.  I didn't expect him to reply coz he's probably in the middle of studying but he did and I was very happy about that and it's enough to get me going for the day. As for the rest of the day, it's a typical day for me, manageably busy except for the stupid cramps that I have (it's a girl thing...u know what I mean) which was quite "unmanageable".  I mean it's too painful and everytime I have my period I always have this cramps.  I used to take pain reliever everytime I have it but I'm trying not to be too dependent on pain killers. But believe me, without the pain killers it is awfully painful. Once, I almost fainted here in the office so I had to go home.  I was also thinking of going home around lunch but I just tried to make myself comfortable and try to not to think about it. It's really hard to do that but I think I was able to coz I'm still in the office even after 5 PM. Mind over matter really works!  Actually, there's really something not typical to this day. I had lunch with my boss and my other lady colleague and one senior officer from another department.  What makes it interesting is that I had a crush on that "senior officer" (hey ryan, no need to be alarmed okey! hehe!). It's not really a serious crush coz he's 45 yrs old or something, but still I got a little conscious sitting at the same table with him. He's very attractive and very sexy and he smells good too. I don't know what's it about Indians or Pakistanis or dark men but I really find them sexy. Well, not really most of them but I meant the "nice looking" ones which I can't absolutely describe coz beauty is always relative. Don't worry coz I'm not lusting over this guy the whole time we're having lunch. Truth is, I was actually thinking about ryan coz he's of the same race too. And I kinda drift of to dreamland once in a while and imagine about my ryan and how sexy he is and everything. These are what real men are made of...very masculine and sexy. *sigh* Now, I'm really missing my jan more. I wonder if he's dreaming about me right now. =)  I'm really gonna miss him more and more each day and I know it would be very hard not to talk to him for a week (sob...sob...). I just hope he won't miss me so much he wouldn't be able to study anymore. I like the thought that he's really missing me but I don't want him to flunk any of his subjects. And mind you, terribly missing someone during exam period is no kidding matter.  I used to miss my family a lot more during exams coz I was already looking forward to going home and it's very hard to concentrate. Then I've also experienced breaking up with someone before an oral compre exam in grad school and it was just so terrible.  You have to really gather your will power just to focus for 5mins, much more for a couple of hours. It's pure torture! I remember my jan told me he had to study at the libray during his midterms coz he just can't concentrate at home coz there are so many thing to remind him of me. Then his fingers are getting itchy he wanted to just come online and start talking to me. That's why he had to live. =) God, I'm so glad I'm done with school or else....

       soulmates? Oh God, I'm sooooo giddy happy right now.  It's 3 PM meaning I'm in the midst of so much work I'm just so giddy.  I can't contain myself I felt like bursting so I had to stop whatever it is I'm doing to write this down. Thanks so much to blogger.com or else I would just blow up. =) Actually, what happened was not really a big deal in other people's point of view but for me it is such a big deal. When it has anything to do with the love of my life, it's very much a big deal to me.   Here's what actually happened:  I got a call from him this morning and I just got out of the shower and I was just in my towel. So, I felt a little naugthy and told him I was only wearing a towel and that he has to give me a veeeeeeeeeery deep kiss ( I guess that's what half naked in a towel dripping wet do to u esp when it's raining on his part of the world, u know what I mean *wink*). He told me later that I was killing him when I told him when we talked about it later in chat (I have a big grin on my face now). Anyways, my giddiness was not really due to that conversation. It's just part of the big pie.    It was almost lunch (my time) before we chatted coz he said he'll be out with a friend but it turned out he had to wait for me coz my boss just got back from his Shanghai trip (darn! darn! darn!) and we had a "short" meeting.  God, it felt like eternity esp after getting a msg at my phone that ryan is already online! I guess you know exactly how I felt that time. I felt like the time is dragging and it's like he's talking slow motion that I wanted to hurry him up or just tell him to shut up.  Sitting there is just pure torture!  At last the torture has ended, he had to take a call or make one (God bless that person!), and I'm free! Yippee! And now the part which has really made me happy is what I found out about him today. It's not really a big deal but for both of us, who almost never have anything in common (believe me I'm not exaggerating!) from movies to juices u name it, it's a BIG deal for me to know that we have finally found something in common between us.  I told him that I love rains and he said he does too coz it makes him sad and he likes being sad. I can't believe it when I heard him say that coz I felt exactly the same way.  Then I tried to find out some more....I told him that I love gazing at the moon and stars and that I love the moon more than the stars coz it looks more sad. And you know what? As soon I pressed the enter key, I got his next message. He said he loves looking at both too but he loves the moon more than the stars. I suddenly felt like we were soulmates. =) I know it sounds silly but I was happy that we finally had something in common. As for the soulmate part, it's just that sometimes stuff like this happen to us. Like we'll say exactly the same thing or ask the same questions or sometimes when I miss him and I'm trying to decide whether to sms or call him or not, just as soon as I touch my phone I get a message from him. And that happened more than once!  So, are we really soulmates or is it ESP? I don't know, I really don't believe in both. I guess it must be love. *sigh* God, I really love my ryan. I'll tell that to the moon this evening just in case he'll talk to that heavenly body up there one of these nights although he stopped "whispering" to the moon eversince we started chatting.  I'm his life now...his jan (meaning "life" in their language).  Well, same thing goes for me...he's my life too. *sigh*

       just blah blah I talked to ryan yesterday about my dad and he said I shouldn't make a a big deal out of it.  That I should only believe it when I see it with my own eyes and not just hearing it from other people.  Part of me is happy about it coz it only means that he's not gonna doubt me just because someone told him something about me, not that I'm gonna do anything BAD.  But I'm happy that he has this attitude you know.  But part of me is  little sad coz he told me not to think about it too much.  It's like he didn't give importance to my angst or maybe he just don't want me to worry too much.  Maybe that'shis way of comforting me and keeping my mind from worrying.  Anyway, I did forget about it a little.  My mom told me that my dad called up last night and it sounds that there's no serious problem anymore.  Maybe it's not a serious thing.  I don't know.  I'm really not mad at my dad and I don't feel betrayed either.  He lives miles away from us so he probably got lonely or maybe it's guy ego thing.  He probably just wanted to feel good about himself, I mean test if he's still attractive to the opposite sex or something.  I guess men do that once they get a little older.  Maybe they feel that their manhood is diminished as time passed.  I remember telling ryan that I don't wanna get married if ever I find out that the thing about my dad is true.  He just laughed it off.  I guess he knows me well enough to think that I'm being overly dramatic again. =)  I'm watching Episode II later today with my mom and sis.  Right now I'm in the officeworking on my recommendation letter for the school I'm applying to.  I think this sort of letter are just full of crap.  I mean here I am writing nice things about myself and it's so bull!  But it's requirement in the college I'm applying for.  Actually, I passed the interview already, so this is just like some sort of requirement that I should complete.  Doesn't mean a thing coz it wouldn't affect my chance of getting in.  For goodness sake, I was accepted already! This is just a formality.  I appliead for another college the before last year and I needed like 3 recommendations and I fulfilled the requirements.  I passed the exams and interview and everything only to find out that I can't enroll anyway coz there's no classes offered after working hours.  Even on Saturdays or Sundays!  It's the best school in the country and it's supposed to be for the masses but they don't have any schedule fit for the masses! Crap!  I went through the whole stupid process and it's hard to get in, then only to find out that the sched is not for us working professionals!  It's not like it's undergrad school, it's graduate school for G*** sake!  (I wanna say God's sake or Christsake coz it has more impat than goodness sake, but I don't know it feels like sacrilege to use their name like that. =))  Anyway, I have to go.  I dunno if ryan is gonna chat with me today.  He seems very busy.  Maybe lots of homework.  He's taking a crash course in Advance English Composition. Hehehe...you know what that means. Lots of composition to work on.  I trust him so I don't doubt that he's flirting with some girl or anything.  He's not just the type  although I hate it when he miss to give me a morning kiss or a goodnight kiss or whatever like he did this morning.  Well, I'm not in a sour mood so I didn't make a big deal out of it.  But I'll give him an earful when I talk to him next time. =)

       oh men! When I came home last night, my mom and my sis were drinking Coke.  Nothing new.  Then my sis told me they're trying to get drunk and I actually thought they were coz I remember seeing 3 bottles of brandies in the kitchen that morning. So, I kinda tried to look if there's any of those bottles around but I didn't see any.  They said they were celebrating the "good news" so I wondered what this good news was.  The good news turned out to be a bad news, they just turned it opposite...what do u call it? Anyways, my mom told me that my aunt (she's not really my aunt, she's just close to us so we call her aunt) called her that night and told her about that "other woman" that my dad has.  My my....it's really some bad news.  But why was I not surprised? or angry at my dad? or panicky?  I don't know but I didn't take it seriously or I didn't take it as a hard blow.  Is it because I've expected that from men including my dad? Or is it because the realization has not yet dawned into me? It's like when someone dies you never really feell anything until the next hours when you realize that it's real and that it's not a dream.  My dad is kinda goodlooking (I'm not being biased here) and he's younger than my mom and most of all he's a MAN.  Man have always been polygamous in nature.  That's what I hate about them, they can't just stick to one girl.  That's why I'm afraid of getting married coz I'm afraid what happens next after the love has gone.  Will he look for another woman in the flock who'll give him new adventures...something like that?  Look at myself and ryan.  Ryan may profess that he loves me so much blah blah...but that's not proff that he'll love you still in the same ardour in the next years to come.  That's why I'm afraid of waiting...  The plan is ryan would go back to his country and study his religion for 3 yrs or more and that I would wait for him until he's finished with it.  I told him that the latest that I would wait for him would be five years.  I don't know if I'm being stupid waiting for him for five years.  But that's what my heart is telling me to do, wait for him.  I just felt that he's the guy for me coz I don't think he'll ever cheat on me and that's the most important thing for me.  He can have all the bad traits he can have but just don't cheat on me or beat me up.  But now, I was having this second thoughts and my brain is protesting my decision.  They don't want me to wait up and I think I'm being stupid again in the name of love. =(( I know that but.... It's really hard to break up with someone you love, I'm not ready to face the consequences yet...the long hours of sleeplessness, the crying, and the crazy thoughts.  I don't wanna go through all that yet.  I was thinking that maybe everything will turn out well of if not then maybe I can handle things better later.  This is so bad...I know this is obviously some delaying tactics and not facing the problem.  I can't even tell ryan that I can't take his "doing nothings" and his ultimatums coz I'm scared he'll say something that would break my heart.  I'm just not yet ready to face heartaches right now!  Ya ya I know that the more I delay it the harder it gets.  What can I do? I'm just scared!

       up then down I was not around for a day coz I was sick so I stayed home. Did you notice? I guess not.    I was in bed yesterday and I've neve felt so happy in my whole "sick" life than when I got a call from my ryan right after I told him I can't be online.  Boy! Did it made my day! I can just dance for joy! Tralalala.... He was so worried he called me up and he asked me if I'm okey...you know the drill. I was soooo in seventh heaven esp when he gave lots and lots of kisses.  I was so filled with love! He probably doesn't know this but those little things like being silly with me are enough to make me happy.  He was so sweet with his sms too right after talking to him and he kept on asking how I was feeling.  This morning, he even told me to just stay in bed coz he doesn't want me to work too much and that he's worried and all.  He's such a sweetie.    In the chatroom today, everything went well and he's in his usual self and I am too.  As much as possible I try not to take everything he says seriously coz I know that's how he is.  Everything is so sweet except for what he said (here's the chat transcript):       ryan: i wanna tell u something jan ryan: i really am not husband potential ryan: no kidding ryan: so just think abot it when u get a minute jazz: i know ur not husband potential jan jazz: it's written all over ur face and chatroom jazz: lol jazz: just dont beat me up jazz: i think i can take it jazz: whatever u r ryan: im not kidding  ryan: im really not jazz: i told u i know that jazz: i know i know jazz: okey ryan: and i dont know, but i think that can be a prob jazz: but ive accepted that fact long ago ryan: okey ryan: its ur call jazz: ya it's mine ryan: so just dont regret it later ryan: well i think u have enough time tho ryan: r u trying to scare me away jazz: ur only 20 so i dont expect u to be husband potential at that age ryan: doesnt matter even if im 30 ill be like this ryan: i wont change jan jazz: haha jazz: i dont think so jazz: i think ul become worst jazz: lol jazz: all i want is for u to love me forever and that's enough ryan: ya worst is a possiblity jazz: just love me okey jazz: i think i can take everything ryan: i think thats what every husband suppose to do jazz: just never cheating and beating up ryan: ya it is jazz: u think u can do that? ryan: ok ryan: i think i can do that jazz: c, okey ryan: but u dont want me to do any job right ryan: coz u know i just want to do NOTHING ryan: lol jazz: then do nothing jazz: i dont care jazz: just dont cheat on me or divorce me ryan: love u sweetie pie ryan: tnxs ryan: my chocolate chip cookie ryan: goodnight ryan: lol jazz: hmmm...sounds yummy ryan: im not that bad jan     So, what do you think.  Do you think I'm being downright stupid already?  Is this a sign for me to just split? I mean he loves me and he shows me that he loves me but sometimes when he talks...it's like this.  He's like telling me to leave him coz he leaves no choice for me.  He doesn't even try to please me or do something for my sake.  It's like take it or leave it, but the way he gives me the choices it's like a no choice for me. Am I wrong in hoping that he would still change as he grows older? I mean I'm doing exactly what girls aren't supposed to do - "hope that everything will be better in due time".  It's like some girls have this belief that their boyfriends will just change in time and I'm doing exactly the same thing!  I always pray to Him to let us end up together in the future coz I know that everything is in His hands.  In fact, I've always considered ryan to be an answer to my prayers.  I remember I did pray for someone to come to my life during Christmas eve, then I met him on the 26th, a day after Christmas.  I never thought that I'll fall in love with someone on the net coz I've always thought that it's stupid and all. But I guess love comes in most unexpected place and time.  Anyway, I'll really try to make it work this time.  I can't just give up.  What we have is worth fighting for, or is it?

       is it an age thing? My problem is I don't know how to enjoy life.  I mean I take life so seriously including my relationship with ryan. Yah, it's a serious relationship but I should know how to find fun in that relationship.  Having a boyfriend is supposed to be fun and giddy, but with me it's more like having problems to face.  Now that I think about it, maybe i should just take things one at a time coz thining too much of the future will make me crazy, or worst, ruin our relationship!  I don't know, maybe it's coz a couple of weeks more and I'll be 25! Maybe that's why I take things very seriously now coz it feels like time is running out.  Ryan was so sweet today. I have colds today and felt a little feverish, you know how it is with colds. So, he forced me to have lunch or have some soup (I like it when he does that!) and he did that by telling me we'll have soup together.  Anyway, I ended up having a whole feast at lunch instead of just the soup. I really love him to bits. I dont know if that good or bad but I just felt like saying "bits".=)  That's it. I dont feel like sharing much. I just wanna blog about ryan.  I felt like I was born to love him and nothing else.

       ryan! ryan!!  I was ranting last Saturday about ryan not paying me as much attention as I want to. Well, I didn't feel so good until early morning Sunday.  I cried for 2 hours last Saturday (I was charging my phone so I knew exactly how long I cried) and after church the next day.  I cried the whole time in bed I was getting a headache.  All these lovesongs on the radio just make me more emotional and I end up crying some more.  Then I got a little mad after crying and decided to watch TV instead of listening to lovesongs!  Well, I did that after I talked with Che-che (one of my 2 bestfriends in the whole world!) and she told me to be patient and reminded me that it's ryan's finals week. I felt a little better after that and a little guilty too for being pushy so I sent him an sms and said sorry and that he can take his time.   So, I decided to just work on that cd that I wanted to give him then watched some TV afterwards.  A few minutes of TV after, I finally got a call from the love of my life and it made my day.  I was grinning from ear to rea after the call (my sister told me so =)).  We had a nice chat and he told me he knows I was getting mad but he's just too busy and too tired.  At first I told him I'm not but he said he knows I am and so I admitted.  I told him I'm mad at him coz he didn't give me goodnight kiss and morning kiss last Friday and Saturday, respectively.  He told me I started it and he's a little upset too.  Anyways, we "kissed" and made up and everything is perfect again.  He's so sweet coz he gave me lots and lots of kisses (I asked for it but he happily obliged no matter how silly it is). I am getting more and more inlove with him with every kiss that he gave me. He told me he's not giving me anymore kisses when I asked for some more, but I told him I cried for 2 hrs the other night so I deserve those kisses.  And so he did.  He said that's the last but I asked for one final one and he did it again. Ohhh, my janu.  Now that I think about what he did yesterday, I suddenly felt guilty for being so pushy today.  I mean he finally had the chance to go out and have some fun and I got angry coz he was too tired to chat with me. I'm such an inconsiderate girlfriend.  I'm gonna make it up to him tomorrow. I really will.  My honey deserves a break.  I also chatted with Jeffy for 5 hrs (that's according to him) and it's fun but I was missing ryan the whole time. I kinda flirted (we both did) with him too a little but he knows I'm inlove with ryan so it's not like I was cheating.  It's more like playful fun and silliness and all.  Speaking of silliness, I love the way ryan calls me sillo. He's sleeping right now, I hope he's dreaming about me.=)

       suddenly, the sun isn't shining anymore I really feel like the weather nowadays. One moment the sun is shining happily, then the next it's dark then it rains.  I was so happy when I got to work this morning, just like a very light baloon flying into the nothingness of the sky.  I thought that maybe this is the way a baloon feels when it floats up in the air.  I felt like I was floating too.    Ryan came online at 9:23 AM, earlier than usual so maybe it has something to do with our sms this morning.  So, I was expecting that we are gonna have a great day today chatting, lots of teasing and everything.  But then I guess we shouldn't really expect too much coz we're bound to be hurt.  I don't know what happened, we started our chat in high spirits but suddenly evrything just changed.  Did I say something wrong?  I think I did.  Maybe his sudden switch in mood is because I told him he's not usually nice so how come he's being nice now.  Maybe he got sensitive about it coz he kept telling me that maybe he's curt and rude and mad and that he should change.  I don't know what to think.  I'm really hurting so much right now I wanted to cry my heart out, but I can't coz my face never returns to normal after crying even hours after.  We ended our chat like this and it really hurts: Ryan: even if i reply or not doesnt make any difference Jazz: i just want u to stay with me Jazz: ur bad today na Ryan: according to u. im always like this Jazz: i was just kidding Jazz: come on jan Ryan: no u were not Ryan: its true Jazz: u think il like u if ur really a bad guy? Ryan: u like me Jazz: i love u Ryan: but u said im always rude Jazz: ur not always rude na Jazz: oh pls Jazz: ur perfect for me Jazz: u dont believe me? Jazz: i truly love u Ryan: tnxs Ryan: im not nice Jazz: u r such a lion really Jazz: lol Jazz: but for me ur nice Ryan: ya curt Ryan: arrogant Ryan: mad Jazz: i told u i can live with that Jazz: i have no prob with u Jazz: what u want me to say Ryan: ya no prob Ryan: but probs Jazz: oh my Jazz: what kind of mood is my janu in? Jazz: lol Ryan: in which i always am, as u said Jazz: ok im sorry Jazz: im dumb and i say the wrong things Jazz: but i didn't meant it in a bad way Ryan: no im sorry Ryan: its my mood, so i should be sorry for it Jazz: no need to say sorry Jazz: maybe i complain too much about ur being curt Jazz: i wont do it again Ryan: u just said the truth Ryan: i should try to change it Jazz: im not complaining Jazz: it's ok jan Ryan: but i dont think ill be able to Jazz: maybe that's the way u are Jazz: and i fell in love with u anyway even if ur curt Jazz: so it's okey Ryan: not for me Jazz: so what u want to do Jazz: as long as it's not hard on u Jazz: u can change Jazz: but only until when ur comfortable with the change Ryan: i cant Ryan: okey im going Jazz: u can't what? Jazz: change? Ryan: i should now Ryan: goodnight Jazz: ok jan Jazz: as u wish Jazz: goodnight Ryan: love u Jazz: love u too Jazz: very much jan Ryan: bye Jazz: bye Jazz: miss u too Jazz: mwaaaaaaaaaaaaah:x Jazz: goodnight hon  Oh God, I'm such being a martyr.  Why do I have to always give in to everything he says? It hurts, it really does.  I don't know if I should sms him this pm or not.   I'm afraid that if I don't, the problem my get bigger.  I'm so afraid to lose him. He's my life now.  Oh God, how did I ever become like this?!  I hate being like this, but I hate to lose him too.  So, I'd rather be like this than lose him.  Anyway, he's entitled to his crazy moods to.  But even when I'm in this mood, I'm always the one who's giving in.  Whaaaaaaaa...I'm gonna go crazy. I just know that he's mad at me or something coz he never says just love u and bye and not give me a kiss.  I hope evrything will be better tomorrow even in sms. Coz I won't be chatting with him for 3 loooooooooong dayscoz I have to do some stuff.

       is the sun brighter or is it just me What a wonderful wonderful day! Ryan is so being extra nice today. I think he feels guilty for what he did yesterday and he's making up to me.  We exchanged more than the usual number of sms this morning.  He paid me compliments and all.  he even asked me what I'm wearing to office today and that he loves black coz that's what I'm wearing...I'm in all black.  Told me he knows I'm mad and he understand if I am.  But as I've told him lots of times, I am not mad.  I think I ought to be but I'm just not mad.  I don't know why.  I think it's because I really truly love him that's why I can never get mad at him.  He was so nice too last night when I got home.  We exchanged more than a couple of sms which is not usual. He told me he can change for me and that he's pretty sure he can change for me, coz he really loves me.  I'm so happy to hear that, but I told him not to change if it's hard on him.  I mean it's not that easy to change. Besides, I'll always accept him no matter what.  I think I can live with it.  I'm just happy with the thought that he can change for me.  That only means he does love me too much too.  Isn't that just heaven?*sigh*

       the gift I gave ryan a cd which I selected from my faves...well he didn't like it. I cried this morning coz I was so hurt.  I guess he's just being honest but he said it the wrong way.  I guesshe as alsways been curt.  I can't change him.  But he mad up for it coz he waited fro me till i finished lunch when he told me he's already leaving.

       catching up... I didn't blog about anything last Sunday and Monday, while yesterday's was short...it's either I was getting bored with this weblog or maybe I was just in a lazy mood.  My boss told me I have a seasonal mood.  I have a season for saying "no" to everything and sometimes I just say "yes" to everything.  Speaking of my boss, I'm kinda pissed of at him since last Sunday.  He is such a jerk! (Ryan told me not to call him a jerk, that I should be respectful of elders...I told him I was being respectful coz "asshole" was what I had in mind.  So, jerk is being respectful already.)   Anyways, here's what happened.  Last Saturday, I told him that I won't come to work on Monday coz I need to go to school for enrollment.  I can see that he doesn't want me to go but he has no choice.  He told me that maybe my sister could just bring the recommendation letter to my school for me so that I don't need to absent.  I told him I can't do that coz you're supposed to be there to enroll yourself.  There's no substituting.  What really pissed me off is his being such a spoiled old man and being so self-centered, like his life is more important than yours so you better prioritize his needs first or something like that.  I mean I know why he wanted me to come to work, he wanted me to help him with lots of his personal matters coz he'll be leaving for home leave this Friday.  It's not really about work or anything, it's about himself!  He totally ruin my evening on Sunday while I was out with a friend.  I was having dinner at the mall and he called me up on my cell.  He's really so irritating!  It's like everything would depend on my coming to work on Monday when in fact there really nothing urgent to do in this stupid office.  So, just to pacify him and to make him shut up I told him I'll try to come before lunch.  But I got more pissed when he acted shocked and told "you're coming here before lunch?!" like before lunch is too late for him and that I should come earlier than that.  Can you see how selfish he is? I mean how can I finish enrolling earlier than "before lunch".  That's the time when I really wanted to leave this stupid job and just get out of here.  Too bad, it's just not my style to leave and succomb to my temper. Well, it turned out that I just have to reserve a slot for myself in the Program and that the enrollment is on Friday (they said it's only tentative date).  Gosh! I've never studied in a public school all my life and I think it sucks.   I don't mean the education, I mean the system of enrolling and some other stuff.  So, I got to office at 11 AM and there was really nothing there that requires my immediate attention except his stupid personal emails.  The reason why he needs me to get there is bcoz he's just immobile and can't do anything at all.  I really understand why he needs me there you know, but he should understand too that my work is not my life!  And I'm just asking for one day and he can't even give me one day to take care of my personal matters, esp when I come here on Saturdays (without pay!) as a favor to just help him out with urgent stuff. Gosh!  What an asshole!  So, there you go I'm still a little mad at my boss, he just showed me how selfish and rude he is and he can't do anything to change my opinion of him.  In my eyes, he'll always be self-centered no matter what.  No matter what...coz he's trying to be nice to me again since last Monday when I came back.  But I was never the type who pretends to like you but does not.  When I don't like you, that's it, I don't like you.  I never try to be diplomatic or anything.  I just don't feel like talking to you anymore and I can't stand you and I don't think your jokes are funny anymore.  I'm just irritated with you with everything that you're doing.  And that's what he is to me...he is irritating and not funny anymore.  I really tried to be nice and patient with him no matter how rude he is sometimes, but I guess there'll always be a limit on how much you can take.  Now, I'm just being civil and polite and nothing more.

       before i go... Ryan came back after 1 1/2 hours, but I decided not to be mad at him for that.  I'm just in the mood for a fight and I don't wanna spoil my day.  I guess I made the right decision coz it's like when you did something good to him, whatever it is you do next...like make him wait or something...he just can't afford to get mad at you.  So, when I said brb and came back after 30 mins or so he didn't get mad at me.  He just told me if it's some sort of revenge, but he didn't get mad.  I guess he couldn't coz I would hvae brought up the fact that I waited for him for 1 1/2 hrs.  So, he'll just lose in the argument. =) Anyways, I'm happy coz he was so sweet in chat and it made me believe in our love again.  Coz I was just having this thought that he's not giving me enough attention, but he chatted with me for another half an hour when I asked him not to go to bed yet.   He does love me and what a happy happy day for me!  I just hope he'll be consistent...knowing him, I don't think so. =)

      i'm sad again =( he was late for 30 mins.  Ok, I guess he came earlier than he used to which is 9:30-10 AM, but still...I told him to come at 8 AM and he came at 8:30.  He said he was in the shower (Jeffy was trying to be the devil's advocate and told me "so, shower is more important than you"). Anyway, we were having fun chatting but this had to happen .....   janu: just a sec, got a phone call ice_crystals_24: no no ice_crystals_24: ok janu: hey jan janu: its my uncle, they r callin me for a min ice_crystals_24: really  janu: ya ice_crystals_24: for a minute? ice_crystals_24: how long would that be? janu: might be a little more than min ice_crystals_24:  janu: and later, i have to go with my bro too ice_crystals_24: ok ok ice_crystals_24: so u think we can still chat? janu: ya ice_crystals_24: when would that be? janu: ill be back real quick, i promise wont start eatin there ice_crystals_24: okey ice_crystals_24: just make it lesser than 30 mins ice_crystals_24: ok? janu: ya i think that enough janu: tnxs janu: love u and miss u ice_crystals_24: i'll be counting the mins janu:  ice_crystals_24:  janu: ok sillo janu: brb ice_crystals_24: love u too  And off he goes (sob...sob...).

       the after effect =)  I'm sooooo happy this morning!  I talked to ryan last night and we had the most wonderful conversation we have ever had.  I guess I was exaggerating a bit but that's how I felt it is.  We really didn't talk about anything relevant but it was just fun.  I was in bed then I called him up before I went to sleep.  He answered on the 2nd ring, which is pretty unusual if you know him...coz he's always been the busy type and most of the time he can't get his call.  Anyways, it was memorial day and he was off to the mall to buy some cleaning stuff (I teased him about this a lot...I just find it funny).  He was dricing so I tld him I'll just call him some other time, but he told me he's stopping the car so we can talk.  Then, we talked and talked and it's so pleasant and we laughed a lot and tease each other and play.  I was thinking, if this is how it's gonna be between us then I wanna be with him all the time.  I asked him if he could sing for me and he sound so cute with his almost whinny voice.  He told me he can't and I believe that he really can't sing coz I can't sing too and I know how he feels.=) But I'm not letting him off the hook that easily so I teased some more and plead him to sing for me plzzzzzzzz...maybe he can do it on my birthday...at last he agreed to sing for me. Hehe!  He asked me to sing for him too on his birthday...no prob coz he'll sing for me first since his b-day is month after mine. =)  The conversation ended with the silly kisses again..there's a new one which is we do it together...really silly but it's fun being silly with the one you love.*big grin*

       hey it's my birthday yesterday Yesterday was a totally extreme day.  I was sooooo happy in the morning then everything messed up the afternoon.  I was soooooo happy coz I chatted with ryan and we don't fight anymore now.  It's like we understand each other more now after we had that thing last Monday.  Anyways, I wanted to tell you that my honey sang "happy birthday" for me twice!!! I can't believe he gave in to my request. I really really love him so much.  As for the bad part...it's about Imee (she got me into trouble!) and the other one is I went home without my family at home I had to stay at my aunt's house till they get back (!).  What a day!  And I was so happy in the morning.  Anyways, I can handle any problem as long as it's not about me and ryan.  Nothing is worst than that.  I just love him so much!  Okies.  Happy Birthday to me!  I'm finally 25! I don't know whether to be happy or not.  I think I wanna be happy. =)

       my birthday gift from janu It's not like I'm a sucker for gifts, but the gift that ryan gave me was sooooooooooo wonderful!  He gave me my fave perfume CD's J'Adore and a cd of his fave love songs and a card.  But it's not what really counts.  What really counts is the thought behind all the gifts.  I mean he really took the time to buy me these gifts and burned a cd for me.  Oh so sweet my janu.    I'm soooooo happy today too coz I had a great time chatting with him today.  We were so sweet coz we're okey again.  Love is always sweeter after a fight.  When he got in this morning he told me he haven't taken a shower yet and he asked me to read his email.  He was so serious so I got nervous.  Well, he was angry in his email but I don't know why I found it funny and I felt happy.  Maybe it's coz I finally found out what he didn't like about what I said and I'm glad coz he let go of his thoughts. Anyways, he told me that he looks at my pic once in a while whenever he's not busy. Ain't that sweet? Oh God, I really love him! He's so perfect for me!  I feel like the luckiest girl in the world!  Now, what would I get for him of his birthday??? Hmmmm.....

       time to blog again Looks like ryan is trying to make-up for what he did, but not really make-up.  It's sort of a not-too-obvious way of making-up coz he didn't forget to send me gudnyt and morning kisses although it was kind of a little "cold"...or maybe he trying to make it look that way.  It's just that the kisses are a little shorter and messages are short too.  Anyway, I can see that he truly loves me so I'm not gonna be greedy and be discontented.  At least he didn't tell me to get lost.  He even told me that hope I get his gift soon.  So, he has a gift? I wonder what is it.  Hmmmmm....  I was working on my webpage yesterday and I still don't know how to link and stuff.  I'll find out more about designing eventually.  I just have to be patient.  I just wanna know how to make "links".  I still haven't found out how to do it here.  I hope I can even put pics here or change templates.    Thw Williams sisters are the best!  I just found out that they got in the semis for the French Open.  I hope it will be another sibling match in the finals, just like the US Open.  Pretty exciting, but then Serena has to beat Jennifer Capriati, who is one hell of a player too!  The comeback queen.

       too much love will kill you The song doesn't exactly talk about where I am now, it's just the line "too much love will kill you" that I can relate to.  I really love ryan so much that it's becoming a bad thing.  Too much of something will always be bad.

       this thing called love Ryan and I had a fight again.  We don't actually have those "big fights" but still it's a fight coz we have something we haven't agrred on.  And as usual, it is always him who leaves the room first.  I dont know how he can do that you know.  Say love u and just leave the room.  I mean I can't do it coz it's like you have this attachment in the room and I can't just leave just like that.  I never do something like that coz I know I'll feel terrible afterwards.  But ryan can do that and he did it the last time we chatted (my last post) and today.  And it's just something about the stupid pic that I have asked from him few months back. It's kind of selfish and unfair you know coz everytime he doesn't like the subject he just leaves.  He told me if I continue talking about pic he'll just keep quiet.  Do I have to follow his every whims and wishes?  It's like I don't have a choice but to do as he please.  I'm in very deep pain right now coz I don't wanna lose him, but I just felt that I've spoiled him too much now.  I mean I made him get used to my bowing down to all his wishes.  If he can't talk to me about pic then I don't know what we'll do in more serious situations.   Will he keep leaving everytime he doesn't like the topic?  I really love him, but if I keep on being a martyr and spoil him some more then I'm the one who'll get hurt in the end.    I was still saying something to him when he left and I doubt if he got what I said coz there was no reply.  So, I thought maybe I should teach him a little lesson to make him realize how important I am to him.  I feel like he's taking me for granted now.  Maybe I'm too submissive, too available I'm becoming such a bore to him.  No more challenge.  I've decided not to come online tomorrow and I hope I have the strenght to do that.  I just want him to worry about me coz he has become so sure of himself.  It's like even if he leaves abruptly or something, I always end up apologizing to him and being there for him the next day.  But today, I've had enough.  It's can't go on like this.  I can't be there for him the next day after the way he treated me today.    I even sent him an sms after he left and asked him if he's happy now but he didn't reply.  I erased his number instead.  I'm not gonna apologize to him this time.  If he's trying to show me he's the boss around here then fine, but I didn't do anything wrong so I'm not apologizing this time.  I even turned off my phone.  I hope everything I'm doing wouldn't backfire and push him farther away instead of make him miss me more.  I can't bear that.  One more thing, when I got online today at 9:23 A.M., I saw him already online and he didn't send me an sms to tell me he's online.  He just stayed there and waitied.  I just hope that he's not chatting there with some other girl coz I would just die if he'll find another girl and break up with me. =(

      Oh God! I'm sooo dead! My problem is not yet over! Waaaaa..... There's a memo from the Head of Security for my co-worker coz of that problem I had with the visitor.  I was trying to keep it from her coz she just talks too much!  That's why I told my boss directly about it! I thought I was over and one with...I didn't know there was one final blow!!!

      i saw a blog that have "almost" the same title as mine.=)  anyways, i'm so glad my problem is OVER! i'm so relieved! as for ryan, i'm kinda disappointed coz i asked for his password but he doesn't want to give it to me=(. i know he's not cheating on me or anything, but i just wanna know how open he is to me.   He told me he has two girl penfriends...one from Iran and another from Pk...but he's not interested with them (I know that!).  I don't doubt him anyway.  I'm gauging how close we really are to each other.

       It's all my fault! I woke up at 4:50 AM (my cellphone's time) and saw that jan has a message for me.  I thought it was just one of those good morning message for me, but it's not.  He told me he over slept missed his class and his exam too.  His exact wordes were "I got up late jan, missed class & I had a test today.  I missed everything.  I dunno what's going to happen now.  Just feeling a little down. Miss u.".  It's such a sweet message but I felt bad after reading it coz it's my fault that he overslept, I didn't let him go imme when he told me he's going to bed.  But I'm happy too that he tells me these things and thinks about me when he's feeling down...just like he's the first person I turn to when I'm down. *purrrring with contentment*  Well...it doesn't mean though that I'm not gonna do anything about it.  I don't wanna ruin his studies for the sake of my own satisfaction.  I mean, it can be hard but I'm gonna let him go early from now on.  I'll let him go as soon as he tells me he's goin to bed or maybe when I think it's time for his bedtime, depends on how busy he was that day.  Ohhhh, my honey. To think that I feel that he doesn't love me but he's giving up so much for me.  He didn't even blame me for this. :(  He's soooo perfetc (no matter how much he denies it!).

      What a day!  Why is it my day seems to go wrong when I'm not talking to my honey or when I don't get any morning kiss from him?  He was late today for more than 2 hours....He told me he went to the mall with his mom and sis.  Anyway, he made up for it coz he didn't go to dinner and instead just chatted with me....=)  I have my period and the pain is soooo terribel...then the burger that I ate for breakfast have a half-cooked patti!  I was so pissed off!  But everything is okey now...thanks to my jan.  He made it well for me again. =)

      Have you noticed lately that I never put any heading or title on my blog anymore?  That's coz I can't find the apt title for my daily boring blogs.  But I'll put a title again if I feel like it...but not now.  I'm just soooo happy today and other people might find my blog too boring.  Coz I've noticed that friends starts to get bored with you when you start blabbing your lovelife esp. if you can't find anything wrong with it.  I mean it seems like they are more interested to hear about it if you're unhappy or angry.  But now I'm just so contented.  I just hope nothing bad happens coz I don't believe in a perfect world where you can be happy forever.  I guess my lovelifes happiness compensates well for my career's unhappiness.  What the heck, I'd rather be unhappy in my work than in my personal life.  Last Friday, I went out with my two friends from way back in High School and watched a movie - 40 days and 40 nights.  It's pretty funny in a horny or sexual kind of way...soem things I've seen in the movie I didn't know about but some stuff I already know.  But do all guys really masturbates?  My friends told me they have to let their fluieds out one way or another coz it's bad for the health.  But I can't imagine my ryan masturbating and I don't think he does.  Anyways, they told me they "release" it when they have wet dreams too.  Well, what the heck, I don't think they know it too.  We're all just guessing I guess.  On Saturday, I was on my way to my first day of class but I got l ended up eating pizza with my mom and sis at the mall.  I told them I would just go there later...it really doesn't matter if I'm late.  I kinda lost interest in it after my mom said something discouraging about my taking that course during breakfast.  I even ended up crying.  I'm such a cry baby.  I hate it that I cry immediately when I'm mad or hurt or sad like I have no control over my tears.  I even cry at the bus sometimes!  So there, I went to school late but it turned out that we still don't have classes.  The 3 of us high school chums met again...I'm kinda getting tired of going out with the same people now. =)   Anyways, something really nice happened on Sunday.  I was feeling so low maybe coz of that talk I had with one of my guy friends.  I mean he said some stuff which made me real feel bad.  I felt like such a loser and stupid and I just felt like I have a bleak future and that's I'm doomed and i have nothing to look forward to. =(  I'm so sad and it's such a heavy feeling eventhough I just woke up.  I have to cut the para short coz here's the best part....  I decided to sms ryan and told him that I feel so bad and low and asked  him to sms me or something to cheer me up...never really expecting that he'll take "the bad feeling" seriously.  But he did and he told me he was about to sms me and say good morning but he said he doesn't know what to do to make me feel better.  Then I sms him some more to explain what I felt, but instead of smsing me back, he just gave me a call.  My janu...he's so sweet.  I can't get over it untill now.  Swanny told me he thinks it's true love when a person can always make u feel better when ur sick or depressed.  Well, I think it is and I've realized that I have such a PERFECT boyfriend and I'm so lucky.  God, I love him so much more now (if that's possible) and more and more each day.  And what makes it even sweeter is that he really loves me too and he's concern about me.  He's such a gift from God.  Now that his family is staying with them (him and his brother), we only got to chat for 3 hours but I'm still happy coz he still thinks about me all the time.  Like I think about him too all the time.  I have never never been this happy and light in my whole life.  I just hope that "final call" he's referring to will have a positive result and that they'll let him marry me, a Catholic.  I guess that will be our biggest hurdle.  All relationships has and this is ours - I guess nothing is ever perfect.  But I know we'll try to make everything work...I hope he will more since he has more things to overcome than mine.  He told me too that his family has arranged for him to marry one of his cousins.  I just hope our love is strong enough to get over this.  He told me though that he's willing to live someplace far from the cruelties of the world or those people who'll shun us.    I really love him, my perfect janu, so I'm gonna do everything in my power to be with him forever.

      Hungry...hungry...I wanna go to the mall and splurge.  Eat some roast chicken or spicy fried chicken or french fries and ice cream! Gosh! This is soooooo hard.  But I have to lose pounds...in the name of love.  Im happy anyway so its not a problem with me.  Ryan sent me an sms last night and he doesnt think I'm overreacting.  He overreacted too.  Hehe... He is so amazing and so wonderful! I dont think I'll find someone like him and I dont think I will look for his replacement.  No way. =)   I hope my colleague's boss would let her go now so that we can go to the mall watch a movie and finally....EAT! I'm so starving!  I thought they said you'd get used to dieting after 3 days.  How come I'm still getting hungry right now???  Is hunger really a part of dieting?!  Ok, gotta run now.  I have to remember...what I'm doing is all in the name of LOVE.  My love for ryan. oxox

      Ouch! My fingers hurt like hell! =(( This is what happened:  I was carrying a pencil on the way out then the pencil kinda hit the door and then it went into my fingers. Its too painful!  There was so much blood when I washed it off at the restroom that I felt I was gonna faint.  Gosh!  Maybe this fainting spell is what dieting do to you.  In a moment of panic, ryan was the first thing I had in mind.  I wanted to call him but he's prolly sleeping so I just sent him an sms.  It's just tooooo paiinful and my right hand felt weak.  Now, I kinda ashame for overreacting and for texting ryan.  I better sms him again and say sorry for freaking out.

      Nothing to say...too tired to say anything.  And this contact lenses is giving me a hard time.  God! I wonder when I can get rid of them.  I was thinking of getting a new one.  This one seems defective.  I had a nice chat with jan today.  He was late coz he had to work late today. :(  But he promised me he'll stay with me as long as I want and he did.  Although its very obvious that he was really getting sleepy.  So, I let him go.  I he already made me feel he loves me anyway.  That's enough.

       Just plain boring I think the title speaks for itself. It's such a boring weekend. I went to watch the movie "Sum of all fears" which is pretty okey, ryan watch minority report.  I was hoping ryan would give me a call but he didn't although we kept on sending sms.  I just wanna be with him right now and forever.  I guess he felt the same way too coz he sent me a sweet email this weekend.  Such a sweet guy..although sometimes he just don't show.  I guess it's a guy thing.   I didn't get to talk to him long today which kinda makes me sad, coz after 2 days of not talking to him I wanted badly to spend time with him.  But I guess he just can't coz some friend called him up before he was able to login this morning (I'll ask him about that tomorrow) and he has to go out with his family too.  So, it's okey although I can't help being melodramatic with him...but just a little coz my boss was talking to me on the phone while we're saying our goodbyes.  So I was pretty distracted.  Darn!  Talk about bad timing!  Hope tomorrow would be better.

      I'm not feeling so good today.  I think I'm coming down with a flu - thanks to my cousin, who passed on this virus to me. :((  Just for the record.  We didn't have the satisfying heart to heart talk I wanted to happen.  I guess ryan is not just in the mood for that.  You have to be in the mood to do that.  But, it's a pretty much good talk though, better than yesterday.  There's one thing though (there's always this one thing when it somes to me! i hate making a big deal out of everything, just never satisfied): he said doesn't love me in a way that he'll give up his organ for me if I need a transplant.  I told him I would, although I guess I won't either.  That's pretty morbid. We came to this coz he asked me if I meant what I said yesterday about "loving him more than myself".  I think I said that coz I don't know what to say anymore. :D  Gotta go.  Have to run now coz I'm just so paced out.  My colds is killing me. :((  I wonder if he can give me a kiss again later tonight (I meant on phone).  I just can't afford to call him. =(

       From this moment... This is Shania Twain's   "From this moment on"   and this is exactly how I feel for ryan.  You know how they say that there is someone out there for each one of us. Our one true love.  Ryan is my one true love.  (I do swear that I'll always be there.  I'd give anything, and everything. And I will always care.  Through weakness and strength, happiness and sorrow.  For better for worse, I will love you  With every beat of my heart.)   From this moment life has begun  From this moment you are the one  Right beside you is where I belong  From this moment on   From this moment I have been blessed  I live only for your happiness  And for your love I'd give my last breath  From this moment on   I give my hand to you with all my heart  I can't wait to live my life with you, I can't wait to start  You and I will never be apart  My dreams came true because of you   From this moment as long as I live  I will love you, I promise you this  There is nothing I wouldn't give  From this moment on   You're the reason I believe in love  And you're the answer to my prayers from up above  All we need is just the two of us  My dreams came true because of you   From this moment as long as I live  I will love you, I promise you this  There is nothing I wouldn't give  From this moment on  I will love you as long as I live  From this moment on

       Is this the beginning of the end? I don't know, but we've been fighting a lot lately.  Is this the "seven year itch" of going steady? I really have no idea.  One minute we're doing fine and the next we're not. This time, it's my turn again.  But no matter how much I say sorry, I just can't get it right.  Ryan is such a puzzle, I dont know what to make out of his moods.  He's so hard that sometimes I feel like he doesn't love me in moments like this.  Is he secure enough in our relationship that he feels that no matter what he does, I'll always forgive him?  Can I do the same? I mean I'm scared that if I do the wrong thing he'll just leave me then and there.  I have become an underdog. =(  This time I asked him to stay until 4 pm (3 am his time) and he said yes.  Then at around 1:30 pm, he told me he has a problem and that he's getting sleepy.  I told him he has to make up for it, whether he sings or he baby-talk with me.  I was just kidding of course.  But I don't know, maybe I just give jokes at the worst moment.  Coz when I said he doesn't keep his promise (which is really in a sweet tone in real sense), he just got "mad" and told me ok fine, if I want him to stay he'll stay.  Then that started it.  I keep saying sorry and every things I know that would make him soft, but I guess his mind is pretty made up.  Nothing I say or do will let him go back to having a good mood again.  He did stay, but he's not in the mood to talk.  But I told him he can go to sleep if he wants to (which I really mean that time coz he's just so sleepy), but he just keep on saying no, he has to keep his promise to someone.  I don't know if this will get worst.  But he's becoming too much of a spoiled brat now.  I really love him and I'm trying to really extend my patience, but I hope he won't really stretch it too much it will burst.  God knows, how much I love him.  I just hope he'll never abuse that knowledge.  I sent him an email again.  I don't know why this always happens, like the table is always turned on me eventhough I don't think I did anything wrong.  But then, when you love someone, that means giving in to the person.  I just hope he doesn't expect me to give in to everything.  You know what my biggest fear is right now? His waking up one day and realizing that our relationship is a big mistake and that this is going no where.  In short, realizing that he had to break up with me.  I'm afraid of that happening to us.  I know I'll never come to the realization, but it's possible he will.  I almost thought that that's what he supposed to say next when he said something about putting up with me.  I just sat here waiting in suspense while the description bar says he's typing something.  I'm like a bomb waiting to explode.  I don't know what I'm gonna do next when that happens.  I really don't.  Jumping out the window seems like the best alternative.

       My ryan, my love I got home yesterday thinking the whole time about ryan...actually, nothing new there.  Coz I'm   always   thing about him.  But this time, I was trying to decide whether to play hardball or just to say sorry.  Maybe I did hurt him by telling him "everything he says is nothing" (that's what he said later although I don't know if he's kidding).  Maybe he was so tired and stressed out which is why he was so sensitive.    I decided not to send him an sms, but at around 9:45pm I broke my resolve and said good morning to him, told him i still love him and asked him if he still loves me too.  But I got no answer from him.  When I still haven't heard from him as I was going to bed, I sent him another sms and asked him if he still doesn't want to talk to me.  And told him that i'll just talk to him if he wanted still to talk to me.  I was already starting to cry.  That's just the way I am...I've become a cry baby.  This time he replied "sorry?".  He's not talking to me until I say sorry and I said I just can't coz I didn't do anything wrong.  Then he told me that maybe I still haven't really accepted his character and asked me how am I going to live with him (I don't remember much but it's basically it). Anyways, to cut to the chase, I finally said sorry to him.  That's after he told me that maybe I just don't love him enough and all that stuff.  I really thought he's trying to break-up with me.  I was feeling panicked already.  He told me he's just trying to see how much I love him, coz he always say sorry when I ask him to.  He wasn't really supposed to reply back but since I started talking about breaking-up and all, he just had to talk.  I guess he does really love me so much.  He told me he loves me more than I ever know and that he's never gonna break up with me ever (remember?).  God! I really love this man.  After he said goodnight, I told him I still don't feel good enough and asked him to call me.  He did...and I had the happiest conversation in my life.  I told him he's so mean for doing that to me and I just can feel that he really loves me.  We talked for 20 minutes and 39 seconds!  And I didn't have to force him to kiss me.  Oh so romantic and fun.  We're really gonna have fun together.  I can tell from the way we talk to each other.  I love him sooooo much.

      I'm so so sad. :( I don't know whether ryan was really mad at me or just teasing me, but he just left without saying i love u to me and fixing everything.  Is he chatting with someone?  I mean he can't just sit there are send me emoticons right?  He has to do some other things too.  And when it's his time to go to bed, he didnt even say goodnight.  I'm so scared...I dont want something like this to happen to us or to me esp.  But if your boyfriend is cheating online, ul know it right??  But I dont think he can do that to me.  I have to trust him on that.  Maybe he's just having a bad day.  I guess it's his turn, but I'm having a bad day too. :((  I sent him an ecard this afternoon, I just can't stand not doin anything.  I sent him this card [http://www.usagreetings.com/cgi-bin/usa_display_card.cgi?occ=love&card=love_wacky_0207_5.gif&bgmusic=auldlang.mid] with this message:    what just happened today? i still dont know what to make out of it...are u just teasing me or r u serious?????? u know i was just kidding. i mean do u seriously think that everything u say is nothing??? if it is, then how come i was so in a hurry to go home yest just to catch that raymond show on tv?      i just can't make myself apologize for something that i didn't even mean. u know that i would have said sorry if i really tot i did something wrong. i always say sorry. but this time, i just cant see anything wrong w/ what i said. and if u want a break from my nagging self, pls dont make up some silly fights just so u dont have to tak to me. just tell me.    i hope u wont get more angry at me after reading this. love u so much eventhough u broke my heart this pm. u didn't even say i love u :(     [are we really gonna be like this couple???]    love u always jan. bye.    What do u think?  Besides, he called me to say he's gonna be late.  Maybe I just got on his nerve for being too demanding. :((  I just hope he still loves me and he has not found someone else. Oh God, I don't think I can bear it. :((:((:((

      God! I'm soooooooo mad! Ryan is such a jerk! I cant believe he wants me to apologize for something that he knows I said as a joke!  What's wrong with him??! Maybe he's having fun chatting with some other girl while he pretends not to talk to me by sending emoticons to me. I even cried coz of this and he's still not stopping it! I'm sooooo pissed off now!

      I feel so depressed right now, just right after ryan left the chatroom.  I wanna cry right now.  For not knowing what the future holds for me and my jan.  Is he really serious about coming to see me in the future?  Is our relationship going somewhere or this will just end up in heartbreak.  I don't know what to do if that happens.  I really really love him.  He's my world.   Actually, it's about a lot of things.  First maybe coz it's dark outside like its gonna rain (or is it already?).  It's depressing the hell out of me.  Then my mom is down with the flu and I really feel bad at that coz she still prepared breakfast for us this morning.  Nothing can really beat a mother's love for her children.  Then there's school which is depressing me a lot coz I dont think I wanna pursue it anymore.  I just don't think it's the right thing for me.  But I'll try to give it a shot and try to make it better.  It's just that I'm not motivated enough.  Besides, my mom isn't to keen about it.  Maybe I'll just do something about my paper.  That will prolly help me feel better.  Too bad fahim is sleeping right now...I need to talk to him right now.  He always makes me feel better when I'm depressed.  I don't know what to do without him.  I feel like crying again.  Actually, I am crying...I'm just trying to stop myself from bursting in tears.  Maybe I should try to put everything in God's hands and not try to make everything my own.  All I ever wanted is love from Fahim and my family.  Money doesn't matter to me.

      It's 14 days more to go before ryan's birthday and still...I don't have the GIFT for ryan! :((  I'm so near panic now!  I better look for someone with a videocam.  He told me that I'm the best gift for him.  So, maybe I'll just make something that's very ME! Pics (of me and views!), a video, and a poem from me!  I have to tap my artistic talent this time....God help me in the name of love! =)

       my mom, the best mom in the world! I guess you can say that I know my body pretty well.  When I said I think I'm coming down with the flu, just right after I got home I'm knocked down in bed.  Even when I was in the bus I was already feeling the chills in my body.  This one is kinda different from the past flus that I got.  This one is like a signal no. 3 typhoon.  It knocked me down for 3 days and even today I still have the colds and the coughs.  There is one bad and one good things though that came out of those 3 days.  The bad part is that I was feeling a little pain in my right breast everytime I cough.  I was hoping that it would go away the next day, but after a day it still didn't.  Then last night I woke up in the middle of the night (12mn) coz the pain in my right breast was so unbearable.  No, amount of tossing and turning will mkae it go away.  So, I just got up and woke up my mom.  I ended up crying so hard in her arms.  This pain scare the hell out of me.  I was thinking all kinds of carzy stuff already like dying young and going to hell and my family and my ryan (whom I haven't even met yet).  It's hard.  It's like all of a sudden I had lots of unfunished business.  I thought I would be happy to die but I wasn't.  There is something to live for after all (this is something I just thought of just now).  Then I kept thinking about the big-C and I thought we'll never be able to afford chemotherapy.  I just don't know why I do this things - think so negatively! I've thought of calling ryan too but I thought it would be silly if I do that coz I'll only be crying the whole time. He might think I'm just looking for sympathy or something.  Anyways, I went to ob gyne this morning and she told that there is indeed a lump on my breast and that it's kinda big, but she asked me to go back after my period.  I just hope everything would turn out well coz I hate being operated on.  I just have never been under the surgeon's knife in my whole 25 yrs life.  The good part is that ryan really really missed me. I think more than I missed him and that's a lot coz I really missed him so much.  But I guess he missed me more, if that's still possible.  I told him about my consultation with the doctor and he told me that everything is gonna be fine and not to think too much about the big-C.  I really love him coz he really cheers me up when I'm down.  I have the feeling that if ever we end up being married, we'll really go a long way.  Come to think of it, I think we're already acting like married couples. =)   There's a hitch though, I just hope that my mom wont take it so badly if I ever marry a Muslim.  Coz she told us the other day that one Muslim in the family is enough, anything more than that she'll be committing suicide. Well, I don't think that she'll reall commit suicide but I know it'll break her heart or something and I would hate to see her very unhappy or disappointed.  I'm glad that ryan told me he'll try to make it in our family something.  Can't remember exactly, but I like it that he calls my mom his mom-in-law (hehe!) and that he wanted to make my family like him.  As for his family, I don't think that will ever be possible. =(  Anyways, back to my mom, I really think she's the best mom in the world and now I'm feeling guilty coz I (and sometimes my sisters) don't even help her with the chores.  I mean she did our laundry the whole day yesterday and cooked for us too and washed the dishes.  Then she went with me to the doctor and she went home alone.  Poor mom.  From now on, I'm really gonna make it better for her.  I really love her so much and I want her to be happy too!

      I don't know what's wrong with my blog...but what the heck, I'll keep blogging.  Maybe it will get well in its own time.  Anyways, I don't know what's wrong with me and ryan but we're really getting horny.:D  Our talk is getting braver and more sexy.  Yesterday I told him I have small blah blah, then he told me this morning that he loves girls with small blah blah.lol  Then he told me I better hurry taking a bath and that he's next.  I told him why not join me and that maybe he has a small blah blah too.  He told me he doesn't thats why he shouldn't come in.:D  It's horny but I LOVE IT!  I just hope he likes my gift coz he told me he thinks tight-fitting shirts and jeans are cheap.  And I gave him a fitting shirt!  What to do! =((

      I'm leaving in 5 mins so I have to hurry.  I'm getting a little lazy with this blogging thing.  I've neglected my diary at home for so long I think I want to write there tonight and put down my thoughts and fears about ryan.  I have lots and those are not for public consumption.  I'm still not so comfy with sharing very very innermost thoughts with everyone.  Besides, I'm thinking of showing this blog to ryan one day.  I hope. Have to go now.

      Yesterday was the local election here.  So the rest of the populace were off from work...except us, who have to come here for half of the day.  That's always the way we are here...coz it's an international institution.  So, we only have holidays that are internationally acknowledge.  Anyways, I still got to chat with ryan so I don't have any problem with coming to work.  Although we had to cut out chat short and ended at exactly 1pm.  Sometimes, it goes on until 1:30pm or even 2pm.  But this time, I really have to go coz I really have no other time to find a gift for his birthday.  So, we went to Glorietta, w/c is the only place left with lots of potentials.  That is, after going to the Mega and Shang.  We found the pjs which my friend thinks is sexy...altho i don't think it's sexy anymore now.  It's really hard to look for a gift if you have limited budget...esp if your currenc is the poor little peso.  So, all I got was a cottom pj and shirt which is said to be sexy.  I just don't have the eye for sexiness...coz I just suck when it comes to gifts for guys.  In fact, this is the first time that I'm gonna give a gift to my bf.  My past relationships just didn't last long to have any of them celebrate their birthdays with me. =) Well, I'm glad for that.  Coz that means this is special and first times are supposed to be special.  I just feel so relieved now that I found a gift at last! *sigh*  It's giving me nightmares already and stressing me out.lol  But I know it's not yet over, coz I still have to find out if he'll like it or not. Yikes!  I hope he'll like it coz it really means so much to me.  And I'm not one who takes negative criticisms lightly.  It always affects me too much. =(    Another thing I worry about is the cost for mailing.  I can't believe that mailing it is as much expensive as the gift...not to mention that I have to spend the same amount for calls too.  Having a bf is soooooo expensive!  But I think it's all worth it. ;)  I just hope that this is gonna last like we've planned.  I just suck when it comes to relationships.  If you leave it all to me, we would have broken up long time ago.  Coz I just end up thinking that we're breaking up everytime we have a fight or something.  Thank goodness coz ryan just don't think that its the solution. =)  Well.....I guess he's really worth all the effort and the expenses. :D  Speaking of expenses...He told me that he was thinking about that while ago and that he tot he can't give me anything that's best in this world coz he just can't afford it.  It's so sweet of him to think that way.  That means he has tot about the future too as much as I do.  Poor jan, he's really worried that he'll let me live in poverty if ever we ended up together.  Ya, money is important but I'm not after too much money.  I just want enough money to survive.  I hope he sees that there's really nothing to worry about as long as we're together.  I'm not really the type who'll try to live beyond our means.  I'm a sensible spender althought I spend too much at times, but I just know my limitations.  I really love him so much and he has given me a reason to try to focus on my life again.  I just lost the motivation to strive hard.  Thanks to him, I think I better try to make something out of my life.  Oh God, I just wanna spen the rest of my life with him.  That's all that matters to me.

      It's ryan big day and I'm glad I had the chance to call him coz I didn't realize that the card I bought was for home phone.  He told me he doesn't have a phone at home..I wonder what's that phone he used to call me.  I think I'll ask him about it tomorrow or else I'll never be satisfied.  He gave me his pics and he added one more to it... he really loves to surprise me any way he can. I love him so much.

      Today is a nice day for me, except that ryan had a headache.  Poor baby. It's my fault I guess, coz i made him stay until almost 5pm (4am his time) yesterday.  Then he had to wake up at 6am for school. Anyways, he told me it's all coz of those nachos he ate last sat.  He ate like one box with 40-60 nachos. lol  And there's good news too...he said he's giving me 2 more pics on his b-day.  I wonder how it looks like :) but I'm pretty excited.  Do I need to tell u that?? =) I'm just grinning from ear to ear right now.

      I'm soooooo sad...I felt like I ust broke up with ryan when truth is he just needs time to do some stuff.  But he told me we cant chat anymore now, just once a week. :(  I've never realized how important he is to me till now.  I have grown so attached to him that I can't be without him even for a day. :(( I can't breathe and it feels like my heart is gonna break. :((  I hope he's not planning to break up with me or something.  You know...soften the blow or whatever. :(  I just love him so. :(

      There are so much to talk about but so little time. I'm having my fibrodenoma taken out tomorrow and I'm really scared.  I always imagine this small knife cutting through my flesh.  Oh God!!!=(( Another thing is the "thing" here at work with my boss...I think I finally settled that prob...then there's ryan ryan and ryan.  I don't know what to think anymore.  I wanted to truct him but I guess I'll never be able to trust a man "completely".  There will always be that little voice inside my head.  Anyways, I would have to be strong coz that's waht he wanted about me...there's no use being a whinny.  It'll only make matters worst.  In fact, I always end up waking him early in the morning bugging him whether he still loves me or not.  It's really pretty silly.  I can't help it...I get that way when I'm depressed.  Okey, got to go now... I still have to prepare that report for Saturday.  I've postponed it too much already.  I wonder if I really need this operation or maybe they can just give me some medicines to make it disappear or something.  Oh well....que sera sera...I guess I'll be bugged forever if they dont take it out.  Tah tah everyone! Btw, thanks for that chap who emailed me.  I thought my blog was some kind of "invisible element" on the net.  There's really nothing to it but all about ryan blah blah blah...lol

      I think I lost my motivation to write...I've become too much of a slacker.  I don't even write on my diary anymore. I wonder if this is just a phase. I hope so! But then maybe it's coz I gained weight(?). I  get very lazy everytime I gain a few pounds...that's how I know that I have gotten fatter.  Is there such a word as "fatter"?lol   I'm looking forward to talking to ryan today.  I hope he won't disappoint me. Though I talked to him for almost as hour yest on the phone, I just can't get enough.  Maybe coz we don't talk in a horny way. *wink*  He is such a very "un" talkative guy. I do all the talking and he does all the ya no ya thing.  Well, uhm...actually, that's always the case everytime I talk to guys.  I just go on and on and on.  Can u believe I used to send my ex-bf 2 or 4-paged letters everytime he dodes something that really pisses me off?  I don't think he reads it anyway. Guys just dont like nagging girlfriends, much more read loooong "nagging" letters!  I don't either.  My colleague just called up.  She told me she can't come to work coz of some flu....she gave me a mega explanation as if I'm her boss.  Don't u think she should as permission from our head instead of asking me to tell our boss???  It's just a phonecall away anyway.  Well..(sigh)...I guess that's the way she is.  She makes me crazy sometimes and I can't do anything about it coz she's older than me (40 something!) which means I can't yell at her if ever I get too frustrated.  I always try to respect those who are "older" than me no matter how stupid they are sometimes. =((  Now...I'm getting irritated.  Btw, where's that ryan??! x-(

      My day would have been perfect (well...almost perfect) if my officemate were not giving me the cold shoulder.  I don't know what's wrong with me lately but I've become so tactless nowadays.  I mean I have always been frank but frankness is a little bit difference from being tactless.  Ok, which one I should tell you first? My officemate or my being tactless in many instances?  Let me tell you first about this friend/officemate of mine.  I don't have any friends here at work, both of us don't so we ended up together.  We kinda opposites but we get along well.  But sometimes I can't tolerate her being too I don't know how you call it but she laughs at people's "imperfections" all the time that somtimes I think it's too much already.  Its kinda ironic actually coz she keeps on saying that she's ugly and everything and keeps complaining about how she looks but she laughs at how people look too. Anyways, she has had relationships before, two to be exact but both she met through text messaging.  She met her first boyfriend in person though but for the second one, she knew him for a year and still haven't met him.  There's also another guy she changes sms whom she kinda like but haven't met too.  So, she's kinda "inlove" with two guys.  She told me frankly that what she's after is that the guy should be rich.  That's where we're different.  Well, she smsed with this guy for a year until eventually he became her bf.  But they broke up (he broke up with her), and she later found out that this guy has all along been lying to him about his name and maybe aout having brain cancer and dying and eveything.  She also found out that he has a girlfriend.  Isn't that very stupid of her?  I mean you can never be ignorant of something for a year.  That's long enough for you to find out if he's lying or not.  Then, there's this guy she met over the net.  He's from Norway but he's half Iranian too.  I admit, I feel jealous that this guy calls her almost eveyday and wakes up for even at the wee hours of the morning, but what I don't like is that she keeps on bragging about it.  it's like she's indirectly telling me that this guy is much much better than my ryan in terms of looks and money-wise.  She told me that this guy offered to buy her a cellphone and that he's coming over this month...etc.  Being the "last laugh" type that I am, I decide to chat with this guy and try to find out how much sincere and devoted he is to her, coz she told me that this guy was telling her he loves and her and that he doesn't chat with anyone anymore and all that stuff.  Then she bragged also about the fact the this guy told her that he never had a gf before ever.  As I've planned, I've pmed this guy in my newlycreated id and asked him if I knew him coz he was on my friends list.  I tot he was not gonna answer coz ryan used to ignore anyone who tries to chat with him.  But this guy did and told me "maybe".  Isn't that an expression of interest or what?  So, I chatted with him and at first he doesn't seem interested but I tried to be really charming and I guess he liked me a little in the end.  He asked  for my number and I've talked to him twice so far.  Too bad I had to use my other number all the time and not the number I gave him.  I've talked to him for a short while once and then during the second time we lasted for about 40mins.  I guess I was successful in my mission.  But the problem is how I can get to see him coz I want him to lose his interest on this stupid friend of mine.   Ok, what really piqued her I guess is because she asked me why guys keep on fooling her and I told her that maybe they can see through her.  when she asked me what I meant I told her that it must be because they know that she's not very sincere to them.  It's because she keeps on changing her mind.  it's like you'll be ahead of the game if you gave the most expensive gift or you have the biggest account or whatever.  She keeps on telling me that she's inlove with this and that but when the other one comes around, she fogets about the old one.  I really don't like girls like that.  Tha's why I keep fighting with my other friend in the province.  They just cant seem to make up their mind and they seem to want to have it all.  Anyways, I guess she got mad with what I said and told I shouldn't judge her coz I don't know her that well yet.  Well, that's bullshit coz I know her enough to know that I was right.  She's very materialistic and she laughs at peoples appearance and judge people according to how rich they are and all those earthly stuff.  That was yesterday and until now we havn't talked much the way we used to.  Well, I tried to be nice to her by telling her I was going home yesterday but she ignored my sms this morning although she said morning to me.  Well, whatever.  I don't care.  I just hate her too much right now.  Btw, ryan knows that I flirted with this guy on chat but I haven't told him about the phonecalls though.  I just don't think it's necessary.  Anyways, the guy is a liar too.  And so is the girl...she's only after the phone he's gonna give her.  What a world!!!

      After attending mass yesterday afternoon, I felt a little lighter. God never fails to help at tiems like this. Thanks to Him for whatever good that has happened since then. I know he'll help me, coz I know Janu was an answer to my prayers.  Well, there are some instances tho that I felt like crying. I just can't take it that I'm gonna lose my love all over again.  If there's one phobia that I have, it's breaking up.  I don't wanna feel that kind of pain all over again....EVER! If I have to move mountains to work this out, I will. (well, I just hope I can move mountains though)  We're kinda okey again after talking this morning. "Kinda" coz I'm still not walking on clouds after talking to him. I still have this nagging feeling inside me that he's hiding something from me to keep me from getting hurt. [Dear God, I hope I'm wrong. PLEASE!] Another thing is that, we still haven't come up with a concrete plan on how are we gonna see each other.  I offered my help to him that I'll shoulder some of his fare and hotel expense but he refused.=( I guess it's a pride thing, but I wish he did coz I really wanna help him and I think I could save and afford it if I really need to. I just wanna see him soon!  I'm really scared about what I'm feeling. I feel like I've gone beyond the deepest hole...or is it the peak of whatever is the tallest? Coz I'f afraid that if I'm gonna fall this time, I'll prolly be close to dying coz I just can't face life with him at all! I don't know what he's thinking though but I guess he does love me if he wants to waste his time chatting with me.  But...(here comes) there's something about what he said that was hurtful. He said something like:  Me: i was talking about not getting any sms every morning Janu: u were Janu: :p Me: yah what else  Me: i think u do it on purpose [-( Janu: time ill give u mornin kiss, im here Janu: i dont have to waste any sms Me: so ur just wasting sms on me? Janu: kinda Me: gee tnx Me: im just a waste of time, money and effort Janu: thats explains all Me: ok Me: then ur prolly wasting ur time right now with me Janu: well i am wastin my time anyways  Isn't that painful to hear? That he doesn't want to waste his money on you. Not to mention his time although "he's already wasting his time anyways [not chatting with me]".  I have to get to the bottom of this or else I'll go CRAZY! I don't know why I'm like this. It's too hard for me to just believe it when someone tells me he loves me no matter what he does.  For me, it's like it's not enough.=( It's all coz of my stupid ex, who refused to take me back eventhough he clearly still loves me. x-( That jerk! He's ruining all my chances at happiness! I hope janu will be patient with me when I ask him this later tonight.  I was supposed to do it on email, but, I can't wait that long. I might not be able to go to sleep coz of this u know. I wish I could change this attitude. I'm so hooked on to love...i hate it...but I can't help it!  I guess that's all for now. I lost 1.1 lbs in a week (based on my recent measurement).  I have a reason to do it now.  I have to get myself in-shape again so he'll think twice about dumping me (not that it's a major issue, but it might help. Who knows?). So that's for now.  Btw, I forgot to put this song by Luther Vandross on my blog yesterday when I was really feeling down. I feel that I can relate to this specific part!   I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart I'd rather have the one who holds my heart.

      I hate to think that what janu and i are experiencing right now is the beginning of the end. i just can't bear it! =(( i think i'l die...or i think i'd rather die than have a second heartache all over again! this time it's worse coz i've been with him "online" for more than a year!!! my ex and i were together for only two months and it took me 4 years to recover! how much more now when i feel that janu is my one great love and i really really love him above anything else! =(( Oh God, please don't take him away from me. i beg you, please! =(

      The title could mean two different things. It could mean that I think I've lost my janu  forever  or it's refering to what I'm feeling right now.  It seems that lately, we have done nothing but argue and fight. I'm usually the one who starts it but it doesn't mean that it's all my fault. I just can't help but feel that he has changed somehow...or did I? I don't know.  All I know is that I'm not happy about the way things are going.  Like for instance yesterday, I asked him to wake me up at 5:30 am and he didn't.  To make matters worst is he didn't even sms me and apologized for not waking me up, nor did he say good morning to me.  Then, he came online late like 11 am and just to say goodnight coz he's feeling sick.  Whether it is true or not I don't know.  But, it was a Sunday on his side, so I dunno why he can be late.  He told me he was at work.  I was really in a fighting mood that time but he said it's not the right time coz he had to go to bed early since he has work the next day.  He also told me that he'll be pretty late today coz he has class already.  Anyways, I was really mad at him that time that I decided not to sms him that night.  And I didn't. The he sent me this msg about not getting any miscol nor sms and how he's such a poor kid. Knowing how much bad tempered I am, you prolly have an idea what happened next. I told him I was just not in the mood to give any affection right now coz I'm disappointed in our relationship. I guess he got mad too which is why he said "fine".  Then the rest is history. Couple of sms later...I told him to say a proper goodnight instead of saying  bye  (I can't believe he said bye!) and asked him to give me a kiss and a hug.  But he didn't, maybe he's really mad already coz he just said  goodnight  then nothing.  Not even a simple   ilu  ! So I got hurt and I want to hurt him too so I said  u r such a mean jerk !   So, there goes...and now? I already have a feeling that he's never gonna come online today.  After what happpened, I'm pretty sure about that.  But, I was still hoping though although right this moment at 2:21 pm...that hope is crushed.  There's no way he's still coming.  The big question is whether that's for good.  I hope it's not coz it's gonna kill me. =(  Now, I feel like I'm lost coz I dunno what to think or feel. I'm not even crying! But I feel like I'm gonna go crazy though. Oh God, please let him understand.  I still really love him eventhough I'm mad at him.  Really miss you my janu. =((

      I forgot my phone at home, so, I had to call up my sis to tell me if I got any msg from anyone (actually, just Jan..hehe!) and she said I did. I had to tell her how to open it and looking who it's from without actually reading my msg. I had to bear with her teasing, but I just had to know...I have to. So, after knowing that I got a msg from him I started to go through my business at work happily. That's all I cared about. My phone has only one more space for msgs since it's all full of Jan's msgs and I would have told my friend, MEl, not to send me msgs if I haven't received any msg (yet) from Jan. He is my priority and she has to make way for him, even at my phone.  I kept wondering though what he told me in his msg since it's 10:30 and he's not yet online. I wonder if he smsed me that he can't come online or if he's gonna be late or whatever. So, I ended up calling him from here and I have expected him not to reply since he told me he doesn't reply when he's busy (like he did couple of times). But, well, I guess life with him is just full of surprises. He answered my call (he actually had to get out of class to do it which is kinda sweet!) and we talke for a few minutes. I had to let him go back to class, right? ya..ya..I'm grinning from ear to ear. Not to forget he gave me a kiss, right in their school hallway, although nobody's there, but whatever, I'm just happy thanks to him.  Tomorrow, I'm not coming to work since I have tons of researching to do to catch up and prepare my report. Then I also need to get my transcript and good moral then give my down payment to Doods for the nokia 7650 I'm buying from his friend. I hope he's not going to swindle me or anything. I can't wait...I'm so excited. I have to convince Jan to get an MMS-enabled phone too so that we can send pics all the time.   Speaking of day-off, I had a hard time asking permission from my boss (as usual!) but when my mind is set, he can't stop me. Besides, I have to come up with a good research or else my classmate (whom I kinda think he's too smart) would think I'm stupid. It means a lot to me that people think I'm stupid and gives me the respect that I want. That makes me sound insecure right? Jan told me it's an ego thing and that he likes it. Maybe we really are not as opposite as we think we are (personality wise).=)

      Just finished talking to Jan on the phone 10mins ago and well...you know how that guy influences my mood. Nobody can make me sa happy (or as sad) as I am now except my one and only loooooooove (drool). After coming back from lunch, I still didn't get any sms from him and neither is he online! Then finally after several minutes I got an sms from him telling me that just as he was about to come online, the power went off (I hope it's not some kind of bad sign!). Well, I hate to admit that I kinda doubt him to I asked him if I can call him now, just to make sure if he really is at home and wants to talk to me (well, I didn't tell him exactly THAT! He kill me!). So, I called him up and we talked...and talked...and went on for almost an hour (my boss is gonna kill me when he finds out!). I told him I'm using my boss' account and he told me it's okey and that maybe my boss wouldn't mind. I guess we really are the same more than we know.lol Then I told him that this co-worker of mine showed me a catalog to buy something and I told him I don't wanna buy anything from someone I don't like esp that Cynthia! I don't know if I've told you about her before but she is beyond me....gosh! One blog is not enough to tell you much much of a ******* whatever she is! Jan asked me why I don't wanna buy anything even if I really want that something, then I told him coz I don't want her to be happy or satisfied coz I dont like her. Jan told me it's bad and I thought oh my, I've been to honest with him he might get turned-off by me. ood thing he told me (after some nudging from me) that maybe others would think I don't have a good attitude, but he likes me and see nothing wrong with it. Oh, he's such a sweety!  I dunno if he's just teasing me or whatever but he told me he sure can face my parents and get along with them. And's kinda nice to know too that his parents let him do what he wants now since he's been responsible. I dunno how much of that I should believe coz he say some things that he forgets in the future. But, I sure really hope he's telling the truth! I really really love him. Anyways, there's only one thing, I kinda lied to him about eating pork. I just thought it's a big deal to him so I guess a little white lie wouldn't hurt. I'll just quit eating those when he finally gets here and even after that. Bt, there's also this one thing about "wasting money for calls". It kinda hurt me to think that he thinks that the reason why he doesn't want to call me is coz he doesn't want to waste his money. I'm so glad he clarified that issue or else....well, you know me I make a big deal out of a small one.  On a different thing, I asked Anna again if she's going anywhere after work coz I wanna go with her to church, but I guess this is not my lucky day again.=( She told me she's going home with her mom. So, there goes. Why don't I learn anything from this?! Next time I won't even invite her...she can invite herself!

      I can't believe this! How did I ever ended up with no one?! I wanted to go to Greenhills to day to check out this new phone with the digital camera OR just go and watch The Ring (Japanese version, the scarier the better) and I can't find a single person to go with me in this wide wide world! What happened??????? Where are my friends when I needed them!   First, I asked my officemate Anna and she told me she can't go with me coz she's seeing her "best bud in the world". If she has a best bud already, then there's no way we can ever be "close bud's" or "always-here-for-you" friend. Second option is my sister. She's prolly near here somewhere. But, when I called home, my mom told me she went to a movie with my other sis at Robinson's Place (which is pratically 1 1/2 hrs from here!). Then third is my so-called friend and classmate. BUT, she told me she's busy coz she had to do something for her dad. Then...no one came next. It's saaaaaaaaaaaaddddd! How come I had only like 3 pathetic choices, all of which are not really my first choice at all. I guess this only means one thing...that I don't have a "buddy" in this cold, miserable city!=((  I guess it was my fault why it had all come to this. I never exerted enough effort to be close to anyone since I've always known that I'll always have two good friends in the person of Tin and Che. But where are they now??? Miles away from me! I'll never be able to share my woes with them and get comfort from them like a true and "present" friend can do. What can I do? I'm just not the friendly type and I never just get close to anybody. The irony of it is that those two "close friends" of mine did a lousy job when I felt so down past few weeks. I can't say the same for Che coz she has always been so sweet to me. But, what really disappointed me was Tin. I was telling her how I think I'll go crazy coz I'm so hurt with what's happening between myself and Jan and all she can tell me was "maybe it's just a phase and u still need to adjust". We've been bfs and gfs for more than a year and we still need to adjust?! There is not great change that happened that we needed to adjust! Then it takes her ages to reply too! Well, so much for best friends. We don't talk that much anymore now...she has her bf now.   What will I do now? I'm thinking of my college friend Mariel. But she's so "unstable" that I don't know how long I have to wait before I can get any reply from her. As for a new friend? I don't know if it would ever be possible. At my age, chances are all those whom I'm supposed to be freinds prolly have their own set of friends and I can't get into those relationships. I'll always be a second fiddle. They'll have time for me when they don't have anywhere else to go with friend #1. It's so sad and depressing. Thank God I still have Fahim. But even so, a friend is different from a bf, esp if that bf of yours is thousand miles away.=(  I guess I have no choice but to just go home, read a book and watch tv with my mom. We're prolly feeling the same thing, with her sis as her only friend. Ok, byeeeeeeee!   P.S. I mailed Jan his pjs, shirt and pillowcase (my gift) this morning. I hope he likes it, no matter how silly it is.

      I first heard   Heaven by DJ Sammy   long long time ago when I was still a kid, but I've only paid attention to the lyrics now. I've seen the video with the lyrics below the screen and I have just now understood what i means. It's so mushy and I love it to pieces! I have to share it with jan coz it reminds me very much of him and our love. For me, being with him is like a little piece of heaven n earth! So, I just had to post this so I'll remember it in the future (although I don't think I'll ever forget a song like this!). These songs are what memories are made of, right?    CHORUS: Baby you're all that I want When you're lyin' here in my arms I'm findin' it hard to believe We're in heaven And love is all that I need And I found it there in your heart It isn't too hard to see We're in heaven     Oh, thinkin' about all our younger years There was only you and me We were young and wild and free Now nothin' can take you away from me We've been down that road before But that's over now You keep me comin' back for more     CHORUS     Oh, once in your life you find someone Who will turn your world around Bring you up when you're feelin' down Yeah, nothin' could change what you mean to me Oh, there's lots that I could say But just hold me now 'Cause our love will light the way     CHORUS     I've been waitin' for so long For somethin' to arrive For love to come along Now our dreams are comin' true Through the good times and the bad Yeah, I'll be standin' there by you     CHORUS    Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! It's so beeeeaauutiful! I love u honeeyyyyy. You're my heaven on earth!

      I guess I was just being paranoid last week...or maybe we're both not in our best moods, but today I think we are indeed in our best moods coz jan was really affectionate and sweet today, well, except for some snotty remarks (which will always be there!).

      My mom's leaving for Cebu today and as usual it drive me crazy. I hate it when someone from my family leaves for someplace coz I always get this uneasy feeling. I guess if you experienced something "traumatic" in your life, maybe ul react the same way coz I've watch E-profiles the other and I saw this actress talk about the same fear. And she got that coz her bestfriend died and they were not able to do that they've planned to do. So, she went into this phase where everytime she gets separated with someone she makes it a point to end it in a nice way or do something nice for fear that that migth be the last time they'll see each other again. Same goes with me, I always do that...all the time! And that's coz of what happened when my grandma died. I was here in college then and she was in the province. Before I left, we got into a fight and I was really short-tempered with her, not knowing that it will be our last moment together. =( I was so devastated and I really felt bad for being so bad with her esp. since she's the closest to me above all people and I grew up with her. So, there goes...  I hope jan can make me feel better about this...coz he always does. He's like my bestfriend now eventhough he's such a brat sometimes. But I know he loves me. He told me he didn't like the graphic on the pillowcase I gave him (I kinda expected that) and that he removed it from the pillowcase. Then I just stopped saying to him anything on the phone and he kept on saying "are u crying? pls jan, hon, pls don't cry...hey, r u crying?" and he went over and over. So, I know that he cares about me coz he got really worried that I was crying, but I was not. Someone just came into the room so I can't talk.   These past couple of days ym seems to get messed up at around the time when we're supposed to chat. At last, today, we were able to talk longer. And it was a nice talk. We talked about how we don't seem to get anything done coz we keep on doing stuff we're not supposed to do and how we might find out too late that we've wasted our time and all. We have the same problems really except that I'm hooked on TV and he on doing nothing and hanging-out with friends. He told me about school too and he told me he'll send me his comp maybe I can help him out. Just like two friends, right? Not to mention, he's planning to hook up his cousin with my best friend. Silly jan, but I love it. I feel so close to him like this.  Anyways, I have to do my report for Saturday first. I hope mom will have a safe trip. May God be with her in her travel. I (we) haven't been so nice to her lately and I know she deserves the best treatment. She's the best mom in the world and we don't even show her how much we appreciate her and everything she does at home! I love you mom! Mwaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. Big kiss for you! :X

      I have so much to tell about the kind of politics we have here in our country - the Philippines. And I thought it's best to express my views in a blog coz where else can I be this open? I mean, when I said there is so much to tell, I really mean LOTS of things to say. It actually started from time immemorial. Thanks to my History class reviewer. It's kind of an eye-openner for me.

      I got this news from an ABS-CBN website. I'l post my comments when I have the time.

 Drilon alarmed over ADB report

Senate President Franklin Drilon Thursday expressed alarm over a report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) declaring that the Philippines has one of the worst investment climates in Asia. 

Drilon also noted that according to the report made by the ADB Economics and Research Department, the Philippines ranked 65 on a list of 66 countries in terms of business costs from corruption. Only Bangladesh, which was ranked 66th, was found worst than the Philippines in this category. 

“I think that our government economists must not hide their heads into the sand like ostriches,” said Drilon. “They should face the facts squarely so that the proper solutions could be formulated to solve our economic problems. Also they should not try to hide the facts from the public and the Congress which could legislate the means to cope with the situation.” 

Dr. Ernesto Pernia, ADB lead economist, said in the report that on a regional scale, the Philippines was considered the worst in terms of tax collection and in terms of judicial performance. The report also described the Philippines as a “soft state,” meaning that it had all the pertinent laws but lacked the political will to fully enforce them. 

Consequently, the Philippines has one of the lowest rates of foreign direct investment (FDI) as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) at 1.7 percent. This is only slightly better than the FDI of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. The Philippines has also one of the lowest productivity rates in the region. 

In this connection, Drilon urged the National Economic and Development Authority to come up with a “comprehensive, truthful and realistic report on the state of the national economy and its prospects for the future, and also make recommendations on possible policy changes and directions in order to correct mistakes and draw up a sound and realistic roadmap to progress for immediate implementation.” 

Drilon added that the executive department and judiciary should also step up its drive against corruption and not to “rely on press releases as evidence of success. Rather, they should come up with solid accomplishments in the war against corruption, like the conviction of public officials and private individuals guilty of corruption.” 

Drilon also asked the executive to press down hard on the public works department to step up the construction and maintenance of infrastructures whose poor condition the ADB blamed for the reluctance of foreign investors to invest in the Philippines.

      GIVE ME A BREAK!

When I heard the news last night, I don't know whether to get angry or to laugh. I mean it's stupid really, only shows how stupid he is himself. Don't mean to insult anybody, just stating a fact. 

If there's one thing I'm praying for right now is for that "actor" not to win. It would really really be embarrassing for us Filipinos if he does win! For goodness sakes! Estrada is one mistake already! We don't need another blunder!!!! The sad part is that this country is prolly like 80% poor and less middle class and even lesser (like 5%?) rich, and it usually turns out that those "poor" are the ones voting for losers like Estrada and FPJ. I don't mean to belittle them coz I understand their predicamenet coz I myself am not rich. The problem is these two "actors" are "ACTORS" so they know how to play with people's emotions and show the people whatever it is they wanted to see. Since most of the populace are poor and felt "inaapi" (like the soaps that are being shown here!), they also act as if they're "inaapi" and poor, thus, the poor people identifies with them. Meaning more votes!

National election was held last Monday and it was as usual not a sight for sore eyes. A lot of people didn't get to vote since they were not on the list (thank goodness if those are FPJ votes!). A day after... a victory rally? It's really funny in an irritating sort of way. I mean they're actually protesting that GMA is leading on the exit polls (i.e. "surveys"). If GMA wins, they would think it was cheating. In other words, GMA shouldn't win "honestly" or "dishonestly" coz either way, for them it would be cheating. What idiots! It's really really irritating!

For now, my only thought is that anyone of the presidential candidates will do but him. Even the thought of it gives me a feeling of embarrassment and desperation. Actually, I voted for GMA. She may have her faults, but she's tough and smart! Not to mention a WOMAN. ;)

        a new beginning  I don't know if this is such a great idea...i mean having a new blog instead of just continuing th old one. But, I want to turn over a new leaf no matter how cliche it may sound. In my other blog, it was almost all about Janu that it should have been aptly titled "My so-called love for **him". It can't be considered as talking about my life, although my life do revolve around him. I've realized though that that is not such a good thing. Coz when your life revolves around someone else, you forget about yourself and thus end up becoming too clingy to that person for fear of losing him. Sometimes, the more you keep that person to urself the more you'll end up losing him. 

Last Monday (3 days ago), we agreed on not chatting everyday anymore. I was thinking of the same thing on my way to work early morning, but he has beaten me to it and said it first. My reaon was a lot different though. It's more like I think I've become so clingy and irritatingly whiny and depressed that I think I should start fixing myself up or else he'll end up falling out of love with me. I know he fell inlove with a totally different person. I don't know when the change happend but I know that I have changed. I used to be the easy-go-lucky playful flirt and "smart" and witty too, but now...all I am is an insecure girl who's afraid of losing him. So, I thought that distancing myself from him a little will let me be myself again and start having friends again and not have a life centered around him.

His reason was a lot different though. He told me he's tired of chatting and that it's not about me. The hell it is. If you get tired of chatting with someone, that means you're just not having fun talking with that person anymore. But, I guess he just doesn't want to hurt me that's why he said that. But, I know that I've become so boring he can't stand chatting with me anymore. I don't know what to think about it but I'm doing all I can to to refrain from whining to him everytime I have a bad day or get depressed. I almost asked him to come online last night, but I stopped myself from doing that...I want to be challenging again and not be such a "too available" girlfriend. Anyways, it's either ESP or what, but he ended up telling me that he'll come online today. Isn't that great?!

Well, my point of doing all this is to make him miss me.  I just don't think he misses me coz he used to rush home to chat with me, but now it's more like an unpleasant task to him. I don't like that and I don't want him to grow tired of me at all. I don't really know what's gonna happen but I'm focusing all my energy now at trying to find a way to get out of this country. I really need to see him although I don't tell him that anymore. I've ignored my pride too long and now it's time to put it back where it belonged. My friend once told me that it's all about "pasiklaban" if you want him to be "hopelessly devoted to you".

That's only one thing though, another thing is losing weigh and trying to get back to my old physical shape. I'm just so out of shape now and guys wants their girl to be pretty and inshape. It's really hard to lose weight though...sooooooo hard. But I hope I'll lose all these extra pounds soon and get all pretty so I can send him my new "pretty" pic. That would give him some "second thoughts" if he's gonna dump me or not, right?

OK, I guess I've to run. I don't think I did what I was supposed to do. Have you noticed? This blog is still all about him. Gosh! I hope I'll do better next blog...although he'll always be a part of my day somehow...with or without chatting with him. That's how much I love him. To pieces!!!

        do we still have a relationship?  What makes a relationship in the first place? Two people mutually inlove and communication (?). When two people are inlove, wouldn't they exert effort to let that love grow or do everything in their power to work things out? This is esp impt in a long-distance relationship where the odds are againts it. I mean it's hard enough to let a "close" relationship survive, much more a long-distanced one. I don't think I can take any more of this! I can pretend to Jan that I'm fine with all these and that this is not a big deal, but I can't pretend anymore. I need to have a long talk with him! 

I guess this "new me" thing is just a front to my inner misgivings and just to make me feel better. But, truth is I'm really hurting inside. I would like to think that I'm fine and I'm strong, that I can take anything now. I don't know what to do. I used to be able to speak to him about anything on my mind but now...it's a lot harder to do that. One is coz he just doesn't have the time to talk with me and the other is that he always takes it the wrong way. It's hard for him to understand that I don't wanna break up with him. I just want to fix our problem. I don't know if he's just pretending that there is no problem (maybe he doesn't love me that much to bother him!) or it's just his way of keeping me away and not talk. Lately, he really gets easily irritated with me and I haven't felt any of his "love" for me.

Yesterday, I didn't get any sms from him the whole day...only at night when I was about to sleep. He said sorry for not being able to sms me coz he was not feeling well. I was really pissed off and hurt so I opted not to reply instead. It's better to just keep my mouth shut than complain. I replied just this morning, else he might think that I don't care that he's sick. I don't know why doesn't he just tell me that he doesn't love me anymore instead of letting me hang like this. It reeeeeeaaaaaaaaallly hurts like hell I wanted to burst into tears right here!!

I'll try to talk to him tonight (or 2am) after I prepare my report. I need to get to the bottom of this before I grow crazy. I don't wanna find out though that he doesn't love me anymore. But, what can I do? Its better than not knowing at all. Who was I kidding? What do you expect from an online relationship??? Esp with a "young" guy??? Dear God, please let him be nice to me and understand that this is not gonna help our relationship. I just hope I can get home without crying myself to tears. I shouldn't have taken this seriously in the first place!!! Now, I don't know if it was all worth the pain. I used to say it was all worth it...=(

        new or old me?  I really dont know what I'm after. Is it to bring back the old "cheerful, funny, witty" me or to come up with a totally new me?? I don't know really but I just wanna be the same person I was before I turned into what I am now - a clingy, depressed and humorless person...and maybe a little intellectually stupid too!

Anyways, I think this weekend was a nice start for me coz I didn't stay up all night to wait on Janu to calle me up or else I would have been pissed off coz he called me at 6:30 AM. He told me he's only saying good morning to me and hung up. Well, I guess he was just kidding when he told me that he when he said 30mins, it meant 5mins each day! So, I told him in a laughing manner that he's such a liar. I don't wanna get all serious about it and start to nag coz I'm planning to be like before right? It turned out though that he's just kidding and so we had our 30mins moment. I'm glad that I've kinda regained my sense of humor coz we kidded a lot although there are moments of "serious matter" like that ex-gf thing which I didn't dwell on. I'm supposed to be confident right?

Then in the PM, it turned out that two of my profs are not around so I only have one class. One have informed us since last week but the other one was kinda "late" informing us like she always do. So, I just waited for Maribel to get my book and got the hell out of that place and found myself with my friend at the mall watching Daredevil with Ben Affleck. He's such a cute guy but he doesn't have that much appeal to me now that he's engaged to J. Lo. Actually, the one which had an impact on me was Jennifer Garner...but I'm not a lesbian mind you. I just thought she's sooo sexy and it's so cool that she's so fit she can make all those fighting moves (doesn't matter if she has a double) and I tot I wanna have a body like that!!! A little bit of muscle is sexy which I didn't think so before. I guess I should start canvassing about tae bo or karate or whatever in fitness centers so I could start now. Hmmm....that can be part of my new ME plan!

I've mentioned to you about being with a friend and that's Quens. She's my high school friend who just came back from K.S.A. and since her "other" friend got home too, she's not my fave person in the world to be with. AT first, we hang-out and share secrets adn laugh and laugh and had fun but there's something inside me which yells that she's using me and only finds time to be with me when she needs something! It hurts but...I have noticed that in her. First time we met, she asked me to type her resume which is quite long. Then she kept on sending me sms and is quite sweet in her msgs. Then we met again...so she got her resume from me. Then she forgot about me when her friend arrived from K.S.A. She even forgot that she's supposed to stay for a nigth at my home and even turned me down when I asked  her if we can go out. That really hurt me that someone could use me like that. So, I kept ignoring her sms. Then she came back and asked me if we can go out last Sunday and since I never bury that much hard feelings against her since it is just few offense I agreed. But we moved it to Sat as you can see. Then it happened again...!@#$% She asked me if we can go to a net cafe coz she haave to copy her resume to another diskette so I agreed since I tot that was all. I was wrong though! When we were there she got out this kinda long written resume and asked me a "huge favor if I can type it"! I was really pissed off but I didn't show it. I was really hurt that someone would only like to be with me so she can use me and let me type for her. I'm not her secretary for God's sake!!! But, it's not really about that...I made a replay of images on my mind and jumped to the conclusion that the reason why she was so willing to see me even it wasn't that convenient for her and at just short notice was not because she miss me?:(( It's because SHE NEEDS SOMETHING FROM ME!!! Then the next day, there was no sms again. I was not surprised...not at all!

Sunday was quite a nice day for me...quite fruitful except for the part when I was baking brownies and place salt into my batter instead of sugar! Yes, you read it right. I placed 1/2 cup of iodized salt on my brownies and tried to fix it by putting like 1/2 kilo of sugar in it. But, it didn't get fixed. Glazed fruits and choco frosting after...it still taste like....agh eww...I wanna puke right now just thinking about it. It smells good but...you have an idea how it taste. Taste like sea water! Poor sisters..they were smelling it and was really looking forward to it! hehe!!! I'm thinking of making another one next weekend and will make it better this time. I can't afford to have a failure like that on my cap!!! It just isn't like me to fail...in cooking that is.=)

       widening distance I had a "heart to heart" talk with Jan last week, Thursday and I tot everything will be running smoothly from there. I was supposed to break up with him that time, that is, depending on his reaction. If he doesn't agree with me then it's the end. But since he doesn't want to break up with me and he said does love me, he's just having a hard time right now then I changed my mind (we always give the ones we love millions of chances, right? It can be frustrating sometimes.).

A week after and still there's no change. He has continuously put me down and I he doesn't even make me feel the warmth of his love. I mean, sms is all the communication we've got now and yet he can't do that. So, it's just like I'm not having a relationship with anyone at all. I don't know what's his idea of a relationship...does he think of it like that of just having a friendship? It's different coz here commitment is needed. I can't send him email too coz I don't know if he reads it or not. If he does, then I don't think he replies. 

Yesterday, I haven't heard from him the whole day and I have a feeling it's gonna be the same today. He didn't say good morning and goodnight to me during the day so I opted not to do the same to him either. I have to make him feel that I'm not fine with it and I'm a little angry and hurt. I mean there's 24 hours to a day and sending an sms only takes like 5 mins if you're slow. In his case, it's much faster than that. I believe that if you really love someone, no matter how very busy you are you'll always try to find time for that person. I'm not asking for so much, am I? I feel like crying but I don't wanna cry for him anymore. I'm sooooo disappointed in him. I don't know what's wrong. He tells me that there's nothing wrong, but I don't think so.

I'm not planning to be the first one to break the sms silence this time. I have done that lots of times in the past and this time it's his fault so I'm not giving in. If he truly loves me he'll keep in touch. If he does, I'm not really sure if I wanted to reply. I just feel it's so useless coz he'll still keep on doing it. I'm even thinking what if he'll never make the first move? What if we'll just go on ignoring each other and end up just disappearing from each other's life? I hope that won't happen. If he truly loves me....I just hope he'll realize that it's his fault and I'm not going to please him this time. If it doesn't turn out the way I wanted it to be, then I guess I just have to accept reality. I can't force anyone to love me, nor do I want to waste my time with someone who doesn't return the love that I'm giving him. It's not like I wanted my love to be repaid or something, but think about it, can anyone go on loving someone if he doesn't get any love in return? Love should be replenished and nourished or else it will go dry and die.

Please Jan, I hope your hearing my tots. I really love you and I don't wanna lose you, but there are things in life that I have no control over - your feelings. This time it's up to you.=(

       heartbreaker or heartbroken I just took this test and tot I wanted to post it. For whatever reason, I don't know...maybe to remind me not to keep on doing things the way I did. Isn't this what journaling is all about? 

  Are You a Heartbreaker?  by Andrea Kerr from eHarlequin.com
 Do you leave a trail of broken hearts in your wake? Or is it your heart that aches? 
When it comes to the game of love, how do you play? Do you always strive to be victorious, emerging with nary a bruise after ruthlessly stealing the heart of your opponent? Or have you loved and lost in every match? 

Here's the result folks! 

 Heartbroken (24 – 30 points) 
 Get yourself to a cardiac surgeon quick, because your heart is in serious need of repair! 
 Sure, other people can be cruel and thoughtless, but you've let yourself be used and abused when it comes to love. It's time you got over the childhood chum that stole your first boyfriend. Think of being dumped by that loser who stole your money and your heart as a learning experience. Letting go of past wrongs and, yes, even forgiving those responsible, will go a long way toward improving your outlook on life. 
 You can't control every situation, but you can control how you react to things. As long as you believe you are worthy of true love and friendship, no one will be able to convince you otherwise. 

I'm so pathetic! =( waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah =((

       Finally... I had the chance to update my blog and POOF! it got erased. It's more like I clicked on the wrong button and closed the window without saving it first! Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....There goes..and I've been typing for 20-30 mins already! I hate it when these things happen, but I wonder how come it keeps on happening even after I told myself I'll be more careful next time.

As I was saying in my blog that had just evaporated (sob...sob...)...er..I can't remember...whaaaaa... Lemme see...hmmm...I can remember my second para though.  I was saying how much of a procrastinator I am so much so that my life is so messed up right now (that's the way I see it), although I can't exactly put a finger on what is so messed up about it. All I know is that this is not the way I wanted my life to be in terms of career and everything. So, I just felt like I'm so messed up coz I don't know where to start to change my fate. *sigh* Back to procrastinating, I'm planning to take the Licensure Examination for Teaching (LET) this August and yet...I still haven't applied for the said exam. And worst, I don't even have my grades yet!  Actually, I haven't applied yet although I tred to apply yesterday for my transcript. The school asked me to sign my clearance first blah blah blah and when I got to the registrar they told me my grades has not been submitted to them yet. Bull****! The deadline for the application for the LET will be in May 31, 2003 and it seems like it's still far away, but somebody told me that they sometimes close the application earlier, even in April! Heaven forbid or else I'll be very lost...lost...lost...

Another sign that I'm a procrastinator is that I'm planning to take the LET for Social Studies, which is not my major since I'm an Economics major! So, how am I going to pass that?? By reading or "browsing" social studies topics or books like political science, Asian history, Philippine History, etc. Time is running and yet I haven't even started reading some of those books! I started reading a few pages of PolSci but I got sleepy after a few pages...zzzzzzz...It's pretty interesting except that I was in a public place during that time and I only started reading coz I got so bored waiting.  Gosh! I wonder when I'm finally going to get the momentum to study. I'm the kind of person who relies on "momentum". hehe! Okey, I guess that's one way of just trying to delay doing the task that should be done. I have to get my act together or else I'll be stuck being someone else's slave! Whaaaaaaaa......

I still have so much to say and I hope I'll still have more time in my hands to write it all down. My boss went somewhere so I'm free...bwahahaha...=). Anyways, I've been quite irritable these past few days and you know what that means...lots of fight with Janu.=)  I'm still trying to decide whether he's the cause of my irritation or he's just the victim.  All I know is that he just have this talent of knowing how to sting a person. He told me once he likes this Simon guy in "American Idol", well I'm not surprised. If you knew my Janu, you would think they're twins. We were fighting about his not having time for me and all and he said "ya, I don't have time for u. so what. are we married? i knew them (friends and family) before I was born. i knew them before I met u..blah blah..and it really stung. I kept thinking about it and sometimes burst into tears on my way home. What a scathing remark! Then I had a talk with him again about why he doesn't call me blah blah. I guess I'm also getting into his nerves coz of my nagging..hehe...which is I think only fair. He told me I put too much pressure on him. I asked him if he wants to work things out or just break up. He said I don't know.  That's what he always say. The other day I told him that maybe Im just not the right girl for him coz I'll always be like this (meaning a nag..hehe) and he said I'm the right one coz I have everything.  So, how come he doesn't keep his act together. OK, maybe I don't understand him at all. Anyways, I guess he doesn't want to break up. Whatever. It's so hard to tell with guys. They make me go crazy.*sigh*

My other best friend, Che, left for Ireland last Sunday and I so so so envy her. I got kinda depressed couple of days after that coz I just felt like how come everything good is happening to everybody while I'm stuck here in wherever I am. Is it just a matter of not counting my blessing? I don't know. All I know is that I wanna go somewhere and not be stuck here forever and I don't see that happening soon! =(( My friend, Mel, and I used to have this plan to go and travel somewhere but we're not in good terms anymore now. We had a fight (actually, a series of fights coz we're always fighting!) and we've never spoken again for several weeks now. I don't care coz I just hate being lied to and she does that all the time, even after giving her 100x chances! So, there goes...I just hope it will not let me be disappointed with humanity.

One more thing, something really made me happy coz someone has put a tag on my shout box. I didn't know someone actually "glance" (coz I don't know if Kib actually read it.lol) at my blog coz it's really boring. I'm only interested in it coz it's my way of knowing my mistakes and promises to myself. It does help to have a documentary of what you've done in your life so far.;) Thanks for the compliment too.:D

  What Men Love about Love: 6 Things That Might Surprise You    Although most won't admit it, men love to be in love. In fact, many men need to be in a relationship more than women do. This is because a good relationship is settling for a man, a place where he can share feelings that he might not be able to talk about with anyone else. In our society, women are permitted to have close, bonded relationships with their girlfriends. They talk to each other openly, and turn to one another for support easily, but men don't. Believe it or not, for many guys their love relationship is the one place where they can allow themselves to be truly intimate. 

As a therapist in New York City, I've counseled many men in relationships who agree. And after interviewing men to write my first two books Why Men Leave and What He Can't Tell You ... and Needs to Say five reasons emerged that explain what they really like about relationships. Check them out here. You might be surprised by what these guys say! 

  Feeling free enough to really be himself   
"When I'm in a relationship, I'm a different man than when I'm not," Bob said "When I'm out there running around with the guys, I feel part of a pack, on the hunt. Sure, it can be fun for a while. But, believe me, every one of the guys in the group is hoping to meet someone each night. And I don't just mean someone for sex. I mean someone for everything, the 'real thing.'"

When asked what "the real thing" meant to him -- and his friends -- Bob grinned. "It means someone who will take you for what you are. Who likes you that way. Who isn't going to start finding fault, but instead, start finding all the things about you that are terrific." 

When a guy is in a relationship where he is allowed to be himself, he feels more confident. He feels loveable and worthy. Just by being there, the woman he is dating or married to reminds him that she chose him out of all the others. This kind of feeling is hard to get in any other way. It helps all aspects of his life. 

  Being inspired to be a better man   
Andy said he loves the challenge of relationships. He knows he has to work at it in order to make a love affair last. "Relationships make me keep myself up, work out, look good, stay sharp, keep my eye on the competition. After all, I don't want her running off with some other guy. When things work out, I feel like a winner. I feel proud showing her off to my family and friends too. It's like I'm saying, look what I have. Look who I am." 

For many guys like Andy, relationships are a big ego boost. They keep them on the sharp edge of life, and force them to be the best they can. In As Good As It Gets, Jack Nicholson's character says to Helen Hunt's, "You make me want to be a better man," and it is indeed a compliment. 

  Simply having a partner who understands him  
For Tim, it's slightly different. Tim loves the rush of looking forward to spending a romantic weekend with the woman of his dreams. "When I'm in a relationship," Tim said, "the woman becomes the woman of my dreams. She's beautiful. She's fabulous. I think about her all week long and can't wait for us to be together on the weekend, (or sometimes week nights). It makes the whole day exciting. When things get boring or rough, I think of her and feel great. 

"It's something to look forward to. It reminds me that there's a prize for me at the end of the road." 

For a guy like Tim, being in a relationship fills his life with fun and joy. Seeing his girlfriend's smile or hearing her voice becomes the reward for all of his hard work. His relationship reminds him that there's more to life than the rough times, and he can enjoy himself every day. 

  Having the chance to make your day   
Edgar said that what he loves about being in a relationship is knowing that he can make someone else happy. Knowing that he's capable of doing this makes him feel good inside. 

"It's the best feeling in the world," he said, "to see my girlfriend's face light up when I walk in the door. If I know she needs me and that I can make her happy, take some of her problems away, I feel terrific, like it's all worthwhile." 

This is a particularly interesting comment, because when I interviewed men for Why Men Leave, the number one reason they said they left relationships was because they felt they could not satisfy their partner or meet her needs. Not being able to make someone happy made them feel inadequate. Men need to feel as though they're doing a good job. And they need to hear the acknowledgement of that from the woman they're with. When a man feels like he can please his girlfriend or wife, it makes him feel wonderful about himself. 

  Enjoying the sexy returns   
Lanny had something else to say. "I'll be really frank about it," he said. "I love the sex. I need it. It's important to me. When I have good sex in my relationship, I feel happy all week long. When I don't, it makes me edgy. I love to know that a woman thinks I'm sexy." 

Of course both partners are nourished by a relationship that includes good sex. And sex can mean different things to people in relationships. But for many men, it simply helps them feel loved, approved, admired and acknowledged. It becomes like food that's impossible to live without. 

  Sharing his life with someone   
What Mark loves about being in a relationship is having someone to come home to. "This may sound strange," Mark said, "but for me, it's great knowing that at the end of the day there's someone there, waiting for me. Whether that's because we're living together, or knowing that she's someone who I can call, it's comforting. That we check in with each other, go over the day, laugh at jokes and work things out. I need to have someone who cares about how things are going for me. This makes a huge difference in how I do at work." 

Many men are bolstered in their work and supported in their everyday lives by simply having a partner who cares what happens to them. Someone who is there for them, to help them solve problems, big or small. This kind of care provides balance and stability. But even more importantly, it reminds men in relationships that they are not alone in a competitive workplace where it sometimes seems as though people only care about themselves. 

Loving couples know that a relationship is a great gift for both partners. The men who don't seem to be able to commit because they run from one relationship to another, or avoid them altogether, might simply not be able to find the right person. A man truly needs to find someone who makes him feel safe and cared for, a woman who sees the best in him and lets him know it. When se shows that she is happy with him, he will appreciate the relationship more. After all, if she loves being in love with him, what could be more rewarding?

       How do I put a pic or link in this blog!*?#$*& I' ve been trying to do that for hours and no success! I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I think I'm gonna cry from frustration. Whaaaaaaaaa! I've been using html tags and I guess I'm doing it wrong. Anyways, I haven't blogged for quite awhile and that's coz I was busy doing my homepage (as if! hehe) not to mention work and study at the same time. My page though is not even close to getting finished. I'm still trying to grasp this html thing and have to look for some web developing software. I just hope I'm not doing things wrong esp. with copyrights and all (although I'm not copying anything, I'm very careful!). I think I have to plan what my site's gonna be about but I pretty much have an idea already what to put in there. I'm very excited about it now. But I think, if I want it to look very "professional" I have to get some course about webpage designing or prolly read some books and not just rely on freebies (although freebies are veeeeeeeeery helpful, sometimes even more than those expensive instructional achuchu).  Have to go now coz I don't wanna get stuck in traffic or the rush hour...coz of this SARS thing!

       swindler? I'm so bothered about not hearing from Doods for days now. Very very bothered! Not knowing is worst than knowing something bad has happened coz it makes me crazy jsut thinking about all those things that could have made him not call me up to this time. I don't want to think that he's actually a crook and he has swindeled me my Php 23,000 ($460!). Our agreement was he'll go to Subic last Thursday and he'll give me my cellphone on Sunday or Monday. But, it's Tuesday and still I haven't heard from him! I keep calling his house like thousand times and his "maid" answered me only 3x. I don't wanna be paranoid or something but I think she answered my call when I was using another phone number (they have a caller ID). Is Doods hiding from me??? I hope not. I just hope he'll get intouch with me soon coz my friend, who's gonna buy the other phone, would soon start asking questions. It would be very embarassing to tell him that I don't know where Doods is. It's very un-businesslike. Oh God, please don't let this happen to me! I'm so cash-strapped right now and my parents are gonna kill me if they found out! I'm such a lousy judge of character but I hope, really really, that I'm WRONG!

      I don't know what Mel want from me but she kept on sending me sms that she wanted to talk to me, not to ask another chance but to explain her side. The hell with her. I don't need no explanation. Her stupid boyfriend was rude to me on the phone and she took his side. She prolly tot I was making it up when I told her about it. That's all, no explanations needed! 

Janu didn't send me any sms this whole day. I found out he was online an hour after when I tried to log back in. I was not receiving his msg! When I smsed him, he didnt reply. It's either he was already sleeping or too lazy to reply. I guess he was not motivated enough to sms me or email me or whatever. It's a bad thing I know, but I love him and I'm being stupid. I'm really not in the mood to argue about serious stuff coz I'm feeling so bloody sick with my monthly cramps and my boss is making everything worst by giving me these bloody dictations!

      I was reading all these blogs and sites about getting an MBA or into grad school in the USA and I got depressed. There was this particularly one cool site from WHarton where you can asked students from that school tons of questions thru posts. I just kept on reading and reading trying to get ideas and I got tons of ideas all right. I realized that I'll never get a chance at an "American education" standing from where I am now. It's too depressing!=(( It's also kinda unfair that I leave in this country where opportunities are very slim, unlike in other countries, much to the advantage of those in richer nations. I mean, here, the keyword is "settle".  Better settle on a certain job, which you don't like or are overqualified for (!!!), that have no job at all. Maybe it happens in other third world countries too, but the last time I read Philippines is second to Bangladesh in terms of being a poor country. That means we're second to the last.  Now, Vietnam is even better off than us. Thanks to all our corrupt officials!

So, I kept on pondering as to what do I have to show for when I apply in those schools. I was an "average" when I was in college and my job sucks.  I was thinking that maybe if I do well in the Licensure for Teachers, it would be like my passport (or one of my passports).  But the problem is, does life begin at 26??? I can just feel that time is running out. huhuhu...Oh why oh why...there are lots of things that I would have done differently if I only knew I'll end up in this hellhole.=( The only thing that doesn't make me regret where I am now is Jan. If I haven't worked here, not in a million years would I even have met him! I just hope that it's worth it and it's gonna work so I would keep on looking at this part of my life as not a waste of time.

I'll be going in a little while to workout. I hope exercise would help clear up my mind a little and give me more energy coz I've become so sluggish. I get tired at the slightest movement, well, not really at the "slightest" but when I get home I just feel so tired like i run out of energy.  But, exercise kinda makes you feel like you're "healthy" and when I exercise at home, it helps me keep on going and going. I hope my theory is correct coz I need added energy so I can study later in the evening. I don't just wanna pass the LET, I wanna be one of the topnotchers. God willing! I hope I'll have the same motivation I had when I took the LSAT(Law School Aptitude Test) in WMSU.  It was my happiest moment (well, one of the...) when I found out that I top the exam (maybe in my batch) but it sure is very inspiring and ego boosting esp during that time when I can't even find a job and feeling rather worthless!

I guess I better pack up now. Gotta run! I'm glad that I had time to blog today! I better learn how to apply time management! It would really help me a lot!

      I dunno why I keep trying hard to put a title on each of my blogs.  Now I think it's silly, esp at times when my day was too boring or there's just no right word to describe my day. 

I got an sms from that guy I'm cazry about last night. Kind of a sweet surprise coz I was not expecting it. He does that sometimes or it just happens. Wehn I don't expect anything he calls me up or sends me sms, but when I'm expecting it never happens which just blows me off.  

Mharj and I are going to the gym for an aerobics trial. I'm really not looking forward to it coz I don't have a shoes. I'm kinda thinking of using my boss' shoes instead.  He he! He has not worn it but once and he keeps it in the office. The more I think about it, the more I get convinced to wear it. Just don't tell him. Shhhh!=)

I had lunch with Anna yesterday, of course with Mharj and I went with her to her office to submit my resume. I don't know if I'm being selfish or not by submitting my resume instead of my sister's. I just tot that they might give me a very good position that has lots of potentials in it. I need to do somethign worthwhile and challenging or else I'll die a loser. BUT, at my sis expense? Maybe I should talk to my sis coz I really feel bad about it. The only consolation is that I don't think

       Just trying to keep my post updated but I guess I can't do it everyday.  Now, I have so much to talk to about.

Last Monday, my old high school buddies and I met at Glorietta to have a chat and don't know what else, maybe to try to measure up each other and try to compare. We really are a bunch of hypocrites coz in the first place I don't like Mil and I know Quens doesn't like her too and both Quens and I knows that the feeling is mutual. I guess she just wanted to see how we're doing and if we've become prettier than her. hehe.  It's just bad to think about someone in that way but that's just the way she is.  So, all we did was talk about our poor other classmates who did this and that and passed judgement. I don't like doing it so I just made up some jokes about those past classmates in a way that I don't have to make comments about their fate, miserable or not.

Mil and used to be the best of friends. We're inseparable in such a way that when one is around, the other one would be there too.  Once, we had the same hairstyle and people tot we're twins. But, we had a fight in high school and it lasted very long. It's like I dislike what she does sometimes except that I never judged her and stayed at her side as long as she doesn't bullshit me. But, it happened once and that was the last.

       Changes... I just changed my blogs' template coz my old one looks like a 6-years-old's blog. Pink everywhere. I doesn't look like an intellectual blog (which I would like to project I am obviously to no avail if I keep on talking about my lovelife!).  I picked orange coz I heard from one of the psychologist here that orange is a "power color".  I'd like to think that I'm a powerful person, not in a superhuman kind of way but in a strong personality sense. I once took a personality test which a friend of mine gave me and she told me that I have a strong personality (which I hope is in all aspect of my life) which is why my relationships don't last. sob..sob.. To augment this, they said, I should look for someone with a very strong personality that he "make me" do things  sometimes and not the other way around.  My past loves have always been underdogs in ways you can't imagine. hehe.  Does this mean Janu has a strong personality? Is that the kind of personality that those people are telling me about? Is he the guy for me? Sometimes he bosses me around but on most occasions when I'm really pissed off and try to use my head I get to boss him around. It even surprises me that, when I don't expect it most, he lets me boss him around. But those are just rare occasions. 
Anyways, that's all I can say about this template...hehe...from template to Janu. I guess I always go back to talking about him no matter what the subject is. There's just no escape!

      I'm so relieved I finally got my transcript! But only one copy coz they told me they'll give me one copy first for the LET and give the other one later.

Anyways, I had lunch with Anna and Mharj and we're all like dieting although both of them are fatter than me.  The problem is, I don't know why everytime I look at them I have this insecurity feeling inside of me.  They're both made up coz they use make-up and their dressed up in a very ladylike manner while I'm only dressed in my Friday getup - jeans and shirt!  I don't know why I react this way.  Maybe because they're both prettier than me?? Or maybe because they're already pretty even when they're fat, so what more when they get thin.  I know I shouldn't feel this way.  Is my self-esteem lower than I had imagined? What's wrong with me?!

       what a day! This day is turning out to be like one of those days where when it starts bad, the whole day would be consistently bad too.  I went to school to get my transcript thinking that by this time (one month after!) I would get my transcript since I've given them to much allowance. Unfortunately, it was not ready or whatever it is they call it.  The person at the window is unsure of what's the status, at last, that's how I see it.  I tot she has my transcript already coz I saw her picking up some sort of yellow form, hich she later returned to its place.  It was hot and I'm tired coz I was carrying my gym stuff with me and I had to go through lots of transpo and all I got was "follow-up mo na lang".  I lost my temper when I heard that and blurted out that I've been following-it up for a month now (which is an exaggeration coz I've only been following it up for 1-2 weeks, which is already long enough)!  Then I told her that they're keeping their students from progressing coz of the fact that they can't give out transcripts to their students esp. in times of needs. I just couldn't stop...so I went on and on. I told her the deadline for the registration for LET is 31 May which is a Sat. so it would end in Friday (30 May).  If they delay my transcript longer then I wouldn't be able to take the LET and will have to wait for another year to do that! To tell you frankly though, I'm really not ready to take the LET this August coz I'm not doing any studying at all.  Maybe because I still have not registered so I don't feel the urge to study.  I just can't wait for another year coz that would be wasting another year and I can't apply for a teaching post unless I have a LET, unless I teach in college.  Couple of years ago I applied in East-Asia College and I think they considered me coz they gave me an exam and called me couple of times, I was just not interested anymore coz I can't just leave my present job.  Later I learned that it's the Business School of FEU, one of the top ten universities in the country.  I don't know how I can let that kind of opportunity pass.

Anyways, I feel kinda dizzy and I feel like I wanna puke or something. It's the same feeling I have when I'm anemic and I also have this stomach prob. It's as if I'm having diarrhea.  I don't know if my working out is doing all these.  Is it taking a toll on my health.  I'm not really dieting at all.  I still eat full meals except at night, but I still eat when I'm hungry.  This afternoon I had some banana fritters for my snack coz I'm not feeling well and I'm hungry, which is not supposed to be since I had rice and vege for lunch. I don't know what's causing this but I feel nauseated.

I think I better call up Mearsk Sealand (MS) and find out if I passed the exam.  Interested or not, I still wanna know my score so that I'll know where I stand in terms of intelligence.  That way I would know how much improvement I need esp. since I'm planning to take the GRE, which is far from that IQ test at MS.  But still, it is one way of gauging your capability.

Be right back!

       this is life I took an exam at 10 AM this morning and I was expecting that it was for a higher (higher than Anna's actually) post but I was disappointed. It was actually for the same position - documentation assistant.  Just by the name of it it already sounds boring to me.  I don't think I'm gonna take it, UNLESS there'll be an assurance that I'll get promoted from that position FAST. I mean it's ok if I start in that post as long as I'll not die in that post and it has to be fast coz I'm not getting any younger.  I have to BE SOMEONE soon or before I turn 28 years old!

Anyways, the place was good, just as better as my present workplace - American style workstation.  Office is very cold too, which is what I wanted coz some airconditioned offices are not that cold. I guess I will just have to do the questioning when they give me the job.  I could always turn down the offer right? They would understand that I'm after greener pastures now and not just to settle in just any job.  I'm thinking of the long-run now and not just a temporary thing.  At my age, I should be thinking about my future.  I'm not actually after the TITLE or the position, I'm actually after the PAY! It doesn't matter if I ended up somebody's assistant but if the pay is right, I'll probably take it. So, it's either the pay or the position, whichever comes first.

During in between exams I got an sms from Jan.  A pleasant surprise. He told me to have fun at work and said goodluck to me. He was also really nice last night, except that he's a little busy.  I told him I'm having a hard time accepting what he has told me and he replied that I should take it easy and that he "still loves me kiddo".  Very sweet indeed.  That's why I'm so crazy about him! He's so unpredictable and exciting!

By the way, just to let you know, I lied to my boss about where I went this morning.  I told him I went to school to get my transcript.  I would have like him to know where I went but I don't have a choise.  He's gonna bug me about it and he might not even let me take a leave. He gave me a call this morning but I didn't answer. I wonder what excuse will I give him this time.  No matter what my excuse is, he knows the truth so it doesn't really matter what I tell him.

       love hurts....again I just had a talk with Jan, over the phone. Actually, I called him up last night right after I sent him an sms and told him that I'm not sure whether to send an sms or not coz I'm scared of not getting any reply. But, he did replied.  I was really praying for it. So, I called him up and he's at work kinda busy but we still get to talk for a few minutes. I told him him to just come online so we can chat and he said "he'll see".  But I'm not taking any "we'll see" or "I'll try" from now on so I said he should come online. He did. But the problem is my messenger is messing up. I don't know why these things happen at the wrong moment! Sometimes it makes me think that it's a sign from God or something.  I hope I'm wrong though.

Back to what I was saying, I had a talk with him coz he smsed me if I'm online and that means I'm not getting any msgs. I told him to wait till I restart my pc and log back in. He did. Anyways, it didn't work and we're having those word war again and can't stand ending that way.  So, I called him up and we had a talk.  Here goes...

It was a pretty much good conversation although it's quite heartbreaking too. He told me he's not very serious with me and asked me why I have to take everything so seriously. SERIOUS is the word I guess. I shouldn't take it too seriously, lest I'll hurt myself more. I told him how come he didn't tell me he feels this way. He should have told me about it before so I could have prevented myself from getting too attached. He said he fell inlove with me too. Whatever! I don't know how this could have happened. I feel like crying...I actually am but I'm keeping it from falling or else I won't be able to stop.

       love hurts I don't know how I'm gonna put it down, all I know is when I'll start talking about it I'll start crying too. I don't know what's wrong with the picture? Am I the one at fault or is my bf not giving me the attention that I deserve? Is the "sex and the city" bug getting into me? Maybe watching too much of that show is making me crazy. It makes me depress and think makes me ponder more about my relationships, past and present, more than necessary (or normal). Carrie Bradshaw is one hell of a lucky girl. Where does one find a guy like Adan? Sweet, understanding, thoughtful, sexy, goodlooking...ohhh...and so willing to settle down! Do someone like him even exist???

Once, while I was watching one of the reruns, I almost burst into tears in front of the tv, right in front of my sisters! I was thinking like "how come nobody loves me that way?". Why is it that I'm always the one who has to give too much love? What is it that I do wrong that the tables usually get turned in the middle of the relationship? I guess the problem is I get too clingy or too pushy? Is the fear of losing someone ruining all my chances at having a long and lasting relationship? Maybe. Uhhh! Why does love have to be so complicated?!

Anyways, I cried myself to sleep last night. Janu really hurt me. I have this feeling that he doesn't love me anymore or he loves me less or maybe not as much as I wanted him to be, but he denies it. He tells me that I just don't trust him or I have a different kind of love. He said his love is true that he doesn't need to be "intouch" all the time. Whilst on my part, I always need to be intouch in order to feel it. I guess that's what killls the relationship, asking for reassurance all the time. Maybe I'm just plain insecure!

No matter what the problem is with me, he has some faults too. He never pays me enough attention and that's lethal in a long-distance relationships. Sometimes he just intentionally ignore my sms. I can't believe he does that. I mean how can you do something like that to the person you love?? Not to mention he ignores my calls to? I've never intentionally ignored his calls! Maybe he has become too self-assured, which is an exact opposite of myself. Guys tend to become that way when he thinks that the girl loves him too much that he can get-away with anything. I better follow Anna's advise to let my pride rule sometimes...err..or maybe most of the times. "Pasiklaban" was the exact word that she used.

Last night I've said some things that I thought will scare him into replying. Sometimes when I get really pissed off, I just say anything without  thinking straight. I told him that "I'd rather that he breaks up with me and break my heart onse than have fights with him and break my heart over and over".  When he didn't reply, I got kinda scared coz he might just do that. Pathetic huh?! I'm gonna lose in this game of love if I'll keep on doing that. Tossing and turning and a couple of tears after, I told him I can't sleep like this. That's when he replied and said goodnight and love u.  I don't know what's wrong with me, but I just never get contented coz I asked for hugs and kisses. I guess I was asking for too much right after a fight, it's just not the right time.  So, as expected (although I was hoping he'll do one of those unexpected things), he didn't reply and that hurt me more. That's why I ended up crying myself to sleep.  And what's more, I just get myself lower and lower by smsing him this morning and apologizing for being stupid. Stupid! Stupid me! How did I ever come to being like this? Love always do these things to me!

I better get my act together before Janu realizes that I'm such a miserable freak and too clingy for his taste. I don't think guys like that. The damsel in distress might get their attention at first but once all is said and done, it's not something that gonna retain his attention. Guys usually like girls who are confident and knows what they want and I'm gonna show him just that! I'm going to work really hard at the gym and keep myself fit anf sexy and it will go from there. He'll see! If it doesn't work, then I guess I would just have to accept the fact that he's not the guy for me, which is going to be really hard!=((

       what a hectic week! My week was so full of activities! Monday was just fine; Tuesday, I went to PRC to apply but gov't offices was suspended in the PM so I didn't accomplish anything; Wed, I came to work late and went to a job interview at 3:30 PM and turned the offer down making up "time" as my excuse (I knew it beforehand that I was gonna turn it down); Thurs, I went to PRC again and fortunately I finished all the process and also enrolled in a review class(!); and today I'm having dinner with my whole family.

It is basically a good week for me. Janu and I also had a very nice talk on the phone (as usual, I was the one who called but it doesn't matter). I really had fun talking to him, he was such in a nice mood. And maybe I was in a light mood too so I didn't end up bugging him with all my dram and I guess that helped in his mood. I've never had that kind of talk with him for a long time and I truly missed that part of our rel. We talked about lots of things and even told me that I have to wear a veil when we got married. I told him "who said anything about getting married" and "see, you're the one who keeps on bringing that up and then you complain that I'm too serious" and we just laughed it out. I guess he missed me after that coz at the end of his day, he smsed me and said "goodnight. really love u" which is kinda new coz he doesn't do that anymore. But, he didn't reply my goodnight last night and I was kinda mad about it but I don't feel like complaining. The good thing is he came online except that I wasn't here when he did that. I guess he missed me and wanted to chat with me. That's a good sign. I'm thrilled.=)

        If you love someone, set him free. If he comes back, he's yours.  But, if he doesn't, he never was. Should I do that to Janu?

      I don't know whats wrong with my blog. I can't open my URL and my archive is messed up.  I hope there's nothing really bad and permanent going wrong with it.

Anyways, I had lunch with my close friends today, Che (fresh from Ireland!), Anna and Mharj. It was a good lunch coz Anna and Mharj hit it off immediately with Che, which is good coz they're from diff friend groups. I'm just a little shock with the bill coz I paid like Php800 for the four of us. In ordinary days, it's wouldn't have been that shocking but I'm kinda cash-strapped right now coz of what happened with my money (I think I mentioned it before). 

I also had a good chat with Janu. I was really mad at him yesterday for not coming online that I just ignored him last night. But, he came today and I was feeling depressed thinking that maybe he doesn't care at all. I actually spent the whole night wallowing in self-pity. I'm also kinda depressed thinking that I'm not getting any gift from him, not that I care about any material things, I just thought that it can be one measure of his love for me. I mean he may be thinking "why bother" or something like that. So, I wanna see his reaction and asked him when he's gonna send me his boxers and he said on my birthday. So, I guess he's planning to give me something. I hope so, but knowing him I don't wanna keep my hopes up.  A simple card would be more than enough for me as long as he's very sincere about his good wishes and intentions and love.

My boss gave me a bag (which I bought myself) and a Romance perfume (my choice).  Something happened though while I was talking to the communication girl. I had her on speaker and my boss and I started joking like we usually do coz he makes it a point to laugh about my being too conservative and told me that "now that I'm 26, then he can give me a kiss". I forgot that the phone is still on. So, she must have heard about what I said about the receipt of the bag and the change and the kiss joke. But, maybe I'm just being paranoid. There's nothing wrong with what we said, it's not as if we're being vulgar or something.  Anyways, I'm just being paranoid coz I know how Filipinos are, they're one hell of a gossip and I kept imagining her phone also on speaker mode and everyone at the communication center listening intently on the phone. It's such a crazy picture and I hope I won't get too paranoid coz I know I'm not doing anything of that sort nor am I the type who'll tolerate vulgar bahavior.  I have too much self-respect and conservatism to let something vulgar to just let it pass.

       Gemini Horoscope (Tue Jun. 3, 2003 by Astrocenter.com)  
 You have the ability to make some important breakthroughs in whatever project you set your mind to today, dear Gemini. Try not to get bogged down by your emotions, which may be feeling a bit heavy and stale. Infuse your day with a blast of unconventional thinking. Try to adopt a new and fresh attitude on whatever it is you want to get accomplished. A new perspective is all you need to make this day extremely productive.  

I'm tired of waiting...waiting for nothing. Fahim told me yesterday he thinks he has a fever. I never believe a word of it. But, I don't feel like arguing coz I'll never win anyway so I just said get well soon. Then last night I asked him how he is and hope he's feeling better but he didn't reply. Nor did he sms me today. I'm really really tired. I'm he doesn't want me then so be it. I'm giving up.

       love sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just changed my mobile phone's welcome note into "Life is Beautiful", but I don't think it will ever be that way for as long as I remain inlove with Janu. Now, I'm back with the "love sucks!" message. I really feel that love really sucks. My sisters' love life are all rosy and ideal, but mine is a mess. You can't even consider it as a "real" lovelife considering the fact that it is an online relationship. You can't even call it "relationship" anymore coz there's just no more connection in it like we used to. Now, I'm lucky if I can chat with him online once in a week. If I don't call him up, I'll never get the chance to talk to him coz he'll never make that move. Same with sending sms, it's always me who does that except for yest morning when he greeted me good morning. I'm really sick and tired of it actually. I just don't know how to move on without getting hurt. I guess what I'm doing right now is trying to delay getting hurt, but there will be no escapt from that pain. I know there isn't and I'm really terrified. I'm just afraid to get hurt again, it feels like I'm gonna go crazy and makes me wanna kill myself. No kidding, I used to think that way when I broke up with Erhiz.  I'm just scared of God so I can't kill myself. Besides, the fact that it's prolly painful to do that. Maybe there's a painless way to die.

Anyways, I don't know. I think I'm really pathetic right now. I smsed Janu last night twice and didn't get any reply. Then today I asked him if he can be online and to just tell me so I don't have to wait. Still, no reply. How low can you ever get? I've never been like this. I have to be really tough with him and not end up to be always the one begging for attention. It's sort of like I'm having a relationship with myself. Having conversations with myself. Sometimes I think that maybe he's trying to push me until I finally decide to break up with him. That way, he won't be guilty of anything. Maybe I should just do that, give him the cold shoulder. I wonder if he'll ever make a move when he doesn't hear from me for a week, month, or more. I have a feeling he won't give a damn. I wonder if he'll give me a gift or anything on my birthday. Would he give a damn about that? Let's see. Considering how he's been behaving, I don't think he will. Maybe he'll think I'm just not worth it.

Well, that's all for now. He still has not replied. I'm now drowning myself in self-pity. I wonder if someone will ever love me in a John Meyer kind of way.=(

           Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    High       urlLink Schizoid :    Low       urlLink Schizotypal :    High       urlLink Antisocial :    Moderate       urlLink Borderline :    Very High       urlLink Histrionic :    Very High       urlLink Narcissistic :    High       urlLink Avoidant :    High       urlLink Dependent :    Very High       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Moderate       --  urlLink Personality Disorder Test - Take It!  --     Paranoid
Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a distrust of others and a constant suspicion that people around you have sinister motives. People with this disorder tend to have excessive trust in their own knowledge and abilities and usually avoid close relationships with others. They search for hidden meanings in everything and read hostile intentions into the actions of others. They are quick to challenge the loyalties of friends and loved ones and often appear cold and distant to others. They usually shift blame to others and tend to carry long grudges.

Schizoid
People with schizoid personality disorder avoid relationships and do not show much emotion. They genuinely prefer to be alone and do not secretly wish for popularity. They tend to seek jobs that require little social contact. Their social skills are often weak and they do not show a need for attention or acceptance. They are perceived as humorless and distant and often are termed "loners."

Schizotypal
Many believe that schizotypal personality disorder represents mild schizophrenia. The disorder is characterized by odd forms of thinking and perceiving, and individuals with this disorder often seek isolation from others. They sometimes believe to have extra sensory ability or that unrelated events relate to them in some important way. They generally engage in eccentric behavior and have difficulty concentrating for long periods of time. Their speech is often over elaborate and difficult to follow.

Antisocial
A common misconception is that antisocial personality disorder refers to people who have poor social skills. The opposite is often the case. Instead, antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a lack of conscience. People with this disorder are prone to criminal behavior, believing that their victims are weak and deserving of being taken advantage of. They tend to lie and steal. Often, they are careless with money and take action without thinking about consequences. They are often agressive and are much more concerned with their own needs than the needs of others. 

Borderline
Borderline personality disorder is characterized by mood instability and poor self-image. People with this disorder are prone to constant mood swings and bouts of anger. Often, they will take their anger out on themselves, causing themselves injury. Suicidal threats and actions are not uncommon. They think in very black and white terms and often form intense, conflict-ridden relationships. They are quick to anger when their expectations are not met. 

Histrionic
People with histrionic personality disorder are constant attention seekers. They need to be the center of attention all the time, often interrupting others in order to dominate the conversation. They use grandiose language to discribe everyday events and seek constant praise. They may dress provacatively or exaggerate illnesses in order to gain attention. They also tend to exaggerate friendships and relationships, believing that everyone loves them. They are often manipulative. 

Narcissistic
Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by self-centeredness. Like histrionic disorder, people with this disorder seek attention and praise. They exaggerate their achievements, expecting others to recongize them as being superior. They tend to be choosy about picking friends, since they believe that not just anyone is worthy of being their friend. They tend to make good first impressions, yet have difficulty maintaining long-lasting relationships. They are generally uninterested in the feelings of others and may take advantage of them.

Avoidant
Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by extreme social anxiety. People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.

Dependent
Dependent personality disorder is characterized by a need to be taken care of. People with this disorder tend to cling to people and fear losing them. They may become suicidal when a break-up is imminent. They tend to let others make important decisions for them and often jump from relationship to relationship. They often remain in abusive relationships. They are overly sensitive to disapproval. They often feel helpless and depressed.

Obsessive-Compulsive
Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder is similar to obsessive-compulsive anxiety disorder. People with this disorder are overly focused on orderliness and perfection. Their need to do everything "right" often interferes with their productivity. They tend to get caught up in the details and miss the bigger picture. They set unreasonably high standards for themselves and others, and tend to be very critical of others when they do not live up to these high standards. They avoid working in teams, believing others to be too careless or incompetent. They avoid making decisions because they fear making mistakes and are rarely generous with their time or money. They often have difficulty expressing emotion.

      Horoscope:   You may find that the heaviness of the day is weighing on you, brenda. Take your time with projects and carefully evaluate all the facts before making a decision. People can be a bit deceptive today, so be careful in all your dealings with others. You may be going through a period right now in which you are caring less and less about material possessions and instead concerning yourself with things of a spiritual nature. This is a great time to delve into matters of the occult.

This was my horoscope yesterday...I haven't read it, just now and talk about coincidence. It made perfect sense! People are a bit deceptive? That must be Quens. As for being so low and depressed. I was. And Jan...as always...made me feel better. He finally called. It was more than what I've expected from him.  I didn't even expect him to sms me back!

      Birth Order Compatibility: Your Best -- and Worst -- Matches for Love
by Dr. Kevin Leman [http://www.ivillage.com/relationships/experts/experts_by_month/articles/0,9632,172420_285328,00.html]
First Born Married To A Middle Child: The danger here is that the middle-born may modify his or her own behavior to please the first-born mate. While the middle makes a good general match for anyone (except, perhaps, for another middle), she may find the first born to be somewhat intimidating and thus need drawing out. If you marry a hard-driving first-born, you may be inclined to give up your own desires and dreams to please your more dominant, first-born spouse. However, if you have last-born tendencies, this can be a very good match for you. 

Birth Order and Your Personality: 8 Facts That Might Surprise You
[http://www.ivillage.com/relationships/experts/experts_by_month/articles/0,9632,172420_285364,00.html]
First-Borns
Positives: They are natural leaders. They represent United States presidents, astronauts, and CEOs by overwhelming numbers. They frequently live with a sense of entitlement and even superiority. They often come in two flavors: compliant nurturers/caregivers or aggressive movers and shakers. Both are in control; they just use different methods. As a rule, first-borns are picky, precise people -they love paying attention to details -and they tend to be punctual, organized, and competent. They want to see things done right the first time. They don't like surprises. 

Negatives: They are often moody and occasionally lack sensitivity. They can be intimidating, particularly by pushing people too hard or refusing to take no for an answer. Sometimes they can be a bit of "know-it-all," and often are poor delegators, in large part because they don't trust other people as much as they trust themselves. They also tend to be bossy, flaw pickers, and conscientious to a fault. 

Middle-Borns
Positives: The classic middle-born is very relational, tends to be a people-pleaser and usually hates confrontation. Their basic need is to keep the oceans of life smooth, and their motto might be 'Peace at any price.' They are usually very calm, will roll with the punches, and are amiable, down-to-earth, and great listeners. They are skilled at seeing both sides of a problem and eager to make everybody happy. That makes them good mediators and negotiators. 

Negatives: They tend to be less driven than first-borns, but are much more desirous of having everybody like them -- or at least happy with them. They have a difficult time setting boundaries. They can drift into becoming 'codependents' as they try to please everybody. They are not good at making decisions that will offend others. They also tend to blame themselves when others fail.

       Where can my grandpa be? It is exactly 17 days since my grandfather went out for a walk and didn't came back.  He's been missing since the day of my birthday. =( Since then, we've (me and the rest of my family) been so busy looking for him. I can't believe something like this can happen to our family!

       The awakening? Am I a nymphomaniac or what? I met this guy (a different guy) over the net and he's not my type, but he gets into me. I mean he's so sexy and all... We did a cyber "thing" together although I didn't really get to the point where I touched my body parts and all but... Gosh! I felt something! The last time we had it, it was soooooooo hmmm...it's making me blush! But, soomething happened and I don't know what. He just disappeared from the face of the universe and I don't know if he's gonna come back. =( He was so into me and he wanted to do IT with me like all the time. BUT, that last spectacular one was the last time ever...I haven't seen him online once. =( I feel like he awakened the "woman" in me and left me yearning for more. No wonder some people can't stop doing it once they started... in real life!  Tha's why I don't think I'm gonna start at all or else I'll never be able to stop. It's like that Pringles commercial where the line goes "Once you popped, you can't stop!"

I don't know how is this guy different. Maybe he's good looking (?) or maybe coz he sent me pics of his "manhood" and it was soooooooo sexy.  And the way he does the cyber with me is so poetic... he even used words like "alas!".  Can you believe that? And everything is so descriptive! Maybe he changed his nick already and he does it like every week or until he gets tired of that "sex buddy". But I'm not tired of him yet! 

Don't get me wrong but I don't love him.  This is purely lust. I know coz I'm still hang-up on Janu.  I feel a little guilty sometimes but....he doesn't pay me enough attention.=( He doesn't pay me attention at all! He's in Florida right now and he told me yesterday that he'll come online for me when he gets at his cousin's place...but no sign of him ever.  I feel like crying!!! No Janu and no "sex buddy". I have no one.=(

      Life has been so hectic for me lately...But, now that my boss is away, I can relax a little bit and I'm looking forward to blogging regularly again. It doesn't mean though that I'm "free" to do everything that I want coz  knowing my boss, he's gonna perter me everyday all the way from Dubai or London or New York. It's just the way he is. Gosh!

Another thing is that, up until now we still haven't found my grandfather. The distressing part is that we don't know anymore where to look for him! We found some old man last night whom some "good samaritan" mistakenly thought is my grandfather, but when we went there...it was not him. :(( I'm so sympathetic about the plight of that old man, who reminds me alot about my grandfather esp. when he laughs. My lolo is prolly having the same fate. What's worst is that nobody might not want to give him shelter. :( I was thinking of taking that old man home with us and bring him to the home for the aged but I guess my mom doesn't agree so we didn't. We just left him at that stupid barangay hall. Damn thos government people esp those who's supposed to ber esponsible for this! It's an emergency case and all they think about is their stupid bureaucracy and the security guards act like they're the one in-charge! I was so dismayed and angry!!!!

       think vegan...think vegan... It's well-known that mind will always have power over your body..or in this case my taste buds! I don't know whether I've succeeded in becoming a vegan or I became worst. I think it's the latter, not because I like it. I just didn't have a choice. I went home last night to a dinner of chicken curry, and today to a fried porkchop breakfast. Gosh! I can't even do it as vegetarian! Lunch, however, was an improvement coz I had stir-fried vege and spicy potato. Thank goodness for this office, which has a corner for vegetarians...or rather Indians! The bad thing though is that I succombed to the temptations of Hersheys kisses and ended up buying two packs of Hersheys kisses cookies. It just taste so heavenly.  I wonder if the cocoa originated from Ivory Coast and if I'm eating a slave-prepared chocolate! I hope not!

Right now I'm looking for some recipes which I can prepare this weekend so I can eat it on week days.  That way I will have something to eat when I get home to my meatlover family.  Meat is just too haaaaaaaaaaard to resist! But, what the heck, I've only just began so it's only understandable. 

Anyways, I didn't know Alicia Silverstone and Julia Stiles are vegan.  That explains their gorgeous body and skin! 

Janu didn't come online today. There's no trace of him except for last night when he said goodnight back.  Anyways, I don't feel neglected or depressed or something.  I'm too busy thinking about my next "vegan" meal. :-)

       to be or not to be...vegan or vegetarian? I've read some great sites and blogs about being vegan and vegetarian (which I found out is toally two different things!) and I'm kinda thinking of becoming one.  I don't think I can become a vegan immediately coz it's definitely DIFFICULT, so I thought I'll start by becoming a vegetarian or a pollo-vegetarian. I still have not read lots of literatures about animal cruelty and all but I know I'll get there.  Maybe once I get convince, I would totally get rid of animal food and animal use from my life. 

My day is definitely a good one compared to yesterday...I guess it is getting better day by day.  I hope it goes on and on and I also hope this good vibes of mine will go on and help us find my grandpa.  I really felt better about going to the gym at lunch.  I felt light and not so heavy-hearted like I used to be, esp. in this kind of weather - like it's about to rain.  Maybe it has something to do with Janu, who said goodnight to me last night even without my initiating it. I didn't get to reply to him coz I'm already in dreamland.  I guess he didn't like it coz I always complain that he doesn't reply and now I'm doing the same thing.  I guess that's why he didn't come online today.  I didn't try to ask him why, not that I'm worried, but I said goodnight to him too to return the favor.  I guess being busy and preoccupied with things helped me.

I have to end this here. I have to head to the gym again and work some sweat out! :-)

       playing hard-to-get is hard I don't know how am I gonna play hard-to-get with a very hard-to-get guy. It's so infuriating! Last night I was very decisive about not calling Janu, but I can't help it so I gave him a ring just like a missed call. I was thingking that at least I'm not sening him an sms, so I'm still not breaking my "promise". But, how can he have such power over me that the moment he smsed "yes?" I was blurting to him back in sms! So, much for my WEAK self-control! I know I know it really sucks. And worst, he didn't even reply my "reply". It was so frustrating! I mean I broke my "promise" only to get no response from him. So, I sent another sms (oooohhh...not again!) and this time he replied. So, much for my unsuccessful ploy of hard-to-get.  Now, I'm off to another hard-to-get battle with him.  I hope this time he won't get into me. There's just something about his replies that makes u wanna reply back, while he totally ignores mine! Maybe there's something about my messages too that makes him don't wanna reply back. Gosh! Maybe I'm soooooooooo BORING!

Today, I took some pics of myself the old way, with all the film and all. I hope I'll look good in it. Hopefully, thinner than my last pic.  It would help give him a little motivation to pay attention to me coz the last pic I gave him was a total wreck! I was dark and fat and deshiveled coz I was at the beach that time.  I really really hope I'll look a little sexy in this pic or else...no pics to send him and no "motivation" from him too.=( With men, it's always about the physical. Those who keeps on saying that they're after the "inner beauty" is totally bull! They'll say anything to get inside ur pants "figuratively". Unless he's totally "un-pretty".

      My day today is a little better than yesterday.  Been quite busy so I guess I was just preoccupied.  I wasn't online this morning coz I was thinking of playing hard to get. But, I can't help it so I logged in and I got a message from Janu.  I guess it's better this way when you don't expect too much from people.  You won't get disappointed.  

I really feel very tired these days.  I don't know why but one of the reasons may be the fact that I still haven't made up the sleep that I lost last Saturday.  Or maybe there's something wrong with me.  I'm always very sleepy and tired.  Then, at lunch time I didn't have the appetite to eat anything.  I was too choosy.  It may be coz I'm about to have my period.  I don't know, but I hope there's nothing seriously wrong with me.  I have some pain on right breast right now.  It must be my period's coming up or my brassiere is too tight.

       just another day that sucks I woke up this morning with the realization that the person I love didn't even both to send a reply to my 2 sms last night.  I don't understand how someone can be THAT busy. I mean how long does it take for him to send a "goodnight, miss u 2" reply? It's not like he replies to me in detail. His reply usually automatic and without an ounce of sincerity.  I don't mean to be judgemental but I just feel it if he doesn't mean what he says.  It's like some automatic reply from an answering machine.

I stayed depressed the whole day today.  Must be due to the fact that I'm close to getting my "period" and my hormones are at its worst during these days.  Thus, making my ultra sensitive.  Add to that is the weather outside which seems to have a hard time deciding whether to pour or not.  So, it's kinda dark and gloomy...just not my type of weather at all. Another reason probably is the fact that today is the first month of my grandpa's disappearance. I just printed out some posters and liftlets a while ago and it's really adding to my depression.  I wanna find him soon.  I really miss him!

I've been online since this morning but I'm not chatting with anyone and it's not like it's my choice. Nobody just want to chat with me...except for old "reliable" jeff. But he's kind of a scatterbrain and it's hard to get his attention locked into you.  He has ADD so you prolly know what I mean.  He's a nice guy though.  He just depress me more coz he makes me feel bad about Janu. He reminds me that things aren't supposed to be the way it is with Fahim.:-( 

Now, I don't feel like going to the gym anymore.  I'm too depressed. I don't wanna go home alone, esp when it's dark.  It's too depressing.  Maybe I'll just make it up tomorrow at lunch.  From now on, I'll be working out twice a day. Tonight I'll just have to make do with the exercise video that I bought. It works with me anyway.  I can make me sweat and that's important.

I've registered in the Match.com website.  Just as the website says, it's a matching site.  I don't usually do this stuff but I'm so lonely right now.  I wanna feel wanted, loved or missed by someone.  This guy that I've been pining for a couple of days didn't show up anymore.  Not a trace of him anywhere.  I'm so sad and I feel like a crap.  Now, I can't go to Janu and complain about being sad and depressed.  He did called me just a couple of weeks ago when I felt low, but I don't thing he's gonna do it again at such a close distance.  How did I ever end up like this? I used to be such a pleasant, cheerful and "popular" girl. Now, I nothing but a pathetic and unloved loser!  Nobody's even courting me! And it's not as if they know about Janu.  They don't and still no one is courting.  I don't know what's wrong with me but I'm definitely not ugly.  Maybe they can see through my sadness and depression and they don't want that kind of crap with them.

Back to that match.com thing.  I uploaded my picture thinking that I was just gonna have a look at how it would look like.  But, unfortunately, I can't take it off.  I don't know how I'm gonna take it off.  All I know is that I have to or else it's one proof that I am definitely a loser.  Posting on personals to find the "right guy".  It's so pathetic.  Not to mention the fact that no one will prolly be interested with me. :-((

       what a shock! I can't believe the news that I got this morning. When I first heard about it, I tot it was a big joke! Maribel's pregnant?!%#$@ Life indeed is full of surprises!

I'm attaching my email to my janu about this so I don't have to duplicate what I just told him.  Kinda lazy I guess.

  was it only yesterday when i told you that i don't get depressed anymore? well, i haven't been depressed for a long time...until today. i have different set of friends: my high school friends, my college friends, my college roomies (who are my best buds), my childhood friends and my office friends. my high school and college roomies are the ones closest to me. 
 
anyways, i don't mean to bore u. it's just this call from one of my high school friends really shocked me. she told me that our friend (maribel) called her up and told her she's pregnant and told her to tell me. just writing about it makes me wanna cry. i can't believe how something like this can happen to her! she's the reason why im studying to be a teacher and we're always together in class on saturdays. her life is kinda depressing but i didn't know it's this depressing. her boyfriend of 4 yrs fooled around with a diff girl and she still gave him another chance, and still he again fooled around with another girl. so, i talked her into giving up on him and just give some other guys a chance...which she did! i guess that was a bad advice coz i never tot she's that lonely in her life and get too intimate with her new bf. 
 
i don't know why i'm writing this email in the first place. i guess i just had no one to talk to coz my friend who called me up is leaving for europe tomorrow. i'm just sad jan. i mean she's more "reserved" than i am. i mean i keep on joking with her about horny jokes and she was like "yuck jess, ur such a maniac". now, she's about to give birth in November! what's more depressing is that she broke up with that guy she hooked up with coz she found she's like gf # 2! how can you be cheated twice by two diff guys?! i don't wanna call her stupid coz who knows i might end up in her shoes someday. but, i don't know. i don't think i'm that weak and gullible. i mean when she told me this story about this guy courting her she was so giddy and all coz this guy sounds like he'll give up anything for her. give me a break! guys will always do that in courtship stage. they'll say anything the girls wanted to hear, right? 
 
now, she's pregnant, which i really really can't believe. it's not really like her to do that. she was so reserve even in her thoughts. she doesn't have a job and the stupid guy's family is like belittling her making everyone think that she's running after their precious son. so, she refused to marry him until he's ready. and what makes matters worst is that two weeks ago my sister and i were very nice to this guy (he's our childhood friend) coz he helped us look for my grandpa. if i only knew. he sweet-talked her and took advantage of her loneliness and vulnerability coz she just broke up with her longtime bf. it's like a case of bad luck! i mean how can doing "it" once make you pregnant right that instant?! some ppl do it lots of times even without protection and still not get pregnant! and it's such a waste to lose ones virginity to such an asshole! making love and bearing a child is supposed to be a happy occassion.
 
i'm really sorry for this. i know what ur gonna say, but it's like it's not even registering yet in my mind. it's like a big stupid joke. i wonder if it's really that difficult to resist temptation. i used to think i can handle myself in that kind of situation and not give up what i don't wanna give up. i did say no once so i don't understand why she didn't say no. is it that HARD? well, what do we know. we're still neophytes. all i know is that i don't wanna be alone in the same room with u or with any other guy. it's just tooooo dangerous! 
 
i feel a little better now. i just don't wanna keep all this garbage bottled up inside me. it's gonna use too much of my energy. i hope u were not too lazy to read this. ur my friend too, right?

      I started my day with a visit at the dentist. I want to or, rather, need to have my "jacket" replaced already considering the fact that it's 8 (?) years old now and it's getting yellowish already. I want my "great smile" back. I've never done that for a long time now coz I get conscious of my teeth. It's such a waste (I don't mean to be conceited...lol) but lots of people (guys mostly!) have told me that I have a great smile. There's even this one cute guy at the bank who told me to smile coz I look prettier when I smile.  I hope I can recover it back soon! The dentist told me I can go back and replace it on Wednesday. I hope she'll do it well or else it will be useless. Ph1,500 down the drain!

I guess you can say based on what you read on this journal that I'm trying to re-create myself. Isn't this what this new me is all about? Isn't this what this blog is all about? So, all you can read here are dieting and trying to make myself physically pleasing to the eye. I believe that my confidence will just follow suit coz once you feel that you look great, you'll feel good about urself too. Then performance will follow suit. Speaking of...tomorrow I'll be sending my complete set of application to the human resource people. I don't think they got my email anyway which is probably a good thing.

Nothing from Doods yet so far. I called him up again so as to point out the urgency of the situation. It's important that I show some sign of effort on my part to get intouch with him. I hope his boss will try to question him about this. He is really pissing me off!

Lastly, my baby came online today although he was late. He stayed for almost an hour but I don't feel like it. He told me we'll talk longer later. I hope so. I don't know what's going on between us, but I think we still love each other. We're just taking each other for granted, that's why. That's what happens when you don't foresee any problems so far. 

I have to go to the gym. I forgot to get reservation for aerobics. So, I better get going!

Till then!

      I wasn't actually planning to come to work today, but I guess my mom made me. I was supposed to go to the dentist this morning and I did but it didn't take too much time. The real work would happen tomorrow. The measuring and all. I was planning to go to the airport with my mom though but she kept on saying that I can still go to work.  So, I did. I don't know what she want anyway. It might be that she wanted me to say that I won't and that I'll just go with them but I haven't tot of that.  I tot that maybe she doesn't want me to come or I don't need to.

I did some fighting with my mom before she left though coz she was spending like left and right. it's not that it's my business and all. Heck, it's her money but I was hoping she'll keep track of her expenses just for the sake of keeping track and not feel like u don't know where your thousand pesos went.  She's really the exact opposite of my dad. I think I'm more of like my dad. I don't even know if I'll give Jan any presents for his b-day.  He didn't give me anything anyway. I guess I would, just for the sake of what we have or had, whatever it is. I think I still love him though.  

I did some chatting with two guys from match.com today and thay're kinda cool. The filipino guy at least, but he's 37 yrs old...too old for me. But, maybe we can be friends. It's not like I'm looking for a partner or a fling or whatever. I still believe I still got Janu and I'm still waiting.

Doods didn't get in touch with me yet.  Maybe I'll send him a letter tomorrow. That might be one way to communicate with him. I'm really getting pissed off with him.  I should have asked a receipt from him.  I trusted him way too much! Darn! 

Have to go now. I hope I can still catch the novena at 5:30. 10 mins more to go! Bye bye!

       doods... I'm meeting my mom in 5-10 mins at the mall so I'll be quick. I basically had a busy busy day and it's just fine with me. To hell with Janu for not coming online today. I don't know how to handle him anymore. I feel like this relationship is not a relationship at all. Like what else do we share with each other besides the goodnight greetings we say to each other once in a while? Nothing! We don't talk, we don't chat, we do nothing together. So, there really is nothing to treasure in this crappy relationship. I don't even know if I still love him at all. Sometimes I think maybe we do, we just need something to happen before we realize that we're both important to each other.

My title today is about Doos, not because I was thinking about him the whole day.  I was not. He was just my last thought today. I'm planning to send him a "warning" email telling him that he can't get away from his debts. I mean 20 thousand bucks is 20 thousand bucks (in pesos) but still... I can't beleieve, or maybe I hate to think, that he can do something like this to me. This really SUCKS big time!

I guess that's all for now. Btw, that guy at match.com gave me an email today. I decided to reply only to find out that you have to pay some fees in order to send an email. Damn! This matching sites are just fool of crooks. I wonder if he'll get the hint and just chat with me online instead.

       my dream I had this really weird dream couple of nights ago, it was so vivid and I can still remember everything clearly. We were at home and it was a two-storey house but the steps are too steep and not properly constructed. It's like when you go down, you have to hold on to something coz you can't see the next step when you get down. Then I was so insistent that it get repaired no matter what and it was repaired at the end of my dream. Actually, I think I woke up in the middle of it and the repair happened the second part when I went back to sleep. Pretty weird, huh?

Well, I went through the net and found this interpretation from  www.dreammoods.com :
 Steps
To see steps in your dream, represents your efforts in achieving your goals, ambition and material gains.  The dream may be telling you to take things one thing at a time. Or that you need to take a chance and take that first step toward your goals/dreams. 

I looks like a good dream esp. since I made an effort to have it repaired. And it's also a good coincidence coz I just finished filling-up the application form the Bank where I work at. Maybe this was the sign I was waiting for to finally apply for a regular position. I'll do everything in my power to get this job. Heck, it pays like 100% more than my present salary and a free gym class to boot! What more can you ask for? My grandpa to come back! Dear Lord, please let him come back!!! And also to finally see my Janu, which I might be able to do when I get this job., with this salary and all!

       i feel like i'm gonna be sick! I've been trying to call my mom and at last she replied! I don't feel like going home alone today. I don't feel depressed or anything but I don't wanna go home alone. I feel sick and under the weather. I have this terrible terrible cold and I've finished like one roll of tissue already...just an estimate though. I've checked my match.com profile and 2 ppl have winked at me. 2 our 169 who viewed my profile! Man! Am I that uninteresting?lol It's no big deal really coz I know they wanted someone with the pic in it. What I have there is my dog.lol I'm not worried though. I'm not really serious about this thing. I just wanna meet some friend and widen my knowledge about diff cultures and ppl. It's not like I wanted to meet someone and strike up a relationship or something. I'm still hang-up on Janu although I'm kinda preoccupied right now. It's a good thing really coz I don't toss and turn at night just because he didn't say goodnight to me. He did say goodnight to me thought today. I guess he does miss me sometimes...and loves! So, there's really nothing to get depressed about. Besides, maybe the food I'm eating nowadays helps alot...all veges! Except for this morning...I have fried pork. :(( I had no choice coz I was running late and hungry! Tomorrow, I'll do better.

       YIPEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! This is absolutely a veeeeeeeery happy day for me. Well, it's more like yesterday and today is absolutely the two happiest days of my life! You know why????? Coz.... we finally found my grandpa !!!!!! Eeeeeeeeeeee!!! I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO happy! Isn't it obvious?! Hehe! GRABEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!

Ok, I'll try to calm down... here's what happened: I went to the dentist in Villamor yesterday after, but the dentist didn't show up or was not there so I was so pissed off on my way home. So, we stopped by at the nearest mall and splurged, then, got home at 6pm. I can't remember what I was actually doing that time but I remember my cousin who lives with us screeching and calling us from outside our gate. She was hysterical and calling us to come out. And I tot like "oh, this better be a good one!" and tot that maybe there was some stars shooting in our vicinity which is soooo farfetched, but who knows...the way she screeched ul prolly be thinking the same think. Then, I saw this white tinted van outside and my cousin was looking inside and I looked inside too and surprise of all surpirses! There was my grandfather in the front seat!!!! GOSH!!!! I was like practically jumping for joy. I can't believe what I'm seeing. It's like a mirage!!! I don't know what to think like I can't seem to comprehend how my other cousin have my gandpa. I didn't know they were looking for him anyway, esp. on weekdays. But, I was too happy to think about that. So, I went to the front of the van practically jumping with glee and went to sit beside my grandpa coz they're bringing him to my aunt's house. I'm soooooooooo happy I feel like crying just writing about it. Who wouldn't considering th fact that he's been lost for 1 month and 16 days!!! I kept praying soooo hard I don't know how to pray much harder anymore. It is a miracle that we found him... ALIVE! I kept imagining him very weak, can't talk, can't stand and almost dead on the road, but thank GOD he's not. He may be a little weak (hello! he's 81 years old what do u expect!) but I hope his health would get back to normal.  Too bad he can't remember anything from his "adventures". Where did he sleep? What have he eaten? Too many questions that will prolly be never answered.

Another good thing is that Janu and I had a very good chat.  He said "really really love u" today which is like he has not done it in a looooooooong time. I can't even remember when he has last said that "really really" thing. I know it's silly but.... *grin*.  Ohhh, I love him so!

One more thing, (see there's more! hehe) I also got an email from Inese! I can't ask for anything more! Prayers really do wonders. I haven't prayed this hard in a very long time. Thanks Mary and Jesus!

I guess there will always be a rainbow in every storm. 

I don't even wanna think about that stupid 20T that Doods still owe me.  I guess there are just things that's more impt than money. Love and family. I guess he doesn't have both. Anyways, I just hope he'll come to his senses and pay me. I still need that money. *sigh*

       humaharurot That's the name of the storm right now. It's storm season again so there will be more to come. This particular storm tho is pretty powerful - I heard it's signal 4 in some provinces in the north. Gee! I hope it won't last long. It's more wind than rain though which is a good thing, but still...I keep thinking about lolo. Where can he be right now? I wonder if he's crying.:-( He cries sometimes you know, specially when he's alone or when he thinks he's lost. I can't help but think about him everytime it rains, much more when there's a typhoon. WHERE CAN HE BE??? Will I ever pass through this feeling everytime there's rain or storm? Maybe I will, as long as he's not yet found.

I've done some research on the net about "alzheimer's" and every symptoms points to lolo. I don't know why we haven't tot about this before when he got lost first two times. We could have prevented this. Regret...regret... When you're not proactive, regrets will all be there! I hate myself for not even initiating this research. I research on the most useless topics like love, men, etc. and I have done research on the most important matters! I wonder what else should I have been researching about?

Janu's birthday is two days from now. I wonder if he's expecting some gift from me coz I told him I wanted to give him something.  Well that was before, when I was not yet this penniless. I just sent him this card (which by my current standard is already expensive), this "iloveu" lion and a cd which I burned with Daniel Bedingfield's song. I hope he'll like it. I was suppose to include 2 boxers but I can't afford it now. Anyways, I don't think it matters to him. I sent him a card recently and he didn't even say thank you. So, I don't know if he got it or not. It's kinda disappointing.:-( I really hope he'll like my gift. It's too simple but very sincere.  It will break my heart if doesn't say anything about it. :-((

I think I have to start heading for the gym. It's really crazy outside with the wind and all. I hope I won't get stranded when I go home. It happens to some.  But, I wanna avoid the rush so I'm staying at the gym instead and go home later.  No point in going home early when it's difficult to get a ride, right?

Ok, gotta go! Tata!

       bad luck, bad karma...whatever! I don't know why all these stuff is happening in my life. Is He trying to punish me for something that I did bad? Is this a test of my faith? I don't know why it's all coming in droves. I wanted to cry just thinking about it!

First, my grandfather got lost and is still missing until today. It has been exactly 1 month and 14 days since that fateful day. How can I forget it? It was my birthday! And all these bad "happenings" started on that day!

Second, my supposed "friend" ran away with my Ph20,000! Now, I don't know where to find him! Then, last Friday I lost my wallet at the restroom of the MRT. I mean this thing seldom (or never!) happens to me! I've never placed my wallet on the counter of any restroom in my whole life then just forget about it! It's just not me.

Then, my friend got pregnant. Well, it's not actually happening to me but...still. Sometimes, when I think about it, I feel like I've caused this "pregnancy" on her. It sometimes happens that the person I'm really irritated...or maybe pissed off with encounters some "unfortunately incident".

I don't know what to think right now. I'm just so in deep financial TROUBLE! It's not really like I owe someone something and they're after me. I'm just really broke. My mom didn't give me enough money to run the household while she's gone. And Janu's b-day is the day after. I don't even have a gift for him. :( I was hoping I could give him boxers, but I guess I can't do that. I don't even know if I could afford sending him even a birthday card. If I don't use my boss' account, I wouldn't even be able to call him up and greet him happy birthday. I guess I have no choice but to use it now. It's not like I'm used to it by now. I feel like a thief doing this. Come to think of it, maybe all these misfuortune is happening to me coz I'm a BIG thief! I better stop using other people's account to call my bf! This would be the last time really!!! I'm sorry dear Lord for doing this. I'm just so over worked and underpaid and it's not like my boss would feel this little expense from his enormous wealth. He only wastes his money anyway. ight as well, do something useful with me.  Ok, ok, there's no excuse for "stealing" and I'll try to change this UGLY behavior!

Have to go for my workout. See yah!

       too complicated? I dunno who is more complicated, me or mel? It's either I'm too hard to understand or she's too complicated. I don't get it why she keeps on getting angry and gives me those stupid "punch lines" with the exclamation point to boot, but all I know is that when she does that it pisses me off! I mean, who gave her the right to behave like that with me? Does she want me to remind her that she's the one who keeps on "begging" me not to leave her? Not to mention the fact that she keeps on promising that she never gonna do it again...blah blah. It's really infuriating that after all the begging ang the promising she has the nerve to "yell" at me and be snotty with me! We just fought about Janu lately and she said sorry after I told her I don't like it that she accuses me of stupid things about Janu and that it's better if we just forget about each other. So, she begged and gave all kinds of promises and today she says "doon ka na kay Janu mo!". Again!!!! Goooooooooossshhhh!! She makes me so mad!

About that Brian thing, she gave him up (again!) and I hope it's for good coz I'm kinda tired of saying the same things over again everytime we fight about him.  don't know why she can't keep her words. I mean she says one thing and does another thing. I asked her a favor about Doods today (I got his home address already, thank God -- and Ryan too!) and she told me she will inquire about it and that I just have to wait. She's so unreliable that I dunno until when am I going to wait. Sometimes I think she has some attention deficiency something. I mean how can she say something and totally forget about it the next time you talk about it? It's really weird. Either that or she's just way too stupid than I tot. Whatever it is, I hope she'll just stop doing this irritating things or else I would have to really finally leave her. It's just not worth all the trouble. 

Speaking of Janu, I had a talk with him and got so depressed I cried myself to sleep. Just two days of not working out and I'm now back to being depressive. Gosh! Anyways, what got me depressed is that he kept on saying "my wife" instead of referring "my wife" to "me". It's like he's really pretty sure that it's not gonna be me. He used to say when we're married blah blah but now it's "my wife".:(( The he said he doesn't want to get married. Am I not worth it??? Good thing when I got to work (I was depressed all the way here) I got his "PM" from yesterday and it was kinda sweet. He thanks me for the (take note...) "beautiful card". I'm glad he liked the card coz it really is cute! I hope he'll like the cd (which is too much to hope for!) and the talking lion (too bad he still didn't hear the lion's msg). It's pretty silly actually but I hopes he likes it. It was kinda nice and sweet of him too to come online today after his exam...esp since I had to drag him back after 10mins of my not being here. 

I guess this is it for today. Btw, I have my new jacket already. I hope it wouldn't be too obvious when I smile. It feels heavy though but I guess I'll get used to it.

Bye and I hope I'll have a nice weekend!

       goodbye mel I've said goodbye to melanie countless times, after all we fight like almost everyday. So, I'm kinda wondering how come we're still friends after all this time. But today, I just felt like this time it's the final coz reason is too much of a big deal for me.

I dunno if you'll agree with me, or it is just me, that when we love someone we always end up forgiving them like countless times and given them 2nd, third and nth chances. Sometimes it gets too frustrating coz it seems that they just keep on doing it over and over and that when the "unforgiving" comes. In mel and myself's case, we had a really huge fight only last week and she "begged" me to forgive her after I kept on rejecting her calls and not answering her sms. She said she'll really make it up to me this time (the hell she did when she first promised me that!) and now a week later she's again very "arrogant" and back to her old habits. How dare she raise her voice on me or even start accusing me of something again! And worst, which is actually the reason why I'm finally leaving her, she got back with her ex-boyfriend whom I really really hate so much it's beyond words! I mean how can she even consider getting back with him knowing that it's gonna piss me off. Besides, I've already told her that that ex-bf of hers called me and "evil person"! Can you believe that?! Aren't you supposed to stick together when somebody badmouths your friend? I can't believe this!!!! A few weeks ago after some fight on which she made her promises again, she even told me that she'll forget about that idiot and do what I wanted her to do. And now, after having some talk with him last night she just said "alright" to him! Damn her!!! I'm so aaaaaaaaaaaangrrrrrryyyyy right now!

The bad part is that she can't even answer my sms immediately. I had to give her a call just to get her reply as to what she told brian! And she was being sooooooo haughty about it like "so what?". Ya right, tell me so what we're over bitch!!!

Gosh! I'm so trembling with anger right now. I don't think she really cares if I'm mad or not. It's all about her stupid American dream!!! She may deny this but I can see through her! She didn't even reply to my goodbye speech! Damn her!!!!
I feel like strangling somebody! Gosssssssssssshhhhhhhhh!!!!

I don't know if it's worth a try to end this blog on a happy note but I'll try. I said goodnight to Janu last night but he didn't reply. I guess he's busy coz I remember him saying that this week is his finals week. Anyways, he came online today but unfortunately I was out galiavanting at the mall. What can I say, I can't live my life around him right? At least, it makes me happy that he came online. I wonder if he'll come again tomorrow coz I won't be here. 

K, got to go now. I'm attending the novena mass. I hope this mass will help me make all this evil thoughts go out of my system. Bye!

      I must say that this new format for posting is cool and has better presentation than the old one. I just hope they have cooler templates too.;) As of now, they only have these plain templates so I'm just sticking with my current one.

I have particularly nothing to talk about, but I feel kinda anxious although I can't quite point it out why. It's not really in the conscious level but I know underneath I have lots of problems. It's just not surfacing yet. All I know is I'm getting tired of the life I'm living right now: lousy job, online relationship, limited finances, etc. It's just not the kind of life that I want. I wish I have more money to spend. Hell, I don't know if I'll ever be able to afford a family! I'm 26 and before I know it I'll be 27!!!

So, what will I talk about? I keep thinking about my grandfather and how it's a pity that noone among his children seems to want to take care of him. I mean I can't believe that my mom would even think of such an option - bringing my grandfather to Tarlac and make some distant relative take care of him at a fee. Is that the same as trying to get rid of him? Can't we just take care of him by ourselves?! It's not as if he has lots of years still to live. Can't we, his bloodlines, take care of him in his last remaining years in the world. For goodness sakes! He took care of us all well. We wouldn't have been where we are now if it was not for him. We owe him a lot!!!

It's so frustrating how they seem to try to pass him on to each other like a ping pong! And uncle Jun is the worst! I mean he's earning big bucks and yet he couldn't have cared less about everything. After we found lolo he came for a visit then nothing. He didn't even inquire if he was taken to the hospital already (which we still have not) or even bring his family to visit lolo. What are they waiting for? When it's too late??? When was some extracurricular activities more important than your father?! I can't believe the kind of family we are. I have never imagined that we have this kind of family. It's embarassing to admit! Does this mean that the concern ends at the time when we found lolo? Hell, they were all worried when he was still missing, and now that he's found - nothing! Shouldn't the continue and try to correct the mistakes that they did before that happened? I don't know what to say!:( I really feel for lolo. It's a pity really esp. when you see him sleeping at the sofa and nobody caring for him. Does he feel that hes' unwanted? I don't know.

Btw, before I end I wanna tell you that Janu replied my goodnight sms by telling me that he's still very sleepy and wish that he can sleep with me in bed. He has not done that for a long time. I can feel our love getting warm again. I hope this will go on until we see each other in person. I just felt that he's the perfect guy for me and I think we'll really have a blast when we're the together. The only hurdle is how can we be together. I hope he's really working hard on it. I really love him so.

      What happened again to the setting? New format? It just keeps changing. I just hope I won't lose any of my posts.  I think I'd better start printing my old blogs or else....coz this blog now serves as my diary (I don't write anymore on my old journal. Anyways, this day sucks.  Aunt wilma told anicia that lolo should stay with us coz we have his retirement anyway. It was shocking and I was mad! It ruined my day! It was as if nobody wanted to take care of lolo! Fine if they don't wanna take care of him, we will!!! Bloody idiots!!!

       love is a rollercoaster Besides life, love can also be considered a rollercoaster ride, esp. if your riding it with Janu. He is just so full of inconsistencies! Last night he was so sweet (ok, it was an extension of the other night) that I felt so guilty about flirting with another guy on the net much more dream about him in a horny kind of way. Anways, back to inconsistent Janu, he asked me wether paying $100 a month for the whole year of gym is good and wise and we talked about it like "normal" couples do. I have never felt so closer to him. I mean it made me feel like my advice is important. He had never asked me for advice before and he thanked me for clearing things up for him. He just have this power over me you know. Like I'm always craving for his attention, his approval and everything. It's silly but I felt like we're married already.lol I remember he once told me that (long long time ago) during one time when I told him about my problems and all that and he said he liked it coz he flet like we're married already. I guess this is how he felt during that time.

But today...today...what did he do today? Nothing. He's back to his coldness. I don't really wanna take this things seriously or else I'll go crazy and get all depressed and everything. I just know him by now and he's just this type of person but I know he loves me. I think he does. Maybe this is just how men show their feelings to you. If they're not inconsistent and being a jerk then they're being pretentious of their nature.lol You just can't force them to do something they don't like or else they'll only be doing the exact opposite. And what more it'll just be the beginning of the end. If they're still with you then I guess they still love you. 

Anyways, I had a fight with Mel last night. I don't know it just piss me off when she behaves like this with me. She's being snotty and she said "what the hell..." like I'm just some sort of stupid fellow. I don't know what's with her but it really pisses me off. I mean I've never been as patient as I've been these past few days when I try to ignore her outburst and still text her but she's going too far. Maybe my not getting angry with her outburst made her thing that he had the upperhand. Well, she's wrong. I'm just tired of fighting so I'm taking the initiative not to lose my temper too. Another thing is that after I let her finished her relationship with Brian, she's talling me again about this nice guy blah blah...I mean what's with her? Is she boy crazy? I can't believe her! So, I tired to rationalized with her and be calm and asked her to do all those things I asked her to do and it looks like she did. Then she made another mistake again (she just never give up, doesn't she?). She asked for my email add at yahoo and I don't know why. I've given her my othe "permanent" email and she still burst out "forget it". The nerve! She has no right to get mad at me esp. since she told me she wanted to hack my email. Then why would I give it her when I didn't even open hers?! Gosh! She's just so irritating! But I'm just tired of arguing with her. She's a little bit of a scatterbrain so I don't think I'll put some sense into her brain. 

On another "subject", Charles didn't come online again today. I guess he's back to his "MIA" behavior. I wonder why he talk to me for a couple of days...loss of "sex buddy"? No matter what, he gonna get an earful when he comes back (if he comes back). Men! They're just so complicated. Btw, let me just set the record straight that I didn't missed him (I would never lie on my journal!) I was just bored. He entertains me and feeds my ego.lol

That's all for today folks. It's Friday again so I won't be blogging Sat and Sun again. I hope I can study the whole night today coz I have to do a lot of catching up! Oh men! I also hope Janu would give me a call. It's the weekend and he told me he'll give me a call. I'm crossing my fingers for that. Knowing him... OK, ok, I'll give him some benefit. =)

       am i a cheat? Is it supposed to be cheat or cheater? I'm not so sure if cheat is grammatically correct or not but what matters is if I've cheated on my Janu. Remember when I told you yesterday that Turnintojello is back? Well, we're back too (not back together coz I refuse to be "exclusive" with him. I'm only exclusive to Jan.). We're back in the sense that we're back to doing our "monkey" business. This time he professed that he's inlove with me. Gimme a break! It's really funny how he pleads with me. I don't know whether to believe him or not. Anyways, it's not as if it matters to me. My heart belongs to only one person and that my Jan (my life).  This is just some kind of "flirtation" that happens on the net. I just hope he's not serious coz he's really such a nice guy.  He even showed me his old pic with his parents. How sweet can that be!

He told me he was sent for a whole month of training and was sent to Iraq for reinforcement. He doesn't want to talk about it in detail coz he said he doesn't want to think about it coz it's all about death, sufferings and diseases. So, I didn't pressed him about it. I don't want to cause him distress (who knows it might be true). I really like him a lot. I mean he's goodlooking and way toooo sex in "bed", but when I'm inlove with someone it's hard (nearly impossible) to penetrate my heart. I hope Jan would start giving me the kind of attention that I deserve.:-( 

I don't think I can stay much longer. Still have to go to that novena mass. Bye!

 P.S. Looks like there's another "strong" typhoon! It's dark and raining outside.

       love is a many splendored thing? I don't know how the song goes but it just came into my mind when I was thinking what a wonder LOVE is. Just a few moments ago I was so down and lonely and reconditioning my mind that I'll never end up with Janu anyway so might as well start forgetting about him and so on.... I was also angry at him for making me look like a fool last night coz I tot he was the one who called me (it was an international call which says "no number" on my phone).  My mind was like made up that I'll never sms him again or give him a call unless he makes the first move all the time and then he came online and ....POOF! Everything was gone, just like that! Oh men! What powers does he have over me that I seem to always forget my resolve the instant we start "talking".

So there goes...he made me really happy again. I wonder how can he have such power over my moods that he can make me happy just by talking to me. Oh my! This is bad....really bad! But really, it is a good chat session for us and he did come back after his dinner. Unfortunately, I left to have my lunch already.

Then came this guy turnintojello. I kinda forgot his name coz we stopped chatting for couple of months now and we only chatted for like 3 days. He just left me hanging the last time we chatted and now he's back and said he "wants me back". As if! I mean we're never really an item so I don't know how you can have something back that wasn't really yours in the first place. And he was making up all these stories about having a one month training and going to Iraq for reinforcement for 3 months. I mean it's pretty silly when you think about it. WHat does he take me for? Stupid? Everything he said just doesn't add up. There's no way you can be some reinforcement in Iraq for only "3 weeks"! I think it takes longer than that...probably months!

I had a talk with Mel and as usual we disagreed on lots of things. I told her I wanna live this forsaken place next year or before the year ends and she asked me to give her time. She said she needs to think this over blah blah. For goodness sakes! She's been telling me to give her time for the last couple of years! How much time does she need? Why not make a concrete plan and try to work it out through the plan. I don't know how her mind works but she made it seem like I was so impulsive that I had to this this over. I've never been impulsive in my whole life and she's wrong in thinking that way. In fact she's the one without planning. She keeps on saying "give her time" without any specific timeframe on her mind. When does she want to activate her plan? When we're 30?! Before she new it 4 years are over and we're 30. So, I told her I'll be leaving next year with or without her (I didn't say that last part loud though).

Btw, they've taken lolo to the hospital at last although it's a private one so we had to pay.  My sister told me that her medicine would cost like P1,600+! That's too much but that's how hospitals work...they'll kill you with the medicines! I hope there's supplies like this in Mel's office.  If not, then I would have to ask uncle jun to shoulder it. For goodness sakes! It's his dad! It seems like they have totally forgotten about lolo's existence eversince he was found. It's so frustrating!!!

I think this is all for now. I hope luck will be on my side this time once I start looking for opportunities abroad! Have to remind myself too to study harder than I am doing right now. The LET is gonna be 3 weeks from now and there are still lots of things to study about! God help me!

      There are many instances during the day when I'm almost close to tears. It's such a gloomy gloomy day for me because I've never felt so unloved as I do now. First, Janu didn't even give me a call (as he told me he would after I asked him too) and second, Mel was not really concerned about my happiness ( asked her if I can find a job in Malaysia coz I'm not happy anymore and she just told me to wait coz she's not yet ready. Lucky for her she's enjoying her job and I'm not! So, I can't wait any longer!). And this coming from two people who professed their love for me. It's really sad and I felt like a real bigtime LOSER! This was really magnified by the fact the Larisse, who is Mharj's friend is about to become a "Workshop Consultant"! Just as I've said before "how come it seems as if I'm the only one not getting any good stuff happening to me?" It's sad really and I can feel the weight of my age now...4 more years and I'm 30!

I better get my act together and not hold on to their love anymore. Expecting too much from them just make me hurt more. I feel like giving in to this feeling of self-pity right now. But it will only make matters worst and make me depressed even more! I have to be strong!!! To hell with them!!! :-(

      I've read somewhere that jealousy is not a sign of love, but of selfishness. If that's the case then I must be a very selfish person. Actually, I'm not denying that I'm a very selfish person. I've known that fact long ago. My ex-bf have made it pretty clear to me when he dumped me. Well then, how come he still wanted me back after a couple or so years after? Whatever the reason, I'll never know. I don't think he's telling me the truth when he answered that question. Anyways, it's spilled milk now and there's no turning back. I didn't give him the second chance that he wanted. Ok ok, it must have been fueled by my anger and my need for revenge for hurting me so badly, but really I don't love him anymore. The first time he wanted me back (a year after) I was still inlove with him, but after 3 yrs and having found Janu, I don't think so. On both occasions I said no.

Heck, why am I talking about him anyway? I was supposed to talk about Melanie. We have another fight (as usual) but it's no big deal. I know we're gonna make up again after a while. We always do. Well, she's the other person who told me I'm selfish. The rest, I can't remember. If Two or more have told you that you're a selfish person it gets pretty tiring to hear it. So, everytime they tell me "you're being selfish", I just reply "I know, so what?". It's a bitch reply I know but what can I do? I didn't say, nor even pretended, to be angelic. I'm just the jealous type (as in!!!) and I get really CRAZY and LETHAL when jealousy gets into me. But, I don't if the saying about jealousy as not a sign of love is an absolute truth. I mean why would you be jealous if you don't care about that person? To hell with them.

Anyways, I haven't heard from "sweet" Janu. He's probably dreaming about some girl right now. Ok, ok I don't really mean that. Call me naive (and conceited?hehe) but I can't imagine him dreaming about some other girl but myself.lol Actually, I don't think he's dreaming about anybody right now. How can I be so sure? Well, I just know the type of person that he is. He thinks about nothing at all.lol And most of the time he's too tired to think.

Well, I've eaten too much today and it really sucks considering that I'm planning to stop working outfrom Wednesday. I'm just too busy. I ate this mongolian noodles then had a craving for chocolates. So, I ended up eating this veeeeeeeeeeeeeery delicious chocolate ganash cake. It's so yummy like an ice cream cake. I still feel so heavy until now. I think I'll try to do some taebo when I get home just to burn some calories (not to mention all those fat content!). I have to get down to 100 lbs or else...nothing. Just trying to be overly dramatic here.lol But I'm really serious about losing weight and getting down to 100 lbs! I hope it's gonna happen soon! 3 months in the gym and all I lost was some lousy 4 lbs! I wonder how long will losing 9 lbs take! Waaaaaaaah!

Ok, gotta go. I can hear Mharj coming over here.

      Delamar (from the morning rush) really loved the song "I'm still here" by Vertical Horizon, so it kinda piqued my interest and made me look for the lyrics. Del said it's really deep and I guess she can relate to it very much. Thus, the reaction. The song goes like this:

 I found the pieces in my hand 
They were always there 
It just took some time for me to understand 
You gave me words I just can't say 
So if nothing else 
I'll just hold on while you drift away 

Cause everything you wanted me to hide 
Is everything that makes me feel alive 

CHORUS: 
The cities grow the rivers flow 
Where you are I'll never know 
But I'm still here 
If you were right and I was wrong 
Why are you the one who's gone 
And I'm still here 

I'm still here 

You've seen the ashes in my heart 
You smile the widest when I cry inside and my insides blow apart 
I try to wear another face 
Just to make you proud 
Just to make you put me in my place 

But everything you wanted from me 
Is everything that I could never be 

(chorus) 

Maybe tonight it's gonna be alright 
I will get better 
Maybe today it's gonna be okay 
I will remember 

I held the pieces of my soul 
I was shattered 
And I wanted you to come and make me whole 
Then I saw you yesterday 
But you didn't notice 
You just walked away 

Cause everything you wanted me to hide 
Is everything that makes me feel alive 

(chorus) 

The lights go out the bridges burn 
Once you go you can't return 
But I'm still here 
Remember how you used to say 
I'd be the one to run away 
But I'm still here 

I'm still here 

I guess it really is deep...kinda very sad. I don't wanna be in the situation (again!). God forbid, but I really know how it felt. No word can describe the pain and it makes me crazy that I can't seem to just make the pain go away, no matter what I do. Ok ok...I guess I got carried away. I'm talking about my ex-bf. Well, it's a long story and today is not the day for that long story.

Anyways, back to Del. I think she's in that phase right now. That "I'm-in-the shit-hole" phase whatever that is. But, I heard her once said on the radio (she was kinda whining that time) that there was this guy who used to court her but she showed him an image of "disinterest" that he just gave up. And now she's so full of regret. That really sucks don't you think. But, these things happen...sadly. So, I guess that's why she liked the song. Oh well, Love...so complicated and it can make you REALLY HAPPY. Nothing will ever have the same effect on you as love does.

Jan and I didn't chat today but he did said goodnight to me. Thank goodness for that. Actually, I bugged him about it last night. Hehe. I was really trying to control my urge not to make the first move and sms him, but I guess I'm a weak human being. I gave in to that urge after fighting with my thoughts for 5 mins (?), hehe. Well, I'm not that weak. It took me half an hour of control and I even deleted his number from my phone to keep me from doing the "unthinkable?". Oh well (sigh), it really didn't help that I know his number by heart. I don't if it's just me or we women just have this in us like we can't control our fingers or something. I used to have the hots for this guy who looks like Gary Estrada (I think he likes me too), but I don't know why I just can't wait for him to make the move. I remember sitting by the phone trying to decide whether to call him or not. Gosh! It's so pathetic. Then, fortunately, he called before I even give in to the devil. Hehe!

Oh well, love.  Mahirap pero masarap . Hehe! Silly me. I just thought of it coz it rhymes. =)

      I found this really cool blog maybe because I can relate to what she's going through. I'm putting a link to it when I have the time. It's at  http://pinkattic.blogspot.com/ . 

Anyways, today is a typical very lazy day for me. Lazy because I don't think I've done anything productive today. I mean I didn't do much at work the whole day. I just printed some notes in Geography then attented the ISO briefing in the PM. It's cool though coz I get to socialize once in a while. Well, it's not like I talked to a lot of people or even get to meet lots of people. Socializing here means just being with all these people I supposedly work with in the same environment which I've never got the chance to see. My office is kinda out of people's way so I don't get to be around too many people like in some corporate world. 

After that, Jane and I went down for cappucino and made some "tsismis" and it was fun. I don't get to do a lot of that stuff when my boss is here, which reminds me that my happy days are soon to be over. He's gonna be back on the 21st, which is like a little more than a week! Gosh! Time really flies and I still have so much to do!

I'm such a busy person nowadays. I have to accomplish like too many things at the same time. I have my review to think about then I still have to prepare our Newsletter which is gonna be published in September. Gosh! I feel a little panicky now. Too bad Mel doesn't seem to understand the urgency that I'm feeling. I mean we fought agian last night just because I told her I'll talk to her some other time coz I still need to study. Gosh! Sometimes she just make me lose my patience!

Oh my, it's 5:12 PM already?! I better hurry or else I'll miss the novena in church!

Bahbooh!

      It's almost 5:00 PM or exactly 4:53 and it's so quiet here in the office. I wanted to cry. I'm sooooooooo depressed. =(( I wanna talk to Jan but I know I can't always turn to him whenever I feel this way. I don't wanna look too weak and clingy. 

I really hate going to the gym alone. It's so depressing. Mharj hurt her toes during a pedicure so I guess she won't be visiting the gym this week (I hope not that long thought!).

OK gotta so...I  better get going so I can forget about being sad.

      I have so much to talk about that I don't know where to start. Maybe I'll start with what happened yesterday since I forgot to blog before I went home. I was kinda preoccupied in a fight (again!) with Mel. Anyways, it's all settled now in my favor (as usual) and ...ooops before I tell you whats' next I have to tell you about what happened earlier than that, remember? =)

Sunday evening, I was feeling, I don't know, kinda "warfreak" (?) like I'm irritated with nothing in particular but just wanted to have a fight with someone. The person I've chosen? Janu. I sent him and sms and asked him if he's still awake but I didn't get any reply. So, I gave him a call instead and half the time he was not talking. It's like I'm wasting his time and just wanted me to hang-up and he prolly tot that by not speaking I'll just hang-up, which I actually did. But, what really got me pissed (and I was already irritated before that) was that when I said ok we'll just talk some other time he just said "bye" then hang-up. Actually, I didn't realized he already hanged-up coz it's not even a proper goodbye (he didn't even say goodnight!) and I didn't here any dial tone or something. So, I kept talking (for a few seconds only though) and realized he's not there anymore. I was so angry at him! I told him "gee, tnx for hanging up" and invented some excuse why I'm behaving in a crazy way. Even if I'm angry, I don't want him to think I'm being crazy for no reason at all. I also don't want him to think that I'm too clingy.  Anyways, just so I can get sympathy from him and make him reply I told him some thing terrible has happened and I just wanna talk. But, when I woke up the next morning, no reply! So, I gave him a call then he was like laughing at me and asking me why I'm being crazy. I guess he already knows me by now. Maybe that's why he didn't reply to any of my msgs. Coz he knows I'm in my crazy mood again.  

Well, the conversation was a very large improvement from the other night coz he's very nice to me. There's one problem though - I lied to him. Remember I told him something terrible has happened? Well, I had to have some stories to tell right? So, I invented this story about my ex-bf coming all the way here and asking me to get back with him. It's nice to know that he wanted me to avoid my ex. Is he jealous? Well, I don't know. But, when we chatted later (ya, he still came online) he asked me if my ex was looking good. Does it matter? Maybe he's feeling a little treathened. I guess guys sometimes need some competition for their girl. It's some sort of an ego boost to them, right? It was such a wonderful though and I remember feeling so light and happy afterwards. He told me about his job and cracked a few jokes with me. He's really so sweet when he's in the right mood. Maybe sometimes he just gets too tired at work.

Later, he came online to chat with me and we chatted about his career and education. I really like it that he tries to get my opinion and considers it when coming up with a decision. I feel so close to him when he does that. It's like he's consulting me for our future together, like married couples do.=) I just wish nothing will go wrong and we'll end up together forever. I just feel so comfortable with him and no matter how much we fight or how crazy I get, he's still there. If it was another guy, I would have been dumped long ago and same with him. Some girl would have dumped him long ago. I guess we're both the same. Maybe he really does love me like I do, he just don't show it in an affectionate way or it's prolly a guy thing. The macho persona always takes control.

As for Melanie, we're ok now (again) and the fight has been resolved. Till the next fight. hehe! She's finally said yes to her boss and she'll prolly start working on her working visa. Good for her. In a way I kinda envy her coz good things seems to happen to her all the time while I'm stuck her. Maybe coz she's too nice to everybody...........I don't know, am I a bad seed? How come something like that don't happen to me? When will my luck strike? She wanted to come but of course I can't do that. She has to be settled there first before I can come and visit her, and prolly work. But for now, I have to work on getting some sort of "specific profession" where I can categorize myself under. Now, that it's finally taking place, I'm feeling like I'm not really ready to make a move. I wonder if I'll ever have the guts to go to Malaysia or Singapore and find a job there or whatever. I'm getting the cold feet. Besides, I don't wanna leave my lolo here so weak and sick. What if God finally decides to take him? I don't wanna be "absent" again when that happens like it did when lola did. I wanna be here for him.=(

Talking to Jan about it today kinda helped me a little. He should be the expert coz he's living there and he's a migrant too. This time he was the one who tried to help me in making career decisions. I'm really glad we're doing this. Helping each other. It's really gonna be unfair if we won't end up together in the end. I'm really scared oft hat happening you know. My heart is gonna be broken to pieces, millions of pieces. I just hope and pray it's never gonna happen. I can envision myself getting old with him, really. I know it's silly but I love him more and more each day.

Anyways, I hope this thing with Mel will work out really great so I can also move there myself when everything's settled with her. I hope she takes care of herself and not do silly things. It's really kinda scary when I think about it. Maybe it's God's way of bringing me closer to Janu. Please, let it be, let it be.

Btw, before I end, I wanna tell you about Ton who's a consultant here in the office. Mharj told me that when I borrowed her charger and Ton asked her if I'm Jane (coz he answered my call and the phone shows Jane L. on the screen) and that isn't it I'm Jessa. Then, Mharj told him I was just using Jane's phone to which he asked what's my surname. So, Mharj started to tease him why he's asking for my surname and he blushed. That was according to Mharj. I was really flattered when she told me that I felt like I'm so pretty and all only to find out yesterday that he kinda "told" them that he has a crush on some stupid OIST girl. Their description was that she's really pretty and rich coz she has a car. I didn't realized that men are also "mahilig sa wheels". It' really made me feel like a loser. I wonder what is it that I am to them? A stupid secretary? I don't wanna think about it really but I have a bruised ego right now. Now, I really wanted to leave this place na!

Thank God for Janu, he can help me feel better eventhough he can be a brat sometimes. But, I love him and he's my shoulder to cry on. I just hope he'll be there as often as I want him to. Too bad, he has to work and whatever it is that he does during his free time.

      I'm so tired I think my brain stopped working. I've been so busy this past couple of days so I missed blogging and now is not the time to catch up. I think my neurons are not anymore working. Anyways, Jan smsed me 2x but I didn't reply, I wasn't able to coz I was too busy. Thank God he missed me! I guess absence makes the heart grow fonder, huh. 

I'm only having 3 hrs of sleep per day and I think I'm feeling the effect already. I literally had red eyes when I came to office! Tomorrow I'm coming voer to work again - to work and to study. I hope I'll finish work as early as possible so I can start with my studying!

Got to go now. I'm dozing off so I have to get home FAST!

      I'm currently having a fight with Mel. Well...what's new? It's getting so tiresome (I've said that already yesterday) so I'm not going to get into detail about that anymore. We're still fighting over the same stupid thing anyway.

So, I told you Jan told me he's gonna call me right? Well, he didn't and what lousy excuse he got. He said something like "the card I was supposed to use got expired blah blha". I mean that's bullshit, right?! Well, later on (he came online before lunch) when we chatted he told me that he lied about it. He said he was just scared that I'm really gonna be angry when I find out the real reason - being that he was too lazy to buy a card. Oh well, that's even worst don't you think? It only shows he's not motivated enough to call me. Anyways, I told him that he doesn't wanna call me, he should just tell me straight "hey stop asking me to call you coz I'm not gonna do it". He said he's not that rude and he can't say something like that to my face. At least he cared - a little.

      Jan didn't call as he promise. Well, he didn't actually promise, but he told me he'll call me when he gets back from work. But, he didn't. Sometimes I think he just think think I'm worth spending money over. Am I being too pessimist? You can't blame me. I just can't think to anything else. If you really love someone, somehow you'll always find the time. 

I have mixed feelings though. A part of me wanted to cry and wallow in self-pity and the other part of me is really angry at time. Then there's a part of me too that is "resigned" like I couldn't care less coz I've already expected this from him. Maybe he just don't love me the way I wanna be loved. It's really funny that the way I'm treating my frined Mel is the way same way Jan is treating me. He also told me once that the way I am to him is the way he is to his Korean ex-gf. I got mad at him when he said that and demanded an explaining. I forgot what he told me but I guess I must have forgiven him, like I did countless number of times.

I had another fight with Mel again and it's really getting tiresome already. What a waste of time and energy! I just can't understand how she can just switch from one bf to another. I guess there's this little part of me inside that is jealous of her. Like how come she gets all the admiration while I get a guy who's totally uninterested in me? And why can't I just dumb this guy?! Why can't I be like her? I mean she just broke up with her bf whom she professed she's inlove with and now she has a new one (after barely a month!). 

Anyways, I'm tired of talking about the same people over and over again. It's gets really boring and pointless. If Jan doesn't love me anymore, then maybe he should just tell me. I've told him thousand times that if shouldn't have any angst about dumping me if he feels like the feeling is gone already. It's better than trying to second-guess everything. Makes me crazy! I mean what's the point of staying together if the feeling's not mutual anymore? It hurts of course coz there's nothing more painful than unrequited love, but what else can you do? You can't bring to life again something that has been dead. You can only nourish those that is "near" death and not the dead.

Whatever, I'm not planning to go to the gym anymore. It's a waste of time and money. I can just do the taebo at home and eat less. As for what's happening at home, my grandpa's weight is deterorating. He doesn't wanna eat anything except junkfoods. You should see him, all he eats are whamoos, shocolate cookies, etc! Then he fights with you if you force him to eat something that he doesn't like, just like a grown-up kid!

Oh well, I think I'd better go now. I don't wanna go home late or else I'll be stuck in traffic and waste more time than I should have! A minute too late always makes a difference really. Wonder where Mharj is. Going home alone nowadays is too depressing!

      Jan didn't come online today. I thought telling him that I won't be coming for 3 dyas would be enough to make him come online. But, I guess he just don't care.=( He said he's already in bed and that he's so tired. Anyways, I'm not gonna make myself get too worked out on that jerk. I have more impt. things to use my energy on. I don't know if it's just wishful thinking but I'm hoping Jan would finally give me a call before the exam. This time, I'm not asking him. Really. I hate being let down. It hurts MORE.

I lied to my boss about going to review classes for 3 days. I just think I had to or else he won't let me go and I really need this 3 days (I was even hoping it's for a week!) to study on my own. I have so much to study about! I'm really feeling guilty about it coz he's being too nice. But, we'll this is one case where I really need to lie. Necessary evil? I don't want to call it that coz it just isn't "evil". I'm making up for it anyway. 3 Saturdays! I hope it's all work it and that lying won't bring me bad luck or something. I just feel guilty. I hate lying...really!

Ok, wish me good luck, will yah.

      I'm going to my boss' residence. I hate going there but I have to be nice to him. He has been nice to me. I really this feeling that I have to repay his kindness and so on... I hope he doesn't try to make a pass at me (again). Anyways, I know I have nothing to lose coz I know I'm not gonna do anything stupid or whatever and I made it perfectly clear to him. He just wanna chat and it's not like we'll be alone anyways. Besides, I had to be nice to him coz I'm gonna be absent for 3 days. =)

      Mel is so irritating! Grrrrrr...it seems like the hotel vacation I've been looking forward to is not gonna happen! We've been planning it for a long time and now she tells me she's not sure she could come! Gosh! It's making my insides rumble! She said she still haven't told her superior that she's leaving during the weekend.

      I'm physically and mentally exhausted! And I mean it literally. I think I really really need a break or else I'll break down. Ok, maybe I'm still far from having a breakdown, but still I think I'm getting there. 

I was hoping that I'll finally get the break that I need when Mel comes coz we're staying at the Peninsula Hotel in Makati almost 4 days (!) and I think that's just heaven coz I'm even considering getting a whole body massage and a spa. The whole pampering thing! Everything seems to be working out well and I mean the planning when boom, she calls me up and starts questioning me about my ex-boyfriend! My God! I was so pissed! I hate the tone of her voice! It's accusatory and yet what really pissed me off to the tip of my hair is that she denies it! She told me she was just asking me and that I was wrong. Ya right, as if I'm a stupid bimbo! When I said 'no, I haven't spoken to him', she said 'really' in a doubtful voice and told me I shouldn't lie or whatever it is. And there's more! When I got angry at her for accusing me she told me 'wag na lang kaya ko punta dyan'. I mean (gritting my teeth at this very moment) is she trying to scare me???! Hello??! Gosh, she's so irritating! I think this going-to-the-US-thing is getting into her head already. She felt as if she's soooo 'special' in a conceited kind of way.

On another "unpleasant" and "irritating" subject, I smsed Jan last night and he didn't reply. Then I smsed him again today and still...the same thing happened. I don't know if I sent him another sms before he finally replied. But he said something like 'I smsed you and you ignored me for 3 days. so I'm going to bed now'. Gosh! What with these people. Can't they be pleasant for a minute or something? Is it just me or what? Of course, I'll ignore his sms! After what he did last Sunday. I mean he knew that exam was very important to me and I really needed to wake up at 3:30 AM and him being in a different time zone will be an assurance for me that I won't oversleep. Well, good news, he didn't wake me up. And what's more irritating is that he called me 2x at around 11:30 AM! GOSH! What did he expect? That I'm still sleeping? It only shows how little he cares for me. He knew it was impt to me and all he could muster was that??? Writing this down kinda made it "real" for me. He just doesn't care about me that much. Hell, he probably doesn't even take me seriously! Anyways, I'm sorry that I got weak again today and smsed him. But now I'm reminded of it again. I shouldn't be the one saying sorry for ignoring his sms. He's the one at fault so he better get his act together and come to his senses.

Btw, he sent me this email last Thursday. I was at home that time studying. Here it is:

 long time no mail from u so i tot ill go ahead and mail u but not a long one.
 
so have u made any new friends? hows ur x? and how abot ur family? is everything alright?
 
sometimes i really miss u and thats when i realize this problem cant be solved with that ease so i just try to forget u. anyways cut the crap. just wanted to tell u i love u. 
 
take care 

Have you noticed that he referred to "ex" again? WHat's with this people and my ex? Gosh! I haven't spoken to that guy for almost 2 yrs and we've broken up like end of 1998! He even told me once (jokingly of course) that he thought I was laready back with my ex since he haven't heard from me for a long time, which I did on purpose. But it has never occured to me he would think that way. I think he has seriously considered that but being the proud person that he is, he'll never admit being jealous or something. Right? Well, what can you say about that? Beats me. It's all so frustrating - this life! Aaaaaaarrrrrgggggghhhhh!

      It's done! I'm done with my LET. I did everything I could to squeeze in what would normally take 4 semesters (or more?) to study into a 3 day studying-period. My eyes hurt! Not just from tireness but I think I got the stupid eye allergy again. I spent like almost 1000 just one medicine! First, I got some visine, then terremycin which cost like 350 (!) then the last resort this patanol eyedrops which i used before which cost 560! Gosh! Anyways, I'm kinda tired now so I'll just blog tomorrow. I have another exam again at 9 am. This time for a regular position here at the Bank. I hope I'll get the job coz it would make me earn something like 20,000 starting! Gosh! I better ace it and not mess it up like I did yesterday. There you go, it's true, I don't really feel very confident about my performance yesterday. I'm still hoping I'll make it though. God help me!

Gotta go!

      The people from the "Bank" still has not given me a schedule on when my interview would be. I kinda getting impatient already. I mean I'm letting all the "prospects" or probably good opportunities pass up. A couple of days ago, someone from PSI Technologies called me and asked me to come for their exam. I had to let that one go coz according to her the interview would immediately follow the exam. I don't mean to sound so sure of myself but I don't wanna be without foresight or something. What if they offer me that "abstract constractor" job then and there? What am I to say? Besides, it's not my habit to take accept a job then leave it as soon as something better comes up. I'm just not the type. I guess it's one of my principles or something. I guess that must be why I'm not getting richer. =) I just hope they call me and interview me so whatever comes out, negative or positive, I can move on to my next course of action.

I had a talk with Jan today. I can't help it, I really missed him. He sound terrible though. All that cough and he sounded like he has a terrible cold. Poor babe. And he still has to drive home in the situtation at 10:30 PM! After a long day's work and classes. I just hope he'll get home safely. I hate to think that what he's doing is really dangerous coz he might go to sleep while driving due to exhaustion. I hope I'll finally get his pic this Monday as promised though. I kinda forced him to do it coz he doesn't want to. He said he just looks terrible. I don't care. I love him no matter what. I really do!

I'm kinda in the mood to go someplace and hang-out today. I hope I'll find someone to hang-out with coz I usually don't have one. My "kababayans" was cooking up sort of get-together though in some place called "Pier 1" in Tomas Morato. I wonder where that is. Never heard of that place. I just hope it's not full of smoke or crowded or too populated or something. I can't stand it. That must be the reason why I don't go to gimicks coz I'd rather stay at home and watch TV. Anyways, it would be nice to see everyone though. I'm just scared for my eyes coz it just gotten "cured" from eye allergies although not totally yet. There are still some signs of itchiness and I'm always afraid it's gonna get worst. So, I'm still thinking whether I should go or not. I don't know if it's worth the risk of triggering my eye allergy!

I hope I'll have a nice weekend and everyone else too!

      I feel so unmotivated to blog lately. I'm having such an awful time...my life sucks nowadays. No sign of Jan nor his pics. He doesn't sms, except couple of days ago. I didn't sms him at all except to reply at his msg. I was thinking that if he can go on with life not smsing me for a month then I guess that's about it. He does not love me. Coz how can it be love if he doesn't miss u at all? Am I making sense here? I'm not really at my best blogging mood so I'm just putting down everything here without thinking about it first or organizing my thoughts. I'm just really depressed. :( If everything with Jan is okay, it seems that other aspects of my life seems to fall into place. I dunno. I'm really sad. :(( I also haven't spoken to Mel for a week. Why should I? After all, didn't she said that will be her last sms and call? She was really acting like a bitch the night my friends and I went out. I mean, didn't she do the same thing when she went out with her stupid friends? Besides, who gave her the right to boss me around? Just because I boss her around doesn't mean she can do the same with me. Anyways, I'm just not in the mood. I hope this week is no indication of how my weekend would fair.

Happy weekend. Jan please call! Show me some signs!!!!

      Just when I'm about to lose all hope, two great things happened this week. Jan showed up 2x online after I told him I'm feeling depressed. On the first day, I was not around coz I went to see the eye specialist. So, he tot I was mad and even sent me two sms and knowing him, that's a lot! Then this second time I asked him to wait and I tot he was gonna leave when I got 10mins late. I guess he does love me still and he did say so. I asked him if he still loves me coz there's no sense trying to work things out if the love isn't there right? To which he told me he still loves me the same way. he just doesn't have the time. He was also kinda hoping I'll give him more time and I asked him if he's just trying to get rid of me. He said no and that he just don't think he can make it next year.  He added something hurtful though before he said he still loves me. He said I should get married. :( Ouch! That hurts that I even burst into tears. If I wasn't in the office during that time,  I would have cried him a river. He's just too tactless sometimes. But, he was nice until last night.

Then athe other thing is that the HR finally called me for the interview! Yipee! At last! I hope I'll be in good condition and very confident by that time. I'm kinda nervous already. I used to have no problem with doing interviews. In fact, I think it's my "specialty" coz I've done two panel interviews in my whole "young" life and both times they loved me. One even told me he really likes me and my sense of humour. I hope I'll do the same this time. Conditioning and confidence is everything! This job is really important to me coz I have the feeling that this is gonna be my "ticket" to see Janu or even to go to other places that I've never been to - abroad! Goodluck to me!!!

      Jan didn't show up today as promised. Well, I dunno what will make him show up online coz I'm kinda getting tired of listening to him tell me he would show up. He even made it sound like he will when I talked to him last Sat or Fri. He said "my Sun and your Monday, right?" As if! I should have known better!

I think this week is turning out to be a bad week for me. I can see the signs already. Not to mention the fact that yesterday I found that that someone "from my house" stole my $100! It could have been Anicia, yet, one can never be so sure in such a case esp when ppl just come and sleepover at our house as "guest". But, I don't think those ppl will ever have the "time" to find my money since I have it hidden so far back in my closet. Oh well, I was kinda disappointed and dismayed coz I just had it changed last month and it's a huge part of my savings.:-( Actually, I was supposed to give her some money since she'll be leaving for home today but I guess it's only understandable that I won't be giving her a single penny. Why she's the primary suspect? Coz we "think" she has done it before and prolly she's getting desperate. Anyways, it will be between her and God now. I'm not really that angry coz I know how unfortunate she is. I can just recover the amount later. Poor girl. If she was the one who stole it, then she's a very good thief coz she never faze at my gaze or my "comments". I told her that sometimes bad karma can be really worse that sometimes it's the ppl you love that you lose in return (I'm trying to find out her reaction though coz I would never wish upon someone such loss. No matter what, money is not worth losing ppl over).

My boss is arriving this pm, so I guess that's gonna be part of the reason for my bad week. She told me to keep my Tuesday free so I guess I know what that means already. I just hope I'll get a call from the Bank for my interview already so I can leave this office ASAP! 

That's supposed to be it, but I failed to mention about the OJ Simpson case. I was surfing about it and looking at Nicole and Goldman's bloody (too bloody in fact!) bodies is so depressing esp when the person who is "obviously" guilty of killing them is decided to be "not guilty". What an unfair and unjust (I know it means the same!) world that we live in. :( It's sooooo depressing.:(( I shouldn't have read it. *scratches my head*

       So hopeless... I'm feeling so hopeless now that I've messed up my interview. I was so disappointed with my performance. I used to be so good at interviews, in trying to "sell" myself but yesterday I was so messed up. There are even times that I had to stammer and try to end my sentence, not to mention that I look like an idiot. I don't have to see my self to know coz I can just feel my eyes going around the room instead of focusing at the interviewer. I just hope they won't think I was making things up. I've never so never in my whole life. Maybe coz I really wanted this job and the stress is just too much to handle. My "reviewing it in my mind" doesn't help either. I kept thinking about their questions and always come up with a better answer than I had yesterday. It really makes me crazy that I would have been "surely" chosen if I relaxed a bit and just told them everything I do here at my job instead of telling them vague "bulky work". I don't know how I can forget all the things that I do here at work. I didn't even mention that I can work under pressure and that I don't panic and have been instrumental in keeping this Organization together. 

Oh well, there's no point crying over spilled milk. But the problem is I don't know where to go from here. I never realized how much I wanted this job until yesterday. Mosre so, I don't even know if I'm gonna pass the LET. The delay in the result is also killing me! Anyways, I hope the HR people would give me another chance and tried to understand my predicament. Besides, 3pm is no way a good time to interview someone. I've been so tired already. Please God, let me be shortlisted. I'll do better in the following interview. I just want my parents to be happy for me. :(

       Interview Jitters  I just had my interview here at the Bank and I don't feel so confident about the result. I've nevr had any difficulty with having interviews, in fact, I think it's my best "qualities". But this time, it was another story. I was so nervous I really think I messed it up. I said some stuff that I shouldn't have said at all like the one about turning down a job and the one about having problems with colleagues.  I don't know what's gonna happen now. I'm so upset and disappointed. I just hope I pass the LET or else I might just have to kill myself like I've said before. I'm no good at anything. But I'm still hoping that God will perform one more miracle for me. Didn't He help me in the first two exams? I guess I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed. =(

      What a weekend! It was my gramps birthday and my uncle, actually my mom's brother-in-law, was showing his "color" too much it makes me wanna puke. I really hate him! I dunno what's wrong with him! It can be jealousy... He's no different from my other uncle who is my mom's brother. He think he's some sort of a "guest" and doesn't even "participate" in taking care of my gramps. Stupid people! I just hate socializing with them!!! I just did it for my gramps sake...poor lolo. :(

Jan was beiing such a jerk again. He keeps on saying "miss you" everytime I say "love u". I dunno what's his problem too. I hope everything gets better before I have my interview.

      I know I know, I've promised you that I would tell you more about passing the LET and all the details, BUT I guess I'm breaking my promise again. *sigh* I'm just too busy and sometimes so not in the mood. What do you call it? A writer's block??? :-)

I have something to tell you that's why I'm blogging again today. First, I'm having my second interview on Thursday. I was so so happy when they called me up yesterday coz I thought I blew my chances when I messed up my interview coople of weeks ago (16 Oct). I hope I'll do better this time andnot get too nervous and mess things up again. This time, it would be the foreign staff (officers) who's gonna interview me. I wonder if they're more hard to please or local staff are more hard to please. No matter what, I'm gonna start studying tonight and do everything possible to relax and ace the interview. 

I've called up Jan at lunch today since I can't bear it that I haven't answered his sms since yesterday afternoon. I told him about the goodnews and he was like laughing that

      I can't believe that the last time I blogged was 2 weeks ago! Yikes! I'm so getting lazy these days to blog coz I'm always so very tired at the end of the day I can't think straight. *sigh*

I read this blog about "Ryan's Head" and good blogs never fail to make me envious. How come they write so good and I write like this?? 

Jan has a new phone, the one with a digital camera, and now I'm dying really DYING to have one too. I can just feel the frustration building up inside me. Grrr.... I wonder if Mel will ever keep her promise. I just found out that the phone that I wanted cost P29,000! Gee! That's a lot of money. I can only afford P20,000 (just barely though). Doods has still not paid me and it's starting to piss me off. Ok, I have been pissed off since the day he tried to lose touch with me! But now I'm really really pissed coz of the way he finds an excuse not to pay me. To make things worst, I really wanted a new phone!!!

My boss volunteered to take me home again and I'm kinda irritated. I'm really really trying hard to be nice to him coz he's old and he's been nice to me although I think it's just one of his selfish acts masked as a good act.  I'm really tired of him! I can't wait to leave this place so I hope I'll get that regular job here at the bank. Tomorrow is my pre-employment medical exam and I hope I'll get the job soon afterwards. I'm so getting impatient!

I'm kinda confused though as to what I really am gonna be. Should I just save (if ever I get this job) and quit after the 3-year fixed term or should I stay with the bank. If not, what about my teaching career and my license? I feel sooo really blessed I offer this all to Him who has given all these to me. He does love me. 

I guess I'll just have to try and do both. That's what I've been planning to do. Prolly volunteer my time on weekends as a teacher while working here on weekdays as well as try to get a masters degree. 

Back to Jan, it's kinda sweet of him to tell me that he'll finally be able to send me photos since he got his new phone with digital camera, but I wonder when he's gonna put it into action coz I still haven't gotten any pic so far. I hope I'll have a new phone too - soon! - so we can send each other photos through sms. That will be so cool!

      I don't actually have a new hairstyle coz I have been wearing th same long shaggy look eversince I can remember...ok, maybe for 2 years...either way it's still new. I had my hair trimmed (I think it was too short but my sister didn't notice any change!) and now two people has already commented that I look different today...blooming. =) First, was Anna. SHe told me I look different and blooming. She actually tot I had hair relaxing. Then, this guy at the bank. While I wash encashing my check he told me they have this new employee (I don't know his point exactly) whom he said he'll introduce to me. Then he said I gained weight but it suits me. SO, maybe it's the hair huh. 

Maybe I just feel lightheaded today coz Janu called me yesterday (finally! I tot after that 58 secs Christmas greeting he'll just forget that he told me he'll call me again) and we talked for almost 20 mins. That's long enough in his standards. He's not so sweet though but that's nothing new with him. It's just the way he is. I told him about the really big fight I had with my sister coz she has been spending too much time with her bf and getting home late. He told me I should spank him and tell her whose the "boss" and I told him I actually did that. I just really did lose my cool. I was actually termbling and crying at the same time. Nways, Jan told me that maybe they're already having sex and after awhile I asked him if he's had sex already to which he said no. I asked him if he was planning to, he said only with someone he can trust. I asked him if he found someone he can trust already and he said yes but he hasn't been with her yet. I guess he meant ME. Who else would be there? If it wasn't me, why else would he say that? Besides, he told me he still likes me but he's just too busy. Reading my past blogs though, I've realized that he ahs always been that way so maybe nothing has change. 

I really do hope we'll end up together and be with each other really soon.  I had a dream the other day about me and mel in New York. It was really cool and I've tot of asking him to come to New York and see me. I can't believehow excited I was, really.

I think I'd like to continue with the dream. Someday, I hope soon, it would be a reality. It would be the happiest day of my life!!!

      I used to blog diligently but now I just lost the drive to do it....even write in my Diary. I haven't changed my Diary for 2 years which means I haven't written at lot lately!!! What made me decide to blog again? It's this other blog "Edge of Reason" whcih is actually the title of the sequel of "Bridget Jones Diary". Both involves writing...blog and diary...and it kinda reminded me how fun it is to write and read your entry when you get older or something.  I guess I missed "documenting" a lot of things.

      I just got off the phone and I really, I mean REALLY, had a great talk with Janu! Very much different from the way we talked after New Year's Day! I guess my prayers were answered! God is great and powerful! Nothing is impossible! Really! 

I was the one who called and I was having second thoughts but I really miss him so I thought what the heck, might as well risk it. If he's a jerk again then he probably doesnt love me anymore. BUt he wasn't! He was so pleasant! I guess he's just not too tired so I called at the right time. Besides, we haven't talked for a while so we have things to talk about! He sounded so tired though. Poor Love. He told me about his dream of being an actor or a band member (a singing guitarist!). He must be kidding but well who knows, right? He told me he got all Cs in his last semester and I tried to tell him that it's not good if u wanted tof ind a good job, but then at contended that ya, at least he passed. That's better than an F. It was really fun and pleasant talking to him. I guess he likes it that I'm in control of myself. Like I'm my own person and not clingy. 

I told him he should get a break or something. Go somewhere and relax coz he sounded so tired. And he told me maybe he should go to "Mineli". I thought he was talking about Liza Minelli. But he was actually talking about our city, Manila. That would really make me happy when he decides to do just that. But, I'm not pressuring him. I'm still happy though that that came out. At least he still wants to come here. Knowing him though I'm not gonna expect too much or else I'll just end up pressuring him. Just expect the worst and hope for the best!

I asked him if he got my card and he said yes and thanked me. I said "it's nice of u to thank me" in a sarcastic way. I think he likes it that I got my old spunk back. I have become so clingy and accommodating that I maybe he started to get turned off. Anyways, he told me his room smelled like my perfume for days and I told him it's only one spray (I lied, it was a lot of sprays, hehe) and asked him if he doesn't like my smell. He said he does and told him I was just following the book to spray on love letters. He told me to throw it away, but he doesn't think my perfume smells bad though. I can just imagine his room smelling like a girls room! =)

I've been praying for nights for us to be "OK" again and my prayer was heard. I always trust Him no matter what. He knows what's best for you. I even remember praying for "someone" to come into my life two years ago, then met Janu the day after. Talk about a gift from heaven!

      I came across this article at hotmail and it was interesting, everything about love is interesting for me nowadays. Anyways, I'm posting this article with my answer so I can refer back to this in the future. Isn't that what a journal is for?=)

"By Maryann Hammers 

Throughout my single life, I've dated countless guys because they were fun, kissed almost as many because they were cute and went on to do more with quite a few because we had great chemistry. And if a guy was not only fun, cute and a turn-on, but also loved my pets, cleaned up after himself and told me I looked beautiful even if I was wearing sweats — well, I usually decided I was in love. 

But it turned out, some of those guys weren't worthy. Why? Because they didn't love me back. Though painfully obvious, it's taken me altogether too long to realize that a guy who doesn't share my deep feelings doesn't deserve them. Now that's my number one requirement. But beyond that essential point, what else makes a man "loveworthy?" 

"Everyone is worthy of being loved — just sometimes by somebody else. Somebody horribly desperate," jokes Carmen, a marketing coordinator in San Diego, Calif. "Some guys are for fun, some are convenient, some are stepping stones, some are huge wastes of time. You just weed through until someone sneaks up and knocks you flat — and you knock them flat too. For me, barfing when he calls is a sure sign that I'm at least on the verge of falling in love." 

How about you? Think you're in love and wondering if he's worthy? We asked frequent daters, women in content relationships, and experts for the top signs that a man is indeed "loveworthy." Before allowing the "L" word to pop into your head or out of your lips, look for these signs:

1. You want to bring him home to meet your parents.
 Uhm, I don't know if I want to coz I know my parents would disapprove of him. But, if we're gonna decide to settle down or something I would bring him to meet my parents even if they disapprove of him. 

2. Things that usually drive you nuts or gross you out suddenly seem trivial. For example, if he's sitting there unabashedly picking his nose, and you don't want to break up with him right there, that's a pretty good sign you're in love. 
 I've seen his latest photo and he doesn't look so good. He may even "not" take baths for a week and I wouldn't care. I would still like him, even if he picks his nose. 

3. He's a great friend. 
 Well, I used to think we're very good friends coz he listens to me whine about everything no matter how silly it is and makes me feel better. But, now we don't talk that much anymore. And when we talked, we seem to have nothing to say to each other. 

4. There's a big grin on your face whenever you think or talk about him. 
 Yes, there is. But, lately it's usually tears on my face and hurt in my heart. 

5. You can count on him. He's consistent, trustworthy and honest. He keeps promises and commitments. 
 I hope so. No, maybe, maybe. No! 

6. He sticks around while you wait for the other shoe to drop. And while you stall, figuring this is too good to be true and are sure that he'll eventually mess up or turn into a troll, he just keeps getting better. 
 He's getting worst. =(  

7. You're covered with hives, sitting in your Aveeno bath, and he asks you in all seriousness to marry him. 
 I don't know. Maybe he'll never ask me to marry him. He told me couple of times he doesn't want to get married. I dunno if he's serious tho. 

8. You've given up your "drama queen" crown. Since you know where you stand with him and are comfortable in the relationship, you don't need it anymore. 
 I'm afraid I'm still a drama queen but I don't think it works with him. 

9. He makes the relationship a priority. 
 No. I don't think he ever did.=( 

10. He doesn't run away if the two of you disagree. Rather, he'll be there to talk about it and work through it. 
 He used to just disappear when we disagree about something, but when I told him not to do it again he didn't. But, don't get the chance to work it through lately. It's always me working it through by myself. Come to think of it, he never did try to sacrifice anything for me. 

11. He holds your hand in public. 
 If we get the chance to meet, I think he will. 

12. Your connection is so strong that you don't even have to ask yourself this question." 
 I don't think there is any connection. But he kinda knows me too well to know how I will react on different occasions.

      How can two words be so powerful? How could it have the power to make my day? Coz it's from Janu and it's from the sms he just sent me. As mentioned yesterday, he asked me to call him today and I did. I did it once...twice..thrice...not successive though..I don't wanna be pushy. Then he picked up and asked me to call after 30mins. So...lunch then called again...but no answer. I smsed him and told him I'll call some other time coz he's atill prolly busy and tired. I'll try not to miss him too much. That's basically what I said. Then...beep..beep... "cal nw". Such two meeaningsless words but it's almost the same as telling me "i love u". I mean, if he doesn't love me or want to talk to me, why would he even bother, right? I told him it costed him and he said yah. He said something about not wanting to disappoint me coz he told me to call...something like that. It was quite pleasant and very satisfying.  Too bad, I didn't have long on my card so I had to go. But still, it's a good thing rather than him telling me again that he has to go. I've got to have some spunk right?

Last but not the least, he still said i love u before hanging-up. That is, without forcing him to.

      I just don't give up, dont I? I dunno what's wrong with me but I gave Janu a call again. At least this time he answered the phone coz it usually takes me like 4 tries before he picks up. Or on a unlucky day, he doesnt pick up at all. It's really hard to decipher that guy which is prolly why I don't give up on him. Maybe I'm after the challenge or something. Whatever it is, I really hope I won't hurt myself too much by doing what I'm doing.

I told him I had to use the card since it's going to expire in a month, which is really true. It's gonna expire on or before 10th Feb and I'm not really planning on calling on him before V-day. I have to make him miss me a little so I'm not gonna talk to him after I use up this card. I just hope I have the strength to do just that! He asked me if I can use it another time like tonight (which I cant coz our phone got disconected) or tomorrow lunch time. So, we settled at tommorow. I just hope he wont do what he did last new year - sleep! Then waking up with a bad mood. Oh boy! That really hurt me that time!

There are really lots of questions running through my mind right now and everyday of my life since he started getting "busy". Does he still love me or he wants to dump me. I mean I gave him lots of opporunities to dump me but he didn't. It doesn't mean though that he still wants to be with me. Maybe he's this kind of guy who can't dump girls, like he cant do it. I don't know. He's pretty tactless and doesn't care what he says so I don't think he can't dump if he wants to. Another things is that, he could have just ignored my call when I call him. I've called him several times and he kept on answering. If he doesn't want to talk, he could just ignore me right? Esp. when we're thousand miles away from each other. 

Anyways, he kept of giving this o=loud sigh and he said he's really tired and I believe him since it's almost 10pm his time and hes been at work since this morning (?). Maybe he's just that type of guy. Whatever it is...I'm not planning at nagging on him anymore. I have to be cool or else he'll think I'm pretty desperate and boring. Men needs to be challeneged too, right?:)

I just hope he'll answer my call tomorrow and not sleep early!

      I had a talk with Jan. He was quite nice but it only lasted for 7mins. Heck, it's expensive and I was the one who called so I should end it immediately. :P

      I have on a new contacts and it's so uncomfy! I can feel the edge of the contacts on my lids. The optometrist told me that this one is thinner than my old one, but I think this one is thicker. And another is that this one is larger in diameter coz it's in excess of my iris which I see in some ppl. My old one is exactly the same size with that of my iris so nobody knows I'm really wearing contacts. I hope the reason why I'm so uncomfy right now is coz it's NEW and it will get better the next few days. Besides, I haven't worn contacts for a couple of months since I had an eye allergy. I hope wearing one now wouldn't trigger another allergy attack.

I have smsed Janu three times and I was hoping he would send me his pick this week. I actually thought I'll get it this morning. I didn't. Nothing from him. Not even a hi or a hello. I've been crying myself to sleep several nights now coz of heartache. I dont know what's going on with him but it's like I have a relationship with myself now and not with him. He's never around. It's used to be he's not "often" around but now it's "never". When was the last time we chatted? I dont remember. The only kind of contact that we have is when I give him a call, which I'm itching to do right now. I'm just stopping myself from doing that coz I know it wouldn't make things better. I've done that and look at me now. No sense calling him again. I don't think he misses me either. Maybe he's so confident with the fact that I still love him no matter what. Sometimes I feel like I'm just some sort of an "alternative" just in case he doesn't find anyone. I mean he knows I'll always be around. I don't know why I'm doing just that. Considering that he never tries to keep intouch with me, it seems like he doesn't exist anymore. I don't know why I just can't let him go.   What a sad life it is. :(

I kept thinking about my ex, Erhiz, lately. I saw someone at the mall who looks like him and I kinda thought about him after that. My sis told me it's a shame that we had to break up and I thought about trying to get intouch with him. But, I didn't get to do that coz what for? It wouldn't work anyway esp. since my parents are very much agaist it since he's supposed to be my distant cousin or something. He has the same lastname with my gandpa and we both have the same set of relatives. So, it's pretty useless to bring our relationship to life.

I just hope I would start with the new job at the other department. Maybe I'll get too busy I wont be able to think about myself  too much. Or maybe I'll meet someone from out there. Who knows? Considering the kind of attention I get from Janu, I doubt if he would even care. I wish he will just tell me how he feels so I can let go. I really hate it that I have to find a man to be happy. They're not the only way!

      I haven't heard from Janu and it's the 7th day from the time we last talked. How can someone "ignore" you that long, esp. if he tells you that he loves you? Is it just the way men are? Maybe not. Whatever it is, I'm not making a move. I have tried to focus on other things, keeping myself busy and meeting friends. I'm actually trying to have a life! If he doesn't come around then maybe he's not the guy for me. It sounds easy but it hurts. But, what can I do? I can't force someone to love me. I'll just have to accept that it's the reality.  C'est la vie!  Maybe someone "better" who will truly sincerely love me to will come around. But, one thing I would absolutely wanna know is WHY. Oh well, it ain't over til its over.:)

I'm actually dying to move to the other department and meet knew people, do new things and work in a new place. I hope I can finish everything at my present work so I can move up there without any "pending" work. I hate having pending work but it seems thats what my boss is actually trying to do! He gave all these "to do" lists and yet he keeps on interrupting me to do something else, adding to my workload! Now, I'm coing to work on Saturdays (for free!) just to finish all those in the list! 

There's one thing about my next job though. The salary I will get is 100+% more than my current salary and I'm happy about it. But, I feel a little guilty about earning so much while the rest of the populace who are working harder than me are just getting less than my current salary, not to mention my sister! I mean she has to work today, on a Saturday, and woke up at 4 AM, commute to work (which is farther than mine) and earn so little. Then her work is absolutely more difficult than mine. I feel like asking her to rent a place near her work and shoulder it myself. I'll prolly do that, if my parents would agree coz they didn't like her living outside our home! Then there's this other guy I saw on the street who's cleaning somebody else's shoes for money that isn't enough for one decent meal! Maybe I should try to get over this guilt. It's not good to get depressed and oh-so-guilty about something I didn't have any control over.

On a lighter note, I definitely need to lose weight (prolly 10 lbs!) and eat less from now on! All my clothes are getting tight and there's not much I can wear anymore without getting some bulges here and there! And I don't want my face to look so round when they finally take my ID picture! All round, all face! lol

      I was too busy to blog yesterday that I missed telling you that I finally got my letter of appointment and I have returned my acceptance form. They actually gave me one whole day to think about it and to read the guidelines (ya right, as if I’ll change my mind! lol). So, my term could have started yesterday and would have started earning more than what I have now, but then my boss have to interfere and delay it. Therefore, my term of appointment would be effective 23 February 2004. Well, late or not, I’m still happy to finally find the light at the end of this hellhole! lol  Ok ok…my boss is nice but sometimes he can be an ***hole! But, let me tell you that he is actually giving a farewell party for me and asked me where I wanted it to be held. Hmmm… I wonder where. *ponder*

I missed telling you too that Jeff finally talked to me and we’re ok now, but he did kinda “confirm” that he’s “in love” with his Aussie friend. I got kinda jealous, but there’s no way I’m gonna give him the satisfaction of knowing that. Friend or not, I still think he’s a jerk. But, I did miss him when we didn’t talk for a couple of days.

 reminiscing Anyway, I have forgotten Janu’s birthday and got a little confused about the dates coz two of my friends’ birthday are also around the same date. So, I referred to our old chat transcript and found out that it’s 24 July. I’m not actually here to talk about his birthday or whatever. I just got a little “melancholic” when I read what was in the old transcript.  Janu “was” such a sweet, “innocent” guy that time. Just thinking how much he’s changed makes me wanna cry. :(

Here’s a portion of the transcript dated 2 January 2002:
 Janu: i am 20 and i love u
Me: i don't think ur parents would allow u to date older grils u know
Janu: i dont think there is anything wrong with that
Me: and besides it might not really be love, just those infatuation thing
Me: u might change ur mind after 5 months
Janu: u dont think i love u do u
Me: maybe
Me: but ur still young and young ppl tend to change their mind very often
Janu: my parents have given me freedom to go out and do what i want
Janu: and i am not like other guys
Janu: i mean not like other teens
Me: but what if they find out ur in love with someone more than 4 years older than u
Janu: i am pretty mature
Janu: i was not acting 
Janu: or anything
Me: oh yes, u r pretty mature
Me: that's why we never argue right?
Me: :D
Janu: it was me 
Me: what do u mean?
Janu: do u think i am too young for u
Janu: oky...
Janu: tell me one thing
Janu: any time during our talk did u feel i am young
Me: of course i did
Me: that's why i was trying to catch u. asking u about school and all those stuff about ur bro and sis
Me: i told u, i'm very observant and if something is not logically right, i can feel that
Janu: i know
Me: u know what?
Janu: that i lied to u
Janu: i hurt u maybe
Me: u did
Me: very much
Me: i don't know why ppl keep on lying to me
Me: what r u afraid of?
Janu: i am not afraid of anything
Janu: u just tell me whats the most impt thing to u
Janu: persons age or love
Me: it's not just choosing between age and love
Me: it's about honesty and love
Janu: then
Janu: if i wouldnt have loved u, y would i tell u the truth now
Janu: tell me
Janu: y do u think i told u the truth now
Me: i don't know
Janu: y
Janu: only bcuz i love u
Me: i don't know
Me: i'll think about it
Janu: its all up to u know
Janu: oky
Janu: i have nothing to say
Janu: its all on u
Me: wait
Me: back
Me: u still there?
Janu: ya
Janu: i am here
Janu: waiting for ur answer
Janu: r u there
Me: im here
Janu: hellllooooo
Me: i still love u u know
Me: but...i hate what u did
Janu: i love u 2
Me: i really hate lying
Janu: i am hating too what i did
Janu: i am really sorry
Janu: but i didnt want u to find out any later
Me: i've always been honest with u telling u everything...my deepest tots and feelings but u still lied
Janu: i didnt lie abot my feelings or thinking about u
Me: and u weren't about to tell me that either if i haven't insisted
Me: that's not what i meant
Janu: my emotions r true as they were
Me: i told u about my wanting to have sex and at the same time being a virgin
Me: all those things and u still lied
Janu: i didnt told u everythin bcuz u insisted
Janu: i just loved u so bad that i didnt wanted to lie anymore 

Reading the transcript is making my heartache for that person really bad. I mean I don’t even recognize that person now. It’s like they’re entirely different ppl. How can someone so sweet can be very cynical and a jerk today? What happened in between? I want that same person back …the person I fell in love with.  Is living in such a hectic, impersonal and stressful environment made him the way he is now? When I talk to him, he sounds so burnt out. Isn’t he too young to be burned out? Is this how the way love works? Does it really fade? I have come to some conclusion that it is actually easier to “fall” in love than to “stay” in love. How do we maintain such love? I did maintain mine, but maybe I didn’t. I may be wrong too in saying that I’m still the same person.  He himself might think that I’ve changed and he wants the old Jazzmine back.  

Oh well, my fingers are getting itchy again. I’m dying to call him! But, I know I won’t. I shouldn’t. To save my pride and to keep him at his toes. There’s no sense being too “available”. If he wants me he’ll call me, right? Now, where did I get that “ur too available” line? I remember Carrie telling Aidan that the reason why she lost interest with Aidan is coz he’s “too available”. It’s too complicated! You don’t want someone who’s too available and yet you get angry when that someone is not always available! Oh brother! 

I dunno what happened to me. I used to be so tough, but now I’ve become like a puppet – a clingy puppet. I hate what I have become. If I was my boyfriend, I’ll grow tired of myself too. So, I should create some distance. Who knows, it might work. Men like the pursuit, the challenge. The more hard to get the women is the more “desirable”.;-) (That’s prolly why he liked me before in the first place and vice versa. He’s also a very “difficult” guy.)  What happens after they get the woman? I don’t even wanna go that far.  Men make me crazy! *sigh*

That’s it for now. I’m having dinner with my colleague at his place tonight and I hope no monkey business will happen! X-( 

Btw, I found this horoscope for both of us (isn't it similar?):
LEO:
Some unexpected phone calls from friends or colleagues could bring you some wonderful news today, dear Leo. A serendipitous lucky break could end the logjam that has held up the attainment of all your hopes and dreams. Love, money, success in your career and personal development - all seem to be falling into place at once. You might spend much of the day walking around in a daze, trying to take it all in. Relax and stay focused. You're on your way!

GEMINI:
Today might be one of the most fortunate days of your life, dear Gemini. Everything you've been striving for - romance, money, creative fulfillment - could all fall into place at various times throughout the day. Expect a lot of exciting phone calls bringing good news. A lover could offer congratulations and other benefits as well! The only downside is that all this stimulation could have you exhausted by the end of the day. Never mind. You'll certainly sleep well!

P. S. Janu! Where are you??? I really miss you badly!!!! A minute, an hour, a day don’t pass by without me thinking of you! :((

      I have just embarassed myself tremendiously. Me and my itchy hands. Don't get me wrong, I didn't steal anything.lol What I did was pm Jeff and told him I missed him and guess what he did? He just ignored me! I don't know why I didn't just stick with my word when I told him I'm not gonna talk to him anymore coz there's no point to talking when he only makes me feel bad...blah blah blah. Then he pmed yesterday and asked me if I was really gonna ignore him, then couple of words blah blah blah. Yet, I still replied and made myself sound kinda dramatic. That's the problem with me, I always wanted to have some punch line or something, always forgetting that not saying anything is the ultimate punchline. Grrr....now he's not talking to me,   in fact, ignored me. I mean didn't he realized I just swallowed a large lump of my pride just to pm him? Don't get me wrong coz I'm not inlove with him. I'm just so used to him being there all the time that I missed him when he's not there. Did I go too far? I always tot he's not gonna foget me or get rid of me, but now...I have my doubts. What to do! :((

      Sometimes I feel like it's better to just alienate oneself from friends, esp. from Mel. What's the point? All we do is fight, we don't even share little "secrets" and what more, we don't have the same interests and personality! Now, she's asking me a favor and expects me to do it right away! Why should I? When I asked her exactly the same favor she's asking right now, she made me wait and wait and wait for what? For nothing! I'm very sharp and direct with her now, to the point of being a bitch, but what the heck? I don't care if she finally gives up on us. I'm just tired!

Someone told me that I'm bitchy. I don't know, maybe I am. Or maybe I just don't wanna waste my time with ppl that I don't like, trying to be diplomatic to everyone, or maybe... I don't know why I do it. Maybe it's a defensive mechanism or maybe there's nothing behind it except that I really am a bitch. 

 Are dreams really your subconscious?  I had this dream couple of nights ago that I was married to someone. We were sitting at the sofa bed and my "hubby" was sooooo in love with me (well, you just know these things in dreams) and then we started kissing. Wow, I really felt the kiss. It was so sweet and slow and full of love. We was the last time I kissed someone? Decemeber 1999! Waaaaaaaaa!=(( Anyways, back to my dream, after a few minutes of kissing, things started to get hot and I told him that maybe we should just continue it in the bedroom. Since, he's my hubby why shouldn't we do it comfortably?lol So, we went to the room and started preparing. I can't remember what preparations we're doing, maybe brushed our teeth or something. Then went to bed, but we both decided that we wanted to go to sleep instead. Then I woke up. Darn! I wanted to finish it! hehe!

I wonder what that means. I can think of two reasons. I prolly wanna be intimate with someone and be loved by someone. Truly loved.  Deeply loved. I don't think I've been loved by someone that way ever. It's all pretty shallow.  I really felt the love in the dream and it felt good, really great. If that's how being deeply loved feels like, I'll prolly marry the guy who will love me more than anything in this world eventhough I don't love him that much (meaning I still have to like him). Well, as long as he doesn't look scary.  Jeff told me the dream means that maybe I wanna get married.  Believe it or not, I actually don't YET!

Anyways, I hope Jan will come around. I'm not calling him again. This time, he has to make the first move, or every move.;)

      The big boss is back! He's supposed to be back on 10th Feb., but I guess he changed his mind. I'm not so sad though coz it will only mean that we can take care of things here before I leave. I mean we haven't even decide on a replacement yet! I have with me two resemes sent by the HR and that's only two of the the "prospects". Knowing my boss, we're gonna need more "prospects". Heck, I was the sixth person to be referred to him before he chose me!

I just hope he wont bother me too much while he's here so I can wrap things up properly before I go. I hate to make my replacement think that I'm not very efficient with my work and that my hard drive is a mess!;)

I had 3 hours of driving lesson yesterday. Oh boy! I wish I can get away from driving. I wonder how much it would cost to hire a driver. *ponder* I never realized how hard it is to drive until I had taken up lessons. The only consolation was that I had a cute instructor.;) Don't get me wrong coz I'm not seriously into him. It's just kinda motivating to drive with someone cute giving u instructions. hehe! I don't feel guilty about it though. I mean Janu is prolly flirting his butt out out there. Give me a break! Men do that all the time!!!;)

Ok, back to my work before I start procrastinating! :)

      I didn't have time to blog yesterday so I'll tell you about it in this entry, sort of a postblog.

One of my (only two girl) friends here at work came over to my office to talk. She told me she's very depressed and she was actually in tears! She didn't give me any details as to what triggered the "depression" and I didn't force her to. I know that in situations like this, the person usually opens up if she wants to and forcing her to talk would be useless. Anyway, she just told me that she's depressed about this career and all and I'm pretty proud of myself that after talking to her she actually laughed! I must be a clown or something. But, it gave a warm feeling to be able to cheer someone up.

      Janu popped up online just to tell me "ilu" and that he "still misses me". It might be short but at least he did something. He didn't reply though when I buzzed him. So, he prolly logged out already coz I came in late after lunch. It made me happy. *grinning from ear to ear* :) I wonder if I should mail him a Valentine card? Hmmm...

 Nways, I'm having moments of sadness during this week but I'm glad I haven't yet broken down in tears. I wanted to eat pizza yesterday but no one is available to eat with me. I hate eating pizza alone coz I can't finish it all up and I'll look pathetic with a large serving of pizza all by myself. :( 

 Last Wednesday at the church, I came close to breaking down. I was so sad, thiking how can Janu ever forget about me? How can someone not miss me? Then my eyes got a little misty but I was able to control myself from breaking down. I haven't cried for a long time now and I'm not going to cry that time. No way coz I know once I start crying, I'll never stop. I love being able to ignore my feelings and control my emotions. I can block it all out and I'm happy that I'm not making myself a slave to my emotion. I don't have the uncontrollable urge to call him or sms him anymore. Sometimes, I have this feeling that I'm getting too hard inside. I'm like this even with friends. When they were not "available" to go with me for pizza, I just left them in the office when it was time to go home. I think I'm becoming bitchy, or am I already?lol 

 I had lunch with the group I have "happy hours" with on Fridays this afternoon. Then, one of girls asked me about something, but this guy replied. He's the "feeling" type. Felling gwapo, feeling funny and he makes Mharj, a fat friend, a butt of his jokes. Anyways, he answered the question for me to which I told him, "Actually, she didn't ask you. She was asking me the question. You prolly should attend one of those good manners and righ conduct courses." Afterwards, he kept on trying to tease me more prolly to find a chance to get even with me.  Well, he didn't get a chance coz I told him he's "asar talo" so he shouldn't tease ppl too much if he can't cope up with the same himself and he shut up. HEHE! I just love the feeling! 

 Tomorrow is Valentines day. I know it's a commercialize thingy but still... I don't wanna say it, but I know what my heart wants.

      I've watched the two-hour premiere last night and it was awesome! I can't wait for the next episode next sunday. Too bad the live telecast is during office hours so I miss it. :(( 

The first one to be voted off was Tina, the winner of Survivor: Outback, and it wasn't a total surprise. (Actually, I can't wait to see what happened so I kinda "looked" at their website. Hehe, kind of looking at the last chapter of a really long novel.) Anyways, it didn't affect me that much coz she's not my fave although it's too bad that it seems like they're gonna vote off the past winners one-by-one. Well, one sad tribal council was when they voted off Rudy. Oh boy, have I cried on that episode. Poor guy. But, Rupert is right, he's one big hero winner or not. 

I'm actually rooting for 3 ppl: Rupert, Rob C. and Ethan (who is past winner, so....).  I really don't like Richard (as always) coz he's really one very obnoxious guy or gay (?), as well as Rob M. who is one masochistic bastard. Didn't he say he and Amber has an "alliance" because of one obvious reason "that she's pretty (?)"! Grrr..... Anyways, the first episode seems to show that this season is gonna be one hell of a ride. I was mistaken into thinking that it's gonna be predictable. It's really fun watching them coz they're all so PARANOID! LOL

       Gosh! My boss just never quits! Grrrrrrrrrrrr!  

 I first worked in this multilateral development bank as a contractual employee and later was absorbed by one organization within the Bank (though not part of the Bank, yet subsidized by the Bank). Quite confusing, huh? Nways, I've worked here for almost three years (trying to buy time until I'm qualified to apply for a regular post.). Finally, I applied last year and got in. The problem was, my boss doesn't want me to leave! He made one hell of a fuss with the HR people trying to stop me from leaving and asking me to get assigned here instead (having a regular post.). But, HR asked me what is it "I" really wanted and I did. So, now I'm a regular at one of the the projects departments. Hooray right?? But no, he doesn't stop there! He asked HR for my replacement and, after 11 applicants, finally succombed to a new girl! Gosh! I thought the interviewing, testing, etc. would never end! I was actually involved in everything! 

 Last week, he asked the HR liaison to let me come here one hour each day to train the new girl (what he had in mind was half day, but I refused!!!!). I thought that's fine, until he gave me the news today. After, my induction on Monday, I would still be assigned here for 5 more days! Gosh!!! I can't believe my new department has agreed to that!!!!!! I mean, they've been waiting for me since DECEMBER!!! They wanted me that much???? That's a loooooooooong wait already! I'm glad they didn't change their mind and replaced me with someone else. Oh well, what can I do...he's got influence. He's actually one of the pioneers of this Bank and a former very senior officer.  

 On another story, the party last night was fun. It was informal and its better than I've expected...unitl my boss asked me to give a speech! Gosh! I hate speaking in public!!!!! Huhuhu!!!!! I had no choice but stammered some incoherent bullshit at the party.LOL I wonder how I looked like? Prolly like a scared deer on the verge of being hit by a car! Hehe! 

 Ok, gotta go!

 On another topic, I got an email from Janu on the 14th and 15th. I tot I wouldn't care, but I guess I still love him. 

 I have a new crush and I think I'm gonna cry. My friend Joan saw him first so he's hands-off for me (as if he's gonna like me!...but still....)!!!!!!!! It sucks!

       I've spoken to my boss' househelp and she told me that she heard I'm leaving this office soon. She's quite nice esp. since she told me that my boss and his wife are so proud of me. Flattery can sometimes get you far.

       I can't believe that the last time I blogged was almost a week ago. I'm that busy?!%@ YES! I'm training my replacement and it's no easy task. It's absolutely DIFFICULT!!! To add to the burden, I hate to admit that we made the wrong choice! I guess this is what we get for being soooo choosy, particularly my boss!  Pili ng pili, napunta sa wala.  I really thought she was "good enough" but I guess she mislead us. I mean, during the interview she looks pretty sharp but unfortunately I found out she kinda slow in trying to "absorb" some things and sometimes she looks lost or phased out. Gosh! I don't know how she can manage here! To make matters worse, I bumped into an HR officer and asked me how the training is going, to which I replied "doing well". I'll just let my boss handle the situation (He's actually dropping hints at the HR ppl!!!). He's good in these things. I really think she has to go coz she won't last with my boss. I'm pretty sure of that. 

 I know it's not good to start my day by complaining. I don't really complain much but this time I can't help it. I asked her to print some emails (in fact, just 3!!!) and it took her about 30+ mins to print the pics!!! Gosh! I'll grow white hairs here!!! Then I have to repeat what I said all the time and I hate repeating myself. Grrrrrrrr.... 

 Nways, on to another topic... I attended this seminar about how to make use of the book "Purpose driven life" and it was fun and enlightening, although I've already known long time ago that we do have a purpose in life. What I don't know just yet is what is my purpose and I hope I'll find out SOON! I just don't want to over-analize things coz I know that, no matter what, in the end He will let me know what's my purpose. I think the most impt thing is that you do the best that you can be and not to take everything for granted. Everything has a reason.I remember the book I once read, "The Celestine Phrophecy", saying that there is no such thing as a "coincidence". When you meet a person, there is a reason why. Life's lessons don't come "carried" by only one person, but a bunch of ppl. (I made this up already. hehe) You get hurt so you can love more deeply next time. True??? Nways, love has always been a risk. There's no such thing as loving someone and not getting hurt. That's not love. It all boils down to whether that person is worth the risk. I used to think that Janu is worth the risk coz he's been there when I needed him.  But now??? I don't know. I don't wanna "over-analize" things, lest I'll go crazy. Sometimes, we just make things too complicated when in fact life is so simple. 

 (Grrrr... my boss is such a pest! He's bothering me again! Ok ok...so I'm supposed to work. But still....he's a pest. hehe!) 

 Ok, back to what I was saying....hmmmm...see! I just lost my momentum! Nways, I met Elinore last night. It's cool to finally meet her. She's a talkative one though. Reminds me of my friend Faye. So perky and full of energy. I'm not complaining though. It's nice to find a friend, esp. for someone who's as unfriendly as myself.:D Hope it's a sign of more friends to come. Maybe one of these days, I'll be as perky as her too and come out of my shell. :) 

 Btw, I just reloaded and my phone and I didn't even itch to call Janu. My pride is greater than the itch this time. Hehehe!!! 

 Ok, back to work.

       I've been so busy lately (well not as busy as I used to be) that I didn't feel like blogging for a while. I'm not just in the mood. 

 I finally transfered to the other department (which I should have done weeks ago if not for my boss) and I like it here. People are so friendly and cool!!! I don't feel like ellaborating much on what happened since then so I'll just copy and paste what I've emailed to Janu. 

  "Nice talking to you this morning. Thanks to me for calling, coz you never call (what a stingy guy!). I actually called for an entirely different purpose as I've mentioned to, but hearing your "sexy" voice made me forgot all my resolve. *wink*  

 What's new with you, besides you getting thinner and thinner each day?? As for me, everything's going fine. My appointment was effective 23rd Feb, altho I only transferred to my designated department this Monday. My division is actually called Governance, Finance and Trade Division, covering the Mekong subregion (I think it's a river bordering Viet Nam, Cambodia, etc.). It's really fun being here. I like all the people around me. They're very nice, absolutely!!! Well, except for the fact that they're trying to set me up with some single guy only on my 3rd day here. I hope it doesn't bother you that I didn't mention you to them. I just don't want them to ask too many questions coz I know exactly what they're gonna tell me. So, I'm trying to spare myself from that. This is actually why I called. I want to let you in on everything coz I have no intention of cheating on you EVER! I always believe in "karma". I was actually surprised when you told me you were planning to date someone, but since you said it's just a joke then I'm glad. Thanks for not planning on cheating on me too.  Coz if you do.....grrrrrr!!!! I just hope you'll send me an email or an sms (or better yet, CALL ME!) once in a while to let me know you're still around and that you're still my boyfriend (or are you???hmmm....). 

 Ok, back to my job. I have 2 superiors - 1 Japanese and 1 Korean/American. They're veeeery nice. Too diff. from my old supervisor! VERY DIFFERENT! They don't pressure me to do anything. Everything I do is on my own initiative from reading the operations procedure to projects administration. It's fun and I'm sitting beside a fun girl, unlike the lazy one I used to sit with. *sigh* I just hope she wont insist on me on dating that doctor coz I don't like doctors. I just didn't tell her coz I don't want her to think I'm so picky and snobby or whatever and create conflict between us.  

 I hope I didn't bore you with my charade. I'm actually very sleepy right now. I got home at 10pm last night from a religious seminar about the book "Purpose Driven Life" where I met with a new friend Elinore. She's fun and very talkative. I mean if you think I'm already talkative, then I don't know what is she. lol She talks nonstop and she has this German "friend" who came over last year and she kept on insisting that they're not in-love when I think they are.  We met online coz she read my online journal (weblog) and dropped me an email. Then she invited me to this seminar. Really lots of pretty girls in one place (including me.lol)!  

 I'm really tired. I don't think I've had a rest since I got my appointment last January. I mean I was working like mad in my old job coz my boss wanted me to finish everything (when my replacement could have done it!!! grrrr...) and train the new girl (who makes me really impatient!!!). So, I've worked every Saturdays since then until last Saturday as well as go back there after my work here at my new job. So, tiring, really!!! But, don't get me wrong....I actually LOVE being busy!!! Except for the "tired" part. Is this how tired you feel sometimes??? 

 I guess that's about it. I have to go back to "studying" the past projects and the manuals. I hope I'll get a reply from you soon (prolly with a pic, again!). Lastly, if you wanna date someone, just tell me. Don't hide it from me. I love you still. REALLY hope to hear from you SOON!  

 Anything new since that email on Thursday, 4 March?? NONE! No sign of him on my voice mail. Not even a missed call on my phone nor a reply tru email. I don't know if I'm just trying to fool myself or what. He just doesn't exert any effort. All he wanted is to "receive"! He even told me in a joke that I should call him once in a while like I just did. Ya right, why doesn't HE do that?? That's what I told him. Anyways, this is going nowhere so I might just give in to my colleague and go out on a date with that guy.x-( 

 On another topic - Mr. C, my ex-crush. Well, I saw him at the cafe downstairs last Friday with a girl, just the two of them. I was with my two guy friends and Mharj and I looked at him not knowing that he was looking right at me. My eyes always gets me into trouble! Nways, I saw him at lunch today and he totally IGNORED me!!!! It was the first time! I guess he's interested with someone else now! SO WHAT! 

 Gosh! I'm soooooooo sleepy!

       I started keeping a journal/diary when I was in college and no one has ever had the chance to read it. NO ONE. The only time that it came close to that was when my ex and I broke up. He thought I don't love him and I don't blame him coz I was never the demonstrative and vocal type. So, I got desperate and brought my diaries (only the ones pertaining to out time together) for him to see for himself that I do love him. But, he was so angry at me he didn't read it.  

 So, why am I talking about this? Coz I gave Janu the link to my online journal. Actually, I started this journal for him. I don't know for what but I have always had the intention of letting him know about tis existence. I trusted him then and I still trust him now. So, I don't mind sharing with him my innermost thoughts. I have nothing to hide and I know he will be openminded about what I would be writing here. If we can't be lovers for good, at least we can be friends (I hope) if it won't work out. I really hope we could end up together though! I love him that much to wanna let him be happy, whoever that source of happiness will be. I just want him to be honest about his feelings and whatever explanations he has I'll just take his word for it. There's no sense worrying over something "unknown" or you have no power over, right? It will only give me more wrinkles and make me uglier.:-) 

 Now, I'm lost in track. I was talking about giving Jan the link to my journal and I have no regrets about it. At least, he took the time to read it twice and left a message. These are simple things that mean a lot to me. I don't wanna be greedy and for something more than what he's willing or able to give. Expecting so much entails bigger disappointment. But still, it would be hypocrite of me to say I don't want more... I just don't wanna beg for love and attention. I want it to be willingly given to me. 

 Speaking of begging, my sister and her boyfriend of 5 years is on the bridge of breaking up. I symphatize with her and I know how much it must hurt. I mean I've never had a relationship that long. The longest "real" relationship that I had is 2 months and online is 3 yrs (?). But, it's really different with them coz they have plans to get married and stuff like that.  I don't know what's the problem but I heard from the grapevine (yes, we actually gossip about each other at home...hehe!) that this guy has gotten so popular with girls and is asking for space. Ya right! I wanna tell my sister "good riddance" but of course I can't do that. She doesn't want me to know about what happened coz she knows I'll get mad at that boy. He told me sis that he needs more space, to what? To flirt?  

 I don't understand this cool off thing. A relationship is supposed to be "two to tango" so if the other one wants out then there's no sense staying together. And men always use this "i need space" crap when what they want is out. Nways, I don't know what's wrong with that guy, but he's really lucky to have my sister. She's sweet, cool and very pretty. Well, not as pretty as myself. Hehe...  ok kiddiing, I honestly think she's prettier than me. Oh well, I don't know what's up with them but I'm not gonna intervene coz I'm in no position to to give advice. Hell, I'm more a mess when it comes to lovelife than them. So, if they want things to work, they better stay away from me.:-)  I just don't want my sister to spend so much money going home to our province and all for nothing. She's putting her heart out to be broken. I just thought that if he needs some space then give it to him and let him come back. Coz even if she goes to him and he doesn't want to talk then he can't force him to talk. Ok, so maybe it's each on her on. I'm prolly just basing my thoughts on my experience with Jan. Who knows he bf is not as rude and stubborn as Janu, right? Oh well, just as Ryan has told me, I shouldn't borrow other ppl's problems. But, I don't want my sister to be hurt and I don't wanna lend her money.;-) 

 Back to my honey... it's been a long time since I called Jan "honey" coz I don't feel like I own his heart anymore. I feel self-conscious like I'm so assuming or something. Nways, he told me to look for other guys again. I don't know why he keeps on saying that. I'm not looking for other guys. I'm just trying to amuse myself during his absence (to no avail!). Is he hoping I would find someone so he can disentagle himself from without hurting me??? Men are so inexplicable! Really! But, I'm not gonna worry myself too much on these things. Again, it's beyond my control. I'll just wait and see. If nothing happens then nothing happens.  

 Something good has happened his weeke though, my former boss didn't give me a single call. That's a relief or I would have ended up yelling at him and be disrespectful. I don't want that to happened coz then I would be no better than him.  

 Last thought... hmmm... I think I'll start doing taebo this April. That's a happy thought, isn't it? :-)

       At last! I got a reaction from Janu! I actually didn't expect that he would reply to my email nor checkout the site that I gave him. More so, leave a comment! It's a pretty simple comment which brings out in me mixed reactions but it's still a reason to for me to rejoice, right? He did used the thrid person addressing thing and actually said that he loves me the same way and that kinda touched my heart I almost burst into tears. I didn't though coz I'm actually sitting beside someone. I also had this really great urge to give him a call but didn't for 3 reasons: 1) I don't have a card and the shop is still close; 2) I don't wanna be overheard by my colleague; and 3) I'm still scared of calling and getting disappointed. He might be tired and in an entirely diff mood from the time he wrote that comment. I don't wanna get a cold treatment very early in the morning! 

 I got a call from my old colleague in my old dept this morning and what she said really made my blood boil. It's my old boss again! That bastard! He just never gives up until he ruins me! I haven't written down what happened last week coz I was too busy. When I got this appointment I've already related that he doesn't wanna give me up and is doing everything to make things hard for me. Well, now he has gotten the HR people involved and it really pisses me off, add to the fact that he tells these lies about my being inefficient, etc. etc. That bastard! I can just imagine pushing him down the stairs! Grrrr...! Nways, my boss and our division head told me that my boss wants me back and asked me if I would oblige him if it's a higher position. I said no, knowing full well how cruel he is. I'm not willing to work another day for a monster! Nways, I went to him and tried to find out the real story since he told me that he just wanted me to drop by and "assist" him/them once in a while and I agreed. But, this time he told me he did want me back and we had an argument. I tried to talk to him nicely but he was really being cruel about it. At one point, he said, "u want to stay there for what? for your selfish reasons?" and I replied "why do you want to keep me? for your selfish reasons too?". I can't believe he'd call me selfish after all the work that I've done and I didn't complain to the HR about his making a pass at me (like kissing my hands and touching my toes!) coz I know I'll ruin myself too if I do that and ppl will speculate and think the worst of me! That stupid bastard! There's no way I'm gonna go back there! Now, the HR officer has spoken to me and I told her what upsetted me coz they told me there's a miscommunication and that they won't transfer me without my agreement. It has been a week and a half since we have last spoken and I'm not planning to call him first! He has to apologize for what he has said! I don't care if I'll never see him again! I'm not scared of him! 

 15 mins more and I'm off. I actually didn't do anything today. Literally! All I did was go to the library and buy some stuff for my table tennis clinique on sat. I'm really looking forward to it. I'll prolly join the bowling club when they start inviting again. So much to look forward to... well, except for this thing called LOVE. I have such a lousy lovelife! Waaaaaaaaaa! Now, they're trying to pair me up with a Bangladesh and American officers. They're just not my type! Nor am I their type! Heh! Now that Jan has told me to look for cute guys, I don't feel like looking anymore. It's just sad to hear him say that. Is he trying to get rid of me? :-(

       Well, it's true... a little. Eversince Janu started "ignoring" me, my eyes have been on the lookout. It's not as if I'm hounding people and oggling at guys that come my way. No, not in that sense. I only meant that I used to not notice anybody or any "men" eversince we started our little "love affair". But, now I'm starting to notice cute guys here and there again. I just thought well what can I do, there's no sense rooting for him when he obviously doesn't remember me nor miss me. :-( Might as well have fun while I'm being ignored. It hurts but I don't wanna dwell on the pain. I'd rather focus my attention on diff matters.   

 There's not a day in my life that I don't think about him. I have this urge to call him just to say hi but I can't make myself do it. I've done it many times, but it doesn't make him call me, or sms or email me in return. It's like nothing has happened. So, it scares me to call him. If I call, it would be like trying to hurt myself on my own. So, by not calling him, I'm avoiding getting hurt. Ok, so it hurts now, but it would hurt more if I give him a call. Maybe I should also do the fading thing. But, how can I fade from someone that I love??? 

 I don't wanna dwell on that coz it makes me wanna cry and get deppressed. I wanna make my day happy, as much as possible. And I make my days light by keeping myself occupied and "flirting". Ok, it's not actually flirting coz I don't think I can do that. Contrary to what I tell people, I'm actually too shy to flirt. Nways, I wanna talk to you about my old crush at work - Conrad. I used to have a crush on him like 1-2 yrs ago and got turned off when he actually gave me a call. We used to bump into each other at the hall and even told me once that I have a beautiful smile. Hehe! What can you say to that? I actually replied "ganon". Such a lame reply. Then we sometimes have eye contacts (I think he does that on purpose!) at the cafe and smile at each other when we do. It's really one of those teenybopper corny things. Pretty stupid. Nways, I'm not telling you this to talk to you about an old infatuation but to tell you that I think I have a crush on him again. I don't know, but he kinda makes me nervous everytime I see him. I accidentally went to their room last friday and I felt like I was gonna die of embarassment right there. Add to the fact that the guy who's been emailing me was there too and they were looking at me like vultures (ok, I'm exaggerating...but it really felt that way!). Then they pointed to me the right direction, but later he came to the same room and tried to rearrange his chair or something. I mean who rearranges a chair?! What lousy excuse. LOL Then he asked me if I'm still at the second floor and I answered "no, I'm at the 6th flr" with a blank stare. Gosh! I don't know what's gonna happened to me but seeing them all around me made me nervous and made me tongue-tied. Jhocep even tried to shake my hands to congratulate me or something but I refused coz my hands are so cold. Waaaaaa! That was Friday. Then today at breakfast, this guy from their dept. sat beside me at the same (long) table when there are other empty tables around. I can't eat well coz he sometimes glance at my direction. Then things got worst (or better?) when Conrad sat infront of him which is diagonal from where I was sitting. Oh boy! Did I have a hard time swallowing!!! Then he borrowed the salt from me (a smile here and there) and then I got up (a smile here and there again) and that's it! I was kinda hoping that other guy would have left ahead of Conrad but he stayed there even after his meal. Ok, I was kinda hoping something like that would happen and my friends told me to look at him straight and smile...in other words FLIRT! But, I can't look! I was a nervous wreck!  

 There must be something wrong with me. I have to loosen and not get too shy around people, esp. men! I was at the elevator once with this cute Italian or something guy and he was looking at me (coz I can see from the reflection) until he was actually facing me and yet I kept on looking at the front. I dind't even acknowledge he was there eventhough we work in the same Bank. Can you believe that?!! I'm so lousy! 

 Ok, I feel a little better now. The topic of crushes and cute guys seems to lighten my mood (eventhough it's temporary) coz after a while I'll get deppressed again and get reminded that Jan's ignoring me. At least it makes me feel like there's other guys out there besides Janu and life after him. Ohhh, why is it that the one you want more doesn't want you back. Too many guys around and yet I don't want any of them! Waaaaa.... But, I'm still hoping that it won't come to that. I still love him. SO MUCH IT HURTS. Corny but true. :-(

       I feel a little down this morning. It must be the weather or something. OR, it can be this...  "Now that I'd made the decision to break up with Morgan, I needed to figure out exactly how and when to pull the plug. I am a terrible breaker-upper -- only committing the act two or three times in my life. I prefer the more tried-and-true method of letting the woman do the dirty work for me. Or, even better, The Fade. That's when you just gradually fade from her life. Suddenly, you stop calling all the time, or you stop being available to go out with her. One day you're part of her life; the next day you're but a fuzzy memory. It's a horrible way to break someone's heart, but it sure beats having The Talk. That is something I'm just not ready for yet."  

 I got this from Zach's diary "Diary of He". It's a fictional diary but sometimes it makes much sense out of men's behavior. It kind of wakes me up from my deep slumber or my blindness. I get blinded by love and I make excuses for everything. Just as I have been making up excuses for Jan's inability to come online for me or even to call or email me. Nothing. No sign of him anywhere for weeks (or months? I can't tell). I have been very successful in ignoring his absence coz I'm busy myself. I dunno what's different about this morning but I felt kinda depressed by the realization that if I don't make a move to get in touch with him for weeks, months, years, ever...I don't think he's gonna do anything on his own. Thus, this para by Zach really struck me. Is he using the "fading technique"? Is it common among men??? It really depresses the hell out of me. :-(

       I've been in the office since 4:45 AM. I guess I overestimated the time. Nways, better early than late esp. since I still have to put on my contacts and all. Btw, I'm not here to work lest you misinterpret my "earliness". We're actually going on our dept. outing at  urlLink The Farm . It's in Batangas, 2 hours from here and we're supposed to meet here. I'm not as excited as I'm supposed to be though coz I'd rather be at the beach. But still, I'm not missing the body scrub "Oriental Journey" esp. since it's paid by our comp. No way. :-) 

 P. S. I miss jan.

       What an intense morning!!! Whooo! I need some air!!! And it’s only the first half of the day. It’s actually for two reasons: Jan’s comment and the guy I was talking about in my last blog. 

 When I got to work this morning, I didn’t immediately chick out my blog coz I know Janu won’t be giving any comment. Well, not after 5 days (?…I lost count) of silence from. I actually had a feeling that I might have written something offensive or that he took the “big nose” thing seriously. Well, my intuition was right. He did and he told me so. First, I’m glad that he told me that I was offensive. For all it’s worth, I really really appreciate honesty. Second, I am truly sorry for offending him. I never meant to be offensive. I have always been spontaneous in my blog. I never edit it. So, what you see is what you get. I just felt that my journal is the only place wherein I can truly be honest about something. I just hope he forgives me (again). I really have a knack for offending him. I remember the first time he sent me his pic where I said some really stupid and hurtful things about how he looks. Me and my BIG mouth! I don’t want to make excuses; I’d rather admit my mistakes. So, I’m truly sorry for the comment. I never meant to put someone down. I’m so ashamed of myself.  

 The other intense thing that happened was  urlLink about this ,  urlLink this  and  urlLink this . I can’t believe what's on the news! I was only talking about him a few days ago (he’s the other nose-y guy that I have a crush on). I’ve known that he’s divorced, that he has a small kid, and that he’s always “visiting” our external counselor but I never thought that his problem is this HUGE! Poor guy! That must be why he was staring at my shoes. He was actually deep in thought about his problems! Now, he’s on the brink of losing his children, his livelihood and his life (God forbid!) too! How can a person (his wife) be cruel to someone whom you were married and prolly loved before? It must be the drugs. (I remember my ex getting really cruel on me when he was “suspectedly” on drugs.) Nways, I hope he does well coz he and his kids deserve to be together. I hope that the children’s rights activists and groups and the Philippine government would help him out on this. May God bless him! 

 Back to Jan, I hope he’ll accept my apologies. Some people say stupid things, really. :(

       This morning was quite out of the ordinary. I have a crush on this Swiss guy, well not so serious coz he's a divorcee and that's a big NO NO for me, and we were on the same elevator this morning. Man! I can't breathe! It's actually me and my colleague who has a crush on him and he always catch us staring, so I was really nervous about being with him the elevator. I was almost hyperventilating! He was looking at me like he's telling me "let's see if you can still stare at me now that ur not with ur buddy". It was the longest elevator ride of my life! We got off at the same floor although he's in a different wing (I made a research on that...hehe!). He also looked at my shoes and I felt like "darn! my shoes must be dirty!". He's not really that good looking. In fact, he has a big nose. Hmm....what is it about me and big noses (sorry Jan). :-)  Speaking of Janu, he didn't leave a comment this time (waaaaa....sob...sob...). Of course, I didn't expect him to read my blog everyday. Hell no! If I do that he'll die of boredom.LOL So, I'm not really crying over this. Those 3 days that he read it almost feels like breaking record. ;-) 

 Obviously, it's still not so busy here at work coz how else would I have time for this?:-) Well, I'm not complaining. Today, I've decided to be productive and work on my feasibility study. Who knows, ADEZ might still accept it and give me my MBA degree. I know there's no one to blame but myself coz I've procrastinated too long. I just hope it's not too late. 

 I've been talking with my sister last night and she's pretty decisive to go to Z.C. Maybe there's still trouble in paradise, contrary to what she told us last Saturday. She said the problem is solved and besides, her bf doesn't want to break up. He just need some time. Maybe the boy is getting pressured to marry her since they've been steady for 5+ years! I guess they won't just throw the relationship away just like that, right? Nways, I've made some reservations for her and I hope she's not expecting me to pay for it coz I still have a $500 phone bill to pay (and that's just the first of a series of payment! Hola!). I can just feel the weight of that bill on my neck. So much for my dream phone, the Nokia 6600! Grrrrrrrr......!

       First day of the week... I wonder how this week would turn out. I hope I'll end up doing something besides surfing, shopping and what else. I'm actually running out of ideas to amuse myself. My department is usually seasonally busy. So, it depends if there's a project going on or nearing its deadline. When it's busy, it really gets busy up to the neck. But, the projects are just beginning so there's nothing else yet to do. 

 Last Friday, when I said that the cruel monster (my old boss...hehe) didn't bother me the whole week I was wrong. At my last hour in the office, one of his two assistants (yes, two girls are actually doing my job!) called to tell me that they can't find something and that it's urgent. Truth is, there is nothing urgent in that office. I have the feeling that the monster just wanted me to go there while he's still in the office. Well, there's no way I was gonna go and see him! For what? For him to insult me and ruin my day??? No way! So, I just opted to go there as silently as I could and look for the soft copy of the file instead, then left as silently as I had come in. He didn't know I was there coz he was in his room talking (arguing!) with that crazy German. Then, as soon as I got back to my dept. his asst. called me to tell me that he said "thank you". So, he's trying to be nice to me now?? Ya right. As if! *rolls my eyes* I've been with him for 3 yrs to know that he's a double-edge bastard. He will be nice to you up front but attacks you behind your back. He keeps on asking the two girls if I've been cooperative and willing (so and so) to help, etc. and I know why he's asking them that. He's trying to look for some loopholes wherein he could complain to the HR ppl about me since they've requested me to assist them when they need my help. He's really such a pest and I dunno when this will go on since noone is indispensable as he told me once! Nways, once I've established the fact that I don't like someone, I'll never like him again ever. That's the way I am. 

 Nways, my weekend was not as what I have expected. I didn't turn up at the table tennis clinique coz I don't have a partner yet. The only person I know whom I've seen on the email sent to us was Brian and I don't wanna pair up with him. So, I just stayed home and watched TV. It was soooooooooooooo hot! A scorching 34C!!! And I didn't turn on the airconditioning coz I found out that our electric bill has turned double! I don't know why but I'm gonna find out. I don't trust household helps now eversince that telephone episode. So, I told this new girl to lessen her TV watching coz she watches TV the whole day and what else I don't know.  That night, yy sisters (and my sis' bf), Mel and I went to the Board Walk along Roxas Blvd and there were lots of ppl. It used to be neglected coz of the smelly Manila Bay. But, the tourism secretary, Richard Gordon, turned it around and now lots of ppl go there again. It was pretty impressive how he did that. I mean he made Intramuros interesting again! Then, on Sunday, I visited my sister's apartment. I've been meaning to do that since she moved to that place coz my mom wanted me to look for "shady" ppl or anything not so good in the surroundings. In other words, my mom wants my stamp of approval on that place. :-) It was quite nice and homey and we had some fun and lots of eating with an old friend from way back, Betcha (my sis' bestfriend). 

 Robin smsed me again. I don't know what his problem is but he comes out to me as a bit pretentious. He pretends to be my friend but I have a feeling that he just wanted me to regret dumping him. He courted me before and asked me to "move our friendship to the next level". I said no coz he's too boring and nice for my taste, but I didn't tell him that. I just told him that I'm not intereted in having a boyfriend right now. Now, he's telling me he has a gf and they've got plans etc etc. that she's a nurse and they're migrating etc. Then he told me that my MBA units are not gonna be credited unless I take a refresher course. He actually told me to go back there in Zambo and get a part-time job. As if, that's the only MBA school here in the Phils.! I've actually talked to one of the professors and he told me I can appeal to the Committee or something and being the friend that Robin is, he tried to discourage me and told me that his sister had the same situation blah blah. So, I don't think he is really being a friend but a devil's advocate. He wants to brag about all the good things that been happening to him and his girl and discourages me on anything on the other hand. It's really funny coz the truth is, I think he's just sourgraping and I don't even care what these good things are. I'm not even bothered in the least bit. I never had any feelings for him. I don't feel mad at him. I just think he's pretentious. Poor Robin. He's really such a nice guy, just not my type. 

 To end on a happy note (I was actually saving best for last), I was really excited this morning to check out if Janu left any msg for me in my blog. He did! At first, I tried to tell myself to just be calm and not expect anything and I did. It's really nice of him to leave such a sweet note. I doubt if the lazy boy actually reads everything in my blog...LOL! Kidding.... (Jan, thanks for visiting my blog. ILU). It's really such a wonder how such simple things can leave you full and happy to last you for the day. Is "love is a many splendored thing" true then? Maybe. I'm in love again! :-)) 

 P. S. Sukanda just gave me a bag from her mission in Viet Nam. What a sweet lady!

       ...when I feel that there's nothing going for me. I just finished accounting my personal and household expenses and there's like Php 3,000 unaccounted for. I hate it when this happen!  

 It's a lazy Wednesday morning and I really wanna go home and get some more sleep. We're prolly the only ones in the whole city who has gone to work! It's a declared holiday so we're not included (we only observe legal holidays!). Maybe I should just go to our clinic and pretend to be sick so I can sleep in one their soft, oh-so-sleep-conducive beds! Nways, since it's not such a hectic day coz everyone seems to be away, I can't stop but think about food! I have my fave chocolate bar on my drawer and I'm so contolling myself from diving into the heavenly creamy texture of the choco. I haven't done it so far, so I guess I must have a big self-control, huh. ;-) (I should stop thinking about it!!!) 

 Talking about can't stop thinking... I can't stop myself from asking why Jan has not left any signs yet. Did he really made up his mind about the "go after the swiss guy i don't care" comment? Did he really mean it in a final way? I can't believe he would be too sensitive about that comment. I mean he can be rude to me and I can't return the favor? Who am I kidding?! Maybe I should stop this stupid illusions that he does love me still. AM I just trying to fool myself? When was the last time he did anything sweet for me? The little comments he left is sweet but I need to hear his voice too. I can't keep on calling him. Love is supposed to be two-to-tango. What kind of a dance is this if I'm the only one figuratively swaying my hips. Dancing with a passive partner has never been known to work. If he doesn't care (just as he told me) then I guess my hands are tied. I really don't know what to do anymore. I was sorry for what I did, but I don't think I deserve the cold treatment. Oh well, what's new? He has always given me the cold treament for a long time. Maybe it's his way of getting rid of me. I'm just too stupid to realize that. Gosh! It really hurts! I better get back to ignoring his existence and not hurt myself more! My lovelife sucks!!!!!!!!!! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       For lack of title, I just decided to call this day a not so holy Monday mainly because it is already the beginning of the holy week and yet I'm not doing anything "holy" at all. No prayers, no meditation, no nothing. Nways, let me tell you first about my weekend. 

   Saturday at The Farm  
My day at the farm was not as fun as it would have been if I have spent it on the beach. Our bus left the office grounds at 6:30 AM and we arrived there at 8:30 AM, a very long trip. I've been dying to go to the restroom within the 1 1/2 hour of that 2-hr trip and oh boy was it torture! The Resort was quite a place with lots of trees, weird flowers, a lake and tons of fresh air like no other. In short, it was a very serene and peaceful place. The food was not so exciting though coz all they have in their restaurant are vegetarian foods, or prolly vegan coz they don?t serve dairy products.  

 When we got there, we had a little tour of the place and then Ellen and I went directly to the restaurant to get some late breakfast! We're starving! We didn't even notice that we're eating vegetarian foods and we're both carnivorous! LOL After that, we went for a swim. I was not supposed to go for a swim coz I don?t wanna get into a swimsuit (we're not allowed to wear short shorts!) but the water was so inviting! I mean the pool was overlooking some sort of a terrain with the mountain and it was 34C! So, I can't help but go for a dive! Well, not until after I put on tons of sunblock. Hehe :-) 

 Then another vegetarian buffet lunch... Then the body scrub and the massage. It was such an experience! I mean taking a bath butt naked in an open bathroom (although noone can see you from the top of the mountain)! I felt very self-conscious I took a bath with a sarong! Well, you can never tell, right? The scrub was heavenly I want it to last forever, but the Thai massage was agony I thought it lasted forever! Gosh! I think I can still feel my back in pain! Too much stretching! I guess it only shows I lack exercise.  

 It was uneventful until I met someone I knew from my childhood. I was surprised to learn that she was working there. I mean what type of work would she be doing in a place that gives massages? Of course, she's a masseuse! It was quite a shock though knowing that she's a licensed physical therapist! I mean 5 years of college only to end up in the crappy job! It really is a pity and I know she was embarrassed that I saw her there so I didn't tell anybody that I saw her there, well except for my sisters and mom.  That's how hard it is to find a job here in my "beloved" country! 

   Sunday's The Passion  
My sister and I went to see the talked about movie "The Passion", finally! It was so disturbing in a way that I didn't feel happy about watching it and yet I didn't feel sad. I cried through most of the movie though not coz of the visual but coz of guilt. It is my religion's (Catholic) belief that Jesus died to save us from our sins and during those times what I was watching I really felt unworthy of his sacrifice. I was asking myself if I was ever worth dying for and worth going through all those sufferings for considering that I've never been a good Catholic. It's like all those sufferings for nothing. For goodness sakes, I haven't even read the Bible (in whole) once! While Jan read their Qur'an 3-5 times! That makes him a better Muslim than I am a better Catholic! I hope I can do something this coming holy week! 

   forgiveness  
I haven't "heard" from Jan since the last time he told me that he was hurt by my "big nose" comment. I apologized for it but I guess I'm not forgiven (?). Have you ever had a hard time forgiving someone? I did. With my former boss. To date, he has already apologized twice and yet I can't bring myself to be nice to him again nor forgive him. I never thought that it could be this difficult. I never held any grudges against anyone else for long but this time I just can?t help myself.  It's just that when he said "sorry" I just can feel the insincerity in it. I don't feel that he's sorry. I just feel that he's saying it so we can get back to "normal". So, I just say yes to shut him up but truth is I still hate him. He can apologize all he wants but I've seen his bad side and I don't feel like befriending him again. What's the point? I told him that too but to avoid further arguments I just say ok. No matter what he does, he san never change the fact that he said a lot of mean things. He has no right to say those to me! Besides, I don't feel like exposing myself to "harassments" in the future! 

 Going back to Janu, is the unforgiving state that he feels for me the same as that I feel for my former boss? If that's the case, then I don't think I'll ever hear from him anytime soon, or maybe never. Does he also think that there's no point in communicating still? I hope not. It hurts but it's a possibility. :-(

      What is love? I can't tell exactly what it is but I know that it is important to our (at least mine) existence. I've never been so good in relationships as much as my sisters, cousins, friends have been and I don't think I'll ever be. There's something about me that says it's not for everyone else, e.i. not for me. I don't wanna be pessimistic but there is nothing optimistic in my life right now. This brings me back to my counting what I don't have and not what I have. I'm quite confused, really. The only thing I know for sure is that I'm not happy, ergo, I'm LONELY!

      So much for expecting an email! All I got was "thanks". Well, I'll try to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he did mean "thanks for replying (I'll get back to you with a real response)". I just hope he'll tell me what he thinks about what I said... "Thanks" doesn't actually explain what he meant. Oh well, only shows how lazy he is... or just don't give a damn(?)... I don't even wanna get into that territory!

       My heart is breaking into pieces...A friend emailed this to me... I don't know why.... 

  you don't have to forget someone you used to and still love. what you need to learn is how to accept the verdict of reality without being bitter or sorry for yourself. believe me, you would be better off giving that dedication and love to someone more deserving. don't let your heart run your life. be sensible, and let your
mind speak for itself. learn to listen not only to your feelings, but to reason as well. 

 always remember that if you lose someone today, it only means that someone better is coming tomorrow. if you lose love that doesn't mean that you failed in love. cry if you have to but, just make sure the tears wash away the hurt and the bitterness that the past left you. let go of yesterday and love will surely find its way back to you. and when it does, pray that it may be the love that will stay and last not only 
for a lifetime, but forever. 

 "when i lost you, i was the one who loved you most. but between us, you lost more...for someday i can love someone the way that i loved you, but you will never be loved again the way that i did...."  

 All I know is I feel this way... 

  If you leave me now
You take the biggest part of me
Ooh no, baby please don't go  

 And if you leave me now
You take away the very heart of me
Oh no baby please don't go
Oh I just want you to stay 

 A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes and we both regret
The things we said today

       I have to say that this is absolutely a good day for me (well, if I don't consider the "silent treatment" that Janu is giving me). Nways, back to my day, it's a typical busy day for me but today it's quite different for me - it is absolutely fulfilling. I got an "excellent" and "I'm impressed" praises from two of my supervisors today. That's a wow for me. I mean, it's not everyday that those people give you such lavish praises. I must be really good (grinning from ear to ear). 

 The only rotten thing for this day is the P10,000 outlay that I had to do for the damn telephone bill (still aprt of the P50,000 that I had to pay)! It's like saving for nothing. That money could have bought me a roundtrip ticket to somewhere, maybe Australia or the USA (plus a little more)! Nways, no sense crying over spilled milk. No need to dampen my "excellent" and "impresive" day. 

 I hope tomorrow will be the same, if not much better! Yippee yay yo!

       I Just close my eyes and I'm with you  
And all that I so want to give you  
It's only a heartbeat away   

 When I need love  
I hold out my hands and I touch love  
I never knew there was so much love  
Keeping me warm night and day   

 Miles and miles of empty space in between us  
A telephone can't take the place of your smile  
But you know I won't be traveling forever  
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do   

 ....I really miss someone!

       Physically and mentally! It's more like my eyes have been really strained these past few days, or maybe I just feel that way coz I'm still adjusting to my new monitor. The Bank has finally replaced my pc - a cool HP Compaq 1530! I can't wait to use the DVD and CD-W (at work? ya right!). The problem is that the very sharp colors of the flatscreen (even after some adjusting!) feels strenous to the eyes. I don't really know if this "less radiation blah blah" is true. It's prolly just an advertising hype! 

 Socialization-wise, I've met a new friend and "lost" her again - she went back to the US. She's Mel's cousin Tessa. She's 32, single and veeeeeeery cool (like me! hehe!). It's really cool coz we've only been together for like couple of hours and now we can't stop talking about each other. It's like finding a soulmate. I actually have one - Inese - but maybe we can have lots of soulmates. Or maybe we're just so similar we think we're soulmates. I don't even think there's such a thing as "soulmates" but I'm using it as an "adjective" to describe how much we got along with each other. I mean everytime she talks it's like it's me who's saying it coz I can imagine myself saying the same thing. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing her again this November. It'll be a blast!  

 Work-wise, hmmm... well, I made some blunder yesterday. Waaaa... well, it's not really my fault that everything got delayed. I mean I've done everything that's "within" my power and there are things that are not in my control. Last Monday was our national election so the local staff were excused from work and when I came here everything was a mess (delayed). He almost didn't get his travel money! I mean I had to "negotiate" with the Bank (at 5:30 PM! 1 1/2 hrs past closing!) to let him get his travellers cheque! I tot they were gonna say no but then I was really desperate so I just closed my eyes and asked God to please let them say yes and they did!!! Oh my what a relief!!!! So, it wasn't really 100% blunder but almost... Still, I expect too much from myself and I don't want anything like that to happen again!!! Ever!!! I hate not being efficient (even if it's not my fault!! Oh well, that's part of the reason why I had a migraine last night... 

 Lastly... hmmm.. I haven't heard from iceberg and I don't know if I'll ever hear from him. Makes me wonder what he meant by talk to you "soon...I don't know when that is..". I'm kinda wondering whether it means he'll just get in touch with me when it's time for us to meet (?). I keep thinking thinking thinking and thinking about him, but there are times when shutting him out of my mind don't seem to work. I really hate it. It's like inflicting pain on myself. Sometimes thinking about my "lovelife" really makes me feel like a loser. :-(

       I found this article at our daily online news, usually emailed to us or published in the intranet, giving us links on news bits that might be of interest to the staff. One of the articles is very interesting indeed... in a sad way. 

   Philippines, South Korea: study in contrast  
 May 19, 2004 

 Agence France-Presse 

 JEJU, South Korea -- The riches-to-rags story of the Philippines in contrast to South Korea's march to First World status underscores the importance of the right economic policies and their implementation, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Monday.  

 When the Manila-headquartered bank was established in 1966, the Philippines was second only to Japan as Asia's richest nation, while South Korea was among the top borrowers.  

 Nearly four decades later, their fortunes are completely reversed -- the Philippines is one of Asia's poorest countries and South Korea is now a key contributor to the bank.  

 ADB president Tadao Chino said the two countries provided a study in contrast in the bank's overarching goal to significantly reduce poverty by 2015.  

 The number of people living on less than a dollar a day in Asia has generally fallen, leading to a better quality of life and longer life expectancies, Chino said at a news conference at the close of the ADB's annual meeting in this South Korean resort island.  

 However, there are differences among countries and how they formulate and implement policies and multilateral aid.  

 "Not all the countries develop at the same rate and that depends upon the various given conditions [and] environment for development, and also the effectiveness of the policies and their implementation," he said.  

 Chino said the Philippines economy has improved and is projected to grow between 4.5 and 5.5 percent this year and next, compared to 4.5 percent in 2003.  

 "It is not bad but more can be expected," he said.  

 Chino said there were "complex factors" that inhibit the inflow of foreign investment as the country is burdened by a huge budget deficit, low levels of public spending and a lack of investment in infrastructure.  

 Financing the deficit keeps interest rates relatively high which in turn keep investors at bay, he said, adding that the Philippines' rapid population growth was also an impediment to growth.  

 "If there will be major political and economic reforms, then I think we can expect much higher growth rates ... It will improve the lives of the people.  

 "But that all depends upon the government and the people -- how do they make the effort for a better economy. The most important is to improve the environment for private sector activities."  

 Other analysts outside the ADB have cited rampant corruption as a deterrent to investment in the Philippines.  

 On the other hand, Chino held up South Korea as a model of poor countries that had received ADB aid and are repaying them now by becoming donors.  

 South Korea put out the red carpet for the more than 3,200 meeting delegates who held meetings at a posh, glass-walled international convention center that offers a sweeping view of the ocean here.  

 Seoul contributed 113 million dollars to the latest replenishment of the ADB's anti-poverty fund, which totaled seven billion dollars to be disbursed between 2005 and 2008.  

 "The Korean government has been contemplating ways to return the valued favors we received through the ADB to fellow member countries in need of assistance," South Korean Prime Minister Goh Kun said when he opened the meeting on Saturday.  

 He said South Korea will establish an "e-Asia fund" to help poor countries in the region improve their competence levels in information and communication technology.

 Pathetic isn't it? I heard that couple of decades ago, the exchange rate was even Php 1 = US$. I can't believe it coz now it's Php 56 = US$ 1!!!!!! My poor poor poor (literally!) country. I don't know how we can ever get up from the slump we are in. I don't think our Government would be any help. 

 Oh well (sigh)... on a much cheerful note, I think I'm gonna go to Singapore. I've done some "research" and I think Singapore is more fun and more fulfilling for me. I think I wanna go to that underwater world and ride a dolphin (although it would offend the animal rights activists), I just can't let that pass. I wonder if I'll get to ride an elephant too and conquer my fear of heights!!! I'm getting excited by the minute. I just hope there'll be good weather on 11th June since it's already typhoon season here... grrr.... Better get our tickets!!! 

 P. S. I have this feeling that I'm missing someone, but I don't know who... (???)

       It's final, we're not going to Puerto Gallera! Sob..sob... Ok, I'm a hypocrite, I'm not actually that disappointed coz I wanna go somewhere else. Hehe. I wanna to to Thailand - Phuket or Pattaya or wherever there's a beach! At first, I wanna go to Thailand, but now I'm thinking of going to Singapore. But... I don't think there is that much beach resorts in Singapore. So, I'm getting confused! Waaaa.... All I ever wanted was to go to a beach and get a TAN (although I'm already naturally tanned...hehe)!!! 

 Anyways, I'm going with Mel this time instead of Anna and Mharj. Mel will email Erin first then whatever his reply would kinda determine where we'll find ourselves on the 11th (June). I was hoping I can hit two birds (beach and scenic spots) with one stone but it's either Singapore with it's wonderful spots and city and shopping (!) or Thailand with it's beaches and "bitches" (hehe! kidding...it just rhymes, no offense meant!). Oh well, I'll just concentrate for now on losing some pounds. ;-) Btw, did I mention that besides taebo, I also have ballroom workshop on Tues and Thurs? :-D 

 It's rainy season again, one of the reasons why we didn't push through with our plans. I guess we'll just have to make do with our bar-hopping plans. Wonder if that will materialize. *sigh*

       I'm having an insecurity attack. I hate it when this happens. I think having a low self-esteem has made me insecure and resulting to my shyness. I prolly have very high expectations and not meeting these very high expectations has made me feel like I'm not living up to the ideal person that I should be. Right now, I feel so ugly and stupid with due to no apparent incedent. Nothing bad really happened to me. All I did was look around see this very pretty girl and suddenly I felt unpretty. Must be stupid of me to end up feeling this way. I feel like succombing to my vanity, but I'll try not to give in to it or else I won't be going anywhere for the next couple of months. 

 If I have to say so, I think my having a panic attack when I talk to guys is due to the fact that I'm scared they might see some physical flaws in me when I'm up close. Looking back and trying to analyze it again, that's the reason that I come up with. It's kinda subconscious and I realized it just now. I keep thinking they might find my nose or teeth or eyes ugly and they won't talk to me again or something. That is prolly why I get defensive and not talk to them at all. I sound like a psycho don't I? I'm prolly a psychologist's dream client. The ultimate reason why all those self-help books are being published. I give them credit though coz sometimes they do help, although it's temporary...prolly until a day or two after I read theire book. Then afterwards, I forget the "wisdom" that they have shared with me. I guess it does take practice. 

 It's raining again. I hope there'll be good weather on the 11th of June so we can push through with our plans to Sing... I wish I was going with ryan. What euphoria! (Ooops, sorry mel.) hehe... hmmm... i wonder what it will be like to share a room with him... ;-)/p>

 Nways, I found this on the web (from PageWise, Inc.)and I think I'm gonna try to do it. I'm a fighter and I'll never give up on my insecurities!!! 

  An assertive person could leave an aggressive type of person speechless with the right tools. A common problem regarding assertiveness is that people are fearful of displeasing others. Carefully choosing their responses to appease the listener. In the end you are angry with yourself after trying to make other people happy; now creating more stress in your life. It is much easier to be assertive, and then people know where you stand. The way in which we communicate is how we present ourselves. Whether it is aggressive, assertive or passive.  

 Assertiveness is expressing you honestly and in a direct manner. Generally an assertive person can be a team player and an effective problem solver. There are a variety of tools to use when practicing the art of assertion. Audiotapes and books are available; sometimes employers can provide these tools. This is a practical place to begin when learning to be more assertive.  

 Body language is an important key to assertiveness. Always maintain eye contact when speaking to others, stand tall keeping good posture. People can get the wrong message from you if you dont make eye contact. They may feel that you arent interested in what they have to say. The assertive person should always be a good listener. You want others to listen when you express yourself and you should give the same in return. Let others know that you care about what they are saying. This in turn builds a respectful relationship. When you are talking be sure to express your intent clearly, do not leave room for people to second guess you. Dont accuse or try to appear better than others. (That is an aggressive characteristic). State how you feel and why and dont be afraid to ask why when someone makes demands on you. Straightforwardness is a crucial key to becoming assertive.  

 While acquiring this skill, you will increase your level of self-esteem. Once you master the skill of assertion you will find your relationships in the workplace and personal life will greatly improve. You will feel more in control of your life and your surroundings. Remember practice makes perfect!

       Right after talking to the only person who can make me this happy, I was so happy (redundant huh)! I felt so light and so relaxed at lunch (I was alone) that I ended up talking with this girl I was sitting with (I asked if we can share the same table), which I don't usually do. It's weird how when you're in good mood you always feel so lightheaded and oh so friendly... or maybe it's just me. 

 Nways, yah you "heard" me right. I did "talk" to him. He came online. Talk about a pleasant surprise. He always does that - surprise me. Just when I least expected it he calls me up or come online or something like that. I tot he just came to leave one of those offline message. Luckily, I was online today. I mean I haven't been online for a looooooooooong time! Perhaps due to lack of "motivation". hehe! I'm so happy he came online (did I say that already?lol)! I don't think I'll ever get bored or tired talking to him. 

 As for that shy comment that he said, I guess he was right on target. I am really a shy person. Must be hard to believe for some but some people can see through me. Both my references for this job mentioned how "analytical, smart, effective, etc. etc." I am but in the end mentioned my shyness as a weakness. Must be why I'm quite reserved. I don't talk much, although one reason for not doing so is that I don't see any point in talking sometimes. I remember when I was in high school, this older guy (prolly 5-7 years older) used to have a crush on me (blush..blush..)and used to sing "little shy girl" everytime he passes by me. It was worst when I was younger. Part of it may be because I studied in a girls school which is why when I transfered to a co-ed school I have a panic attack when I talk to boys. Really funny when you think about it but up untl today I still have panic attacks when I'm talking to a guy - unless he's old enough to be my father. lol Speaking of, I just remembered I didn't say thank you to this Portuguese officer (it was his b-day yesterday and everyone in the division was there) and didn't even greet him when he gave a cup of red wine. He prolly thinks I'm the rudest person alive! Nyaiks! Or worst, he prolly thinks Filipinos are rude!! Sorry everyone! Oh well, next time, I just try to pretend that I'm not shy at all. Have to depend on my acting skills.  

 Well, well..it's basically a good first half of the week...slow but good. We learned cha cha yesterday at our ballroom class. It was funny though coz there was this German or some European couple (who doesn't speak English)who almost ended up fighting coz the guy doesnt want to dance anymore and his wife is forcing him to. Pretty funny when you see them argue. I hope they don't end up divorced coz of that though. hehe. 

 I guess it's time for me to go and attend that mass (at church) that I missed at lunch. Btw, I went to the clinic and see this internist doctor something and told me that I'm prolly hyperacidic and gave me some meds which costs a fortune. Thank goodness 80% is covered by my med insurance or else..waaaaaaa... I hope I'll get cured and it's not ulcer. It's prolly just stress. 

 I don't feel tired at all yet! *smiling from ear to ear*

       This morning, on my way to work, I sat beside this really cute guy... tall, hairy, great eyes and lashes, and not to mention he really smells good (my ultimate weakness!). But, that's about it, I just sat beside a cute guy. As usual, nothing happened, not because he didn't notice me or anything. Modesty aside, I think he actually found me "attractive", prolly for lack of attractive people around. Like I'm the prettiest among the ugliest. Hehe!!! Or maybe coz I'm wearing a skirt (I found out that men usually like women on skirts! Proven!) Nways, I was wearing this really dark glasses and I can see him at my pheriperal and catch him looking at me or giving me side glances. We got off at the same bus stop to take the train (our equivalent of a subway). And that's where it ended - he had to wait on queue to get his ticket while I already have my prepaid ticket. So, off I go and he was really looking at me like he wanted me to wait for him or something (this time I'm not exaggerating!). But, even if I find him attractive, I just can't make myself wait for him. I mean, I don't even know him!!! Besides, he should have spoken to me while we were still sitting beside each other at the bus. I don't blame him though coz people (esp. men) tell me that they find me unapproachable and aloof (not to mention snotty!). It's not like I do it on purpose. It just happens!  

 Oh well, I don't really feel like it's my loss that I didn't get to meet that guy coz I know that nothing will come out of that. It's either I'll be overcome with love and for this other guy I think I'm still inlove with or I'll lose interest as soon as I get to know him. So, no point pursuing it. It doesn't mean though that I wanna be like this forever. I do exert effort in being friendly to people but I just find it a total waste of time to talk to people I don't know well about trivial things. Even smiling is too much of an effort for me too. Oh well... maybe some people are like me...  

 I'm currently listening to the cd that "ryan" aka janu gave me years back. It's kinda sweet of him to compile that cd and I feel like I'm about to cry. Makes me reminisce about how things were. We do fight a lot before but still we talk often. Why can't things stay the way they are? Is "change" really the only permanent thing in this world? I really really miss him and what really frustrates me is that I have no power over the situation. This is another human being we are talking about - with his own feelings, thoughts, etc. and I can't force upon him my own thoughts and feelings when he does have his own set of brain and heart! I just wish I know what's he's going through and what's up with him... oh well, some wishful thinking! 

 I feel so empty. I don't think this void will ever be filled up by anyone (except him) EVER. Foolish love.

       This whole week was very hectic for me having my one whole week induction as a new staff (ya ya, it's quite late getting inducted on my 4th month) and trying to catch up with the work load. 

 I'm a new staff indeed (at work) but I'm not new to this life as I am turning 27 on Monday. I wonder what life at 27 brings for me. Some people might have been married about this time but I just can't quite imagine myself getting there yet. I still feel that I'm too young for that. This guy at my induction actually thought I'm only 18 (max of 20) yrs. old and that it's only my first job. I don't wanna be a hypocrite so I'm gonna admit that I'm quite flattered. *blush* 

 Ok, so it's my birthday on Monday. I'm not expecting any gifts as usual. My mom had always thought (even long long ago) that I'm too rich to be give a gift. She doesn't know though that I've always wanted a gift (anything!) from her. I'm not having a party either. If my "friends" remember that it's my birthday I'll prolly treat them someplace for lunch. But, if they don't, why should I?  

 Anyways, I'm quite tired now. I'll prolly mention somethings about my induction on my next blog. Haaaaaaaaaay...I suddenly feel like I'm 50! 

 I don't wanna admit this coz he might be reading this blog and might think I'm dropping hints or something which I absolutely am NOT, but I really missed getting "gifts" (which happened twice I think) from Janu. Getting cd and simple somethings from him always makes things real for me. Haven't heard from him though and I truly miss him!

       I know... I know... This entry is long overdue. I've been so busy with work and being lazy that I haven't blogged for awhile. 

 Contrary to what has been planned, my friend (Mel) and I decided to go to Bangkok (Thailand) instead of Singapore. We're not sorry though coz we had a real great time! That place is GREAT! I can't wait to go back there. 3 days and 4 nights is too short! 

 Ok, let me go back to the beginning. We got there like 11 evening and Erin (Mel's friend) picked us up at the airport. He's been waiting there for an hour (I guess there's some confusion with the time since BKK time is an hour late from MLA time), which I guess makes him very patient.LOL Then, instead of checking in into our hotel, we decided to stay in his apartment and check in the next day. But, before we headed to his apt, we had our late dinner first. It's a pretty weird place, that restaurant. I mean there are too many gays in that place. Erin said it's because it's raining so they're hanging out on that part of the city. But, it's really weird coz 98% of the people I see are gays. Nways, we had a little catching up here and there since it's been 2 years (?) since we've all seen each other. 

 Erin was this 28 yrs old american guy whom I've met thru Mel when he came to Manila couple of years ago. We used to argue with each other a lot and don't get along well. He thinks he's too smart just because he's got his BA and some MA from Standford! Then he hooked up with some other girl who's also with us. Now, that girl is married to someone else and he's seeing someone else too. Nways, he has since left the US military (I don't know if captain of which branch whatever) and has been in BKK for 3 or so months wasting his life away. He said he's writing some kind of a book whatever but I don't buy it. Nways, he's going to be our guide so we both decided to have a truce. We didn't argue this time. 

 Mel and I ended up sleeping on his bed (he sleep on the couch), which is quite uncomfy, coz I kept thinking about him bringing some girl to his apt and sleeping in that bed. Good thing we have our own little blankets. I'm really not comfy about sleeping in someone else's house esp. since I have to do my evening routine like washing my face, etc. I have this long "ritual" which I started just lately and they've been like waiting for me to finish.LOL Then I have to read too before I go to sleep. 

 Nways, I don't have to talk about all that. That's not the point of blogging. I wanna tell you what I've done in BKK. As I've said before, it's a pretty cool place esp. at night. Seems like everyone comes to life at night. I love the food and the different kinds of restaurant. During the first night, we ate at this Indian-Pakistani-Bangladeshi restaurant and it's quite an experience for me. I mean, I've never washed my hands on the table. They brought some sort of a small basin with lime in it and you wash your hands on that basin. The food was great too, unlike Filipino foods which sucks. Then the following night we went to another restaurant, an Egyptian resto this time, and the people there I find a bit scary. They have this really "strong" face like they're mad at you or something and some of the men looks at me like they're gonna eat me alive. I don't mean to sound conceited or whatever, but that's what happened. I look this way then the other way and see someone looking at me too closely. But, I have to give credit to the place though coz the food was good and is quite clean. I'm just not used to being looked at too closely and they don't look away eventhough I catch them looking. Strange. 

 A BKK "adventure" would never be complete unless you've been to a girlie bar or "go-go bar". Don't tell my mom though.*wink* Don't fret coz they're still "fully covered" in g-stringed bikini and bra. Hehe. I've never been to that totally naked bar due to lack of time, which is very unfortunate. Hehe. Nways, we didn't stay too long though coz we got bored looking at those women after a while. They are pretty and sexy although some are a bit on the fat side. I love the drink too, but I dunno what it's called. It's like choclate drink with a few drops of brandy and lots of ice. I like it but I only had one glass of it coz I don't wanna get drunk! 

 Next we went to this salsa club which is the coolest place of all! I love to dance and I've been taking ballroom classes for the past weeks. So, this salsa club is such a treat to me coz there isn't a place like this in the Manila. I can't believe lots of young people are interested in this type of dance. In Manila it's usually the elderly and the matrons with their young dance instructors who frequent such place in hotels. So, I was quite surprised to see those people in the dance floor. Nways, Erin and I danced for a while (he's a good dancer and had some sort of lesson in the US) then this South American guy (whom Erin warned us not to dance with but ended up dancing with him coz I didn't know it was the same guy!)danced with me too.  This guy usually ask his partner to go home with him or something, good thing he didn't pull the same prank at me! At the end of the dance though I thought he was saying something and I leaned over to hear what he's saying. Before I know it he has cheek-kissed with me. I was like whoo what's that. So, I looked around to see if everyone is supposed to do that but they're not. It was just me. Good thing it was just his cheeks coz they're no way I'm gonna let someone kiss my cheek with their lips. I mean I don't even know him. Nways, I just ignored what happened and didn't make a big deal out of it, but the next time he asked me for a dance I said NO. Well, all in all the people at the bar were very nice. I've dance with a very pretty Indian girl and she was very nice. If I stayed longer, I would have been friends with her. Hmm... wonder why Erin didn't like her. 

 Now to my day life! It's just Mel and me this time, which was fun coz we're all by ourselves! Thai words are quite difficult to remember so I'll prolly just mention those names that has an English name and describe the rest to you. I love museums so that's the first place I went - the National Museum. It was not so interesting as our local National Museum. I guess you have to be in the exact spot where history happened to appreciate it. It's all pictures and dioramas and displays. Not to mention lots of Buddhas. The structure of the building was cool though. Looks like one of those Chinese pagodas, which is prolly one of Chinese influence. Then we went to see the golden Buddha, whcih according to our guide is 95% solid gold, which makes me wanna scratch it and get some gold powders. hehe. Then to the giant Buddha. Seems like everywhere we go are Buddhas. Mel even bought this Budhha holy water. I asked her if she wanna convert, thus, the mineral water to which she realized her mistake. I respect the Thai's faith and belief in the Buddha but I don't believe in him. I agree with his teachings and philosophy though. 

 It's like every building in Bangkok (or maybe the whole Thailand!) has this small altar with a Buddha in it and some flowers and insense. They even have one in the middle of the go-go bars district!!! I find it weird though, but nothing to laugh at. They're really nice people so if that's what they become for believing in Buddha then I have nothing against that! 

 After the Buddhas, we went shopping to this open bazaar and it was a shopping haven. Lots of tourists everywhere! Then went to their mall and ate the most delicious food during my travel and the most delicious coffee shake (w/ a scoop of choco ice cream!) I have ever tasted! I'm even thinking about that meal right this very moment! Too bad they don't have it here at Starbucks! 
 
 At the Grand Palace, Erin came with us. They had to change into "respectable" clothes and shoes though before they can get in. So, they had to rent it at the entrance. It was a beautiful place and the art works were fantastic. It's quite similar to the Indian temples though and once inside, if you saw one temple you feel like you've seen them all. Several Buddhas (20 or so) in front then lots of worshippers' flowers, insense etc. and the artwork on the wall was cool. Unfortunately, I don't know anything about their history so I don't have any idea what stories they tell. 

 After the Grad Palace, we had to rush to our hotel since our transport will be picking us up at 12NN! It really sucks! I wanted to stay longer na! But, we can't NOT go home! Work is waiting! Reality is waiting. 

 Nways, I have to tell you about this Erin guy. It's pretty funny the way Mel puts it. When we got back, I just said thanks to him thru sms since I kinda rushed that PM and didn't thank him properly. Then he started bugging Mel and kept asking "does Jessa like me?". Mel asked him "what do u think? y? do u like her?". He said yes he likes me coz I'm really great and I'm smart and I'm fun to be with, etc. Then he said he doesn't think I like him. Then started bugging Mel again but didn't get an answer from her. The funny part is that Mel told me that when we were in BKK, he keeps on looking at me in a lovesick puppy way everytime he thinks I'm not looking. Sometimes, I catch him doing that but I just ignore it. But, Mel keeps on watching him and noticed that he does that like 85% of the time we're together! It's so not like him considering that he's so obnoxious. It's hard to imagine him looking dreamily at me. I have to admit that I'm quite flattered. It's only normal. I don't have to be a hypocrite at my own blog. 

 Oh well, it's back to normal again. Work and no play. I still wanna go to the beach coz I've never been to the beach in Thailand. Time was too short. 

 When I think about beach, I always think about Janu. He's one very difficult guy to get. Miss him so! If you didn't get bored with this entry and you're reading up to this point, pls. drop by online and say hi. ilu!

       After flirting with all the guys around, I always end up coming back to my one and only janu. I really really really miss him. I haven't heard from him for a long time. At first, flirting with other guys has amused me but now it seems so pointless. I just want one guy, a guy who's never around. It this pointless too?

       I don't feel lazy about work or anything, I just feel lazy about blogging. Seems like I have nothing else to say, which is uncommon for me. I mean I'm the kind of person who always has something to say whether it's full of crap or sensible. I just feel empty. 

 Nways, I'm only blogging coz I haven't heard from janu for a long time. I wonder what he's up to. I sent him an email with my pics from Bangkok recently but I haven't heard neither hi nor ho. I miss him, but he's prolly busy and occupied with a lot of things. Sometimes I feel guilty about imposing on him too much. I feel so burdensome to him and too confining. I mean he prolly wants to go into dating or stuff and I hope I'm not keeping him from doing what he wants and from growing up. Maybe we can be friends for the meantime while we're waiting to meet each other so it won't be too burdensome on him. In a way, he can explore some other "possibilities". It doesn't make any difference, right? I remember he told me once whether we break up or not, there's no difference and I ended up crying. What a cry baby! He later said that he's just kidding though. I guess if we're meant to be, we're meant to be. *sigh* I really miss him I wanted to cry.:-( Oh well, it must be the weather again. There's a typhoon going on.

       I have ben eating alot lately. And I really mean ALOT! I have this urge to eat all the time, not to mention making a lot of charges on my credit just for food! This is not good I know, but this is how I react to depression. I remember I used to be soooo fat when I was a freshman in college. That was the time I was living away from home and when my gandma died. I hope I won't get that far. I better get my act together or else...  Anyways, I promise myself I'll get my act together. All this food will only make me more depressed afterwards. Next week I promise myself I'll get back to attending my taebo classes which I skipped for 2 weeks already. I'm starting to feel heavy and ugly. Speaking of ugly, my friend told me that her brother thinks I'm cute. Well, not that it matters to me, but still I'm flattered. I haven't actually met him, he just saw me at their sister's funeral. Then he asked my friend "who's that girl with the long hair? she has great eyes and rosy cheeks". Hmm...I haven't actually considered myself as having rosy cheeks but I guess there was a glow on my face that time coz I was kinda sleepy already.  Well, I'm going home now. At least, today, Mel would be waiting for me at home. I can't bear to be alone right now. I can't bear the silence in our house. It's just me and my dad and we don't talk alot, except when we argue. hehe. Bad daughter me. Nothing serious though.  Buh-bye!  &nbsp;

       I really miss my Trix! I was used to her always being there that the house feel so empty without her. I still can't comprehend that she's not there anymore. Such a sad ending for such a beautiful creature.  The other night, I ended up calling janu. It's quite expensive and not within my budget but I think I'll go crazy if I don't talk to anyone. I was thinking janu can cheer me up and he did. It's such a relief just talking to him. At first though he was not answering the phone, so I thought he was trying to avoid me. I mean, I haven't talked to him for a looooooooong time. So, I kinda feared that "this is it...he's gonna leave me". But, then he answered the phone after a few more minutes. It was such a pleasant talk. Kinda reminded me why I fell inlove with him in the first place. It all came rushing back to me. He laughed about the silliness of my crying for Trixie but I know deep inside me that he understands and that he sympathize with me. I guess he just don't want me to cry and be sad. He has this way of trying to calm me or cheer me up. At least I was lightened up enough to go to sleep afterwards. I really love him that night. I just hope he'll drop by and say hi one of these days.  Btw, I've posted this poem in the in-memory-of-pets website. Here's the  urlLink site  with her most recent pic, just right after a haircute.:)  I love you always. You are the best thing that happened to me.   &nbsp;  Well, another best thing that happened to me is you, janu. But you don't even realize that. Hmp!  &nbsp;

       I have never imagine I would be saying those words one day. I just couldn't imagine my beloved pet being dead and leaving me. I always thought I would be the one who will leave her if ever I go and live in a different country or something. Even that is not a situation that I would accept without doing anything. I've always thought I would be bringing her wherever I go. 

 My dad found her this morning, just before I leave for work, and I thought he was saying trixie vomited again. So, I just went on with what I was doing, but the urgency in his voice told something bad has happened so I went out to take a look. I couldn't believe what I saw. My dearest trixie is dead. She jumped from the table and choked herself to death. When I saw her this morning, she doesn't look dead to me. She's even still warm and soft and pretty. Her eyes are open like she's surprised or something. It's my fault really. Coz if I didn't leave her on that table with a rope on her neck last night, she would still be alive! I'm so STUPID!!!!! 

 Trixie has been with me since February of 2000. Right after I broke up with Erhiz (the guy who broke my heart!) and she's been my friend who gave me love and comfort and affection. She made me smile again. The first time I saw her, I fell inlove with her immediately. She was so white and furry and I couldn't resist her big brown eyes and pink nose. So, I did everything in my power to finally have her. I don't know where Doreena (the lesbian who was so obsessed with me that time!) got her but I don't care. Of all the things that she has done, introducing me to Trixie was all worth it. Then, I brought her here to Manila. I practically bring her with me everywhere I go! 

 Trixie has been with me for 4-1/2 years and now she's gone. She's always been with me thru my ups and downs. I don't have any friends I truly confide in except my diary and somehow talking to her somehow relieves me. She just looks at me with those intelligent brown eyes as if she understands any words I say. She prolly just love my talking to her coz she's always like hungry for my company. She's prolly the only one hungry for my company. 

 Some might say that crying for a pet is silly and childish. But, when you have a pet as wonderful as Trixie, you won't find it silly at all. We have fun together and she doesn't cry like a dog. She cries in a sort of way that is unique, sometimes like a bird or a high pitch bark demanding for attention. When she hears my voice she gets excited and tries to take a pick inside our house by putting her small head in-between the window. She's so cute when she does that. She's also the jealous type. She doesn't want me to play with or hug anyone else, even my mom! But, then she sometimes don't want anyone else to hug my mom but her. Quite silly. And when she wants something, she doesn't stop bugging us until she gets it. Kinda like me, huh. 

 I hate to think that I won't see her ever again. I mean when I get home, she's always the first one I see and she's so overjoyed to see me she'll start jumping and wagging her tail at the same time. It really hurts to think about it. My mind is so full of "should haves" I think it'll drive me crazy. My eyes are now swollen from crying since this morning on the way to work until now. I just have to control myself coz when I cry my nose really gets red like Rudolph. Nways, it really hurts to lose my Trixie. In fact, I don't know how I can manage it now that our house will be so quiet without her. Even my dad like her alot and he doesn't even like pets. That's how much likeable Trixie is. 

 Now, I don't know whether I should get another dog or not. I don't feel like getting another one since I'll just be comparing her to Trixie. I don't think she'll ever live up to her. I mean she's so "maarte" she doesn't even want to wet her feet on her urine. She hops from her own piss coz she doesn't want her feet to get wet. And she hates it when her surrounding is dirty. I wonder if some other dog will be as "maarte" as she is. So, I don't think I want to have another pet EVER. But, I'm thinking too of looking for Doreena (I'll risk her obsession!) and try to get another dog that looks like Trix). I don't think I'll ever find anotehr poodle terrier like her coz she has pink nose and brown eyes coz they usually have black nose and eyes. I don't think I'll ever be able to replace her. She's the only pet that I had in my whole life. I never used to like dogs but when I saw her... 

 It's so hard to lose someone. Accepting that I won't be seeing her in the future is hard. Just like when you break up with your boyfriend but more coz this time you'll never see her again. It's so hard to put into words. I just feel like crying everytime I remember that she's dead. Like when I'm doing something and I'm reminded of her death, I feel like I can't breathe. It really hurts. I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo DEPRESSED! I just lost the one that I love most. Trixie.

       Last week was the busiest that I have ever been!!! I didn't even have time to blog. But, it doesn't mean that I didn't have time to eat though. :(( And I missed one taebo class (and I only have two taebo classes in a week!). So, I'm not surprised when everyone I bump into tells me that I've gained weight. In just 2 weeks!!!! I really really better get my act together or else I'll have a hard time losing wieght!  It's weird though, coz lately I've been getting all these attention from men. My friend even told me that I look different and she doesn't know why. It's like I'm some kind of a late bloomer. My colleague even told me, right after some guy called me up from our resident mission in Pakistant (!), that I have a lot of boys now which she says is good. I don't consider that guy as a "potential" though but only as one of my networks. I mean it helps to know someone from the resident mission, just in case our office needs something. Besides, a guy calling you up doesn't mean he's courting you. Why can't I have guy friends without them misinterpretnig it! It's weird how people can be a little narrow-minded sometimes. They think everything about the opposite sex is about "romance".  I don't wanna put into detail this "raining men" issue. It's not like it's an outpour, it's just a drizzle. hehe. Just 4-5 guys showing interests and some looks here and there. I'm really flattered but I don't wanna be conceited and start counting and putting everything into detail. All I can say is that I think men like girls who are confident, but not to the point of being arrogant. It doesn't change anything though coz I'm still as snotty as hell and I don't think I'll be other than that. :((  Speaking of men, I'm happy about the way things are going with Jan. I don't wanna spoil everything by talking about every detail.&nbsp;Besides, it can be too shallow for some and such a big deal for me. I'm just happy that he's paying me some attention again and even sent me an sms. I wonder what he "needs" to send me though. I&nbsp;hope he's not returning any of the stuff I gave him! :)  I still miss trix. And my dad is redoing our terrace so I'm missing her more. I kept thinking that&nbsp;trix would have liked the new terrace or it would be fun to see her play. Maybe it's just still too soon to forget about her. Maybe in due time, it won't won't hurt this much anymore and will become part of my happy memories' databank.  PS: I sent jan some of my pics from Bangkok&nbsp;but I wonder if he got it or if he liked it.*sigh*  PSS: Elinore, if you're reading this, thanks for dropping by. I'll come online and chat with you one of these days. Who knows, maybe I can do it today. :)  &nbsp;

       One would thing that being single and restless at the same time is a bad combination and I tell you - IT IS! What comes to mind though is that these single people who experience some sort of restlessness ends up doing something stupid or WILD in an attempt to assuage the feeling. But in my case, I was born tamed so no such wild thoughts sprung up to my mind. I guess some people are just born "behaved" *wink*. It doesn't mean though that I don't have any "wild" ideas of my own, it's just that I don't succomb to the temptation of&nbsp;doing something wild since&nbsp;I'm scared of things that are "un-doable".  &nbsp;  It's Friday and guess what? I don't even have any plans&nbsp;this weekend. What a pathetic&nbsp;life! I'm 27 and single for goodness sakes! If only I was a flirt, I would be out with some guy this instant, but I'm not and I'm not even sorry that I'm not. I don't wanna go through all that trouble of dating just for the reason of dating.&nbsp;Nways, Mel won't be around this weekend or on the next&nbsp;2 weekends after that&nbsp;so I guess I'm on my own for that duration.&nbsp;I'm not at all&nbsp;worried or grouchy about not going out. I'm just saving some energy for the mid-August. I'm planning on going out-of-town and going&nbsp;to some beach and&nbsp;be&nbsp;a bitch. hehe. I hope the weather won't be such a killjoy though. 

  Oh well, I'm just talking here about some nonsense. I better go and watch some ovie at the mall. Prolly eat a bunch of popcorn. I miss jan though. I don't know why I keep on missing him. I mean I miss him in the morning, at night, why watching movies, even right after we talked on the phone. It's kinda scary and pathetic. I just hope he misses me the same way or just plain misses me sometimes. I sound like a loser I wanted to cry! Waaaaaa... But no, I'm not gonna cry. I should count my blessings! I have a good-paying job and what else.... I'll&nbsp;save the rest to myself. 

  Gotta go! 

  P. S. I miss miss miss him soooooooooo much!

      I am physically, mentally and emotionally tired! I'm sooooo not happy with how my life is going and I don't know how to fix it! I maybe stressed or maybe I'm starting to hate my dad, but no matter what, I just dont feel like going home. I also miss janu but he's so not here and I wanna call him but I just don't have the time and the means. It's sooooo expensive to call. I hope he'll drop me a line at this blog just to make me feel better. Anything will do or else I'll go crazy! I feel sooo alone!!!
