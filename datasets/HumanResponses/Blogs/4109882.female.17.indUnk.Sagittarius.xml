      ahh i just heard that song. no matter what type of mood im in that song always makes me cry. so many things attached with that song. lol. its kinda sad, because i dont even know why i cry to that song.. it really aint all that serious. yennoe? i guess because i wish i had someone to be my hero, i know it sounds pathetic, but no one ever really shows me that compassionate feeling, except my mom, but that aint the same. i guess that would also be my fault, cause at times im a major bitch. then i see people who are much more bitchier then me and they have a person. i guess im just upset because no matter what i always like someone but they never like me back, which sucks... but whatever im gonna go before i upset myself more, im baking a cake and talking so i need concentration !

      goodness. i dont know it's so strange to say but i again feel the same way, except this time i was not so afraid to just be me, of course i was not fully deana, i was not afraid to talk though. i think college has done this to me. i know it sounds crazy but it is the truth.  i am torn though. i can't seem to find what exactly it is that i want. life has been rough for me, and i really don't care about many things, but then i see how much other people have been through, and i'm glad i have been through what i was through and not what they were. somethings make us stronger, and everything i have been through just makes me more comfortable with who i am, and being glad i am who i am, and that i'm not anyone else.  my mind keeps going off, tonight all i can seem to think about way way back in my head, is my grandma. i miss her so much i just wish i could tell her how much im sorry for what i have put her through, she did not deserve it. i really loved her, she was the best person ever.  she tried to help everyone. my nanny had the biggest heart in the world, and when she died, she took half of me with her, i wish she never died, i really wish she did not. i always thought i'd die before her, i swore she was never going to die. i used to say to her they don't want you in heaven or hell nanny. your never going to go away, but she did, and i died along with her.  i can not say i have been happy at all since she passed. yeah i have had my times when i would smile and laugh and be happy, but for it to last more than a day no. i have been thinking about her lately, and how proud she would be of me. i cried so much, but no matter how many tears i cry she won't come back, and that breaks my heart even more.  well i am going to truly have my mind in the starz because i am extremely tired. so goodnight and have a STARLIT night
