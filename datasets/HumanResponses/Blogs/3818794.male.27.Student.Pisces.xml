      So with all the thunder and lighting last night I decided to set both my alarm clock and my phone to wake me up. I didn't want to risk missing my first 'class' at the gym. Apparently I was more worried than I realized because I had a dream where I was riding a very small car and crashed into the back of two other cars on the way to the gym. One was driven by the cute boy I saw at work yesterday and the other by Jessica Simpson. We found ourselves sitting on a balcony discussing the damage. Before I knew it I was crying because I was uninsured (yeah right!). The cars were wrecked but Jessica offered to lend me the money to get a new ride so I wouldn't miss my gym appointment. Then I rode a new tiny car to my friend Franks house where he was sleeping. I proceeded to take a hurried shower and then zipped out the door and down the highway. I never made it to the gym.   Friggin' bizarre.  ------------  On a better note, I did actually go to the gym this morning - it was awesome!

      Last year I joined my sister's gym in hopes of getting into shape. Her boyfriend even offered to show me how to weight train for a few weeks until his job took him up north for the summer. Lacking the motivation (read: courage) to continue figuring this out on my own, I relegated myself to the elliptical machines. I'd longingly look at the weight machines and wonder what to do, but after my time was up on the elliptical I'd quickly scurry out the door. Then I found out the gym will help you design a fitness program and show you how to use all the equipment for free - what a bonehead! I can't believe I took so long to ask.  Anyway, I have an appointment tomorrow morning. Can't wait!

      Today is not going well. Not in the sense that anything really bad happened - all in all I'm great. I feel great, I look great, but I'm making mistakes left and right. I noticed early today that something wasn't right. I work in a copy center and for the life of me I couldn't seem to hit the right buttons on the machine. I had to recycled more botched jobs today than I care to admit.  Normally I have no problem answering questions or ringing up people's orders, but today I was fumble fingers and mumble mouth. "Everything he touches turns to shit!" Then I saw him. The super cutie in the paper aisle. He was with a friend. They stood there puzzling over which paper to buy. I should have realized that there was no possibility of striking up a conversation without mussing things up, but did that stop me? Of course not, today is Idiot Day.   He wanted to know if a certain pack of paper was glossy or not. How simple a question! I knew that it was not, but do you think I could manage a simple no? Of course not, today is Idiot Day. As I sat there struggling to open the package of paper to double check that it was, indeed, not glossy paper I thought about how much better it would have been if I had never gotten out of bed.   There is nothing worse than trying to look your sexiest while fighting to remove a plastic wrapper. Just ask anyone who's ever tried to open a condom  after  things get busy.  Anyway, it all went downhill from there. I'm going to bed.   P.S. I accidentally closed my browser while typing this entry. I had to retype it all. I give up!

      It's Thursday night and I'm supposed to be writing an email to this guy I'm sort-of seeing. Somehow I encountered an ad for Blogger and 6 minutes later I find myself writing my first entry. Is this the ultimate form of procrastination or am I really just a space cadet? You'll have to decide for yourself.
