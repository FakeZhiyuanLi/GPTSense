       "A man walks along a tight, narrow corridor. He can not lift his head, and he can not stretch his arms. He has no room to turn opposite, or off his path. The man senses a feeling of suffocation. To his left, is righteous passage. Ahead, is necessity. But on his right, is immediacy. He maintains a shifty balance so long as his eyes do not sway to his left, nor his right. He knows that there is but a foots distance between him and a dead end on either side of him. If he loses balance, he will fall into unknown space. His option is to proceed ahead. He proceeds dubiously."~A 1/16 Cherokee Indian.      I believe we flee a situation that is a threat to something about ourselves we don't want to admit. We enjoy buying into the benighted sensibilities of a civilization that likes to project a romanticized fear. Because so long as we are in a state of fear, we can be kept at bay.   A distraction is continually being placed upon the masses: from the clothing we wear, to the families we raise, to the social marginal we fill. We are selling out. We are rolling over, and we are giving up and doing the best that we can. In the latter, we are fighting an internal struggle. Within the internal struggle we are noticing that we are miserably being mislead. At every angle we try to see it, we are being sent through a maze of flashy ads, glorified careers, and pseudo-philanthropic solutions. Evermore, we are ridiculously tapping along with the idea at any given moment we are&nbsp;being threated with the idea that we&nbsp;are uncultivated; that we are &nbsp;socially unstable. Others like to believe these things do not affect them, most don't even know that they do. Some know, and seek ways outside the paradigm, but fall miserably back to what's comfortable.   There are no more social icons, and there are no more warriors. There are no more martyrs.  We fight in silence.  We fight in the cold shadows of our fathers, and grandfathers. We no longer reckon with or console ourselves with who and where we come from, because our parents stood for nothing, and everything at once. Our parents lived in vain.  We are generation-X.&nbsp;  Our parents sold out. They gave in, and did the best they could. We watch in the sad hours of the night how they gave up. We watch as they struggle in the hours before dawn as they still awaken to a day that they must blister themselves to the bone. Because we all know that their retirement won't give them nearly what they're worth, or what they make working. They knew that this was coming for them. We see it in their eyes and in their words, and when they get frustrated to go to another day at work when they should have already retired. We can see it, that they've failed themselves and what their generation once stood for. We hear them speak like they&nbsp;owe us the world, because they do. We can also see the hope in them that we can get it done.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rely on luck to get where we need to, instead of working ourselves there. With game shows and scratch-its, and bullshit gimmicks. Because it seems we can no longer work ourselves to a comfortable position, because we no longer have the position.&nbsp;  So I say, "Go along,&nbsp;roll over, sleep it off with your post-modern slave-dream and hope to dream of a better day. When luck is a thing of the past and things happen as planned, and the idea that you if you work hard enough you can make&nbsp;things happen&nbsp;and that is&nbsp;the attitude that really gets things done. Keep up with your internal struggle and dialogue that with enough affirmations and proclamations, and desensitization you can dodge the corporate wall. But at the other end of that dream I'll see you still beating away at the same thing as you were the moment before you fell asleep. A comfortable place snug in your bed, thinking up complex ideas all in your head about what you could do differently in your own little world in your own little life to change your situation and make it better for yourself and those you love. Then, just when all your ideas drift off in your dream, you can see that your still left thinking, your doing the best that you can. By then you will be humbling yourself, and calling it some spiritual plan concocted by some ethereal god. When all-in-all, you're right, you're doing all that you can. Now it's time to take that outside of you, cause it's no longer coming from something you are or aren't doing. It's something outside igniting the fuel."    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      The Gun  Late afternoon light slices through the dormer window to your place on the floor next to a stack of comics. Across from you is a boy who at eleven is three years older.  He is telling you to pull down your pants. You tell him you don't want to.  His mother is out and you are alone in the house.  He has given you a Coke, let you smoke two of his mother's nonfilter Pall Malls, and years later you can still picture the red packet on the dark finish of the phonograph.  You stand up and say you have to go home.  You live across the street and only see him in summer when he returns from school. As you step around the comics toward the stairs, the boy gives you a shove, sends you stumbling back. Wait, he says, I want to show you something. He goes to a drawer and when he turns around you see he is holding a small gun by the barrel. You feel you are breathing glass.  You ask if it is loaded and he says, Sure it is, and you say: Show me. He removes the clip, takes a bullet from his pocket. See this, he says, then puts the bullet into the clip, slides the clip into the butt of the gun with a snap. The boy sits on the bed and pretends to study the gun. He has a round fat face and black hair.  Take off your pants, he says.  Again you say you have to go home. He stands up and points the gun at your legs.  Slowly, you unhook your cowboy belt, undo the metal buttons of your jeans.  The slide down past your knees. Pull down your underwear, he tells you.  You tell him you don't want to.  He points the gun at your head. You crouch on the floor, cover your head with your hands. You don't want him to see you cry.  You feel you are pulling yourself into yourself and soon you will be no bigger than a pebble.  You think back to the time you saw a friend's cocker spaniel hit by a car and you remember how its stomach was split open and you imagine your face split open and blood and gray stuff escaping. You have hardly ever thought of dying, seriously dying, and now as you grow more scared you have to go to the bathroom more and more badly.  Before you can stop yourself, you feel yourself pissing into your underwear. The boy with the gun sees the spreading pool of urine. You baby, he shouts, you baby, you're disgusting. You want to apologize, but the words jumble and choke in your throat.  Get out, the boy shouts. You drag your pants up over your wet underwear and run down the stairs.  As you slam out of his house, you know you died up there among the comic books and football pennants, died as sure as your friend's cocker spaniel, as sure as if the boy had shot your face off, shot the very piss out of you.  Standing in the street with urine soaking you pants, you watch your neighbors pursuing the orderly occupations of  a summer afternoon:  mowing a lawn, trimming a hedge. Where is that sense of the world you woke with this morning?  Now it is smaller.  Now it has gone away.
