      I met Guy at the Sydney Idol auditions on the 31st of May... It was my dream. I wasn't completly crushed by the thought that i didnt get into Idol because i reached my goal of meeting Guy!  I got through the first round but didn't make it through the second and I met heaps of cool people along the way. Everyone was so supportive of a shy and nervous girl they didn't know but they all decided to strike up a conversation with me. The whole experience was completly overwhelming it's something I'm not soon to forget.  Tara

      Hey,  I'm Tara, and I'm an alcoholic... just kidding.! I'm 16 and go to TAFE with bekky my bestie, she is a weird as me(that must be why we are sooooooo close) Anyway, being a teenager sux because: pressure rules teenage girls lives, suicide happens almost everyday and the fact that everytime guys masterbate, a kitten dies!!! (how sad is that?) i dont know weither that is true, but i heard it once!!!  Anyway, i went totally off subject! Teenage-hood should be about: constant partying and enjoying the fact that you aren't too old to not be able to act like a total dick and not make a fool of yourself! Old people these days spend thier time watching stupid soap operas while sipping tea and eating gross biscuits.  I dont think i ever wanna get old! Being young is too much fun. Besides, when youre old, you gotta wear old yukky clothes. Your fashion taste goes totally down to toilet. I'd rather stay young and wrinkle free!!!  Well, here's some stuff about me... I sing and am going in Australian Idol on the 31st of May, Bekky is taking me to the Sydney Auditions. I'm scared of DICKO. Jokes, i will let him have it if he makes me feel like crap.   So, going now... hope i humoured you somehow please say yes!!! Tara... :P

      today i am pissed off like no one would believe! i'm sick of guys and their pigheaded ways... Why is it that they never wanna lose an arguement, the fact that no matter what they say is always right and everything else that goes along with em... I dont think i will ever understand em... Tara.

      I sit here contemplating What steps to take next… The darkness is overcoming my life,  Black demons haunt my dreams,  And I feel as though darkness filling my very being…  I walk in the sunlight,  And must shade my eyes… “Are you okay?” They all ask,  I laugh at you,  “Do I look like I am?”  The brightness is killing me,  But I must run from the darkness,  I must have the brightness It is suffocating me… You sat there laughing at me… And so now, I laugh at you,  But I realize your soul is now failing me…  You look at me with eyes of horror,  And still I laugh… You beg for mercy,  And still I laugh… I feel something sticky on my hands,  And still I laugh… I see something red,  And still I laugh…  I hear the footsteps coming down the hallway… I hear voices… I hear you scream for them to save you,  Sorry, but you are beyond being saved now… I feel you grow limp in my arms… Your soul seems to be failing me… You seem sad… It seems like you wanted to say something,  But you never got the chance,  And so your soul is sad,  And so your soul is failing me…  They are coming after me… I run away and leave you there,  You failed me…

I sit here contemplating What steps to take next… The darkness is overcoming my life,  Black demons haunt my dreams,  And I feel as though darkness filling my very being…  I walk in the sunlight,  And must shade my eyes… “Are you okay?” They all ask,  I laugh at you,  “Do I look like I am?”  The brightness is killing me,  But I must run from the darkness,  I must have the brightness It is suffocating me… You sat there laughing at me… And so now, I laugh at you,  But I realize your soul is now failing me…  You look at me with eyes of horror,  And still I laugh… You beg for mercy,  And still I laugh… I feel something sticky on my hands,  And still I laugh… I see something red,  And still I laugh…  I hear the footsteps coming down the hallway… I hear voices… I hear you scream for them to save you,  Sorry, but you are beyond being saved now… I feel you grow limp in my arms… Your soul seems to be failing me… You seem sad… It seems like you wanted to say something,  But you never got the chance,  And so your soul is sad,  And so your soul is failing me…  They are coming after me… I run away and leave you there,  You failed me…

      Sometimes I feel Like I don't have a partner  Sometimes I feel  Like my only friend  Is the city I live in  The city of Angels  Lonely as I am  Together we cry I drive on her streets 'Cause she's my companion  I walk through her hills  'Cause she knows who I am  She sees my good deeds  And she kisses me windy  I never worry  Now that is a lie

      As the rain clouds form i know they form for you with teardrops in the starry skies and hues of black and grey locked in the sandstorm  distraught from the illusions of the palm tree's at play the fire is burning your eyes fixated in the moment a kiss goodbye  Broken Dreams  Dreams collapse, Shattered and lost, Mares of the night reign, Dark and ever growing;  Broken dreams Scream, Lost in an unearthly explosion Scattered;  Feathers shed like White snow, Wings withered and were No more;  Exiled from the White Lands, her Presence was no longer That of a saint;  Stoned by the Public, and Scarred by betrayal  And emotions;  Thrown to the black Darkness of the night, She retreats back Into the shelter of shadows;  Forgotten forever. Fallen angel.

      "And when your back's against the wall Just turn around and you will see i will catch, i will catch your fall Just have a little faith, faith in me"  I got stones in my passway  and my road seem dark as night I got stones in my passway  and my road seem dark as night I have pains in my hearts  they have taken my appetite   i cant understand myself anymore cause im still feeling lonely feeling so unholy  screw you, i am pretty  Anyone she has ever loved in her life she will always love just a little bit. She can't help it. It's just the way she is.   A perfect world exists you say? Then take my hand and show me the way.  "The good times of today, are the sad thoughts of tomorrow." - Bob Marley   I'm sick of crying, I'm sick of trying,Yeah I'm smiling but inside I'm dying  i'm still breaking old habits, habits when you pulled the wool over me i can see everything, everything remembering "jinx removing" don't worry i'll catch you [x2] don't ever worry no need for reminding... you're still all that matters to me  punk, goth, slut... only soup cans need a label...  ~Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tear.~ ~Friends are like stars they come and go... but the ones who stay are the ones who glow~ ~*~If you've ever pushed a door when it said pull, put this in your signature.~*~ ~*~If you've ever seriously wondered why they call them Apple Jacks, put this in your signature~*~   This hurt is too much to bear On such a damaged heart That the only thing I'm living off of Is the small hope That one day we can fix what we have broken   holding on to your grudge.. oh it's so hard to have someone to love. ..and keeping quiet is hard, cuz you can't keep a secret if it never was a secret to start..    PARENTS we all get lonely, and we all feel low, when you feel like you just have no place to go. but what we dont realise, and what we dont know, is that there are always 2 people who love us so.  never forget, about your mum and dad, the people who are there for you, even when they are mad, for as much as we say that we would be better on our own, they are the ones who make sure we are never alone.  Love  Hate Fear  Tears Love Kills Breaks Hearts Love  Is  Bad  "Everyone who lives dies but not everyone who dies lives" "If I could give u one thing in life, it would be the ability to see yourself as  others see u, then u would realize what a truly special person u are..."  "People don't act stupid... it's the real thing" "I hope your life is like toilet paper... long and useful" "Nobody said it was easy."   "More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones." L|I|F|E my anti-drug.  Straight Pride  If a guy can't respect me enough to wait until marriage, then I can't trust him enough to have sex with him.  I act like shit don't phase me Inside it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby Suddenly I'm not crazy...    Then in violent, frustration He cries out to God or just no one Is there a point to this madness and all that he was..is just a tragedy.  I went into the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life ... to put to rout all that was not life; and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.   Nothing you love is ever lost...not really...things, people...they all go away sooner or later. You can't hold onto them anymore they you can hold moonlight but if they've touched you, if they're inside you then they're still yours. The only things you ever really have are the you hold inside your heart  ...everything I know about breaking hearts I learned from you...   x Buried Alive By Love x  I am the cause to all ur problems  I died in my dreams, reaching out for your hand, my fatal desire  You may shoot me with your words,You may cut me with your eyes,You may kill me with your hatefullness, But still, like air, I'll rise

      Sometimes I feel | Like I don't have a partner | Sometimes I feel | Like my only friend | Is the city I live in | The city of Angels | Lonely as I am | Together we cry ||| I drive on her streets | 'Cause she's my companion | I walk through her hills | 'Cause she knows who I am | She sees my good deeds | And she kisses me windy | I never worry | Now that is a lie   You're like a dictionary, you add meaning to my life!   Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way to trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way and youll be there if she ever feels blue and youll be there when she finds someone new what to do well you know You keep her in your pocket where theres no way out now put it in the safe and lock it cause its home sweet home  The sword of time will pierce our skins,  It doesn't hurt when it begins, But as it works it's way on in,  The pain grows stronger , watch it grin  how can i stand here with you  and not be moved by you?  would you tell me  how could it be  any better than this?  __________________ ¯ happiness coming and going i watch you look at me watch my fever growing i know  just where i am¯

       It could all be so simple, But you'd rather make it hard. Loving you is like a battle, And we both end up with scars. Tell me who i have to be, To get some reciprocity. See no one loves you more than me. And no one ever will.

       I still remember a year ago, The times we spent I think that I'm happier now. Up from the down. By all means, It's strange cause I feel the same way... It's cold in this town. And there's snow on the ground. Far from home, Not aloneI left you with nothing, And that's what you own..
