      So, today is the day she was supposed to leave for China. The time that she was supposed to leave/arrive was around 8:35am EST.    A new voicemail message has been found, listened to, and recorded, also. That recording can be found  urlLink here .    Now, if you listen to the message closely, she speaks of how she's going away, and says goodbye to her mother. Why doesn't she say goodbye to her aunt, Margaret? I've been speculating since the beginning that Chloe isn't Dana's mother, but that Margaret is. I know Chloe and Dana share a resemblance, but Margaret may not have been able to carry a child, and Chloe carried it for her. So, it's possible that she's saying goodbye to Margaret and not Chloe.    Back to the message, it basically says "Hi, this is Dana.  I'm going away.  Far away, and for a long time.  Leave a message, although I don't know when I'll get it.  Mom, I know you're calling just to hear the sound of my voice.  I love you too." and then proceeds to a Chinese/Mandarin part of speech that says "I'm not coming back. I'm sorry."

      I'm not sure what it means, but most people are thinking of it as a farewell expression. I want to know  exactly  what it means. If you know, add a comment.

         The images have been found of Dana's attention switching from something we don't know, to a device that is taking pictures of her.               I'm confused as to how this device caught Dana's attention...               Speculation says that it's obvious it's a webcam, and the AI that's running this show has taken pictures of her, labeled them as "killer" and uploaded them to the ilovebees.com website as an image in a 404 error page. The timeline of images (supposedly) goes like this:           [spacing so this post doesn't interfere with the right side of the page]                                        Seemingly calm, doing something, oblivious to this device taking images of her.                               Still calm, doing what she's been doing.                               Suddenly, her expression changes and she glances at the device.                               Fixing her glasses to get a better look at it. She's probably thinking about ilovebees.com right now, and something is going on with this device. (Something is casting a white reflection in her left lens. It might be the right if the device flips the images horizontally after it takes them.)         Update: I looked over the images again, and I've concluded that the white reflection is cause by a glare under her eye. Nothing strange about that.       Update 2: I've pointed out that the image moves slightly to the left between the above and below pictures. Some people are saying that because her right arm was moved up to her glasses, the webcam might have a motion tracker, and moved along with the motion of her arm. But, in the next image, if her right arm was already up, and she then raised her left arm, the camera should've shifted back to the right.                                  Raising her glasses and moving in on the device.                               Getting closer... (Even though in this last image she seems to be raises the glasses up to her forehead, in the next, it seems she has taken them off.)                               ...and closer, until she is right up with the cam.                               Since the picture is blurred a bit, it leads me to think she quickly backed away, realizing something was wrong.                               Now she's studying the device...                               Probably realizing something is up with it, she handles the device with her left arm and hand and moves it to the right. (I could be wrong if the device flips the image horizontally after it takes it.)                               She has a different expression now, and the device is being moved quickly, hence the blur. (Also, where is she looking?)                               It's most likely falling to where the next image shows...                               ...the floor. Now, she couldn't have done this because she noticed the device had been putting images of her on the site. The images were taken as she realized something was wrong.               The only way the device could've grabbed her attention is if it has some kind of light. If it was a webcam, this is a sure possibility, but not all webcams have lights. It could've been a digital camera, and the snapping of the photos (no flash, or Dana's face would've been much brighter and something would've reflected in her lenses) would've caught her attention.               I guess I'm really going into detail.    Note: None of what I said could be relevant to the game, but it's all worth noting.
