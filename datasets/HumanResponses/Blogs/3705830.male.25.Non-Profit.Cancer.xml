      i was a weedy child. this wasn't so much an accident of physiology, more an unnecessary attempt by the world to fully cast me in the role of maths geek. of course, at that age i wasn't of a mind to worry; but eventually i decided that i was hideous. there is one particular family holiday where all the photos have me hiding in the shadows, for fear of nothing less than being seen.  and then i grew up a little; and found out that whilst i would never be very well built, so to speak, i had quietly grown to a respectable height amongst my peers. i started putting more stock not in how i looked but how i carried myself; i started losing my clumsiness. and now whilst i'm still not much to look at, my body ususlly does what i ask of it, what i need it to.  i got comfortable with myself, i accepted what i was never going to be. although i could never be a nudist, and for two very good reasons: i) the cold, and ii) my need for pockets.  and did i mention, the cold?  i generally have lots of things in my pockets; i find it is one of the better things about men's clothes: there is no 'line' to ruin, as such. so i feel if naturism was to become compulsory, i'd need some sort of utility belt. and a nipple piercing to stop me losing my keys, obviously, but firstly a utility belt. being naked is no excuse for not having a grappling hook handy...   man, i'm tired.   n.

      i have developed a pain in my chest that is quite worrying; whether it has arisen from an almost entirely carbohydrate-based diet or from over-stretching during an impromptu kata is unclear; the fact that it is making it harder to sleep is undeniable. although certain claims on my snoring would seem to indicate otherwise. add to this the effects of returning to training after an extended bout of laziness, and we have a recipe for why i am only just surfacing now to eat the chocolate muffin left for me.  i hope the pain goes away; being the paranoid type is never easy at these times. also in light of the amount of dwontime i've been having; its a medical observation that the longer you stay in bed past the 'normal' eight hours or so, the greater your chances of having a stroke....  well, i think its funny.   almost five months to the day of living here, i realise i do not own a can-opener. this can be interpreted as a good sign (i don't live off canned food), or a bad sign (i live on toast; toast doesn't come in cans). ah well.   plans for today: call evil car hire firm call non-evil laura eat non-evil food pay evil credit card bill maybe even go outside   the world is my (non-evil) lobster.  n.

      i have been given a book to read, one that will 'change the way i think'. praise indeed; although i find that expectation often leads to a greater chance of disappointment. the inscription, however, is touching:  "neil, never forget just how awesome you are!"   some days i don't feel so awesome.   after drinking a mixture of lagers and the sweet tonic of white russian, the idea of toast is more appealing than during everyday life. and yet the night was set to get so much better than that: buttered toast.... and gravy. don't take my word for it; go and try it yourself! inebriation optional. we had to go to the shops for more bread because we ran out. more evidence that making do with what you have is more than just a way of living; it is essential for progress.   the sun has temporarily graced us with its return, and the free-flowing air of outside this room is calling. also, i have a friend who (i suspect) may need help eating that tub of ice cream...   hugs: squizzer toast and gravy gargantuan paul the postal service  slaps: hay fever   n.

      (it is never good to start on a digression. however)  a digression: you know those conversations that go something along these lines?  -you're in a weird mood. -no i'm not. -yes you are, what's wrong? -i'm not in a weird mood! -don't shout at me!   i hate those.   so, to the point: patriotism. in specific reference to the england football team being knocked out of [whatever tournament it is that's on at the moment] this evening. it was an exciting match, but i'm glad that england lost. note i didn't say 'we'. and why? because those eleven men playing football out there aren't doing it for me; they don't know me, i don't know them, i didn't ask them to play football for me. in no way do they represent me, and certainly not as a result of them being from the same country as me.  ergh. but i mustn't go on so. calm down.   blogger food of the day: uncle ben's express rice. genius! it comes in a packet that stands up in your microwave, it takes two minutes, you don't have to refrigerate it, and its quite tasty. especially at one in the morning when you're all toasted out.   hugs: alex and her talk of bra shopping uncle ben's express rice staplers (a bit random, i know, but they are cool, aren't they?) 'space raiders' crisps - ten pence? bargain! the manchester cow parade   slaps: indigestion from eating toast and rice too quickly   (sheesh...)  and no, i'm *not* in a mood...  n.

      is getting up at five in the afternoon more acceptable if you went to bed at five in the morning? i hope so. the good thing about midsummer away from the equator is that the sky never really gets very dark, especially in the sodium orange pool of greater manchester. overcast, but never truly black.  honesty breeds clarity; and some fairly frank discussions of ongoing problems [financial, motivational, female] leads simon to remark how happy he is to see 'how far i have come off the rails'. hmmm. i live to please.  note 1: red wine consumption leads to hangovers. note 2: do not mix red wine with pimm's. note 3: or whisky. note 4: even if these are all you have. note 5: do not serve pimm's by the pint.   the discussion of kung fu techniques that interlaced our drinking was quite illuminating; how shotokan karate shares similar traits with shaolin (not counter-intuitive, but enlightening to actually see in practice), and how multiple punch/block techniques are somewhat pointless. comparison of fighting distances reveals differences in philosophy.  note 6: fairy lights look good on yucca plants.   simon's plans to improve society are simple but ambitious: to take over the world as supreme dictator. he is currently looking for a hollowed-out volcano as a base for his evil empire, but no luck so far. as far as volcanos go, its just not geared up to the first time evil buyer. i mean, just graduated from evil university with all those evil student loans? its a bugger.  note 7: its a bugger.   good luck to squizzer, and to the barmypharmie for their pre-reg exams tomorrow.   initial shopping list: flora milk bread  other factors to consider: its, like, *so* raining, and, like, whatever.  revised shopping list:   (looks like popcorn for tea again)  n.

      in a moment of clarity i looked up the tablature for 'tightrope', by the stone roses. a truly beautiful wonderful song, and one that i have every intention of playing at some point when the mysterious 'band' gets together. acoustic singalongs were never so cool:  are we etched in stone,  or just scratched in the sand waiting for the waves to come  and reclaim the land?   and then, in a moment of complete insanity, i looked up the tablature for 'good times', by the stone roses. why? delusions of adequacy, and nothing more. oh my good god, there is no way i will ever ever learn to play that. [aside: i probably could, but it would need to be a full-time job and i'm fairly sure no-one's going to pay me for that, alas.] i get as far as 0:26 and then its into the main riff and i've no space to fit all those notes in.   it brings up the issue of 'the second coming', though, which is a vastly underrated album in my opinion. to have those two completely different songs next to each other and to have it work is an indication of something, even if five years is a long time to wait. definitely worth having; good summer guitar tunes. disregarding the rain, that is.   interesting fact: on the set of '24 hour party people', i met the fake john squire - that is, the actor playing john squire in the film. and yet, he doesn't appear in the film at all. shame; he had good john squire hair. presumably left on the cutting room floor...  n.

      an incident yesterday when a girl i was talking to on messenger clicked 'accept' for webcam feed before realising that she wasn't actually wearing a top. her modesty (and my fun) was saved by an uncompromising norton pop-up that has increasingly more to answer for. ah well.   the rain is as insistent as it is unwelcome, not to mention inappropriate for this time of year. good weather for the following:  hot chocolate writing songs staying inside shaving   okay, not shaving, but i do need to. also washing; where do all my pants go? it's a mystery.   as this blog unfolds i'm sure my master plans (plural; what master plan would be complete without at least one foolproof contingency?) will become clear, but for now i must go and busy myself with the ongoing preliminary stages. that is, maybe have a biscuit and watch the tv for a while.  hugs: themadnesshamster  more to follow.  n.

      whatever it is they put into freeze pops to make them those colours, there should be some sort of warning: may make your life a bit bizarre. and whilst giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post.  lucky we did.  who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? not i, for certain. i list but a few:  buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue. buy 600 plastic wallets, get a crate of diet coke. buy 3 boxes of pilot hi-techpont pens, get an inflatable basketball set. buy 4 boxes of manila envelopes, get a gazebo.   a gazebo?   the message here is clear: forget what you think you know, the world is far weirder than you thought. especially in the realm of office supplies.  n.

      five in the afternoon is not a good time to be eating breakfast. that there is something wrong is not in question; what exactly that is is proving elusive. i'm fairly sure i wouldn't mind so much if my dreams were anything to write about, but they are mostly fairly horrible and occasionally, as was the case just now, end on a musical number featuring julie walters.  further involvement with local politics - the disassembling and analysis of a certain incident of assault - has strengthened my conviction that people can 'knob off'; that is to say that being emotional has never been an excuse for being wrong. of course, the real crux of the issue is that one week after passing my second dan i missed the only real fight that's ever happened here. ah well.   this blog is off to an interesting start; much more than the previous journal this is shaping up to be 'open', so much so that i may even tell people about it. radical, eh?   hugs: the most important meal of the day lelia varieties of shower gel '1 comments' an absence of spam soluble coffee  slaps: the need for washing the rolling on of days i don't like its raining some pieces [don't fit together]   n.

      hiya,  i have some observations i'd like to share; like how sometimes it seems easier to go out of your way for people you don't know, and how once you start ignoring the 'phone it becomes easier and easier not to ever pick it up.  in recent stealth missions i acquired a popcorn maker; a neat little device that is essentially a hair-drier with a funnel attached. the heat makes the air difficult to breathe in but the snacks are worth it, especially now with my newly-acquired bottle of maple syrup. keep refrigerated once opened.  i hope some people have found me from my previous life; yes it's the same nmrboy that fled the collapse and resultant politics of [that] journal site. i hate politics. it seems that only those people that should never get into positions of power are the ones who want to run for election.  other recent acquisitions:  clothes horse fairy lights fairy liquid handwash microwave rice fruit bowl other types of bowl (not for fruit) cutlery desk lamp television table tea bags (240) coffee (5 jars) double lollies  etc etc. let's hear it for 'pre-emptive recycling'; being a womble was never so much fun as when the undergraduates leave their halls of residence and decide they're too lazy to take everything with them.   a gift today in the post; some cds and a charming card from a friend who recently stayed with me. a delightful girl whom i only met last sunday, but she needed a place to stay and what the heck! what i lack in judgement of character i make up in hope that, deep down, people are nice.  how foolish! and so to bed.  n.

      &nbsp;  but solitaire is a lonely man's game.  &nbsp; abstraction is a wonderful skill; it not only allows me to separate my higher functions and so see myself as 'i' (the notation becomes tricky) see other people, but also allows me to effectively ignore the world.  &nbsp; other theories and observations that i intend to share are mainly statistical in nature; i am forever intrigued at the difference between the individual case and the ensemble outlook. so much of the world is chaotic; and yet the word itself defines the world as completely and rigorously deterministic. but even this is statistical; the macroscopic newtonian world is merely an ensemble of the quantum level, where chaos is replaced by true uncertainty.  and yet things fall downwards; and they always will. bizarre.  &nbsp; i am fascinated by the notion of bringing order from disorder; matt ridley is keen to point out that humans (and living creatures&nbsp;in general) are merely localised anomalies of order in a world overrun by entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics.  i am reminded of the startling man lennart green, a card magician extraordinaire. this is a man that can have a deck of cards shuffled, and will then restore the entire order (suits and values) without you noticing. it is astounding; i saw him do it at a lecture once, and i was impressed. i learned the theory of how to do it; i was more impressed.  this brings me to my favourite current way of wasting time: spider solitaire. here we have an unending supply of disorder, waiting to be ordered. and when you win, you click 'yes' and there are yet more cards to sort. lucky i'm not the obsessive type, eh?  (bugger)  &nbsp; still, the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring. it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved. this generally comes from experience - learning to 'see' by interpreting repeating patterns of light as 'objects', for example - and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern. if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything, but only&nbsp;in terms of what we already knew. if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything, but with nothing in relation to anything else. the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new:  what of this have i felt before? what of this have i never felt before?  &nbsp; i am rambling. i shall leave you with a list, and then be off to play solitaire.  staples in my stapler: 1 pictures of alex on my wall: 2 pieces my sunglasses are currently in: 4 pills left: 5 pictures of dido visible from where i am sat: 7 balloons on my desk: 12  n.

      &nbsp; in my head, and in response to an email i received discussing the separation of beauty and personality, i have compiled a top five list of girls i have been most attracted to. this list was much harder to make, and i'm still only up to four. at present,&nbsp;and in alphabetical order, it runs:  ceri charlotte chloe helen  &nbsp; the crucial point, though, is that none of the previous list appear here. the above were all girls i have been lucky enough to get to know well, whereas the previous list is made up more of acquaintances (exceptions are my sister and caroline). i leave you to make your own conclusion: do the above people appear more attractive because i know them well, or&nbsp;did i get to know them well because i firstly found them attractive? do the two go hand in hand because you will get to know people more if their personality fits yours, and thus you will also tend to find them more attractive?  disclaimer: i have no intention of upsetting anyone! i would be the first to concede that my opinions on many things are a little skewed; and i would urge anyone to remember that my notion of attractiveness is often in direct conflict with other people's. there is precisely no worldly advantage in being found attractive by me, unless you&nbsp;find&nbsp;me attractive in return. and how often does that happen?  &nbsp; so anyway; today's scheduled laundry was postponed for the duration of 'the magnificent seven', a wonderful film that i force on unsuspecting people from time to time. whilst it will cast me out of certain circles i will have to confess to never having seen 'the seven samurai', although i do like the kurosawa i have seen. my favourite quote from the film is yul brynner's response to the idea that farmers tell their women that the gunslingers will rape them:  'well, we might. in my opinion, though, you could have given us the benefit of the doubt.'  the dialogue throughout the film is brilliantly measured; i should like to write characters like that. maybe one day&nbsp;i shall.  &nbsp;  ongoing arguments with my mother struggle to keep within the boudaries of reason; she avoids the issue of whether she believes me (essentially anything i say, ever) despite my asking the question directly at least four times. i know the answer is no from everything else she says, but i still want to hear her say it. i can disprove all of her assumptions but she does not care for that. and in line with all the things my therapy is uncovering she demands of me that i suppress my own character. i have no desire to do that; maybe when i was young, but no more. when she starting telling me i didn't care i&nbsp;undoubtedly did, but these days my answer is tempered by the turbulence in my own mind over who i actually am. personality conflicts with conditioning; and the problem lies in that whatever shaped me has made me into someone who needs to question the validity of those implemented ideals. i cannot respect you if you lie to me, and i cannot trust you if you yourself do not recognise that you lie.  like i say, ongoing issues. but apparently they aren't important.  &nbsp; i should also like to apologise to anyone who overheard my attempt at playing the piano this evening. 'a long december' never sounded so long, i'm sure...  n.

      &nbsp;  aside: you know you've done well with your lunch when the stacked sandwiches are as tall as they are wide...  as i sit planning - yes, planning - what to write i am torn as to what my actual aim is; if i am diverting then that is more than good enough, but surely i have something more to share? to this end i will attempt, from time to time,&nbsp;to expound on some of the theories i have formed about how things work. if nothing else, it will be a useful insight to the way my mind works, and how i perceive the world.  the first that comes to mind is 'leapfrogging buses', or 'how to not get infuriated on your way home'. more on that in&nbsp;a minute.  &nbsp; hold your thumb and first finger out, very close together. now, without them touching, try to move them closer. closer still. yes? now, that is how close i was to buying a polaroid instamatic camera on thursday. i saw one (two, actually, but one appeared to date from the paeleolithic era and wouldn't have looked out of place with a pin-hole) in a charity shop, and spent a good five minutes toying with the idea. i've always wanted one, that i can remember; something about the self-containment appeals to me. but i didn't buy it in the end out of respect for my ever-dire financial situation (camera = cheap; film = expensive) and also the thought that i may be mistaken for someone taking 'candid' (nudge nudge, wink wink, say no more squire) photos at home. a label i wouldn't mind so much if it was a remote possibility, but sadly not.  today's list is of things that are not really fruit but can be classed as one of the day's five portions since they are healthy: a glass of milk vitamin supplement pill opening a window taking the stairs thinking about having some fruit  its true; you know it is.  &nbsp;   leapfrogging buses: a theory.  more of an observation, really.  some simplifying assumptions:  i) all buses travel the same route, at the same driving speed. ii) all passengers are travelling to the end of the line.  iii) all distributions are normal. iv) there are no price/ticket considerations in choosing buses. v) all stops are the same duration.  (these&nbsp;will be dismissed in turn, but to illustrate the idea i've&nbsp;started it as simple as possible)  imagine there are people waiting for the bus at every stop. one bus travelling the route will stop at every stop to pick people up, and take a certain amount of time to do the run.   this is obvious; but more interesting is if there are two buses travelling next to each other. assuming i) to be valid (as is the case on my way to/from work), people will signal for the first bus, which will stop. assuming ii) to be valid, the second bus will not stop and will overtake the first. the buses have now swapped positions, and will 'leapfrog' each other down the route, stopping at  every other  stop and thus&nbsp;completing the run&nbsp;faster.  however, buses tend not to set off together; it makes no business sense. but, if iii) is valid then there will be a statistical variation on the number of people waiting for the bus at any stop at any time. in truth, the variation is not truly random but follows a certain pattern (rush hour, etc) with  an amount  of variation built-in. and if there is a variation, then we can say that v) is not valid.&nbsp;so; if we are to imagine there is, at a certain stop at a certain time, significantly more people than the mean number of people at any stop at any time(which is statistically very likely) then the solitary bus will be signalled and will have a long stop for everyone to board. this will delay that particular bus, and the next bus along the route will gain some time on it. a feedback loop is created: the first bus is taking longer to do the run since its stops are longer, this leads to a greater build-up of people at the following stops and will cause  those  stops to be longer also. the second bus may not encounter the same heavy numbers of passengers, and so will gain on the first bus, moreso as the first bus is continuing to make longer and longer stops. eventually, the second bus will catch up, and the two will begin to leapfrog.  &nbsp; so we have leapfrogging buses; if these are running faster than a single bus would, then it is conceivable, is it not, that the two would eventually catch up with any single bus ahead on the same route? bingo! three buses in a row.  assumption iv) need not be discussed heavily since people will either simply signal the first bus that comes along (which is statistically more likely to be a 'first' bus of a pre-leapfrogging pair), thus not affecting the leapfrogging behaviour,&nbsp;or will have a ticket for a certain bus&nbsp;company, which modifies the idea from being 'any bus' to 'buses of a certain company', treating each company separately.  whilst assumption ii) is not valid in the general case, it does not affect the behaviour  in the long run . also required is the possibility of there being no people waiting at the stop; all the possibilities of first bus/second bus stopping are thus:  yes/yes: no distance/order change between buses yes/no : decrease in distance between buses, possible leapfrogging no/yes: increase in distance between buses, no leapfrogging no/no:&nbsp;&nbsp;no distance/order change between buses  if all these occur randomly then their overall effect is that described earlier, to promote leapfrogging.  &nbsp;  and there we have it; my idea as to why (particularly at peak times where it is more likely that there are people at each stop) buses can bunch up in twos and threes. i have no idea if this has been postulated anywhere else; i certainly haven't looked for it. but do let me know what you think, or if i don't make sense somewhere, which is quite likely.  anyhow, i'm making chop suey. excuse me.  n.

      &nbsp;  i leave the room for ten minutes, and when i come back the radio is playing 'club tropicana'. this sort of behavior must not be tolerated; i have urgently restored 'hate', by the delgados, to the cd player. hopefully the day can yet be recovered.  &nbsp; the train company wrote to me again;they say they're very sorry my train was late setting off, late arriving, and was without lighting and heating for about a third of the journey. here, have three pounds.  the thing that gets me is that they're not even doing it deliberately to make me laugh; they're actually serious. if i only had a car. oh, wait, i  do  have a car. i just can't afford the insurance. and why? because its about three times as much as the car is worth. without any no-claims bonuses, i can't afford the first year premiums, and thus will never get any no-claims bonuses. grr.  and here's the thing: if you  are  insured, and you have a crash, they put your premiums up! its like they're saying "ah, yes, well we didn't think you'd actually  crash . we were just taking money off you; if you want to  crash  then that'll be extra."  &nbsp; from the bus today i saw anna; i was tempted to get off and run back to talk to her but i figured my life has enough complications, and anyway last time i saw her about three weeks ago we were on the same bus and i saw her and i think she saw me, but either she didn't recognise me or wanted to appear as if she didn't. i'm putting it down to my then outrageous hair; i have too many issues to explore the more likely scenarios.  &nbsp; the five prettiest girls i have ever known (in some sort of particular order): my sister on her wedding day pink laura clare slater anna ball caroline rogers  i make no claims on personality or overall attractiveness; just prettiness. it is worth noting that i have only been out with one of them (caroline, before anyone starts), and that whilst at one point i may have ended up sharing a house with laura i never actually knew her surname. it is also worth noting that they are all very lovely people, easy to get on with, and intelligent. i guess this goes to underline that it's nigh impossible to truly separate personality and prettiness. yes...  &nbsp; (and also:&nbsp;naomi tan almost made the list. just so you know. i'm sure she's gutted.)  &nbsp; man, the delgados rule.  n.  &nbsp;

      i love the british railway system; who else would write to you to let you know they are going to write to you? maybe i should write back: dear sir; thank you for your letter warning me of your impending letter; i was, however, startled to receive said advance letter without prior notice...   i ask for the complaint forms with the tickets these days; it saves time. although maybe i'm just bitter that soon i won't be considered a 'young person', and will have to forge my railcard. is it just me or is there no way&nbsp;anyone in their right mind would&nbsp;ever consider&nbsp;paying the 'full' fare? i'd want a piece of the train for that amount; the seat at least. or a section of brake cable. yeah, that'd be cool. sittin' at home, me and my brake cable...   &nbsp;  anyway. also continuing to amuse me are the details on the back of some of my calvin and hobbes books: "not for sale in the usa or canada. humour". although my general intolerance of all but a few americans has been piqued recently with the arrival of 400 of their footballing children. not that i blame them for their general rudeness and arrogance  per se ; when you talk to [most of] their coaches you can see where they are taking their example from.   &nbsp;  ah well. in other news, the pancakes of last night went very well, on account of good company, vanilla ice-cream and fair lashings of maple syrup. in my general non-presence of mind i neglected to buy the crate of beer i'd decided was essential, and had to fill the void with blue aftershock, which is, according to the prophecy, foul. but never mind; i can't help but think how the conversation may have turned to tripe otherwise, and i may never have postulated that the consistency of calamari lends itself to being a useful emergency scrunchy.   &nbsp;  my woody allen cd has arrived! and has much funniness contained; it still sounds fresh despite being recorded forty years ago. i find that people treat woody allen in the same way as karate (bear with me on this one); they seem to have formed an opinion without having actually sampled any first hand. and so my mission shall be to play woody allen to all my friends, and if they don't like it i'll kick them in the face. harsh, but fair.   &nbsp;  things i know a fair amount about but have never really actually properly seen:  quantum dynamics  weezer  my mind  the postal system  spike milligan   &nbsp;  i have recently moved onto the next jar of 'liberated' coffee. i am reminded of  urlLink simon , who used to be able to tell (i imagine he still can) what brand of coffee you gave him, with what milk and what type of sugar/sweetener. he didn't get out much.   &nbsp;  n.

         &nbsp;  i am wondering whether the inclusion of links to stuff would enhance or detract from this blog; that was one of the problems with my old journal. people started getting clever, and being clever is the original double-edged sword. given the choice between being a popular jumping-off point or an obscure idiosyncratic, i choose the latter. i always have. mind you, that's not to say you can't combine the two; i direct you to   urlLink  greg   &nbsp;both as a good example of such, and as a hat-tipping to the guy who got me started here.     &nbsp;

      let me introduce you to a place i've heard of; a place that does not exist. here, the rules of causality can be circumvented. consequence still follows action, but is no longer inextricably linked; the two can be separated. we can pay for our mistakes at our convenience, so as not to cause unnecessary suffering. imagine.  i was first introduced to this place by a dear friend of mine, who uses a love story as illustration. i keep the details deliberately vague. a boy has been with a girl for many years, and meets another girl whilst living abroad and falls in love. but it is an unknown love; the love of a few months knowing someone. and the question becomes is the chance of this one new person being the 'one' (if there is such a thing; statistics dictate otherwise, but hey) worth the irrepairable damage that will undoubtedly happen to the existing relationship? his answer, as i think most people's would be, was no.  but wouldn't you like to know? have the freedom to explore that possibility without having to hurt anyone? this is possible here. your mistakes are yours to make, and they will not inadvertantly destroy anyone else's happiness. like so many things; it probably wouldn't work, but its a nice thought experiment.    on conditional love: i can't really be doing with it. i think i should rather be loved because i have earned that love; because i am worth being loved. my body and mind are a statistical genetic result, and as such it is an accident that i am 'me'. any number of different people could have resulted. even if conception is deliberate (as is not often the case), then to be 'contractually obliged' as a parent to love the offspring regardless of their character is absolving the child of the responsibility to try to be a decent person, and absolving the parents of the responsibility to try and raise the child to be so. a responsibility i believe everyone should have: to try, at least. it is my noblest and most human characteristic that i do not consider myself to be 'enough', this is the only thing that ever pushes me to be more than i was, than i am.   n.

      there is a sign in the window of the local hairdressers that says 'models required'. firstly, it occurred to me to respond to the advert; surely there is money to be made for a young lad with a passable face and a willingness to submit his hair to the whim of fashion? and then secondly, i had a much better idea: i shall hang my own of these notices in my window, and see what comes of it. models wanted.   actually, it isn't true. i am so much more content with real people, capable of conversing and, where necessary, cutting me down. girls with charm are welcome, models need not apply. i just liked the thought of it, that's all.  i am watching films recommended to me by my therapist. i am intrigued to know what his aim is, and what my reaction will be.   a historical note: 'interesting' was the last word i ever said to charlotte. i do not recall who hung up immediately after.  even as i lay dying i am certain the experience will fascinate me. my epitaph, already planned (and which i fully allow anyone to use, if they wish), will read: 'that was interesting'.   in my lifei have been guilty of many things, and innocent of many also. my wonder at the world is matched easily by my cynicism, and yet the one ever-persistent feature is fascination with the sensation of living. it is fair to say i have never felt anything like it. recently spending time with ceri reminds me of the fervour with which she embraces life, and the way with her i couldn't help but do the same. i try to remember that when the time requires it.   a downbeat post; my apologies. and it started so well. i often find that this is the way things happen. although, to be fair, often the other way too. how interesting.

      seriously. don't get me started.  seriously.   well look, it's like this. i find haircuts traumatic; possibly moreso than most things in my life. if that sounds odd, consider this. i have never - ever - in my life received a haircut that i was happy with. content, even. not one. ever. i am twenty five; having been alive for a quarter of a century, how many haircuts do you suppose i have had? how many have you had? i haven't liked a single one of them. not one.   let me elaborate. haircuts are traumatic before you get anywhere near the hairdressers; it begins with people starting to tell you to get your hair cut, or more likely just making snide comments at the expansiveness of your mane. so then you decide to get it cut, and things get serious. what cut do you want? how do you want to appear to the rest of the world? i hate the idea of stepping out of the shop and declaring 'yes, i paid money to look this specific way'. and why do i hate that idea? i pay money to dress the way i do, to go the places i do, so what's the difference? ah, good question, and the answer is one of life's little secrets: hairdressers never do what you ask them to. they only ever do *what they were going to anyway*. it makes no matter what you say to them, you will only ever leave the shop when *they* are happy that you look like they want you to. we are helpless; once our hair is cut from our heads gravity takes over, and we never get it back. we are at the mercy of the hairdresser; someone, you'll note, who invariably has hair that you personally wouldn't be seen dead with. strange, that, eh? yes its true, whatever you ask for you're leaving looking 'trendy'.  or even worse, as happened to me last time: having an interview the next day i asked to look 'sensible'. i actually came out looking 'like i was in the marines'. tossers. (hairdressers, not the marines...)   and then, of course, we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking 'oh, yes, that's fine, thank you' when asked if the cut is alright. and then: we *pay* them, when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork. grrrr.   is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair, they just keep going well past the point they should stop? when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off, and then they generally confirm by doing the hair-through-the-fingers thing. i become optimistic; they have obviously understood. so then they cut the right amount off all over my head, and i am content. and then, for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves, they *do it all again*. and again.   i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers. i sit there as they cut, and with every snip i can't help but think 'well, there goes another four weeks dedicated hair-growing'. and then i leave, and my neck gets cold. i hate it so much.   when i graduated, i paid a lot of money for a 'special graduation haircut', my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity. i went to town (literally, not figuratively, although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere). i made an appointment. i paid double the price i would normally expect.  i hated it. i could have saved the extra money; i could have bought a pizza. sheesh.   even talking about it makes me sad and angry. maybe i should refuse to pay. maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want, and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short. they always cut my hair too short. maybe i should stop them half way through.  i knew i should have cut it myself. i knew it i knew it i knew it.   i hate the hairdressers. i really do.

      (more of these as i think of them)  i) have a shower really late at night, wash your hair. ii) whilst your hair is wet, create an unusual/daring style. iii) do not dry your hair. iv) go immediately to bed.  guaranteed to add a little spice to your life.   happy birthday to me. thanks to people who have sent their regards. in a frenzy (albeit it a decidedly lethargic one) of online decadence and visits to charity shops i am now the proud owner of:  ash - meltdown the charlatans - up at the lake woody allen - stand up comic red hot chili peppers - californication s club 7 - sunshine host - feel cheap/letter x  huzzah! and yet there is a warning in today; feeling happy this morning i forgot to take the pill (obviously, not 'the pill', but 'the pill [i am supposed to take]'. sheesh).  n.

      and then you keep waiting. of the two main bus companies that operate the route i use, i recently changed allegiances on the grounds of a cheaper weekly ticket and the observation that there seems to be more of that type of bus. and now i have changed? i am beginning to notice that the relative numbers of buses has radically changed. today i watched four buses of the other company roll past, and then on another occasion three, before one i could use came by. but the real killer? coming back from my old flat today, a total of nine (count 'em! nine) buses came past* before one i could use.  but it was sunny, and i was in no hurry to get to the lab....   a time-differential theory of beauty: i will only decide whether someone is attractive once i have seen how they move.   question: why does the graduate recruitment bureau send me emails exclusively in the middle of the night? is the careers office staffed by vampires? or worse, accountants?   tidying my desk at work in the next stage in my master plan ('get a phd you stupid git'); removing all those silly things i'd accumulated that wasted the space on my shelves, space that will be necessary for organising things like references and notebooks and spectra and things-that-i-don't-know-what-they-are-but-i-figure-i'd-better-not-throw-them-away-in-case-they-turn-out-to-be-important. a list of things i brought home today, then: picture frame (empty) box of diskettes (including the soft copy of my play, and xenon 2) stuffed 'the brain' toy payslip (october '03) calvin and hobbes book photo album (empty) postcards (including one of paris, one of spiderman) shotokan kata book modelling balloons (half packet) sunglasses (not trendy)   delving into my finances reveals that barclaycard are not evil, my apologies barclaycard. i shall feed you hundreds of pounds forthwith.   is astroturf eaten by astrocows?  n.

      of all the foodstuffs not recommended for the just-before-bedtime slot, cheese with chilli sauce has probably got to feature somewhere near the top. and yet, i slept well enough not to remember my dreams. which might be a good thing seeing as they would likely have included ghost badgers and mott the hoople.  the new me has a newly tidy desk, it is a happy me that sits to write with a cup of herbal tea and mott the hoople.  i am hoping to receive notification today that barclaycard are evil, and that they owe me two hundred pounds. otherwise, buying food could be a problem. i am hoping to receive an apology and some freebies from ariel, since their washing tablets refuse to remove mud from my gi. i am also hoping to receive birthday cards that contain thousands of pounds, but i figure this is unlikely. i'll settle for love.   cds i need to buy: ash - meltdown red hot chili peppers - blood sugar sex magik jeff buckley - grace nick drake - five leaves left maroon 5 - songs about jane mercury rev - all is dream muse - absolution   and so many others, after looking at si's collection. damn those with disposable income.  food i went to buy yesterday: milk and bread actual cost of what i bought: £9.87  hmmm.  and onwards.  n.

      the loan adverts that are currently plaguing the television annoy me; i have begun to see the pattern they follow:  i) having trouble paying bills? ii) problems getting loans elsewhere? iii) reduce your monthly payments! iv) take your family on holiday, or buy a new kitchen! v) call now.   stripped down, this essentially becomes: having trouble coping? ignore it!  this is a strategy i am familiar with. the flaw is a basic one: if you're having trouble with bills and the such; stop taking loans out! loans = more to pay back. it has to; otherwise how does it work, and why are there so many companies offering it? the rationale is bizarre, and only works because of fear. this is, essentially, the hard sell, in our own homes. i don't want to play any more.   recent ringtones that surprised: scotland the brave.   time spent down in london village at the weekend have lent some direction to my current thoughts; advice and consultation with old and older friends is refreshing. i've needed to get out of this head for a while; fortunately, pimm's in the backyard sunshine are a good help to getting out of your head. the gathering became the party, the party became the barbecue, and the barbecue eventually gave way to an impromptu concert of irish folk and the schubert.   happy birthday, si.   which brings me to my own impending quarter century, which promises to bring with it nothing special. more age; i already have all i want. so far my years of adult life have offered no indication of a stable and/or happy life to come; i am no closer to a decision about what any of this means. i am continually grateful of those that have given me their time, but i am always scared they will (in the end) decide it wasn't worth it.  [insert oblique reference to failed relationships of the past]   more positive notes regard my apparent optimism in the face of the things that bring me down. i am recognising the patterns. there are always patterns. i no longer resent the light that brings the sun at its centre so maybe the drugs are working, and now it is time to ask myself to do the same.  n.

      if lack of sleep leads to an involuntary lowering of defences, then therapy this morning indirectly benefitted. i was (quote) more open (unquote) than i have ever been before; whether this is also related to the subject matter (relationships past) is open for further thought.  then to the charity shops, where i am dismayed to find oxfam is currently re-shelving its book section, but cheered to find the following tucked away in cancer research uk:  the illustrated woody allen reader - woody allen the essential difference - simon baron-cohen the meaning of it all - richard feynman   any of these, after paul auster, will be light relief. and then to the shops to spend another fortune on ready meals and oranges. food parcels gladly accepted as long as they contain no curry or citrus fruit. and to close, a note from today's horoscope: "if you want something, get out there and get your hands on it." you have been warned!  n.

      prozac does not work. go figure.   there have been incidents recently that have cheered me (you know who you are) and infuriated me (you know damn well who  you  are), but i can't help but wonder if that would have happened anyway. the worst is not really knowing; its been a few months now and i thought i had improved a little, but now i'm not so sure. if my mood is changeable anyway, then surely we need some sort of definite correlation between times of medication and times of better living? i'm a scientist, dammit; i need proof. i may ask to come off the pills at my next review; perhaps risky, but perhaps not. in my quieter moments i wonder what i have to lose.   this sounds terrible; and i must apologise to those who have recently made me so glad to be alive, and to those who will worry needlessly. but there have been certain words and actions, the effects of which i have understated, that have thrown me into confusion again. and worse, i am no longer sure of even recording these thoughts here for fear of the audience i have become aware of. a sad thing, to live in fear; to take another's game so seriously. i did what you asked, i would have hoped that would be enough.  i am curious to know what you were thinking, and i am almost sure i'm entitled to an explanation. i think i could maybe ask, but consider this: you so often have proved me wrong in what i think, the question regrettably becomes more complicated. you think i overreact; i am amazed i am so calm. if something doesn't matter to you then you must concede you are probably the poorer judge of how it should be handled?  the morning is well upon me. i think i will go and have a conversation with the memory of you before sleep and daylight successively save me.   n.

      i have cracked spider solitaire. last week i came up with a method of defeating it, and i haven't lost a game since. some are taking a long time and are decidely tricky, but i've completed every single one. now, everyone knows i normally only do the medium difficulty one, but today i tried a game on the hard setting. i completed it. convinced?  i guess the first thing to note is that unlike conventional solitaire,  every frame can be beaten . an obvious statement, perhaps, but important, i think. i developed the idea on the two-suit variety, and i haven't done it rigorously, but i hope you'll get the idea. general principles, then.   i) always keep a spare cell when you can. this is the most useful space since anything can be put there. always work to be making a new spare cell; the more the better.  ii) keep a track on colour (or suit) changes; the less, the better. always use a spare cell to swap out matching suits if you can. before a new row fill the spare cells to give lesser numbers of changes in the board.  iii) clean runs of the same suit can be treated as a single card; runs of different suits are therefore broken down into that many single cards.  iv) if you have many of one card value, then try to keep them exposed as little as possible by not moving non-running cards on top of them.  v) using two free spaces, simple runs of different suits can be moved using the  urlLink tower of hanoi  principle.  vi) completing a suit and removing it can never be a bad thing since it does not alter the ratio of unmatched 'useful' and 'unuseful' cards.  vii) stacking up suit-changing runs isn't a bad thing; it helps to free spare cells which are more useful in the end. it is common (on the medium setting) to be able to complete two suits before needing the first new row using this idea.   but, most importantly, and the key to the whole issue, is that  you have to remove the element of chance  from the game. if you rely on luck, there is a good chance you will be beaten. if you want to beat the game every time you have to sacrifice the honour of playing an honest game. (it is up to you whether you consider this worthwhile, or 'in the spirit of the game'; i started doing it to investigate whether each frame is possible. it is possible that each frame is possible in a number of ways, but i'm not sure how to show this). i call this 'the riley method'; and basically it means being ruthless, and  never  giving up. the key to this is the 'undo' function. if something doesn't look like its working out, go back. try something else. you can undo back to the last suit-removal or new row, and often you'll need to try a few different approaches. mostly, the objective is to complete another suit, but beware that this can scupper you if you've filled all the spare cells, so be careful.   overall, then, i can't say this will guarantee you success. i've been playing cards since i was little and i've built up a good understanding of cardplay, and i have a fairly mathematical brain to start with. but i thought i'd mention it; if only to explain what i've been doing with my time. i'd be interested to hear any comments anyone has; and again i haven't looked to see if anyone has written about this before, i prefer working the puzzle myself.   list of puzzles i that i looked up the answer for:  urlLink the morris sequence  (my favourite sequence puzzle ever)  urlLink rubik's clock  (well, lee dicks told me because he's an arrogant bastard but i'd showed no signs of getting the answer myself)  there are probably others.  n.

      an interesting weekend.  no, let me put it differently. a great weekend. an outstanding weekend. made so by the presence of a certain scouser that has been decidedly missing from my life of late. whilst the reunion wasn't everything i'd hoped for, i do concede that sometimes clothes  are  necessary...  a trip to liverpool brings back many memories, all of them good, and adds many more besides. promises to go again soon are much less than idle, i assure you. returning to manchester on saturday with alex in hand, so to speak, we are able to catch up on months of pointless chattering, which is always good. having to fulfil a promise i made a long time ago (under duress, i'm sure), i dug out the magic box and did some tricks; the reaction i got makes me wonder why i ever gave it up. well, maybe i didn't, really. just a change of emphasis. i couldn't help but be amused that the patter was all still there in my head; maybe my childhood wasn't so wasted after all. some of the shows we did! completely daft, but they've got to be some of my favourite times. those days we were indestructible; we could do anything, so we did. not such a bad way of living.  they say that you can have too much of a good thing, and the takeaway pizza almost had the better of me, but i outwitted it in the end. with the intention of getting horrendously drunk we then proceeded to get dressed for the night out; i put some shoes on, whilst maria and alex proceeded to try everything on twice, straighten their hair (i idly did a bit of my fringe but succeeded only in looking like i was from  urlLink franz ferdinand ), put contact lenses in, and lord knows what else (i wasn't allowed in the room, no matter how nicely i asked). turns out that the two of them are exactly the same size in clothes, which is both convenient and a little worrying. apparently they got ready in remarkably quick time. apparently.  any concerns i had about it getting too late for us to become entirely inebriated were soon put to rest with our arrival at  urlLink kro bar , where we swiftly ordered the strawberry beer we'd been looking forward to. finding ceri and some assorted chemists also at the bar was a bonus, and with the addition of gargantuan paul made a decent eight. and there we stayed until closing, whereupon we sauntered to the inestimably groovy big hands. ceri's admirable figure and sharp eyes getting us entry discount and a table respectively, it all worked out very well indeed. as we proceeded to drink and shoot the distinct lack of breeze, and on the promise of some frankly lewd behaviour (yet to materialise; i should have got it written down, dammit) i repeated the elastic band trick a couple of times. the principle of never repating a trick can be bent slightly with the addition of alcohol, i find. discussions of kung fu and swaying to the sounds of  urlLink manu chao  give way  to me being told that i am gay "because i know cat's cradle". hmmm, and you think they'd be impressed that you could do it with elastic bands. and so, into the night air, and bus rides addressing urgent questions: are we going to bed now, or are we not?  not. instead we are to go to maria's to collect wine (and for paul to steal stella from the fridge, leaving four pounds and the note 'have nicked your stella, buy yourself a palace') and to go 'ssssh!' very loudly, before back to mine to talk about... erm... well anyway, it was good.   sunday morning is true studenthood; a rota system was set up for maria, alex and i to use the shower, the single bowl, and single mug. the idea of simply sharing each one in turn was mooted; but optimism is a good thing, y'know? being thoroughly exhausted and all resting on the single bed together, the look on greg's face when he came to knock on the window was priceless. "this never happens in my room!" he says, mock-seriously. i feel no compulsion to explain the decidedly less exciting truth of the matter; i just smile and leave the illusion. that's showbiz.  n.

      well now. please excuse my absence, and also the fact that in the near future i may not be around so much. there was this thing, you see, and there was an issue, and so we all moved and we're not there any more. and i'm so tired of running around being responsible that i shan't say much more.  urlLink greg , less uprooted than myself, has written an account of the last couple of days. all i shall say is: no internet connection is losing, secretly stealing illegal mini-fridge for personal use is winning.  in other news i now have my mouse up and running, and it is lovely. i am also considering buying an inexpensive digital camera to supplement this here site with illustrations of exactly what the hell i'm talking about. you have been warned.   on monday night, as i lay awake before the onslaught of the day to come and during the onslaught of the rain which surely played its part, i got to thinking of a story from my past that i should like to share. the reason i thought of it was my (by now usual) insomnia, and all those fruitless efforts people make to try to sleep when their body (albeit ready to drop) is having none of it.  secondary school; before i gave up my childish dreams of doing something i wanted in life, i took a GCSE in drama. part of this course was taken by a large, somewhat sweaty man called george cockroft, who looked not a little like  urlLink john mccririck . which, thinking back, is a bit weird. i liked him a lot; he was an intelligent man who (for all i know on the subject) taught us well. but there is one lesson that still stays with me: in the drama studio (a big room that could be blacked out, essentially) one time he had the entire class of around twenty five lay flat on our backs, completely relaxed, whilst all the lights were turned out. and as we lasy there in the dark (the giggling subsided eventually) he began to talk to us, taking us through a systematic relaxation of our bodies. it was amazing; i think over half of us fell asleep, and the rest of us had never been so still. i still use the same technique today; and with discipline, it works.  at the end of the fifth year, when we had taken our exams and all was done, mr cockroft was leaving the school. and i remember one day (it may have been sports day), a beautifully sunny day, being outside on the field and having a brief talk with him. i imagine i said something like how much i'd enjoyed the drama course, and doing the plays, and the such. i imagine he said something like he was glad i'd enjoyed it, etc. and then i said something like "so, i'm not sure when i'll see you again", and i remember him looking at me in a mysterious, almost mischievious way (this man was about fifty-five, i reckon), and saying "oh, i think it'll be sooner than you think..."   i never saw him again.  n.

      the humidity of recent days has lead to increased insomnia, but has also lead to the first five minutes of returning home into a game of how fast the vast majority of my clothes can be removed. right now i am wearing only the shorts that earned me the name of 'chicken legs' earlier this year. maybe it is something about this room that tends the occupant towards nudity?  but i have done well today; visiting town for the briefest time i have bought a mouse for purely rational. as much as i like the trackpad, it is time for seriousness. seriosity, if you will.  serioucism?  anyway; the online delivery charge of 30% of the mouse's worth causing the trip to town, i was pleased to quickly find the one i wanted on the shelf. in a cylindrical-type packaging, admittedly very fetching, there was no information as to whether the software is on cd or diskette. i asked the man in the shop "is the software on cd for this mouse?". i held up the mouse i meant. "oh yes", he said.  let me tell you now, he is a lying swine.  so now i have no immediate way of loading my mouse driver. purely rational has no floppy drive ( it is a laptop of the  future , and besides i couldn't be bothered to pay for an extrenal drive). my old laptop  does  have a floppy drive, but it doesn't have a cd burner. nor does it have a modem or network plug. or usb ports. (it is a laptop of the  past , and besides, it was free). in fact, of their 26 assorted ports and things, there is  no way whatsoever  that i can make the two machines talk to each other in the way i would like without buying some extra (read: 'expensive') hardware. shocking. anyway, i've arranged for it to be done now. but ergh, it annoys me. i might write a snotty letter to dixons (no link because they are evil evil lying swine, although they offer cordless optical mice at affordable prices) and hope they send me  urlLink something cool .   new cd: welcome interstate managers, by fountains of wayne. very good.   stopping by the supermarket on the way home to spend a fortune (£14) on my continued survival, it is interesting to note the hastily-erected shelving selling umbrellas. in august? sheesh. i pick up some essentials (bread, milk), some healthy things (oranges, tomatoes), and some random bits (stir-fry sauce, biscuits). i have recently taken to swiss-style meusli, that is to say meusli with raisins, nuts, and no extreme political views.  i resent paying over  urlLink 50p  for a loaf of bread; sure it tastes nicer but seeing as i never get through a loaf fast enough to avoid throwing the last three or four slices away (as i did this morning). i am now trying 'stays fresher longer' bread, 44p. i have high hopes; except i have doubt about the grammar. shouldn't it be 'stays  fresh  longer', or just 'stays fresher'? or am i too worried about my bread?   the last thing to mention today is the post office; and some interesting distinctions in the british postal service. i am sending a friend a cd, and i am enclosing a brief letter with it. if i send it as a 'small package', it is cheaper than sending it letter-rate. imagine you are sending someone a book; if you send it on its own it is a small package and can be sent (relatively) cheaply. if, however, you enclose a 'letter' with it, then as far as the post office is concerned the  entire weight  of the parcel is your letter, and you are charged accordingly. but what constitutes a 'letter'? for the small package rate you are allowed to enclose a brief letter which references only the item you are sending. so, if you write "dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it" then no problem. but write "dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it. little malcolm fell off his bike yesterday..." then pow! you have just (according to the postal service) written a comic novel. so if they ask you if there's a letter inside when you're at the counter, you know what to say. and you too can make sure you're sending things as cheaply as possible, even if it does mean you have to write (as i do) "small package" on everything you send...   nmrboy's currently favoured dinner: pasta (enough for 2, cooked) cheese (small cubes of) cooked ham (diced) tomato (1, raw, chopped) olive oil ( extra  virgin, whatever that means) basil (not a siberian hamster)  all mixed round together, serve hot and frequently. food = good; or at least its the most similar word you can form with a standard 'qwerty' keyboard. coincidence? well, probably...  n.

      a slow day; getting things done like cutting your toenails tend not to count as truly productive, they are to the working day as shampoo is to the shopping list: something that occasionally has to be done, but more of an imposition than anything else.  thesis word count: 650  like i say, a slow day. but, i have been having some fairly interesting thinks. i mean thoughts.  i) truth: if everything we know or learn is (necessarily) brought to us by our own perception, then it doesn't matter whether there is any absolute truth because we will never know it.  ii) labels: labels on relationships only serve to give rise to expectations of certain behaviour; expectations drawn from the media, demographic ensembles and hearsay that can never realistcally be matched by any random (that is to say non-specific) individual. this mis-matching of expectation with reality (regardless of how perfect the reality) leads to disappointment and eventually conflict. the need to categorise things is an outward desire, and serves no purpose to the individuals involved, who will tend to know what's going on. the driving force is to have a neat labelled pigeon-hole-type box for the relationship that others will understand with the minimum of explanation; but if every relationship (an analogue quantity if every there was one) is forced into one of any number of discrete boxes (digital classification) then the fit will never ne perfect (analogue-to-digitl conversion, and information is irrevocably lost). its just  laziness , that's all. pisses me off that people can break up over such an unnecessary thing.  iii) gravy boats and gravy trains. no gravy planes.  iv) language: when was the last time anyone described themselves to you as 'hot' or 'cold', instead of 'really hot' or 'really cold' (or the like)? language is something that people invented, and yet they don't use it properly? if words have definitions, and we can invent new words with appropriate definitions as needs be, then why isn't language sufficient to expess what we want to say? and if it  is  sufficient, then why don't we use it properly? this follows a conversation i had recently, which went roughly as follows:  ros: i guess that depends on what you mean by 'happy'. guil: the oxford english dictionary defines it as 'feeling or showing pleasure or contentment'. ros: yeah, well i wouldn't define it  that  way.  anyone else find that amusing/frustrating? mind you, to get technical, i guess it depends how you define 'definition'. or something.   enough thoughts! i should get out more.  v) i should get out more.   todays's list is of synonyms for 'list': bank careen heel incline lean slant slope tilt tip   n.

      terrestrial british television is currently enjoying the simultaneous playing of great films: 2 has pulp fiction, 3 has unbreakable, and 4 has the shawshank redemption. we shall say nothing of red heat on 1, or the over-stylised american cop series on 5.  i hate moths. and wasps and flies and all those buzzy things that annoy me late at night. they fully deserve my attacking them with my  bokken , oh yes.   a very serious thing has happened; today i realised that  urlLink charlotte 's birthday has passed without my noticing. an indication of something? a milestone? perhaps neither, but certainly noteworthy. happy birthday, charlie.   the time has come to abandon my life in favour of what i must do. my friends, the phd has begun. not an auspicious start, it being four months or so too late, but it has begun all the same. i shall keep you updated. unfortunately, it will mean less time for finding bizarre but wonderful things like  urlLink this , but that is the price i must pay. for all the analysis is helping me understand my own mind and those of others, it is worthy to note that the solution of problems still comes down to just 'getting on with it'.   thesis word count: 404  more to come.  n.

      it seems that i am a difficult person to get hold of; or so i have been recently told by more than a couple of people. the main downside to (gasp) not having a mobile telephone was brought back to me today when it transpires that my best friend tried to call last night, and i wasn't around. unfortunate rather than malicious, but i'm still a little sad about it. especially since i was erely over in the common room, chain-watching buffy the vampire slayer until three in the morning. sorry, chief.  and as to the advice i can give you? its all guesswork, i'm afraid. there is no greater mystery than the intricacies of  urlLink women .   commenting on the heat (32 degrees! and not fahrenheit, you picky lot) in his office, he notes that he is becoming the incredible sweating man; and between us we decide that this would make a better arch-nemesis than super-hero. homeostasis as a way of fighting crime? hmm...   and yes, i measaured the bread. but i only did it roughly (to establish its non-squareyness), since presumably there is a variation in each slice, and trying to find the mean and standard deviation would just be silly. no, really. and what was the greatest thing before sliced bread? and when they made the first sliced loaf, did it have an even number of slices so making sandwiches was more convenient? what would they do with the last slice? and were the sparrows fatter?  all important questions, i'm sure you'll agree.   also catching my eye just yesterday was the notices around the lake (i use the word loosely) in our nearby park; reading danger: deep water, and danger: thin ice. now surely thin ice is only a danger because of the deep water beneath it? well, i suppose you could slip over, but i'm not sure that's what the sign is getting at. surely the sign should read:  danger: deep water danger: thin ice danger: gravity   i think this could also be applied to other situations:  danger: cliff face danger: gravity  danger: sharp bend danger: newton's  urlLink first law of motion    you get the idea. i will undoubtedly have something else to say at some point; but for now, i think tea and toast is the way forward. breakfast is, after all, the most important meal of the day. that's why i have it three times a day.  n.

      night is the worst; its when i wander more, when sounds seem louder, and when i still find time to talk to her memory. she is gone, appropriately through time (4 years? 5?) and space (some hundred miles, sometimes thousands), and yet the closest i get to someone understanding me at these times is to imagine her still here.  aside: i suppose sounds seem louder at night due to a simple comparison with other noise present, ie there is less background at night. the same way the moon seems larger when it is close to the horizon, for direct comparison with everyday objects?  i think too much. see? night is the worst.  n.

      what an entertaining morning! after the insights of therapy and the delight of having already had a shower (joy!), i headed off to the shortest film festival in the world (...ever!). this is run by the people at  urlLink nokia  who want you to buy their 'phones, and are selling them on the basis of their movie-making features. there are nine films, and all are less than fifteen seconds long. intriguing, yes? you can watch them on that link, if you like, but i nipped down to a local cinema to watch them on the big (ish) screen: a cinema with a small bench seat, the whole thing measuring 2 cubic metres. my favourite is, i think, 'the divorce', by a matt bloom. check it out.  more important though, and something i'm taking as some sort of sign, was one of the girls manning the booth was absolutely stunning; a becky jago-alike if ever i saw one. i'm tempted to go back. with a camera. and a better hairstyle. this sets me thinking about beauty again; clearly an important subject in my head. how can the simple existance of someone as pretty as [should have asked her name, dammit] cheer me up for the day? we shared nothing except the most trivial of conversation. what is at work here? most curious. what is worst of all is that on account of her face (okay, teeth mainly. and nice eyes.) i am actually going to go to the website to enter the competition to win the damn 'phone! i am being manipulated by someone, and what annoys me is that its probably me.   on the way home i stopped off at the charity shops and managed to pick up the new york trilogy, by paul auster (i can hear a certain  urlLink grey kitty  meowing at that one), for a mere one english pound and forty-nine pennies. i liked 'the invention of solitude', so i have high hopes (although not for happy endings....). in the same shop i also bought something eponymous by 'the for carnation' whom i have never heard of. a six track cd, with each track lasting over five and a half minutes, it will surely be value for money. what tipped the scales, however, was the tiny sleeve note announcing vocals on one of the tracks by a certain rachel haden, of  urlLink that dog  fame. fame? oh, alright then, but she's done backing vocals with  urlLink weezer  and jimmy eat world, and that's good enough for me.   other news is that the solid block of sugar that has been threatening to fall out of my sugar tin finally did so into one the most enjoyable cups of coffee i've had in a while, i am almost out of maple syrup on account of eating popcorn for most meals, and i have been thinking about happiness some more.   a hello to cathy; who can be beaten at minesweeper but is yet to crumble under the onslaught of my charm offensive. her hopes of having a starring role in this entry were scuppered by an unfortunate typo, and so now she is left with a  urlLink staring  role.  hee hee!   clocks in my rooms, and the times they show: wall clock: 1512 silver watch: 1245 purely rational (my computer) : 1639 digital watch: 1640 VCR: 0000 (blinking) alarm clock: 1639 other alarm clock: 1642 pocket watch: 1046 dress watch: 1331   i think this explains a lot; although not my love of punctuality..  n.

      and no, i'm not talking about the incessant rain. i actually like the rain; the seven-month manchester winter of grey and mizzle is part of the appeal. i guess i just like wearing coats, and to quote the  urlLink otters : the rain soothes the tempest that is my soul.  at my therapist's this morning we identify patterns that lead to my (quote) deviousness (unquote), and we learn exactly why it is that my mother (quote) pisses me off (unquote). i am sure that this is progress. on the way out, i pick up a leaflet for  urlLink calm , an organisation i fully support through my general apathy. the leaflet says "suicide is the biggest killer amongst men aged from 15-35 years old. it accounts for 21% of all deaths among this age group in britain. this phenomenon, which started in the 1970s, is echoed across europe, the us and australia". this is, i think you'll agree, quite startling. is does raise the question as to why men started killing themselves in the seventies? i blame fashion.  also, the telephone lines are open from 5pm to 3am, every day. these hours lead to two obvious conclusions: i) the miserable also need to sleep ii) men only become miserable after watching  newsround , which is understandable since the departure of the delectable  urlLink becky jago .   at eleven in the morning i am delighted to say i have already had four of the recommended five portions of fruit. they are: 1 bowl muesli (i avoided being pulled in by the strong currants) 2 satsumas 1 apple   i have been musing on happiness; i will return.  n.

      i never figured on any of this; that much you should know. whatever else happens, and whatever i am yet to be guilty of, i can't say that i planned it.  look, from time to time i'm a sensible kind of guy. i know i'll probably never be to you what i would like to be. i know it was just a result of your circumstances that made things the way they were, and now they've changed and everything has to settle down again. i guess i just wanted to put it down somewhere that i'm glad that i was lucky enough to be in the wrong place at the right time. i'm glad that i was able to glimpse something so much more than me.  n.

      the well-meaning drunk: oh, sure, their heart's in the right place, and i'm glad he stopped by to apologise for all the noise and such, but at half four in the morning there are better things i can think of doing. and i know he was drunk, but his admission that they'd "been a bit hard on me" was both pleasant and unexpected.  late night becomes early morning, and television becomes something else entirely. apparently doctor richard kimble is still on the run, and is these days looking like a poor man's gary sinise. this week he escaped by going out a window; genius.  on the subject of naff television, friday's episode of charlie's angels had one of them go undercover at a women's prison. initially set upon by the top dog (so to speak), she later gains a friend by rescuing a drowning woman from the swimming pool, and goes on to meet her contact in the massage parlour. this a  prison , yes? swimming pools and massage parlours? that's more facilities than a lot of hotels, and, well, wales.   quote of the day is me, on possible pick-up lines whilst 'cruising the toaster': "i like my toast like i like my women: white, thick and inexpensive..."   and a hello to sarah, our illustrious treasurer, who will surely be the best we have ever had: her arrangement of my alphabetical fridge magnets was precisely that: alphabetical. she just can't help it; and whilst it is undoubtedly a useful trait, its also very funny.  today's list is songs i try to play/sing on the piano: radiohead - fake plastic trees radiohead - karma police the boo radleys - wilder counting crows - a long december the bluetones - a parting gesture ben folds five - eddie walker ben folds five - evaporated  all good songs, even if my voice just isn't up to some of it. like that ever stopped me.  n.

      quote of the day is good even out of context:  "there are things you don't do. like your nieces."  thanks, greg.   i've been neglecting the blog of late, not through intention but through a combination of distraction and not really being sure of what to say. the days have been a mass of getting nothing done and sleeping in varying amounts of fitfulness. maybe this has lead to a time where i have nothing to say; the blogger page has lain open on my computer for many many hours, waiting but unsatisfied.  a meagre list; again of girls. they are, after all, what make any story worth telling. and so: girls that have been away and are returning to my life:  alex (4 months) ro (1 month) helen (12 months) rachael (12 months)   and they expect me to get any work done?  n.
