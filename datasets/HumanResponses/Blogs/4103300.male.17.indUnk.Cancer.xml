      Shooting .... Too easy .. hahaha Dzone went to Kaili's house area there yesterday ... cycling of course !! Met my friend (vanessa) at the basketball court .. after resting my tired legs someone approached for a match .. OK!! said dzone .. It was a two on two match ..  My new friend Alex and i gave them their first score ... 1-0 then it was time to start ( dunnoe why it is always my culture to let opponent score the first one) .. A pass to alex ... he hesitated a moment ... faked !! pass the ball to me ... i shooted n score ... Whoa .. didnt expect myself to be on form .. the rest result is expected a 11-3 scoreline with me scoring 7 . HERE COMES A NEW team ... 2 person and the game started ... my shooting seems to get a little out of angle and mos of the score is done by alex .. more layups than shooting in this match and after a long period of playing .. they SAID WE DIDNT COUNT THE SCORE !!!! Shit !! i was wearing out and i need to preserve energy for the next match of 4 vs 4 .... ok i admit i loss ... a little on purpose as their gfs are there watching them playing ... but the boy on the rival team also had a dead eye shooting skill .... lalala ... And the day continued with more matches and lame jokes .. at about 6.56 .. the gfs of the rival team actually wanted to challenge us .. Anything .. we playing and i wasnt even concentrating on the match .. it was time to go home ....  Todae's new term : Fine $5000 for running with the ball

      Ok ... looked into the mirror ... Time For Some Self-Reflection :: Chapter 1 Dzone went up close ... he saw something .. not pimple ... but a different self .. A self whom he hates ..   Why did he become and when did the change happened ...     During Sleep ??   Nope ... Lying & lying ... one lie covering another and as if it will never end so why bother to lie in the first place .. A humble and shy guy morphed into a stupid lame joker ...   TRY TO GET ATTENTION from  people .. y ?? U looked so silly . dun u have any other way to make friends ...   NOOOOO !! i Dun haf Chapter 2 Emotions :::: Getting worst and worst ... cant control my temper ... burst at anione at anytimes .. Sudden change in mood ... All these r my bad points ... not easily irriated though but when dzone is in bad mood .. it is timeout for jokers (juz leave him alone) Chapter 3 Actually there isnt a chapter 3 but ending it so fast seemed ... erm ... whats tat word .... aiya .. nvm ... juz no good can liaoz . So i decided to write what i did todae Green man flashing ... and zoom . went dzone across the road ... he prepared himself well and is confident that he would borrow a digital Camera soon .... The sun nearly evaporated all his moisture as he cycled towards his destination .. The building .. standing strong at all time .. fear no wind nor rain cose it is onli a building ( building dun haf feelings dumb dumb ) .. TP (not there is no k so it isnt TPK ) .. reached .. dzone took out his check list n put a tick on the checkbox (hahaha ... stupid right ... this is added on effect).. dashed in and seeked high n low for Steven ... not even a cell of him could be seen .... Gave up ... Dzone then saw someone familar ... it is Ah hou .. his secondary friend ... his class has already started doing their CCN ... i hate to say this but i felt so ashmad of my class ... dun want to lie anymore ... i joined in the fun and washed cars wif their class ............ WHOA , fun fun fun ! Got to noe girls from their class too ... a few pretty one .... but the onli one who left a scar on me had her name blacklisted .. hahaha ... no lah kidding .. she has a good character ( solely based on todae's activity onli/-) ... but she is violent ... veri . veri veri .... did i mention veri ?? lalalala!! Time check . 2-3pm . Mama called n had to do some chores ... after that went but to TP .. a quick good bye said and dzone rushed to Kaili's area there ... the basketball court is full of people but then none r my friends ... rushed back to TP and had a slip of the traditional bubble tea . taste as good as last time ..... Reached the bus stop waiting for his friend .... so long ... but still managed to see him ...  Tired and lazi to cycle to his house to play .. dzone cycled his half awaken bike n heads to wards home ..  Todae's new term : Make Foes as friends . Life will be brighter to haf more friends

        Please Give Your Comments    urlLink   "Some 40 schools , hotels and rest houses refused to offer lodging to the children whose parents died from AIDS after selling blood in unhygenic blood collection stations in central China " Pictures and information taken form the Newpaper august 11 , page 17  Why ? wHy ? whY ? The children themselves don't have Aids . . . why are they turned away , turned down ... this pissed me off ... The children are the innocent party here .. "their parents sold blood to earn money , often to build a house or pay thier school tuition . The blood was pooled and reinjected into the sellers after the plasma was extracted , causing large scale infections " ... Pity ... Pure pity .. Parents did all this to aid their children's upbringing but in turn they got AIDS .. Why didn't they work but chosen this path ? Good Question >> Let me tell u ... They are uneducated and know nothing about AIDS and selling of blood is easier then working . Died and children are left in this world .. Uninfected and innocent ... WHY are they still not allowed to stay in hotels or visit schools .... I look down on all of you ..Those are only children and what do you think they will think of about that ... What if they grow up to be the same .... STUPID MANAGEMENT!!! All you care is about image and sales, profits and not losses ... Where is the love in everybody's heart ..... GONE ???

Ya .. it wont . Then i tried to load the pictures taken by the camera to the com .. but nothing new happened ( as expected .. the stupid cube box hanged again ) I cycled to tampines in search of the P-CD shop .. here let desmond tell u how it went..      Hot n Sweaty , dzone cycled towards his target .. the shop ..  disappointment ---- the shop was no where to be found .. dzone quickly use his V200 ( finally repaired ) n dial for help ... he asked spiderman's gf , maryjane ... but she proved again tat she is an computer-dun-noe-anything .. okok dzone understand .. dzone then called serene .. she didnt answer .. After swearing at the sky for e stupid weather .. dzone call boon yong ... his best pal in primary school .. His information proved vital n useful ... without hesitation .. dzone speeded up as parkway isnt juz metres away from tampines . Wore out after reaching Tampines Primary School ... the road juz made life worst .. cars beep beep at dzone n dzone nearly fell ..... Not losing any hope . Dzone let out a warcry " Argh!!!!!!!!! Chong Ar !"(no lah .. dzone wont do that ... veri paiseh one . tis is juz to spice up e story ) n he cycled with all his might ... Suddenly ..a familar song was heard .. the song is too nice tat it APPEARED TO BE HIS RINGTONE ... Serene called n allowed herself to direct dzone . where the shop is .... The shop was found n cds was bought .. and dzone live happily ever after ....................... FOR TAT moment (wat a relief ... finally brought wat i want )  Okok ... snap out of tat .. real world now .. i reformatted my com n installed windows xp .... Yeah !! so happy but the stubborn camera still refused to give in .... haiz ....  Todae new term : Beep Beep Means Run For Your Life

Got so guilty and i took off ... zoom !!! Rain drops fell ... from the little little ones to huge ones and back to small ones again .. I watch the rain drops fell on my hand and wonder when the heck will i be able to enter the school .. Decided to walk around the building (school) to pass time ... walked around for 2 times n the security guard finally allow me to enter ....  Time passed fast in there ... in a moment of seconds ... it was my turn .... Panic caught up wif me ... tongue tied for  a few passages n the others went quite well ... PHEW !!! IT WAS OVER .. Went to their basketball court to play basketball and headed home after winning ... hehehe  Todae's new term : Enjoyment = Time machine ... by it onli bring us forward not back

      The day u toked to me ... called me haolian ... "stole" my handphone and my hp number ... That was also the day i wrote ur name and ur number all over my room ... Scolded by my mother but i didnt care ... all i care is tat i dun wish to lost any means of contacting u .... The nite was all reserved for ur smses and the minute my hp beep beep! i would picking up the hp as quick as light and check wat u wrote ... No matter wat tat was ... hafing ur name appearing on my hp is juz like having won one million us dollars ... No .. is more than tat ! ..U smsed once that i onli had a small place in ur heart ... It was love not greed tat overpowered me to send tat i want whole of ur heart .... u smsed me saying ur love for me is forever ... i was over the moon when i recieved tat sms .... why was it when we went separate ways and i smsed u the veri same message u sent me .... u ignored it ... The love is forever ... isnt it ....  This is tat veri day u stole my number .... and smsed .... messages wif love n concern ... this is the yesterday of the day we became lovers ....  Now i m here .... i still remembered ur shy smile ... ur soft spoken tone ... ur everything .. but was it love from u or r u seeking for someone to replace ur lost love b4 me ...   Not enough time for me   was ur reason for the breakup ... i didnt shear a tear for u ... but my heart beat slower than usual for you ... A violent part of me was born .. In the basketball was where it was unleashed !!  The sweet moments of me waiting for u at the bus stop ... the wait was long ... too long ... too long for a mere 3 minutes .. it seemed like a day had passed ... all these seemed useless to u but every now n then when i hav the time ... the bus stop loathed me for being bothering him .. wet or dry .. the strong wind n the cracking sound of the seat seemed to say ... it is time to move on ... no point staying here ...........    But i stayed there ... and till now i had always accompany the bus stop during the 4-5pm
