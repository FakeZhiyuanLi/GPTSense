      I went to the arcade with one dollar and made enough money to get more paper for the printer. It's so hard financing something when one is unemployed, but hey, I do have my resources.I'm going to have to put my idea of adding tshirt transfer pages to the magazine on hold for a while though until I get more income. Hopefully, I'll get that new job this week but who knows?

      Ah yes, just another manic Monday. It's almost a good thing that I am not working right now. I have so much to do. Have to start on new issue of the magazine, although God only knows when I will have the money to get paper and mail these out. I really don't understand why the maid company that I worked for fired me. They said I didn't belong there. (?) So where do I belong???? God I want to get caught up on the magazine issues so badly. Oh well, it will happen.

      Well, hello there! My name is Sheila and I do occassionaly go by the nickname of Granny Goth. Not that I am actually Goth anymore..hell, I'm kicking 50 in the ass! But there was a time back in the day...Anyway, I DO know quite a bit about the Gothic market out there so I created Dark Thoughts Magazine so that anyone who does the Goth poetry, artwork, or creative writing can get their stuff published. It has been quite a struggle what with being unemployed and all that jazz. But I am hoping to get that problem resolved VERY soon..maybe within the week if all goes well.

      Poor Papa and Angus had a bad night last night. One of our men dissappeared last night! Since it was during Papa's watch, he and Angus both feel responsible for this and are very distraught. Nothing was heard or seen, but Mikhael, the worker who vanished, hasn't been seen all day nor did he come home after his watch last night. Both Angus and Papa have gone to the neighboring village of Zeborg to see if they can find out anything about Mikhael's whereabouts but Papa has a bad feeling. We shall see.

       What a dull evening it is tonight, poor Angus had to work late again in the vineyard. So I am alone with you dear paper friend. For once, there were none of the grand thunderstorms which have plauged the area recently. Ah, such is life in the mountains! But this is where the work is and dear Papa and my new husband Angus have worked these magnificent vineyards for all of three years now. Tonight is a full moon and with the sky being clear enough to see, the men must watch the vineyard to make sure that all is safe from vandals who have been sneaking in to steal their fill of the grapes.   I am tired now, so will sleep..until later.
