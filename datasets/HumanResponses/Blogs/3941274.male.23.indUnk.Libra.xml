       i went to see the terminal last night. i enjoyed it. i thought it was going to be kind of cheesy for a little bit, but then it steered away from that. i was by far the youngest person in the theater besides some teenage girl there with her mother and grandmother. i didn't know so many middle-aged adults went to movies. i was the only guy who didn't have his shirt tucked in and without a date unfortunately. (two more weeks til i see tammi) on the way home i stopped at qwik trip to get a 49 cent fountain drink. i love those. i can get diet dr. pepper and add vanilla. so good. while i was in there there were these two teenage girls in there with what appeared to be their grandmother. now, i'm not trying to be mean but they looked pretty low class. they were dirty and just disheveled right. then i saw the grandmother had a goatee. yes, a beard. not like a few unlucky hairs. a full goatee all the way across her chin that was at least 2 inches long. it was as gray and nappy as the hair on her head. normally i would get a good laugh out of something like that, but this was too disgusting. i had to leave. so gross.         i heard from my new roommate yeterday too. he goes by nico and he's from argentina. it's going to be interesting.

       i got my diploma today! it's at home in florida so i haven't seen it but it's there. i'm mostly excited about the one for my wallet. that's cool. i'm slightly peeved because i graduated cum laude though. to graduate magna cum laude i had to have a gpa of 3.6 or better, which i did. but they only count my gpa at  urlLink campbell for honors, so my gpa from  urlLink bcf  doesn't count. which sucks because my gpa at campbell was like a 3.588. all i needed was one better grade in one class. the thing that's so irritating is that i blew off spanish last fall and got a c in there because i didn't care. if i would have at least gotten a b i would have magna. the reason this is important is because tammi graduated magna. finally my lack of studying catches up with me.       i also got a comforter yesterday. i got it at target. blue and white stripes for a good price. just what i wanted. butta, the duvet might have to wait for marriage.

       as i continued reading details i found out that the australian government has put a price tag on children. $2,121.45. that's what their government is giving parents for every child born in the next five years. they're trying to balance the aging demographic and this is their solution. i wish i was a breeding australian.

       british people are stupid. this is not my opinion. a poll proves it. i read in details magazine tonight about a poll that was taken in england. apparently 11% of the people across the pond believe that hitler was a fictional character and also that 5% of these same people believe that conan the barbarian was a historical figure. (is it an "a" or an "an" before a word starting with h? writers seem to go both ways. guess it doesn't matter. i'm too lazy to capitalize words too.) i thought i'd always arbitrarily disliked the british but now i have a reason. they're morons. speaking of dumb brits, happy birthday ert!

       according to micah, today i participated in a daily african tradition. tea. we made tea. doesn't sound like much does it? it was a big process believe me. first of all it required going out on the back deck. then we had to fire up the authentic, brought over from burkina faso (micah was a missionary there) tea grill. sounds weird doesn't it. well this grill is made from an old oil filter and you put charcoal in it. you light the charcoal, then once it's going good you take the grill by the handle and swing it around in big loops to distribute the heat. this is the cool part. then you put the first tea pot on and get the water going. then you add the tea, which is gunpowder tea, a strong tea from china. you put the actual leaves in the water. then you pour the tea back and forth between the two pots.  then you finish by adding sugar and mixing again. then you pour it out in shot glasses. that's all you can stand at a time. you can make three pots from one batch of leaves. the first pot is the strongest and the africans like it the best. micah won't drink it. he dumps it out. i tried it. it was disgusting. the whole experience was very enlightening. micah says the african guys can get a foam head on the tea like beer. that's rad. apparently the guys over there only work like three months a year during the rainy season. the reast of the year they just chill and drink tea i guess. makes me want to be african. but then i remember they can't listen to the postal service while drinking tea because they don't have electricity. that kills it. oh, the women work year round by the way. that truly makes me want to be african. (just kidding ladies) cheers for tea!

       i tried to look for a birthday present for tammi today. i still have a month but i thought i'd look while i was still making money. i was looking at clothes for her and i hate doing stuff like that. there is no way to peruse the girl's section in a store without feeling awkward and dirty. am i alone in this? the only thing worse is waiting for your girlfriend outside of a dressing room. women give you these glaring looks like they think you're a rapist and i just want to say, look i'm holding a purse, do you think it's mine? it's my girlfriend's, the one in the dressing room. but despite the purse you still get dirty looks. i didn't find anything for tammi, but while i was out i got a used copy of the rpyal tenenbaums for $10.

       that's what the package says. my brother and i played vet today and gave piper his shots. now my brother is extremely cheap so he decided why pay a vet to give his dog shots when we can do it at home? so that's what we did. the procedure was quick and painless. i did the prep-work and micah gave the shot.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;  that is such a great title

       the day just took an abrupt turn for the worse. i just found out that misty wells, a person i knew from college, died this morning. she was married to a buddy of micah's and more of a friend to him and tracy then me really. she has had heart problems all her life and been on the list for a heart transplant for a while. last week she finally received the transplant that she and trey, her husband, had waited for, for so long. it went well and she was making steady progress. she started to do a little worse two days ago but it wasn't supposed to be serious. now this. she had come so far....

       this is funny. i read tonight that nc recently expanded a bill about swearing around corpses. the previous law stated that it was illegal to swear around a corpse in a funeral home. the new law says that you cannot swear around a corpse anywhere. this got a majority vote?

       tonight i took a bucket of ice to a lady who was four doors away from an ice machine. she was too lazy to walk down there and instead called room service to bring it to her. this is ok if she tipped me, but she didn't. she said, "thank you so much". thank you so much does not put gas in my car, does not pay my rent, my tuition, or support my dvd habit. so knowing how much i like to complain i was displeased by this. it was only later when she called down for her whopping order of pudding and bread pudding, with water of course, that i found out she was a flight attendant with southwest. we have southwest and frontier flight crews staying at the hotel on a nightly basis. they get discounts on food and are generally rude, demanding, and cheap. the pilots aren't too bad. the flight attendants however, suck. the southwest ones are the worst. i don't know what it is about them, but they're so friggin annoying. anyway, who cares now. i'm off tomorrow and can sleep til late afternoon if i want. or not even get up. don't think i won't do it.

       i think this site is very good dealing with the topic of abortion which has been on my mind of late. i've gotta give credit to kate who informed me of it. thanks kate! do with it what you will.  urlLink abortion info

       i am kind of pleased to see that i have a post that racked up 17 comments. it probably shouldn't be surprising that voicing my rather strong opinions on abortion got a hearty response. it's a volatile subject but one that i'm passionate about. i just want to say that everybody play fair. now, i don't think anyone's been mean yet, but a subject like that has potential for some harsh words and criticisms. so keep it&nbsp;lively but good spirited if you don't mind. now, of course on topics that are posted for the sake of humor and heavy with sarcasm feel free to blast away!

       rob, the cook at work, has a new dog. it's an australian shepherd. i like australian shepherds. i had one who died last summer. she was 9. rob's dog has a date with scarlet today. scarlet is a girl dog he met at petsmart. he's 6 months old and she's 7 months old so he likes older women. she's also taller than him. it's good to know that not only can you get dog treats and leashes at petsmart, but you're beloved fido can also make a love connection there.

       the other night at work i tried fried calimari. that's squid. i'm not a very adventurous eater, "normal" things like ranch and mayonnaise make me nauseous. but it was fried and that makes everything look better. rob, the cook talked me into it. it was weird. squishy. not much taste really. i dipped it in wing sauce and that helped a lot. it wasn't bad but i think if someone ate a lot of it it would make you really sick.

       that's how many days i've worked in a row counting today. i am finally off tomorrow and friday. after that only three more working days at the marriott for me thanks to tim jenkins and the mini-vacation he created for me. i've developed a new habit. tea. i now drink tea on a daily basis. i've been reading how good tea is for you, unsweetened of course. particularly green tea. so i've created a tea habit of green tea and vanilla tea. it's better than coffee and less hazardous than alcohol and cheaper than both. i'm satisfied with my choice. it also fits into my plan of trying to be a little healthier. this plan is what made me&nbsp;eat a slice of cucumber and a piece, yes only a piece, of lettuce last week. i despise all things green, besides tea now, so those were big steps.

       apparently all the army guys who aren't in the middle east are staying at the marriott for 10 days. i walked into the lobby today and thought we were under attack. there are 150 servicemen doing some training over at ft. leavenworth and they're staying with us. i'm not a fan of military men, if you didn't know. also, why are they staying at the marriott? isn't that a waste of tax dollars? how is this preparing them for the front lines? let em stay in a tent! they're in the army right?     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       men are discriminated against. i've been looking for some new sheets and possibly a new comforter since i'm moving on up to a double bed in the new apartment.&nbsp; now, i want something that's simple and masculine right but not just a solid color. i was thinking maybe like blue stripes or something. i'm sticking with blue. that's a given. however simple things like stripes aren't available. it's like bedding manufacturers think that there are two types of men, those who sleep in twin beds and those who sleep in beds where women picked out the sheets. now i've always been one of the guys in a twin bed. but not anymore. but it will still be solitary confinement and i want manly sheets and comforter. i've learned an awful truth. once you share a bed with a woman, you're sleeping on girly sheets for the rest of your life. that's what it looks like in the stores anyway. i did find one striped comforter. it was $200. obviously not designed for a man. what dude spends $200 on a comforter? that's beyond metro to me. so i'm disdgruntled. what's so difficult about some stripes?

       not really. just mine. i got up at noon today. it was one yesterday. do you realize how short the day is when you get up at one and you have to leave for work at 2:30? i know the remedy to this is getting up early but that's not really an option. it is the summer and college graduate or not, summer is for sleeping. maybe&nbsp;if i went to bed before like 4 in the morning i could get up earlier. school is going to make me tired. thank goodness i have no classes before 1.&nbsp;

         tis the season for campaigns and elections so i thought i'd throw in my two cents. now i've read a lot of people and star and other mindless gossip magazines at work&nbsp;out of boredom. i'm slightly amused by entertainers political involvement. it's very trendy right now to be anti-war and anti-bush. it's cool to say you want peace not war in concert (i.e. coldplay). i am not here to talk about the war and whether it is good or bad, i'm still up in the air about that. i am interested in the reason most people are against it. concensus seems to be that the war is wrong because it's needless loss of life. however, this is again directed at the entertainers, these same people who are upset over the death of a soldier willingly support abortion rights.&nbsp; for me personally, abortion is probably the one political issue i feel strongest about. i believe in all abortion being illegal, no exceptions. it is the taking of an innocent life and the majority of the time it is for convenience not because of tragedy. abortion ends life, an innocent life without question, so that equals murder. in war, lives are ended justly, which is no less tragic but not murder. can there be a more calculated, pre-meditated taking of life, a life that has no defense whatsoever, &nbsp;than abortion? it's simply not possible. i know that the three biggest arguments&nbsp;supporting legalized&nbsp;abortion are cases of rape, incest, or the life of the mother being in jeopardy. my answer is that those are awful acts, but is the wrong and suffering of rape and incest righted by extinguishing the young life of a yet-to-be born child? it is not&nbsp;a positive situation for sure,&nbsp;but the baby should not suffer.&nbsp;as for the case of the mother's life being in danger i go to the bible, specifically job who said that the lord gives life and the lord takes away life blessed be the name of the lord. also in hebrews we are told that it is appointed unto man once to die.... as a christian i take these for fact and must place my faith in them. who are we to decide that a mother's life is more valuable than a child's? or to place the same ethical question in a different scenario, would we laud a soldier who left a wounded, defenseless comrade on the battle ground because there was potential for him to be hurt as well? or should a parent leave their six year old child in a burning building for fear of suffering also? why are we willing to die for our children once they are born but are all too willing to forfeit that same right for a child who hasn't had the opportunity to see the sunlight and breathe clean air? these are just some thoughts of mine on a subject that matters to me and is the main reason i will be voting for george w. bush again in nov. i cannot and will not support a candidate who is not a strong pro-life candidate.

       how good of a day was today! i'll tell you the truth i woke up tired this morning in a bad mood not wanting to go to church but not wanting to skip because my brother's the pastor. however church was good for me, my brother preached well and my attitude was better afterwards. work was decently entertaining tonight so i enjoyed that. the good stuff started happening when i got off and saw i had 4 voice mails on my phone. one was from jordan and one was from lane. two guys i love. i'll have to call them back later. the other two were from the stunna aka tim jenkins. he is headed out here next week! i mentioned in a previous post that he and i were plotting and this is what we were up to. we're going to st. louis one night to go to a cardinals game and stay at the marriott (perks of the job). then we'll have a couple more days to hang out in kc. it's gonna be good. next week can't get here fast enough. you people just don't know how much of a good time i have with mr. jenkins. i think i'll even save the rest of my m-80's for&nbsp;next week. &nbsp;then i finished the night by talking to my wonderful girlfriend tammi. it's been a good one.

       she's drunk and naked. and cheating on her husband. let me give you&nbsp;the rundown of two phone conversations i had with&nbsp;this particular woman tonight. first she calls to order food but she wants it really fast because she's starving. she does not know what she wants because she is "buzzed and it's all japanese to me right now" so i suggest the club. she wants a guarantee that it will be there really fast so i assure her we'll do what we can. she tells me she'll give me $5 cash if i get it there fast. so she calls back 15 minutes later wanting to know where her food was. she claims i told her it would be there in 5 minutes and i remind her that she said that not i. she's really drunk by the way. so she's like, "well get your a$% up here and bring me my food". i tell her it's on the way and she's like "oh, should i get dressed because i'm naked". i reply that she can do whatever she feels like as far as i'm concerned. then she wants to know if she'll get arrested for answering the door naked. i tell her we'll leave the cops out of it just for her. then she wants to know if i'm bringing the food up and i tell her no and she tells me she will give the server $5 to give to me. i hang up and sherry comes back from the delivery and sure enough she has $5 for me and said that the woman told her i was her boyfriend. all i know is the wendy's i ate was on the drunk girl tonight. it turns out the lady is in the hotel because she's having an affair with some guy and that's why they're there. also, tonight i was told by a roughly&nbsp;16-18 year old girl who works in banquets that she used to think i was an a#$hole but now i'm pretty cool. apparently i'm just the bees knees with the ladies tonight.

       &nbsp;this is not a new revelation but was reinforced again tonight. first of all i thought that pretty much everybody understood that room service serves food. that you pay for.&nbsp; tonight though i got 4 calls from various rooms asking for items like pillows and blankets. this is a normal occurrence. now, i thought that people who stayed at marriott's might have a little bit more class than people who frequent motel 8s and the like. we do offer more than a light left on for you. but no, these people are dumb. it also chaps my tail when they phrase their order, "i would like to get ______ sent up." i dislike the term sent up. that makes me think of a period of well over a hundred years ago where wealthy people had servants that "sent things up" to their guests. i know it's really a small detail but it irks me nonetheless. a last note. tonight there was a guest in our restaurant who complained that the menu said we had "warm" bread pudding and he was angry because his was "hot". people suck.

       so the cowboys have eddie george now and no chad hutchison. i'm happy with both. i do not like the fact that vinny testaverde is a cowboy. that is not cool.&nbsp; i was on their site the other day and found out that i can get a skybox for one game for&nbsp;eight people for $3500. i wish i had money.    &nbsp; athlon's college football magazine has the gators ranked 15 pre-season. kind of disappointing. however, i will be at the games in the swamp so who cares! the wolfpack were ranked 31 though and that made me smile. i don't know why, but in three years in nc i developed a deep loathing for them.      the first season of boy meets world comes out on dvd on aug. 24. soooo excited.

       my brother got a dog the other day. his two new cats ran away last weekend, the second pair to do this, but they have been replace by a dog, a much better alternative. the new dog's name is piper. named after the preacher/author micah likes. that is the sort of thing that is normal in my family. i like this dog. i pretty much like all dogs infinitely better than cats though. also, about a mile from micah's house there is a dump truck for sale in somebody's yard. i find this really odd. that is not the sort of thing you sell in your yard. yards are for yard sales, normal vehicles, boats, fruit if you want but not heavy equipment. either way, i want it. i don't know what i'd do with it, but i want it.    &nbsp;  in unrelated news i finished the great gatsby on tuesday. i liked it. first time read for me. now i'm three chapters deep in orthodoxy. it is very good, ut deep and takes some time to read. i like it a lot and now want to read heretics, also by chesterton.

       ok, so i dislike the blogger commenting system so i switched to haloscan on the advice of tim jenkins, good advice. however, when i switched all previous comments made here were erased. i feel totally cheated. every witty word that i thought would last forever in internet land are a memory. so, jeff i need your e-mail address again. i hope you'll read my blog twice. anybody who wrote anything particularly funny will now have to recall it from memory and type it again. &nbsp;ahhhhh........

       i have to report that i previously gave out false info on my standing in the praxis scores record books at campbell u. i was slightly mislead about my info because it was delivered via third party. however today i received an e-mail from dr. woolard herself and she told me that i was only one point off the record which was held by two previous students who had graduated with their masters and that i alone hold the undergrad record! i am numero uno baby. the view from the top is sweet indeed.

       a couple of weeks ago i heard on the radio that this guy in australia had done research on the best way to pee. he said that for both&nbsp;guys&nbsp;and&nbsp;girls that&nbsp;it is better to sit down to pee to fully empty the bladder. not only sitting down though. the best method according the pee doc , is to sit with your elbows on your knees. to that i ask, who devotes their life to studying this stuff? i don't care, i'm standing up. sitting down seems somewhat like being neutered. plus why waste the talent of being able to write your name in the snow?

       i was back at wal-mart tonight because that's where i go and i had to get new, dr. ert prescribed medicine for my poison whatever and again i wandered into the cd's. there is a new mercy me cd with two new hit songs! repulsive. i'm beginning to loathe them which is as un-christian as i claim they are i guess so i should stop. more irritating than mercy me though was two other cd's. one was music inspired by the movie, the passion of christ. now i have nothing against the movie. i went to it, i appreciate it, and i will buy the dvd. however this cd had a song by elvis presley on it. now i know this movie has had a lasting effect on some people,&nbsp;but &nbsp;i'm pretty sure that the king did not raise from the dead to record a song for this cd?&nbsp;do i need to go on at the absurdity of this? i&nbsp;don't think so. why will "  christians"&nbsp;market anything that looks profitable? and even worse, why do people buy it?&nbsp;i also&nbsp;saw the cd of the hits from this years dove awards (christian grammys). now i'm opposed to the dove awards as&nbsp;a whole. what is the point of lauding christian artists&nbsp;if we as christians are to be meek and humble? just my opinion. also, i really dislike the worship sub-genre of christian music. how can something be labeled as a worship song? i guess the theory is that the words to the song are worshipful but i don't buy that because in a church service to be considered "worship songs"&nbsp;a certain musical style must be used, and preferably a "praise team". now if it was the lyrics that mattered then why do we have to come up with a new arrangement for how great thou art before it transforms&nbsp;from a hymn into a worship song? now this&nbsp;is just another rant of mine and i probably shouldn't be so openly critical of&nbsp;others spiritual depth when i am swimming in some shallow waters&nbsp;myself. but as i am reading the sermon on the mount for the umpteenth time in another attempt to have its simple yet so difficult truths soak into my life, i am seeing a jesus who is nothing like his current followers. thankfully&nbsp;because He is that different&nbsp;person there is hope and love for a stubborn jackass such as myself.&nbsp; here's a few lines from a little ditty that i love,&nbsp; "o to grace how great a debtor daily i'm constrained to be! let thy goodness like a fetter bind my wandering hear to thee. prone to wander Lord i feel it, prone to leave the God i love. here's my heart o take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above"

       i bought the movie leonard part 6 today on amazon.com for only $1.20. i remember watching this movie as a kid and i thought it was hilarious. all the reviews on amazon said it was possibly the worst movie ever made. i liked it. it has bill cosby in it and an assassin trout and i don't really remember what else but it's funny. oh and it's on vhs because there is no dvd.

       i counted all the change i've been putting in a bottle all summer and i have roughly $42. that's a lot of change. not enough though. i want more. also, i made $187 tonight. that's in  eight  hours. what is that, $23 an hour or so? my old job at ruby tuesday was so uncool. on top of the cash, my manager bought me dinner tonight. he's a cool guy. nothing like kelly from fuquay. man she sucked.

       i saw something today at best buy that really disgusted me. i was looking at the cd's in the christian section when i saw the cd, i can only imagine: the lullabies. most of you have probably heard the song i can only imagine by mercy me on the radio. i used to really like that song like 4 years ago. i also used to really respect mercy me because they recorded, produced, and sold their own cd's with their own money. they were kind of hard to find. i bought an old cd of theirs that had i can only imagine on it in 2000 at a local christian bookstore back home. it was the "indie" version. then their song became a hit. i really didn't mind that. then they signed to a big label. they were a little less cool at that point but i'm not going to down them for wanting a little financial security. i quit paying attention to them when they came out with the special wal-mart exclusive cd with i can only imagine on it. but this cd today was terrible. it is the lead singer of mercy me with some chick with a redone version of i can only imagine on it along with jesus loves me and other songs done as lullabies. now how can you call this christian music when it is nothing more than a marketing scheme? to me 95% of christian product is purely a money-making product which makes it inherently un-christian in my mind. i have no problem with entertainment with a christian message. just don't tell me it's your "ministry" and give me the opportunity of being "ministered" to for $15.99. just call it a cd with a message and quit lying.&nbsp; the lullabies cd is right up there with the&nbsp;butterfly kisses&nbsp;craze and the christmas shoes phase. wake up christian people. this stuff is crap.     &nbsp;  once, twice, three times my savior.............it worked for creed didn't it?

       i might have changed my mind for my mid-life crisis. i like the idea of driving an armored truck. you get to carry a gun, a lot of money, and you always do things in a hurry so you don't get robbed. it looks exciting. i saw a guy walking out of circuit city today with a bag that i assume was full of money. he was walking really fast and looking at everyone suspiciously. i had an urge to be that guy. something tells me i'm going to stick to pilot though. so don't worry stunna and danielle, you're future jobs look to be secure

       i got it! the aqua teen dvd vol 2 is mine. i made a special trip to best buy just for that. i also ate at chipotle while i was in kc. their burritos are so good. i&nbsp; went to barnes &amp; noble&nbsp;too&nbsp;and bought orthodoxy by g. k. chesterton and a book about van gogh's paintings that was only $5. quite a haul i think. i also knocked one item off the to-do list. i drove by my old church and house. there were some cars in the church parking lot and i recognized one of them so i went inside. i got to see a few of the people i went to church with there so that was cool. i hadn't really thought about but i have quite a few memories there. i also went into metro north mall today while i was in kc. that is where i had my first job when i was 15, at amigos, a mexican restaraunt in the mall. it has been closed for several years now though. it was nice to see these places i haven't been to in six years. i think i have an odd fascination of visiting places i used to work at and live in. is this normal? or maybe i just have a greater opportunity because i've moved so much. no matter, today was full and satisfying. &nbsp;anyway, time to watch aqua teen. still waters run deep.

       i'm currently living with my brother and sister-in-law and my 8 month old niece for the summer. they've been nice enough to give me a bed and feed me and stuff. my niece, sarah grace, is a great source of amusement to me. the funniest thing though is her new discovery. she just figured out how to sort of crawl. but she only uses her arms to pull herself around with no help from her legs. this has made her pretty mobile. what's funny about it to me is, it makes me think that she looks like a parapalegic trying to crawl after they fell out of their wheelchair. these are the sort of associations my mind makes. so wrong.

       ok, so i talked to tammi tonight (my girlfriend) and she read my blog today. she was upset that she did not get enough mentions on here. i can see her point. i tell her i love her more than anything in the world then i write about blenders. she should come before blenders right? so this is for her. just a quick rundown, we met at campbell, we've been dating a year and nine months officially, and i do love her more than anything in the world. now i know i might get some flak from certain fellas for these comments but i truly love her and care more about her than ya'll. sorry. that being said, she makes me happy and i can't wait to see her again in a month. it's been a long summer without her. also, she got a stuffed koala that &nbsp;i picked up at the zoo, in the mail today&nbsp;along with a card from yours truly. pretty sweet of me right? maybe it'll make up for not mentioning her enough on the blog. tammi, i love you!

       i hate fat people. now i don't mean people who are kind of pudgy or carrying a few extra pounds or a well-earned gut. i'm talking about FAT people. people who make you&nbsp;tired when you watch them walk because it's obviously a chore. the type that are grossly fat but not embarrassed by it and conitnue to stuff their pie holes with more doughnuts and wash those down with buckets of coke. those are the people i don't like. people that know me well already know how i feel about this. the best comment i have ever made concerning this fact is, "if she's fat she's dead to me". this was in reference to potential, future weight gain on the part of my girlfriend. i know this sounds mean but it's not. it's just incredibly shallow, which i am. my girlfriend is not fat by the way. but today while i was running, i was thinking of this fat woman who was walking in front of me last night&nbsp;while i was delivering an order to a room. she was totally slowing me down and i think it was mostly due to her monstrous backside. how do you get that way? i think fat people should just all live together&nbsp; in a fat colony and have fat, happy families together and leave the rest of us alone. maybe this is cruel, i don't care. fat ain't cool.

       i thought i should make an announcement on here for the masses. i passed the praxis exam back in april and received my teacher's license in the mail a few weeks ago. (now, if i could only get my college diploma i'd be set) i am now certified to teach physical education and health in north carolina for grades k-12. and i have decided to forego that option entirely and go to grad school for something different all together. but i could teach if i want and that's the point. also, it should be mentioned for my own&nbsp;swelling head&nbsp;that i scored a 171 on the praxis which is one point off of the school record. and before you say, "yeah, well that's cu, who cares?" you need to realize that we have the highest passing rates in the state and nc is in the top five of minimum passing scores in the nation. and to further stroke my ego, i've decided that if i hadn't taken it the day after the formal with only 3&nbsp;hours of sleep and no studying&nbsp;i might have done better. so there, i'm a genius. at p.e. at least. on a totally unrelated subject i have poison ivy/oak/sumac, you take your pick, on my legs and it's driving me crazy. i'm going to have to go to wal-mart to get some stuff.

       so i'm in the market for a blender right now because i like smoothies and i need one. and when you need something that makes it a responsibility.&nbsp;anyway i was looking online and i found this     &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.target.com/gp/detail.html/ref=br_1_1/601-0470854-3000131?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;asin=B0000AR8LB &nbsp;   it has titanium blades! but $180 is ridiculous for a blender. then i found this     &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=2618817&amp;cat=90766&amp;type=1&amp;dept=4044&amp;path=0%3A4044%3A4064%3A90546%3A90766 &nbsp;   more affordable and it looks like it could be fun. either way, i'm still searching. do you know how much protein is in a weenie smoothie?   BLEND!

       i just got done watching the new mobb boss dvd. it truly rocked. i see that ert and the&nbsp;boys have been doing their deep knee rock squats and it paid off with a show that melted faces. i thoroughly enjoyed it. it was pretty well done. also, i want to know if i am the first to purchase a mobb boss dvd? let me know ert! i liked the shout out at the end to buies creek. too bad i couldn't have been there. clearly even after 6 years, i still graduated from college too soon. thank God for grad school so i can continue to put off the "real world". the only real world i need in my life has a carefully selected cast and is produced by mtv. when is the release date for the mobb boss cd? and t-shirts? as your most valued customer at this point i believe you fellas should pay attention to my thoughts and accommodate me as much as possible. anyway, ert, flip, jon, and adam well done! now change your name to something involving ert!! the people must be heard!

       i just realized tonight that i am moving into my new apartment in gainesville in exactly one month from today. that is so cool. only three weeks left of work. that's even cooler. i also realized i haven't done everything i wanted to do this summer. here is a short to do list i must accomplish before i head back to the sunshine state. 1. go to the art museum in kansas city 2. go the negro league hall of fame in kansas city 3. go to the jazz museum and district in kc 4. stroll around the plaza in kc 5. drive by my old house i lived in and church my dad pastored back in 97-98 for nostalgia's sake 6. visit the state park that's close by here. so there's at least six things i've gotta do in the next three weeks. that might be tough. i've gotta decide what to start with this week any suggestions?

       today was all around a satisfying day. church was good. i go to missouri valley baptist church where my brother is the pastor. i feel somewhat obligated because i'm living rent free in his house, eating his food, and currently using his computer. but that's not why i go there. i like hearing him preach. it was a natural transition since my dad was my pastor for a long time so i have a preference for sermons from family memebers. work was slow again tonight so i read a lot. i finished The World As Best As I Remember It: Through The Eyes of a Ragamuffin. It's a collection of articles the late rich mullins wrote in release magazine during the mid 90's. rich mullins is my favorite musician of all time mostly for the man he was but also for his music. his biography, an arrow pointing to heaven is my favorite book. everyone should read it. after i read that i got about halfway through the great gatsby, which i bought in omaha last weekend at the suggestion of tim jenkins. i like it so far. on the way home i heard the old country song, fishing in the dark. nothing i love more than old country on the radio, my favorite music when i was a little kid. makes me think of langley air force base and hampton roads, va and 94.3 keys country, my favorite station when i was 10. kind of ironic that i stopped listening to country at the same time i moved to a house on a dirt road outside of wausau, fl. it was a change for the better though.

       this morning i got up and made the caramel rolls i bought last night at wal-mart. they're like cinnamon rolls with caramel icing. so good. they're all gone now since we all got home from church and everybody else found them. the good thing is i have more for tomorrow. i have now expanded my baking repertoire to include cakes, apple crumb, and now caramel rolls. maybe i should be a pastry chef in mid-life instead of a pilot.

       i decided something today. i settled on the mid-life crisis i will have several decades from now. i am not going to buy a convertible and date 20 year olds. i'm going to become a commercial airline pilot. after working beside an airport and delievering a lot of food to pilots i think it looks cool. but i don't want to do it now. so the only logical choice is a mid-life crisis. now i know that some would say that logic would dictate discerning a career for the present first, but i prefer to be surprised while i'm young and plan ahead for the latter years. also, at the hotel the pilots like to ask,"who's on the menu" in reference to the flight attendants which is pretty funny to me. all in all i'm happy with my choice. so in about 20-25 years come fly the friendly skies with "this is your captain speaking" the freezer.

       i have a powder blue shirt! two in fact because i was holding my 8 month old niece and the girl thought she could use an adult xl shirt. the game was kind of fun. i got to stay til the end of the 6th. by that time the royals were down 3-0 and i hear they lost 4-1 so i saw most of the big stuff. then i did the work thing. it was slow, which i enjoyed. after work the day took a turn for the better. first i talked to tammi (my girlfriend) as is the nightly ritual. she's in nc and i haven't seen her since we graduated in may. those phone calls are getting old. not the talking to her part, i wouldn't miss that. the fact that i can only talk to her on the phone sucks. only one more month though! after i talked to her i called my old roommates, ert and chad and was surprised when butta answered the phone. not only was he at the apartment but so was the bad mofo and the duke. so i had a good time talking to everybody on the speakerphone. i miss those guys a lot along with the stunna and the other butta. college was great. this jim/nicholas guy has a lot to live up to and i refuse to lower my standards.     &nbsp;  juice crew.......juice crew......juice crew........juice crew.......juice crew......juice crew......juice crew.....

       i talked to my mom today and she told me i got a letter at home (in florida) about my new apartment. all she could remember was that i have a roommate named nicholas. i have mixed feelings. i knew it was inevitable for me to have a roommate but i was still dissapointed that i officially have one. i guess i should give him a chance. i don't even know him. what i really want to know is if he goes by his real name, nicholas. i have a current streak of never having had a roommate who went by his given first name. i lived with my brother micah, first name paul. then joel, first name joseph. next a patrick who was really richard and ed who was thomas. the last two were ert and chad, real names robert and james respectively. now all of this is meaningless but an odd coincidence indeed. so i've decided to go with the odds and i've christened nicholas "jim".

       tonight was a long night like i expected. it was really busy which is a good thing because i make more money that way. speaking of money i made $220 tonight so i'm not going to complain about it. i am ready for the angus association people who are staying at the hotel to leave.     &nbsp;  tomorrow i am getting up before noon to go to a baseball game. it's the royals-twins, but i don't really like baseball. it should be a good time though and they're giving out powder blue t-shirts, which is apparently a very popular thing. i'm always up for a free (sort of) t-shirt

       The other night I saw Anchorman, Will Ferrell's new movie, and i laughed so hard at a conversation I overheard there I decided I needed a blog so I could share stuff like this. I was sitting in the theater and this old couple sits down in the row in front of me. They were talking during the previews and we all know old people can't whisper so it was really loud. The only part I caught was the old man telling the old lady that, "I'm blind in my left eye, so I have to turn my head to see the screen." This made me laugh harder than anything I saw in the movie, even though the movie was very funny, and was worth the price of the ticket. Then something occurred to me that made it even funnier. This old couple must be on a  date.  If they had been married for 50 years she'd surely know he was blind in one eye. I found the whole situation hilarious. They left halfway through the movie by the way.

       i went to the beach this morning. first time all summer. that's sad. it was great though. i went with my friend aj. panama city beach is awesome. not the town, the actual beach. white sand and clear warm water makes for good times. i always see the ocean as a challenge so i talked aj into swimming out as far as we could. the pier goes out about 100 yards and we swam past that. and kept swimming. and swam some more. thankfully even though it was probably about 15-20 ft deep we could see the bottom still. no shark sneak attacks on the gulf coast. after the shore was looking far away we started swimming back in. this is much harder than getting out there. it seemed like we swam forever before we could stand again. it was worth it though. after some laying on the sand we got some grub and headed back for graceville. this was a weekly thing last summer. so satisfying. now, i have to start going through my stuff and packing. i've decided to become a minimalist. we'll see how good i am at that. i like stuff so much so that creates a problem. i'm determined to minimize though. i have 12 pairs of shoes i think. that is unneccessary. i left 3 pair in mo too. i'm such a girl sometimes. alright, gotta pack.

       i'm not going to  intentionally be argumentative and mean spirited, but one part of our orientation irked me. now it was boring all the way through. (i really need an ipod) but i have an annoying habit of continuing to listen and hear every word that's said even if i'm not remotely interested. so one of the people who spoke to us was the head of the organization for minority students. i'm not trying to be bigoted, but that whole concept is a little skewed to me. she told us about the programs, both academic and financial, that are available to minority students. i think it's a good thing anytime someone can get some money for school. but should we really promote giving out assistance on the basis of color? now i know they say it's need based but you have to be poor and not white to recieve funding from this group. i feel like, as a white male, i am looked at as someone who has it easy and doesn't have to struggle. like i'm a part of the privileged few because of my skin tone. i do not have money. plain and simple. to me the minority issue is on the premise that minorities are disadvantaged. so logically i would be advantaged right? does that mean my college degree came easier? when they found out i was white they cut tuition in half? they graded my tests on a curve but not minorities? i have a problem with groups based on color. as long as you have people working to build up "black america" you will always have black america, and latino america, and asian america, and white america. separate and unequal. i don't think you can discriminate to have a positive impact and not have the negative.

       tammi is. she is a wonderful girlfriend. i got to see her a lot this weekend. she was actually the main reason i went to gainesville. the orientation was just an excuse really. now i don't know how we made it the whole summer apart. i don't know how i thought i had so much fun without her this summer. i was a little proud today to be sitting by her this morning when they asked all the grad assistants to raise their hands so she did. i liked it that she's smart and attractive. by the way, she looked so hot all weekend. we all know my tastes in girls is on the tall, thin, athletic side and she fits my "perfect woman" to a t. i couldn't ask for a better looking girl. seriously, she's hot and my best friend. that's a hard combo to find and if you find it, it's even tougher to convince that person to date you. i love her. she makes me happy.

       ....and i'm going back. gainesville was great. i realized how long it had really been since i've lived in an actual town. like, that has shops and stores along the streets. we don't have much of that in graceville or buies creek. i decided today that i can find pretty much anything i'll ever want within 20 minutes of my new apartment. this includes wal-mart, target, goodwill, a gas station, chick-fil-a, chipotle mexican grill, the campus, chilis, and then some. most of these are more like 5 minutes.   so the university of florida is big. gargantuan is a better word. 48,000 students. that started to sink in today. here's some numbers that i came across today in orientation and other sources. 24,000 undergrad applicants this year with 11,000 accepted. 10,000 grad students. about 2,100 grad faculty. an incoming freshman's average sat score is 1300. an sga budget of 3.8 million dollars. 15,000 people voted in the mayoral election in gainesville. 11,000 people voted in the sga elections. a 14,000 sq ft weight room in one of the gyms not including the 6,000 sq ft room of cardio equipment. my mind is sufficiently boggled by all of this after 6 years at very small schools. i'll just say i'm glad i didn't show up when i was 17 year old freshman left to fend for myself.    i'm stoked about my new apartment. i got to see it today. it's got everything. i'll give a full description when i move in thursday. i got my student id today. i look like i just woke up and i look stoned. it was sorority rush week. there is a sushi bar in the food court in the student center. i'm amazed continually.    so it looks like i'm going to enjoy my time at uf.

       that's right, will smith. the fresh prince. i know it sounds crazy but have you seen him lately? he's jacked. the dude is a monster. i read an article about his workout for i, robot in men's health and found out that he can bench 385lbs . 385 . that is absurd. i knew he'd gotten big but really. that's outrageous. he's so much cooler since i found that out. i benched 225 once. it's not the same, but i was impressed.

       i should be in bed right now. but i remembered i needed to wash clothes before tomorrow. i went to my grandparents today. i hadn't seen them since i got here. i mowed their grass and then swam in their pool. after that we went to the southern bbq here in graceville which is awesome.  later on i hung out with my friend jeff watkins who i haven't seen since may. we did typical stuff for graceville. we drove to dothan and went to books-a-million, waffle house, and wal-mart. (i got a 40 piece dish set for $10, my kind of living) it was good to see jeff. i definitely should have hung out with him more when i was in graceville. late is better than never though right?

       i'm not just saying that.      i really love newlyweds. why is that not out on dvd? i would buy it and watch an episode a day at least, which is already my current pattern. i'm also glad about the olympics. sports other than baseball in the summertime! i consider myself to be patriotic and am totally ok with blindly supporting athletes just because they wear the red, white, and blue. this is the only case where i support an underdog. with the exception of the olympics, i despise the underdog. i hope they lose every time. (unless it's the cowboys, gators, or spurs.....that's different) i believe the better team should always win and i don't think a cinderella story is sweet. i find those to be tragedies. the team that worked the hardest, had the most talent, and performed the best over the long run should always win. not the lucky punks who put together the best game of their life and could never repeat the effort. that's some kind of theft i think. that's what i hate about march madness. i love the fact that it's a month straight of basketball. i hate that it's a single elimination tourney so kentucky loses this year to uab on a fluke and i still think they were the best team in the country. at least uconn won. i'm still upset about syracuse beating kansas a couple of years ago. oh well. GO USA!

       "nope, we keep hitting it where they is" - so said the two old men behind me at the ballgame. i saw tammi today from noon til about midnight. it was so good to actually see her face when i talked to her instead of just having a voice on the phone. we went to byron's game and he pitched well and they won. his e.r.a. was hurt a little bit but that was partly due to lack of support in the field. thankfully it was over in 9 innings because i don't like baseball that much. actually i've decided i'd like baseball a lot if it was maybe a 6 inning game. it's the length + lack of action that causes me to dislike it. same with soccer. it's not the game itself that bores me, it's how long it lasts. thank God i'm not in a country where i have to watch all day cricket matches. i would like the timeouts for tea though. i got a syllabus for my sport finance class in my school e-mail that i just figured out how to check. lots of projects. i'm not worried yet, but maybe once school starts i will be. i also just realized today that i am moving to gainesville next week and i don't actually know where my apartment is located, where anything is on campus, or pretty much anything about the city. i move in next thursday and start class the following monday. guess i'd better learn quick. i'm pretty stoked about riding the bus for free though. i'm all for saving on gas in my car. i feel kind of like a kid starting kindergarten who gets to ride the bus for the first time. i can't wait.

       i've got to stop watching political talk shows before i go to bed every night. they get me fired up and pissed off and i'm way too healthy to have high blood pressure. did anybody catch the gov. mcgreevey stuff? gayness aside, the guys a derrrtty politician.          on a humorous note. those crazy koreans and their animals. a zookeeper in korea dressed up penguins and monkeys in korean jerseys in the spirit of the olympics. he said he did it because he wanted the animals to feel like they were a part of the olympic games. that is insane.

       every time i come home i realize there's not a whole lot going on here in graceville. it's quiet. all the people i went to school with here have since left for the most part. i've been spending some time with my sister and her friends the past couple of days. that's not a bad thing, just different. i always hung out with my brother more than my sister. i've also realized i'm a bad son. my mom broke her foot a couple of weeks ago so she's pretty much stuck at home. yesterday i hung out with one of the few people still here in graceville i'm friends with. today i met my sister for lunch and hung out with her and her friends. (we discussed politics, who'd have thought?) then we were invited bowling and were going to go but my mom sounded bummed about that. that's when i realized i'm not a very good son. i've barely seen my mom in the past three years and i've been gone a lot since i've been home. so i stayed here with her tonight. my sister stayed also. we watched tv shows i don't really like but my mom does. i should have done this more often.

       i have a possible solution to the "poverty" problem that is apparently plaguing our fair land. why not beef up our high school rotc programs and use it as a tool to show kids that there are good jobs in the military if they'll just join. we're currently offering outrageous bonuses for people to join the military because there are a shortage of people who are interested. we also have individuals stuck in a poverty cycle who do not think they can get a good job or go to college. what if we made a strong push to get kids to join rotc in high school? extracurriculars are always a good alternative to time on the street and this could be a really positive experience leading to a future job. we could introduce kids to the real world of following rules and orders of an authority in a protected environment. the military is actually a very good option for young people who don't know what they want to do. you are trained in a field that can usually translate into a civilian job and you have the opportunity to go to college with the military footing the bill. you are also in a secure job with benefits, including medical, dental, retirement, paid vacation, paid holidays, and an opportunity for advancement. it's also a structured envirnonment that underprivileged kids would be able to thrive in. the only requirements really are a high school diploma and for you to fall in line. for kids who don't see a point in going to school, what if they were shown how they could have a career, from anywhere from four to thirty years long, if they'll only complete high school. it helps solve the unemployment problem, it gives kids a decent future and gets them out of a potentially hazardous environment, and it helps fill the shortage the military has. i know this isn't a complete fix but couldn't this be a step to help a problem?

       why is laura bush being criticized? what has she done wrong? being silent is now a sin if you're female in america. silence does not equal ignorance. teresa heinz-kerry is being lauded for a woman who speaks her mind and is a ceo and is a strong woman. first, it takes nothing to speak your mind. restraint takes strength of character. mrs. heinz-kerry has shown to have trouble restraining her tongue when pressured, but all of a sudden that shows she is strong? i always thought a person of true strength didn't have to tell anyone. mrs. bush has supported her husband, the presidential candidate. his name is on the ballot, he should be doing the talking right? i'm not bothered by mrs. heinz-kerry because i really don't think that the spouse of a candidate means anything important to the election. i'm just saying lay off of laura bush for being a strong woman and a lady who supports her husband.

       my thoughts on the war in iraq and why bush was right.       1. the war was justified. all of our intelligence reports said that iraq was a threat to homeland security. bush agreed. the congress said iraq was a threat.  john kerry  said iraq was a threat. (last night in unlv he said that he has never changed positions on the war, a lie, and that he supported and still supports it so if you're anti-war i guess you're anti-kerry). the u.n. council said that iraq was a threat. that pretty much covers all angles i'd guess. so iraq was a threat. everyone's in agreement.       2. diplomacy was no longer an option. the criticisms against bush are that he did not use diplomatic measures to prevent a war. i think 10 years of hussein ignoring the peace agreement he made at the end of desert storm is a worthy attempt at negotiation. have we forgotten that saddam made a treaty and defied it for 10 years? that alone is grounds for renewing war. also he shot at american planes during that ten years. that would be in my mind a direct threat toward america. also, saddam is not exactly a reasonable national leader. he is a tyrant with no regard for diplomacy. further negotiation was not an option.  on a sidenote, i find it interesting that michael moore's allegation that bush's failure to read a memo is reason to actually say that bush caused the terror attack. (ted kennedy made this same allegation recently. why is this not the top story on every news station? a top senator blaming his own president for a terror attack on our country? maybe because the press is on his side.) if a memo is enough information to act, then how are intelligence reports in our own country and from the u.n. that indicate a threat not good enough reason to be pro-active? and if we're going to blame a politician for the twin towers, consider bill clinton and his lack of leadership when the u.s.s. cole was bombed. intelligence reports said al qaeda was responsible, and pakistan offered bin laden to us for capture and clinton failed to act. place blame where it truly lies. this is also a good example of inaction and the consequences.       3. the troops must stay longer. kerry is saying he will have our troops back within six months. how is that possible if iraq is to have any kind of stable government? if kerry honestly believes the war was justified, and he says he does, we have to finish what we started. we owe it to the iraqi people to have a military presence there to keep some kind of order until they can function on their own. there is no way this can happen in six months. if kerry thinks this is true, he is truly too ignorant to lead our military in any capacity. war hero in vietnam thinks this is a short-lived undertaking? ludicrous. again, if we want to talk about the injustices toward our soldiers by the government, let's again go back to bill clinton. he left our soldiers in bosnia for several years. they were there for a u.n. peacekeeping mission. that's  u.n.  bosnia posed no threat at all in any way to america but somehow it was imperative for our soldiers to be their policemen? this was abuse of power. if we are in an age in america when we believe it is more important to support u.n. missions than our own safety we have lost the spirit this country was built on.      4. bottom line, kerry is making promises he can't come through on. he could not and would not have negotiated a peaceful agreement with iraq. bringing our troops home early would be wrong. we do not need world support to protect our borders (again, it is wholly agreed upon that our country was threatened). we had no choice but to go to war with iraq or else wait for the next terror attack on america. we've started it, we've got to finish it. it's only right.

       so i think bush is better for the economy than kerry. first of all,  kerry's robin hood rhetoric of stealing from the rich to give to the poor is in its very essence anti-american. we are a capitalist nation and believe in free enterprise. kerry wants to raise the minimum wage. that will not help. all that will do is raise the prices of everything else keeping the ratio even where it is today. bush supports a welfare program that does not penalize someone for saving money, owning a home, or getting married as the current system does. this is true. because i worked through (the first three years) college i was not eligible for the pell grant, a need based grant. i made $10,000 a year and paid all my own bills including college tuition without any loans. however i have friends who lived in government housing where they were paid a monthly check to live there and were given pell grants which paid their tuition as well as enough for them to live. i was penalized for working. by increasing welfare spending we will be perpeuating the welfare cycle. no one can deny the existence of a welfare cycle. people generally stay on welfare. this does not help the poor. (the government is not even obligated to support the poor but that is an entirely different argument) kerry wants to tax the rich more than the rest of us. penalizing success does not promote progress. it is not the american way. bush supports tax relief for married people, as well as people who own homes, and he also promotes  voluntary  choice in social security. he also is in support of the opportunity for small business' to pool their resources so they can afford to provide healthcare for their employees. small business' are the largest growing employer in america. kerry wants to use government money to support healthcare and the poor. this will have to mean increased taxes. the main thing is that our money is spent by us, the citizens and not the government. increasing government spending takes control away from the people. this is socialism. the government's main purpose in america is to protect our freedom not financially support us. kerry will not protect us and he will continue to lead us in a downward economic spiral. also, remember that the economy is on the upswing. the national unemployment rate is 5.5%. we are doing well as a country.

       i am an argumentative individual. i understand that and nobody is surprised by that. i think there needs to be a little explanation though. this is normal in my house. my brother and father and i have candidly debated issues such as theology, politics, sports, beef vs. chicken, jiffy vs skippy peanut butter and virtually everything else you could imagine. we  like  to argue. it's almost a hobby and was the norm at the dinner table til my mom couldn't take it anymore. i will passionately debate anything. this does not mean i am angry however and that's what i believe people think a lot. i just am stubborn and pig-headed and don't give up. also, my father is a minister and has always been deeply interested in politics which he passed on to micah and i. so controversy is the norm to the fries'. we actually like it. since i was homeschooled my parents were always involved in education policies because they directly affected us. i have been in political rallies and protests and the like since grade school. i thought every 8 year old kid watched the news before bed. free will vs. unconditional election was a hot topic in middle school in my house. the rights and wrongs of church programs and traditions were always discussed along with things like abortion and the welfare state. my dad has helped start programs for unwed mothers and is heavily involved with social minstry. this is the way we were raised. i though everybody kept up on politics. so, i'm not really mean, just opinionated. i had to be to join in around the table.

       of the comment window. all the ads for different web-sites. i used to ignore them but now they're starting to fascinate me.  urlLink this is the newest one    i have a feeling i would have a lot of issues with this movie. especially the statement that jesus christ is not referenced by non-christian scholars. that's because he was an obscure carpenter and he was killed like a common criminal. if a write did not believe he is  the son of God then he wouldn't get a mention. i need to learn about this i think.

       i'm back in the so-called sunshine state. all it's done is rain. i looked at the 10 day forecast and it says rain every day except maybe tuesday. there's a tropical storm that's supposed to be here thursday and another behind it. all i want is to go to the beach one day. ONE day. no rain. just me and the sun and the gulf of mexico and crystal clear 85 degree water and white sugar sand. but it looks like i won't get what i came home for. this could mean an entire summer, no beach. depressing.

       so i saw him today. from like, 50 feet away and even as close as about 25 feet. political parties aside, it was really cool to be that close to the leader of the free world. that's more about the position than the man. so, we got there at like 3 in the afternoon and stuff started happening around 4. it was on the pier by the marina in panama city. it rained for like the first 45 minutes we were there and that sucked. there was something like 23,000 people there. j.c. watts was there introducing everybody which was very cool to me. not only was he a football player at oklahoma (or osu i don't really remember which one) but i have a lot of respect for him as a politician. then a bunch of state people spoke. after that we had to endure 30 minutes of aaron tippin singing. it sucks that kerry gets all the good bands. finally the prez showed up with all of the campaign buses. jeb, our governor and his brother, introduced him as well as john mckain. he spoke for about 40 minutes. i thought it was a good speech of course. i was impressed by the turnout and it looks good for a bush win in fl this fall. he definitely has the panhandle. mostly i was just stoked to be that close to a president. i've seen bush sr. and dan quayle when they flew into langley afb, but that was from a distance. this was close. i'm feeling very political right now, and could go into why bush is good for the economy, why the war was a good thing, how kerry will give too much control to the government and turn us into a southern annex of canada but i won't. i enjoyed the rally. that's all.  W in '04.

      when i was commenting on  urlLink tim jenkin's blog  there was an ad at the bottom of the haloscan window that said " urlLink muslims for nader ". odd. on that site there is a comment from a guy who has the site " urlLink communistsforkerry  ". this makes much more sense.

       for those dying to know, and because i now love lists, while driving i made a list (in order  of appearance) of the cd's i listened to today. yes, i was writing while driving at the same time and some times talking on the phone as well. i am foolish.       1. brand new - deja entendu   2. brand new - my favorite weapon          (some repeated songs)   3. bela fleck and the flecktones - a live cd, disc 1   4. coheed and cambria - the second stage turbine blade    5. dave matthews band - the central park concert, all 3 discs   6. dashboard confessional - a mark, a mission, a brand, a scar   7. bright eyes - lifted (or the story is in the soil. keep your ear to the ground)   8. dashboard confessional - so impossible ep   9. o.a.r. - the wanderer   10. the o.c. supertones - the live album   11. rich mullins - songs      (he's more brilliant every time)   12. the postal service - give up   13. r.e.m. - automatic for the people   14. the appleseed cast - low level owl: vol 1

       graceville, fl.....where the living is easy. that's what the sign on the edge of town says and i like it. i am home at last. instead of writing about it, i've decided i like lists so i'm making a list of random thoughts and sights throughout today.      1. i left dekalb, mo (pop. 257 again since i'm gone) at 8 am and arrive in graceville, fl at 11:30 pm, a new record.....you do the math.   2. right over the illinois border there is larry flynt's hustler club. weird.   3. every time i drive through illinois i'm surprised again to see oil wells. it's pretty much just corn besides that.    4. i got some pictures of bush stadium and the arch (like i need more) while driving on i-64. dangerous.   5. i contemplate getting off the interstate in stl to take a picture of the courtesy diner but decide a trip of this magnitude needs no delays.   6. my other mirror is intact still and everything else that wasn't already broken is also.   7. after stl. i only stop every 250 miles.....i need a bigger gas tank.    8. i missed the signs for the "boobie bungalow" in tenn. they always make me laugh.    9. there are a lot more W. stickers in the south.    10. my car is infinitely cooler with a bike rack and bike on the trunk.....i like to think it changes my image from a guy who drives a car with a broken mirror and dented front fender to a guy who eschews materialism and seeks adventure.....i hope it's true.   11. kentucky is cool.   12. tennessee is pretty.    13. alabama is different.    14. illinois is none of the above.    15. wendys is way better than macdonalds.   16. my car does not have enough horsepower.   17. i was most tired from 8-12 am.   18. i am wide awake now and am writing on my blog instead of going to bed after a long drive.    19. ^i'm stupid.   20. i realized i really love good ol dixie.   21. my dad told me the door was unlocked and my bed was made......when i got here and tried the door, it was locked......was that a hint?   22. my parents took the tv out of my room and put it in theirs.   23. the best part about being back in the south is never having to hear anyone refer to coke as "pop"   24. i took a really neat picture of a toy ninja that is on my dashboard.   25. i found out i have text messaging for free til october.    26. i have not shaved since thursday   27. i talked on the phone more today than i ever have in one day i think   28. tim jenkins did not answer his phone or call me back.   29. i am going to a rally in panama city tomorrow to see the president. i'm happy about that.   30. i love florida.

       this was my last day in missouri. round two is over. i liked it living here this time as much as i did back in high school. the job wasn't anything spectacular but the money was good. i'm glad i got to spend a summer with my brother and his family. i don't see them much and who knows when i'll see them again. christmas i guess. i'm heading home though and i'm really liking the sound of that. home. a place i've only visited really for the past six years. i'll get to see my parents, sister, grandparents, aunts and uncle, and cousin. that part is nice.  and the beach! i'm going to panama city and i'm going to lay there all day enjoying the sand and the sun. i'm starting to realize the epic drive i'm undertaking tomorrow. by the time it's over i'll have driven through missouri, illinois, indiana, kentucky, tennessee, alabama, and finally florida. i hope i make it. let's hope the saturn makes it too. so long midwest. farewell.

       packing. i don't want to do it. i am leaving to drive home tomorrow and it's 4:30 and i'm just now washing clothes so i can begin to pack. i also have to get to bed early because i've decided a hotel is not worth the money and i'm driving straight through. that's about 1,050 miles folks, which is something like 16-18 hours. a long friggin drive. but i'm dreading the packing more. because i have moved residences somewhere around 25 times i despise the act of moving. it's right up there with filling out forms and applications. i'm a procrastinator by nature.       the drive is going to be so long. thankfully i will have about 300 cd's to keep me company. this is the perfect setting to listen to the dave mathews' band central park concert in it's entirety straight through. also, if i have your cell phone number you might be hearing from me.

       it's what i do now. my brother and his buddies (the entire staff of his church by the way) all have an affinity for cigars. i don't smoke but because they're all doing it i joined in. it was only micah and jon and i tonight because nick had to be with his wife, so he said. this is my second cigar of the summer and ever for that matter. it's not bad. it's not great either. something i can take or leave. i put it kind of on the same level as beer. the rum and diet dr. pepper i had with it is another matter. i love that stuff. i've developed many vices since last fall. i'm almost forgetting the days of being homeschooled.       tim jenkins likes that song "get out" by teen sensation  urlLink jojo . that is absurd.      any one who reads the entire entry i wrote about mine and  urlLink tim jenkins'     trip   deserves a prize. it is so long it's ridiculous.

       somewhere in one of the conversations with  urlLink tim jenkins    i mentioned how dissapointed i was that no one had made any comments regarding the "don't vaccinate pregnant bitches" title on one of my posts. i thought that this was one of the funniest things i'd ever read. tim told me he thought i'd made it up and i said no, it was on the package of the vaccine for the dogs. i was quoting that. tim then said this changed it entirely and it was indeed hilarious. he thinks i should have made that more clear. so now i'm doing that. this is straight from a warning on a doggie drug package. laugh away freely now and comment on the hilarity of the statement.

        i had to do a little re-arranging of my class schedule yesterday because one of my classes got cancelled. there were only two classes i could take that don't conflict with my other classes. one of those was closed, leaving only one option, sport ethics. now i really wanted to take this class but didn't like the time. so now i have a grand total of three classes, 9 hours, and yet still i'll  be going to class monday-friday. ONE class a day. one. every day. very unfortunate. and mwf class starts at like 8, my one class those days, at 8. i thought grad school was going to be fun.

       it's saturday now. i slept very late today to recover. this week was the most exhausting, 4 day, in state (mostly) vacation i've had in my entire life. the days were so long somehow, especially that first one of like 28 hours. now, i must attempt to try to recap whatever i've left out. I have a lot of catching up to do with  urlLink tim . he has all kind of posts about our trip and i have like two. this is the reason. have you seen the length of his posts?? those don't happen in 10 minutes kids. i laid on the bed in the hotel room for what seemed like eternity flipping through channels waiting for my turn. that is why i happened to find micahael moore on tv every night (an atrocity, since he is a proven liar and not a credible source) which led to all the whining that bugged tim but he could have avoided it by letting me go first and then i would have missed all the talk shows with m.m. on them and would have just watched new jack city and the like while he typed. so this is why i'm behind. also, why does hbo not have anything good on at night? crappy movie after crappy movie every night.it sucked. however we had talked about new jack city in a previous argument and then it came on tv, which was cool. this happened a lot during the week.       so here starts the retelling if i can remember everything. it may not be in the order that these events occurred but more in the order they come to my mind. back to wednesday. we stopped at some outlets and i bought a tie. if you know me you know how big of a change this was for me. i also got flip flops for $4. tim bought a black dress shirt with white stripes the likes of which i've wanted for a long time, but they didn't have my size. i'm jealous of him. we did eat at hardees and had the most polite fast food kid ever. he genuinely seemed to enjoy his job. strange. he gave us free cookies because they put cheese on my burger which i don't eat.       thursday, we did walk around kc forever. it is not nearly as interesting as stl. the problem is i don't actually live in kc, but 30 minutes north of it, so i don't really know my way around there or what's interesting. so we went to the plaza (trendy shopping place) and walked all over from there. kc is the fountain city. they love those things here. i've heard that there are more fountains in kc than any other city in the world besides rome. take that stl. stl does have the nijinski hare though, the scary bunny. speaking of bunnies we saw a rabbit outside of a tennis complex and i tried to take a picture of it but tim walked in front of me so it was all him, no rabbit. he did this a lot over the course of the trip. i think he has some sort of entitlement issue because his camera is infinitely better than mine. that led to me calling him a lot of unsavory names.      we walked forever trying to find a non-chain place to eat. we found a few local eateries but their menus sucked so we continued walking. after tim declares he doesn't want pizze, he sees a place called joe's pizza and says we should eat there. it was contradictory, but i like pizza so it was cool. while at joes we discovered it was 5:30 and not lunch time. this was disconcerting because we'd only been up a few hours. after we left we passed a hippie homeless band in a little grassy area and avioded them so we wouldn't have to give them any money. one bum did score some change from us though, because he was clever. he asked if we had any change that he could have because he was trying to make a down payment on a cheese burger. that's a funny bum.      several blocks up the road we saw a huge line of teenage girls and a van from 93.3, the local crappy top 40 station. we naturally assumed that it was some sort of show and we were right. we weren't prepared for the name on the marquee though. it was hanson. we took pictures of the marquee that also had  david byrne on it, which is a show i would love to go to. there were so many fans. it was absurd. the last time hanson was popular i lived in kc. we realized that anyone in the crowd who was 14 would've been 6 when mmmmmbop came out, so that means they were second wave hanson fans, which is very lame. further up the road there was a life insurance building with big concrete lions outside that we took pictures with to continue the "me and tim with big stone cats" series that began in stl with stone bears.       we went into a world market at some point in my attempt to find a bathroom and tim bought water and i bought french limonade. neither of us wanted the contents of our respective bottles really, just the bottles. that's how we roll.      we continued back to the plaza area and went down by the canal and took more pictures. we took pictures of a weird cow in front of a hotel and there were these valet guys playing a game with quarters in the driveway. i don't really know what the game was about but you do get penalized if your quarter goes in the street. sometime walking around kc i decided that i need a roadbike for gainesville and also a scooter. that would be so much fun to ride around and so cheap. i'm getting one.      after the plaza we drove towards the historic jazz district i've always heard about in kc. there's a jazz museum there and a negro league baseball museum and it's supposed to be cool. it wasn't. and it's only a couple blocks from troost ave. which is not a good thing i hear. so we kept driving. we wound up at a bbq place, because i told tim he nedded to eat real bbq not the nc stuff, but it was no longer serving food so we instead got drinks from the bar and listened to open mic night. while we were there we tim said bands should never open or close with covers unless they're a cover band. i'm fine with that, but i said if a band is really not that good i'd rather hear a bad cover of a song i can sing along with and enjoy than a crappy original song i don't know. i gave the example of how a bad hootie and the blowfish rendition can be more enjoyable than a song i don't know that equally sucks. later when we were at tomfooleries, again it was open mic night and they did a hootie and the blowfish cover. i smiled. tomfooleries was a great place. i had a guinness there which has been on my to-do list and is now "my" beer. i don't like beer, and dislike them equally pretty much but i decided if i were to drink beer i would be a snob about it and stick with guinness. mostly because i like old guinness signs. while we're sitting there tim goes to the bathroom and is gone for like 20 minutes. he comes back and says his zipper broke so he is now wearing boxers backwards for obvious reasons. it's really sad about the shorts. not only does tim like the shorts, but those particular shorts he purchased on a dare. at the mall in raleigh once, he told word and myself they don't make shorts in his size in the mall. we were determined to prove him wrong and those shorts were the result. (that night also got tim a call from a couple of unknown high school girls courtesy of word and myself) we left the guy a $9 tip which more than covers the glass i took and am currently drinking out of. i love this glass.       we headed to wal-mart for some new shorts and i got a really ugly truckers hat with yellow mesh, an orange brim, and white front that says jared's (my real name) guitar service new york, new york on it. a high quality $4 find. then it was off to the casino. at the argosy we promptly lost all our money. freezer -$20  tim - $40. and then we couldn't get out. we walked all around that place a couple of times before we finally found the exit. it's a good thing there aren't casinos in nc because tim jenkins would be a very poor man.       friday was uneventful except for a car ride. tim is right. i'm a very poor driver. on the interstate a dump truck was getting off and going like thrity miles an hour so i was going to switch lanes so i check the mirrors, look back, and then go. and bam, there's a car right beside me and now my left side mirror is dangling. he kept right on rolling though so i don't think he even noticed. i have no idea where he came from. tim i accept responsibiliy but i really don't know where he came from. i'm now scared of shiny black cars. i tried to fix it with epoxy from wal-mart but it didn't go so well. after some lunch and time-killing i dropped tim off at the airport. on the way to work i realized i'd never properly said thanks to tim for the trip so i called him back, proclaimed myself a jerk and said thank you. then it was time for work. i saw a priest in the bar at work in full priest get-up. funny. now, though work is over and i'm unemployed. it's nice.      so the vacation has come to an end and so, quickly is my time here in mo. tim, i loved it. sorry for whining, it's what i do. i'll work on that. the driving probably can't be helped. it's a lost cause. thanks for coming out here. i had a great time. let's do it again in gainesville. we'll eat at long john silvers, inside that time. thanks for the good times past, present, and future.

      so, i don't have enough time to do justice to the events of yesterday because we have to check out in less than an hour and i haven't showered or packed. also, i'm trying to add a class for the fall since i found out that one of my classes was cancelled and i need another one. i can't get it to work though and it's pissing me off. i did find out that i can get season tickets to the football games for $46.

      it's almost 3 pm and we have only been up for like an hour and a half. we would still be sleeping, but tim set an alarm for 1 and that woke us up. we went to bed sometime around 6 am this morning. we decided at 4am to take the car back and drop it off instead of going to bed and sleeping only like 4 hours. we had a little difficulty getting there, but we made it back and on the way back to the hotel we caught the beginnings of rush hour as everyone was going to work and we were trying to just get to bed.  yesterday was busy. we stayed in our hotel til 12 when we had to leave. then we walked around downtown stl for about 5 hours. we took pictures of everything pretty much including a dead squirrel and a homeless guy taking a nap on the steps of an opera house. he seemed irritated by us waking him up while we took pictures with a bear statue. we soon found out walking around, that what took us about 20 minutes to drive around at 2am looking for food was only like an 8 block square. i still think stl is haunted and that it gets bigger at night. we saw a scary rabbit statue and so much more. we walked to the arch and of course did not go up. tim was scared and i thought it would take too long. but we did take lots of pictures. then i thought i'd lost my wallet and was in a panic for a while til we got back to the car and found out it was in my backpack. we payed the guy in the parking garage with 24 quarters. he seemed entertained. on the way back we stopped for gas sometime after dark and tim says lets put the top down. it looked a little cloudy but tim assured me that as long as you keep moving you don't get wet in the rain. so there we went topless and it started raining. and we were getting wet. tim is a liar. we had to stop and put the top up real quick looking like idiots in the rain. that is tim's fault. when we checked into the courtyard we soon came back to reality. we were no longer kings living large. we were plain guys in a not so impressive hotel room. oh well. in the past few days we've driven across MO twice, been to illinois and to kansas. who knows what today holds? if only i could remember all the witty things we said this post would be so much better.

      it is after 3 am on thursday morning and i am on the internet for the first time since tuesday morning. so much has happened since i left dekalb at 9 am on tuesday. i can't even begin to describe it and i a'm too tired to go into detail so i'm going with a list of all the highlights with minimal description.  -tim's flight is delayed  -we pick up our new ride, the mustang......and then i drive for too long with the parking brake on  -somewhere along i-70, not paying attention to our lane ending, decide against racing ahead of a semi and  choose instead to go from 75-0 and come to a complete stop on the interstate  -the stunna and i argue loud and long over many topics, mostly of a political nature  -tim farts a lot, those who know him know it's not pleasant  -we once again come to a complete stop on the intersate in stl to put the top down    -we drive around our hotel several times looking for the parking garage  -we check in and the opulence of the next 24 hours is celebrated with rum, dr. pepper, and oatmeal cream  pies  -on the way to the game we take pictures of a lambourhini diablo that was for sale outside of the hotel next to ours  -frsehly showered we go to the cards game....i decide so taguchi is my new favorite baseball player....so taguchi drops an out that can end the game....instead the cards lose 10-6 off of an expos grand slam in the 12......5 hours after we got there we leave busch stadium, i don't know what i did to deserve this, i'm not a baseball fan remember....while at the game we become acquainted with the "left field bleachers" crowd, they are loud, have 10 rules (printed on t-shirts), and are led by a cantankerous old woman and her sidekick silent bob.....some rules are, no cell phones-the game is on, we don't do the wave, and no dresses, skirts, or panythose-they belong in the stadium club.....our fearless leader has lots of chants my favorite one being "3up 3down 3up 3down 3up 3down, let it be said, let it be done, so says the preacher, so says the flock-this was a good one.....we are a few rows behind a couple of young teenage girls who break the no skirts rule along with some other unspoken societal no-nos  -after walking back to the hotel and taking pictures we venture across the river to illinois to the casino queen and promptly come out $24 richer between the two of us  -we are hungry and drive around stl looking for some place that is open at 2 am to spend our spoils.....we pass by the devil's cathedral (the mayor stays here) and i proclaim st. louis a haunted town.....we ask a cop for a place to eat and he gives us directions to the courtesy diner, and we had the meal of kings and debated on leaving the waitress $13 in quarters but decide against it and instead pay for parking with it at the arch on wednesday  -now full and satisfied we go back to the hotel and climb into our (separate) beds and enjoy the sleep of kings  today's happenings will have to wait til tomorrow. i can't keep my eyes open.

       it has begun! the vacation has started and i should be in bed. but i'm not. and i still have to pack. i'm such a procrastinator. this week is going to be so good. i'm excited. and we'll have internet access in our hotel so the posts won't stop. speaking of posts, i am way excited about the hit counter on here now. i now know that since i went to bed last night there have been 40 hits on my blog. this makes my head swell along with comments by two people i don't even know. awesome. life is so good.

       i take back what i previously said about the military guys. let me explain. saturday night and tonight changed my opinion. yes it is true that they don't order much, they order cheap stuff, and they don't really leave big tips, but this is ok. i've noticed when i'm taking their orders to them they seem to thoroughly enjoy getting room service. you can tell they're not used to something like this so food brought straight to their hotel room is "cool". there is something i really admire about grown men being so easily satisfied. so different than people who stay there every week who barely stop their cell phone conversations long enough to sign and add their generous tip. it's sad really to live a life of somewhat luxury that it no longer is interesting. i know it's common to make fun of the whole "country boy sees the city for the first time" type of person. but tomorrow i'll be that guy when tim jenkins and i stay in a renaissance grand that we could never afford without my employee discount while driving our rented mustang that is equally out of reach. i'm glad i can't afford it because i know i will soak it all up these few days and enjoy it. even if i get to the point where i can afford a lifestyle i'm not used to right now, i hope it never becomes status quo. thanks to the military guys for unknowingly pointing out to me how terrible i was for looking at people and determining their worth by what they put in my pocket. i apologize.

       i don't really have anything to say. really, nothing of interest or importance. i've been going so strong though it would just feel wrong to go to bed without a post. nothing's coming to mind but i'll give it a try anyway. i put a counter on my site wednesday this week. i enjoy checking that. i'm almost at 100 hits. not bad. the comments are going downhill though. i must no longer be interesting at all. i think the controversial topics have turned people away. that is no good. i'll stick to safe things for a while. like, it's august. so many things start this month. i go home, i move to gainesville, i see tammi again, i start grad school. i get a new job (hopefully). this month will have a huge impact it seems.     long distance relationships suck. only two more weeks of it thankfully. the phone is my best friend now and i hate it for it. oh, i took a platinum gift to the dean emeritus of penn state last night. not really a celebrity, but i was impressed. plus he gave me 20 bucks. well, i'm done. this post is devoid of anything mildly entertaining but it had to be done. goodnight.         i really love vanilla tea

       i was talking to my friend jeff the other day and i mentioned degarmo & key. they're a christian rock band from the 80's. they are the greatest rock band ever in my opinion. oh, i know that virtually the entire world will disagree, but they are the pinnacle of rock in my world. i still have several of their tapes. one of the biggest days of my childhood was when my grandparents, not knowing who they were, gave me the pledge album for my birthday. boycott hell was tops on that album. another fond memory is when my mom, again not knowing they were "rock", bought my brother and i each our own copy of d & k. out of the danger zone is such a good song. i know petra was more popular at the time and whiteheart was big as well, but they all took a backseat to d&amp;k. this was rebellious for me. again i was homeschooled. they even had their video, six, six, six, banned from mtv because the devil burned up in it. i could go on but i won't. degarmo and key, you are awesome.                  ert, mobb boss needs to cover one of their songs.....i'd buy another dvd

       so i'm getting both spiderman 2 and anchorman on dvd next week. how you ask? i've got a guy. that's all i'm gonna say. now, the quality is not the highest but it's worth it for the early viewing pleasure you know? now, i know bootleg copies of movies aren't on the up and up, but here's how i've rationalized it in my head. i went to both of these movies and plan on buying the legit dvd's when they come out. so i've done my part supporting these films. i'm just terribly impatient. i thought of getting farenheit 9/11 too because i don't want to go see it in theaters because i very much dislike michael moore and refuse to give him money. if i got the bootleg though i would actually be stealing from him, which is a very tempting proposition. i think i'll let it slide though. as an aside but still related thought, i've been operating all summer without a liquor license. in mo you have to have a liquor license to serve alcohol, but since i'm only here a few months i took my boss' suggestion and saved myself $30 by not getting one. it makes me feel a little dangerous. i know that's kind of lame, but i was homeschooled so this is wild for me.
