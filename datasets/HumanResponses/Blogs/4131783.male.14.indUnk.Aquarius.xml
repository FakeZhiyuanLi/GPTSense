      Firstly all five of my Black Tulips have sprouted. Not that it's a big thing, but it's pretty cool.  After writing about my cat I have to say that everyone seems to have really interesting and unique pets. (But only my pet has a Blog article about them.) I'm sure other people have other ideas about this too but pets play a really big part in our lives. I can't imagine life without pets or plants for that matter. Maybe it's because I've spent most of my life in the bush but I really appreciate pets and plants. It's just something about them that is really cool and special. I can't explain what it is but hopefully someone else can. I'll have a think about it and hopefully write again.

      Cats are wonderful and gorgeous. I love them and they are fantastic and fun and one of the best animals in the world. Most cats are anyway. I think my Blog has reached the stage in its life where I introduce my cat... Pepe.  To be technically corect Pepe is my mums cat actually. We got him two years ago from a women who catches stray cats at the Melbourne University. She bought him in to the veterinary surgery where my mum works as a vet nurse and it was love at first sight. Well she loved him at first sight and when she had cleared all the gunk and God Knows What out of his eyes and he could see he loved her too. He was a very very sick puudy cat. The people at Melb Uni didn't even have to catch him, he was just lying there dying. He had many chronic diseases and was supposedly going to die. But even as he lay there at the surgery he was purring. The vet told my mum NOT to take him home as he would just die. Well she took him home anyway and that is how he has come from being a terrified street cat who was going to die and was scared of everything to a confident gluttinous couch potato who sits in the window sill all day.  Pepe is one of the cutest cats in the world. He is very old and not fat, just big boned. He is a long haired black and white cat and the hair on his face makes his face look big. While he was a street cat he was hit by a car and his jaw is slightly disfigured, not noticably but it makes his tounge hang out so you alwys see the tip of it. His whiskers are really really long. He also has whiskers on his eyebrows that make him look very wise and fur in his ears. The fur between his claws is really long and his feet are dappled. His purr is really loud even when his not purring because he can't breathe properly. Nethertheless he eats heaps and enjoys running as fast as he can through the house and trying to stop as fast as he can. He's a great eater and runner. He sleeps for most of the day and spends most of the night running around and hurting himself, sleeping or eating. He used to try and jump up on the bed but he was alot heavier so he would fall down. He is much more careful now. He hits all the walls because we have tiled floors and his 'big bones' propell him into them despite his best efforts to slip and slide around.  His tendancies are the most peculiar thing though. When he wants a pat which is always he reaches out with his paws and gently taps you. It is the cutest thing ever! It has evolved with strict discipline on my mums behalf from a wallop to a gentle tap. He occasionly hits you really hard though and sometimes he bites you on the nose with his few remaining teeth. He is also very peticular about his food and will actually only eat the really expensive fish food. He also goes throughmoods. One moment he will be really quiet cuddly the next he will be really energetic and playful. He playing generally involves rolling around on the floor or hitting pens and papers of tables. The hitting of pens and papers off tables usually coincides with the trying to study of my mum and I.  This brings me to the actual point of the article. Someone has recently invented software for your computer that can tell when there is a cat walking across your keyboard. I hope it sets of an alarm or something because Pepe can be really annoying. As I sit and write on my Blog he sits and purrs next to me on the desk. Then he tentatively reaches out and taps me on the shoulder so i am forced to pat him. This process goes on for a while till he gets board and cleans himself. Then he hits me again and knowing that i am really busy I force myself to keep typing. So Pepe headbuts me and tries to wipe his slobbery mouth over me which I hate. That still doesn't work so he walks in front of me and begins trampling on the keyboard. It's really annoying but I still love him heaps. He can be really really really demanding. He is so happy now though and he loves my mum so much. When she is home he rarely comes to me and no one would believe that our cat now is the same cat he used to be. All though he can be really demanding my mum and I both love him heaps.  The End.  There is heaps and heaps more to my cat and lots more stories so I will write more soon.

       Should there be restrictions on the media for the personal privacy of celebrities?   I agree and disagree with the topic. Celebrities should have the basic human right of privacy but I don't think it should be as strict as for other citizens. To start with a celebrities occupation is often as an actor or singer. These people appear on movie screens and different mediums and are known to almost everyone in the world so on that level they are not very private. It's there job to be public. Also the way the current media is most people know everything about them and I mean everything. Alot of magazines have very trivial knowledge about celebrities which in a way throws privacy out the window. The current state of the media's priveleges regarding celebrities is not the topic though.  I also think that the media works in both ways for celebrities. A celebrity will often want to have photos taken when they are doing something important or glamorous. It is a bit unfair to have the media be able to take photos at some times and then not at others. It is also in a way slightly unfair to the people. Many people completely adore celebrities and want to know about them. They want all the gossip and details not just waht the celebrities want them to see. I don't think it can work both ways. The media is part of what makes a celebrity. The celebrities should have complete privacy like other citizens or complete publicity and be subject to the photos they are currently subject to. The real question is whether celebrities would rather have stricter restrictions on the media regarding their privacy. Surely if they did then there would be some way they could stop the pictures. I'll have to email them and see.   Are the Olympics pointless?   I really wanted to talk about the olympics as something about them was one of my questions that we could choose in class was about them. I don't really have that much to say though. I was initially against the olympics and such thought they were pointless. I have not watched any of the events but I have seen the headlines and news about them and I have been slightly swung over.  To start with I disagree with the funding. It's not that the funding goes to sport it's that it goes to one or few individual people. Alot of money is put into a few people whereas I think that money could be better used on a large number of people. The other bad thing about the olympics is to do with the medal tally. It is said that the best way to predict the medal tally without the team size of a country is through the wealth of a country or the amount of money they put into training people not the size of the country. This makes sense if you consider the fact that countries like America, Australia and China are all quite high on the medal tally whereas countries like India that have quite large populations and are quite poor are hardly on the medal tally. This also has to do with the Olympics being quite unfair because of the funding. You don't get to see the true ability of a country.  There are many good sides to the olympics as well though. To start with the country who hosts them can often make alot of money through tourism and other countries can make money through broadcasting the olympics. Except for an Indonesian television company who last olympics broadcast the olympics and nobody watched them. They lost lots of money. The Olympics also encourage patriotism and give young people something to aspire to. They are also enjoyable (for most people) to watch. There are many many other reasons like this but I think one of the biggest is the uniting force they have. Everyone seems really supportive and happy about the olympics. It also gives people something in common to talk about.  For all of these reasons I don't think the Olympics are pointless but I don't think there is that much of a point to them.

      I am personally really enjoying the blog project. It's great having a small enclosed digital environment of just 8s but then having so many more blogs in the 'real world' as Zoe put it. I have just begun looking at and posting comments on everyones blogs. While I've been posting comments on peoples blogs it sometimes feels like I'm talking behind someones back. This is when I'm talking about someone other than the person whose blog I am commenting on. It's quite disconcerting and I am hereby resolving to try and not do that as much as possible. Or failing that at least tell the person that I was talking about what was said, not that it's ever bad. This all may be just because all the blogs are only recently set up so theres not that much discussion going on. Nether the less I shall try not to talk about people unless I tell them what was said even though it's not being mean because it's nothing bad.  Also. Is there Blog Etiquette and if so where can I get a copy or find out about it. As Zoe was saying, with the Internet establishing so quickly the whole digital citizenship has been skipped and I think this applies to etiquette as well. I have never really used blogs or anything like them before and I am unsure of the proper etiquette surrounding such matters. In particular I would like to know about talking to or asking questions of someone on another persons blog. i.e If they have written a comment and you want to respond to that comment but that comment is on someone else’s blog. What do you do???

      I have to think that blogs are worthwile. If not worthwhile then definately interesting. Reading some of the blogs i can't help but notice that alot of the posts being published and conversations going on are a lot like the things peolpe used to talk about in computer classes when we were meant to be doing research. So congratulations to Zoe for turning digital notepassing into an activity that will eventually evole into an educational activity and already is. I can't wait to start talking about the topics and thanks again to Zoe for a great idea. It's great fun and will teach us some important skills.  GO ZOE!

      Today is a great day. After two months of arduous care and watering my BLACK Tulips finally sprouted. I was quite amazed as I gave up on them 1 month ago. So i am very happy today as i woke up to see three tiny tulip bud eyes staring up at me. But all i ask is that you all have a minute silence .... for the two tulips... that still have not sprouted. The only problem is they are now all completel out of season.  P.S I only published that because Ben told me to right about nothing. Last time he'll do that.  17/8 1 more Tulip has sprouted. Hooray.  20/8 All five Tulips have sprouted. My mission is complete. Two are really close together though. I think they're in love.

      (Not Sexy Weetbix!)  Has anyone ever noticed that weetbix seems to be really male orientated. I know hardly any women who eat weetbix. I'ts a conspiracy! (Or a marketing campaign.) But seriously all the adds have male sporting mebers in them and even though it is said that women are encouraged to eat folate high cereals weetbix is really high in folate.

      From the proverbial womb that is the internet a new baby blog has been given a sudden gift of life. And I the proud father (mother and parent for that matter) cannot help but feel a sense of pride that I now have total control of a new defenceless digital baby blog.
