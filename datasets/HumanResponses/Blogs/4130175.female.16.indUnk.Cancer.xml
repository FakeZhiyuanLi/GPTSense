VERY FUN. you should try it then we went to Emily's house & got ready for the first day of school it was fun. on Tuesday was just a day of school i don't think i did anything. BUT wednesday -- kt &amp; em came over to my house to get me they ended up staying here for a while and as we were leaving (( emily wanted to meet my sister's boyfriend )) RANDOM Holden showed up. haha. then we left and went to kt's house for her brother's 20th birthday OMG let's talk about fun. We played frisbie in the road and jammed to the music REALLY loud. ((jason, em, bee, kt & chris)) then we decided we wanted to go swimming so jason and chris like left. when they got back we ate and did our skittle thing haha. and finally went swimming !!! freakin' volleyball in the pool with NO LIGHTS. yeah it was hard. i guess we got bored of playing that because we attacked the guys and tried SO hard to get them under water but somehow WE always ended up underwater lol i almost DIED 08236789868354 times. .. yeah that's right i said it.       -- 8-19-04 --   volleyball in the pool. no LIGHTS. surfing in the pool. YOU HIT IT YOU GET IT. can we do a cannonball now!?. skittles. hot dogs AND hamburgers. poker. olympics. kt going crazy over paul hamm. beer bottles. chris' present. max the monstrosity. premi the pear. earl the christmas sqerual ((haha em's spelling)). the HAWT girls.       i can't think of anymore and i'm sure i'm missing a good one. :/ oh well it was fun and i'm SORRY you missed it. but i'm going to go. i have cross country in the morning.

       it's been a while since i've updated this thing not much has happend really on sunday i went to church (both services) then afterwords Jaclyn, Jessica, Kathryn, Rachelle and myself went to McDonalds ((jaclyn and i wanted panda express so we got that then walked over to McDonalds)) and we played "would you rather" it was sooo funny only i was kinda sad because it was my last sunday in Vegas - although i'm ready to be home w. my friends and family i always hate leaving the church. anyways I found a good church in San Antonio and miss. katie is going to go with me on sunday and we're very excited. haha anyways. yeah after we ate we went and droped off kathryn and rachelle then we went to jaclyn and jessicas house to get her brother since i live on the other side of las vegas he had to go with us. and then Alison and I went shopping at the gap and banana repbulic and DSW shoes for the rest of the day. It was bunches of fun talking about what all has happend this summer. then we went home and didn't do anything YAY. then on monday, tuesday and wednesday i had to babysit Garett. but jaclyn jessica and jason came over GOSH i love those kids to death they are like my best friends in las vegas. :) we watched confessions of a teenage drama queen and jason was SO entertained by lindsay lohan doing a flip in the beiginning of the movie that he had to watch it over and over again HAHA. it was so funny after they left i didn't do much at all. yay for an eventful life here in the desert. then today i woke up at like 11 and my aunt asked me if i wanted to go eat Korean food OF COURSE it's only the best thing since pizza !!  anyways it was SOOO good. but for some reason korean food doesn't make me full. it's weird. so here i am rambling on and on about what's happend in like the last week. How much do you care? yeah i thought so. Congradulations if you actually read this all you're such a great friend. anyways i'm going to go take a nap. i love you guys and i can't wait to see emily and the rest of the 'o6 ballin' pimpettes and do all the fun stuff haha !!! love you guys (again).       The stars will cry     The blackest tears tonight      And this is the moment that     I live for      I can smell the ocean air     And here I am     Pouring my heart onto these rooftops     Just a ghost to the world     That's exactly     Exactly what I need     From up here the city lights burn     Like a thousand miles of fire    And I'm here to sing this anthem   Of our dying day      bEe (( for some reason i really really like that song ))   yay for story of the year. :) haha. byyyyye.

       sick and tired of this world    there's no more air   tripping over myself, going now here   waiting, suffocating, no direction   i took a dive and   on the way down i saw you,    and you saved me from myself   and i won't forget the way you loved me   and on the way down i almost fell right through   but i held on to you   been wondering why it's only me   have you always been inside waiting to breathe   it's alright, sunlight on my face   i wake up and yet, i'm alive 'cause   on the way down i saw you,    and you saved me from myself   and i won't forget the way you loved me   and on the way down   i almost fell right through but i held on to you   i was so afraid of going underbut now,    the weight of the world   feels like nothing, nothing   you're all i wanted   you're all i needed..      and i won't forget the way you loved me.           :: brittanie ::

       hey guys ...   so i have ONE week left in Vegas and i'm sad but i'm very excited because i need to see my friends OMG i'm like having serious best friend withdrawls. Hillary was suppose to come up when i got back ((which i was told the 12th but isn't really it's the 14th)) so that means she'd only get to stay for a day and that's just gay. that girl can drive now haha yay !! anyways, i've already started getting all my stuff ready because i have like 5 million pieces of clothing just chillin around this house becasue my uncle puts my clothes everywhere thinking they are my aunts or cousins. GAY. SO anyways i get back to San Antonio on Thursday at 3:40 and as soon as i get to town i have to go to school woot woot .. to pick up some stuff for PALs HOPEFULLY somebody will be there and maybe a trainer will be there so that i can get a physical form so i can get a physical and yeah play soccer.

        Hey guys. I actually started a different blog thingy but it died .. which isnt surprising because MOST of the things in my life right now are starting to die. ((not really die .. but like fall apart)) sorry if you don't get it. Anyways, my aunt FINALLY had her baby and he's so super duper cute. I can't wait to meet him or is it that i absoultly cannot wait to get back to College Station ?! hmm good question but FIRST i must stop in San Antonio and visit -THE LOVES OF MY LIFE- ... emily soltau and katie evans and then of course the rest of the girls KATiE CATLAND. BRiTTANY ALONZO.MEGHAN M. haha sorry meg don't know how to spell your last name ... and i'm very excited about it because we have 2 months of gossip to catch up on which i'm sure we could catch up on our gossip in YOGA or when we go tanning HAHA .. hehe i KNOW you're jealous .. i'd be jealous if i didnt have best friends like them too. Emily & Katie are going to the airport with my mom and i'm SURE that brittany and katie catland will tag along .. just seems right haha anyways and wow i cannot wait to see the way people look at us haha we're going to go freaking crazy .. 2 months away from your best friends is just PURE tourcher. James and I have called it quits .. *sigh* it sucks but i'll learn to live w. it PLUS i make better grades when i don't have a boyfriend. yay for good grades and getting into TEXAS A&amp;M w. emily hahaha *DREAM BiG* but my mom and my sister are trying to hook me up with this guy his name is Chris and he wants to go to A&amp;M as well ... and he's 6 feet 2 .. GAH! but i still don't know because that would be two-faced .. RIGHT JAMES? yeah. ANYWAYS. i'm going to go and try to make my blog just as neat as katie and brittany's .. it' probably WON'T work. haha yay for stupid people. I LOVE YOU GUYS.      *beE*
