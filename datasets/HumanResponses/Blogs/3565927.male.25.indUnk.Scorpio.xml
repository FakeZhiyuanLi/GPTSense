      I think saturdays would be ideal to catch the 'Simple Life' where you see Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie rough it out in life. In fact, in a lot of ways these two girls kind of represent the majority of Singaporeans (not that we look like them or have their financial standing) but we are quite as lucky as these two girls. We have a shelter over our head, food, clothes and time to time able to indulge in other additional leisures in life. To say we are spoilt - it is probably too harsh... But we are in fact far more fortunate than a lot of people. Of course, we shouldn't compare ourselves with other countries but sometimes when we do comparisons, we are more easily grounded.  Many many of us (including me) haven't had a chance (or maybe we had) rough it out - just like the girls in Simple Life. I am guilty as charged :) I guess to rough it out doesn't mean we have to torture ourselves or do extreme stuff in life but I have seen people roughing it out from scratch. When I was in New York for my vacation in 1999, that's when I turn 21 there (Gosh, it feels like several years ago). I met an American guy who was 40 - nice breed of Dennis Quaid + Keifer Sutherland. Well, we hooked up and he took me around. Yeah, it was fun. Had deep conversations and from it I realised... He was just a grad from high school. He left florida and went to NYC (worked in Gap for 10 years) before he then became assistant manager in boutiques. Then, he heads 6 boutiques (when I knew him) - but he shifted to Chicago 2 years ago.   I really have a lot of respect for this guy. With his determination and hard work + experience, it was amazing. I mean yeah, qualification can take you places. But seriously, the paper chase in Singapore is way crazy at times. Even my parents jokingly said in 10 years time, you'll need a diploma to be a toilet cleaner. Why do parents equate toilet cleaner as 'Pathetic'? To them,it's like a dead end. But these people who do this job - they don't think so!?   Guess when you advance more in life and become more affluent. Your perspective just either get better or twisted. I wish I knew what we were doing on Earth sometimes. What is beyond the galaxy? Are we in a box? I think Life is so beautiful but emotions can cut us like a chopping board. Why does it hurt even more than a physical pain? Sean came and took the house key from me today. We met at Bugis. It was complete silence. I could kind of see tears in his eyes but I had to keep myself composed. I just couldn't stay there any longer. My memories would come back again like a dormant volcano. It would all gush out and boil me into fragments. Everytime what he has given me in my life - it's all slowly being returned to him. Maybe heartache does involve your every part of your heart being given away. I hope this ends. It seems ending all this is coming back like a tidal wave, from time to time, washing me with tears.  Quoting from Avril's latest single "My Happy Ending"  ..You were all the things I thought of you And I thought we could be  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...   .............................   Why can't we all smile and laugh like a child in the church I saw today? We've lost that in us at times...

      As much I would like to keep up with you people for the past 3 days. I've been sooo caught up just being lazy! :P Yes, I've got this opportunity to veg so I'm going to use as much of this time to do so until I officially join the work force. Anyway, as usual caught up with Clif on thurs (yeah you must be wondering why i'm getting laid every week) - but just so happen this whole month he is scheduled to fly to Singapore so I'm quite lucky. Anyway, the poor fella got some glass pieces stuck in his finger's bone thus he'll probably not fly (be on sick leave) to singapore for a month *sighs*  Well, guess it's the little things it's quite enjoyable when we catch up. Like how we'll sit by the television (where I insist on watching O.C. on thurs at 11pm no matter what) - have our red wine and talk. He was jokingly telling me that the O.C. (not shown in Sydney) is quite good and he should try flying to sg every thursday just for it?! lol In fact, tell you guys - the O.C. was already shown in US (when I was in New York in July 2003; last year), no wonder I found some episodes so familiar hehe... Yupe kind a DeJaVu for moi..  Funnily, maybe I've not told you guys but I think Clif and I are suffering from a same syndrome "He is a good f%ck and let's not fall in love" mentality... Maybe I'm wrong but there is a certain percentage I may be right/wrong I guess. I'm not dumb and my intuition does tell me at times. But seriously, last thing I want is another guy in my life to give me more problems lol.. After we parted, met up with Eileen for coffee. Yeah, she was attending a course.   Then met up with my ex-ibm colleagues. Had Sakae sushi at funan. It was so nice and filling. The something kind of happen. I will not mention names in here (to protect people's privacy and decency). A gal frd of mine had to do a lot of explaining to her boyfriend why she was not back home (hello it sounds like a curfew) and where she was. I hate to say this. We are way past our 'policeman in shorts' era HELLO!? I think she is an individual who can choose who she hangs out with and be responsible for herself. Yes, she's got a bf but it doesn't mean he has to revolve around her ONLY. I hate it when guys are MCP. (sorry galfrd for bitching ur bf in here lol)  Strangely, she told me she was ok him being like that. Geez, i don't think she's a masochist but really what is she up to? Do every strong front person has a subduded side? Hmmm I've ever read about something about this lady - mind you, in the 16th Century ok. She was a very posh, proud and feministic lady in the daytime. But in the night time, she was submissive and acted like a w*ore. Split personality? schizophrenic?  Maybe what you need is some spanking lol - my favourite line for some boys/girls out there (at times) *grins* Anyway, I'm glad I'm rested in my bed today (sat). Just wanted to spend time with myself and be home. Town (nowadays) can be so crowded I could go nuts..  It's 1117 pm and i'm going to bed.Is age catching up? You've got the answer haha..  nite

      As i met up with my 2 cousins - Clara and Angela, for dinner. I realise how much we have evolved - mind you - not changed :) It's interesting to see how we as kids when we played together in Farrer Park - no worries, just candies - sort of lifestyle. But now, shoved into the fast pace routine; where we call the Real World! I could remember how we would just meet up nearly every sunday at Farrer Park (before it got demolish) just to have family gatherings. That's when I remembered I was always excited.  My mother's side cousins are the ones I really talk more to and play a lot when we were younger, not my Dad's side. It seems to me when I spoke to my friends, the majority of them get along better with their mother's side. No Hokkien Drama mama (which u watch on TV) and rivalry. Why particularly the mum's side? It's really interesting - where we all can speak openly and just be ourselves. But when dad's side come, you kind of become like 'actors' and be the type of person that is not YOU.  Well, it looks like the only concern right now on our agenda was to get our tummy filled with good food at Sushi Tei so we ordered. Yeah, it took us like 15-20mins - can't believe it?! haha I was just telling Angela imagine if we were all Librians (typically indecisive people); that would probably 'help' the situation even better hehe So food came and we ate. It was not bad. Green tea was refillable and nice ambience  We actually had a family gathering at Pasir Ris (which I posted already) and I jokingly asked Angela why haven't u come for it? Well, I am so guilty (as I've been spending time with Sean, only on weekends as his weekdays are in KL) of not spending time with my mother's side members - yeah I felt like I was like a "use-to-be-maybe-well-known" celebrity that will choose to re-emerge in some gathering lol... I chose this gathering to 'show up' hhehe Anyway, rubbish on my side - I felt at peace when I saw everyone.  And just to get 3 of us for Karaoke - we have to flip our our organisers, I can't believe it... Yeah we all three had one each! It's amazing when you see one another grow up from kids to adults,marriage, kids and til the end of time. I think that's the beauty of kinship - it's never ending. No matter how bad you've kept in contact, memories of each other will always stay so deeply within you.   Okie, going to gym now

      Ohhh finally, got my final exam done today. I am close to like dead but I still have this need to write the blog (as much I can update daily). I mean I've been challenged by my classmate (whose name starts with the Alphabet  - that is the 6th position asecending; hey u DARE me OK hehe) to put his name so I've officially accepted his dare and hope he doesn't try to subsidise me lol (Yeah, this classmate will know what i'm talking haha). I met this classmate after my evening date with a nice tall Polish bred UK guy and it was a rather pleasant surprise. He is a well maintained 42 year old chap (for his age) and tall. Well, he brought me to a nice Indian restaurant which had a lift (yeah, in BOAT QUAY) that took us to the 5th storey. Oh boy, it was a nice view of Singapore's CBD and very breezy. We were early before 7pm and sat down.  You know first dates are like interviews. You'll never know what type of questions to be blasted onto you and anything happens?! Firstly, he looked like the picture he gave me - but I think he looked better in person. He is decent. That sort of Colin Firth appeal - normal looking but charming, yeah. I'm into that :) Goodlooking guys (not stereotyping) sometimes think due to their looks, they are considered charming. But being charismatic comes within from a person and looks alone is not that essence to it - it's how the person speaks, looks at you and exudes presence. His singapore based company has been already been 10 years running and shuttles regionally for work.  The indian food was superb (seriously also a pleasant surprise AGAIN) and we headed to coffee bean to cool off for a drink (quite spicy for the poor Mark lar hehe). Yeah, I'm glad our conversations were engaging, not only one sided and participative - with each own opinions. And I was also whispering to my classmate that what I've learnt in Class (like Media Law) has probably earned me brownie points in sounding 'intelligent' when I spoke to him lol...   Well, the night ended nicely after Coffee Bean where he took a cab back to town (home) and me walking to Raffles place to take my bus 14. As I was on my MP3, he smsed me a nice sms saying it was great to have met me and he had a special evening. I hate it when I've got to INITIATE to sms such things to the other person - so I was secretly glad he did it and I replied to him lor ha ;) Anyway, I'm happy dating right now and I think Singlehood has been the best thing so far for me.  Keeping you people updated..  More soon (Akan Datang)

      Well, had an interesting chat with my classmate today and he told me via the phone that my thoughts being placed online are really quite detailed. But really, I guess there is really nothing to hide on my part. Maybe that's why I share quite strong sense of belonging with Jee at times and we speak our minds. Not sure if it's a good thing or not. Talking about speaking our minds, met up with a friend and we strolled the beach today.  It was a beautiful day. Loads of people slowly filling up the east coast beach. Then I started to tell my friend how my caucasian friend made racist remark and he came up to me telling me that i've been too passive in terms of 'protecting' the asians. Well, I think if it was me 6 years ago - I may just laugh up and ignorantly have no idea (making out the messages). I don't know but maybe I've been portrayed that I've been only into caucasian guys to my friends. But I've been very 'United Colours of Benetton' and not discriminated anyone - dated all races!  I don't deny I can be quite an easy-going person but I don't take any bullsh*t if I think it's wrong (Not trying to prove a point in here to my friend whom I was talking at the beach by the way :) Maybe I don't make myself clear enough to my friends but all I can say is that I've made mistakes in how my relationships/dating/friendships are concerned and I do admit that there were probably times I gave in. But really, I am getting way too old for time-wasters.   I'll definitely be the first to admit I'm not perfect. If I was, I'll be up there - not on planet Earth :)  Back to books,  B  P.S. By the way, I've checked my diary and this is my breakdown of the demographic of      people I've dated so far in my life! (and I don't go around telling you all the       people I've dated right?)  :P       Caucasians - 30%      Chinese    - 50%      Malays     - 8%      Indians    - 10%      Eurasians  - 2%

      I'm glad that the blog doesn't require me to speak to produce words as I've just had a marathon yesterday. Well, not that kind of marathon you would think :P hehe Me and Adele locked ourselves and sang karaoke in K-Box from 1930 til 0200 yesterday (5 and 1/2 hrs) -my throat is still sore mind you. I think I've officially became a 'Singapore Idol' without even auditioning for the contest hehe... Yeah, it was quite crazy and not that cheap also errr.. But glad we did it - it's a very good outlet!   I miss the times when I was in Polytechnic and we'll head to this friend who has a LD player - she plays Sammi Cheng concerts and I'll prance around crazily imitating her lol When one get older, I think you really don't have much stamina anymore :) Exams are round the corner and here am I still playing. Well, I'm just a last minute person really. I seriously haven't in my life studied earlier before exam dates. In this aspect, my disciplinary department needs brushing up.  A scary fear suddenly hit me as I was singing Rene Liu - Afterwards (Hou Lai). The song's lyrics spell out quite a lot when I saw one of my friend singing to it. She was upset when she lost her lover. Yeah, I can feel what she feels now. I'm a sucker for sad songs. Drama me. Maybe I should start getting my act in Korea and be some crying weepy actor? I was literally being identified as one of them (korean) when I was in Seoul - of course I need to really brush up on my verbal skills rather than surviving on this one line "Han-gugonun mot'amnida" ( Means: I don't understand Korean)  Why has korean fever hit the crowd with so much frenzy? Are we not depress enough already as humans with our own problems? Guess we are just like how the cantonese people would have a saying "You take sh*t and rub it all over you" ( I don't really know how to spell it in cantonese hehe). Maybe it is an escapism when we see other people being depressed and we can re-assure ourselves we are fine/luckier than those people on the drama serials? Guess we should start experimenting on the housewives who've glued themselves so faithfully to these serials and squeeze out the essence of this attraction.  Going for tea now (yeah, will write notes later, YAWNS, tell me what's new? hehe)

      Well, from the above title - it does say a lot for my situation now. While moving my stuff from Sean's apartment, I unknowingly twisted my neck. Not feeling very good and just not in the mood to do ANYTHING. *Grrrr* Well, I thought I could start writing my notes for my exams but just no motivation. I hate exams. Well, it's all the studying and when you enter the exam hall. It's like diarrhoea and you just let it ALL (what you studied) go in one shot. Some suffer from constipation (memory block) and some just let it 'flow' all the way hehe...  Talk about flow - do ensure you check your money flow for your bank account. Apparently my ex's VISA card has been duplicated (in KL) and unknown transcations has been made without him knowing. Thankfully, the card has been frozen and he does not need to pay anything. Well, people are all out to get others eh. It's so dangerous to even leave your name or any particulars with anyone as you seriously never know what they'll do to it. I mean if you saw the National Kidney Foundation hand in hand with Aviva where Singaporean's particulars have been disclosed (though 'sworn' with privacy) - when they do donations?! I mean hey, it's for the good of these kidney failure people - they shouldn't get some marketing (Aviva) company involve.  I can't wait, seriously can't wait, *ouch* to get my neck back..  Again  Me

      The most dreadful thing when you break up is to get all your stuff back. Yeah, I headed to Sean's place to pick up all my clothes and whatever I've left there. It feels weird. The house looks different. Someone else has been here - yeah his new lover - Gilbert. Do you know when you let a stray cat into your home...the thing the cat will do is to curl around the furniture, wall, anything that it can get in contact to as to leave a 'cat mark' there. So in future, they will know they've been there. Well, guess I could see the new cat mark now in Sean's place. Additional stuff. Feels as though that I've slowly pieced up this puzzle in life and suddenly I accidentally smash on it. Destroying everything I've built.   I slowly walked around the house - like the cat - but not leaving any 'cat marks' but just reminiscing when I first touched the kitchen, prepared food under that hot environment (until he bought a fan later on for me in the kitchen), cooked my first pasta, sat by the closet and read my magazine as I drank chilled Ribena. As I continued to walk around the apartment - I just heaved and know I do not belong here anymore. I am glad I've released myself of all the repeated times where I wanted out of the relationship before I officially implemented it to Sean. Maybe I've never told you guys but yes, I wanted out even in Feb this year already. Why? I simply can't answer why but there were so many things happening - he was in a fix whenever he did anything - everything went wrong. If you think I'm superstitious but sometimes the signs shown can be a gentle alert in life you know.  Packed up everything and called him up that I was over at noon. Now it's time to fill up my closet. Is there anymore space? No. I wish I had more room for anything else. The only space I've got is for myself. This heart is aching. Slowly. But still hanging in there, steadfast.  I remembered the first poem I've ever composed (for Sean) and this may be my last...  ---------------------------------------------  Love is when you first kissed me at the airport supposedly I see  Love is when I wake beside you and I can't stop admiring my beau  Love is when you showed me your honesty and filled me with that earnesty  Indeed distance has made it tough but love won't turn rough  Steadfast is in it for us imagine how this made us last  Await in few more years as we soak in joyous treats                                                         - Brendan

      I think I will go to bed soon. Just had dinner and panadol. It's barming today in Singapore *phew*. I wish I was soaked in the water or something. Yeah, will try to wake up early tommorrow and get some studying done as my weekend will be filled with other activites :) Met up with Clif yesterday and had quite a sumptous dinner at Sakura. Had deep fried squid, thai chilli chicken and beef kai lan - yeah, so filling! Ended up burping the whole night hehe.. Then his close crew friend Jean Paul (Italian guy) came over to chill out in his room and we had drinks. Well, the red wine was fabulous and just rattled rubbish as I was a bit high hehe.. It was good company and then Jean Paul's date came and we all parted, did our own things.   Mind blowing last night and waking up late in the morning - Life's pleasures :P Yeah, if only I could just be a nice tai tai that do not need to work and just enjoy life eh?! Isn't that all of our desires? hehe Clif will be flying off really early next day (he needs to be up at 5am) so we parted, so he also can hang out with his crew mates. Spoke a lot about his life, crew, principles and other stuff. Engaging conversation I should say but I just feel something is missing from him. Guess I've reached a stage where I don't have any expectations anymore from him and just enjoy the company. Maybe I just need more time to heal. How I should re-adjust my life soon to the working society.  I just need to sleep now. Thank God the aircon is repaired today. Was suffering with for the past 4 days without it - quite a torture - as it was quite warm in the night. Will catch up more.  Nite nite

      Yupe, one shouldn't reveal too much to others in life (especially to potentials hehe). Be as hard hearted as a rock. But with the tendency where there are times you just melt and be viscous,flowing in all directions. I'm not sure why I'm writing this but it has got to be the time I've got right now on hand (I mean I should be studying).  Just was so surprise to bump into my really long lost ex poly classmate online at MSN. He has been in Vancouver (Studying) for a few years and now working as a designer. I remembered he told me he wanted to join Japan's finest graphic cartoonist and work in their realm :) Gosh, I wish I had that freedom he got on hand now. Can't wait to graduate by the end of the year, the sort of additional 'wings' I'll be bestowed to do more in my life. It's not I'm not able to do things now in life but it really does boil down to financially. But hey, doesn't mean when you start working - you'll be able to enjoy your money - NO TIME!  As my best friend says, I just probably end up like Miss Teo "Rich" and no life, if i'm not careful. Guess Passion is also another essence to keep one alive and kicking. My flight attendant friend has been flying already for about 4 years and think he's thinking of going back to school. Well, he feels he can't be flying for the rest of his life and it does get mundane. What pushes us in life? Just being rich + successful = loneliness?   Yeah, you must be wondering what sorta equation I'm blabbering about but maybe what we need is some kind of chemical in life. Lots of endorphines *yippee* hehe I want to be happy all the time but what are the things that make one happy? Quoting from Jeremy, what is the thing in life that makes you most angry and most happy? For a moment, me and his cousin - speechless. Could we not know what we want out of life anymore? Yeah, questions questions questions.   Holler on  B

      Just seriously can't wait to plonk myself into bed. Having the laptop beside me as I'm writing this blog. Good News was up around 9am to get my ass to my hair stylist all the way in the west but I've got myself a nice hair cut. Bad news is that 2molo is her last day as the current shop will be sold to another person (as she is freelancing) thus she needs to find another shop to fit her schedule. Yeah, I've been with her for like 8 years and she's literally linked to my tastes in what i want out of my hair. Love her to death!! hehe To Adele who wanted a 'practical haircut', please lar hehe... Janice (my hairstylist) is versatile - she can do whatever hair you want lol hehe  Quite fun just hanging out with my mum's side of her siblings and cousins. Watching the young cousins playing frisbee and soccer. Well, then we headed for dinner and my my I was in a ride haha Took a chance with Sebastian's (cousin avissa's husband) lorry and it was fun. I think it's nice to have a bit of open air driving from time to time. heheh...You can see it from the pic how fun it was haha..  Sweet dreams people  B

      I think I've been the most productive person on Earth (for at least today). Met up with 4 different friend in a span of a day *gosh* haha My ex-neighbour's wedding was held at 0830am this morning and seeing she & Steven exchanging vows hmmmm it was really touching and beautiful. I could feel how she felt. She sworn to her lifetime husband that she'll be there for the rest of the time for him, even in time of poor, sick and anytime... Yeah I'm a sucker for good endings. Why do we still believe it is out there? Do you or it's just me.   After being 2 years with someone just has been a habit or out of love. Obligations? I wish i could really tell you why. Maybe there isn't an answer for everything we do in life. Maybe it was all fixed and we were just props just doing through it. Everyone coming into our lives were a reason. They were here to stay. Or some not.  I'm feeling most sentimental and vulnerable in the night. I miss those times where I'm spoon to bed. yeah, it's a nice feeling of being hugged to sleep. Well, what to do?! It seems I'm not the only one hitting splitville. Met up with other friend's today and realise he n she are single now. The universe is telling us something? I sure do hope not. I think it's wonderful to be coupled. But to whom? Should we just settle? How long should we wait?  I do feel like Carrie bradshaw in SATC writing this blog but it seems it has been helping me get over my grieve and displeasures in life (apart from bitching it to your friends in person haha ) Maybe in life, things do happen for a reason. Ahhh...  A pic of the bride walking down the aisle and heading to her happiness  Nite  B

      Wish I wrote yesterday but nope I didn't. It was a really long day.Had my exams in media law and boy (Thank God) it was fine! :) Damn lucky the questions were broken up into various section thus not a huge weightage is on a whole question or something?! Well, met Clif yesterday and I slept over. Had quite a nice glass of wine and we manage to catch up a bit. It was nice. We literally kept ourselves busy til like 5 am hehe.. Then got up at like noon half past 1. Had a nice clam chowder soup and hung out a bit. Yeah, he left for a flight to London around 9pm and will be back next tues *can't wait*   Just got back home from dinner with family and we had delicious fish steamboat. The chilli was so yummy mmmmm mmmmm It's my ex-neighbour's wedding 2molo and will be going for a church's wedding so I'll be asleep soon. Going to have a long day 2molo...

      Geez, brother just cooked a rather delicious Omelette with ham + tomatoes for me and it's delish...hehe Well, in the midst of completing my bloody final assignment for the semester, can't wait *phew* Just thought I pen some my thoughts for the day. I'm in fact quite tired from baking in the sun today hehe...Was at the beach (did I ever tell you it is about 10-15mins walk from my home) and just sorting out my thoughts.  With regards to the Clif saga, yeah - he replied to my email. I think I frighten him off a bit and I'm rather lucky to have him still wanting to meet up?! *gosh* Seriously, any guy who read the last email which I sent about (not keeping up with communicating and blah blah blah) would be freaked out and just want OUT. Well, guess he's a gentleman and we'll see when I meet after my exams the day after 2molo. Oh well, I seriously can't wait hehe..  As adele says with regards to men - they just like to take it slow and not rush. Some of them are either dumb or just want to be challenged or something?! hmmm Strange and complicated eh...I wish life was just more simple. I guess being alone is not easy and am not really use to it. Attention being given in the past was rather intense I guess, thanks to sean... But well, I'm blessed to have my friends just being around me.  Thank you guys for helping me through these bad times and I am seriously lucky. Even my boss lavinia has been supportive and just help sort sort out my thoughts. I better get going and finish up the final portion. Then get some sleep. Will meet adele for lunch 2molo and catch up a bit.  I miss travelling *sighs*...  Alrighty,  Love  B

      I seriously have no idea what came over me but guess laying out my thoughts can help me be sane I guess lol Well, this idea is literally Jee's as I've been reading her blogs constantly and it's quite a nice outlet where you n your friends can frequent n read what's going on in your life (apart from emailing)..  Maybe I should take this chance to officially do a press release in here too eh?!  "Solo Me"  Yupe, just 2 weeks ago - I've underwent a rather traumatic breakup. I'm single. A little bit glad and a little bit sad. I mean it was 2 years with Sean and I loved him a lot. Well, we were drifting and lots of other issues erupted along the way - that I felt I can't love him enough to deal with those issues. Yeah, I wanted out and I got what I wanted.We are friends now and amazingly possible. He went on his first date yesterday and it seems to be smooth sailing :) I'm so HAPPY for him!!! It's seriously hard to find someone to click and he's blessed.   Well, I'm right now only bogged by books and exams (same old same old me). If only books and exams can give you orgasms?! lol Was out with Gerard and we ended up having some blurred cashier from U2 that f*cked up the whole totalling of the bill (not helping when we were starving)..*yikes* So much for discounts but we got it sorted. Yeah, Gerard was absolutely pissed.. Who is not guilty right now for shopping during this Singapore Sale, Hands up? :P  It's weird but I think I feel quite emotional now. Yeah, I need a hug and someone who I can lean closely to. It's hard being alone and guess it's all setting in.I guess the questioning part of the program is over (quoting from SATC) - the party is officially over, it's an end of an era. Well, it's strange how things are now. And seriously, this blog is a rather good outlet *Gosh* You can just write and write...  I wrote a rather stupid email to clif (whom I've been corresponding via email) and saying to him that I am beginning to like him but am confuse. I said I was angry why he did not email me when I emailed him 3 times? I am so scared. I don't want to fall in love, not at least now. He touched me like never anyone in my life and this scares me. That email might even be my last and not sure how he would react to it - yeah, guess I blew my only chance with a guy but yupe...hmmm  I need to get back to my last assignment. Want to hand it up 2molo. I am exhausted.   As always  B

      As we were kids, we throw tantrums and make our parents give in to our demands. Yes, they would eventually give in to us but they are biologically linked to us. But the world, that is in front of us - not linked in any way to us. Do you think they'll submit to us? Especially emotionally - yes the grey area. We grow older and become more emotionally in tuned to the surroundings or we need to become more intellectually challenged. My friend who is currently following Sex And the City from Season 1 til to the end says that this show brings hope to people, fake hope. I retorted to him and said it's not true. The show kinds of bring us to think and show the various situation/consequences we may bump in our lives. You probably think I'm contradictory now as I said from my last blog that movies are bullshit and why right now Sex And the City is the 'Dalai Lama' for humans. Well, maybe I could relate to myself to the ladies some way or another to the characters (though I'm in Singapore and without the female anatomy hehe).  I think I'm back to my old self. I'm glad. I know it's only been 5 days since I was back but trust me. It was hard. I fell hard with Eric. I was even thinking (naively) that he may like me and avoiding me like a plague?! (I mean come on, you may never know too right). I think different guys react differently when they found their equivalent match. I think what we had was all too fast - in terms of connecting with one another. Of course, it doesn't help when he was there and I'm here. I woke up and the 'coffee' has awoken me. The caffine this round will be strong enough to keep me UP this time.  Maybe you think I'm crazy to take Song lyrics to relate to me but it's easier. When I was in Bangkok with Eric, He Sang the Chorus of TaTa Young (he said this Song represented me) " Naughty Naughty Naughty, Sexy Sexy Sexy, Bitchy Bitchy Bitchy, B..(Brendan)" I found that really funny and just got charmed (yupe even more haha).  As we were hanging out and cuddling in the bed. Just being togther. Then the Song that was playing in my head later on was TaTa Young's - I Believe " I feel the heat around me..I feel the beat surrounds me..Could this be real, I wonder...No need for hesitation...It's time for celebration...Will this be the night I've waited for..."  After I got back from Bangkok with a reality check. Now TaTa Young's - Cinderella plays in my head " I don't wanna be like Cinderella...Sittin' in a dark old dusty cellar...Waiting for somebody, to come and set me free...I don't wanna be like Snow White waiting...For a handsome prince to come and save me....On a horse of white, unless we're riding side by side...Don't want to depend on no-one else.....I'd rather rescue myself..."  Nuts to have teenybooper songs to keep me alive. But it's working hahaha Well, this is to keep me sane ok. There is never a fix time limit to get over somebody. But I think I'm over Eric. I don't want to be hurt anymore, deep in sorrows. He was happy memories for me. I have to let this go. My heart will be hard as stone by my next trip to Bangkok soon. I don't need all this now. My friends have been so supportive and thanks (you know who you ARE) :)  Okie, time to end. Close box. Stop playing TaTa Young in background :P I'm back! Samantha (but younger, sexier, more naughty and more bitchy)

       The Cover Girls&nbsp;- Wishing on a Star    --------------------------------------------------   I'm wishing on a star  To follow where you are  I'm wishing on a dream  To follow what it means   And I wish on all the rainbows that I see  I wish on all the people who really dream  And I'm wishing on tomorrow praying never comes  And I'm wishing on all the loving&nbsp;&nbsp;we've never done   I never thought I'd see  A time when you would be  So far away from home  So far away from me   Just think of all the moments that we'd spent  I just can't let you go from me you were meant  And I didn't mean to hurt you but I know  That in the game of love you reap what you sow   I feel it's time we should make up baby  I feel it's time for us to get back together  And make the best of things oh baby  When we're together whether or never   &nbsp;   This song kind of represent how i feel now. Actually, I feel a part of me being lost right now. Yes in Bangkok. I sometimes think if I haven't met Eric, maybe my life would be better - less fuss.&nbsp; I keep telling myself he is a player - an assh*le so I won't feel so bad about the situation. I spoke to Sean about it and he said when I could identify Eric from far,it's all fated and meant to be (considering he is my ex, he spoke quite sweet words to me). Why can't&nbsp;the&nbsp;unsure part of everything be more obvious? Not hidden...    &nbsp;   Jee told me that I am in control of the situation and shouldn't be upset/down about the whole thing. I&nbsp; spend the night crying for a while, curling up in the corner of my bed. I don't want any other guy to touch me, have sex with me or want to do anything. It's like I was touched by an Angel. Maybe I am exaggerating and spouting nonsense with the whole feeling. How much can u know within 14 hours with a person? But&nbsp;watching the movie 'The Sweetest Thing' where Cameron Diaz met this guy at the club. She never believed in love. She felt something for him. How she travelled nearly 2 hours (just like me soon to bangkok over National Day weekend), driving (for my case I jet) to go to see this guy's brother's wedding. Turns out he was the one who's getting married. She gets disappointed. All she feels now is nothing. But Fate brings of them together.     &nbsp;   Well, movies are nothing but bull-shit I guess. How many of us would end like the leads in the movies? A small percentage or non in fact. Maybe I've been starved of some excitement in my life. I need something to ignite me. I can't wait to graduate at the end of the year so&nbsp;I can stretch my wings and fly further, far far away. I am going to meet Sean for dinner now. Bought him a shirt and going to catch up. I miss being a couple - not my rebound side talking :P     &nbsp;   Slowly recovering     &nbsp;   B

      Geez, how should I even start in here. Firstly, it's weird to be back from BKK after the weekend as it was my first trip since I was there when I was 9 years old and this round it was so much fun with the gals (Carine and Regina). Even better is when I did meet someone nice; ironic thing is that the guy was french. Well, maybe some of you knew I had a torrid dating with Olivier - Remember that photographer, yeah I did say I would swear off french for the rest of my life. Looks like life is pulsated in such a way is when you say I'll 'NEVER' - it's usually the next time your 'NEVER' will come colliding into your life unknowingly *sighs*  First day (24-07-03)  Was really excited. Couldn't really sleep the night before so watched Murial's Wedding to try tire myself out - such a funny flick about an Aussie girl's objective in life to listen to ABBA and wait for her prince charming to drop into her life inevitably. Well, with all the ABBA that you've got from that movie, it really does bring back some nice radio moments we had in school.&nbsp; Anyway, then Carine gave me a buzz and we chatted nicely for over an hour before we hit the sacks. Woke up and then waited for her, John, her mum to pick me up via the taxi. It was drizzling the whole morning. Just couldn't wait to get out of the country. Just felt I wanted to 'fly'. Met up with Regina's Uncle plus his entourage. Well, Ah Kai (regina's uncle) is a regular jetting up to BKK and knew his way around very well. I think a lot of people headed up to BKK would talk to him also he made friends quite easily with anyone :) Well, Carine's mum was having a lot of reservation about her going for her vacation but I assured her she would be fine. So we headed to the foodcourt a while, had a quite bite. Then we started to walk towards the boarding gate.&nbsp; I was so surprise with the numbe of people headed to BKK. It was hordes. Many indians were also present as this flight would stop over BKK and fly to bombay too.   We got quite nice seats, all 3 seated together. Sat down and up we went. Arrived in about 2 hours time. Then Ah Kai got the bus to send us to our hotel. Boy, after 16 years not being there - I think I saw so much changes in BKK. Definitely is the traffic - the highway was a good thing that ever happened for the country apart from the BTS (same as Singapore's MRT).&nbsp;Reached the hotel and all 3 of us had a culture shock. It looked like a karaoke sorta prostitution kinda hotel place - even hotel 81 would look nicer lol :P Anyway, we got into the room. The design was so retro and Taj Mahal. I think the girls were really shocked - even Carine wanted out to stay in another hotel. I was amazed and laughed so much with our hotel rooms. Well, instead of reminiscing of our new 'fabulous' room. We need to start off the new first day with some shopping. So we got our butts off and took the&nbsp;BTS. Enjoyed the ride and got to MahboonKrong Center. It was huge and it was amazing (just like their country's tourism slogan currently ;) ! Well, got nice bargains and a SIM card. The instruction for the SIM card was all in Thai but finally manage to figure it out as I was trying to call Eric (french guy whom I was going to meet up in BKK so he could take me around to the gay clubs). Finally manage to send him an sms and he replied to meet me up. Then the we all got crazy and took our mane for some nice hair cut. 300 Baht was reasonable for a cut wash blow ( well, until I finally get a reply from my Hairstylist, Janice where is her new base for my haircut). Got myself quite a nice hair stylist - very attentive and spend quite a long time cutting my hair. Well, it finally balanced out the sickening 'slope hair cut from army' blunder when I was in reservist weeks ago.   Got into the cab and headed back. Then we all showered and uncle took us out to eat dinner. Well honestly, have no idea where we were but it was further up (10mins) from&nbsp;Silom. It was a nice chinese restaurant. We had like 10 dishes, yeah eaten like a chinese wedding ten course meal menu. Had suckling Pig (a whole pig), pepper crab soup, stir fried cabbage (without oil, very interesting and healthy), deep friend pork and many more. Then, we had a nice visitor. It was a baby elephant. Well, Ah Kai bought some sugar cane and fed the elephant. We were in the midst of the crab so I had to whip out the camera and take a shot. It was so cute and all of us fed the baby elephant. I think all of us were afraid of the elephant's wet trunks and if it would swing against us lol So after dinner, we all headed to Silom's gay area. It was filled up with so many connecting bars and pubs. The Thais would harass us to patronise their shop. It was so aggressive. Then we all entered Future Boyz. Well, you would never imagine how much d*ck you could see in the night - yupe ;) Thai guys (mostly straight by the way) dancing to music with no emotion. It was a rather depressing sight and I felt very uncomfortable. Yeah, this is the 'anal-virginal' side of me you have not seen but I just wanted to get out of the place. It screams weird. The mobile phones did not have reception when u r inside (looks like the Singapore's Esplanade was not the only successful industry&nbsp;in shutting mobile connections within theatres). Then I got out and called Eric. It was terrible - he couldn't hear me properly. Even when I spoke to him earlier; he couldn't hear me properly. I had this hunch that maybe we weren't fated to meet up at all. But anyway, I waited outside Future Boyz while I see the crowd walk pass me - can also identify some Singaporeans from time to time haha.. Then a funny thing happen. The future boyz club was beside Dick's Cafe (yeah a rather cliche name within a gay area lol) and I got an sms from Eric that he was waiting upfront in the cafe. There was the outside and aircon. Obviously I thought it was the outside so i saw a guy who looks (I never knew what he looked like) the closest to Eric's Age (34) and approached him. Turns out - he was not Eric. Then, after the wrong identification - I saw a tall guy bumping into his drink. Yeah, my gut told me it was him (typical Pisces - careless in nature lol). So I called his mobile and saw his mobile rang. Then I walked towards him. Well, then we smiled and sat, talked. It was nice, pleasant and unexpected. So he had his Pad Thai while I yakked my while through and the charming thing was that he managed to speak his mind, not a passive listener ( definitely a cookie point for this plus).   Then we left the cafe and walked towards to another Coffee Cafe to meet up his group of clicks. His 'sister bemas' was a Singaporean guy 47 who looked 30 (yes i saw it with my own eyes). He lived in Singapore not for a while but travelled and lived overseas mostly (9 years in Denmark) - was a teacher/actor/multi-talented guy. Smart, witty and funny. Well, we all had a good laugh and chatted quite a bit about Singapore plus other stuff. The Indian + French guy (nice couple) were slowly settling in BKK buying furniture and were together for 20 years *swoons* Yes, 20 years together, faithful. And, there is such thing as longevity in relationships. Then thought we would all head clubbing together but they were exhausted or their thing to do. Eric was a regular in the cafe and seems the Thai gays were quite friendly to everyone. Everyone seem to know everyone.&nbsp;So Eric took me to the linked clubs nearby. It was so packed like a tuna can. More packed than Taboo in singapore. Tell you, you need at least 15mins to move from one end to another. Muscle marys prancing on the stage and we just stand upstairs got our drinks. While we people watched and spoke a while, decided to infiltrate the dance floor together. Then I lead the way and got ourselves inside for a while. But I was sweating like a pig and Eric was considerate enough to want to leave the club. Then We took ourselves to the nicely designed Arabian pub beside the club. Nice cushions and we continued more chats. He was not your typical french spoilt boy (who loves his country to death) and we talked a lot about travelling, people, thoughts about life. I think I was so starved of intellectual stimulation in Singapore and this guy was just so sincere + funny+ smart enough, charmed the hellout of me :) Oh well, we chatted til 2am and it was the end of the night. All clubs and pubs close at 2am in BKK. Then we walked out and I proposed to him about the cramp room (which was the truth but I wanted a good reason to sleepover with him)&nbsp; which I had and the girls snoring (sorry carine and regina) to stay over with him. Before I could ask him the question, he could read my mind. Well, we took a nice stroll back to his very cosy apartment. It was just a nice room connected with toilet. He was neat. Then he asked me to take a shower and when all my clothes were off, he hanged them up for me - which was sweet. After my shower, I found myself in a nicely lit candle bedroom and he went to have his shower. I just relaxed and lay on the bed to rest. When he walked towards me and lay next to me. It just felt to nice and comfortable. Felt right. U know that sort of feeling when you know it is the right feeling/time. We kissed gently and he stroked me in the most nice way you could ever imagine. He enjoyed kissing me on my face, hands, head and shoulders - just what I needed. We had close to 5 hours of foreplay but had a good balance of chat in between. It was perfect. He did quite an amazing thing, we 'did' it while he lifted me off totally as he was standing. Well, I'm not exactly light so he lasted for 1 min and we laughed it off that i was not 7kg but 70 kg to carry hehehehe... But he would change positions and it was just the way how I wanted it. Sorry, too much information but this is MY blog :P  &nbsp; Second day (25-07-04)  Then we just relaxed and he finish it off the 'morning' at 6:30am by spooning me off to sleep *gosh* So i got up at 11 and headed back to the hotel to meet up with the girls. We had a 2pm massage appointment so we ate lunch with Ah kai before we went there. Lots of questioning came from the girls and then I spilled the beans that he was pleasant, good. Apparently, the girls told me that some Thai money boys at Future Boyz wanted to pick them up for the night hhahaah They were winked at and they ignored ;) Anyway, we had more exotic food. Duck's Tongue and other stuff at lunch. Arrived the Spa cum massage place and it was so peaceful - very simple and chic design. We were greeted by the receptionist and then had our footware changed into their slippers. Waited a while and then they took us to the room. I shared the room with Carine where we had a nice outside view. We changed into our PJs and laughed at one another as we looked like hospital patients hehe... Then we started with the message. Felt so relaxed and had half way fruits n chinese tea served to us. The whole massage was close to 2 hours 20mins for 600 Baht.&nbsp;   In between my massage, I sms Eric to ask him to join us for tea in Silom as we would be heading there later on but I got an sms like this " Sorry can't and don't be jealous&nbsp;as i'm busy. Have to do another sg boy my systera bemas. C u 2nite!" Honestly, when I got this sms I was like - WHAT?! I don't need so much information about your sex life. Yeah then I realise I kinda was trapped in the bad warp - I may just like the guy syndrome. Do you know? I think I'm cursed at times. Whenever I like someone, it usually turns out bad. Like very very bad and I won't end up with the person. My 2 past relationship was initated by ex boyfriends and they probably liked me more than I liked them. Maybe I was thinking too much but I just finished up the massage. So we all just headed back to hotel and showered, changed. Regina's Thai friend invited us over for a home cooked thai dinner meal and we all went. It was a very nice dinner and so delicious. You could see how warmth and hospitable the mother was. She was so nice and gorgeous. We just communicated with our limited Thai but all her 3 sons could interpret for us from English. The night ended nicely and we took the underground (MRT) to Lumphini; Night Market. The gals were nice enough to keep me company til&nbsp;I met up with Eric at around 10pm. I was contemplating to meet up with him but Carine told me to keep cool, just not be brash. After shopping we all went to the same cafe (where I met up with Eric and his friends before) and we all sat down. Then Eric came, we all seated ourselves nicely in a comfy area. So I asked him (sacarstic) how was his Singapore friend in the afternoon? Then he said it was good, he was with Bemas, whom I met last night. I suddenly realised he was with Bemas (the nice 47 singaporean guy who was his best friend, so it was not SEX) Aiyoh, I felt so embarassed and he cleared up the air. I was relieved heheh Then we all chatted a while and then I sent the ladies to take a cab. While&nbsp;me and Eric&nbsp;slowly walked back to relax at his apartment.   Nicely showered. He made nice tea for me. Then coming from my behind, he wrapped his arms around my waist, with his head resting on my shoulders while I scanned through my digital camera pictures to show him. I tell you...it was like a slice of heaven. As seeing the pictures, he would gently stroke me, kiss my neck and hug my closely to him. I think this couldn't get any better. We then had tea and relaxed beside one another. With Eric, we could stare at each other and not speak at times. It was like we were connected. Then a really freaky thing happen. I asked him of his ascendent for his astrology. He insisted me to guess and I guessed correctly at the 2nd time. Then, I matched all up.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brendan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outcome  Sun Sign&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pisces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp; Scorpio&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best Match  Ascendent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saggi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp; Gemini&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Match  Chinese&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; +&nbsp; Horse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9/10  &nbsp;  Maybe I'm not suppose to read too much into such things but it was just the intellectual stimulation that mattered so much more to me. His company was priceless, not sure if he being a french (a romancer) or what. But I don't think he would do what he did to me to everyone - well of course i'll never know if he was a 'player'. But then, he told me that he hardly open to people he knew (which he did) and asked me how I felt when he made love to me *aiyoh*... I mean, it was like a piece of chocolate which I was nibbling for the whole trip when I was with him, in&nbsp;and out of bed. Really, it was his height, watery blue eyes, not super good looking but very genuine person with funny personality that bowed me.&nbsp; I spooned him to sleep at 5 am and he got up for work&nbsp;at 830am the next day to get ready for work. Then woke me up later and I got ready also to head back to the hotel. We walked to Coffee World and head a nice cold coffee together. Both not morning people and just looked at the morning crowd walked past us. Then he walked me to my train station and bade me good bye. A nice day awaits me :)  Last day (26-07-04)  Took a BTS back to the hotel. Showered and apparently, horrible things happened to the girls last night when they went to the night club to celebrate Ah Kai's birthday. He asked the Thai money boys to come along and each accompanied everyone in our entourage. Carine and Regina felt uncomfortable. The guys were so persistent and wanted to come into their bedroom. Carine freaked out the most and she just wanted peace. Anyway, she hugged me when she first saw me in the early morning and I just comforted her it was alright *sighs* Those Thai money boys - the things they do in the name of dough. Then we all got ready and Carine n Me had a mission. To find the bridal shop to get quotes for her sister's upcoming wedding. The cab driver did not know the exact route (but at least he stopped to ask for directions as compared to one which we had that took us for a RIDE) so we got off far end of the road. Had to walk for about 25mins and it was so warm. But we finally found the place *thank God* and just got quotes. Met with Regina in Silom and we all went to Anna's Cafe (Named after Anna and the King). The food was delicious my goodness. We had thai salad, Toffee Banoffee (some toffee cake with banana and nice cream), thai fish cake, beef green curry and we just ate ate ate. Did last minute shopping and i got myself season 1-4 Sex and the City DVD for 2000 Baht (70 SGD). The quality is surprising not bad and I think it was a steal as one DVD bought via Amazon.com cost 70 USD :P haha..  Then we all head back to the hotel. Stuck in traffic jam but then we rushed like mad. Did last minute packing,showered and got ourselves a cab. George (Ah Kai's friend) was waiting for his Suckling pig (which he will take back to Singapore?!) asked us to go to the airport first. Then we checked in and guess what. Got ourselves upgraded to Business Class with Thai Airways *gosh* So nice surprise. George was quite close of not getting upgraded but in the end got an upgrade too. We were excited and got up the plane. The service was amazing. Better food and more choices (of course). A singaporean lady (who was seated in the business class) asked me how much did I pay for the business class tic while wating with me at the toilet so I told her that we got an Upgrade due to Regina's PPS (SilverKris Priority) card. She envied us and said she had to pay 1000 SGD (yeah we paid 250 SGD for the air tic hehehehe).   Arrived back to Singapore and home sweet home. I do miss BKK and having a person beside me. Eric in fact emailed me a short note, asking me of my flight back to Singapore. I really want this 'butterfly feeling' of liking someone to be out of my system. I'm afraid. I miss talking to my conversational equivalent - Eric Dubois  What should I do?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       I think I just had the nicest time yesterday. Well, I'm quite a simple person. The little pleasures in life make me happy. Seeing others happy - I'm happy :) It just feels precious. Firstly, had quite a nice catch up with Serene whom I've not contact for 2 years. Well, she has been busy with social work and it seems to be a good calling for her! Plus, she told me she's getting married next year in May, Gosh - I'm so so happy for her. Finally found someone whom she can share her life with :)     &nbsp;   Then, had another 'Singapore Idol' Session with my cousins (Clara and Angela) at Kbox Karaoke on Saturday afternoon from 2pm til 7pm. Well, this time it was a good wide spread where all of us could sing equally throughout the time frame. It was so much fun. We felt like kids all over again, prancing and making silly moves to the MTVs heheehe... I think these 2 gals are also excited about their Taipei trip (same day I'll be leaving for BKK) so they are discussing quite a bit too. It's nice to be able to keep in close contact with my cousins (considering I was quite guilty of neglecting them when I was with my ex lol).     &nbsp;   After which I had to Regina's bf place where we all gathered and hanged out. Her boyfriend cooked african food and it was delicious! *yums* Well, it's healthy, spicy and good hehe... Then we were playing african poker (Ban Luck) games for a while. Quite interesting ;) So we headed off around 11nish home. Got home, saw John (My british friend based in NYC) online and we chatted a bit. This sweetie called me on my house phone as I told him it was awhile we chatted *swoons* Ooooh... He is such a doll!! Yeah, he has been my online friend for 4 years. We met twice in our life (once in singapore and 2nd time in NYC when I was there holidaying with Sean).     &nbsp;  Most of the time we communicate via MSN and it's good we can click. He is so generous as he allowed me, clara and Angela to crash in when we are visiting next year July. I tell you, this call from him was like a cherry to the Ice-cream topping...just incredible! (Honestly, the chat we had were like one of those conversations in Sex and the City hehehe...just the difference is that I'm in Singapore and he is in New York, the wonders of technology eh?!) &nbsp; Yes, he will be going on a hot date with this nice asian guy - BOATING ooooh so romantic hehe... I am so happy for him ;) Hope&nbsp;things work out for them...    &nbsp;   Yeah, nice to have passion in life and just living it out! Just inserted my new school semester timetable into my organiser and it looks i'm going to start to get busy soon. I'm glad Jee got a new job in TTSH and seems to keep her nicely busy (as she only has one module this semes). Going to laze more, such a nice sunday!     &nbsp;   Your laziness..

      It's official - this blog is like a weekly column. At least from the feedback I've got from my Best friend (Gerard), my wacky and gorgeous cousin (Clara) and my zany plus funnily bitchy ex-ibm colleague (Carine). So this shows that I cannot be lazy and I need to update it regularly lol... Was just on the line with my cousin and she told me she laughed her head off when she read the previous blog about my reservist experience in Erin Brockovich, but yeah, sometimes -seeing other people's tragedy is one's comedy lol  My boss just left for South Africa yesterday and will be back on the 30th July. Yupe the whole office will be rather empty but I can't wait to do certain organisation to the files/documents and other administration. It's like your work seem to be swarmed by other people's work and not YOUR work?! So it's good that she left for a break. I will also be having a break myself when I head to BKK from 24th til 26th July. I will be my 2nd time since I was there when I was 9 years old :P Well, guess it should have changed quite a bit as I remembered I was stuck in traffic with my dad in the taxi (heading to the airport to pick my mum and bro, but they didn't turn up) for 3 whole hours - ONE WAY! So by the time we got back to the hotel, 6 percious hours are wasted. Guess more flyovers and better road adjustment should make a diff by now in BKK, let's hope..  I can't wait to be mistaken again for a thai lol Well, I think in general we asians can blend into any asian country quite easily as it's hard to differentiate from one another when you don't open your mouth. Guess the koreans must be thinking i'm a snob and hating me for not speaking korean lol Don't play play ok, our looks all very versaltile leh..hehe Having a nice cup of tea and some bread. Well, played scrabble til 6 am last night, still recovering. Quite a nice quiet day.  Anyone keen on asking me out? ;)  B

      Today is the final day of my reservist, thank God! :) But before this nasty day ended - it was soooo much drama before we manage to get out of camp. Maybe you people won't know but army at all times is all about admin. You have to sign this, sign in, sign out and sign sign sign. I mean if not this - guess this world would be a better place?! haha Well, my CSM (Company Sgt Major) appointed me today to get signatures from the various departments in our unit today. I mean we are talking about big shots in the camp - that I've got to get their signature (which is for the clearance that everything is received on their side and we can leave camp officially).   Then this irresponsible guy who does the stores was sick. He lives in SengKang and does not even call anyone to inform them he's not coming. Falls asleep. Ya. Everyone was kept waiting and was wondering what the hell was happening? Everyone (in other companies) have left after an hour but we were stranded there. To make matters worse - the freaking signature was to be accompanied with the consolidation of all the camp-passes (so this guy is missing in action,how can we do clearance?!)   Then, he turns up around 1120 - with a long face (supposedly sick) and unapologetic. Tell you, I was not there but running around like Julia Roberts in her Oscar winning movie Erin Brockovich where she helps the plaintiffs to get signatures to file a petition (but for my case to help the whole Company BOOK OUT as soon as possible). I tell you - it was stressful, of course if I had boobs and cleavage (in army) - it would probably have sped up the process lol  Anyway, the Majors and other high ranking officers were rather nice. I had to PR a bit here and there but it was worth it. Apart from the chicken run, I did not really sleep well (again) as I've been playing online scrabble. I'm such a nerd but haha it's quite addictive ;) Well, I ended up meeting up with Jee and her mum to attend a skin care beauty course. They were introducing face products and boy it was rather amazing. I bought a cleanser and hydrating spray for starters to try out first. Will let you know if it's worth it or not :P hehe..I don't deny it's effectiveness but guess beauty products vary with people so it's hard to gauge at times.  Today is saturday. Spent whole afternoon attending the course and headed home for a short nap. Boy I miss napping hehe.. So i'm awake now and just thought I pen my thoughts before I get hit by more and more other loads of stuff.  Thankfully my aunt, dad's sister (who was based in Jedah) now in Shanghai called and we chatted a bit. She felt apologetic about not being physically here for me when I was undergoing the *jury decision making* of my previous breakup but assured her it was something I had to do myself (apart from listening to other's opinions). Anyway, I can't wait for my break soon...  Maybe I go watch some VCDs now..or get laid? :P  B

      Trust me, there must be a reason why men and women - there is a difference. I'm not trying to segregate both sexes but trying to weigh the pros and cons right now :)   Men =========                               *Need to do National Service   (Army in Sg)     *No periods                                   *More expensive, less choices of   clothes      *Cannot multi-task (unless you   are gay :p)    *Need to be the sole bread-winner             *Answer to every question starts with          NO                                            *Sensitive (with regards to their ego)                                                           Women ============  *DO NOT need to do National Service  *Periods monthly  *In-expensive, More choices of clothes  *Can multi-task  *Can be tai-tai/work/super-mums  *Answer to every question starts with  YES  *Sensitive (with regards to   others/environment)    Let me see - more or less the main points are given ehhe... I guess it's the national service where I've got time to think about such stuff (considering I've been given an excuse of uniform + lower limb for 5 days - til the end of my training as I've got a swollen lump on my calves). Well, it's initally a scary thing for me to visit my Unit's Medical Officer (Doctor) as I tell you - these guys hmmm...are quite something. When some recruits who were sick, visited the medical centre - never reported their name/rank properly to these Medical Officers, they were made to do 20 push-ups on the spot!? I think it's stupid and ridiculous; I mean these guys are already SICK :(  Anyway, I slept at 9 pm yesterday as I need to get up at 5:30 am to get ready to get into camp in Yishun (nee soon camp). It's like 7 stops via the east plus 12 stops via the North (altogether 19 stops) then I need to take a feeder bus to the outside of the camp then..walk in. Yeah, journey to the NORTH..  Though with my current health condition, I've been blessed. But the Sergeants (which shares the same rank as me) are giving me a kind of look - like i'm trying to ditch responsiblity by being sick or something Yeah, whatever, i don't care anymore.. I am genuinely sick and too BAD. Of course, I don't on purpose laze around and help out as much as admin stuff (since i can't do streneous) from today onwards til thursday. Friday would be some Unit day where we chill out at SAFRA (Yishun AGAIN). So it's more or less the end of this reservist for this working year *phew*  School is starting on 19th July and collecting textbooks on 15th July, can't WAIT. Ok, going to upload some pics I took of Jee, Mike and Me at Alley Bar. We were chilling out with her bf's friends. Funner!  Muacks

      TGIF - yeah, it must be in a lot of people's mind. Am sitting at Jee's home now and had quite a nice afternoon so far. I actually posted my blog yesterday but guess it got hanged, nothing took place. Well, how should I recap what I've been through this week hmmm...   Monday, met up with Sean and Christian (sean's german good friend who is based in Seoul) pop by... We had dinner and coffee. Yeah, it was fun. Felt like ages we've all met - the last time X-mas in Austria 2002 when I visited Sean n his family. Christian thinks whenever me n Sean talk, we are bickering but hehe...that's our normal lingual. Christian should be heading to KL with Sean as he has not been there, would be fun for him!   Tuesday, when everything went bersek in Singapore for about 2 hours (negotiable in various areas). Yeah, when something was inside 'something' (regards to human anatomy), I think the lights went off in the other parts of Singapore lol :P My brother was trying to call me on my mobile but I had it off (as my batt was dying). Tell you, he was calling me but hey, What can i DO?! Errr hehe...  It was good long night. Was showing clif all the pervious pics I took and going down a bit of memory lane (for me).  Wednesday, Chicken rice at Chinatown - I tell you - so cheap and delicious... The tofu is freaking nice. It melts in your mouth literally... The bean sprouts (tao gay) was like super duper nice too.. Aiyoh, we must all go there again. My fav haunt right now :)  Thursday, just staying at home. Nice to be at home and just not do anthing. Thought they were going to show the O.C. but bloody hell got the stupid soccer match?! arrghh  So just watch some VCD on my laptop and just chill by myself. My uncle last minute invited us for seafood at east coast. It was yummy hehe.. Thank God for gym, or else i'm turning chunky soon lol  Am hungry now siah... Update u later..  Bought quite a nice red top from Zara, hey - Zara got sale from today until the next 3 weeks hehe...  Buy away  B

      Can't really sleep but am tired really. I was rushing like mad in the gym today in order to beat the gym 'bunnies' to the bench presses. They'll pump iron and then drop the weights with a loud heave. Then, admire themselves in the mirror. I mean, do they have to do that all the time?! Talk about vanity 'lair' lol I think the gym culture has been seeing much increase in members nowadays. It seems what the advertisments and magazines dictate - it is the ultimate bible for the mass audience. I can't seem to be like them, killing myself over 2 hours in there like there's no tommorrow. Life is short already. I don't intend to 'kill' myself. The gym is a good place to keep fit - lean. Have realistic bodies. Not stick thin wafer female bods or killer brad pitt bod (in Troy which i refuse to see as the review I've got from everyone is "Brad pitt has a good bod"; what sort of a movie review is it!? ) .  Enough of bodies. I just want my tired body to sleep soon. Trying to break the 2am sleep timing but I can't seem to do it. It's like I'm becoming a vampire. I wish I could turn into a bat and fly over to various countries; suck people's blood (and also other 'things') hehe.. The only thing that has been sucking my blood is the tonnes of assignments for my upcoming 3 modules for my school. I'm doing Online Journalism (which has been postponed like twice, no lecturer confirmed and seems we will be slotted on Sunday's 9am Arrrgh), Radio and Television Journalism (where i get a young lady lecturer who thinks she's funny; speaks with a monotonous tone that puts all to sleep) and finally Media Text (interestingly Murdoch Uni graduate; Cheryl Fox (also Charlotte in SATC) look-a-like chinese 27yr old gal whose having a hard time dealing with students in my school). Well, we had a presentation about representations during Media Text. Communication subjects is the best time to 'smoke'. Seriously, I'm blessed and fortunate during presentations. I remembered when I was in my secondary school. I hardly can form or finish a sentence like a snap. Smoked my way through like a breeze today and I thought to myself. Why can't I just speed through with the rest of my life like the way how I 'smoked' in class? *sighs*  Gosh, maybe life is like a cocktail where you need the right concoctions. What is the right ingredients anyway? There is no right stuff. Who tells you that it's right or wrong? I'm sure the blind man in Orchard road would tell you it's right to help him. But when I did help him up the stairs (me filled with sympathy and kindess) - he said "NO".  He said "I don't need your help, just give me money." For a moment, I just stunned. He in fact used his disability to get someone's attention and then expects them to pay for the tissues which he was selling. Do you think his actions were low-down or that's what people do for survival? When my galfrd was harassed in Bangkok by money boys - telling them how beautiful they were, how they would send them off with flowers and fruits, fondling them topped with sweet nothings - have the world become a place what we think it is?  Not sure if I shared the cab shocking experience which I got recently with you guys. But I took a cab to Sengkang with $12.00 to meet a friend. Turns out when I took the cab back, it was $22.00. Why? Simply, the cab driver refuse to listen to my instructions to take the expressway and my directions which I gave. He took me for a ride around Singapore - I was slightly tired keeping quiet. Then when he stopped me in front of my home (which I've already travelled Up North, Central and finally east) - he ask me to pay up. I look at him with horror and said. Let me ask you. When I gave you directions to take the TPE to take me home from Sengkang, why didn't you take it? He replied "Oooh really, did u say it?" Well, Yes I did say it. Anyway, thanks for the ride you gave me around Singapore but you deserve $12.00, which I paid the last cab driver. Bye. I walked away, pissed and glad (that I never gave in). Yeah, comfort drivers - you have not seen the last of them...  I'm not sure what the chicken rice seller (a.k.a. part-time fortune teller) said when I was going to move mid of next year. Maybe I'm just tired with what is around me. Guys are either taken or cheating. Please, can I just be a plant - at least I'm asexual; not worried about sex :P   Greens for you during lunch, anyone?

      A new club, Happy, opened yesterday and so I went. Housing 500 people (as compared to Taboo, the usual haunt for most pink men - holding only 200 men, more smokey and crowded) - it was more spacious and music was not too bad. I enjoy a nice space and place to manuever. You could see the crowd picking up and people cutting in. I have always wondered - how do these people get into the 'list'? They smile, give each other kisses on their cheeks *muacks muacks* and then say "Oh you look fabulous"... In they go. Yes, looks like contact with people are essential to get around these days. It's like a monopoly - 'Bail out of Jail' card.  When you start to observe the crowd. It is as though everyone would give you a look - analysing what you were wearing, how you did your hair, your body shape, etc... Has superficiality reached saturation. I mean you obviously can't tell a person's personality/intelligence/character just from one look. You have to wait til the other person to open his mouth, chat a while and then you can probably get a clue of that person. How much can you know from a person from an hour, 12 hours, 1 day, 6 months or even 1 year? I mean I never knew what my ex really wanted after 2 years - yeah, that's a long time. So in fact, why do people just keep things to themselves? Does communication becomes compromised or reduced when you know more about one another?  I did the brave thing in order to make my (from my last blog) closure with Eric more proper - call him. Yes, I got up at 1430. I called Eric. He picked up (considering I did call him 2 times and he never picked up). Yes, just like the last time (when I first called him before I went to Bangkok) - bad reception. Sometimes I wonder if bad reception means we are not meant to talk hehe... Even when I was in bangkok (using a bangkok SIM card); mind you local to local eh. Also bad reception. Our conversation went like this.  Me : Hey, how are you? It's Brendan.  Eric: I'm good thank you.  Me: Oh just called to see how you were and hope you are doing well  Eric: I'm okie. Just hungry and going to meet sister bemas for lunch soon He has sms me a lot and i didn't reply him.  Me: Did u by chance get my 2 emails? Not sure if you replied as my work email sometimes cannot work as people have emailed me and it bounced.  Eric: Yes I did get your 2 emails thank you. The first one and the second one with the picture link. I saw the pictures. They came out very nicely. And your second email ended asking me I was an email person. Sorry, as I've been busy. No time to reply. Will try reply soon.   Me: Oh i see...  Eric: So what are your plans today?  Me: Errm nothing much. Probably just laze at home.  Eric: I see  Me: I may be heading up to bangkok with another bunch of friends soon, August. Mid august I think.  Eric: Oh okie. You can drop me a line and we could catch up.  Me: Yes. Shouldn't be a problem.  Eric: So how's work?  Me: Oh well, boss is coming back soon. Got settled with the admin which has been dragged for a while.  Eric: Yeah, read that in your second email. You wrote that.  Me: Anyway, I guess the reception is killing our conversation.  Eric: Yes, let's communicate via email or we speak in person,it's better this way.  Me: Okie you take care, Ciao  Eric: Thanks for calling and talk soon. Bye   After going through the conversation. Eric has not give me any hope of what may happen with him. But just gave me a nice ending to what I've been through. I misunderstood him twice (the last time was the SMS and this time with regards to the emailing). Eric is just like Mr Big in SATC. He is strange and he does things accordingly to his time. I'm not sure if I'm a masochist. But it seems the guys I like are seriously strange. Weird guys. Silent brooding guys are attractive to me haha I am damn sure this guy will forget replying my email. No more expectations. Now, I will learn to love myself more (which have been quite successful so far). Loving myself is the best. If I don't lick my own wounds, who would?  Going to Bangkok. My itinerary with Eric would be simply just better the second round. NO, am not doing the sucidal thing. When my mind is tuned to the just *uck mode, I won't get emotional. It's as simple as that. Well, you think I'm cold. But I think I need to protect myself more than anything else now.  P.S. Clif (that Qantas Flight Attendant) broke up with his boyfriend yesterday. Yes, that's a miracle. Don't worry, not interested in him hehehe...
