      I am currently doing programming for my dad's company which will be used for record conversion from legacy applications to a new Sequel database.  My language of choice is Java, simply because I can "easily" manufacture graphical interfaces if needed, and that I'm current with the syntax.  I just don't have the time or motivation to learn C++ better than I do now.  Most of the stuff I'm writing wouldn't benefit from the fabled performance increases C++ has over Java.  For the programming I'm doing for Sesame Place, I've been using Visual Basic since FujiFilm seems to use it as their language of choice for more serious programs, and also because it would allow me to create a user interface that would be easily understandable by the most computer-illiterate of ABAP employees.  For the "programming" I'm doing on the side, I'm going to be converting hard copies of forms to digital templates through the usage of HTML and some sort of proprietary database linkage.  I guess I'll learn more about it when I actually get some forms to try out.

      I just recieved an email from Andy Vineberg about my acceptance to the panel of the reality section of the Courier Times!  I'm extremely excited about having the opportunity to have more of my work published...maybe I should get started on more of that :)

      I'm tired and no one is around.  Good day at Sesame, everything went smoothly but it was really busy.  My damn program still isnt quite working, but I'll get it straightened out eventually.  My schedule got changed next week and I almost flipped out, but the days I needed off were still there so all is good.  I have to do all my AP US History outlining tomorrow and then go to BC^3 with Moj on Monday to pull some primary sources to analyze.  Should be fun.  I got paid today which was pretty nice, total $560 deposit which always makes me smile :)  Looks like I'm going to stop ranting and maybe do alittle APUSH work...who knows.

      Got off tonight at 10:30 because of a Season pass holder event. I  thought  that i had finished the program for incentive tracking at sesame, but apparently I was wrong. I just finished it as I type this, and added more versatility too. It now has a configuration program that comes along with it to set the network paths it should look at and it also now counts the number of pictures sold per job on an original bracelet.   I'll test it out tomorrow when I work 10:30 - 7 down at 123 Smile.  Speaking of which, I need to burn a Guster CD for MaryJo...  Never seems like there are enough hours in a day.

      Second day in a row closing, and getting home around 10 at night.  I've got to close tomorrow (payday) and then work the middle shift on Saturday, but when I get back Saturday no one is going to be around to hang out with when I finally have time.  Sunday I finally have a day off, and I think the schedule for next week is changing.  Oy vey.  I think I finally finished the program I was writing to Sesame incentive programs for the line employees in Photo.  I'm still debating whether or not to allow them to use it since I'm probably not going to get paid for the time I put into it.  Maybe I'll email a copy to FujiFilm and August Busch.  See, incentive is everything - no money, no program (maybe).  Sadly, a corporation which employs thousands of people can't understand that.

      Where to start.  I'm a supporter of Bush, sometimes outspoken, sometimes not. Being raised as a Catholic, morality has always been part of my life, despite rarely attending church in the last year or two. Work ethic is also extemely important to me, and I firmly believe in individualism and capitalism for this reason. I also firmly believe in defense of the nation.  What I don't understand about the present period of time is the amount of personal hatred directed towards the President. Why is the vocal minority (read: the left) taking Bush's being in office so personally? And the comparisons to Hitler are just horrendous. Last time I checked Bush wasn't rounding up any ethnic groups and killing them en masse, a la Hitler. The disagreement on issues does not equate hatred for one another, and the usage of military force does not make a leader Hitler-esqe.  I support Bush's "War on Terrorism" not from being a "blind loyalist" but as a well-educated individual. Regardless of Iraq's involvement with the 9/11 attacks, Saddam required consequence for his actions in the past. Hell, even both presidential candidates agree with each other that they still would have gone to war in Iraq based on today's intelligence. It was the right thing to do, and WMD was only one part of the reasons to go to war, along with the liberation of the Iraqi people from a tyrrant who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people with chemical munitions in the 1980's. UN Resolutions in the Security Council approving the war were vetoed by none other than those countries who were engaged corrupt oil for food programs with Iraq. Saddam also supported the families of Palestinian suicide bombers which is simply staggering to say he wasn't tied to terrorism. Even if he had no signifigant ties to one group, his being in power was a beacon of anti-American sentiment in the mid-East who would probably aid terrorist factions.  I just don't feel that Kerry can handle the war, and keep pressure on the Islamo-fascists of the world would would love to see every woman wearing a burka. I feel Kerry's stance is that which is appeasement of the international community.  As for the cost of Freedom at home, I disagree with some of the Patriot Act. The ability to detain anyone and deny them access to a lawyer is rather scary. However, there are clauses in the Patriot Act which do allow the government a deal more flexibility in information sharing between bureaus. However, I refuse to blame only Bush for the Patriot Act due to the two houses of Congress and the Supreme Court which allow a beautiful thing called checks and balances. Freedom is more important than security, however, I'll spare the use of an overused Benjamin Franklin quote that we all know by now.  I will not criticize the government for sending out terror level warnings, because before 9/11 it was that the government didn't do enough.  The hypocrisy spouted by critics of the terror alerts hurts my head.  Now it's just the opposite, that the terror alerts are a "fascist attempt to keep everyone living in fear".  I, for one, feel safer now, and do not worry at all about terror attacks.   Abortion. I disagree strongly with abortions past the first trimester, unless of course in cases of rape, or cases in which the life of the mother is threatened by the birth of a child.  Stem Cell Research is going to be the next medical revolution, and I'm excited about it, which is why I'm disappointed with Bush's ban on stem cell research.  I also strongly disagree with an Amendment banning gay marriage. The Bill of Rights was designed to protect the rights of citizens, not restrict them. Gay marriage bans also step into the grey area at which lies the combination of church-based morals and state.  The economy is strengthening. I cannot believe that people blame Bush alone for the amount of jobs lost. His unemployment rate is that of Clinton's when he left office in 2001. Remember the 90's and the artificial stock market bubble created by web start ups? Yeah, it popped, and we're only starting to recover. The economy is a cyclical thing so ups and downs are expected. Greenspan, who is as nonpartisan as you can get, even thinks that the lull in the summer months is only temporary.  Interest rates have been the lowest in 40 years during Bush's term, home ownership is up.  Jobs are returning, if Bush leaves office this year on an economic high note that continues rising, Kerry will probably get the credit for it.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who would read this and still say "Fuck Bush". You can't please everyone.

      Pay day on Friday - but only 1 week worth of hours since I was in the Outer Banks. Today I had rough day at Sesame with all sorts of technology ceasing to work. Printers not accepting paper, kiosks crashing, not-so-bright employees, sups quitting, angry guests, rain - could there be anything else? I try my best, so whatever happens, happens. I've also seemingly finished the program I designed to handle tracking of the number of pictures printed per photographer and hopefully the backbone of an incentive system. I'd have to say it sucks that Anheuser-Busch can't pay it's employees extra like the incentive program due to fairness between departments and parks. Maybe I should start an amusement photographers union. I'm just rambling now.  Regardless of my day at work, I'm still in a pretty good mood with 19 days before school starts. I still haven't really touched my AP US History work yet, but it'll eventually get done I'm sure - maybe Friday or Sunday when I have time to do something about it. College apps are also creeping up on me but I'd like to get those done early so I don't have to worry about them during school. So far Bucknell seems to be on the top of my list and then maybe the other schools I liked from Viriginia like UVA, W&M and possibly U of Richmond. Time seems to be the enemy lately, though.  I'm still looking for used computers/hardware to mess around with. I'm hoping that I can possibly make my computer service/repair gig into a more profitable and consistent work experience too. Currently, I'm charging $10/hr for my services but I'm thinking more like $15 would be appropriate. Seems like most of the work I do is spyware removal or trivial computer setups. Rarely I've had to reinstall machines or replace hardware. I'm fighting the urge to blow my next paycheck on more hardware, so the only place I'll be picking stuff up from is friends or computer recycling centers. Hopefully my dad's clients are effectively using the piece of software I wrote for record conversion so that he can think up more programs for me to write during the school year.  I'm hoping I'll get an email from the guy running the Reality section of the Courier Times soon to know if I'm on the board. Even if I'm not I plan to write more editorials for submission anyway. Hell, I have like 5 more to submit and I heard good things from the first one. Perhaps something on the upcoming elections will be the next piece. Right now though, I'll stick to blogging.  Maybe this blog will be a testing ground for my work.
