      I'm gonna go insane. Well, probably not. But I feel like I am.   I'm wasting my hours away to stupid games and doing absolutely nothing. I don't know why I always end up playing games when I know I could be doing something much more productive.   My latest addiction is a free online game called Runescape. (www.runescape.com) It's the worst game I've ever played. But I can't stop going back to it. I dunno why. I mean, it seems to collect the stupidest people I've ever seen on one game. The n00bs are incredibly irritating...the elite assholes are a pain..and..I really have no idea why I play that game. Oh well.   Anyway. My name on there is The_Thiefess, if you ever want to find me. I normally play on World 20 because that's where the people I know are at.  So. Let's see. Something to write about...  Ooh.  Every summer, I always go through a I-want-to-start-a-garden phase. My Mom normally goes out and gets lots of flowers and stuff like that, and then I decide that I want my own little garden. And we go get some flowers and herbs that I like..such as basil, greek oregano, snapdragons, and..all sorts of things. It's fun. But, after about a week, I get bored of that lil' project and move onto something else. It's aggravating. I can never stay with one "project" for any long period of time. I just seem to lose focus and start thinking up ideas for something else to do. And even if I test myself, by doing some activity just to see how long I can do it for...well, I always end up forgetting about it or being distracted. Sometimes I really feel like I have some weird form of ADD =p Well, most of the time I just feel like I'm paranoid. But every now and then I feel like I have ADD. So. enh.  An example of my problem with projects...well, there's always my procrastination with projects that are forced on me. But I'm talking about projects that I start and never finish. Oh! I used to be on a chat-program called Furcadia all the time. The site is www.furcadia.com if you're interested. You're basically an animal that can chat with other people-animal things and there's absolutely no point. But it's a lot of fun.  Anyway. You can make your own dream in furcadia. A dream is a map of your own little world, in simple terms. You can make patches to make pretty, extra graphics and use DragonSpeak to do HTML-ish stuff. It's difficult to explain. In any case, I used to have all these wonderful ideas for dreams. I would start planning how they would look..and what patches I would use..and what bots to make...and I would get started and work on my dream for hours on end. However...eventually, normally when I got half-way finished..I would start thinking up ideas for another dream and just completely forget about my current dream. And...that would go on for a long time. It was frustrating, to say the least.   I loved Furc, though. It just seems that Furcadia attracted a certain type of person that...if you get along with one person there, you get along with nearly all of them. Nearly everyone is intelligent in their own way...and everyone's funny and...oh, I suppose I was just spoiled by that chat program. Because..comparing the type of people on Furc..to Runescape..agh. It makes me want to go back to Furcadia..which is really bad. heh. I can't even begin to count how many hours of my life I wasted to that pointless game XD Well, it's not even a game. There is no point. At all. Whoo! Rock on.  Oooookay. Where was I? Oh. Gardening. That's kind of sad, how far off topic I got. heheh. Anyway. So my Mom had to go get some plants and I was slowly but steadily getting back into my I-wanna-start-a-garden mood and I kept asking her about all these different plants and..well..when I decided on what I wanted, she wouldn't give in. enh. I mean, come on..it'd be a lot of fun to have a Weeping Willow. Or a rose bush. Those are just cool plants. Weeping Willows are just...well..really cool. And the rose bush I wanted was a "Yellow Tea Hybrid" or something and it was neat. But nooooo. We couldn't get either of those. bleh. And when I just said I wanted a little basil plant or a greek oregano..noooo...  It's probably for the best, though. ^^; I don't have a green thumb. Well, rather, I've never stuck with gardening long enough to know if I have a green thumb. At least, it's very pink right now. Pink-ish. Kind of tan. Stupid summer. I always get a horrible farmer's tan due to tennis.  I think I'll just flood this little journal with lots of quizilla stuff later. I love quizilla ^_^  Oh, and every time I post I'll try to put at the bottom the song that's been stuck in my head all day. I always have a song stuck in my head for at least one day at a time..sooo.  Song stuck in my head today: Holding Out for a Hero (Shrek 2 Soundtrack) by - Frou Frou, Jennifer Saunders, and the original (that I dislike) is by Bonnie Tyler, I think. I get my music from Limewire so the names aren't always...ehm..accurate.

      I am so very weak. Or at least, I feel so very weak. I have finally given in to this silly fad of "blogging" stuff that nobody cares about. Yay.   I've decided to do this because.. 1. It's fun to read some of the few interesting blogs I've seen. I just need to remember to fill this thing up with inside jokes and stupid stuff like that. Nobody cares 'bout that kind of info. 2. I need to keep a journal of some sort. If only to be able to read back over previous emotions and moodswings..in any case, if I stick with this, it'll hopefully help me get a better control over myself. 3. It's only my second day out of school and I'm already incredibly bored. Sooo..why not start a blog?  Listing stuff always makes me feel better. ^_^ I'm one of those people that organizing and cleaning helps produce endorphins just like exercising and that sort of stuff does.   I wonder who made up the word endorphin. That's just a really weird word. Wierd. Weird. Ok yeah.  Anyway.  To those of you who know me...some of these posts will make more sense than to random people just looking for time to waste by reading a stranger's blog. But...I don't know if I'm going to even give out this link to my friends. And I have no idea if this will be something worthwhile to people that don't know me. enh.  I guess this is good enough for a first post. I'll probably write more later, considering there's nothing else to do and I'm already feeling bored again, just by the fact that I'm ending this post..oy..

      So. I've been hooked on Age of Mythology lately. It's fun to play online. Well, mostly fun. The stupid people..they're not so fun. And the laggers. And the people that bail, five minutes into the game. Ok ok ok the cons outweight the pros e.e And that's probably why I'm my little play-AoM-24/7 spree is about to end..or I'm going to make it end..  I got a little..furious..this afternoon. I was playing a rated game against a guy who used an incredibly cheap trick and rushed my village at the very beginning of the game. I barely stayed in there..I made new towncenters and lots of migdol structures (was playing as egyptian..Isis, actually)..but eventually my resources were gone and there was no point to keep on playing, since he kept killing off almost all of my people, in which I would have to rebuild in another remote location on the map..again. So I resigned. The after-battle conversation: Him: gg (good game) Me: That was not a good game. That was a cheap trick that you used at the beginning. Him: so u r a girl? Me: Don't try and hit on me because I'm really pissed off right now... Him: how old r u? Me: AGGH Me: DAMMIT  And I left in a very bad mood ^_^ Was very angry to find out that my punching bag downstairs has been taken down and that I didn't have anything to take my anger out on.   heh. And now I'm angry again. Too much testosterone in online games..bleh. There needs to be more girl gamers >  I think I'm gonna go find some stupid quizzes to put in this blog now..

      Enh. I won my first match, and lost my second. I was playing excellent-ish-ly this morning. I just got lazy after lunch o.-;  I don't really mind losing, though. I lost to a person that was nice. And she was polite and showed all the right courtesy for a tennis match. The other girl, though...agh.  1. She tried to hit me. Many times. When I would turn around to go back to serve and she had gone to get me a ball and was throwing it over, well, let's just say I had to dodge the ball a few times. "Oh...sorry" yeah right -_-  2. She questioned my calls, after she kept hitting them out and they were about a foot from the line and..oh, I don't know. But..well, after the match, my Mom said "It's a really good thing she said that, because I knew you would be so pissed off that you would actually start playing." And she was right e.e That's my ultimate pet peeve. I mean, I try very hard to keep my line calls right. Occasionally I'll just let one slide, if I'm not really sure about it. Aggh.  3. The people there to support her kept clapping when I would hit a ball into the net. My Mom did that a few times, at my first matches. I glared at her..a lot. I cannot stand it when people do this. It's okay to clap if someone hits a winner, or a really good shot. But..clapping just because a ball went out, or went into the net? That's my other ultimate pet peeve in tournament matches. It gave me enough anger to win, at least e.e;  4. Ok..the first set was 6-2, me. She was coming back in the second set and we were tied 5-5, and a couple of times she kept holding onto the tennis balls because she figured that the game was over..like..it would be 40-0, her. My serve. And instead of giving them to me, she would keep them because she just assumed that the game would be over the next point and..enh. I was just angry o.x;  Anyway. I won..6-2, 5-7, 10-6. I won the first set, she won the second set (I kept kind of screaming "NOOOOOOoooooooooooo" in my head during those last points), and then she just lost it when we did the 10-point tiebreaker. That was when the clapping was at its worst, and her "Oh my GOD come ON Caroline! GET IT TOGETHER!" peptalks were also at their worst. ^_^ It makes me laugh when people talk to themself like that, even though I know I do it too. heheh.   Oh yeah. My second game I lost 6-2, 6-0. x.x; Like I said, I got really lazy. And really tired. I'm out of shape >  I think I'm gonna go sleep now. Or just wander the net aimlessly. Neither of those require the use of my brain so..yeah.  Song for today: Pass That Dutch by Missy Elliott heheh. I found this by looking for the Mean Girls soundtrack. I like Missy Elliott's music ^^; My favorite part is near the end, when it sounds like the water-pipe part of Stomp.

      too much family togetherness today. and too much chocolate. which leads to too many moodswings.  I'm in a very depressed mood right now, when I was just in a very happy mood about..oh..ten minutes ago. There are a few reasons for my sudden depression that I can easily name, though...  1. I've had to deal with my two sets of grandparents since 10 this morning till 8 p.m. It's very exhausting, answering the same questions every time when we're with the grandparents that practically have alzheimer's/dementia, and being at the second grandparents' house, I'm always criticized for every little thing I do. I hate these kinds of days..father's day..mother's day..well, basically any sort of day that I'm forced to go visit relatives and get no gifts in return. I've also had to deal with my parents in the car. Sometimes I wish they would just divorce already. They fight over every little thing, and it's not the kind of nice fighting where people apologize in the end and make-up. It's just..enh. It's enough of a warning for me to not want to ever marry, at least. I don't understand marriage. I mean, normally people "fall in love" because they talk to a person a lot and...well, if you're stuck with a person long enough, your mind can normally force you to find some positive aspect about them. But that being-together-ness for...say, twenty-five years? It's enough to drive anyone insane. The idea of marriage is just fucked up, in my opinion o.-; But then, I'm having some raging hormone-induced thoughts right now that are also triggered by my overdosing on chocolate after I had lunch today..  2. I had a  lot  of chocolate. Chocolate leads to most of my chaotic moodswings. I'll probably be feeling either quite happy in a few minutes, or angry at the world, or just very sulky and sullen. I dunno.  3. I was reading  Trickster's Choice  by Tamora Pierce today, in order to avoid most of the pathetic attempts at conversation that my family tries on me. I love Pierce's books, but they just...leave me feeling so incomplete. Right now, I'm pretty much yearning for my own Nawat Crow and wishing I could live in Tortall. >  4. I have a tournament tomorrow in Winston that..the girls in my category..well, almost all of them have beaten me once. It's..blehhh. wish me luck -_-  Ok. After typing all that, I feel better now. I think I'm just going to publish this without reading over it, because if I read over it, I know I'm going to edit some stuff.  Song for today: Hello Somebody by Handsome Devil I've only been able to find this song, and Makin' Money by a group called Handsome Devil..and I love both of the songs ^^; I wish I could find more, though. hn. I love the part.."If I seem a little rude, please excuse me, I was raised on the dark side"..XD The twinge of vibrato their lead singer has makes the songs great.

      So. I'm still here at journalism camp. Even though I'm here for literary magazine...it's just easier to refer to it as Journalism Camp. Whoo.  Right now, my fellow literary-magazine people are using PageMaker to create layouts. I'm thoroughly confused and quite lost, since I've never used the program before. I've had fun tinkering with it, though. It's just getting a little boring. Sooo I felt like writing on here.  And..I have nothing to ramble on about. I could vent my anger about how  wrong  our literary magazine is, as I've found from the lecture things I've been sitting through..but..I can save that until tomorrow when I get home.  I'm kind of homesick, but really I just wish I could be with some people I know. I don't mind being placed in situations where I'm basically on my own and have to make friends..it's ok, if I'm in a good mood. But I had to deal with new people last week..and this week I'm outnumbered, and out of my area of..expertise, I suppose. Tennis camp is..a lot different than journalism camp, to say the least. At least I can still look forward to going back there in a few weeks and working on my slice with Juan Nunez. Yay!  I started reading  The Joy Luck Club  by Amy Tan this morning. I like it a lot. Chinese stuff interests me. And now that I think about the Chinese culture, I always remember the bracelet I nearly always wear that's on my arm right now. It's a jade bracelet, with jade that's truly from China. It used to be very green, but it's just kind of white now, with a faint, green tinge to it. It's got a really neat way of adjusting, but it would be kind of hard for me to describe it. The string is like..no other string in the US, really. You can only get it from China. My Mom's already tried looking for it..many times. The red string stands for Luck, and the green jade has a kind of interesting..background. Supposedly, it's a way to protect people. Well, rather, if you wear jade, and it breaks..then you "know" that the jade saved you from a situation that might have killed you. It's hard for me to explain. I can be superstitious at times, which absolutely no sense..but..whenever I'm going into a completely new place and environment (ex: Journalism camp), it's just comforting to wear it. It has also helped me through many tests XD   Something to talk about...something..to..type and ramble on about, rather. Ummm. Ok. I give up. It's almost time to go, anyway.  I'll try to put in some big posts when I get home. ^^;

      I'm at UNC! Whoo hoo! But I'm not posting anything really important on my blog because everyone can see this, like Justin who's watching over my shoulder. And I'm sure Alexander will join him soon at looking at the screen so..forget that.  Journalism Camp is fun. Uh...coming here for literary magazine was the best idea I've had in a while, I suppose. And Justin just said it wasn't my idea, and now, like I knew he would, Alexander is looking at the screen. Ok I need to end this.

      Yay. My brain is working now. I've gotten over the whole..longing-for-camp mood thing now. I've now moved onto an apprehensive mood about going to journalism camp tomorrow, but mainly because I have no idea what to expect.  I've been spoiled by Brenda's. I mean, last week there were only nine campers there. We had five counselors. And then one camper left, so..yeah. We got to do practically anything we wanted. It was  so  nice. And now that I'm going to UNC for this camp...I just dunno. I don't know how many kids will be there..I have no idea what KIND of people will be there...I just..have absolutely no idea. So. It scares me a little. But I'm still riding on my energy-high from tennis camp so I think it'll carry into tomorrow and keep me happy enough to be able to deal with some new people and a new environment.  Today has been really boring, though. I went and got some stuff for "camp"..like a notebook, a pack of floppy disks, a new clock..and some food, of course. Something about eating healthy at Brenda's camp and exercising so much..it just got me really guilty yesterday, after eating fastfood and getting soda and chocolate. So, I think I'll just going to try to keep myself from eating that stuff..as much as possible. I even had a salad today for lunch ^_^ And it was my own little masterpiece..it wasn't that bad, either. Some lettuce and spinach..(rabbit-food-ish stuff..enh)..mushrooms..chicken..feta cheese...Greek salad dressing..and, voila. It was all healthy. Whoo. I had some bread with my salad, too..and some muenster cheese ^_^ I love that stuff.   Ooh. I started making a quizilla quiz today. I got very aggravated when the editor kept freezing, though, so I haven't finished it. But..when I do finish it, I'll put up a link. I've got all the questions and answers typed in, though. I just need to find some pics.   Hm. Hopefully I'll be able to update my blog at UNC, but..like I said..I have no idea what to expect from this camp thingie. I guess I'll find out everything tomorrow. Maybe I'll make some more friends. More likely, I'll make some more enemies. heheh. Oh well XD  Ok I'm gonna go try and finish my quiz now. Oh yeah..I was looking up some more summer camps because I kind of want to find one on webdesigning and eventually I found  urlLink this  site. There are programs at UNC so..hm. I'm probably going to order a camp catalog thing. It looks interesting. I would have one hell of a time deciding between the Web Design & Graphic Arts program and the Video Game Creation one >  Song for today: Without Me by Eminem (Someone sang this on Kareoke Night at camp..normally I hate Eminem's music. And this song just popped in my head yesterday when my Mom was driving me home from camp yesterday...heh. Guess who's back in Mount Airy. w007!)

      Camp..was great. As always. And now I'm incredibly homesick for camp..which is really aggravating. As soon as I finished checking somethings online here at home, I said to my Mom, "Ok..I'm ready to go back to camp now."  I'm very happy because..camp was a lot of fun. And I made some new friends! Yay for me! But..I'm just so sad because I love that place. It's really hard for me to explain. I always love going there and it just makes me so happy and..bleh..I'm rambling on.   So. A few things that happened..  -Went and saw The Chronicles of Riddick (good movie, but made little sense since we missed the first fifteen minutes)  -Made friends with my counselor after first asking her if she got her shirt from Roots (It was a shirt with just the word "Canada" on it..kind of like the one I have)..and from there, we just had a lot of interesting conversations. Lets see..I found out that her parents are from Romania, which was great, because I got her to teach me a few new phrases..and told her some that I know that I've learned from my own family. And then Brenda (Brenda Schultz McCarthy..it's her camp =p) told us how Karine (that's her name) dated Andy Roddick before he made it big which..that was really interesting.   -Made friends with a guy named C.J. from DC who..just reminded me of a lot of people. Part of him reminded me of my stand partner in symphony, in personality and the same age thing. Part of him reminded me of my best friend, Aaron (which was a good thing)..but then  another  part of him reminded me of my neighbor, Cole, which is not necessarily a good thing. He was fun to talk to, though. I needed someone like that. Otherwise I would've gone insane from listening to the girls in my cabin talking about what they were going to wear each day and..oy. And he had the same PS2 games as me ^_^ Lotsa common interests, which was fun. Yay.   -I got a lot more..tan. yeah. Whoopee.  -My tan lines are now a whole lot worse. yeah. Whoopee.  -Had a lot of fun ^_^  Can't think of anything else to write about. I just..miss camp now. Maybe going to journalism camp on Monday..or whenever I go..that'll hopefully get my mind off of tennis camp. hm.

      Ok. Major headache. Will try my best so this post makes sense. hn.   Went and saw some movies last night. heheh. At the Drive-In! Whoo! One of the few left =p The first movie was "13 Going On 30" at 9..which my mom thought it was starting at 7..we still went, though. That movie was okay..it was cute..and all sweet 'n stuff..with just all..cute-humor and stuff..ok can't really explain it.   But the movie I really wanted to see was "Mean Girls"..ok still dunno if quotations are right for movies or italicization so just..enh. Mean Girls was really good ^_^ Really funny. The best part was at the beginning, when whats-her-name described homeschooled kids and there were those kids sitting on a tractor, explaining parts of religion and..yeah..ok that was just the best. There were a lot of really good jokes. I laughed...a lot =p  So.  Like I said..some other time..I go to tennis camp..well, today. I leave around 2:30..and..will be back home sometime this coming Saturday. I think. And then I go to journalism camp. And..yeah. Ok. Busy week. Er, busy week(s).   I'm looking forward to tennis camp ^_^ I just got new Rook cards since I lost my old deck..and a new deck of normal cards..one of the best things about camp is that everyone knows a lot of card games..well, normally. And we just play cards..a lot. Yaaaay.  Well, we all need something like that to just..have fun and play around. Considering we play about four/five hours of tennis every day..enh x.x;   It looks like it's supposed to rain a lot this week in Woolwine...heheh..Woolwine, Virginia is where the camp is at. If it rains a lot, that means we'll probably play on the indoor court or go see a movie or go bowling or go to the skating rink or..well..we have a lot of options. The great city of Martinsville is close by the camp, so we have plenty of stuff to do =p  Ok..since  urlLink Jeremy  is a "cute but psycho" happy bunny and  urlLink Jacob  is a "kiss my ass" happy bunny..I had to find out what I was..so..I am..     you are the "I hate you so bad" happy bunny. You hate everyone and eveything and your not ashamed of it.     urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Whoo hoo.  Ok. I really need to finish packing now >  Arrivederci...Adiós...Vaarwel...Au revoir...Auf Wiedersehen...etc. ^_^

      Normally I hate shopping. But..today was fun. Mostly because all I got was books. heheh. I loves me some books ^_^  Most of them were for summer reading. Here's what I got:  Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare All Quiet on the Western Front by Remarque The Joy Luck Club by Tan The Iliad by Homer Les Miserables (with the little accent over the e) by Hugo The Arabian Nights  I also got Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, since I've been wanting that book for a while. I love Carroll's works. And he has my birthday, too =p Oh yeah..and I got The Inferno by Dante Alighieri because I've been wanting that for a while, also. The only other book that I really want now is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection by Darwin..heh. I'm going to wait 'till I can get a really good copy in hardback, though.  So. A summary of these books..  I've already read Much Ado About Nothing..it was really good. I like Shakespeare's works a lot, fortunately. My favorite poem (for the time being) is "The Seven Ages of Man", which he wrote. He always seems to have one character that is very witty. I like how Beatrice is the one that's endowed with much wit in this story. It's always good to have a strong female in a story. Especially one that's very good at making fun of people and mocking people that are in love, and love itself. Whoo!  hm..I didn't want All Quiet on the Western Front, but it was required. And I didn't want The Joy Luck Club..but my mom insisted I get that. I already know the story in The Iliad by heart..but I still needed to get an actual copy of the poem.   I've already seen the movie Les Miserables..it was interesting, I suppose. But..like The Iliad..it's something that I needed just so I can re-read it at times, and to have on hand.   Lastly..I just knew I had to get Arabian Nights because I love folk stories and fairy tales and..yeah. It's gonna be fun reading that. I'm thinking it'll accompany me to tennis camp next week. That way, I won't be troubled with stopping points, since it's just made up of many short stories.   Ohh yeah. I'm going to  urlLink tennis camp  next week.  It's my home-away-from-home. I went there the first year that it opened..the first week, actually. And I went there for two weeks last year. I'm going for two weeks again, this year. I leave on Sunday (June 6th), and I'll get back on Saturday (June 12th). I then leave on Monday for Journalism Camp at UNC Chapel Hill..and..I have no idea when I get back from that. I think it's for three days, but I'm not sure. I'm going there for the literary magazine info, not for journalism, though. Soo. I have no idea what that's going to be like.  Ok. This post is getting long. I need to finish my comic-listing, however..  6.  urlLink Applegeeks  7.  urlLink Queen of Wands  8.  urlLink Megatokyo  9.  urlLink Little Gamers  10.  urlLink Mac Hall   Two honorable mentions..:   urlLink What I Learned Today  This comic just isn't old enough to know if it's really a keeper, I guess. There are some hilarious ones, though.   urlLink InkTank  I just found out that this comic was up and running again. There are many many funny comics in InkTank's archives. I just haven't gotten the chance to look over the latest ones.  Ok. Time to actually..do stuff. Like clean up. "God forbid company comes over and sees our house in a mess"...company meaning Aaron, who could care less if our house was messy...and..the quote being a..mocking of how my Mother goes ballistic the day before people come over, because the house isn't *clean* enough. Oy.  Oh yes and..I have no idea whether to italicize the names of books or to underline them or to put them in quotation marks so..I'm just going to leave them plain like they are.

      Ok. My Mom got me into making dogbones a few years ago to get extra money. I have a booth at our local emporium and...well, it seems like I've been running low lately. So today I had to make some and I was going crazy. Instead of getting the kind of rye flour we normally have, my mother got some kind of natural...stone ground..whatever..rye flour. And every single freakin' time I tried to use the cookie-cutter to get a dogbone out of the mess...it would crumble apart.   So. I spent an hour..an  hour ..trying to make dogbones. Eventually, my mom went downstairs so I just got the dough together and threw it out in the trashcan. ^^;  I was so ticked off, though. When I was yelling at the dogbones and my mom finally came to see what the matter was, she automatically asked if I measured everything right and..oy. That just made me so angry. Of course I measured everything right. I'm not like my sister, who just guesses at all the measurements and does everything wrong when it comes to cooking. I try to be as precise as possible. I'm a perfectionist, after all.  Enough of that.  For some good news..my other sister is coming into town! Yay! Aaron's coming by on Friday, hopefully, and we can just talk and play games and do stupid stuff like sing along to that yellow submarine song by the Beatles. heh. Or maybe I could get him to let me on his AIM name so I can confuse his friends. Ah..good times...good times....  For some bad news...I'm going to try and pry myself away from RuneScape. Ok, that's not really bad news. But it's going to be hard for me. I finally got the picture after  somebody  sent me this  urlLink guilt-inducing slashdot article.   I think it's kind of funny, how this relationship is..I'm the gamer..and Jacob just isn't really a gamer. But...I've been thinking about it..it's a good thing that I'm not dating a gamer. I mean, I already have a hard enough time getting myself away from games. If I had a boyfriend who was a gamer..well..he'd just encourage the gaming and wouldn't help the addiction-to-games situation at all, I guess.   Oh well. I just know that I need to get away from RuneScape through my own strength of will. Jacob refuses to yell at me when I play RuneScape, unfortunately. I knew if I got him to "yell" at me, it would distract me from the game and I would be able to realize that I should talk to him instead of waste my life to a stupid, pointless game...  I'm also getting quite tired of being asking if I am actually a female on RuneScape. "omg asl?//"...the phrase is getting a little aggravating by now. Of course, there was the time that one person kept asking me to be their girlfriend and when I said no, because I already have a boyfriend.."o its ok, tho, u can have 2 bfs. i wont tell any1. it can b a secret" That made me laugh a lot.  Ah, and if you didn't know, I have a boyfriend. His name is Jacob. He's an oxymoron. ^_^  Oooh. Lunch. Ok. Food > blog. Yeah. Math. I hate math. But..that equation is appropriate...

      I can't get the song "Funky Town" out of my head. It's very hard to have that song in your head, considering there..aren't many words..and...ennnnh. Yeah.   I'm a little confused right now. Mainly about tennis and my geometry skills.    First..tennis.   I love playing tennis. It's a very complex, strategic sport. It's a sport I can actually connect with, really. You have to be a quick thinker, and also be fit and in shape. heh. I need to work on the being-in-shape part but...continuing.   I'm just angry because I can never seem to be completely serious. It seems like I enjoy the game too much. I laugh at my mistakes...I laugh when people out-think my moves and use my own tricks against me. I comment on good shots...and...well, I just like to have fun when I'm playing. I know that I should try and concentrate for when I play in tournaments but...most of the time I just don't think it's worth it, to be out for blood for a silly little game. Especially all these fanatic sports parents that push their kids to the edge and enter them in as many tournaments as humanly possible and make their children focus their lives on one sport...bah.   And..about geometry...hm. Apparently, I made a high score in a class I absolutely hate. It's not that I just hate the subject. Ooh no. I rather disliked the teacher, also.   So. It seems that I made a high score on the EOC...at one point, when I looked over my answer sheet..well, there are about six big columns with twenty questions in each or so. When I looked over it, I had one column almost completely blank because those were all questions I had skipped and were going to go back over. I panicked...and...gah. I hate math.  It's all..yes or no, wrong or right. You're just doing problems that have already been proven by so many other people over and over. What's the point of it? I just don't understand why they make us do math. And when am I going to use these skills in the "real world"..? I mean, by the time I ever come across a situation where I need to know how to calculate the length of an arc of a circle..you think I'm going to remember the formula?! Give me a break.  Ok. So. I feel like listing stuff. Oooh. How about my favorite webcomics. Sure! That works.  I'll list top ten favorites, first being..my favorite, obviously.  1.  urlLink Something Positive     I've just always loved this comic a lot. Maybe it's the sarcasm. Or the cynical-ish-ness. I dunno. It just always makes me laugh. ^_^  2.  urlLink Ctrl+Alt+Del     There's no need for me to write a reason why I like this comic. I mean..c'mon. It's CAD. Everyone loves this comic. Well, every gamer. Well..ok..I dunno. Just..a lot of people like it.  3.  urlLink Sinfest     Again..it's Sinfest. It makes fun of religion, love, cats and dogs..random stuff like that. It's good stuff.  4.  urlLink Real Life     This is just simple humor. Which...everyone needs just a bit of simple humor every now and then.   5.  urlLink Penny Arcade     The legendary Penny Arcade. One of the best. When a comic is funny, it's lmfao-funny. When it's not funny, you just kind of sit there and scratch your head. You have to know a bit about games to understand most of the inside jokes, unfortunately. But..they always seem to end their last panel with something completely irrelevant that makes everyone laugh. Well, normally. enh. Tycho's the best XD  Ok I don't feeling like continuing this now. I'll do it later. Maybe. Procrastinating is always nice. ^_^  Song for today: Funky Town by Lipps Inc.

      I have..nothing to do.  My Mother is going insane. Well, kind of. She's just going a little summer-crazy like I am. She made me a tinfoil hat. ^^;; She made one for Rose, too. Rose..did not like her tinfoil hat.  I had told her how I had tried to call Aaron yesterday at one point and intercepted someone's call. She then ranted for a while about all the stray microchips in the atmosphere that are out to get us and declared that, once we got home (we were in the car), that she was going to make everyone tinfoil hats. It's..very interesting to observe my mom when she gets into these moods.  hm. I played tennis this morning. I won my games..blah blah blah. Nothing to be very proud of. I wasn't playing against people close to my own level of skill 'n whatnot. It was fun, though, beating the annoying 'lil boys.   "You can't hit hard! You're just a girl!" I serve. "Whoa. DID YOU SEE THAT?! That was so cool! She went like *whoosh* and like wow."  I couldn't stop laughing whenever I played against them. it was hilarious ^^; silly boys.  Ok I'm gonna go..write..stuff. Yeah. enh. need something to do.  Quiz stuff..

      Whoo.  &nbsp;  So I had a tennis tournament yesterday, with two matches in one day.  &nbsp;  First match went by easily 6-3, 6-4. It was a very slow match, neither of us really exerting ourselves and just playing quite..leisurely, I guess. It was getting rather hot, anyway, which makes the best of people just kind of slow down and forget scores.  &nbsp;  But then, I had to play the #1 seed.  &nbsp;  Which..didn't really bother me. I've seen her in a lot of matches. And the last time we were at this tournament, she got out in the first round, then in the consolation round, too. I knew she'd outpower me, but I figured I'd at least try and give her a run.  &nbsp;  And I did. I did quite well, actually. My serve was going insane, but that's because my coach had told me the day before that I'd been doing it all wrong and I hadn't remembered I had a tourney, so..I didn't really practice fixing it. Oops. I managed, though. The score of the first set, 6-2, doesn't say how we went to deuce every single time.  &nbsp;  Anyway. It was easily around 80-85 degrees outside and it was just getting..really hot, to play tennis. We had to play on a clay court that hadn't been watered in a while, so dust was rising everywhere, especially after long points when we both had to run down the ball. Ooh I did really good, though, because a lot of the time she'd hit a very good angle but I would go diving after it, and she'd be caught off balance because she figured I wouldn't get it and..yeah. Anyway. I was running a lot.  &nbsp;  So during the beginning of the second set, she was up 2-1 and I was..just..losing it. Mentally. Well, I hadn't realized it yet, but there was one point where I just dropped my racquet after hitting a great serve and stared at it thinking "Oh hey, I dropped my racquet. That's pretty funny." and I hadn't really processed that yet when she hit it back...If I had been an onlooker, I would've laughed at myself so much. I just stood there kind of stupefied.  &nbsp;  That's when my Mom yelled at me to get off the court and sit in the shade for a while but I yelled back No and that she wasn't even supposed to be saying anything. My opponent was pretty confused, not sure whether to laugh and keep a straight face. I don't remember much of the tennis after that. I just knew I was pretty dizzy, I was kind of talking to myself, and playing..bizarre-ish-ly.  &nbsp;  Half of the time when I was serving, I had to toss the ball straight up towards the sun and I couldn't see. So then I had those little traces on my eyes..y'know..and I kept trying to blink so I could see. Which..didn't help much. And at that point, we were going to a 5th or 6th deuce on nearly every friggin' game so I was just desperately trying to get it over with. Which..oh man, it was awful. I would just toss the ball up and hope I hit it, and I was hitting some great serves. So I'd, say, get the first point, but then she'd hit a winner when it was add-in for me. And then I'd double fault, but then when it was add-out for me, she'd hit the return straight in the net. 'Twas horrible.  &nbsp;  Aaanyway. Afterwards my Mom got mad at me and said I was having some sort of..heat stroke thing..which I wasn't listening, of course. I just had to lie down because I felt like I was gonna be sick. oy.  &nbsp;  Somehow in the second set, I got another game, even though I was going crazy. lmao. I started laughing during some points. And then at the ends of others, when I hit a bad shot or something, I'd just start making up words and just..rant on stupid stuff under&nbsp;my breath. I don't think the person I was playing against heard me, sooo..um..that's good.  &nbsp;  Ok I'm gonna go do stuff now. Maybe go crazy again. I dunno.  &nbsp;  Song: Lemon by Katy Rose  (I like her song Overdrive too) ^_^  &nbsp;  Ooh..and a quiz thing.    urlLink     urlLink  Which Super Smash Brothers character are you?

      Sooo. Yeah. Stuff. Been..doin'..stuff. &nbsp; Ooh. The updater thing is all..different. This is funky. Yay. More options! Options are always a plus. &nbsp; I've been having one of those "leave-me-alone-I'm-writing" moods, lately. Yesterday I went and sat outside and just scribbled down some stuff..and today I went out for about an hour, and just got back in. I don't even know what I wrote down. I bet it was interesting, though. mhm. &nbsp; Lets see... &nbsp; I've been playin' some tennis lately, yup yup. Yesterday we had "team" practice and I was shocked when the *seniors* came out and graced the courts with their presence. Of course, they talked the entire time, then left without picking up any balls. But I had a nice time mingling with the freshman and turning them against the older players. Yay for me! &nbsp; I was really-super-extra-nice, too. I went and got a basket of tennis balls out for them, since I'm only of the special people that knows the combination to the tennis hut..thing..whoo. At first, there was just a senior there and two freshman hitting against each other so I had to hit with the senior...which...I was just kind of thinking "Ohhh..*unappropriate blog word here*" But then all the seniors arrived and some other freshmen, so I saw the opportunity to leave the seniors by themselves and..it was just&nbsp;a good thing. Because then I actually got to practice! Yay! We played Canadian doubles, me versus the number 1 of the middle-school team last year and another girl..and they made me run. It was a very good work out for me, and I had to practice aiming the ball, alternating 'n whatnot so I didn't hit to one person the whole time.  &nbsp; I think the girl who was #1 on the middle school team last year will be in the top 6..I want to see her in the top 6, at least. She's good. She won't take over, but she's still good. I'm hoping I'll be #1..but..I just need to practice more. I played horribly at "open courts" today with George (my coach) and..yeah, that was depressing. But it made me wake up and realize that if I don't get my ducks in a row, I'm gonna get beat during challenges, and that would totally suck. So! More practice time for Megan, now. Lately I've been going out and serving from 7-8 anyway. I'll just have to do that more,  along  with practices with the "team" (pft) and George.  &nbsp; Moving on.. &nbsp; I went and shadowed at the newspaper place yesterday. It was..kind of interesting, kind of boring. It would have been absolutely horrible if I hadn't shadowed the guy that I ended up shadowing. He knew what it was like to just watch a person do ads and that kind of stuff, so he tried to make it as interactive as possible, I think. I ended up doing one of those "Happy Birthday" announcements and..I won't be able to forget it. It was to someone named Gatlin..and..the person had listed the entire family in the announcement, which was bizarre..and come to find out, this Gatlin girl has a grandparent named Snook..and..I just lost it there. I couldn't stop laughing for a while..I mean, Snook. SNOOK! &nbsp; Anyway. I don't think I want to design ads for the rest of my life. It looks pretty boring. No way to really be creative, at least. But I'll keep an open mind. I mean, maybe my thing could be the magazine ads..or commercials. oh i love commercials. enh..It just seems like doing newspaper ads isn't that..thrilling.  &nbsp; In an hour or so I'm going back to shadow the same guy doing page layouts. I really don't know if I'm going to like that either, but..like I said..gotta keep an open mind. And this might be a nice opportunity to get a job next summer at the newspaper office. Who knows. &nbsp; I really think the literary magazine is gonna be my main project next year, and I'm really excited about it. Honestly. I'm not just saying it like OMG I CANT WAIT 2 DO TEH LITARARY ZINE! I mean...I think it's gonna be fun. I'll get to do page layouts in creative ways...pick what stories, poetry, and artwork goes in and what doesn't (bwahahaha)...be an  editor ...yay! &nbsp; To sum it all up..summer is getting boring. I'm ready to be back in school. Doing stuff.  &nbsp; Song: Let's Get It Started by the Black Eyed Peas

      So..yeah. I'm really really bored.  We went to Raleigh a few days ago...that was one of the worst little trips I've had to suffer through. First, we had to wait two hours whilst my Mom and some tire people tried to figure out what to do with the flat tire and if they should put on the spare tire or put on another tire and where to put it and..oy. So, that took two hours. Then we actually got on the road! And of course, it's about three hours or something from here to Raleigh..which was delayed..a lot..due to much road construction and a lot of traffic near Durham. So, the trip took about four hours. We then had to wait for an hour to get food from P.F. Changs..mm..it was worth, it though. And I got pants from the mall. Yaay. They're nice.  Ooh..and I got some really good cake from the Cheesecake Factory..yeaah. that was good. Of course, then I had to listen to my grandparents talk about their trip in Saskatchewan, Canada..eh.  On the way back, though, we stopped by Winston and I traded in my games and got SnowBoard Kids..yaaaay! ^_^ It was really really weird, though...once I got in the car, I called Aaron to tell him I had found the game and wouldn't have to get it off of Ebay, but then while his phone was ringing, I checked the back of it and it says "Aaron" in permanent marker. Ok..coincidences like that freak me out. We had a nice time laughing about it, though.  Lets see..  We have kittens (again) and so far we've only been calling them by their colors..like, "Hey look at the grey kitten" or "MOMMM...DAISY'S TRYING TO EAT THE WHITE-PAWED GREY KITTEN"..etc. My sister and I gave 'em names yesterday...so...we decided to kind-of-sort-of going with artists. The black and white one is Escher..my favorite, the grey one with white paws, is Toulouse Lautrec...and we couldn't think of a good female artist name for the grey kitten that's a girl, so it's Phoebe. heheh.   Ah..today I went by the newspaper office to ask about possibly shadowing someone and seeing how our local newspaper works. whee -_-; I had a nice time talking to the editor, though, and I'm going to go in on Thursday and Friday..one day to look at how they do page layouts, and one day to look at the ad designing. That's the stuff I like. I love advertising techniques. I can't help but watch commercials, captivated by trying to figure out how they try to get people to watch them. And I like analyzing ads in magazines 'n stuff to see how they're trying to sell their product. I think it's interesting. And I'm going to need to know the eye-catching design work to be able to pull of the literary magazine this year...so..it'll be good practice, if only that.  And..nothing else has been going on. Well, I've had a lot of fun making confetti out of all the republican mail we've been getting, but besides that..enh.   so much boredom.  Song: Hey Little Girl by Unwritten Law

      I have fallen in love with  urlLink Foamy   YOU HAVE TO GO SEE THAT SITE.  ^_^  Anyway.   That site is hilarious. If you ever saw Invader Zim, Foamy is like Gir..just as spastic..just as high-pitched...only with a very..dirty mouth, and twisted sense of humor ^_^ How could I not love it?  Sooo. Stuff that's been going on lately..  Aaron came over yesterday for the day..'twas fun. It's always fun when my seperated-from-birth-sibling comes over. Yay! It's also lossa fun talking to people his buddy list that I don't know. Finding out afterwards that I actually know some of the people..well..so far, it's only happened once. e.e; I didn't technically know the person..but..when checking our symphony's end-of-the-year-picture, we were right beside each other and..after finding that out, we still had no clue who the other was..and..that was just a really freaky coincidence. Moving on.  Oh. I've gotten off my AoM rush. After having a conversation like this at the end of a game, y'can kind of understand why..: My opponent: gg Me: (I had just forefeited) That was not a good game. It sucked. You rushed me before we were even five minutes into the game, and I had to make do with the few resources I had for an hour. My opponent: lol Me: (After games, I always seem to get hit on..so..) Don't you dare hit on me, either. I'm pissed off right now. My opponent: o, so u r a girl? how old r u? Me: AGGGGHHH  So..too much testosterone + too much stupidity = overwhelming of the Megan to the point where she can't enjoy her game of smiting people anymore.    Bleh. I don't like stupid people.  Let's see..  I've been pretty bored. Nothing's going on this week. My Mom's gone to meetings a lot, but we're probably going to go to Raleigh on Friday (which means P.F. Chang's for me...YAAAAAAY..I   I have been downloading music like crazy today out of pure boredom. I go to Smartpunk.com and find some bands I've never heard of that have interesting names..then download 'em. It's fun. heheh. I just have..very weird tastes in music.  enh. I feel like my summer is being wasted. I have a huge music theory book I should be going through, but I keep procrastinating. I should be practicing violin, but..again..procrastinating. I should be playing more tennis...I shouldn't be playing so many games...I should be working on ideas for the literary magazine...I should be doing  something!  But no..I just sit at the computer and watch flash videos or read bash quotes >  I've always had a very bad habit of forgetting journals and long-term projects. bleh.   Enough complaining. I'm gonna go play some games and scare people on Yahoo.  Song for today: Puttin' On The Ritz by...I have no idea. It's a really good song, but I found a version by the Taco and by They Might Be Giants and it's the same..so..somewhere, along the lines, this song got mislabeled..enh.

       urlLink  Ooh.   heheh: One academic came across: "please click here for more information" in the body of a student essay. Other students have forgotten to delete the: "thank you for buying your essay from ..." at the bottom of their work   urlLink  HAHAHHAHAAAA   lmao..  Serena follows law of the jungle  Fri Jul 2, 9:42 AM ET    By Bill Barclay   LONDON (Reuters) - Serena Williams graduated to the Eric Cantona school of sporting philosophy at Wimbledon this week.   "The lion is the king of the jungle, but the tiger is the king of the forest" -- that was the reply the defending champion gave when quizzed about her prospects for Saturday's final against Russian upstart Maria Sharapova.   The befuddling comment recalled the famous retort of French former Manchester United soccer player Cantona to reporters: "When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea."   Nonetheless it did take Serena a couple of attempts to get her philosophy right.   "I will prepare in a way that I will not tell you," she told reporters with a mischievous smile.   Asked why, she replied: "Because the lion is the king of the forest but the tiger is the king of the jungle."   Realising her error, the 22-year-old American hurriedly corrected herself.   "I had it mixed up the first time. The lion is the king of the jungle but the tiger is the king of the forest," she said.   Asked why she was not playing the doubles this year with sister Venus, who lost in the second round of the singles, Serena hared off on another tangent.   "I just had a deja vu, that's weird," she said.   "I dreamt that Venus lost at Wimbledon and somebody asked me why we didn't play doubles. Then I was playing this young girl in the final. Isn't that weird?   "I always have deja vus."

      Well, stupid IE, rather. I have to press refresh at least five times to get any page to load and it's just..getting on my nerves, for some odd reason -_-;  eh. I got my schedule today. I have a problem with it, though, so it'll most likely be changing..soon.  First semester: Civics and Economics Algebra 2 Computer Applications 1 Journalism 2  Second semester: Honors English 2 Chemistry Show Choir 2 AP Music Theory  The teacher they've signed me up to take algebra 2 with is the same one that I had for geometry that I absolutely hated and went to the guidance counselor about. Sooo..I'll hopefully be changing that soon. And while most of my teachers are listed beside my classes, I apparently have no teacher for Chemistry yet. heh. Kind of amusing to just see that blank spot where a teacher's name should be.   One thing I don't understand is that I have the same homeroom teacher I had last year, but I'm not taking her for any of my classes..uh. I mean, I had her last her for Honors English, but this year I don't have her as a teacher..yet she's listed on here as my homeroom teacher..maybe that was a mistake. I dunno.  Sooo.  I'm thinking about exchanging some games to get a new game..or maybe even  games ...just depends how much I can get for the ones that I don't want. I have a WTA (Women's Tennis Association) game that absolutely sucks and I've only played once...it's for ps2..lets see..I also have the Harvest Moon game for PS2 which was really bad..aaand I have the first Sims game for PS2, which was AWFUL o.x I was so incredibly disappointed by that game e.e  I looked through my N64 games to see if there were any I didn't want, but I like most of the ones I have so..will be keeping them. heheh. My N64 games vary..ranging from Diddy Kong Racing to Zelda 64 (which isn't even mine..I'm...*borrowing* it)...WaveRider 64...Super Smash Brothers (eee ^_^)..and..others. One of my favorites was Quest 64, but I never did get it. I did beat it, though. It had a very sucky ending.  I would  love  to be able to get the new final fantasy game for the comp with the money from my turned in games. I think it's down to $50 now, at some places. Buuuut..that game would suck my life away e.e; It'd be enjoyable, losing my life to that game, but still...bad. e.e;; bad.  Or I could get the Age of Mythology expansion pack..the Titans thing..but I'd also lose a large chunk of my life playing against people online with that. I mean, I've already wasted countless hours playing just plain old AoM online against people that can't speak my own language...  hm. I'm also trying to find the old N64 game SnowBoard Kids, with no luck. Aaron and I used to rent that game everytime he'd come over to my house, so I really want it just for the nostalgic factor, I guess. It was a good game, though e.e I've found it on Ebay a few times, but most of those are being shipped from the UK and I'm not going doing that, with huge shipping prices 'n whatnot.  Ok. I've rambled on and on..time to bring this post to a closing. Uh..bye ^^;  Song for today:  urlLink This is Not an Exit  by Saves the Day
