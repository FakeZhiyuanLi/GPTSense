       urlLink    Front of Bridesmaid's dresses  urlLink    Back of dress--we had them hemmed to this length  Well, the countdown is on! It's now Thursday, so only 2 days until Beth's a Mrs!  Pretty damn exciting :) It's going to be a beautiful wedding, I'm really looking forward to it.   So on today's agenda:  *give myself a pedicure (already underway--I've smoothed them with one of those monstrous file things, removed my previous nailpolish, and am now waiting for my cuticle cream to soak in before applying new polish) *pack up stuff for the weekend--since Beth's picking me up tomorrow morning and I won't be home until after the wedding Saturday night. So I'll need the usual toiletries and things, but no makeup, since we're getting it done at the salon Saturday morning *practice my speech.  I've gone through it a few times, and although it's not very long and not really sappy, I still can't get through it without my eyes welling up and my throat getting all tight. What is it about weddings?? *think of something to write in the wedding card that I haven't already said in my speech  And then I think I'm set. I'm not sure what Beth's up to tonight, but Cory and Matt are going to be out looking at naked ladies--Cory's bachelor party is tonight, and the fact that it's starting at 6:30 is a little scary.  More hours=more chances to make asses of themselves. So maybe if Beth's looking for something to do tonight, I'll go over for some last-minute girl time.  She may be busy though, I'm sure she has lots to do.    So tomorrow should be a busy day. Beth's picking me up in the morning, we go get the truffles and then back to her place to start stuffing truffle boxes.  We then leave her parents there to finish and head out to nail appointments starting at 1:00.  The rehearsal's at 3, dinner's at 6, and then after that we're going out for drinks at Chancey Smith's before heading to the Station Park for the night (oh, between the rehearsal and dinner, Beth and I head over to the dress shop, pick up all 5 dresses and take them to the hotel & check in).  Ya, it's pretty much planned out hour by hour.  It'll be busy, but that's alright. It's fun busy.  Well, I'm off to polish my toes and sing loudly to the Chicago Soundtrack, just because I can.   Happy Thursday :)   urlLink

      I got some pictures developed today, which is always a good time.  The best part is that I didn't really remember what was on the film--there were still pictures from Rome on it! I took a bunch of pictures of random places that Matt and I frequented on his 2 week sojourn over Christmas--like the restaurant we ate in a lot, and the Patisserie (Pastry/Gelato/Coffee shop) where we ate many cups of gelato and bought a 15Euro bag of cookies.  There were also two pictures of Matt & I's first date when I got home--we went to an Opening night at the Grand Theatre.  Then there are pictures from Beth's Stagette that we had on Friday. (I still have a whole other roll of those to develop)  Anyway, I went over to Matt's and scanned a few:   urlLink    Stagette Fun--Beth &amp; I ready to party it up There really aren't enough occasions that call for crowns, sceptors, and beauty-pageant sashes.  Honestly.   urlLink    La Pasticceria di Giuliani I'm not sure what I loved more--the cookies, the gelato, or Stephanie and I's pre-Christmas feast of cheap wine and Italian pastries from there.  mmm.... cannoli...    urlLink    Heading to the Theatre, 2 days after I got home from Europe Ahh...

       urlLink     Beth and Brad Sipila, August 31 2003   The last two days have been fantastic.&nbsp; Beth and Brad have vacation time and have been in London since last night.&nbsp; Yes, this is my best friend and I've seen her 2ce since her wedding. TWICE since last August.&nbsp; True, I was in Europe over the winter, but still. Her living in Schomberg and only having Mondays off and me not having a car really curbs the visiting.&nbsp; So, while she's been here we've spent some quality time.&nbsp; I was over at her parent's place for dinner both nights, last night&nbsp;the 3 of us&nbsp;watched a movie, today we went out to one and after dinner went up to visit Brad's friend Zeddy (whom I know from many a New Year's Party, visits to Kincardine, and of course, last summer's wedding extravaganza).&nbsp; It's been fabulous. I miss those guys. One of the best things about Beth & I's friendship is that things are never weird. No matter where we're at in our lives, things don't change.&nbsp; She was in Australia for a year--things were still cool.&nbsp; I buggered off to Europe--things are still cool.&nbsp; I guess when you've been friends for this long, there are no surprises.&nbsp; We know eachother so well that even if we go months without talking, we know things will still be cool.&nbsp;  It's a great friendship.&nbsp; We can sit on our arses watching her new bunny (who is so insanely cute) and not say anything and it's still fun.&nbsp; And Brad's fantastic too.&nbsp; He really is the male version of Beth, and I love it.&nbsp; So, the pith of this entry is that it sucks that I don't get to see them often, but I'm lucky to have a friendship like ours.&nbsp;   Anyway, that's all I really wanted to write.&nbsp; I should head to bed I guess. I think I'm doing groceries tomorrow, and I have to do something with my bedroom (sadly, I haven't even put my suitcase away. I've been home almost a week and I'm not working... yet I haven't gotten around to that somehow).&nbsp; So much to do before Friday night too!   Oh hey, one last thing. I guess I have a job at the A&P! The wife of the guy I know working there was talking to my mom, and she said that I have the job and that they'll get in touch with me!&nbsp; Hooray! Now, I don't know what kind of hours it will be or the pay or anything yet, but still.&nbsp; I'll have an income of some sort again. That'll be nice. I hope they call tomorrow.&nbsp;   Also on tap this week: Beth Kampf's Stagette is Friday night, which should be really fun. It'll be good for her to relax for a night. I know that undernieth that calm facade she's actually pretty stressed out about all the little things that pop up the week before a wedding.&nbsp; I still can't believe it's next Saturday!!   Then Saturday night I'm catering, starting at 2:30, so that's great.&nbsp; Should be a nice long night since I'm starting so early, which means cashola for Heather.&nbsp; Cha-ching.   Sunday... I don't know what yet.&nbsp; I'm sure there will be at least a million things that will come up.&nbsp;  Well, I'm off to sleep.&nbsp; I need my beauty rest.  HB

        urlLink     Ahhhh. I just got back from a week on the family farm(s) in Saskatchewan, and I can't begin to tell you how relaxed I am. Honestly, there's nothing quite like it out there. Everything moves at a slower pace than here, and everything just happens as it happens.&nbsp; For example: It seems that no matter when I want to go up to our cabin at the lake, the whole family is available for a BBQ that night. Honestly, It wouldn't matter if I told them 2:00 Tuesday afternoon or 10:00 Sunday night. They're there.&nbsp; I guess it makes sense though.&nbsp; After they've planted the crops and before they have to harvest them, what is there to do?&nbsp; You spray them every now and then, you check on them.&nbsp; This leaves a lot of time for helping someone with their busted tractor, having a few beers and visiting with the Ontario relation.&nbsp; Matt and I visited a ton of my family, and only once was someone not home or actually busy.&nbsp; Otherwise, they have all the time in the world.&nbsp; Two of my cousins drove home for the weekend to see me, one from Saskatoon (3 1/2 hours away) and one from Winnipeg (5 1/2).&nbsp; I felt pretty special.&nbsp; (Really though, I see them MAYBE once a year, so I guess it seemed like a justified trip for them)    Highlights of our trip:   i)Proving to Matt that without a doubt, my grandpa does make himself out to be more deaf than he really is.&nbsp; With his hearing aid in he still manages to 'not hear' my grandma, and yet he had an entire conversation from across the room with Matt, sans hearing aid, and had no problems :) I guess after 60 years with grandma he has it perfected.    ii) Hanging out with my Uncle Keith (dad's first cousin).&nbsp; What a laid-back guy.&nbsp; He's hilarious.&nbsp; And he laughs at everything for a really long time, even if it wasn't meant to be funny. Example: "I guess you should get another beer from the fridge Heather. heheheheheheheheh..." It's really low pitched and funny.    iii) Bonding with Aunt Pat (dad's brother's wife). I used to think she was really bitchy. Turns out that I have more in common with her than I do with anyone else, including my dad. We had a grand time picking apart the weird family dynamics out there.    iv) Being able to just take off when I want to. This is the first year that I've been there without my dad, and thus the first year that Grandma &amp; Grandpa gave me a car for the week. So we didn't have to ask if we could use the car to go into town or to the lake or to just cruise or whatever. It's weird being an adult. And great.&nbsp;    v) Having absolutely nothing that I have to do.&nbsp; A whole week of it. No phone calls to make, no emails to return, nothing I have to set an alarm for. It's heaven.&nbsp;    So ya, it was fun, in a way. Not fun like going down a waterslide or karaokeing or spraying Matt with a hose while washing his car.&nbsp; But fun like feeding ducks or watching a sunset while drinking a coffee.&nbsp; Laid back, quiet, relaxing, fun. Oh, and another cool thing: I found out that some random uncles of mine actually kept up to date with my Europe Blog while I was away. This is surprising, since I see these people at best once a year, so they never actually know what's going on in my life, except when I'm out visiting them. My uncle Ken (dad's cousin, Keith's brother) was asking specific questions about blog entries (which proves that he didn't just skim and he's not lying about keeping up to date with my travels to make me feel good), for example, about the creepy guy in the Naples hostel, and about my pretty pink Roman coat. I was duly impressed. Who knew the family cares? Shouldn't be that surprising I guess, but it is. &nbsp;  Now, back to reality.&nbsp; And the reality is that Beth's wedding is in 12 days and things are getting a bit hectic.&nbsp; I'm holding her Stagette on Friday, and then next week we have nail appointments, a rehearsal and dinner, a whack of truffles to box, final dress fittings and a wedding.&nbsp; Holy crap...Tomorrow I have a sort of job interview I guess.... It's for bakery at the Cherryhill A&amp;P, and I think I already have the job really. My mom's friend basically told me I have it, but I should go in tomorrow while he's working with a resume and he'll introduce me to the bakery manager, whom he's already spoken to. Excellent.And yay! Beth Sipila comes home tomorrow! I've seen my best friend once since I've been back from Europe, and really only 2ce since her wedding last Labour Day weekend.&nbsp; Crazyness.&nbsp; She's got a week off, and since she and Brad just spent the last few days in Kincardine with his parents, they're now coming to London for a few days.&nbsp; Yay! I miss that girl.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll get to see her tomorrow night, provided she doesn't already have something planned.&nbsp;  Well, I guess that's it for now.&nbsp; I'm going to give myself a much deserved pedicure.&nbsp; HB

      Well, it's my last day of work here at the University, so I thought, 'what better way to waste company time than to create a new journal?'So here I am.&nbsp; I've given up on my blog much for the same reasons that Cathy did.&nbsp; Too many people with the address, not enough privacy.&nbsp; And really, what I want in a journal is to be able to write what I want to write, not what others might want to read. Frankly, my life isn't that exciting right now. I don't have a whole lot of 'events' to write about--really, does anyone want to read about my day at work or cooking dinner with my boyfriend? Didn't think so. So I'm setting out to write a journal for me.&nbsp; I want to be able to write about what I'm thinking and feeling--the good and the bad, without having to censor anything.&nbsp; Welcome to Heather's Spot.  So ya, it's my last day of work at Western. As of 4:30 pm, I no longer have to look up mail (or pretend to) for 7&nbsp; hours a day in a windowless, grey cubicle. I'm free! Consequently though, I'm jobless. Well, sort of. I'm working for the catering company tomorrow night, so that's good. And my mom's friend seems to think that by the time I get back from Saskatchewan he'll have a job for me in the A&amp;P bakery, which would be great. Considering that I'm going back to school in September, it doesn't really make sense for me to look for my dream job, only to leave in September.&nbsp; So baking is right up my alley.&nbsp; The old stomping ground.&nbsp; Hopefully the hours will be a little flexible, since I already have a couple days I can't work due to Beth's wedding. I hope it's straight days--mornings would be ideal.&nbsp; Anyway, I think maybe I'll work for a little bit now, I'll probably be back later, since I really don't feel like doing anything today.&nbsp; Knowing that Matt's vacation has started now and he's hanging out at home makes me really REALLY not want to be here.&nbsp; Honestly, what kind of sadistic jerk would make my last day at work the Friday after a holiday Thursday? Why make me come back??&nbsp; It's not like I'm doing anything anyway... Heather's first post, signing off.  1:35 p.m. Yup, still wasting time.&nbsp; I've gone for lunch (took my time coming back) and I'm completely out of things to do.&nbsp; LET ME GO HOME!!&nbsp; I went to ask my boss if there was any sort of special task she'd like me to do, and she said the most dreaded of all activities: file. I don't think anyone but me understands the horridness of this chore.&nbsp; It's 2 walls full of shelves and files, and stacks upon stacks of random pieces of mail to put away. It bites. More than I can possibly explain.&nbsp; So, instead of doing that, I'm currently pretending to look up the 5 articles of mail that came in the 12:30 delivery, wondering how this can possibly tide me over until the 2:30 delivery when, in theory, I'll have something to do.&nbsp; I've already organized my cubicle, but I haven't taken my pictures down yet.&nbsp; I'll do that just before I leave.&nbsp; So really, I'm at a loss. Again, I DO NOT WANT TO FILE. Crap! I was just busted my soon-to-be ex-boss! Gotta go...

Keep in mind when picturing this beauty on me that I also get to wear a hairnet and far-too-big baseball cap with it.  I am such a catch.   Off to bed so I can be bright eyed and bushy tailed at work in the morning.

      Nothing particularly interesting to note today.  I went with Lisa to see the bridesmaid dress she's picked out--it's very pretty.  Black chiffon, floor length, with a chiffon sweep across the bust.  I think it'll look nice on everyone.   Otherwise, I haven't done a whole lot today.  Tomorrow I start my first shift in the bakery, and friday too. That should be good (once they get me a uniform that fits, that is).   I'm really looking forward to school.  Not because I've missed sitting in a classroom or writing essays though; I'm looking forward to 1) getting more letters behind my name 2) being qualified for a grown up job that doesn't require a hairnet 3) getting that grown up job and making some money 4) moving the hell out of my mom's house and actually considering myself an adult.  I'm so bored of this in-between... Anyway, I'm off.  I think my brother's coming over for a bit, so I'm going to go make a pot of coffee.

      I'm feeling numb, and I'm not sure why. I'm trying to work it out in my head, but so far, I can't seem to decide how I feel.  This could be a result of a couple of things ............................  (pardon me while I edit this part of my soul-searching out of this post. There were a few more paragraphs here, but I've 'second-thoughted' writing it here for all to read.)    Sometimes I'm just tired of thinking about it at all. Maybe that's why I'm feeling numb. Maybe there's just a point where my brain just wants some down time and no matter how I try to figure it all out I'll just come back to the same point.   I guess that what I said before is fine for now. If it's right, it's right. If not, we just have to move on, and we'll know when we know.  I guess. I hope.  Cause ever since I tried  Trying not to find Every little meaning in my life It's been fine  I've been cool With my new golden rule  Numb is the new deep Done with the old me And talk is the same cheap it's been  Numb is the new deep Done with the old me I'm over the analyzing  Tonight  Stop trying to figure it out (you try to figure, you try to figure it out) It will only bring you down  You go, John Mayer. night

       urlLink      I've just started reading a book that was lent to me by the ever-talented and lovely Catherine (which was lent to her by Dave & Amanda) and I'm pretty impressed so far.  It's pretty interesting. The subtitle is "A practical guide to helping men discover health, happiness and deeper personal relationships".  Now, I know what you're probably thinking. It's something along the lines of: Hey Heather, you're not a man. Why the hell are you reading a book for men?  The answer, my loyal reading public of 3, is simple.  It's bloody interesting. So far (and, owing to my insane weekend I'm only on page 35) it's provided quite a bit of insight on the bizarro inner workings of the male psyche and why they are how they are. I've never really been one for so-called "Self Help" books, but I nonetheless highly recommend this one to every man and every woman who knows a man.  So that's about everyone, I guess.   Well, I think I'll go hit the pillow and read a bit of it now. My body is still aching from work on Saturday--carrying all of those bloody wooden chairs from the beach to the tent has made my arms ridiculously sore. They feel like someone punched them repeatedly for about an hour.  Still though, I made $130 on Saturday, plus the $40 from Friday night, so It's worth it.  That, added to the $32 from orientation at A&P tonight should make my bank account a little happier with me. Not a bad weekend at all. Not condusive to socializing, but really, what the hell would I have been doing otherwise? Nada.  Exactly.

      I'm just enjoying my Cinnamon Toast Crunch this morning and thought I'd write a quick post before work.  Yes, that's right; I'm 24 years old and I still eat Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Wanna make something of it? It's my 'weekend cereal'.  Quit judging me. I still like cartoons too. Shut up.  I catered an event at the Brookside last night, which is always a new and exciting adventure. The people were so insanely rude! I've never see a group of people act that way ever in my life. There were hunks of chicken carcass (I hate that word, but it's grossness applies here) scattered on the tables, and rice seemingly ground into tablecloths.  I was in the kitchen, not serving, but apparently the guest were yelling and swearing at staff and insulting them for not clearing their tables quickly enough.  It was horrendous. I consider myself a pretty open, non-racist person, but I can't help but notice that at every 'Arab' wedding I've served I am treated terribly and the people seem to have no respect for the serving staff or their surroundings. I had  hoped it was just a few isolated experiences, but according to other staff, it seems to always be the same. It's a shame really. Group mentality run amok.   Anyway, today I'm off to Rondeau park for a tent wedding outside. I'm pretty flattered that I'm going, since Jim (one of the head server dudes, who often runs events) asked specifically for me to work with him today instead at any of the other 4 events we're catering. Good deal. I guess not being 17, and actually being there to do my job as opposed to flirting with other 17 year old staff pays off.  I like that I'm respected now.  Yay me.  Quick and not at all exhaustive update on the love scene: Matt called me yesterday. We had a pretty decent talk, and it boils down to both of us being terribly confused about the whole matter. We've decided that neither of us has been in a truly adult relationship before--one where both parties actually work through problems together as opposed to giving up and finding someone new. It's a new situation for both of us, and it's kind of scary and exciting at the same time.  Anyway, we're going to see eachother this weekend (either tonight, if I'm home early, or tomorrow) to talk. It's not over yet, I know that. I hope it'll never be over... There's just too much good in our relationship to let it just pass by.  I may have sounded like I was 'getting over him' but I was actually just lying to myself (and anyone reading this) :) Honestly, I never want to be over him. "Who knows where the road will lead us; only a fool would say..." I'll keep you all (the collective 3 of you who read this regularly;) posted.   For now, I'm off to pull my hair back and throw on the ol' tuxedo again. Good times all around. I love making money--I don't do that often enough.

       urlLink     Well, this morning I went to that interview for the A&P bakery finally, and good news, I have ANOTHER weekend job. I'm not sure how this will work with catering, but I'll find a way.  The store manager said that many of the shifts are morning, so that would be fine, and they know I have another job so I'll get my schedule early.  It only pays $8 and hour--actually, it starts at $7.50, but considering my past experience he said he's working on getting me $8.  So that's alright.  It'll be good for the school year. And I'll be primarily cake decorating, which makes me happy.  Nothing like getting paid to do a hobby. He's hoping he can get someone in on Sunday to give me orientation, and then I'll start training next week.   So slap an apron on me, and call me sort of more employed.   I'm off to iron my tuxedo shirt so i can work tonight.  And tomorrow.  Ciao

       urlLink    It's amazing how realizing your own psychosis can give you perspective on life in general. After yesterday's episode of shame, I promptly set about kicking myself in the ass for being 'that girl'.  Again, as cliche as it sounds, "I Will Survive" is surprisingly uplifting.  So after listening to that on repeat for about an hour while doing a ceremonial cleaning/purging of my room, I felt a million times better.  Also recommended: telling a couple of friends about what an ass I made of myself.  After saying it out loud a couple of times it is next to impossible to justify psychotic outbursts.  (Ha, I just looked up 'psychosis' in the dictionary just for kicks: "A severe mental disorder, with or without organic damage, characterized by derangement of personality and loss of contact with reality and causing deterioration of normal social functioning." Sounds about right)  Last night I got a phone call out of the blue from a very old friend from highschool, and thought "what the hell, let's get together".  I really don't keep in touch with people like I should. We had a great night, just talking and reminiscing. A lot of self-discovery occurred--it was like sitting myself as I know me today next to the old me of back then, and doing a mental inventory of what I like and dislike of both Heathers.  I've come out of it realizing that truly, I am such a catch. I deserve someone who appreciates me more than I do even. I deserve to be loved like I obviously haven't been loved, and no amount of whining and moping can reconcile what I deserve and what he could give. If one person isn't 110% about a relationship, then it wasn't meant to be. To quote a great Sinatra tune: "When somebody loves you it's no good unless he/she loves you All the Way".  Truer words have never been spoken (or sang). Of course I'm still sad, but I'm not going to let myself settle for something less than amazing.  In the words of Bridget Jones, "I'm still waiting for something more fantastic than that"  More than anything, I don't ever want to end up like his parents, who are married in name only but have no real use for eachother anymore. That's not my gig. I deserve the kind of love that will last a lifetime and still be fresh, and I'm now realizing that maybe Matt and I's love just couldn't be that type.  No matter how I try to make it.  "Some plants are only meant to last for a certain season or a certain time. If you try to make them live longer, you will be a bad gardener" (from "How to be Happy, dammit" by K. Salmansohn)   I, and everyone else for that matter, deserve love that won't fade after 5, 10, 50 years. When I'm 65 I want to still look forward to seeing my guy, to still get butterflies--and I want him to feel the same. I want to be told that I look beautiful out of the blue. I want someone to caress my hand just because it's there.  I want a love that doesn't fade when he's overtired or has seen me a lot that week. I want LOVE. I don't think that's too much to ask, and I know it is attainable. I've seen people who've found it, and I know that when it's right, it's right. And when it's wrong, you just have to suck it up, forget about the plans you've made as a couple and focus on plans for yourself alone, and be independently fabulous.    Things happen for a reason. People walk in and out of your life to teach you things when you need to be taught, and you can't resent them from leaving when the lesson has been learned. If he's truly walked out of my life, I have to know that it's the right decision for both of us.  Both of us can take something special from this relationship, and I don't regret a thing. I have loved him deeper than I ever thought I could love someone, and if nothing else, I've learned how deeply one can feel.  That's a very valid and necessary lesson.   I, finally, am ok. I'm more than ok. It feels wonderful to have my old, optimistic self back.    "Growth can come from places you thought were dead, barren, and disappointing. You always have a choice of emotional responses to life. Happiness is not about what happens to you, but how you choose to respond to what happens." (Salmansohn)

      Oh My God, I've turned into HIM. I've turned into my ex-boyfriend--the needy, can't-stop-calling, can't-get-it-through-his-head-that-it's-over crazy ex.  When did this happen?  This afternoon. Well, I guess it started yesterday. I sent Matt an MSN message yesterday asking if he was free one night this week b/c I hate how we left things and I'd like to talk. He sent one back saying he'd let me know, but that work is crazy this week for him.  It's bad enough that I messaged him at all, but could I leave it at that? NO!!  Today I messaged him, and he didn't write back.  Then, I messaged again later. He said that he had been away from his desk all day, and still doesn't know about getting together. I, being pissed off (and certifyably crazy), write back "If you want to just say 'no', then do it" to which replied that he'll really be working late, and doesn't know. Actually, he told me that his boss is sick (has been for a while) and he was leaving to drive him home, and that he really will be working late every night this week, and that he doesn't have time for this right now. He said he'd try to MSN me tomorrow. I'm so embarrassed. I can't believe I did that.  I'm Crazy. I hate it, and I can't believe I've become this person.  Where is the "oh well, whatever, I'm fabulous" Heather that I used to be? She's been replaced with this mopey, pathetic girl who lives in her bathrobe feeling sick to her stomach all day.    So, resolution: no matter how much I want to, no matter how bad I feel, I WILL NOT CALL OR EMAIL OR MESSAGE HIM.  Nothing good can come of it.  If he was even thinking a little that the breakup was a mistake, he certainly isn't now.  And besides that, it's really not healthy for me.  It's not healthy for me to be hoping for things to turn around with this. I need to accept that it's over and move on.... how the hell do I begin to do that? The only other time I was broken up with was when I was 19, and I got over it by going out with someone else (I call it Serial-Dating).  I really don't feel like dating anyone else this time.   I remember when I broke up with Dave and he just wouldn't let it go, and I hated him for it.  I pitied and hated him.  I really don't want to be that person. I don't want Matt to hate me, and I certainly don't want him to pity me.  He's been my best friend for so long that the thought of him thinking badly of me rips me up inside. I'd give anything to be even half of the independence-addicted Heather that I once was--the Heather who would be ecstatic to be single again, and who could come up with a zillion reasons why I could do better than him.    How the hell do I get back to that?  I hurt so bad. I'm going to listen to Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" on repeat. Cliche? Perhaps, but whatever. In the face of adversity, stick with the tried and true.  Gloria Gaynor and ice cream.

      I don't even know where to start with this post. I guess I'll give a quick update on Beth's wedding first. It was beautiful. I've never seen a more elegant wedding--and I've been to a lot of 'em. It looked like it was straight out of a wedding magazine.  Beth and Cory were both extremely happy with how it all turned out, and they're now happily married and on their honeymoon :)  So Congratulations to the Legues!  (for anyone counting, that's the second friend of mine named Beth who's been married in the past year. also, the second wedding I've been the maid of honour in)   urlLink    Beth & Cory Legue  They're not back until the 10th, and man, do I ever miss talking to Beth.  It was pretty much a daily thing--if we didn't talk, we'd email or IM.  I need her more than ever right now--she always knows the right thing to say somehow.  On Monday night, after honestly the best weekend I've had in recent memory, the shittiest thing happened. Matt and I, somehow, wound up breaking up. I can't even wrap my head around it, it's so bizarre.  Seriously, the weekend was wonderful. I couldn't have asked for a better time, a more considerate boyfriend, to be more in love with him than I was right then.  And then somehow... I honestly don't know what the hell happened.  It's unbelievable. How can something so wonderful end just like that? We've been seriously talking about our future together, and houses and stuff.... but I guess it was all for naught.  Now, for anyone keeping track, yes, we did break up once before--sometime in June, for one week.  But I honestly thought we had resolved those issues, and our relationship (in my eyes only, I guess) has been fantastic ever since.    Obviously, this is not my choice. I know Matt has some very real things to work out, but I can't understand why we can't work them out together.  I can't understand how he could have been honest about a future with me one minute, and the next minute be seriously questioning if I'm right for him.    I personally have never felt more sure about anyone before. I've never been this in love. Christ, I lived with someone that I wasn't this sure about.  If Matt's not 'the one' for me, then frankly, I just don't know what to do with myself.  These feelings can't be for nothing.  I don't want anyone but him. I wish I could just tell myself that 'the next one will be even better'--which used to be my relationship mantra--but now I really don't know.   I'm trying to remember the end of my other serious relationships to compare how I felt then with how I feel now.  What I've come up with is that this is the first time I've been at the end of a relationship where I'm not just ready to go out and meet someone new.  The most recent one in 3rd year was the easiest, even though I had been with him 1 1/2 years and lived with him for a while. I knew he wasn't right for me and was really happy with my decision to move home. No regrets, no questioning myself. I knew. The one before that was so on & off that I knew it couldn't possibly be the love of my life--we had a good time, but that was it.  In the breakup before that I was pretty upset, but even still I knew that it was the right thing to do and didn't look back.   This one doesn't make sense to me.  No matter how I look at it,  I can't see that it's right for either of us. Honestly, I understand that he has some serious questions and needs to work through them, but I still can't see that this is the answer.  How can something feel so right, but not be? Is it just some sort of sick joke that my emotions decided to play on me?? I am truly at a loss. If anyone has any stellar advice to give me on how to understand this, I'd appreciate it. Obviously, I'm not very good at it. For now, I'm going to do some laundry.  Laundry always makes sense.
