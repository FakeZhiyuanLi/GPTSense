       hold your horses!  it's thursday, i had to go visit ABC after work so i don't get home till later.  then i had to get together rent checks and bank and 401k statements... yeah, i got pre-approved this morning for the loan and the sellers accepted my offer!!  pray everything goes well @ the bank tomorrow RRM emailed me today.  i guess EAB called her to tell her i've been going through a lot of shit & w/ her quitting & all she wanted to make sure someone was there for me or something.  she's so sweet. so ABC is gonna write this letter to D for me kinda saying how i feel but i don't think i'm gonna let her send it.  i'm too scared...

       so i put an offer down on a house today.  damn, and i thought shopping for the house was bad?!  just putting in an offer takes hours.  my agent called the selling agent tonite and she had just gotten another offer as well so she was going to try to present both of them to the seller tonite.  of course i have no clue what the other offer was.  i ended up being pre-approved for $3000 more than i thought and i can put down $1000 for closing so i got closer to asking price than i thought i would be able to.  average in that area is to sell at or slightly above asking price.  keep your fingers crossed.  i should know tonite or tomorrow.  the house is great but i'm not gonna go into it now.  not till i know cuz if i can't get it then it won't matter... elizabeth quit today.  i need her at work.  not a day goes by that i don't talk to her.  i can go to her w/ anything.  it's just one thing after another.  even ABC was saying today that i really have gone through a lot of big shit in a short period of time.  at least i don't feel like such a baby now.  sometimes it's hard to handle.  one at a time i could take. keep your fingers crossed for the house!!!!

       D is seeing someone.  He told me about it today.  I guess they've been seeing each other for a bit now.  I kinda figured something was up.  I made a comment about him going out every night lately when he told me he was on his way out and he said he was going to a "chick's" house.  He doesn't call girls chicks, he calls them broads.  I was like, some chick, huh?  Then he told me and I acted all cool like we were friends and he was telling me.  Said he was kinda freaked cuz she doesn't know he's married.  She's a Marine too.  God, how did I get myself in this situation?  I should've known my heart would end up crushed.  Somebody help me.  Why am I so unloveable?  Am I that ugly?  Am I that horrible?  What is wrong w/ me??!!

       ok, i'm home.  was glad to see family but made promises to STOP seeing them only on bad terms.  i think becca & family are coming here in a couple weeks.  i'm excited.  i had a good time, but the funeral was very difficult (of course).  andrea was a mess.  i felt so bad.  i never know what to say @ those things and of course all i could do is ball my eyes out & say i'm sorry.  becca & i had some deep god coversation too.  i got a lot of thinking to do. i was going to go to work tonite, but i'm too tired.  i'll just work a long shift tomorrow.  i'm too tired to write anymore right now.  it's definitely been a stressful week.

       i don't know why, this song just makes me think of D... ABC decided she was going to write a letter to him since she has all this time on her hands.  i said that's fine but i'm not giving her his addy cuz i don't trust her.  she said fine, she'll mail it to me to proof read.  lol.  i can't wait to see this one.  oh, the mailman should have been here by now.  i should have a letter from her today...

       i have no thoughts today. i have no money either  which is posing quite a problem.  D was gonna try to get me the money but the bar was dead tonite.  he said hopefully tonite.  that means i just need to get enough to get me there.  i have 1/2 tank gas already... oh, i am so fucked.  i don't know what to do. that fucking squirell is STILL in my attic.  nothing will kill that fucker!

       today was just long and miserable.  i got to work late and left early.  i still got close to 8 hours in at least.  hopefully i'll be able to get some work done.  i came home and was asleep by 6:30.  got up around 9 but i'm already tired again so i'm off to bed. nothing exciting happened today.  i just realized that i wasn't ready for this.  i mean, you can never really be ready, but  i really wasn't ready for it this soon.  i was expecting august or something.  i was really hoping to maybe go up there again while she was alive.  i need to make a point of visiting MI more.  just because my mom is gone doesn't make them any less my family. goodnight

       D just called.  he was so sweet when i told him what was going on.  i mean, he knew what was going on but none of us thought it would happen so soon so he was just as surprised as i was.  he said he has no $ right now but said he'll get me what i need to get there.  it doesn't seem like much, but that means a lot to me.  it takes a good friend to give a shit.  at least enough to go out of his way to put $ in our account for this... i had no business doubting him or badmouthing him b4.  i've just been over-emotional w/ everything that is going on.  i need to go to bed.

       Auntie Anne passed away this morning.  It's funny,I always check my messages as soon as I get home and I didn't today for some odd reason.  I came home and ate and ABC called and I talked to her and apologized for not going to see her,  then I hung up the phone and realized it said messages waiting.  I looked through the caller ID and saw my grandmother had called.  My heart dropped.  Auntie Anne passed around 10am.  All day long I was freaking out trying to get her addy cuz I had this card I got for her telling her I was thinking about her and how much I love her and loved seeing her again and Becca finally got the addy for me and the card went in the mail TODAY.  She was already dead when I mailed it.  My poor cousin will get it.  And my aunt will never know what she really meant to me.  I want to believe in heaven so bad.  Mom, show auntie the ropes.  I love you both... I don't know how I'm gonna afford this trip to MI.  I gotta see if D will help.   I need to stop crying now.  I bought cigarettes.  I don't even fucking care.  I just need them for today...

       if it can go wrong, it's going wrong today.  i'm not gonna get into it all.  at least D and i are on better terms.  i gave J gmail acct and we've been emailing back & forth to fool w/ things.  it's pretty cool.  i definitely like the "conversation" feature.  i feel bad cuz i didn't even go see ABC tonite and she only has 2  visitations a week but i was in such a bad mood i figured i had no right going in there like that and bringing her down too.  i like to go in there and laugh and have a good time and make her and AEC smile.  they both need to and they both deserve it.  they are good friends. i'm in one of those moods where i'm frustrated w/ my job again for no apparent reason.  oh well, i usually get over that.  but i'm miserable too.  constantly and i don't know why and i can't go through w/ this again and i can't handle losing all these family memebers and my brothers going overseas.  this is so overwhelming.  sometimes it's hard to hang on.  my family has always been my everything, my life.  what do i do??!!

       why would he tell me he wants me to come down there then suddenly stop replying to my emails and not call back?  i'm so fucking frustrated.  ugh.  now i'm glad i didn't listen to ABC and write that letter.  D doesn't deserve to know how i feel. my fucking refrigerator is broken again.  maybe this time my landlord will figure out that he should invest in a fucking new one and maybe they will stop breaking all the time!!  sometimes he's just dumb, i swear. there is this cute guy we just hired in our department.  i don't know if he knows i'm married or not though.  he was definitely flirting w/ me today but then he was looking @ pics on my desk and of course i have pics of me and D there so he's gotta assume i've got a b/friend.  wait, who am i to assume he doesn't have a g/friend anyway?  i don't know how old he is but he's graduated college, so close to my age @ least, if not older.  it's tough that i am above him technically, but i'm not his supervisor.  i wonder if that's against the rules?  very touchy territory there, but it could be fun.  oh, who am i kidding, i don't have the guts anyway and there are so many good looking girls in my department, there's no way he would go for me.  i don't know why i'm writing about this.  i think i'm just looking for someone to get my mind off of dave.  oh yeah, there's this wicked hot guy in verifications too.  nice eyes, built, very nice.  too short though (isn't that always the way?!) my landlords phone needs to stop being busy.  i'm fucking tired.  i'm going to bed

       I'm falling again will you help me up? So lost So scared So tired and confused Worked so hard to make it this far Now it feels like I could lose it all My childhood dreams long ago smashed to pices now I'm struggling to meet what I thought was second best I think back on my younger days try to find where it went wrong Maybe then I could pick up the pieces- move on Each day that passes everywhere I turn someone's hurting me lying to me is this really what I deserve? When it happens this much- well, there must be something wrong with me. If I could just figure it out if I could just see I'll never understand why you'd all do me like that all the same way- then go treat them like gold. I give up, I'm done I can't take anymore All I ever wanted was to love and be loved I'm not asking for more. Please don't lie or disrespect. Don't use me like that. I'm not a toy to be used to make her jealous or mad. Please remember I'm a person I have feelings too. Though I may act all tough I can still get hurt. And no, I won't take you back so you can do it to me again I can't handle anymore I'm falling, falling Can you please help me up?

       Ronald Reagan died today, 93.  I know, you probably don't care, but he's the first president I remember.  It's just wierd.  Death scares me too much. And on that note, did I mention that Joey is in Afghanistan?  He went a few weeks ago.  And he's going to be a dad!  He found out 2 days before he left.  I just feel so bad that he won't even meet his baby until (s)he is around 5 or 6 month old!  Poor Nicole having to go through that alone.  My brother Kevin has been told he'll be going to Iraq.  He doesn't have a definite date yet.  Alysa has decided not to move to TX w/ him.  I'm not sure if they are getting separated or what.  My brother's very upset so I'm leaving the subject alone for now.  OK, I really think I'm done w/ updates today.  :-)

       Have I mentioned Amy had her baby?  Gage Dylan, born June 2 @ 4:05am.  He is the cutest thing, of course.  She doesn't make ugle babies.  Lol.   So, it's funny, I haven't heard from him since he broke up w/ his girlfriend.  Still.  I mean, I'll see him @ shows and stuff and we talk then (and I'm making a point of waiting for him to talk to me) but he never calls anymore and I did call him one night after the show cuz he made it seem like he wanted me to come over (I had to drive people home first) and he never even called back.     So much for even being "friends".  I don't know if it's because of how popular they've become and he's suddenly realized that he can get pretty much anybody but I'm not sure why that should affect our friendship.  I've come to the conclusion that I will never get anything guys do. I really do love my husband though.  (omg, did I really just use the "L" word?!)  I know he loves me, I just don't think it's the same way I feel about him.  Isn't that how it always is??  Things are so different since we first decided to do this whole marriage thing and I want to say something to him but I'm so scared that if I do I'll lose him.  I don't know why I think that.  We've been friend for, like, ever.  I don't think he'd give up our friendship but it would definitely make things wierd.  And what if we really did try a relationship?  Then we're putting our whole friendship @ risk.  But then again, what really makes what we have NOT a relationship, ya know?  Other than not really discussing it.  I can't see us ever becoming enemies but strange things can happen when you step over that line.  Could we make it?  Does anybody have any ideas?    Not many people even have this url so I don't have my same following for help.  I guess I'll just have to continue feeling this for now and keep my mouth shut...  BTW, if you just stumbled upon this, my previous blog is s469.blogspot.com.  This is a continuation

       i just thought he'd make a good fuck friend.  i haven't really had one since MA, and we were "together" for, like, 2 years.  that's the beauty when you find a really good fuck friend.  neither one of you gets emotionally involved.  it's completely phsysical and sometimes it's just better to know i'm wanted.  oh, and the sex was great.  i miss that.  not him, the situation.  i'm not looking for a relationship (except w/ you know who, who will never love me back.) and then i wonder, y doesn't he love me back.  i mean, i know he's attracted to me and we get along great and we always have something to talk about.  i guess i know what it's like to not have it there though.  it never works for me...

       i talked to D tonite.  i know he got that letter cuz he asked if i gave his address to anyone.  i said no.  it's not a lie.  i wish i didn't know anything about it at all.  i mentioned something about ABC @ 1 point in the conversation and he asked if she was out yet so i told him what was going on.  i don't think he would have been interested otherwise.  anyway, he wouldn't tell me why he wanted to know if i gave his address to anyone and i was just like, whatever.  at least he acted normal.  we had a conversation like we always would, always have.  so i know he doesn't feel the same for me, but i knew that b4.  i wish it hadn't been pushed.  i feel worse now.  i'd rather not know.  he's still coming up here to help me move.  said he already took the time off work.  actually remembered the dates and everything so i know he really did it. i really give up.  there was Crai, Scott and D.  i'm done.  love is not real.  i guess i'll just die an old maid.  it's ok.  i always figured anyway. oh, my heart hurts.  i didn't think i could still hurt like this.

       i've dealt w/ my ghosts and i've faced all my demons.  finally content w/ a past i regret.  i've found you find strength in your moments of weakness.  for once i'm at peace w/ myself.  i've been burdened w/ blame, trapped in the past for too long.  i'm movin on.  i've lived in this place and i know all the faces.  each one is different but they're always the same.  they mean me no harm but it's time that i face it; they'll never allow me to change.  but i never dreamed home would end up where i don't belong.  i'm movin on.  i'm movin on and at last i can see life has been patiently waiting for me and i know there's no guarentees but i'm not alone.  there comes a time in everyone's life when all you can see are the years passing by and i have made up my mind that those days are gone.  i sold what i could and packed what i couldn't.  stopped to fill up on my way out of town.  i've loved like i should but live like i shouldn't.  i had to lose everything to find out.  maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road.  i'm movin on.  i'm movin on.  i'm movin on.

       may i point out that you guys are saying things like "you deserve better" "you deserve to be happy".  have you guys ever considered that i never wanted a relationship w/ him?  all i ever wanted was a friendship.  sure, other things have happened and i'm not going to say i didn't like it but if it never happened again it would be ok.  honestly, we wouldn't work in a relationship and we both know it.  our personalities just don't click that way, it's completely physical but platonic.  does that make sense?  when it comes down to it all, i'm still in love w/ D.  JR, how long ago did i admit that to you?  (but how many years did it take me to admit it?!  lol)  anyway, the point is, boy was not someone i was looking to settle down w/.  we want different things and that's fine.  the situation is that SOMEONE said something.  all i want to know is who, or at least why.  honestly, i rack my brain and can't think of who would know all of us to be able to put everything together. as for the other situation you guys mentioned, that was different.  that was a guy admitting to his girl that he kissed me and she emailed me about it.  that's 100% different and he told me everything he said. i'm not trying to defend the guys in either situation.  i don't know for sure who said what to who and i never will.  i guess i really just want to know why people want to hurt me so bad.  i try so hard not to hurt others.  BTW, fuck it.  i put my links back up on my yahoo profile.  everyone knows now anyway.  why do i need to hide?

       6 years today and it still hurts just as much as it did that day.  i'm not sure who said time heals all wounds or that it even gets better w/ time, but they obviously either never went through the devastation of losing a parent or just had no feelings.  i still go to call her when something good happens and my heart drops when i remember i can't. i love you Mommy.  i will always love you and always miss you.  i hope someday we will be together again.  it's what i have to hold on to.

       i'm at work so i don't have time to respond to all these comments right now but i do have to say something.  you guys are assuming this is about certain people but you don't know.  if you do know who i'm talking about, then you were obviously involved in what happened.  what made you come to the conclusion that it is this certain boy and girl i'm talking about?  there's never been a situation like this before.  i know what you're comparing this to.  if you are involved in the situation you will know if that's true or not.  i'd really like to know who this other person posting is.  you seem to know a bit about my life.  i do agree that girl doesn't need to contact me and that she would want to stay out of it.  i don't blame her.  if what i was told is correct, then all she is guilty of is telling guy what she was told and that's no crime.   back to work.  more later

       lol.  thank you for that interesting insight on my situation.  i suppose i never thought of it that way.  i guess i didn't realize that my life was so interesting that a person would go to such lengths to be involved in it.  still no excuse for hurting anyone though.  as for contacting the other person hurt in this situation, i don't know how.  all i know is her first name and that we have a common friend (or apparently ex-friend as the situation now seems to be.)  that's the worst part about it.  i couldn't have done anything even if i wanted to!  i wouldn't even know where to begin!  maybe it would help to talk, maybe it wouldn't.  guess i'll never know.  but hey, whoever is responsible for this, if you want to be involved in this soap opera so bad let it be known.  i'm sure we could find a role for you... i'm off to bed.  i've had a migraine all day books bought today- she's come undone, first person plural:my life as a multiple, i know why the caged birds sing, i know this much is true.  the first 2 are incredible reads.  read them a couple times already.  the last 2 come highly recommended. traded a gmail acct for the lovely bones.  yet another good book. read last weekend-sam's letters to jennifer by james patterson.  easy reading.  a good summer book.

       in response to last comment (i'm assuming it's from JR and she's just too lazy to sign in): it doesn't matter if it's "just some hoe" reading my blog because whoever this person is emailed somebody else to go read it, thinking they knew what i was talking about.  this person got hurt by it and also called the person something was supposedly about who in turn got mad at me thinking i was saying shit & that i emailed her.  meanwhile, i don't even have her email addy.  the point is, nobody on here really knows what i'm talking about.  damn, i tell AEC everything and if she reads it she gets confused on some shit cuz i'm so vague.  and on the other shit, when i actually use initials, you still have to know me.  point: someone is out there to hurt me or hurt her (or him?) and i can't even figure out who would know all of us to start this drama.  and he said he didn't know who sent the email.  @ first he thought it was me!!!  now why the fuck would i do that?

       need to sleep.  i fucked up my sleep so bad this weekend.  ugh.  work will suck tomorrow.  and i have to train someone too.  i wish i could crawl into a hole and never come out.  i wish i just didn't have feelings.  i feel like there's so much to say, so much swimming in my head, but i can't get it out.  i had to move all my fucking links to make sure ppl can't get here.  i hope i don't have to start a whole new blog.  it means a lot to me to be able to write here and for someone to be so mean and hateful.  i just don't understand how people can be like that.  how can you not care about someone else's feelings.  why would you do that?  and i'm not even talking about to me.  but to tell her to read something that you think has something to do w/ a situation you know nothing about?  that's cruel.  my mind just can't comprehend.  i never had this shit back home.  people weren't this petty.  they weren't so desperate for gossip that they did anything and everything to try to ruin other people's lives.  i'm sorry that you feel so bad about yourself that you feel the need to bring others down with you.  i hope you find a better way to release your anger rather than try to hurt others.  BTW, i don't know who you are, but why even make the assumption you did?  there are no names!  who are you to even think that?  do you think there is noone else in my life?!  if you paid enough attention you'd realize that i talk about a lot of different people.  stop assuming it's all  the same.

       so apparently someone out there is out to make my life miserable and thinks they know what they're talking about.  y are you trying to cause drama?  why are you saying something when you know nothing?  you don't fucking email someone like that, talking shit.  y would you want to hurt them like that?  which one of us do you hate that much?  i have no fucking clue who it could even be.  no one knows the identity of most of the people i talk about on here.  if i don't say a name it's for a reason and i purposely leave out details that gives stuff away so you have no right assuming.  it could be about anyone.  i have this here to get things out when i need to  and because i know it helps people.  i keep it going because of the emails i got when i was going to end it.  i don't understand why u hate me so much.  i hate no one.  i don't need this in my life.  please leave me alone. so i was so pissed off i threw my phone and went in the house and Akela brought it in cuz it was ringing... D finally called and i missed it.  go figure.  so i had to call and leave another msg.  must be on the way to princess' house.  there's no reception there. can someone shoot me? took the girls and christian swimming today @ little christians bday party.  we had so much fun.  i taught akela how to swim.  she did awesome.  JRJ came w/ me.  of course the day way going too good...

       it's saturday night and i'm sitting in my house alone, drinking.  don't get me wrong, i definitely had things i could do tonite.  and i refused to answer my phone a few times.  almost finished a book.  then i got to the computer for a minute and the next thing you know... haha, poor ABC, i just wrote her an 11 page (typed) letter.  a lot of it was blog entries she's missed so she knows a lot of it, but some of it i can't say out loud so i had to put it all together.  i'm not sure i made sense.  that's ok.  worse comes to worse, i'll just lose another friend.  i seem to be good @ that lately.  and then my friends back home call and ask when i'm moving back and i know it's not anytime soon and they have stuck by me forever!! ok, wait, i am way far ahead of myself.  i mean, AEC is still my best friend and ABC probably won't think shit so i don't know why i'm talking like this.  if i was actually drunk i would have an excuse...  at any rate, i finally got my damn printer to print in red (when i put it on high quality)  how can it say i have 3/4 color cartridge and a little over 1/4 black and then hardly print??!!  you think the fuckers who put these things together are smart enough to do all that shit, they could make the damn ink sensors work!  ok, i'm just being stupid now.   later

       never thought i'd be in this place.   it's someone else's life i'm living.   wish i were living a lie.   the hardest part is when the bough breaks.   falling down and then forgiving.   you didn't kiss me goodbye.   i'm choking on the words i didn't get to say  and pray i get the chance one day.    i still run i still swing open the door.   i still think you'll be there like before.   doesn't everybody out there know to never come 'round?   some things a heart won't listen to.   i'm still holding out for you.    i can hear you're smile in the dark.   i can even feel your breathing.   the daylight chases the ghosts.   i see your coat and i fall apart.   to those hints of you i'm clinging.   now's when i need them most.   i should get up, dry my eyes and move ahead.   at least that's what you would have said.    i still run.   i still swing open the door.   i still think you'll be there like before.   doesn't everybody out there know to never come 'round?  some things a heart won't listen to.   i'm still holding out for you.  faithfully i trace your name while you sleep.   it's the only true comfort i feel.  i still run.   i still swing open the door.   i still think you be there like before.  i still run  i still swing open the door i still think you'll be there like before doesn't everybody out there know to never come 'round? some things a heart won't listen to.   i'm still holding out for you  -SheDaisy

       omg, i can't believe i didn't blog this.  ABC is out of jail!!!  she's in a rehab program for a month & then she'll be out.  yay!!  they went to the salem fair today and AEC found out when so we got to spend, like, 2 hours w/ ABC today.  she held Dylan for the first time.  i wanted to cry it was so sweet.  i'm so glad AEC has found someone to treat her so good and that i'm lucky enough to be good friends w/ her too!  we all made out in the situation (pun intended, but i wasn't involved in that!  lol)  i can't wait till she's free for good.  i was re-reading her letters today and we seem to have so many plans already when she's finally free.

       are there really signs out there or is it when we can't figure it out or handle it the human mind makes you believe there are signs to keep you from going insane? haven't talked to D since 6/28 (no, i'm not obsessive, i was cleaning out my caller id and realized that was the last date.  i actually didn't think it had been THAT long.) how was last night (this morning technically) so good but so bad?  it's what i wanted for so long but to back out in the middle like that??!!  do you know how horrible that made, makes, me feel?  ok, i understand believing that it won't ruin a friendship (although i don't have a problem separating it, but that's just me) but that was a slap to my already torn shreaded burned ego.  at one point he said it's better, i would've regretted it in the morning (this was before.  it was a long night) but i don't regret my decision one bit.  it just makes me feel like there's something wrong w/ me & that's not cool.  especially when it's been building up for so long.  ugh, this is dumb.  there wouldn't be any drama, even in my head, if you hadn't done that.  don't you get it?  that's what the drama is. not what we were doing, but what you did. it's funny that he was my goal, just to see if i could, before i decided to swear off men.  and mission accomplished.  just read my old blog.  well, we all know how well swearing off men went.  but i had decided yesterday to do it again, give up on men.  and who invites me over?  there he is to be the "last" again.  ironic. i know this probably doesn't make a lot of sense.  i'm hurting, but only because i think i lost 2 friends and i don't know what i did. i'm trying not to drink tonite, but i don't think that is going to be possible.  i'm sure i'll be blogging again tonite...

       omg omg omg.  ABC wrote this note and i read it and told her no on certain things and sent it back and she wasn't supposed to send it.  i was gonna have her change it, but i was never gonna let her send it but i guess AEC stole the addy and now D is gonna get this letter and i really don't even know what it says and i am freaking out.  i would rather just not know.  i don't want to be hurt again.  god, i hope he just pretends like he never got it if he doesn't feel the same.  i just want things to stay normal.  i'm shaking.  i don't like people to know my feelings.  i can't get hurt again.  i just can't.
