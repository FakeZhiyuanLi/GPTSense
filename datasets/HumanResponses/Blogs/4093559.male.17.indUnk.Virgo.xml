      Yeah, I'm addicted to  urlLink Star Wars Galaxies . But who isn't? Man. I wasn't alive for the birth of the movies, but I've had my fair share of viewing over the years. And now I get to live it all :D It's a good game. I don't like paying, but it's still good. I'm an architect. And a swordsman. And uh... some other stuff. But yeah. Can't wait for the Space Expansion... make me stop! Oh yeah, and I preordered Battlefront. Looks good. hopefully replaces my old Counterstrike addiction. And  urlLink HP  stuff is cool. I'm tired. Sleep soon? Maybe. Hungry first. Damn 12 hour work day...

       urlLink Slashdot | Hydra vs. Shredder   This is quite interesting. It shows what times we live in, when two computers can play a game like chess and win/defeat each other. The beginning of the end? The birth of the Matrix? Who knows.

      So yeah, I'm about to head off to work for the day... That's right. Sabbath my ass. Anyway, saw Alien vs Predator last night, was pretty sweet. Nice visuals and whatnot, the fight scenes, etc. Storyline kinda blew, but there was an interesting backstory drop for the Predators. I liked it, overall. Went with Wai In (my girlfriend FYI). Was a nice evening. And oh yeah,  urlLink check this out.

      Spent another paycheque on  urlLink this . A nice little camera.. got a sweet deal at Staples (where I work) where if you buy the photosmart 635, they give you the 8886 camera dock for free. I had originally bought the 635, but returned it today to take advantage of this free 100$ dock. :)

      Yeah, it was another one of those nights tonight. Just got in, post-midnight, from another RPG session. You know how it goes. I get picked up from work and we head straight to a basement somewhere to engulf ourselves in the world of Rifts. I must say I do enjoy playing, but the crowd is odd. Ah well, I still GM a d20 Star Wars session. I'm running out of ideas set in the Rebellion era, since it's been explored to death... but I'm trying to figure something out to get these guys going. Most of them leave for school soon, so it'll be me and whatever Juniors I can find who love to RP. Perhaps I'll stumble upon a new worthy group, who knows.  I'm interested to know if anyone out there wants to collaborate on a storyline that I could set up for the guys playing right now.

      So yeah, here it is. I figured I'd give this a try, as I know a lot of people who use Blogger. I dunno. I don't feel as though I have much to say, but who knows. If the inspiration comes, it'll be here.
