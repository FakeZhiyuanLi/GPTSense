      A funny story  Do you ever notice, if you are aimlessly walking down a grocery aisle, how many little kids there are? Some kicking and screaming at their mommy and others completely lost, wandering around searching for their lost relatives! Well, one day I was in Sam's Club, while my parents were there. I was quite bored and was wondering around aimlessly, when something caught my eye. It was a lost little girl. She was walking around looking rather worried that mommy and daddy were no where to be found. Being bored, I decided to follow her and see where she went.  She walked around and around and finally settled on going the the food court. She saw an old couple and decided to ask them if they'd seem her parents.  Well, they hadn't, but invited her to join them in eating ice cream until her parents returned (which they knew they would, as all parents know that children are drawn to food). So for quite some time the happy child continued eating her ice cream, almost forgetting that she even had parents, until they came and saw her.  Where had she been!  They'd look'd all over for her! And dispite the situation they found it rather amusing and often reminded that little girl, when she was growning up, of the time she 'got lost' in Sam's Club. I wonder who that girl was? Oh wait! it was me!

      Its always the little things in life that'll get you through the day. Have you ever started out the day on the wrong side and a simple smile, a "how are you?", or an "it's good to see you today" can brighten your day? Smile today, and make someone elses day just a little bit brighter!

      Of the many wonderful times that I had as a child, I think that one of my favorite memories was of our woods. From about the ages of about 3 to 11, I lived in a house out in West Lafayette where there was lots of woods. Most of my time after schoolwork was done was spent out side in the woods.  It was a cheery wood. Not dark or gray, but full of sunlight, with a merry brook giggling it way through the woods. There were many beautiful flowers out there that covered the ground with their fresh scent, but also there was a peaceful calm where one could just wonder around and be happy.  I remember days when I would be out so long, that i would get hungry and have a snack out there. All summer long the blackberries were juicy and delicious, there were pear and apple trees, and I would even eat the wild onions and mustard plant leafs (which I used to eat all the time!).

      If I could invent any holiday in the month of January, it would definately be on the Monday after the first weekend of January. It would be called National Sleep-in Day. On that day there would be no school so people could, well, sleep in! That day would make the first week of school go a lot faster, as well as console those of us were extremely loathe to go return to school. I would especially appreciate this holiday because the first weekend of January I have three performances of The Nutcracker, not to mention a long week of rehearsals, and setting up and taking down the props, back drops and floors. After five days of five-hour rehearsals each day, three performances seem like nothing.  Still, the energy it takes to go all the way through the ballet with out stopping, and of course still trying to look like ballet is the easiest thing in the world (which it’s not!), when your legs, arms, and toes kill, is so exhausting that it is almost impossible to stay awake and paying attention to teachers early Monday morning.

      One of my first memories as a child was when we lived in our old house in Virginia. I had a favorite stuffed rabbit and I always used to hold her and suck on my two little fingers. I can still hear my mom called for me to see where I was and if I was sucking my fingers again. A very pretty sound that I can still hear is the sound of the ocean. The blue waves lapping on the shore while I swung in a hammock underneath two palm trees on a hot day in Cancun, Mexico. I can still hear the sounds of gray dolphins, I could even hear their friendly clicks while underwater. Its sounds like these that I wish I could recall on freezing days and wrap around me like a warm fuzzy blanket. But I love snow too. Actually the loudest sound that I remember is silence. I can still hear the silence one summer day when a car slammed into the side of our van. I can't recall a word said. Only silence. I also can still hear the silence in a small green car driving through Laffayette as my Mom announced to the family that Dad had cancer. I remember no words, just my mom's brown eyes brimming over in tears.

      This is pretty hard! I spent Wednesday and Thursday of break working eight hours shelling corn and other various jobs. Although it was kind of difficult to talk with ear plugs in I was able to talk to some people that I had worked with last summer and say goodbye to my friend Cory, a senior at Clinton Prairie, who right after graduating is going off to the Marines. I had some bonding time with two chicks both named Amanda, both juniors and Rossville. Both cheerleaders. Need we say more? But it was nice to get to know them better. I also had some bonding time with Jared Layton who is also a junior at Rossville. Through him I learned some things about Faith kids that I didn't know before, and was able to invite him to the Bring 3 tournament in May.  Friday I babysat for two girls that never ran out of energy even when I was pooped, but I was able to help out their family so that was good. So I suppose that I'd say that my favorite memory over break was going shopping on Saturday. Pretty sad, huh? Over all it wasn't bad. Made some money. Talked to friends, studied Bible Quiz (yeh!), and slept!!!!! (a little).

      Man it's only Friday, and I'm already bored of break! It could also have something to do with the fact that I have spent 8 hrs. working every day while the rest of y-all slept in!  I love all ya people my friends! I couldn't get through each day without ya! lesee: BQT: love all my buddies, wouldn't be nearly the same with out ya! and we're really gonna miss Rach. next year!! Alg 2: Too early for math but fun. Between, Annmarie, Chris, and Justin and everyone else we manage to have fun. Eng: a blast! all you guys crack me up! just keep it easy on the 'happy tree friends' tune! Chem: wow. what a class! So thankful for all my friends to keep me sane. Hist: well........JK it's a fun/crazy class. Between Mr. Johns never coming to class (passing out), the guys going to the flag pole after lunch, and many other memories -it's been great. Span: I must say the play has been the hilight of this class. Hope it goes well! (Micah: I still owe you one. :) ).   Well, have a good break all, and C-ya at school.

      When I hear a certain name an image pops in my mind. The name of a person brings up a face and an emotion concerning them, the name of an object usually brings up memories concerning it. So many names belong to certain objects and would not suit any other object.  For example: I cannot imagine a rose being called spinach, but on the other hand if I had grown up hearing a rose called 'spinach' i would never want to call it a rose.   Similarly we tend to grow to love or hate certain names of people depending on how a person by that name acts. I would never name a kid of mine 'Osama' but 'Rebecca' on the other hand, I find to be a beautiful name, just like the person to whom it belongs. We tend to think it's all about a name, but in reality it is the object itself that influences our view of a name.

      How can I say this in only 100 words? This one's hard Ms. Weibe! Lets see. I would like to attend and graduate some college (not sure yet -but not Purdue and not Bob Jones!). My ideal job I think would be acting in a movie. It would obviously depend -on many things, but I think it would be very cool to get paid to do something that I love! Also before I turn 30, I would like to travel -alot. I would like to tour the British isles: England, Scotland, Ireland, all of it! Of all the places in Europe, my first choice to visit would be Italy. Who can resist Italian food, the coliseum in Rome, the gondolas in Venice, and all the rest. I would also like to visit Paris, Sydney, Madrid, and Jerusalem. During my travels I would like to climb a mountain, explore in a castle, see all the biblical sights of Jeruralem, go skydiving, surfing and rock climbing.  I would like to get married sometime, but of course that all depends on who comes along:) .

      It's almost eleven on Friday the ninth, and I'm already bored! One of those things where you spend all your time doing nothing and then wonder where the time went. Anyway I thought I'd just share some of my random thoughts on Good Friday with y'all.  Why is it called 'Good Friday'? Other than refering to the fact that we have no school.... I would almost tend to think of it as being 'bad Friday' because today is when we recognize Jesus' death on the cross. Good? not when you first think about it but-yes! Because if today had never happened and I was sitting in Chemistry class like I would be on a normal Friday at this time, I would be doomed to live forever away from God! The thought seems almost unreal. I sit here with all my comforts taking God's grace for granted. I am so selfish! I don't even begin to deserve all that I have! And God even grants my smallest wishes! (For example I really wanted to be in the school play. I prayed to God, and I have a fairly large part!). And when sometimes it is not his will to grant my desires, I get upset!!! God wants the best for my life and I have absolutely NO reason to get upset when things don't go my way! OK so thanx for staying there with me. I hope that Passion Play goes well! Good luck, and sing well all my sophomore choir friends!

      Ballet shoes- beautiful, graceful, and creative, you enjoy dancing writing and music. You are often very poetic and sometimes dramatic. You keep to yourself aside from a few close friends that you can relate.  quizilla.com

      Yes, today is the day opening night of Anne of Green Gables. (Huzzah!). And Yes, Ms. Wiebe this is part of my relaxation-ness before I have to get made-up and put on frilly dresses etc. . This whole experience (my first) has been a lot of fun and I've gotten to know all my fellow actors more....than I ever cared to sometimes. :) I know all of our tempers have been tested and the stress levels have hit the roof, but I think (and pray) that we'll manage to pull it all together tonight. Good luck all! Now here are some comments to my fellow cast..... Regina:yay! It's been alot of fun with you as my fellow student, and I am NOT dead gone on charlie sloane (I win). Jordan: you do really well as Jane, smile! Eve: You are such a good actoress! Its been fun 'hating' you. Bethany: I'm sure you're tired of hearing it but you do really well as Rachel Lynde. Don't stress out! Scott: good job as my teacher (esp. w/ Prissy :) ). Luke: You're so much fun and I'll forgive you for putting leaves in my hair. -maybe. Sam: ha, ha. Don't forget those multiplication tables! Rebecca: It has been so divine doing the tea party scene with you! Deborah: you are SUCH a good Diana. You do a good job of acting drunk! :) Rachel: I love your Aunt Josephine hobble.  There are a lot more but 30 is too many to put everyone down, so I love you all, thanks to all the crews: you rock and also to all of you who came to see us: it wouldn't have been the same w/o you. Thanx

      Will I ever make it to the end of the year? Sometimes I think not. I'm sure the purpose of this is to get us to be motivated to end the year well, but.... and honestly we all have those days when we don't care. -about anything. This whole week has been an 'i-don't-care' week. I don't care what I look like, I don't care what anyone thinks about me and I don't care how I do in school. I know this is selfish and I really do care, just not right now. When my report card comes in, I will care. When my parets are upset with me, I will care. I just need to use that motivation to care NOW. (not working).  But just so you know that I do care about some things: I care about the school play. It has been alot of fun and I cared enough about it last night to spend a good (long) hour to rip stich-by-stich the tuck in a costume for the play, just so it would be long enough. I also care enough about the play to read through the entire series to get an idea about my character and the story, but also because it is a very good series. I won't say anything about memorizing my lines, but the bottom line is (ha,ha) that I DO care about something. So there is my motivation and I WILL make it through the rest of the school year! ....I hope.

      I am so bored! I have WAY too much time on my hands, esp. after a stressful/long weekend of ballet performances. And so here is my honest opinion of some of my teachers....  Mrs. Hume: Is so cool. She helps bible quiz have a comfortable, fun but good atmosphere. We have such great fun in that class.  Mr. Harmless: Is very good. Not just cuz i'm more of a 'math' person than say science, but he makes math, interesting, relevant, and we have lots of fun in class as well as being able to learn alot.  Ms. Weibe: doesn't get appreciated nearly enough, but is SOOOOO GOOD. She must be so stressed out, and our class certainly doesn' t help, but she makes English interesting (and that is a hard feat!), we have fun, and really do learn a LOT!  Mr. Johns: I must say there have been times when I have thought him a little unfair (when teaching BQ, making seating charts, and grading tests), but he is a good teacher and I am able to find history interesting enough. We do the craziest things in that class, and I have enough memories to last a lifetime! But he manages (somehow), to keep order and balance.  Mrs. Leitke: Wow, spanish 3. What a fun class.... Anywho, she is a good teacher, southern accent, crazy laugh and all. Many crazy memorys from this class too...  Mr. Heim: Although I don't completely understand him, I have a lot of respect for him and he does a good job of shutting up certain (ahem) guys who don't know the meaning of "be quiet!"  Ms. Syr: Lots of fun in health/P.E. I'm so glad we're going to Love'!

      Yay for random! I was just reading some of y-alls blogs and felt inspired.  Firstly: Blogs are so nice because you can write your honest opinion and be spared the trouble of someone's immediate reactions. You only run into trouble when s-one who should not have read your blog, reads it....(not to name any names). But about opinions, its great that people can feel spiritually inspired about taking leadership and not goofing off, but in all honesty was it really worth all the time to write it out, or is some action REALLY gonna be taken' ? Just a little encouragement to follow through with your words.:)  Secondly: I love books! I know some of y'all don't appreciate them as much as me, but fiction rules! It's so nice, when life sucks, and problems flood you, to distract yourself by stepping into another place, or another point in time (that is-after you've made things right with God). I recently finnish reading A THORN IN MY HEART, which is a WONDERFUL story, taken from the one of Jacob and Essau, and Rachel and Leah, but in Scottland and in a different year. I think I told lots of you about it, or else you asked me why I was bawling my eyes out in school... :) . It took a whole different perspective on that story, and I found a lot more in common with 'Leah' than I would have thought, and although fiction, this story encouraged me to stay close to God, even when he answers "no" to your prayer requests.  I love ya all, and C-ya 2morrow!

      ....back again!... Hey to all my friends who read this (namely: Emily. You rock!). I wanted to go to church last night to see y'all but the flight from Chicago to Indy got canceled, so that meant a four hour trip by limo down to Indy to pick up the van and return here to good 'ol Lafayette! y'know: as great as summer is, sometimes I just hate it cuz its full (for me) of selfish discontentment. School ends, i don't want it to. I go on vacation, I dont really want to, I come back, and I dont really want to. Dont get me wrong. I luv y'all, but only now do i realize what an awesome vacation it was and I miss it. ( that and the fact that I realize you all will leave 4 smite soon and I have to work in the freakin' corn!).  Thankfully two weeks out of corn season will be spent in Indy at a ballet camp, which is really cool except I haven't taken a class since, oh the middle of may, and dancers are all expected to be skinny minnies and bendy wendys. So now I'm gonna say farewell and get off my lazy bum and see what I can do about the extra vacation pounds! :)

      Im here in Peru and I finally found a computer! Yay! I Miss you all soooooo much! Im in Lima and just spent a week in Cuzco. Its so cold!!! I really miss summer! But it is like Indiana in the sense that its really humid in Lima and the hair is a frizz ball! Well cuzco was really pretty and Ill have to show you all the pictures cuz i really cant describe. Ive been to Macchu Picchu and all sorts of other Incan ruins around cuzco. Also went to lake Titicaca (think WAY back to geography class) and visited the floating reed islands etc. .   Today we visited the main plaza of Lima: including cathedrals and the museum of the inquisition. Its kinda depressing really how catholic south america was and is. I mean there are catherdrals everywhere and they are the nicest buildings in the city. I mean painting upon painting, statues, gold plated altars, candles-the works!- how can you make a sinful mortal such as Mary to be a god. And how can you put God in a box and say that this crucifix is how he was and all that he was. that he came to die. Thats not the end of the story! To worship a little idol and just by rich decorations and money and burning candles, you can somehow win God´s approval into heaven. And also how people would be tortured for not being exactly as the church wanted!   The food here is not as bad as i expected! I havent had too much seafood (yet), and IncaCola and Fanta keep me sane. That and the movies on tv that are in English with span. subtitles. no, peru is pretty cool but i still miss you all and cant wait to come back home!!!! luv y´all,  turz

Well not really: it's just that three weeks away from y'all is a really long time! tear, tear... Random moode.  Well i'm off to cuzco-topia! C'ya all when I get back and have a wonderful summer. I'll be thinking about you all. Yes that means you even if you don't think this applies.  (told you I'm in a random moode!) luv,  Turza P.S: as much as I hate to admit this............

      Ever noticed how fast the summer goes? School just let out and we're starting again!!! My best wishes go out to the SMITE teams down sweating in the Bahamas, or freezing in Peru-hope to see you all soon!  Not much is up now with me. I got back last night from spending two weeks in Indianapolis at a ballet camp. It was quite an experience, and more than I could ever write, in one blog. The first three days I thought I'd never make it, but it was so much fun. Dancing 5 hours a day is a lot.  Other than the standard technique and pointe classes there were... Acting: my favorite class! always humorous with lots of improvisation. Variations/repretoire: we learns variations from Don Quiote, and other ballets Modern: Greggory hancock taught us a really fun indian dance Partnering: Ha! I'm so bad at it! Especially with a 6'5" professional Russian guy! ( who wore WAY too much cologne)  we performed several dances on Friday night at a theatre in the University of Indy, in beautiful tutu's and other fun costumes. Well, I'll stop now before you are all bored, so have a great summer (or what's left of it!)
