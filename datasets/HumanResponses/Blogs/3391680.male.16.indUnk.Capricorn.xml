      My first two posts were in response to articles I had found, and rebutted their arguments. With this one, I plan to take a different direction and use a more original perspective.  Let's take a moment to reflect on a recent Massachusetts court ruling allowing two people of the same sex to participate in possibly the highest moral institution this country recognizes. The proponents of gay marriage will have you believe this is a civil rights movement comparable to the true civil rights movement of the Sixties. Not only does this trivialize that great step forward in American history, but it also leads many to believe homosexuals are discriminated against by our government. A similar "civil rights movement" occured in Sweden a few years back, allowing gays to marry. As a result of this, the number of Swedes with a sexually transmitted disease has steadily increased. Now our nation is already under the stress of an STD epidemic with around half of all sexually active Americans with some sort of STD. Do we need to add to this problem?  The proponents of gay marriage seem to have the delusion that marriage is simply intended for two people who love each other. Sorry to inform you, but marriage is also the only institution in the world that ensures that a child is raised by two parents. Certainly marriage does have something to do with two people loving each other, but you cannot deny that children are more times than not an integral part of marriage.  Lastly, as a nation, we must ask ourselves down what road we are leading the moral foundation of our great civilization? If marriage is simply about love, how can we deny five different people who love each other the rights of marriage? (think polygamy) If marriage is simply about love, how can we deny a mother and her son the rights of marriage? (think incest) If marriage is simply about love how can we deny a man and his goat the rights of marriage? (think beastiality) All three of the aforementioned acts are illegal according to U.S. law, but you can't help but wonder if they will remain so if the onset of homosexual marriage is to occur.

       I hope you people love the American Civil Liberties Union ( urlLink ACLU ) as much as I do. They supposedly fight for the rights of of the little man in America, when in reality all they do is push the liberal agenda, masquerading as liberty fighters. Benjamin Franklin: Liberty Fighter. Martin Luther King Jr.: Liberty Fighter. American Civil Liberties Union: Liberal Bullshit Propaganda.  Anyway, while I was skimming around their site, I happened to stumble across  urlLink this . For those of you too lazy to click a link, it's all about the recent ban on partial birth abortion. The article starts with a quote by Chief Judge Richard A. Posner. "(T)he public support of the laws was also based . . . on sheer ignorance . . . . " Thank you Judge Posner. With a full arsenal of network news stations, newspapers, and magazines, as well as propaganda medians like the ACLU, promoting the heinous act of crushing the skull of a baby, seconds from being born, and tearing his appendages off as he flails around in vein, is impossible because of us cotton-farmin', NASCAR watchin', Bible preachin', ignorant people in the general public. I think what Judge Posner meant was that the public support for the ban was based on our, ever so awful, high regard for human life.   After the quote, the Union rephrases two main points about three times. The first being: "the bans prevent doctors from performing abortions as early as 13 weeks in pregnancy," No, sorry. The ban prohibits abortions to babies who are in the process of being born. If a premature baby is about to be born only after 13 weeks into the pregnancy, then no, sorry Doctor, you can't end this innocent child's life. The ban only applies to women in labor, because to kill a baby in the process of being born isn't a medical procedure. It's a thing I like to call, "infanticide."  Their second point is that partial birth abortions "impermissibly endanger women's health." Let's get beyond the obvious fact that they offer no evidence to back this up other than the fact that partial birth abortion bans offer no health clause. Anyone want to take a guess at why partial birth abortion bans offer no health clause? Because partial birth abortions are never, I repeat,  never  necessary to save a woman's life. Besides this being a medical fact, one can infer this just by common knowledge. The only time giving birth will endanger a woman's life is during the actual birthing process. Partial birth abortions require the woman to almost deliver her child, then the child is slaughtered, and she delivers the remains. The process is identical to giving birth except for the child is delivered with a crushed skull, and dead on arrival. Here's a little side fact I'd throw into the mix: The American Health Association condemns partial birth abortions. So according to the ACLU, the partial birth abortion ban is unnecessary, because: a) women are not allowed to abort a prematurely born baby, which, by definition is partially born; and b) the ban does not offer any medical protection to the thousands of women out there who never need a partial-birth abortion for their own health.

        Every once in a while, I like to make a visit to my good friends,   urlLink Al Jazeera . During this endeavor, I ran across some really nifty items. One really stood out in particular though. You all remember Nicholas Berg, right? Some of you network fans out there might have missed this whole thing, due to the massive overcoverage of the Abu Ghraib prison story, so I'll summarize it for you. An American civilian in Iraq, Nicholas Berg, decided he could make a few honest bucks conducting some business in unfriendly Iraq. Somehow, the enemy forces captured Berg, and on a video released to the media, they did something to him, that makes a man pyramid and a dog collar seem like... well... a man pyramid and a dog collar.  First they read this giant schpiel about how America is the "great Satan." Yadda yadda yadda. Then one of the cowards, armed with a large machette, grabbed Berg, and held him to the floor and began to saw away at his head. Not slice. Not hack. Saw. While the rest of them started screaming "Praise Allah!" When the butcher finally finished his work, he held Berg's severed head up for the camera, blood dripping from the stump left of a neck.    Anyway, back to Al Jazeera.  urlLink One article  is a feature done about Berg's father. Berg's father blames the "policies of the Bush adminstration" for the terrible thing that happened to his son. I guess Berg's father missed the whole scene of his son screaming in agony as the blade carried by a man praising Allah, slowly ripped through his son's neck. Michael Berg (the father) also says that Bush's "ineffective leadership is a weapon of mass destruction." I think he might have missed the whole sarin gas incident our troops encountered a couple of days ago.   They also note that Nicholas Berg (the victim) had intended to leave Iraq earlier than he was allowed due to detention. Berg was scheduled to leave March 30. He was missing from March 24. Damn that detention! Damn it to hell! We all know how willing the Iraqis would have been had Berg been allowed to leave six days after his capture.   Now up until this point I thought I'd have a little pity on the father, you know losing a loved one and all, has got to put a lot of strain on the mind, enough to impair correct judgement even. After reading this, I realized my asessment was totally wrong and Nick Berg's father is a lunatic. Michael Berg in response to what we should have done after September 11: "I say we should have done then what we never did before: Stop speaking to the people we labelled our enemies and start listening to them." Pure genius, my friends. Pure genius. Mercilessly salughtering over 2,000 innocent Americans is obviously a warning sign of a group wanting to talk things out. Maybe we should have just started listening to Hitler. I also like his point that we label them as enemies. Nevermind the thousands of radical Muslim references to America as the "great Satan." Nevermind the burning corpses of the Halliburton employees. Nevermind the capture and murder of Daniel Pearl, a reporter in Afghanistan. Nevermind those 2,000 aforementioned killed on September 11. Nevermind the ruthless decapitation of your own son Mr. Berg.    Berg later declares, "Stop making up rules by which others must live and then separate rules for ourselves." Damn right. For every American that plans to sneak into a Sbarro Pizza, with a vest full of  explosives only intended for  killing civillians, send him to prison. Why stop there, any American who tries to sneak a shoe bomb onto a commercial plane: Prison. I like your thinking Berg.

        I recently purchased the Book  Brainwashed  by Ben Shapiro which details liberal bias all over campuses across the U.S. I haven't finished the book yet, but when I do, a book review will surely be posted. Here's an excerpt I found to be very entertaining and disturbing called "Strange, Strange Behavior" from the chapter "Sex in the Classroom."     A few professors have interesting perspectives on bestiality as well. It's fine, as long as you're not too cruel to the animal.   Ugh.   The strangest of the strange is Professor Peter Singer of Princeton University, who wrote an essay for  Nerve Magazine  in which he lauded that noblest of human activities, bestiality. "Sex with animals does not always involve cruelty," writes Singer. "Who has not been at a social occasion disrupted by the household dog gripping the legs of a visitor and vigorously rubbing its penis against them? The hos usually discourages such activities, but in private not everyone objects to being used by her or his dog in this way, and occasionally mutually satisfying activities may develop." Um...  what?  Maybe Professor Singer thinks it's "mutually satisfying" to make mad, passionate love to Fido, but we in the real world call that disgusting.     And there are many more who do more than walk their dog. Harvard Professor Marjorie Garber, director of the university's Center for Literary and Cultural Studies, wrote an entire book on puppy obsession, entitled  Dog Love.  "Animal contacts... have had a long and honorable history in sexual  fantasy life ," Garber notes. "Behavior that appears (in practice) as a primary violation of boundary between humans and animals turns out to be (in figure) foundational to received notions of 'culture' and 'civilization.'"     With the "honorable history" of bestiality in mind, Garber gleefully recounts literary and real-life cases of bestiality in her chapter "Sex and the Single Dog." Perhaps the most egregious example is her account from Laura Reese's   Topping from Below,  describing a "love scene" with a Great Dane. Every woman's fantasy--making out with Marmaduke. Revolting? Disgraeful? Absolutely. But what else should we expect from Professor Graber, the author of such great works as  Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life  and  Vested Interests: Cross-Dressing and Cultural Anxiety?

      I apologize for not posting in a while, but I have several posts planned for the next week.    About a week ago I saw  Farenheit 911 , the controversial film which spends two full hours trashing the Bush administration. Some small portions of the film I was unable to enjoy due to applause and insightful comments like, "yeah!" and "right on!" given by the democrats in the theater (yes, there are democrats in Texas). When Michael Moore isn't making fun of how Paul Wolfowitz does his hair before a camera appearance, he is usually trying to bring the viewer down some meandering path that somehow connects President Bush and Osama bin Laden. I am not going to try to debunk, point by point, the entire movie, but I will point out some things about the film that really stood out to me.     On the very opening scene of the movie, Moore tries to make it look like the racist Supreme Court stole the election for George W. Bush. What Moore leaves out is that several independant recounts actually found out that Bush won the election (You mean Moore left important facts out, well I never...) After this, Moore tries to link Bush to those terrible Saudis and bin Laden's family hoping that the casual viewer doesn't know that the rest of Osama's family disowned him.     It's just little things like this that stand out to me about the movie that sit and make me wonder does anyone actually believe this?
