      dreamer are those who,,, seek dreamz.dream supose to be nice and wonderful... everything in it should be perfect...perfection..who dun wish to hab it? but de problem is who got it?.... none..! u gain something , at de other hand u lost something...walking on de street, i see no perfection.... for those who seek power, i see wat they lost... humanity...for those who seek love, at de other hand lost it... cos they grab it too hard... and dat cause them to lost it.. if u love someone , let her go.. cos ...,de harder u hold, de more suffocate he/she is...can i really let go? no.. i cant. i ain't saint.. but all i can do is put her in my memory box... i tried to run away frm reality too... in de end i failed.. but who cares.? seek love ... seek memories.... seek dreamz.. dream-chaser....sheen.
