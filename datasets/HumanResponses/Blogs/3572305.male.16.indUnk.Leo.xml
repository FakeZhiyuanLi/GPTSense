      I did a few things over the night, scout people in CS, organize my photogallery, make wallpapers, pirate the alpha testing version of Longhorn, you know...the usual.  Longhorn was so incredibly slow that i just put Slack 9.1 back on, although 10.0 would be good too but all the mirrors are down :/  here are screenshots of Longhorn, CS, and the wallpapers: http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v293/linux_fish/Counter-strike/?

      I finally saw something that Maddox hasn't done, although it's done in the traditional Maddox fashion (intelligent yet you'd have to be out of your mind to believe it)  here it is: http://www.aethiamud.org/communist_mario/index.html  read the comic too, theres a link to it at the bottom it's a dramatization, here are tidbits:  Hmm a flag with the peace symbol on it.  Your militant dictatorship can't have that, now can it Mario?  Video game heroes are traditionally people we would like to emulate.  Sonic the Hedgehog is fast and quick-witted.  The Contra commandos are total badasses, even if they die in 1 hit.  And Link wields a cool sword and has a harem of hot fairy bitches waiting off of him.  What kid worth his legos wouldn't want to be any of these fine role models?   Princess: Thank you for saving me Mario! Mario: Surrender your crown pig-bitch.

      the storm fucked up my computer but i modified the filesystem and it's good now, besides the entire "i need a fucking new psu because my case sucks" thing. once i get a new psu i'll start playing counter-strike and ut2k4 on this (slackware) box, right now i'm just using my optical mouse and 17" lcd screen right now which is working pretty nice for owning with the scout.

      my computer is 1337, i'm going to see how long i can keep it on without it getting laggy and dying which probably will be forever since slackware > you. in other news i'm thinking of reformatting this blog just for the hell of it since i have nothing to do anymore.  new AIM name: slackware kun, theres this kid in central that was pissing me off and i didn't feel like cleaning out my buddylist so this is what resulted

      i just realized how weird i am, i use linux, i eat cereal out of cups, and i'm one of the few people that will convulse with laughter at the modest mouse "float on" video, also i'm one of the only people that trampolines to get energy after 5 hours of crap.

      the 3 days without internet were mostly because i've been trying to get online in slackware/debian i have no idea why i can't connect, but i installed everything on xp and i should be good to go for any LAN parties for a while, i'll just do some research then go back to slackware forever, if not then i'm fucked XD   huge ass thunderstorm knocked me off the megatokyo forums for a while but when i return i get Char trying to ban me and squall :Death: but he lets crap like this go by:  http://heika-love.cool.ne.jp/troubled_windows.html  translated text here: ["When you watch TV, please turn on the lights and sit away from the TV."]  Me!

      How you know you're getting good:  People fear you, example: the entire terrorist team refused to go short or long a because they knew I always cover both. another example is:  people start to cry because they're not as good as you so they say "H4X!!!" and ban you  I've been banned from 29 servers, for "hacking" and all I was using was scout.

      This sucks, hardcore, I'm at sean's LAN and it's very gayed because of Javi, although i don't have a problem with him he takes up too much space and he talks to himself. Not to mention the fact that with another computer and another person in the room it's a lot hotter than normal.  Post summed up: Gayed.

      i decided to start doing a webcomic, just for the hell of it, not really a webcomic but i'm going to put up doodles of crap i've done in school. the characters suck on purpose because with badly drawn characters it's all about the content, and that way i don't disappoint the viewers if i don't draw as good because hey, it was crap to begin with.  Hello my name is george dubyuh bush and i approved this message:  John Kerry says he's the author of the strategy to stop terrorism, but he's only fighting the war against the japanese Yah-koo-zah  then they show this image:   i shit you not, there was no editing there here is the link:  http://www.georgewbush.com/KerryMediaCenter/ under Yakuza

      the LAN party was pretty nice, although i didn't have my luxurious 17" lcd with me i still managed to play cs well enough. after much cs everybody started passing out, so we went to my house, i shot a few things with my airsoft guns, got my money then we went to publix for a case of bawls. after that, there was trampolining, after that more Bawls then me and flavio went to the pool, we asked a black guy for 2 dollars to get into the pool and i changed into the shorts i stole from sean's closet, we saw who could swim best, who could hold their breath longest, and left because there were these black girls ogling us. after we got back flavio passed out on the trampoline, and kraig's mom called so he left, i left at about the same time through the back then i stayed awake until about 10 then i just passed out while watching tv.
