      I had my AoQ board today and I think I did pretty well. I got every question right, and I played the game properly. I don't understand how demonstrating knowledge of the unwritten protocol of the Board is supposed to prove that you were the best Airman for an entire quarter.  I had Ice cream, XX Lager and Queso Flameado, chips salsa beans & rice. I also had dirty rice for lunch.

      I ate at a new place today, The Marina. Burger and Onion rings were pretty good, washed down with a frosty Red Stripe. I had two mock quarterly boards, and I got every question right. I hope the questions are that easy on the real board.

      Brandi drug me to see The Notebook. It was a sappy movie, with so many over the top tear jerker moments, it was like they wanted to get people to cry. It was a definite "lifetime" movie. Good things: I slept in. I ate at IHOP, and had my favorite, Swedish "crepe-style"(tm) pancakes. The swedish is in my bum, not the other way around,  urlLink as Tom Green would allege.  Brandi helped straighten out my office. I played  urlLink KoL.

      I thought what the hell, I'll try this blog thing that all the kids are doing these days. In order to force myself to become more positive, I will make myself post the good things that happened each day.  To get things started, I will be positive by saying that I predict that I will stick to this endeavor at least for a couple of days. A few good things happened today. I got off of work early, at 1400. I didn't even make it into work until 0900, due to my GI tract not agreeing with my culinary choices the previous night. I then went to a going away luncheon for a co-worker and friend, and a Retirement ceremony for a 20 year Master Sergeant. I am currently eating Peach Melba Jello shots made with sugar free peach Jello, and Smirnoff Raspberry Twist Vodka. That is all

      Took my BizComm final. was a breeze. Also got my paper back. I was totally stressing over it, when i just 1/4 assed it, and got an 84.  Today was a good day. I showed up this cocky SSgt in HG, who thinks he has his shit down, because he was in HG somewhere else for a few years. We said we'd do 10 p/u everytime we fucked up. He ended up doing 30, I did 10, for the hell of it.  Talked to a guy in the BX parking lot. He has a nogaro blue S4, and just wanted to shoot the shit with a fellow S4 owner. I love my car.

      I used my new edger today. I edged, and trenched up some sod around these incoveniently shaped hexagonal pavers. I transplanted the sod to a barren spot in the corner of the yard. I also wathed A&E's series  urlLink Airline . Its another of a new breed of real Reality shows. Its more like documentary cum reality show, verses all this island & blind marriage crap that has been polluting the airwaves. It's a blast watching how all these supposed adults get bent out of shape, usually after they have to deal with the consequences of a bad decision they made, like losing a ticket, or arriving late. It has made me be more sensitive regarding how cranky I get in public. I can't help it, I'm doing my part to reinforce the loud obnoxious American stereotype. I am also enjoying Bravo's  urlLink Blow Out . Its based in Cali, so it's only quasi-reality. I honestly don't think that anyone that lives in the LA area has a firm grip on reality, hell, they don't even know what a wal-mart is. I did have some good things today. I tried this new no-sugar added Neopolitan Ice Cream. It was pretty good. Brandi, in a moment of weakness, bought a pack of pre-made chocolate chunk cookies. In my own moment of weakness, I proceeded to make a dozen of them, and eat a baker's half-dozen (that's 6+1). I watched a whole season of Airline on A&E, and Moonraker on Spike. I bought a tanning bed for my clan in KoL

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Republicans dip freedom fries in "W Ketchup", not Heinz  Several humerous quotes from this article: "Choose Heinz and you're supporting Teresa and her husband's Gulfstream Jet, and liberal causes such as Kerry for President," [W Ketchup] warns.  If liberal is restoring our freedoms guaranteed by the bill of rights, by getting rid of the doubleplusgood U.S. Patriot Act. Then I'm all for liberal issues, I guess  "Thank you for giving us a delicious American alternative to the standard Heinz Ketchup. Henry Heinz may have been a great American, but I have absolutely no interest in supporting The Kerry's anti-American causes," wrote "S.S" of Akron, Ohio.  If you're not republican, then you're un-American. Someone needs to remind S.S. of Akron of the founding principles and principals of this nation. T. Jefferson must have been anti-American.  WE NEED MORE PATRIOTS LIKE S.S. of OHIO   The funniest part was at the end, apparently sheep... I mean real American Patriots with capital started an Ice Cream Co. with flavors like I Hate The French VANILLA (Real American Vanilla, NOT French Vanilla)" and "Nutty Environmentalist (Rich Buttery Ice Cream with Roasted Pecans)."
