      heeey errrybody i hope youve been checkin the profile daily to get the news on how my life is going! if you have, you havnt seen anything in a few days i think... anyway, i just felt like writing how the week/weekend has been so far. im at "b-a-d"'s house right now, its like 12:40&nbsp;and weve had actually a pretty fun day. we got up around 12, and brad played a VIDEO GAME! how fun lol... nah it was ok, i was just laying there sleeping pretty much. then we went and cut grass for about two and a half hours. that was cool... after that, we started working on a song just for the hell of it. we had just finished the remix to a song i made last night. you can listen to it here:  urlLink http://www.soundclick.com/bands/0/cthasupermanmusic.htm &nbsp; &nbsp; i think you can just click there then go to the song titled "get the fuukk down"... i thought it was funny when i made it (cause of the end) &nbsp; anyway, me and brad made the remix to that... but brad is sort of bad at recording so it took about 100000 takes to get it...............then.................. he didnt like it. so he rewrote most of it and it took about 100000 more takes to get it...&nbsp;oh wait he still hasnt, so we actually aren't done lol.  oh, gotta go... but i might say more later....FUN WEEKEND!

       PHYLICIA!  man... this guuurl.... she just has this personality that makes you laugh... not at her, with her lol. its sort of messed up tho... simone and her are friends, and they are actually better friends than they were before because of me. i knew phylicia befor simone, and she always made it seem like she really liked me or thought i was hot (tho im not THAT great). shed be trippin all bad, but i thought it was just fun and games cause she had never even SEEN me before. so i didnt really take heed to all of the signs. then there was the fact that people were telling me that simone liked me, and samantha was oing her weird stuff and "sort of kinda maybe one day possibly almost starting to wanna get near to sort of thinking about almost liking me a little tiny bit", and this was ALL while i was with sophie (who is pretty messed up by the way). so i just laughed about the whole situation. then me and sophie broke up... then it got weird. most people kno of the crazy antics of me, simone, and smantha, but if you dont then TOO FUCKIN BAD hahaha. anyway, phylicia was always in the picture, but i couldnt take it TOO seriously, cause i didnt wanna go with a girl i had NEVER seen. tho... isaac told me she was hot, and he does help me make a lot of decisions... but yeah, i wasnt gonna get with a gurl that i COULDNT see ever or talk to on the phone with a lot. so... i igured it would be better to be friends... and we did... now shes like one of my best girl friends, and i talk to her about like errrything. its funny cause with both of us, we are always the people giving advice to friends, so now we had somebody to get advice from, so i did that repediatly. theeeeeennnn there was simone... ("dan dan daaaannnn" ~klarissa~) im so glad i got to know her over this time. shes a cool person to me... well RECENTLY... nevermind, thats another post. but yeah, phylicia! prefect! nice! hot! anndddd some other qualities i dont wanna say lol. but yeah, basically im jsut happy to have somebody DIFFERENT than others, but not in a way thats gonna get me called stupid and wrong and cussed at lol. the think is... simone and sophie were more similar than i had ever wanted to admit... from their history, to their parents, to their personalities... well actually simone is cooler is some areas, but sophie is cooler in others. but phylicia is DIFFERENT, shes more like me... just she keeps me entertained and laughin all the time. plus, she can make me smile from just lookin at me right lol and thats a big accomplishment lol. but YUP shes a girl to take home to momma... she works and she gets her education...  "thats some good shit right there" anywaysssssssssssssssssss talk later... gotta go to sleeeeeep!

"you kno what... ima hurt you" lol yeah, nesha... thats a really cool girl. i didnt think that antwuane actually talked to cool people that id like. its funny cause when i first saw her i was like "that girl is really messed up... shes bein all mean to twuane" but i guess that was just it... she was just mean to twuane. lol she was really nice to me tho. it seems like ive known her for a LOT longer than a few weeks.... i remember how i though she liked me haha... funny... YUP!  i love knowing cool people  ~SUPERMAN!~

      i just wrote sooo much, and it just got erased lol ok.. ill have to write that stuff later but yeah... i wrote all about simone, and nesha... DAMN, that was basically the whole blog... lol  yeaahhhh.... Simone...(gosh i wrote a lot) ok "back to the beggining" i just read simones blog... it basically was about me for today. it was about the whole "us not talking anymore" thing. its weird... i wish things were different, but at the same time, i am having fun with phylicia, and simone jsut seems to keep getting meaner. like on the phone on saturday...friday... no saturday. she was yelling at me about me being wrong about her tryna play me, (tho i still think she DID even if it wasnt on purpose). she was yelling and crying and yelling and tryna make me feel wrong for assuming... but FUCK THAT! i wasnt wrong for a assuming... everyone got that SAME message. so we were talking and i was like "well how am I wrong, everyone agreed with me, i had a right to feel like i was getting played" and she actually said what i didtn think anybody would say without joking... she was like "well everyone is wrong except me!" so at that point, i was like "YUP! forget it!".... now i  read her blog, and shes saying how she doesnt even care. it doesnt really make any sense... but yeah, let me get back to you all nosey people later

      yeah... so its been liek 5 minutes, and i can write something now. basically i couldnt before cause i have nosey ass people here. but YUP! my life is soo weird right now.... lets see:  1. Im single (still not used to iteven tho its been like 4 months... well im used to it, but im NOT reaady for another 10 monther) 2. girls are crazy (i have begun to realize that im not the ugliest guy in the world. it seems like a lot more girls like me now that im single from the evil clutchess of sophie. when i was younger it would happpen, but it would be like, when i had a girl, other girls liked me. but when i was single, "Hell nah i dont like him!" well thats what i assumed. so now its weird wehn you can tell a girl likes you.) 3. Phylicia and I are "whatnot-ing" (this is actually a cool part of my life, not so weird, wait, yeah its werid. like, there once was a girl named simone. now dont get me wrong... simone is still there and shell always be a part of the life of Superman to an extent. but things got messed up with that a little while ago. but yeah, with me and phylicia, its like we were there all the time, but we never got together. we talked for a little while, but it didnt work cause of parents, phone stuff, accesbility... other people. but i guess that stuff isnt a problem now. its like cool cause she seems to be the perfect girl. or one of the few that ive ever known.... crazy, open, pretty...sexy (lol corny), caring, affectionate, not Prudish. there are more, but i dont wanna write them all (it would take 18 pages). basically im in "trip mode" cause i keep thinking about this one girl. that doesnt usually happen. its happened one or two other times in my life. so now we are talking and its Great. there are still a couple or limiting factors tho. but whatever... maybe later) 4. Family/friends are changing (or maybe its me. its like weird hanging out with isaac and brad now sort of. its like with isaac, i might want to go to a girls house or to see a friend, and hell have to be there. but liek i dont ALWAYS want him to tag a long. but isaac is still my best buddy. with brad tho... its weird. he just seems to be getting different than me more everyday. he criticized me for hanging out with this girl, and hes even called me a "slut" (even tho i havnt done anything). its like, he doesnt talk to girls, jsut anthony and billy, then he is so unresponsive. he doesnt get excited about anything except for this game that he wants to buy. i cant go to parties with him cause he wouldnt wanna dance, and he would just get bored and want to leave. i dont kno if its me changing or him changing but i kno somebody is. its most likely me tho, i like hanging with raymond and antwuane more nowdays, and i really dont liek a lot of my family anymore. its like they are all mean and kuniving. i think everyone in my family starts saying that as they get older tho. idk... i think im just maturing.) 5. my grandpa is dying (this actually sucks really bad. hes been ill for a minute now, but it is just soo wack to know that its coming really soon. when i found out... that was the first time i had cried in longer than i could ever remember, but now its like... i cant cry about it, but it makes me just as sad. i guess he is pretty old, but he never seemd old until he got this colon cancer shit. man... its so depressing. but at least i kno its coming. if my grandma goes tho, thats gonna kill me too...)  well, my life is sooooo weird, like i said before ups and downs, and ups and downs, but somehow i can always give off the appearance that everything is cool. i guess you really have to know me to kno whats really up. ~~cya~~

      i keep reading more and more and MORE about stuff that involves me... from simone, to samantha, to klarissa, to ariel, to even isaac.  so..... hopefully this will clear it up...    Ok, people, here it is.... me and Phylicia have known each other for a LONG time (since like January), and through this time, we have been really good freinds ever since. she had always been the girl i talk to, and tell my problems, cause usually no body listens to my problems and i just listen to other peoples problems. but with phylicia it was different, and we could actually talk to each other for real, it didnt feel like i had to be a certain type of person at all...probly cause i hadnt even ever seen her before... ever. so it wasnt even like i could like her like that, you kno?  well eventually i met simone and klarissa. we went bowling and stuff, and we had seen each other and stuff. it was like "ok, those are some pretty cool people."  so ISAAC and KLARISSA got together, this was RIGHT AFTER me and sophie broke up. so theyd go out on dates, and simone would HAVE TO come along too, so instead of it being three people, id go too as a friend of isaac and simone and klarissa, not as a boyfriedn to simone. then i started hearing that simone REALLY liked me (which now wasnt exactly true... so she realized). and i was like "thats cool, shes cute, shes nice, i just dont want a girlfriend." so i DID liek her, and i THOUGHT i really liked her, but i dont kno if i really did. it was as if people were forcing me to like her. all of her friends that i talked to would tell me how much she liked me, and how we should go out. but the thing was i ALWAYS felt like there was somthing preventing me from getting with ehr, and i kept saying that it was causei had just gotten out of a relationship... but its been FIVE FUCKING MONTHS! that cant be the reason.   so i realize now that it wasnt me, it was her. it was like i was telling meself that i liked her, but my heart wouldnt let me commit.... and in actuality, (i think, in my heart) i was looking for a reason to stop talknig to her... tho i didnt realize it consiously.  soooooo... gabe came ( rita calls him satan) along, and simone TOTALLY played my face... shes the only one that thinks im wrong in this... but its fine now, i dont have and feelings towards that now. but yeah, soooo.... me and simone fell apart cause i felt sort of betrayed, and really upset... and basically most people were like, ummm... forget her, ok? and id be like, "ok, ill try"  LIKE EVERYONE  so i did talk to her about it, and she just kept saying how wrong i was and stuff, and how everyon was wrong... not her. so it was whatever after that. and through this whole time, i was telling phylicia everything i felt, and she was always there for me. she tried to help and everything, but she didnt wanna get into it too much. so she was the one girl that i was able to talk to.. through everything.  so i started to realize that phylicia was the one that i really should have eben with in the first place... it was like these feelings that were  different  . they werent the same things i felt with simone OR sophie. it was this feeling of completness. so i realized that she was the one... not anybody else.  and so it wasnt like i had met her through simone or anything.. in fact, they became better friedns because of me. im the one who gave simone phylicia's screen name... so it wasnt like i met one of simones freinds, and then went behind her back and went out with her. it was like, they were two people i met differently, i didnt even knew they knew each other when i was talking to them at first. so yeah...  now me and phylicia go out... and its GREAT, i love her. its like all those feelings of... "i dont want another girlfriend" were gone. so we started dating a little while back... and im really happy... i do get to see her.. and i might be going to jordan next year too. hopefully drama wont continue there, but whatever.  soooo nowwwwwwwwwww people think that me and phylicia were a secret. WE WERENT. we were just waitng for simone to get home so that WE COULD TELL HER and not other people (ie Klarissa) it wasant that we didnt want her to know cause i think im in the wrong... STOP FUCKING ASSUMING THINGS PEOPLE! Simone should know not to assume better than ANYBODY! you were soooooooooooooooooooooo mad that i assumed and said i shouldnt, so dont do it yourself, just ask me like you wanted me to do...  anyway, there was no secret... I just wanted to tell people myself, but i guess that didnt work cause of isaacs dumb ass (lol) and some other people who talk too much... but its ok now, just dont be mad, theres nothing to be mad about.... im with phylicia... im not that important... so dont be mad... period.       sooo anyway... just know that there were no secrets... there was no "hidden relationship" at all... it was just that i didnt want people tryna tell my business when i can do it myself. so yeah... ill add more if there is more confusion       SO STOP BEING SO DAMN NOSEY!!!!!!!
