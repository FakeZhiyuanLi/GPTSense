      I gust got done swimming with my ultimate friend Courtny. We had an awsome time. Her Nana and papaw r here from Winter Springs, Fl, soe their comming with us. She is also comming to our cookout tomorrow. I think I broke up with Micah, I'm not sure. we are in this huge fight over trust. Appareltny he can't trust me. But it's soe male typical that I have to trust him, but he cant trust me, like i'n some sort of hore that chaeats on people. I swear i feel Like im gonna cry becuase i realy doe like him, but I mean if he can't trust me, then whats the point? I dount knoe. Im gust trying to escape it all. I even told myslef that i wouldnt cry, but soe far i dount have that much will power. Gust like I have no will power to diet, I swear I'm getting soe fat but what the hell? we all die neway, might as well be happy and full, then skinny and hungry. All thou when u die ur really not either. And one question has really been bugging me,. A thought really.:  Are people in society really as stupid as they are obese? I mean are they not seeing the the harm their doing to this planet? Im not some tree loviong freak, butreally. are Americans are soe ignorant that they cannot see that cars, trains, and tother pollution is making the ozone layer evaporate, which is causing the atmosphere to disapate? Really, everyone is always talking abou this generation, well what about the next one? They are the tru victomas that have to deal with our poor judgement. They may have better tachnology, but its not going to brig back the Ozone Layer, soe why try to improve something that is going to be pointless in about 200 years?This shows how todays society is truley only thinking about themselves.Also, with the Ozone Layer being depleted, this means that the Ice Caps are melting at a rapid rate. If something doesnt happen soon. The state of California is going to be totally under water. Really, if a thirteen year old can figure something this complex out, why can't a forty year old scientist?

      I'm really hungery becuase I am too lazy to go and get my food. we are having steaks, thogu I wish we were having round steak w/ mushroom sause. YUM! I'm trying to get virginia to go cold chicken on the anime kick shes on. So far, not soe good. I knoe its cold turkey, but cold chicken sounds way cooler. My hair straightner broke and soe i have to goe get a new one. I paid freekin 40 bucks for it and ill be damned if I'm gonna use a broke straightner. You better believe that that company whos name shall remain nameless for protection, will be getting, an angry, threating, unsatisfactory letter from me. Soe shall it be written soe shall it be done!

      I gust got back from Culver In, With my friend Virginia. It was soe awsome! I went tubing with her and wer did soe much. I got road rashy on my elbows because of the tube but it was worth it. Virginia fell 3 times in a row, but Most the time it wasn't her fault. We hit this huge wave and When we landed I was on my knees and she was in the water. We also watched the Culver Academy parade. it is the Military prep school. It looked like a neat place to goe.&nbsp; Virginia atempted to get a fish off a hook (By the way, she didn't even catch the fish) But I got two pics of it. Well I'm really tired soe I'm going to sleep. Later.

      This Soceity is really one big Hypocyt. As a maater of fact, I think it is the BIGGEST type of hypocrct. Every where you go, you see billboreds, signs, and articals in the paper aboutchildren getting into trouble. What doe they expect? There isn't anywhere in Kokomo for kids to go unless thwey get in trouble, or have to pay all of their allowence, or sitting doing nothing and being bored. They are also retard and are oblivious to the fact that they are hurting this inviroment soe much that they're really not giving, any future generation that much of a chance.  Guess thats all I hafta say except for, they need to get those Dickheads who dount knoe what thwe hell they're doing in the whitehouse outa there.

      Well, this weekend hasn't been really intertaining. I went to my Mamaw and Papaw's for our 4th of July Cook-out. Nothing thrilling. I gust heard from Virgina that my friend kyle, and his family were in a car accident, which is pretty awful. luckly No one was hurt.  feel really bad for them, though. I've been feeling really weird lately. Like, no emotion. like I'm usually hyper and talkitive, but I've been quiet and to myslef, I'm not depressed or anything. I gust feel real sdiffrent. I hope I get over it soon. I hate it. well later.

That was a first.  ok after school I was going to my g-mas w/ my mom and we stopped at this stop light and there was a HOTT HOTT HOTT 16 or 17 yr old bside us and i glanced over and he was looking at me, but i went on talking, and my moms like "he was checking you out. . . .UR TOO YOUNG TO BE SCHECKED OUT!" Vierginia thinks its cause I wore this pink tank top and a shirt over it, and my hair dow. W/e. Anyway she left me to get a cd. *Sniff Sniif* how dare she leave me. lol anyway she is usually quite funny, it was gust yesterday she didnt put forth much effort.

      Today was a total waste of make up. I was soe sleepy in school, I fell asleep in Mrs. Stoltfutz's class. She was pretty ticked but screw her. Im not their to shover my haed up their ass. I was really hyper this mourning. I had my own ashlee Simpson concert, inm wich I balireds the music for my family to rant an rave at me. yet again I'm not here to please them. Virginia wasn't hyper, which totally threw me off cause in Choir I was funny, and all she would doe was laugh, she never helped me out. Oh well. Im soe tired, and I want my mom to french braid my hair but i higly doubt that is gonna happen. L8er

And I'm prectally high on nyquil and pepto (Although Im not sure why my mom gave me Nyquil concidering its daytime, and the dayquil qwas right next to it.) God that pepto was horrible!
