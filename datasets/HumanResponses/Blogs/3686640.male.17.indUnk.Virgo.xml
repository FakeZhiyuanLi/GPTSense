      Well I didn't know Google owns Blogger and since it does, Blogger can't be bad, can it? So here I am.

      I've been very intrigued with group psychology lately. Here's an interesting  urlLink article . I haven't got the time to finish reading it but it has some pretty uh interesting points so far.  Is it me or are there too little synonyms for the word "interesting"?

      If there's anything worse than lawyers and politicians, it's telemarketers. Don't you hate it when you get a phone call at your most unsuspecting moments from some stranger with a funny accent who starts off by asking you a seemingly innocent question such as "Do you fill forms for lucky draws at cinemas?"  No. Go away. You just wasted 20 seconds of my life that I can never get back and I'm paying for those goddamn 20 seconds too. Wouldn't it be nice if these hellspawns introduce themselves as telemarketers right from the start so I can bring my phone to the closest device that induces painful static noises?  Well if anyone's interested in doing prank calls... 67336465.

      I'm done. I didn't choose any of the  Tarantino sound clips  though 'cause&nbsp;my mind gets all nostalgic and I have the entire movie played out in my head instead of getting new ideas. Also, I think I'll pretty much  hate  whatever sound clip I used after hearing it for a  gazillion times  for this assignment. So, the story plot is.. well I could sum it up in a few words:  clich√© samurai swordfight.   &nbsp;  Uh-oh not much time left for  Quest for Glory . I'll end off just like this.   P.S.  B o l d i n g  k e y w o r d s  is  stupid .

      Fun fact: Did you know that listening to crappy music makes me  sneeze ?  &nbsp;  Well I'm sneezing a lot right now, listening to the many sound samples we get to choose from for our  animation project . So far I really liked the  Pulp Fiction  clip and another one I believe I heard from  Kill Bill . No big surprise that all the Tarantino clips got chosen as a) I'm a huge fan of both movies and b) Q. Tarantino knows how to choose his soundtrack. The rest of the sound clips are for the tone deaf.. mostly. There's one that's reminiscent of that MCBombfunk mix. I think I know who's gonna choose that one.  &nbsp;  Oh yeah I forgot. Big news! I'm doing my  homework ! And if anyone's wondering why I'm bolding certain words, it's because I learnt in Interactive Web Design class that it helps people with  really short attention spans  to read stuff, namely everyone on the internet.  &nbsp;  About that last entry, I don't mean everyone. Darrell is still cool even though he's like, playing neopets now.&nbsp;When I say " now ", I mean possibly right now. He's that obsessed. Wants to buy this white paintbrush thingamajig. I think it's cruel how you  splash paint over your cute weird pets  but this is coming from a person who hasn't fed his neopets for  months . I hope the paint isn't  lead-based  or they may very well turn out to be like Darrell!  &nbsp;  Oh, oh yeah, I am supposed to be getting some work done before I play  Quest for Glory V  again. Alright back to sneezy crappy music listening.

      Haha Praseeda's been bugging me to blog (blog? blog-ize? blogerise? blogerinafurgamise?) , so here it goes! &nbsp; I guess I'll say something about the new semester since I've not really uh done that. I wish this semester could be better. It sucks. I thought it'd be fun with all those opportunities to do programming geeky stuff but no, it's BOORING with much stress on the 'O'. I don't know what it is with everyone. It seems that everyone changed after the June holidays.. or is it just me? It's like that episode in Buffy where.. well the one where everyone changes. &nbsp; I've ran out of stuff to say. The conversation well is drained dry and I'm steering clear of a lot of people just to avoid awkward moments. If anyone I snubbed is reading this, I'm sorry. Or maybe I'm not and I hate you. No one cares enough to ask anyway. I'll just be sitting in that corner with my sanity intact thank you very much. &nbsp; I'm just so sick of everything. Why am I the only one trying not to gag when someone says something totally crass and unfunny? The same old jokes have been done so many time it borders on lobotomy. People are so dull. I have more fun talking to a rock. Not that I've experimented since it's totally uncool that Terence is doing that already. &nbsp; I don't know how any of these is gonna work out. I don't really think it will. I hate my life now.

      Time: 1.27am Status: No freaking sleeping yet  I know I'm gonna be so wasted tomorrow. I'll be walking into people, nodding off in class. I just created a quiz and I messed up 2 of the questions. The correct answers for "How many sisters do I have?" and "What do I not mind eating for the rest of my life?" are 2 and "Eating is a waste of time." respectively. Don't question the integrity of those answers. Weird as they are, they're true. I'm kinda worried for messing up though.. what if everyone thinks I have only one sister now and this causes some paradigm shift in time and reality, resulting me in having only one sister? Or worse! I could end up having 2 noses and a world without internet access!  Stop thinking, brain. Must sleep.

      I am tired as heck right now. I had a long day dealing with that showcase thing yesterday and I had school from 9 to 6 today. AND it's the same hectic schedule tomorrow. 9 to 6. Oh joy.  Argh damn, I hate how I have this natural knack of shooting off my mouth. Praseeda got me in an MSN conversation with her friend from HK and I killed the conversation with the first thing I said. Bad Benjamin! *slaps forehead*  It's been a while since we have a Erencetay update, hasn't it? Well today T, and T because he might be reading this, did something totally unflattering to himself and I think he got the attention of everyone in the lecture theatre.  He flashed a  nipple .  Heheh not really but he very well might have! Adding on to his list of publicity stunts, he climbed over the rows of seats to get to the exit of the lecture hall. Why am I not even shocked anymore? I'm just numb to this insanity! Heheh it'd be pretty funny if everyone halt in their tracks and look at him wide-eyed.  Oh and he was totally scoping Narmeet's ass yesterday morning, along with J-for-Jerry! Get a restraining order against T, Narmeet. Of course unless you enjoy that kinda attention lol.  Gabriel christianed Mr Ho "Hooker Hong" which has a nice tang to it. Heheh of ALL people, Gabriel!  Well that's it. I still feel really bad about that slip of tongue just now. Must shut up.

      "i woke up at 10, i feel like a truck hit me then grind my bones to dust by moving repeatedly over my limp paralysed body"  Maybe I shouldn't sleep at 1 am again. It's been raining a lot lately and I know because I usually have a cold coming before it rains.  On a totally unrelated note, when will I finish my blog template?

       urlLink Memegen 4.0   Jesus on a stick! A quiz generator! I could spend hours on this site finding out who will give me an orgasm, what my funeral will be like or who's my celebrity family (my mom's Celine Dion wtf)!  I created a quiz myself. Here's the results I got:       What is your alignment? (Planescape Torment) by zxzxlch      Horoscope           Gender      Male Female I don't know..       Birthdate (DDMMYYYY)           Your Alignment    Chaotic Neutral :: Chaotic neutral charaters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparant purpose gamble everything they have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.        Alignment Level: 92%                                                                                             Created with the ORIGINAL  urlLink  MemeGen  !

      Ahem.   Fish Monkey Flip Flops   ...because this is a blog and I can get away with saying something utterly random and unfunny! Hah!  It's the first day of school today and as I was about to go to sleep (at 1am this morning), I lay on my bed looking at the ceiling thinking of all the great things that could happen the next day. Maybe I'll save the president from some 50 feet monster with really bad breath (not that I have this great desire to save the president.. I'll save him then dump him in a ditch or something. Gah! Treason!) Maybe I'll do some major filing. Maybe I'll create the web comic I've always set my mind to! Maybe I'll finish this blog's template.  Oh then I woke up at 6 thirty this morning. And I went back to sleep.  In my defense, it's probably because something in my dream is of Great Importance, like saving a dream-president or battling a hugeass hourglass or something. Well, I got up eventually and dragged my dead limp body to the bathroom.  And there in the bathroom, I thought about what I did the day before to deserve such a splitting headache. That's when I remembered all these stuff and thought, "Maybe I should blog this down. Oh and firefox rules and I should update my msn nick to reflect that." And that I did!  I'd better get ready for school now. Hmmm can't decide whether to wear the President Saving Gear or the Hugeass Anime Monster Battling Magical Suit.  (I'm gonna look at this entry some 5 years later, read this, can't make any sense out of it and resist the tempation to delete this entry)

      Zorpia sold out. Yeah. That sucked. Let's pretend I mouthed off something really witty instead of those few syllabaes. I just can't write anything knowing that somebody else but me is gonna be reading this. Sometimes I somehow trick myself into thinking I'm writing a private entry. Please don't look at me like that.  Heheh I think I'll read this someday and feel really stupid. I write stupid stuff. Makes me feel stupid. DUUURRRRHHH!!!!11 BRAAAAINS! YUM YUM YUM!

      Pffft so unmotivated right now. At least, I've started working on my assignments. Right now, what I wanna do most is sleep. Not quite like "rest", more like just lying on my bed and staring into space.  I just skimmed through my blog and reeled in horror at all that angst and brooding! It turns out that I've NEVER written a single entry when I'm feeling alright-ish, only when I'm right down in the pits of depression (note the rich metaphor used.. creative like teenage angst-y poetry!)!  So.. I guess I need to write happy entries too. People are already thinking I'm insane or something I bet. Well.. probably, thanks to sleeping at 3am in the morning. My biological clock's gone wonky. So anyway, happy entries. Maybe I'll just plague this blog by inserting smileys after every line! =) =) See? Much happier already! =D  Bleh I think I'd better get back to work. =O

      Everyday I wake up, I feel a little worse than before. Why, it wouldn't be long before I need an "eject" button at the side of my bed to get out of it. No more sleeping at 3.

      I just remember I wanna write an entry bout how much I detest and fear nice people but I'll write that when I get some much needed sleep. I might be experiencing sleep-deprived induced insanity. Might explain the horrible grammar.

      I guess not many people reads this blog (I hope) so I'll just vent. It's about Mattina and Corey, I feel like they're so distant now.. almost like strangers. Even though I really should be discussing this with them instead of whining a la live-jounal, I don't have the guts to. Because maybe they hate me or something but they're not telling me. There's a lot I feel that they're not telling me. Like, "Benjamin, I hate that hair" or "Benjamin stop it with that goofy attitude" or "Just shut the hell up". I don't know, I'm paranoid like this.  Ever had one of those moments where there's this uncomfortable silence? Well I get a lot of those. I just don't know what to say. I'm always getting ho-hum reactions from both of them. And what the fuck, I don't get their stupid jokes.  Ok getting dangerously pissed now. I think I'd better stop before this erupts into a full essay into insulting every single person I know. No wait, there's just so much more I gotta vent before I get a brain eneurysm. As if my relationship with both of them isn't strained enough, I'm in this partnership with them for some making-portfolios-for-model-wannabes thing. We want to start a company, "we" being Corey. Actually I'm already in Web-Whizz and I'm happy there. My cousin Derek has more determination and guts than both of them combined. I went through the beginning of Web-Whizz and I didn't think it would work at first. Well it wouldn't if not for all the work Derek put into it. Corey really wants to do this, yes, but he doesn't have the makings of a business person.  First off (I really want to get this off my chest), he's always late. Secondly, he's so freaking unreasonable that it's not even funny! He could push an old lady into traffic (hypothetically speaking) and somehow come to the conclusion that he's right. I think I've failed my duty as a friend by not putting him in his place but it's pretty fucking tiresome when that guy can argue for hours, somehow conveniently ignoring your points or misintepreting them. Oh I give up. I hope he doesn't see this or I'll have no end of it.  It's tragic that we're already pretty deep in this business shit. Corey got approval from SP to use the video studio thingy. We've already sketched out the design for the website. I really don't want to do this but it seems that it means so much to him. Hell, just when I was about to tell him I quit, he told me that this means a lot to him and if it doesn't work out, he'll END IT ALL or something. Somewhere along those lines. So I never got around to telling him "Fuck you anyway, I quit."  Maybe I should have because I don't see this working out. I've got assignments to rush, I need my spare time to sleep. So unless I have the ability to transcend time and space, I don't see this working out anytime ever.  Anyone who's reading this, please give me some much needed advice, I'd appreciate that very much.

      10.14pm now. Just woke up and finished my dinner. Feel  woozy .  Should've known better than to nap again. Napping gives me bad dreams... worse dreams than what I usually have. I woke up with the tune of Malcolm Mclaren's "About Her" in my head. There's this time I woke up with the Balamb Garden tune in my head. Oh well.  The dream goes like this: I'm like, in a  Resident Evil  game except it's in a construction site setting and those  zombies  are charging at me at some ungodly speed. So I ran and fire at them with my handgun at the same time. But crap, my weapons have a slow reload speed so I switched to my shotgun (did I pull it out of my pants or what? Wait, that turned out wrong). As I reached the other end of the construction site, I'm suddenly the  combined consciousness of Sasuke, Naruto and some other ninja guy  (whom I shall name Ninja Guy).  The zombies are still hanging around there though. So there's this voice telling Sasuke to kill Naruto and Sasuke charges up his  Chidori . Pretty cool, I'm looking from his perspective. Sasuke rushes at Naruto, chidori in hand while Naruto summons his... frog. As they meet, the chidori ball sorta shrinks and floats away taking Naruto's and Ninja Guy's souls with it. Both of them retards pretend nothing happen even though the searing pain where their soul used to be had to be pretty damn obvious.  Then Naruto and Ninja Guy hops onto the back of a pickup truck with the rest of the zombies. Fin.  Well I certainly hope this dream doesn't say anything bout my  state of mind ... pretty  tripping  huh.

       urlLink    That's for the DEUI project. I'm tired as heck. Can't think of anything to blog. I like a lot of songs from the  urlLink Kill Bill  Volume 2 soundtrack. I don't like MRTs. I like buses. I dislike the apostrophe key. I keep hitting "Return" by accident. I like 2D games. I like 3D games but not so much. I'm old school. I like videogamerecaps.com. I like web comics.  urlLink Sluggy Freelance . I like  urlLink Wigu  and  urlLink Sam and Fuzzy  too.  I like  ranting .  urlLink
