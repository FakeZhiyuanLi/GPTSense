       [Ignore Timestamp]  I do believe the weekends over and what a stonned one it was too. I knew this was going to be a weekend to remember a while back. It was the weekend of my cousins marraige in norway, the one which my elders were invited to, and due to  unfortumate  circumstances I had to stay at home with my siblings. "What a disapointment" I exclaimed to my mothers as she reveled the  bad  news to me.  This was some months before and I proceded to get the arrangments in place for everything to flow on the night. I meet with friends and explained the situation, and told them it was only open to those with vocal invite. So now my usual crowd where coming and there was still room for more. I enthusasticly phoned around and invited more 'less seen' friends.  By now there it was already looking towards being a party to remember. And we hadn't even discussed the gear that was going to be passed around. Of the 15 that I invited, 8 [including me] where to chip in together, 4 wanted there own through me, and the other 3 where bringing along the own shiznic.   To Be Continued

       I'm all alone in my house tonight... I'm planning to get round to doing one of the many projects I have stuck in my head. I might start work on the weed community forum Highgrounds that I've been planning to do for ages. Or I could finally sort out my music collection and tag all the songs properly, so I can put them on CD's. But more then likely I'll go watch ' urlLink Fight Club ' and once again spend a night sat doing sweet fuck all.  N2S [Note 2 Self]: Compulsory revision tomorrow... Don't lie to yourself.

       This is my first post of what will hopefully be many. I was contemplating writing a blog for about 2 weeks but I fiqured I ain't got anything to lose. I plan on writing about anything thats of interest to me and somethings that don't. This blogs really just for me to keep a record of anything interesting but its free to read by others so if your here now you might as well read on. Generally i'll be going on about websites if checked out, music i've heard, games i've played and some non-specific bullshit. There isn't much else to say on the subject...
