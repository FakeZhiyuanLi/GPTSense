        Ok yall if you havent heard that song you most deffinately need too!!!  it is the most amazing song and has so many questions.. that we cant anwser, but we can change!  It says:  If we are the body,  Why arent his arms reachin?  Why arent his hands healin?  Why arent his words teachin?  And if we are the body,  Why arent his feet going,  Why is his love not showing them there is a way?  There is a way!  Jesus paid much to high in price,  For us To pick and choose in choose who should come.  And we are the body of Christ!!!!!      I cant even type anymore, just try to anwser that for me!!!

O well.. i mean aghh.. i know they are here to make our lives better.. but tell me if its just me, but it seems like its to make it worse .. adn more stressful!!!  Grrr it makes me so mad!  Atleast my phone wastn taken this time.. lol.. anywho.. now that i got that out!!  Ok well yesterday was my team that i coach.. vball tourney.. and we got secong place!  *woot woot*  But hey you know what makes me mad, is that it is an all gurls southlake vball league... and guess what there was a guy on this team who was the whole team!!!  He was the only one who could overhand.. adn cream it on the poor lil gurls, it made me so mad!  If he wasnt there we could have beat them !!!  And gottten first!!  But hey o well thats ok.. atleast its not my team, i would have been ticked out the wahzoo.. and yall know i would have! LoL            Ok well today i was cleanin my room and stuff and my closet.. since i was grounded to my room(technically i should be there now).. and i found all my pictures adn old year books and stuff and took a moment to look back at all of them.. and Omgosh .. it brought back so many memories!  Good timez and bad!  And then i looked at all my notes from the year.. (i am still doing that now.. if all yall remember my note pocket)  and like omgosh i was reading all the fights and tears and happiness in those notes and it made me think about all the things that happened this year and if they should have happened or.. if we should have prevented them!  Especially me and RAEGANS fights.. omg babe those are hilarious..I LOVE YOU TO DEATH!

        OMGOSH!  School has been so amazing this year in so many ways.  I dunno what i would have done without all my friends there with me.  All of our inside jokes.. our annoying the teachers... not doing our homework till the last minute. LOL !!  Always a blast.  Next year is going to kick butt in highschool!!  I cant wait!!    But don't get me wrong, there are some things this year that i wish i could have or would have done.  So many regrets that go along with this year.  It wasn't all fun and games, believe me!       - I wish i just could have told you how i really felt.    - I wish i wouldn't have blown off so many people as much as i did!     - I wish i would h have tried harder to be who I am and not just like everyone else.    - I wish i wouldn't have made the many mistakes i did, or i wish i could have said I'm sorry so many  more times, or no have treated people like i did.    But you know there are so many good things that i am glad i did this year.. doing things i never thought i would see myself doing 2 years ago!     - Gettin to know people that are so AWESOME!    - Going to faith, even though i know many of you don't like it. (Much better then public, i swear)    - Getting to grow so much more in my faith, and change my bad ways, or atleast try!    - Gettin the guts to be able to talk about 7th grade in front of highskool at chapel!!    School was amazing this year!  Even though we went through our ups and downs!  Next year is going to be so amazing, and i wish to see everyone of you back there!!!  Yall are amazing!  Thanks for making my life so much better!    But yall seriously, what are yall doing sittin at the computer?  it summmer!  get out and have some fun!!!!!  Like normal teenagers do!!  SuMmeR 2004!

         Why does she have to hurt me so bad?  Why does she say i am the friend shes never had!  She told me that she would be there whenever i need her!  Ya right!! Thats a lie!  I try to call her.. but no.. she always has to be busy.. and cant talk to me, but i can call back 5 min later and she will be talking to someone else!    I just need her the most right now, and she is the only one that understands that i can talk to!  But no.. she has to ditch me like she always does!  But then when she needs someone the most.. who does she come crawling to... who listens to her everyword.. who gives her advice on what to do?  And what do i get back in return???... NOTHING!!  It sucks.. but you no what i have to move on .. but still its hard!!!!  I need to have her to talk to .. but obviously.. she isnt there!

           Poem 1     I hate you right now But still love you somehow It’s hard to explain When you cant feel my pain.     When I look back on us All I see is happiness It’s been so long For it to all be gone.     She came along And now you’re gone She took you away You left so soon all in one day.     Now I sit screaming Wishing I was dreaming All I can do is cry Wishing I could die.    I want things like they used to be When it was just you and me We were best friends Forever till the end.      poem 2           Think of all the times I was there And how I've always showed I care  Think of all the good days we had And all the great days we shared  Remember I wiped tears from your eyes And how I listened to your sighs  When people blamed you, I took your side I never let my feelings hide  As a friend, I've always been true Always helped, and looked out for you  In the end this is what I get You're with someone else, starting to forget  All the things I have done How close we were, and all the fun      Friends are hard to deal with!  Especially the best ones who arent there when you need them most!!  I have been there for her through thick and thin, and when i need her most Shes on the phone with someone else.. i told her its serious.. she said shed have to call me back!  Yall i hate when friends just ditch you when u need them most!!!  It sucks!!  I dunno if its just me or if any of yall have felt this way but it really sucks!!!  I thought i new her .. but i guess not !  It seems she only talks to me.. when she needs help.. not when i need to talk!!!  I dunno what to do i wanna talk to her but i dunno what to say!!!  I dont even think she relizes that i am writing this about her.. but i wish she did!!!!!
