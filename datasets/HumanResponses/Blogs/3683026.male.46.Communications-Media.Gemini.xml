						   Well, coming back from a recent outside uplink yesterday, we got a taste of what's going on in this place.  When our security team picked us up exiting the Green Zone yesterday, we had a red SUV force it's way into our 3 vehicle convoy.  The SUV had 4 "dodgey" looking blokes in it that were doing everything they could to get alongside the SNG truck.  Due to traffic, they couldn't!  The good news was, the second vehicle of our security detail was right on their tail.  If anything did happen, they would have smoked the bad guys.  Because our security company shares information with other security companies, we found out later that this particular vehicle, a red SUV with German plates with the smaller Iraqi plates on top of the German ones, has been spotted on numourous ocassions shadowing contractor and news vehicles.  It's just one of those things that we have to watch out for while we are traveling around over here.  So far we have been lucky here at Fox News but, "incidents" are expected to increase over the next week as it gets closer to the handover of power to the Iraqi government.  It's good that I don't have to go out much but, when I do go out, it's like drinking a lot of coffee, you are soooo alert!!  Well, that's it for now.  Later!!

						   Hi all!!  Well, here I am in the lovely, ancient city of Baghdad!  I've got a gig here with FOX NEWS.  We're at the Sheraton Hotel, which is across the street from the famous Palestine Hotel!  That's the hotel where all the press was that got hit during the war with a lot of ground fire.  Three Journalists were killed in that.  KBR, the big American contractor, has built a compound around both the Palestine and Sheraton Hotels.  It's complete with large concrete blast walls, armed Ghurka guards, and a contingent of US military guys that also use the Sheraton (the taller of the 2 hotels) as a military observation post (they have an awful lot of weapons for "observing").  KBR has a lot of their employees in the two hotels so, wants them to be as safe as possible when their relaxing and sleeping!  Anyway, so far things are fine with us here.  We have car bombs going off about every other day around the city.  The last one killed about 35 Iraqis!  The same day we had a rocket attack on the hotel compound!  Two 122mm rockets came in and made a lot of noise but, only minor damage.  The news in that was, it confirmed the hotels as a legitimate target for the insurgents!  It's not enough that they target the contractor vehicles with their suicide bombers, they also want to kill us as we're sleeping!!  The good news in all of this is that, I don't have to leave the hotel very much.  My job requires me to be in the room that we call the MCR (master control room) most of the day (and night).  The only time I have to go out is when we have to use the mobile uplink kit, or what we call the SNG (Satellite News Gathering).  Speaking of which, we have to take it out tomorrow to bring over to the CPA (Coalition Provisional Authority) to cover the preliminary hearings on the court martial of the soldiers who "abused" the prisoners at the infamous Al Gharib Prison.  Hopefully, that will prove to be pretty boring (i.e. no bombings in our area).  After that, I'll still have a little over 3 weeks left (with FOX NEWS).  Then it's back home to start sorting out a possible big business deal for my fledgling company, Pacific Frontier Communications, Inc.  I hope it will be the type of business that will generate enough revenue that will keep me home most of the time.  I feel confident that it will but, I won't fool myself into thinking it will be easy!  Well, that's it for my first "Blog"!  I'll write again soon.  Cheers

						    From an email dated July 5, 2004:   Hi everybody,  As most of you know from watching the news, last Friday, July 2, 2004, both the Sheraton and Baghdad Hotels, here in Baghdad, Iraq, were attacked with rockets by the insurgents/terrorists.  For the Sheraton Hotel, they had created a 17 tube launcher and mounted in the back of a minibus.  For the Baghdad hotel, they had created an 18 tube launcher and mounted it crosswise on the roof of a 4-door pickup truck.  All in all, quite a lot of firepower.  The only thing that saved us from a lot of grief and cleaning up was the fact that the insurgents/terrorists are not the most educated people in the world.  At the Sheraton Hotel (where I stay), the mini-bus parked across the square, with the back end facing toward the hotel, a little before sunrise.  The driver got out and opened the back doors and walked away.  At approx. 7:30 in the morning, the first rocket was launched remotely and streaked toward the hotel.  As it left the launcher, it broke the welds of the launchers legs holding the assembly in place inside the mini-bus and knocked the launcher a little toward the side.  Then, 2 more rockets launched out of the mini-bus.  While the first rocket impacted on the 10th floor, the next 2 rockets took off in a slightly different direction and streaked between the Sheraton and Palestine Hotels, crossing the river and landing in the "secure" Green Zone.  It was at about this time, that the fire, started from the exhaust from the rockets, really took hold inside the mini-bus.  The fire caused the rest of the rockets to misfire as the launching mechanism was consumed in the blaze.  Consequently, only 3 of the 17 rockets ever made it out of the launchers.  The attached picture was taken from the balcony of my room, overlooking the square.  At the Baghdad Hotel, the vehicle parked down the street, crosswise to the hotel.  The driver got out, removed the canvas cover over the rocket launchers and walked away.  At approx. 7:30 in the morning, the first rocket was launched toward the hotel.  The kick from the launch had the undesirable effect of rocking the truck toward it's side causing the truck to tip over.  This resulted in the rocket making a high arc in the air toward the Hotel but, only able to reach the car park.  One car destroyed, two damaged and 3 people injured, one badly.  So far, our only defense against these insurgents/terrorists is their own ignorance.  How long will that last???  Well, for those that don't know, my room was on the 5th floor of the hotel.  The impact on the hotel happened while I was in the shower.  There was a loud roar and then the building gave a shudder.  I didn't know what happened until I stepped out of the shower, looked out the window of my room and saw the mini-bus rocket launcher on fire.  That's when I snapped the pic.  Hope you like it.  Take care and I'll see you all soon.
