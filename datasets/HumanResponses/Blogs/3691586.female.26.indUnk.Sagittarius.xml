      i'm totally zapppeedd! got back from singapore early this morning at about 3am then had a short nap before dragging my shell to work. well.. not entirely an empty shell, my brain actually function for today! :oP i must be getting used to my past whole week of insomnia already...  someone told me that singapore sales is the same as malaysia sales. boy oh boy, were they wrong!! its a shopping haven! especially if i were earning singapore dollars... loved the jewellery choices and designs there but prefer the shoes selection here back in KL.   as for sight seeing... i went to the 71st floor of swiss hotel to get a bird's eye view of part of singapore and saw esplanade (a singaporean friend called it the durian :oP). i wanted to go for night safari but it was raining so.. sigh.. couldn't get to see the eyes in the darkness.  oh yeah, i had this really delicious and yummy dumplings at 'din tai fung' restaurant at paragorn mall (orchard road)! also, i tried mos burger for the first time n its not too bad. they had this strawberry dessert which was cold and part of the inside was filled with white chocolate and cream or something which i think was pretty different and unique. oh! and there's this place called the bakers inn at paragorn mall as well that serves pretty good italian food and yuuummmmyyy mouth watering dessert!  a bigggg thank you to ah boy for driving us to singapore, wk for being our tour guide and also mgk lee for keeping me company to do aimless shopping :oP  -Smile and the world smiles with u!!-   in reply to esurl's comments on 21 june 2004  thanks for reading my blog! am glad u find it interesting :o) thanks for ur comments and ur view points.. i really appreciate the time u took to write it.  i won't be taking up the offer with sia. altho, it's a waste, i won't regret my decision cos i believe that for every opportunity missed, it will be compensated. plus, why dwell over things that couldn't happen. its better to look forward to things that will happen :o)  as for my boss's offer, i'm not really particular whether the holiday is paid or unpaid. altho my boss gave me a month off, i'm only going to take 2 weeks off to go UK. as for ur advise on not being too comfortable with my job, i'm really interested to hear more on it. after all, u have been through that experience :o)  'gusto' is in damansara perdana (exit from sprint highway headed to kepong, right after mutiara damansara exit), at the shopping mall (i think the mall's name is tropics). u can see it from the main street. i was there with a couple of friends (i'm not married, no boyfriend and it was not a date). i guess its a perfect place to bring ur date cos its pretty cozy and quiet. not sure about the wine selection tho.. cos i dun drink wine :oP and my friends were good company :o)

      Happy Belated Birthday Nik!!! hope he got my sms yesterday. i did remember!!  has been a busy past two days at work... but work's good. been a while since i've been that busy :oP hehehe..  yesterday, during my coffee session at a supposedly nice area but deeply infested with mosquitos from midnite onwards, i was surprised that there was a rat running around! and my friend accidentally caught it with her foot! 'eeugghh' she was traumatised for at least half an hour! but luckily the rat wasn't the size of a cat like at most mamak stalls.  i'm looking forward to this weekend! am headed to singapore for a getaway! yippeee! haven't been to singapore since i was a little girl and had to travel on my parent's passport :oP heh... which reminds me i gotta go look for my passport. i wonder how singapore has changed since then? but anyway...singapore sales here i come!!! :o)

      its been a super busy day at work!! i'm actually serving my resignation notice... and was planning to fly away with sia at the end of july but due to circumstances i cannot control, i have to forgo the glamourous air stewardess job! :o( so, to compensate, i was planning to bum around and travel for a couple of months but today my boss asked me to stay with promises that my job scope will improve in future and an extra perk of 1 month holiday! unpaid of course :oP i thought i would be doing a lot of thinking about his offer, but at the moment i think nothing else beats it. i'm comfortable where i am. plus its not easy finding a company and a boss that treats u nice. thankfully, i am in one!  went for dinner at this place called 'gusto' in damansara perdana. its pretty cozy. good place to sit down for a nice quiet dinner and chat. its italian food is not too bad and some of the drinks are pretty interesting. perfect place to bring your date to :oP

      life's funny sometimes... sometimes we do things we least expect to.. and sometimes we don't do anything at all..  i never thought i would be writing a blog.. but a friend of mine convinced me that it would be a fun experience.. something like writing a diary.. which i haven't done in ages :oP i was looking back at my old diaries the other day and it was such fun to read and recall things that happen. the sad and happy moments.. as well as moments i never thought could happen to me but i got through it! since we are now in the cyber/technology age, i guess its time to update myself and write a blog to record my points in life :o) perhaps one day, my future generation would look back at my little points in life and enjoy a laughter or a tear and my thoughts to remember me by...  yesterday i was reminded of how easily women are crushed by the emotion of love/crush/admiration etc.. guys also go through this phase but generally, i think women take it harder as they are much more emotionally dependent compared to the male species. but the maturity of dealing with the hurt or pain really does come with age and experience... looking at the young gal yesterday, i really feel sorry that she takes it so hard upon herself. i hope that in time, she will learn the positive points from this experience and grow to be a mature and beautiful person.  life's too short to be frowning all the time so put on a million dollar smile to keep urself and other people around u happy... :o)

      i successfully manage to review 2 tax computations, get it signed and sent it to the tax agent by yesterday afternoon...yippeeee!! total relief... but 1 more tax computation to go... the deadline is 10 august.. so there is a bit more time...  some people live to work so they love what they do. but there are sub categories of this type cos some work and play hard and then there are some who work hard and even harder that they forgot to stop and smell the roses... everyone has their own choices... i work to live. it doesn't mean that i have to love my job... but at least i know i am good enough at my work to bring in the money to live. of course it doesn't hurt if i loved my job as well. its just that i haven't really found a job that i like... cos i don't like to work... hahahah :oP  my good pal is back for the weekend and is totally super busy getting the things she needs and grooming... i spent the whole afternoon at the hair salon with her...poor gal has to cut her hair short so its easier to maintain... i think it suits her as it makes her look more vibrant and younger... and it also makes her look more like a good girl and very oriental. very sia air stewardess look :oP  ric, dun be so stubborn! be strong and have the courage to accept the facts. no one can help u if u dun start helping urself.  -It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.

      not enuf sleep!!! but i was totally busy the whole day that i even forgot lunch! the stupid tax computations (3 in total)&nbsp;came in about lunch... so that kept me busy till the end of the day. i am forced to review 2 of the tax computations and get my boss to sign it by tomorrow and return it to the tax agent by tomorrow itself!&nbsp;considerate people aren't they? luckily i am efficient! heh... managed to&nbsp;finish checking 2 out of&nbsp;3 tax comps by 6pm...:o) just need to do some last minute checking before sending it for signature at lunch... although its almost done, the fact that i got it like super last minute for review unsettles me a little... perhaps i should&nbsp;write a disclaimer letter to the tax agent...  ricardoooo!!!! congratulations on passing your degree!!!! ur now a big boy oredi and can go out to fight in the working world! welcome to the club!! hope u enjoyed ur studying life a whole lot cos there's not much fun in working life! :oP  -If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.

      woke up this morning feeling a little sad, but then i thought why should i be sad for? the very thing that bothers me does not even concern me. no matter how much i worry about them as they are my closest friends, it is not my life but their own. i have done all that i could and should as a friend and it is up to them to walk their own path. taking it personally upon myself will only add to my emotional and physical stress and tire me out totally. no matter what happens, i will still be their friend and walk any path they choose with them.   one sleepless night down but stress level from work is rising rising!! arghh!! my company’s tax submission is due on saturday but i still haven’t seen the first draft computation from the tax agent! knock knock!! just in case u didn’t notice, today’s wednesday!! i can never understand why this particular firm’s auditor and tax agents like to torment me with their lack of time management and their total lack of professional courtesy in dealing with me! they always expect me to understand that they have lots of work and procedures to follow but yet they have never tried to understand my work load and expect me to do miracles by showering them with everything they want within days! well hello?!! if u don’t scratch my back, i won’t scratch yours! get a grip on managing your time!! its not like my company is a big shot listed company, it’s a small company for pete’s sake! just get it over with and then concentrate on your bigger money making clients!   anyone has a recipe for&nbsp;falling asleep at the right time?  -Don't walk behind me, I may not lead.

      i'm a little more rational today. i guess its an overspill from going to singapore that got me&nbsp;hiked up&nbsp;about SIA again. had a little thinking session&nbsp;and calmed myself down and realized that i need to be here. i may not know whether its my choice or&nbsp;everyone else's choice but the important thing is not where i end up at but rather how do i&nbsp;reach there.&nbsp;it may seem like a straight line now, but who's to say that other opportunities won't turn up tomorrow? but if i accept and&nbsp;label my life now as a straight line... it will be a straight line no matter how i look at it.&nbsp;so,&nbsp;i&nbsp;choose&nbsp;to live a life&nbsp;where&nbsp;although the lines&nbsp;seem straight but if&nbsp;u look closely enough, it really isn't that straight after all!   the past weeks have been... indescribable.&nbsp;still is. been a whirlwind hurricane with my thoughts and feelings jumbling up and down, thrown around and goodness knows what else.&nbsp;i have been&nbsp;happy, sad, upset, angry, disappointed all&nbsp;in a span of&nbsp;a couple of weeks fluctuating from each extreme and its not because of&nbsp;a guy at that! i repeat.. i am&nbsp;STRAIGHT.&nbsp;its just that my friend&nbsp;has been&nbsp;so&nbsp;frustrating!! i care and worry about her&nbsp;but she's like numb to everything. she's&nbsp;running&nbsp;around&nbsp;in circles even though&nbsp;she should know&nbsp;what she should do.&nbsp;and even&nbsp;if she didn't know, she's just too stubborn to&nbsp;listen to anyone or talk about it.&nbsp;i&nbsp; have never felt so helpless, disappointed and sad that she&nbsp;is hurting not only&nbsp;herself but&nbsp;others who&nbsp;cares and loves&nbsp;her.&nbsp;i know she doesn't read&nbsp;my&nbsp;blog, but i&nbsp;hope she knows that i am always&nbsp;on her side no matter what happens but that doesn't mean&nbsp;i&nbsp;agree with everything&nbsp;she&nbsp;does cos if i know that&nbsp;whatever she is doing is wrong, as a&nbsp;friend, i have to face up to her and tell her&nbsp;straight to her face, even if it means i will lose the friendship. which i sort of feel that it is happening now...&nbsp; i really hope for once she will learn to love herself more and&nbsp;find her true self and&nbsp;not a mirage of someone else's dreams.&nbsp;u don't have to&nbsp;proof anything to anyone, if not you&nbsp;will just be spending the&nbsp;rest of your life&nbsp;being someone else you are not.&nbsp;i hope she would&nbsp;think higher of herself and not&nbsp;set expectations that sky rocket through the universe because she has so much to offer&nbsp;but yet&nbsp;she never thinks that she is good enough. i hope she knows that she is not alone in the world as there are so many out there who loves her. i hope she knows that even if she is alone, there is nothing wrong with that just as long as she loves herself cos it is better to be&nbsp;happy alone than to be&nbsp;mildly happy with someone&nbsp;else. i hope that she will learn to be truly happy because she deserves to be. everyone does.   ah boy... i don't think that there is anything else i can say if you have made your choice.&nbsp; i hope you will be truly happy and&nbsp;that everything turns out for the best.   -The first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: Decide what you want.

      just got back from singapore yesterday nite. my pocket is totally burnt… g2000 and zara was on sale!! couldn’t resist the temptation… it was good shopping though. i only managed to walk orchard road and suntec city mall but still couldn’t see everything! luckily i still made time for my yummy dumplings at paragorn mall :o)  the bus ride wasn’t that bad actually. pretty comfortable and cheaper than taking the plane. i thought that i paid rm70 for the bus ride only but they served water, 1 meal, tea and fruit juice!! just like in planes! :oP  at the singapore custom on the way back, the customs officer was staring back at forth at my passport photo and me! haha.. i think i must really look terrible or different in the passport photo that kept him looking again and again! :oP  the best of all was that i get to visit my best friend. really missed her although she’s only been gone for about a week! haha :oP&nbsp;had a glimpse of what my best pal is going through in singapore settling into her new working life with SIA. she’s under training now and feels lonely but she looks so much more happier in SIA than she was in KL. PLUS, she’s slim down A LOT in just 1 week. she dropped one size!!   the main reason why i didn’t take up SIA’s offer was because of my brother’s illness and that my family needed me. although i have sent an email to decline SIA’s offer, my best pal said that they might still take me in as they are unsure of the reasons why i wasn’t there. i’m so tempted to try and go for it as it is different from what i am doing now and for the rest of my life. my heart tells me to go for it but my head, my family and many friends advised me against it because right now, i’m in a comfortable job (my working hours are strictly 830am to 530pm, 5 days week) earning enough money plus i get to take leave for holidays at least once a year so far. to a lot of people i am really lucky to lead a comfortable life and i should be grateful. but am i really truly happy where i am?   my godfather said that my personality and character is too pure and naïve to be an air stewardess as i would be hurt and cheated by men. i know that my godfather is older than me and have seen much more than i have and i know that time does not permit one to experience everything and that there are some experiences we can do without. but the opportunity is in my grasp now. will i really be hurt and am i really throwing myself into an ocean of sharks? will i come back from SIA being a stronger person and gaining the soft skills i’ve wanted or will i be so scarred with bullet holes to last me a life time? will i regret leaving the contented straight-lined world i have now? or will i regret taking up an unknown variable path? is my life just meant to be walked in its path now or to be changed to something totally different? sigh… i need some kind of enlightenment!!!  note for ah boy - do be strong and look further ahead. if u really love someone, u have to be someone that can be loved. its time to work towards a dream for yourself and on the way there, you will find someone to share your dream with you. i know its easier said than done, but it is important to take the first step. don’t be so stubborn!! u know your choices, u have to be aware that whatever you choose, you have to bear with the consequences and results. life is short so do try to be truly happy from the heart for most of the time u have.  -Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome. (Isaac Asimov, 1920 - 1992)-

      today’s a thinking day… a pretty blue one&nbsp;in fact... 1st&nbsp; reason = i am physically tired (berserk body clock) and&nbsp;2nd reason = i realized that i need my best friend more than she needs me. i miss her more now that she’s no longer around and busy with everything in her life. i guess i got too attached to her without realizing it. i know it may seem my brain has a loose bolt but i’m still 101% interested in men. she’s like a sister to me, like family and that hurts cos i think some part of me knows that our friendship is going to change even though i know we will always be best friends. just like all friendships, it will start, grow, mature and move on as life goes on. sounds pretty sad huh…but that doesn’t mean that they won’t stay friends for the rest of ur life.  &nbsp;  there’s always sadness in life and if u ponder upon it too long u will miss other things life may throw at u, be it good or bad. i’m just glad that someone took the time to put footprints in my life and i hope that i leave happy footprint in theirs.  &nbsp;  why are we all here? wat r our journeys in life headed to? there are those headed towards power, some towards money, others towards love, and then there are those who aren’t sure where they are going and is just moving along. i think we are all actually trying to find our own inner peace. just that everyone has their own way of finding it coupled with of course the elements of civilization, nature, our belief, society, etc...&nbsp;  i’m one of those who sort of knows where i want to head to but still unsure of whether i want to go in that direction. but for this weekend, i’m sure i’m going in the direction of singapore to visit mgk and partyyyy!!!!  -The most terrible poverty is loneliness and the feeling of being unloved.

       mgk has finally made up her mind and is going to be a glamorous air stewardess with sia!&nbsp;she's flying&nbsp;off to s'pore monday morning! :o( sighhh.. i'm so sad as it feels like i&nbsp;am losing my other half. we've been through so much ups and downs together here in kl.&nbsp;i am already missing her!! sniff~ wish i could have taken up the offer as well and join her in her new adventure, but i have to stay for my own reasons. although singapore is not far,&nbsp;it won't feel the same as when she's here. but she's always my best friend and i wish her all the best! do take care of urself mgk!! will miss u lots!!  &nbsp;  as my dearest friend is leaving, i have been busy trying to hang out with her as much as possible. we went clubbing&nbsp;at bar flam on wednesday and then&nbsp;rush on friday. this afternoon i helped her packed her luggage&nbsp;and then did some last min shopping at 1 utama.&nbsp;tomorrow, our last lunch together... i'm so saddd!!! sniff sniff!!!  &nbsp;  the whole week has been really tiring... i guess work has been really busy + i haven't&nbsp;rested and slept enough&nbsp;+ my best pal is leaving me in kl + a friend of mine is going through a break up... i am&nbsp;physically and mentally tired out.&nbsp;hopefully i will be able to catch up on some ZzzZ's and relax next week. wait a min...i don't think that's gonna happen.. looks like another busy week ahead!  &nbsp;  u know, in my last posting i mentioned that the world is really a small place. i am going to STRESS it in this posting again,&nbsp;the world&nbsp;REALLY is a small place. today, i met a girl through her boyfriend,&nbsp;which i haven't seen since i was like 12 years old!! goodness!! but it was&nbsp;nice seeing her again, although we didn't talk much. i have always liked her&nbsp;(not in a lesbian way, i am straight!) as i think she's really pretty and very sweet.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Happy Birthday Joyce!   -Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away.

      forgot to mention that on sat, a guy actually cooked dinner (appetizer-salad, main course-pasta n dessert–ice-cream) for me n my girlfriend (i'm not a lesbian!) :o) the dinner was good, thanks chris!  sunday’s shopping session was successful in causing a big hole in my pocket! but its well worth it. i got a nice working shirt from zara and a pair of jeans from DP. i need to stop shopping!! but everywhere i go, i see sales!! metrojaya sales is next… i’ve been eyeing a casual bag there…n i couldn’t get the earrings at 1 utama market cos the shop wasn’t open! arghh!!!   my weekend was physically energized with activities + lack of sleep, which probably explains why i am super tired now! but work has been a bit crazy the past 2 days. i think its pms season at office. everyone there seems to be in bad mood and poor me trying to dodge bullets!   mgk was suppose to have made up her mind abt sia. well, yesterday she wants to stay n work in kl. BUT today she wants to go sia. i think she’s going to drive herself, her family and me crazy. can’t blame her tho, it is a big decision. i’ll just yo-yo my feelings of joy/sadness till the end of this week when the battle will finally end.  had a thinking moment… the world is really a small place after all. anyone u pass by in ur daily life could very well be connected to someone u know. i never expected to catch a glimpse of a long lost friend’s father right at my office! it triggered the good old memories of my friend back in my school days and our friendship. wonder how he’s doing? hhmm.. another thought.. if the world really is a small place, then it would be better to be nice to everyone cos u neva know how that person may be connected to u through someone else that u may have been mean to rite?! :oP yikes!  -Without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods.

      this weekend is like a 1 utama marathon. on friday, dinner with family and house fitting shopping (but i still manage to get a pair of shoes..:oP). yesterday went to mph and helped a friend look for a book about games for kids but still manage to do a little shopping! hehe... as for today, i am going for a shopping session later in the afternoon. wonder whether i will get anything interesting? but i was eyeing a pair of earrings at the sunday market... :oP  checked out rush (used to be viva) yesterday. its my type of clubbing place cos the music is r&b which is something i can dance to :o) so at least i get some exercise! haha...but i didn't dance much last nite... guess i'm not comfortable with the environment at rush. doubt i'll be clubbing much anymore (not like i club much anyway..) cos my only clubbing friend is going away!! sighh...will miss her loads.  -The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing.

      the club near my office had this july promotion on penang food so yesterday i tried the assam laksa, rojak, ju hu eng chai, ABC and the yummiest of all-fried popiah. since it was my uncle's b'day i had a slice of choc cheesecake (la manila). totally bloated that i actually skipped dinner and had drinks at gloria jeans. i didn't know that mont kiara had the market on thurs nite as well besides the sat afternoon slot. but i prefer 1 utama's sunday market variety of accessories :oP   u know, fridays are suppose to be like a 'just got out of jail' day and filled with dinners and partying with friends. but today i'm going for a nice dinner and household shopping with my mom and my brother at one utama. something a little different from the usual friday routine. wait a minute... i don't have a usual friday routine! hahahah...   mgk is still in the middle of her battle...looks like it will last through the weekend. sigh.. poor gal... i know how she feels. hope that she survives the whole ordeal. chin up gal!!  a note for ah boy: sorry i can't get the job for u cos the boss said that he wants a permanent staff. n i was tied up at work yesterday so couldn't return ur call! dun merajuk! if not u won't look cute anymore :oP hehe...  -A lot of people mistake a short memory for a clear conscience.

      bbbrrr... been a cold day at office... hhmm.. come to think of it, it was cold last nite too when i was at the cinema! but it rained last nite... hence one would expect the cinema to be colder than usual... but i enjoyed watching spiderman 2. loved mary jane watson's (kirsten dunst) dress and clothes overall. and spidey's love hate best friend, harry was cute :oP hehe...  am efficiently trying to close my accounts at work... if my predictions are correct, it would be successfully be accomplished by noon tomorrow! yippee!! then to concentrate on more important task of looking for an assistant! hhmm.. i think looking for an admin assistant is so much easier... i guess accounts must be really boring :oP   i'm still in the shopping mood... wanna buy shoes. but can't seem to like any particular shoes or get any. i guess the deterrent for me getting any shoes is the heels! i don't understand why the heels of women shoes are so darn high? anyone knows of any places where i can get shoes with heels of abt 1 inch to 2 inches?  -Choose rather to be strong of soul than strong of body.

      ever had those blue days that u just didn't feel like going anywhere or do anything in particular? well, today is that lucky day for me :oP hehe.. wanted to do some shopping but was too lazy to go out.. the weather was cloudy for most of the day... so i stayed home to read and catch up on some tv.   i thoroughly enjoyed this month's cleo edition. there's a couple of interesting articles like the one on mind games where ur suppose to unlock the secrets of your inner self by looking into ur subconscious mind and a couple of eye opening articles on friends. would love to post the articles but this particular one has the shortest excerpt...;oP   is he too good for you... or just a bastard? if u tick more than 3 of the following, then ur dating a guy who thinks he's too good for you... up to u whether u agree.  does he break dates all the time, but expect u not to mind? does he refuse to take u home to meet his parents? does he go to work parties, but never invite u along? r u like his little secret he wants to keep from his mates? does he forever criticise your appearance? is he always on at u to "improve" yourself? do u often think he's just not "there" with u?   hhhmm.. i wonder whether its true? if a survey was done on it, i wonder how the result would turn out to be? ;oP haha...  -Nothing is more wretched than the mind of a man conscious of guilt.

      its been a busy day! went for an afternoon shopping session... had a good bargain at zara and mng sales... hhhmm.. am tempted to go for another round tomorrow :oP hehe... hopefully i can find some shoes...   then i'm off to banting to have beggar chicken, glutinous rice, duck, lamb, pork leg, etc... mostly cooked in the authentic beggar chicken style which is wrapped in paper, plastic, clay and baked in the earth. it has to be specially ordered at least a day in advance. although it took like an hour to get there but it was well worth the trip. the dishes were really good.  i thought i was going to nod off when i got back but i went yum cha instead with a friend of mine which i haven't seen in a while. u would expect that my energy is totally squeezed outta my system but i'm still pretty upbeat! my body clock must have gone totally awry cause i haven't been sleeping or resting well for the past 2 weeks!  a note to add...happy belated birthday alif! (his b'day was on friday, 2 july). sorry couldn't join u at ur celebration. hope u had loads of fun!  -Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. (Eckhart Tolle)-

      i'm so bloated... had lunch/high tea at renaissance hotel... the strawberries was good... yummm... then had family dinner at paris restaurant... luckily my lunch was mostly strawberries.. cos if not, dun think i'll be able to eat anything!  got to meet up with my ex colleagues after a long time... so it was my complaining time as i was neglected by them for the past couple of months! :oP first thing my friend noticed was.... 'ur hair is very long already... i really haven't seen you in a while...' which proved my point that i was being neglected...:oP it was good seeing them... they are really swamped with work... one of them had really bad tonsilitis but still want to go to work tomorrow!? hope that sue will take a rest at home. if not, what energy is there left to work? in some ways, i feel pretty lucky to be out of that job cos i think i will be totally burnt out... hang in there u guys!!!  -One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important.

      feels like a packed week... but i didn't do much... accompanied mgk at the hair salon on saturday afternoon and at night had drinks at coffee bean with another friend. bumped into tze ping, my ex colleague which i haven't seen in ages... almost a year i think! he's more prosperous now :oP  slept through the whole sunday morning and lazed about at home till dinner time. went to segambut to order dishes with a couple of friends. there's one particular interesting vegetable dish where they cut the leaves of the 'kai lan' and fried it with anchovies and served with the same vege which is boiled... 2 styles in a dish... interesting combination.  went to war with the tax computation yesterday... pending for the tax agents to get back to me... yesterday evening went for another round of drinks with another ex colleague...hey AB, thanks for looking me up and keeping in touch, i really appreciate it.  as for today... its the battle of closing the month end accounts to be continued till end of the week... so tonite, a much needed destress session is called for... am meeting up my childhood friend-which i haven't seen in a while as well- to catch up.  i've been feeling rather nostalgic...i miss the good old days at every point in my life... the school days, pre-u days, college days, uni days and the days in each firm i have worked for. people i have met and friends that i got to know.  its pretty sad cos i see them moving on and losing touch with me no matter how i try to hold on as our lives change...  -This isn't good or bad.
