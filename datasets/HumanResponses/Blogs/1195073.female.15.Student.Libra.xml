      a day in the life of molly o....  okay, this is, like, the third time i have typed all of this shit, and i'm sick and tired of using capitals, so i won't anymore.  i am close to not using punctuation anymore as well, but i want this to be readable.  anyways, there are a few people who really piss me off a lot all of a sudden.  lucky for them, i'm a good girl, and that had kept me from ripping their fucking heads off in a fit of rage.  i should really get a hobby, but the only thing i am really interested in is celebrity gossip.  anyways, language arts is a bitch.  am i the only one who thinks 'animal farm' is incredibly pointless?  and in social studies, my newspaper probably won't be finished, and if it's not, i will rip someone's head off, and it will probably be my own.  things that made my day: 1. access hollywood (last night's edition) 2. getting a 'b' on the science test that i only studied for for, like, ten minutes (ok, that was yesterday) 3. fred durst, colin farrell, brad pitt {HOTTIES, ok, a lot of people would probably disagree with fred durst, but fuck you 4. money 5. comedy 6. 'gangs of new york' getting oscar nominations 7. the fact that there are only 73 more days of school  things that made my day shitty: 1. 76 2. dance 3. negative people 4. cold weather  random ramblings of the day: ~i am desperately trying to figure out why kamikaze pilots wore helmets ~'break stuff' by limp bizkit is my new anthem ~when i grow up, i want to move to santa monica, california.  i will miss snow, so i will bring a snow machine and on warm summer days i will make tons of snow and spread it around my whole yard, just to weird my neighbors out.  i will then proceed to put on my swimsuit and roll around in the white stuff (the snow, you perves!!)  i will then put on some big band/jazz/swing music and proceed to drink martinis all afternoon while i tan.  quote of the day: “I am free of all prejudices.

      well well well  today was pretty good.  i have my language arts project to finish, and i probably should work on it tonight, but know me, i won't work on it til tomorrow.  oh well, we get out early.  the Mousetrap Derby is tomorrow too.  i'm quite nervous about it.  i don't know why, i just REALLY hope our car works well.  we will find out tonight!!!  i am going to lauren's for an hour to wrap up the work on our car.  then, we are getting Mexican for supper on the way home!!  TACOS!!!!!!!!!!  yum, yum!!!  i have decided to make a weekly party-weekend quote for friday, it will be: "If it's illegal to rock 'n' roll, throw my ass in jail"  --Kurt Cobain i think that's a party quote, kinda, but kinda not.  oh well, it's still my party-weekend quote.  it will be here every friday.  things that made my day good: 1. dreaming of summer break 2. thinking about completing my language arts project 3. the thought that what goes around comes around 4.

      i'm soooo happy baby!!!  today was a good day.  i got an extension on my language arts project, a B on my science test, and we are done with dance in gym.  YAY!!!!!  ahhhh.....  life is good!!  just watch, tomorrow will be crap.  we have the Mousetrap Derby on wednesday, but we get out early, so it's all gravy!!!  that means shortened classes!!!!!  anyway, the Grammys were pretty bad.  there are normally pretty boring, but they were espcially bad this year.  i honestly think norah jones is a bit overrated, but i'm also glad that avril lavigne got robbed, so it's balanced.    things that made my day good: 1. pizza hut breadsticks 2. hotties {see Feb. 11th post 3. extenstion on my language arts project 4. not a lot of homework 5. understanding algebra 6. understanding science 7. understanding social studies 8. life-size ping-pong in gym 9. listening to jay-z  things that made my day bad: NOTHING!!!  random ramblings: ~martin scorsese is the bomb!!!!! ~US Weekly is my favorite magazine ~i want to be famous when i grow up, but will not attend the Grammys unless they turn it into a disco inferno!!  *sings*roller coaster of love oooh oooh ooooh oooh oooh!!!!!*  quote of the day: "If it weren't for the last minute, nothing would get done." -- Anonymous

      Ahhhh.........  relaxation........  I think we should get every Wednesday off of school.  Maybe when I become president I can change that, even though I don't think the president would have much control over that.  Oh well, executive orders......  As mentioned, there is no school today thanks to the snow storm dammit.  Now the elementary kids have a FIVE DAY weekend, while we slave away at school.  NOT FAIR!!  If you get a chance, go pick up a copy of US Weekly.  It's great!!  Bye bye!!

      Holy Shit!!!!!!!!  Actually, nothing that out of the ordinary today.  No homework, but I should finish my Ernest Green essay.    I have decided that I am against war.  I'm a Republican, and I love Bush to death, but I think he is taking the wrong route here.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who will be at any anit-war rallies or anything along those lines, but I do thing that Bush is kinda 'jumping the gun' here (no pun intended).  Like the Matts said in social studies, I think the war may be more of a personal crusade for Bush, and Iraq has really done nothing to provoke it.  We have no proof that they have ties to any terrorist networks, so really, we have no right to say 'Oh, we can have nukes, but you can't!!!'  Anyway, wow, I just scared myself there.  A little too serious.  Actually I'm serious in all of these, but...............  most of the stuff I say on here is just plain stupid.  Anyways, not much else to say today.  WHOA!!!!  That's a first!!!!  And Matt Z., your Italian soda can KISS MY ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  MEXICAN SODA IS THA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Especially Limon!!!!!

      Ugh......  Today was actually a good day, but there were a few things that made me mad.  Anyways, now is not important.  I'm too busy worrying about getting old.  I already use anti-aging cream on my face, OK?  I am worried that my four/five month tanning salon stint last year did my skin in.  I shouldn't have done that.  Anyways, I hope I don't start looking old.  I also hope I don't start ACTING old....  as in like an old person, not old as in mature.  If anyone ever has to help me take a shit, take me out back and shoot me.  I also heard that working out too much makes your skin bad too!  YUCK!!  Like they showed Madonna, and she looks awful since she began that microbitic diet!  Well, I guess that was dieting, not exercise, but still, YUCK!!  Anyways, my media whore dreams are still alive and kickin' and I am beginning to plan my take over of the media!  BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well, you might scoff at this now, but wait until I win my Oscar, and see what you think then!!!!!  I probably won't be there to accept my Oscar though, because the Oscars and Grammys are both pretty boring, but my disco inferno idea still stands.  Even though I don't know what a disco inferno is.    And I am pissed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A true injustice has occured!!!!!!  Can you believe that Rob Marshall, who directed 'Chicago' beat Martin Scorsese for a Directors' Guild Award??  That means he will most likely win the Oscar for Achievement in Directing as well.  DAMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!  This is MARTIN SCORSESE people!!!!!!!!!!!!!  He needs to win.  I mean, he's sixty, he might not have much longer!!!!!!!!!!!  C'mon people!!!!  'Chicago' really isn't that great!!!!!!!!!!  GANGS OF NEW YORK on the other hand, is a materpiece, but then again, I'm only an eighth grader so I don't know too much.    Things that made my day good: 1. No homework!!! 2. Easy math!!! 3. Star Magazine 4. Peanut Butter Cap 'N Crunch  Things that made my day bad: 1. Liars, especially when I don't know what side is doing the lying 2. Slight 76 trouble  Quote of the day: “You catch you child swearing. Do you wash his mouth out with soap? Or do you sit him down and explain that he'd better not fucking do it again? I think you know what to do"  --Conan O'Brien  THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY DAY TO LOOK AT MY SITE!!!!!!!!!!!!  Y'ALL COME BACK NOW, YA HEAR?????

      Wow!!  I have decided to use capital letters for once!!  I have been thinking a lot.  I think that I would like to go into a job in the communication field.  You know, radio, journalism, TV.  I am fame-hungary, though.  Who isn't, right?  I will be a media whore when I grow up.  I want to be famous.  I want to be rich.  And, I want to be the center of attention.  That's my problem.  I get a lot of attention as it is, and it still isn't enough.  I WILL be famous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  BWAHAHAHA!!!!!!  I will virtually control the media!!!!!!!!!  Kinda like Britney Spears, except hopefully a little smarter (no offense, she's not STUPID, she's just.............  blonde.  Even though judging by her dark roots, not naturally.  I think the peroxide soaks through your skull and effects your brain like being blonde does, though.  Then again, I should shut-up because I used to have my hair highlighted to look blonde.).  Holy shit, I got waaaay off topic there.  Anyways, reading 'Animal Farm' in Language Arts really made me realize how greedy I am.  One day, we were talking about if everyone was equal, there would be somebody who would be greedy and want more, and I think that person would be me.  I also think that my daily routine lacks substance, but I honestly don't know how to change that, so if you do, e-mail me at mollio_88@hotmail.com, and tell me (knowing some of my friends, it will be incredibly perverted, so NO PERVERTED ANSWERS, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!).  Anyway, back to the greedy thing, I like making waste your time reading this shit, too.  This is all completely useless information, and some people still actually read it!!!  I LOOOOOOVE that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyways, enough about me, I'm going to a baby shower today, and I hope to eat out, then, I have to do my stupid homework.  Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love this thing!!!!!!!!  ME, ME, ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's terrific!!!!  Gosh, I'm in a conceited, selfish mood today.  That's always good.  Well, on that note, I will talk to you tomorrow (God willing)!

      OKAY, I'VE BEEN SLACKING!!!!!!!!!!  Okay, okay, I'm a slacker!!  I've been busy....  well, lazy.  Ugh, well, today, we went to the bank, the Fish Shack, and Blockbuster.  Then, we went to the Great Dragon for lunch, and then Hy-Vee.  I watched "Signs," but I wasn't really paying too much attention to it, though.  Oh well, I will watch it again later.  I have to go to a baby shower tomorrow.  I was put in charge of games.  Oh boy.  I am thinking of making one where I will take assorted types of baby food, peel the label off, and pass the little jars of baby food around, then, people have to taste them and try to recognize what type they are, the person who gets the most correct wins.  I don't know what other ones to do.  Maybe I will look around on-line.    Friday was sh!t.  A lot of people were pissing me off, plus, I didn't feel well.  I barfed Thursday night.  It was nasty!!!  I popped some capillaries in my face while I was at it, as well.  It didn't hurt, though, and I was actually quite surprised at that.  Gosh, it was all chunky and this really nasty shade of brownish-yellow.  It looked like that creamed corn or whatever it's called.  I will never eat that stuff again, even though that's not what caused it 'cause I didn't eat that stuff on Thursday....  or any day in the last few months for that matter.  Wednesday was.................  to be quite honest, I don't really remember Wednesday.  Same goes for Monday and Tuesday.  We started materials and processes or MAP, as I like to refer to it.  Mr. Lund is pretty scary, but we are doing pottery, so I think I can forget my Mr. Lund-o-phobia for a while to focus on my pot (as in my POT, as in short for POTTERY, not the drug, just thought I'd clear that up).  molly

      Well,  Courtney and I are in the planning stages for our 'Ghetto Bash,' that's the tentative name, but it will most likely change......  if we have it.  We're planning on having it at her house (they have a pool!!!!).  Not many pools in the ghetto, you say??  It can be a boughetto party (upper class, yet ghetto at the same time).  We will have to find out some more about street culture before we can really plan anything.  We also will need to find some props and stuff..........  I'm thinking HUGE gold chains and stuff!!!!  I WILL GET TO WORK ON THE GUEST LIST/INVITATIONS AS SOON AS SOMEBODY FINDS OUT IF WE CAN HAVE IT OR NOT (if I'm in charge of the guest list, you know who WON'T be invited)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think we should play a game called 'Rob Your Neighbor Blind' where you turn off the lights and let everyone kick each others asses to see who can steal the most stuff from everyone......  OK, maybe that's not the best idea.......  Anywho............  Courtney, e-mail me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Matt Z, you dissed my posts at the MZM Forums!!!!  POINTLESS????

      I'm BAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!!!  Sorry, it's been a while, but I have a lot of updates for you.  Here's the dish:  ~First off, 28 is a major biotch!!!!!!  I have been in an intense argument with her since Monday, but we've been in a disagreement since last Friday.  I wrote her an e-mail and told her what I really think of her.  I got a lot of praise from some people, as well *cough* Holly, Lauren, and Courtney *cough.*  I hope she doesn't read this.  I don't think she does, I doubt she even cares, she didn't reply to the e-mail, but I don't care, at least she knows what I think of her.  At first I thought it was too cruel, but an incident between us on Tuesday just threw me over the edge.  ~I have been trying to talk Courtney into throwing a 50-ish/retro vibe party to celebrate the end of the school year.  I don't think my coaxing is working, but it's still worth a try.  ~Conferences were today.  My parents and Mr. Brauhn are all pissed because I seem to be spending too much time on the internet.  This was probably most likely because I got a C+ on the last test.  Oh well, what can I say??  I hate science.  ~Other than science, I'm doing well in school.  Mrs. Recker seems to like me a lot better than I thought, as does Mrs. Digmann and Mr. Hejhal and perhaps even Mr. Lund.  Or maybe they were just being cordial in front of my mami and papi.  Mr. Burns said that some of my reactions to his thoughts on current events are 'classic.'  That's always good.  ~Lauren and I are working on a "28's Greatest Hits" compilation.  It includes songs that remind us of her, including "Break Stuff" by Limp Bizkit, "Bitch" by Mereidth Brooks, "Complicated" by Avril Lavigne (she sucks ass, but the song does remind us of 28), and "Kill You" by Eminem.  If you would like a copy, e-mail me and I will burn you one when I complete the process (Be fore-warned (sp??): THE ALBUM WILL CONTAIN EXPLICIT LYRICS)  ~To those who read this and have the Norah Jones CD, 28 fell through with her promise to burn me a copy, and I would greatly appreciate it if someone else could burn it for me, or let me borrow it to burn it myself.  If you burn it for me, I will provide the CD, or pay you back if you use one of your own.  ~I am also in the planning stages for the Best Summer Ever.  ~I pray for all of the soldiers and their families, but I have changed my mind on my anit-war stance.  I say that we really need to get rid of Hussein and his dirty-ass sons.  OK, I just stooped to an inmature level, but I don't give a dead rat's ass.  Well, that's about it.  THINGS THAT MADE THE LAST 5 DAYS GOOD: 1. HOTTIES {see Feb. 11th post 2. Jamming to 50 Cent every morning. 3. Warm weather  THINGS THAT MADE THE LAST 5 DAYS BAD: 1. 2828282828282828!!!!!! 2.

      My parents got me a new outfit of American Eagle today.  Veeerrrry nice.    In other Molly news, 28 and I still aren't speaking.    Anyways, onto better topics, my MAP pot is actually going pretty well.  Hopefully, I won't have to start over tomorrow.  I'm too lazy to type more, I just thought I'd check in so y'all know I'm still alive!!  TTYL!!!  50 CENT KICKS ARSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  PEACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      OLLEH!!!!!!  HAHA!!!  What's up my crazy cohorts??  Well, I have been up to a lot.  Realtions with 28 have IMPROVED, IMPROVED, mind you.  We are not really friends, but we're not enemies.  We talk to each other a little bit.  I'm still not planning on aplogizing for the e-mail, though.  School has been going pretty well, except for science, which is a bitch.  It's pretty hard, we get to work in groups, but it's worth five evaluations.  What a pain in the ass!!!  If we get an F on it, we're fucked for the rest of the year.  Sorry about the language, but it's the truth.  Materials and processes (MAP), is going ok.  My whell-thrown pot better turn out, cause I'm depending on it.  I have finished my first one, but we need two.  Oh well, with one hour and fourty five minutes to work on it, it should turn out well, as long as the clay doesn't get bad on me.  Courtney is in the same predicament as I am, and Colter........  ah, Colter..............  he's bascially screwed.  Today was the deadline for our pots, as tomorrow Mr. Lund is going to show us how to glaze them.  He was hardly done with his first pot today, but then it got ruined, so now, he's totally screwed.  I have one pot done, and the other will be wheel-thrown, so I think that'll work.  I also found out that I will be going to Hawaii in a couple of years.  You see, my cousin wants to drop out, but my aunt told him that if he graduates, she will take him to Hawaii (she's not even his mother, she's his aunt, too!).  She wants my mom and me to come along.  I don't know why my dad isn't coming, the aunt that we're going with is his sister, but he probably won't be home.  Things that made the last few days good: 1. HOTTIES {see Feb. 11th post 2. finishing my pot in MAP 3. easy social studies test 4. cosmic bowling  Things that made the last few days bad: SINCE I'M IN A GOOD MOOD AT THE MOMENT, NOTHING!!!!!!!!

      Howdy doodles my crazy co-horts!!!!!!  What is up???  Not much here.  The science and MAP tests today went well, and there's nothing too exciting going on tomorrow, so with that, good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow!!!!

      Happy Happy, Joy Joy  Well, today went really well.  In MAP, I orginally thought that Mr. Lund had thrown my wheel thrown pot away, but he didn't.  But I made a new one anyways, so now I have three.  My only problem is that if Friday is the last day he will kiln or kilm or fire the pots, I probably won't be able to glaze my second one.  Oh well, you get a C- if it's not glazed.  Anyway, our homebase is bad, so a cop came in and talked to us, just us, no other homebases, just ours.  I feel like a rebel now, even though I didn't have anything to do with what they were scolding us about.  That's about it.  We get out early tomorrow (unless we have a delay, which we might because there is talk of it getting foggy tomorrow) and we have advisory, so we will have short classes.  It will be like that on Thursday and on Firday about 3/4 of the honors classes will be gone because of the band/orchestra/choir city tour, so it should be a fairly easy day, I don't think they'll give us a lot to do if most of the class is gone.  Aside from a (group) science test and a MAP test (which I really need to do well on) on Thursday, nothing too big this week.  I'll try to update tomorrow, if my oh-so-busy schedule allows it.  CHECK OUT 24Dotz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am their legal consultant/ PR representative, so don't f**k with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Well, I have a wheel thrown pot, but I have to do the tooling, and I don't know how.  I'm supposed to go in tomorrow morning to do it at 7:45, but the pot has to be sitting out for an hour.  I'm sure he won't be there at 6:45 so I might go after school on Tuesday.  He better not throw it out, either.  My name is on the bag that it's wrapped up in and all, and Alicia showed me where to put it in the back room, but I still don't trust him.  Anyways, I just realized last week that my life is really boring and routine.  I figured that out when I could write all of my homework in my assignment notebook after first period.  Yuck.  I hate it.  I hope my whole life isn't going to be this............. normal.  I guess that's how to describe it.  Normal, dull, boring, routine........ however you want to describe it.  I just really hope that when I grow up, I'm not one of those soccer moms.  You know the type, get up, make breakfast, get kids up, feed them breakfast, make sure kids get ready, get yourself ready, take kids to school, go to work, work your ass off all day, pick kids up from school, take Timmy to soccer, take Mary to ballet................................  BLAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's boring just thinking about it.  That would totally suck.  I don't plan on living like that.  Maybe I just won't have kids, but I really don't think that would stop my life from being routine.  I'm going to aspire to bigger and better things (not like that, perverts........... well, maybe like that, too)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Wow  Sorry I haven't updated in a while.  There hasn't really been a lot going on.  I just got back from the dance/Happy Joe's.  It was fun, but it got me thinking.  Well, some people's behavior at the dance and the book 'The Catcher in the Rye' got me thinking.  I have come to a conclusion: I know a lot of phonies.  You know the type.  The one's who are sooo nice to your face and talk crap behind your back, or they do that to somebody else.  I was like that, but I got sick of it.  And yes, I'm writing this for a reason.  UGH!!!!  I am soooo pissed off right now!!!  And here's what I'll do: I'll confront the person who I'm talking about (there are a lot of phonies, especially in Language Arts, where I counted 13 in our class) and tell this person what I think about what they're doing, and then, we'll get into an argument, and then, we'll make up and be friends again.  Our friendship is a big gamble, yes, but this person is really pissing me off!!  And the funny thing is that when I grow up, I want to be a politician or an actress!!  I want to go into the fakest industries/professions there are!!!!  Oh well, I will keep it real!!!!  I will update you tomorrow and tell you what happened with the person who is making me mad!!!

      OK...  Well, the one person the last post was aimed at apoliogized without any type of coaxing, which was unexpected on my part.  Maybe it was just because there were a few of us pissed off.  Anywho, things have been going quite well, I was once again reminded today that I know a lot of phonies, but it's OK, summer break is only 14 school days away!!  THANK GOD!!!  Even though next year it's off to high school, and I'm a little nervous about that.  Well, back to the present.  My biggest problem is our Speech to Inspire and Impress for LA.  I have mine written and all, but it's pretty terrible.  We are doing watercolor paintings in MAP.  It's soooo hard.  Actually, it is kinda difficult, but it's fun at the same time.  We are studying the Civil War in Social Studies.  Easy potatoes.  In Algebra, we are starting Geometry, you know, they want to prepare us for next year.  Well, I'm doing some interviews and shit for 24dotz, so I'll talk to you later!!

      Hola!!!  Hello everyone!!  It's summer!!!!!!!!!!!  WOOOOHOOOO!!!!!!!  I have been up to nothing for the last 10 days.  Well, I got a cell phone.  Aside from watching E! and Court TV, I am reading Hillary Clinton's book.  I never thought I'd say that.  It's not really changing my mind about her much, though.  It's a fairly good read.  I'm also volunteering at Mercy Hospital this summer, since they are doing construction on the ER.  They are totally re-doing it, so they need me to give people directions and stuff.  The worst part is, the temporary entrance for everyone (including the ambulances), so that could get quite gruesome.  They need some more help, too.  The downside is that I had to get a TB test.  I have to get another one in a couple of weeks because that was my first one.  I have to go get read today, as a matter of fact.  Maybe my mom will take me when she gets off work.  I will talk to you later!!

      SUMMER!!!!  Hello everyone.  I'm not sure if anybody still reads this, but, if so, thank you.  Well, I don't know where to start.  I finished Hillary's book, and now I've moved on to Bill O'Reilly's 'The No-Spin Zone.'  It's a good read.  More to the point and less drawn out than Hillary Clinton's book.  Maybe I like this book better because I like  him  better.  Anyway, I'm just going to shut-up now.  I probably won't update again until after school starts.  I know I'm going to hate high school.  Talk to you later.......

      Hey,  I'll be leaving for South Dakota tomorrow morning, and I won't be back until next Thursday night.    I also want to let all of you know that I have a new AIM screen name.  It's MooShooMollyO.  I have about 14 screen names now, but the only two I use are MooShooMollyO or Molls Dolls 88.  I don't remember the passwords for the other ones  Oh, and if anyone knows when we get out of school this year, or when Winter Break begins, please e-mail me.  Well, I'll be going now.  This post was waaaay too serious, but it's business matters.

      i've been thinking.............  does anybody read this anymore?  i don't know.  it's fun for me to write, but i feel like people don't read it.  oh well, maybe when school starts again people will read it more.  i was just wondering because i've been looking through the archives and i found a lot of my posts funny.  wow, i might be a comedian and i don't even know it.  well, i'm not that funny, but it's a nice thought.    in other news, i need to start collecting FUNNY quotes and crap for the school year, so if you have some, send 'em in.  you know how when we have school i post my little rambling thingys at the end of each post.  well, i haven't forgotten about that, so, i need more quotes.  a lot of those quotes are funny, though.  wow.  they're not mine, that's why they're funny.  ugh, i don't know what i'm saying.  i'm just babbling.  and i like it!!!  i want a radio talk show.  like bob and tom.  they're funny.  but i want my show to be appropriate for everyone.  not really.  i have my school shopping done.  just not for my supplies cause i don't know what i need yet.  i'll be in south dakota with my parents, my aunt carole and my cousin abby all next week, so don't expect to hear much from me.  so, what do you think of the recall election in california?  wow, it's a real mess.  i'd vote for gary coleman myself.  i'm a republican, but i don't trust schwarzeneggar much.  i think he's just running as a republican because people are going to lean more towards the right because they're pissed off at davis.    well, i'll talk to you later.  hasta la vista.  oh, there i go again!!!!!!!!

      High School.........  Well, I started high school yesterday, and to be honest, I don't like it that much.  I don't know.  Maybe I'll get used to it and wind up loving it (that's what happened in junior high).  It's really strange to me right now.  I don't like my locker being so far away from my classes, and I don't like having older people in my classes.  Oh, and I can't get my locker open.  I went to the activities office and they gave me about five different combinations to try for it.  I haven't tried any of them, though, because I left school right after I got the combinations, so I hope one of them works.  The lady sounded pretty sure that one would, though.  I'll update more later, I gotta go get school supplies.

      Hello!!!  Well, I figured I'd check in and let all of you (if it should even be plural) know what's going on in my oh-so-interesting life.  Well, the high school situation is improving.  The older people don't scare me so much anymore, some of them are actually pretty nice.  My classes are all easy (as of right now), with the exception of English, which is a nightmare.  She keeps piling assignment on top of assignment until we are all confused about what is due when!  Lunch is great, too.  Lemon freeze cups are a gift from God!  AND I got my locker open!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I should also let you know that 24dotz has disbanded.  Well, I guess Matt is forming a new band with the name 24dotz, it's ska or something like that, nothing like the original.  Then again, he might have decided to change the name (if not Nate could take him to court claiming ownership of the name, a la Roger Waters and Pink Floyd).  Then again, the Pink Floyd name is actually worth something (no offense to anybody in 24dotz).  I really don't know what went wrong.  I guess it was some little rift in the band.  Other than that, everything was going amazing!  I mean, they had only gone through about four drummers in a matter of three months, I just don't see a problem.  OK, I don't want to get Martini or Hannibal (?) pissed at me, so I'll shut up now.  Oh, I also thought I'd let everyone know that I'm going to France this summer!!!  I'm not sure for how long, though.  It was originally going to be three weeks, but we decided that that's a long time to be overseas (and away from my parents, in my case).  So I think it'll only be ten days.  I'm not sure about the schedule yet, either, but my dad and I discussed it and we figure that my parents will drive my aunt and I to Chicago, then we'll either fly to New York City or Washington D.C. and meet my cousin and her two daughters, and then fly straight through to Heathrow in London.  We'll spend a couple days in London and then drive through the chunnel over to France.  We'll be based in Paris, but we will take day trips.  I'm sooooooooo excited!!!!  My aunt and I can't speak French, but my cousin's daughters go to a private school in Washington D.C., and all of their classes are in French, so they're very fluent.  Well, it's about 30 minutes past my bedtime, so I should go.  Ciao!!!

      Okay, okay, okay.....  I know, I haven't updated in a while, and I have some explaining to do.  I didn't post because...........  I'm lazy.  And I kinda forgot about this little BLOG called The Daily Mollio Show.  Did I ever tell you where that name comes from?  No?  Okay, well I don't remember, so it doesn't really matter.  We got report cards yesterday.  I have an A+ in Global Issues, A's in Geometry, Spanish, P.E., and Biology, an A- in Keyboarding, and a B+ in Honors English.  My GPA is 3.8.  Shit, I was soooo pissed.  My English grade was very close to an A-.  Well, that's all for now.  I'm going to Chicago on Sunday for Spanish Club.  Adios!!!  MOLLIO I

      Hello all of my loyal readers!!!!  How is it out there in computer-land?!?!  Well, I'm OK.  High school is soooo overrated, though.  For all you not-yet-to-high school readers of mine..... don't get your hopes up, it's nothing that amazing.  Oh, well I'll shut up about it for now.  Well, I'm drinking a Tom and Jerry and watching A Christmas Carol.  Just chillin' like a villian.  OK, that's lame.  I've made a groundbreaking decision, though.  When I grow up, I'm gonna be rich.  So then I can afford fancy clothes.  And I can do charity work, of course. 0 : )    Well, Happy Holidays to all and don't expect another update until February/March-ish.  Maybe I'll do something kind of neat for the one year anniversary of the Daily Show with Mollio on February 10.  That's right folks, this blog is almost a year old!!!!!  Until then.....

      HELLO!!!!!!  OK, it's been about five months since I've posted a real update, sorry about that.  Anyway, I've been great!  Greater than great, really.  But then I realize we're about to get out of school for the summer and I'm not so great.  My summer is not going to be too great, I have a feeling.  I won't miss getting up at five thirty in the morning, sure, but there are other things about school I will miss.  I'll get to that later.  Anywho, yesterday was pretty fun.  My parents worked so I had to get ready for school on my own, but I do that anyway so it was no big deal.  Alicia gave me a ride because she didn't have early bird gym.  We got to school and it was pouring rain.  The worst part was the fact that we were towards the back of the parking lot.  I hauled ass to the front doors.  Usually we walk around and go down through the courtyard to locker bay and ish.  So, Kelsi and I went into the bathroom and checked our makeup and went to locker bay.  Then I went to geometry, boring as usual.  We're starting trigonometry and it's been pretty easy so far.  Then came speech, which was awesome!  We have to do skits about good and bad job interviews and our groups bad interview kicks ass!  The good one it just plain stupid, though.  It's crazy.  Gym sucked.  THEN I SAW HIM!!!!!!!!!!!  It's nuts.  I told him on Thursday that I think he's hot.  He was walking up the stairs behind me and I turned around and told him that he's hot.  He kind of looked at me wierd because I've never talked to him before and I was like "I'm sorry." And he blushed (BIG TIME!) and smiled was like, "It's OK!"  He said that it was OK not once, but twice!  So it was really OK.  He loves me, I can tell.  Who doesn't, right?  Then I told him the whole story after fourth hour, and he laughed.  He was at his locker for some reason yesterday and he even changed his clothes.  I'm not sure why he was there.  I didn't say anything to him, though, because I'm a dumbass.

               You Are    Whole Lotta Love        You are interested in 2 things in this world:  Love and sex.  You are a complete romantic (and probably a big whore.)  You just want to be loved.  You really value your friends and your family, but more than anything, you value your boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/person you are stalking.  You don't necessarily value yourself very much, but it's ok because you will find someone else to value you.  Sad, but you're oblivious, so it doesn't matter.   urlLink Take the Which Led Zeppelin Song Are You? Quiz     That was always my favorite LZ song, so it's all good.  Besides, it's a little true right now.  I'll be posting with new Molly news later.

         Hello, everyone. Do you like the new layout? I'm sure you do. 33 days until I go to Europe! I'm excited.         I went to a partay yesterday. It was a lot of fun! I grabbed this one guy's tit and my cousin grabbed his belt and started whipping him with it. It was good, clean fun. Then we rode in the back of the truck to the Stumble Inn. There were about six of us in the back and three up front. The Stumble Inn. What a place. It was boring, so we left and went back to the party. Almost killed myself doing fireworks. Not fun. But they were pretty. We did some sparklers, but one, like, exploded on me and I got scared.         Heard some pretty interesting things about  JW . It's not actually about him, though, and I'm not too worried about it.       Then I went home and our neighbors dog got out, so I went looking for him, then found him and told my dad to tie him up.

       urlLink     I'm a girl, though.    urlLink     Well..... I've never thought of myself like that, but OK.    urlLink     That makes up for the Paris Hilton slut thing. Besides, I am lazy. And untalented.        urlLink

         Holy shizzle! My mom just called and said that I'm going to the ortho on the 19th and he's gonna start taking my braces off, then I'm going back on the 27th and he's gonna finish taking them off!!! So, I'll have them off before I go back to school, bitches! And then I gotta go back in on September 13th and get fitted for a retainer.           4 days, ho!

        So, I just talked to my mom. She was like, "They said no to the surgery and the orthodontist is gonna call tomorrow about taking your braces off, so you can stop pouting." So, I'm cool now. Except the car, but I have until January/February.         Might as well have fun `cause your happiness is done and your goose is cooked!         Good song!

         Eh.....       I'm majorly depressed right now. For starters, I went to the ortho today and we hadn't heard about the surgery, so I have to have my braces on for another month (until the 27th, at least), BUT when I got home there was a message on the answering maching about the surgery and they said I couldn't get it so my mom called the ortho, but I haven't talked to her all day because I'm pissed, so I don't know what they said. Maybe they said I can go back tomorrow..... *crosses fingers*      AND, the car I want was gone from the lot when we drove by. I guess it doesn't really matter because my dad didn't want me to get a VW Beetle, he wants me to get some stupid Toyota thing because it's a better car. UGH!!!! Old people! They don't care about image at all. Toyotas are for 40-something people, not a 16 year old. My parents have Toyotas. Not me. They're OK cars, though. But the VW is soooooo cuter!      Anywhoooo, went to the travel agent and got my plane tickets and everything and then we went to Olive Garden for lunch and then we went to Target and then Old Navy. Then I came home and did my exericse, but I'm not done with it yet, I'll finish it later tonight.      We also heard about a sweeeeeeeet new mall in Des Moines, and my ma said we may need to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check it out! Good news, good news.....

         Yo, yo, yo!! What's up bizzzzitches?!?! 6 days until I leave. You know what's up!       Well, I'm working on packing right now. I don't know if everything I want to pack will fit in the suitcase. If the airline looses my luggage I will be pissed. I have good clothes packed (I have to look super glamourous).      Speaking of good clothes, I went shopping again yesterday. Got another pair of shoes from American Eagle and a pair of pants and a shirt I've been wanting forever from there as well. I got pajamas and socks, too. And I got my hair did and a pedicure! Now I got cute little rhinestone flowers on my big toenails!      Tomorrow I gotta go to the ortho and HOPEFULLY he's gonna start taking my braces off.      Molly          "Girls only want boyfriends who have great skills.
