      First things first. I am slightly confused at times by Icelandic-English, but I believe not as confused as you would be by my English-Icelandic, so we'll stick to English as a medium of conversation, I guess (until we all master Icelandic). It might be tough for Lars, Magnus, Vegard, et al. to give up their "primitive" tongues and learn Icelandic though (haha). Well, believe it or not, I hung out with an Icelandic girl last night. Yes, there are more than 2 of them. I couldn't get enough of Iceland, what with the sheep cheek and dried fish, so boy was I glad to find out my friend is dating a girl who grew up in Iceland until age 16. We shot the shit about all things Icelandic, from that crazy non-alcoholic malt stuff (child's play) to Thule. I exhausted her knowledge of Iceland in about 5 minutes, so I proceeded to teach her all the things Ulli (sorry I have no accent mark ` key) taught me about Iceland and life in general. So in other words, the conversation continued another week :)  Ulli prepared me well to educate her about her own country.   So, I've got my fingers crossed that this e-mail will actually send and I will not lose everything I've hitherto typed. You see, I'm still using the old dial-up modem, yeah the one from the 90s, and it's not the most reliable. George W. is off playing with laser-guided Smart bombs somewhere, and I can't even get a freakin cable modem. Blame my tightwad parents for that one, I suppose. Oh well, back to school in a few weeks. Then it's back to real studying and real classes. No more ESADE Leadership, where the essence of the course is "do whatever you want and tell us that you learned something in the end." As this is my first blogging experience, I should probably cut it short lest I become burnt out at a young age.   Tim

      If you are a "gringo" visiting for the first time please read the thing below first but if not go a head and read this.  Well its best to begin bloging writing about something that nobody should realy care about but.... what the heck.... The climate here has been realy strange and I think Iceland is again behaving like ICELAND. Yesterday I wen to work at 8 in the morning and yes there was a rather bad weather but that doesnt happen to rarely in this country but usually it just goes by. Well I saw that it didnt realy but when I turned on the radio it said that pretty much every road out of the city was closed and on the others one was recomended to use a well equiped jeep if going out of the city. There where like 500 incidents of people having to call the rescuers to help them out of snow coz they werent going anywhere without help. I heard about this one guy who was suppose to arrive at work at 16 (thats 4 pm for those on my west) but went out of his house at 10 just to help people out of snow, his girlfriend told me that it was most definatly his favorite day of the year!!! The guy who was suppose to do my job at 16 (see above if you cant remember) lives in town very close to Reykjavík and when I looked outside he just saw the top of his car so he called his dad who has a "well equiped jeep".  In the most windy spot of Reykjavík the wind speed went to 30 meters a second so I hope nobody forgot their laundry outsite.   You are most definatly rather bored by this so Im gonna tell you some strange facts about Icelanders and the year 2003:  1. In the begining of this mont  Icelanders where 290.490 wich makes 0,79% growth a year. On that pace we will be 300.000 late 2007!!!! YEAH GO ICELANDIC WOMEN  2. On the other hand 1.400.000 went through the internacional airport in 2003  3. For my imortal belowed Emerging Economies class it would be interesting that there was 84% working participant and something like 4% unemployment which we think is alot.  4. In last election on 10. of May 87,7% of the listed voted, that is I think more than the record in the US of A.  5. In 2003 there where sold 345 million cigarettes and 11,8 thousand cigars.  6. In my favorite part there where sold 350.000 liters of vodka and unspiced alcahol, 10.200.000 liters of beer and 1.050.000 liters of red wine.  7. An average person farts 14 a day... so each person, in the world, farted 5110 in 2003 so that makes 1.500.000.000 Icelandic farts in this very nice year... something to be proud of.  8. The average Icelander ate 53 kilos of sugar, the average Magnus and Vegard (Swedish and Norwiegan persons) ate 43 kilos and 33 kilos each Danish and Finnish person.  9. Average weight of an Icelandic 25 year old is 67,5 kilos and 74 of 55 year olds. The men on the other side do weight 81,7 kilos at 25 and 88 kilos at 55.  10. Acording to a survey made by Durex Icelanders are very happy with their sex life and the times an average Icelander had sex was 96 times.  11. In 2003 Icelanders sent close to 150 million sms´s which makes around 500 sms´s a person over the year.  Well now you must wiser so send me something to post!!!  Saludos, Úlli

      Hey people,  Ok this is Úlli, I have been wondering about how we can all stay in touch for the next few years coz I really dont want us to fade apart and how could we do that. It´s no doubt that some of us will keep in touch forever but Im worrying about those I knew but wherent my best friends and I bet some others feel the same way.  This I would say is a rather good solution, everybody who want to post something would contact me and I will give you permission on this page to post here or wich I would rather not do is that you would send me articles and I post them. If we are like 20 people we could have up to 3 posts a day and that would be fun!  Also I will add in a comment system so we can all "take a piss" at each other as Mr. Aziz would say.  The subject of the posts dont have to be about us or Barcelona or anything like that, you can talk about the last time you went to the bathroom, what you think about chinese food or just something out of the blue.  Anyways I hope I hear from many of y´all.  Still in missing, Úlli

And Ulli, do you piss on the plaza in iceland?  But i'm gonna enjoy the absinthe that tim got in that random country without a government.  Hope to see ya soon.  later.  Conor

      just kidding, I love and miss you all and I can´t describe how much I would like to be in Barcelona right now. Icelandic is really getting too cold for my taste - even though I guess that our friend Tim is probably colder.     Me and my class are going to the beautiful beaches of  Croatia for a graduation-trip in june so that is more or less what keeps me alive at the moment.   I tried power-joga for the first time last week and my muscles were sore for days. I am going again today and I can't wait!..... I enjoy torturing myself way too much :)   The second ad for auditions for my project comes on in the newspaper this sunday. We didn´t get sufficient response to the last one, but I am crossing my fingers for this one!  We have a new member in the team, the set and costume designer. She is really good and I am proud to have another talented person in my team.  Her latest project was Chicago - the musical, and her costumes have gotten a lot of attention (yes I know it doesn´t take a lot to get on the news in this tiny country, but still)  I am working right now...... or rather: I am in work right now. I have been here for an hour now and nobody has really showed up. That is the beauty of my workplace. You can show up anytime in the morning, you just have to be there before nine and work for 8 hours.  So I, who showed up at 7:45 can leave at 15:45! ..... I am not sure you find this interesting at all, but hey, I´ve got nothing else to say and nobody else is "blogging"   I hope you all have a good weekend with lots of booze and women,  Svana

      I just read Tims post and I just have to say that it was realy sweat (Im getting more American by the minute). For the last few weeks so many things have reminded me of you guys, for example just before I wrote this I watched a movie (Love Actually) which  I saw with one of you guys and I remember so many things about what we talked about, did and though before,after and in the middle of the film. Also I havent got anyother background on my computer than you guys and all the lovely (am I also getting more British by the minute) pictures Walker has posted. I cant wait to see you all again and I cant understand why there isnt anybody willing to pay for the plane tickets.  Hope I see you (in person) soon, Úlli  p.s. Note that I did put a link to the penguin game, just my version ;)    ... Try your luck now Timmy Tim

      I don't know if anyone has seen the new show on MTV, Surreal Life, featuring some of the randomest of randoms, but I was thinking about my time in Barcelona tonight, thinking of how surreal it now seems. The vast majority of the time my life goes smoothly along here at home, but a few times a day I get caught up thinking about Barcelona. The smallest thing often triggers it. Maybe I'll catch myself telling someone what Adam, Ulli, or Beatrice would say in a certain situation, or I'll think of looking out on the Mediterranean from the oh so conveniently perched Residencia. But regardless of what triggers thoughts of Barcelona, one thing is always the same...it never feels like I was actually there. All of my friends seem like very vivid characters from a movie, and if I can just think hard enough I know I'll remember the name of the movie. All of our stories seem like something I made up to amuse myself, like some delusional schizophrenic with a penchant for booze and late night clubbing. But when I stop and think, all of the best experiences in life seem surreal as they gradually fade, not entirely from the memory, but back into the corners of the mind from whence they emerge when summoned. And so, I thank each one of you for making my experience a little bit more surreal.  Tim

      Well I cant say Im doing like Tim, that is blogin drunk, but Im not to far from it.  Today I decided to go out with a few friends, I didnt plan on getting to drunk coz Im going out tomorrow night big time. Well so we went to the alcahol store and I bought Thule for tomorrow night and Corona for tonight, you know not to much alcahol and anyway you piss all the beer in just few moments.  Then after going to play football (inside nota bene), me and a friend of mine went to a schoolmate of ours and the forth guy, also a schoolmate, joined us a little later.  The plan was simple, whatch the Iceland Idol, behind the senes, then double American Idol, in the meanwhile get drunk and then go down town for further drinking and exploring Icelandic girls slutness.  Well first af all after two beer I decided on opening my bottle with a lemon in the same hand as I had the bottle, long story short I just manage to spill all the beer my jeans and my friends to and just well enough that it looks like we had both wet ourselfs.   After the Idol some vampire movie starring Aliyaa (I cant imagine how you write her name), came up and we started talking about something, when my phone starts ringing and it says that its my boss. I couldnt imagine why he was calling me at 10 minutes passed midnight at Fridaynight but I answered and he said anoyingly "arent you comin?". Well I just said yes and hang up, but I didnt have clue that I had to work, for all I knew I didnt have to show up until 4 in the afternoon on Sunday.  (one thing worthy of mentioning is that I work as kind of a segurity in Icelands biggest bank, I just sit for eight hours with another guy and walk around the house twice)  Well so I thought ok my breath smell like beer and most of all I smell like beer. So I loaned myself a shirt (I also managed to wet my shirt) did put far too much perfume right on my face and stole a gum pack. On the way I out called a taxi and asked it to go to the Bank. One thing I suddently missed from Barcelona are the taxi prices coz it costed something like eight Euros and I was in the taxi for something like 3 minutes.  I was lucky that my boss had already left and I dont think the other guy knows how beer smell like (honestly!). I have had alot of sleep to get this out of my sistem. I feeling rather frisky but almost like the hangover is coming soon!!!  Well just wanted share this with you, have I nice weekend, Úlli  Added later: Just one sad thing that I know that everyone is thinking about, well Icelands Handball team isnt doing so well coz they have lost both their matches and have big risk of falling out of the competition. I blame mostly bad referees and that the trainer doesnt have guts. For example we´ve got one of worlds best players and also one of worlds most promising player (that one plays for Barcelona). And if the best one is playing badly the coach doesnt take him of just plays him till the defence of the other team has beaten the crap out of him.    Well doesnt matter, Úlli

      Back in the computer lab in Building 1 Adam was waiting to bump into a familiar face, but it just wasnt happening!  Nobody appearing around a corner, no recognisable back of heads, nothing!  Rather weird to be back, went out last night to Cafe Royale and then Otto Zutz.  Left when they kicked us out and showed all the new kids in town my stunning moves on the floor.  I think thats why they arent really talking to me any more!  Wieteke has been busy fulfilling her role as social secretary and done a pretty good job.  She has picked out the best of the bunch for me and Steffen and so life will go on!  Anyone wanna visit, just let me know, until then,  A

      Hello everyone!....... or hello Úlli, Tim and Adam.  Just wanted to let you guys know that I love to hear about what is going on in your life's and I can tell you that it is a great way to survive a boring class with the help of wireless network and a laptop!  Because of the semester in Barcelona I have to take three extremely boring classes this semester and one that is ok.  It is about "Iceland and the EU" and almost only interesting because we are going on a trip to Brussels to take a look at the "headquarters" of EU. It will  be great to get to the continent again and if anyone reading this happens to be anywhere close to Brussels the 24th-29th of February, please let me know.  I am really busy these days, not only did school start of way too fast but things are getting really interesting with "my" musical.  I had a meeting today with a marketing company (the coolest and youngest one on the market : ) and they were really positive and want me to meet them again.   The premiere has been set for the 24th of October and will hopefully be shown until January, so if anybody wants to visit during that time, be sure to reserve two hours of your schedule to see it!  Well, that's about it for now.........

      Well, Adam, I think we are the only ones who check this site, and I'm hesitant to consider what that says about us. Today was my first day of classes, and my bastard teachers all decided to lecture for the full time. I don't know about your side of the drink, but traditionally here the first day of class is reserved for going over the syllabus, looking and feeling really bored, acting cool so that you get in with the cool kids on the first day (just like me, Adam, Lars, and Steffen in Spanish class), scoping the class for pretty faces, then getting the hell out of class at least 1/2 hour early. Maybe we've outgrown that phase, though. Well, maybe just the getting out of class early part. I've got one class with an annoying "friend" who I went to high school with. I've known him since we were 3, so I have to pretend to like him, but he really just annoys the shit out of me. We've had classes together before, and they've been brutal. Gonna be a long semester of me pretending to find his jokes amusing. That's the worst part...he's not funny.   I'm about to go make myself some hot dogs now, of the same quality Oscar Meyer variety that I brought to the cena internacional at Walker's. But no on wanted them at the cena...shame, shame. I'm making these ones Chicago-style. Yes, we have our own hot dog style, just like our own pizza style, and our own blues style. Basically, we have to put our name on everything we create lest New York or LA steal it and claim it as their own. Beware of coastal peoples (e.g. Ulli)...they're shade-errific. Take care.  Tim

      Boom shake the room!  Ulli, nice post, think you need to work on some of the spelling though, and I have a question for you......  What does tri-sexual mean?  Answers on a postcard.  Anywhooooo, I am returning to Barca on Thursday and without any of you lovely peeps I aint got that much to look forward to.  Obviously the passionate gay love sessions with Edagr will be a bonus and I always have Steffen to brighten up my day but I do hope that at least a few of you come back and surprise me, as there will always be a bed to stay in ( mine if your lucky ;op, not you Tim)  Is it me or is it just me, Tim and Ulli who check this thing?  I wanna see some more posts, some juicy gossip!!!!!!  Be good boys and girls, one love,  A

      Hey y´all  I might be surprised that Im not going to take any piss on Norway... for now. The reason Ali G if you are American and thinkin who tha fuck is Ali G then he is one of the funniest guys alive and has had a hit show in Uk, and all of Europe for some time now. Now he is also in America where HBO, I think, broadcasts the show. He has alsorts of funny caracters who he plays himself in particular Ali G the not so cleaver rapper wannabe. The reason Im telling you this coz I just found a Ali G translater where you can translate some words from regular English to Ali G´s verion. Here are few examples:  I Love You: me dig me Uncle Jamal England: Wales Scotland: Wales Girlfriend: Bidch Her: ha Queer Eye For the Straight Guy: Quea Eye fer da Straight Guy I have to be up in like 6 hours to drive my girlfriend to work: me ave to be up in dig 6 hours to drive me bitch to work Drunk food here is so much better than Bar Paris:  pissed grub in da house is so much betta 'dan Bar Paris  well me Uncle Jamal can see fer yourselves 'coz me did put up a link in da house on da right well you can see for yourselves because I did put up a link here on the right

      So, I must first of all apologize for anything that I might mistype, but I am pretty drunk right now. I went over to a friend's flat tonight and proceeded to show them pictures from Barcelona for about 2 hours. Needless to say, they got really tired of it after a while (they didn't know all the cool people after all). I thoroughly enjoyed Vegard's new pics though. Well done, China Boy. Don't get SARS. Heard it's dangerous or something like that. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the pics of me in Adam's "European" shirt from the night we went to Chupito's and Costa Breve. I couldn't find the pic of my shoes though...wonder why? ;)  Ulli, I'm glad you've given us such a lesson about music. I'm sure I'll appreciate it when I'm sober...whenever that may be. Svala is gorgeous by the way, so if her brother is anything near as hot, the band will be at least worth checking out (especially for Lee and Rodney). I watched "Queer Eye For the Straight Guy" the other day, this relatively new American show about 5 or so gay guys rearranging a straight guy's life. It's pretty fucking hilarious. They re-decorate his home, teach him how to cook, get him new clothes, teach him how to groom himself, etc. I didn't think I would like it, but it's really cool. Maybe it'll hit Europe soon, if we didn't copy it from Europe in the first place. Wouldn't surprise me since Europe seems to be much more liberal on issues concerning homosexuality. I'm just hoping I remember in the morning what exactly I typed tonight. I have to be up in like 6 hours to drive my girlfriend to work, but yet it feels like an early morning by BCN standards. I mean, it's barely 2 o'clock and I'm ready for bed. I'd probably be in bed if I hadn't gotten the idea to type this stupid blog. I feel a mad case of the munchies developing here. Time to go get something to eat. Drunk food here is so much better than Bar Paris. Thank goodness I don't have to eat those shitty, cold eggs on a bap anymore. But I've wasted enough of your lives. Goodnight one and all.  Tim

      Hey since Tim is so interest in languages I just had to put this  urlLink link  in   Other news is the weather witch has been so bad here that you cant even travel within the city now. I went down town earlier this evening, to watch the Idol finale, and on the way home I couldnt drive faster than 40 (kilometers/hour), wich is crazy. About the Idol thing, Kalli Bjarni won which almost translates to some cartoon Charlie something, I didnt realy like this competition because I didnt realy see what was so adorable about the contestants.  Recently I have heard a lot of great music, its been so great to hear good rock after all the college rock groups and the Korn stuff. My favorite has to be Hot Hot Heat which a rather funny kind of rock because they are so melodic, number two is  urlLink Minus  with their newest product Halldor Laxnes (named after our only nobel price winner).  The singer in that group is the son of Icelands all time most popular  urlLink poppstar  and brother of the very beautiful  urlLink Svala . The third one are british called The Darkness and are a glamrock band realy funy and energetic if you can find their video on kazaa then you should, it so funny.   Also another band I kinda like is More-Sheep-ahhhhh and as the name suggests they are British. Adam suggested them to me and they are pretty fine, very calme and generally good.  Hope my house will stay up tonight, Úlli

      Well, I'm trying very hard to get situated in this apartment, but between being terribly lazy and going out to party, it's slow going. I got the computer set up first thing, and now that I have access to the internet, it's going to be hopeless getting anything done. I just know Vegard is going to find himself a Chinese hottie and settle down in Nanching, never to return to the land of the midnight sun. Well, either a hottie or a dominatrix, a la Lucy Liu. It's getting right down to crunch time for me--next term begins on Tuesday. Weather's been great here, with sunny days and temps hovering around 0 Celsius. Not bad for January at all. So, as you've probably noticed, I haven't gotten around to posting my pictures on Walker's nifty website yet. And I've got such quality shots of Adam's mullet.   And now a little think piece for you. I was just pondering how strange it is what words in the English language were Latin-ized (Ulli, this doesn't count as making up a word) following the Norman invasion (by the way, the Normans were originally from Norway...those Vikings sure got around) and what words still maintain their Germanic roots. For instance, our names for the colors are not Latin at all, nor are our numbers. One would think such key words would be among the first to change. But I suppose if you really get down to it, maybe the words that the poor, English-speaking masses used on a daily basis were a bit harder for the Normans to change, while the elements of language used mainly by the educated were among the first to change. Even today it is really only highly educated English speakers who rely heavily on words and phrases borrowed from French. Or maybe that's absolute bubkus. Just something to ruminate over. Tune in next time for more interesting linguistic discussions. J/K...you'll have to excuse the former linguistics major for his hapless forays into the linguistic universe. Ta ta for now.  Tim

      Helluv everyone!  I'm kind of new to this blog-thing, but you bet I'm plugged in. Cool to read all your fascinating everyday-stories. Special thanks goes to Tim and Ulli who both made me laugh very loud in this damned quiet norwegian PC-lab. In a PC-lab in Norway one is not supposed to talk or laugh, so everyone turned around and looked at me like if I was some kind of retard...   Yep yep, I hope everybody is still doing fine out there. As Ulli just announced, I'm going to China this sunday. It was kind of a funny story, because two weeks ago I got a phone call from a friend who is working there asking me whether I wanted to join him as an english teacher at Nanchang University in China. I thought aboout it for one day, because it would radically mess up all my career  plans, but the day after I called him and said: "Hell yeah, I'm going!" I considered it a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I would regret my whole life if I didn't accept.   So now I try to get all the official papers in order before I leave to China next sunday. We're gonna go on holidays to a small island in the South-China Sea for 14 days before we head back to Nanchang and start teaching. I'm gonna be in charge of the oral english-classes, which means I have to try to get shy chineese girls and guys into talking english. It's gonna be quite a challenge but I hope that with great entusiasm and humour I can make it work. (do chineese have humour??)   I'll let you know how things are going when I come down to the land of the yellow people. Until then, keep writing folks! Love to hear from ya all...   Bye from the endless chilly rain in Bergen,    Vegard

      Hey I just got a mail from Vegard (Veigar from here on) and he told me that he isnt going back to school but rather hes going to China to work as an English teacher. Me, and Svana, think its a great idea and nobody should leave an oportunity like this unnoticied. I personally would leave in a heart beat.  He will be leaving Norway on Sunday to Nanching which is on the south-east side of the country but not that close to sea.  Offcourse I offered Veigar to post some news of his travels on this great page but we have to see how well plugged he is.  I also heard from Edgar who had his first day of the second semester in Esade but school began yesterday, on monday, he told me that it was rather lonely now that we the great people have gone.  It wont be longer at this time.  Cheers to Veigar, Úlli

      Okay that's it, I am in love, just wanted to tell all the guys who already kindda knew about it...and all the others! Dumped the girl for me. I am in love. Gracias a Barcelona where we made it for the first time ;) . Gracias a Barcelona who gave me the courage (and the alcohol) to jump on him. At last.  Gracias at that boy who waited for me 3 yrs (yes...). I am in love when I thought everything was over... I ll always remember our first kiss on Passeig de Gracia... Calls me sweetheart, honey and all the stuff, and i dont even think it s stupid! VIVA BARCELONA (and the crazyness it gave me)...

      Ulli, I'm glad you mentioned the Icelandic songs. I was listening the other day to that CD of Icelandic songs you gave me. Some good stuff on there, and Icelandic cowboy was a hit with my best friend. As for the Idol craze, I have watched American Idol a few times and World Idol once, but I find myself inexplicably nackered (spelling?) about 20 seconds into the show. World Idol is a bit better because you can cheer for a particular country. The chubby Norwegian fella that sang like Bono impressed me, but he needs some serious dental work...I thought he was English at first.  Simon would have ripped him a new one for that.   Well, I went bar-hopping last night. I borrowed an ID from someone who was borrowing it from someone(since little Timmy is still not of age here in the US) and made the rounds. Even managed to find an Irish pub, though the music was shit. I went to an Irish pub for lunch the other day and my waiter was Mexican. I was a bit peeved since we were the only people in the place for lunch, and there were 2 perfectly Irish waiters sitting on their asses, but no, we get the Mexican. And the worst was he was trying to pull off some Irish accent, when it was quite obvious he didn't get that tan on Ireland's sunny shores. When we finished, he asked if we were done, and when we said yes, he said "No mas?" While it reminded me of Barcelona, I nevertheless thought "I would've gone to a Mexican restaurant if I wanted a taste of Mexico." I suppose I should get used to it with Bush's wonderful new immigration plan...don't even get me started. Basically, "Hey, let's encourage illegal immigration." Another brilliant idea from Georgie. New book out, "American Dynasty" or some such, about the Bush clan. Looks to be decent for any interested. Might well be shit, but I automatically grant it some merit since it bashes the Bush dynasty.  Hung out last night with a friend who was in Ireland with me. It was good to reminisce, but hearing her talk so much about Ireland made me realize how much fun I had in Barcelona. Barcelona is by far the more vivid in my mind, and I don't think that's just because it is the most recent. I truly think it's because of the people I was with in BCN. Thanks again to all. I head down to school this Wednesday for Conor's 21st birthday, the same Conor that visited me in BCN. I've got a little absinthe from Andorra up my sleeve. Hopefully there are no fatalities.  Well, Adam and Ulli will be happy to know that I finally got my first cell phone of my own. Well, I guess it's not really my own, but pretty much. My girlfriend's mom bought it but doesn't like it, so she's giving it to me, along with the contract. It's the Sony-Ericsson camera phone...got it for free, so that ain't bad. I will no longer force people to be my phone pimps, a la Ulli. (But Ulli, I would highly recommend your services to others, along with your banking services). I hear Adam's raking in the dough...assume it's the same for others. Myself, I'm just a big bum, living off the state. The welfare and food stamps should arrive any day now.   I find myself hopelessly lost on some points of Americana upon my return. I'm absolutely clueless as to what's been going on in American football and the NBA, so people try to make conversation and I stare at them like some big, dumb oaf. "Must've missed that game," I mutter. Going through a bit of mullet withdrawal here at home, as that whole fad is quarantined to tiny holdout factions of Def Leppard fans in the Deep South (ask Constance for confirmation). But when I really miss mullets, I just look at pictures of Adam's last haircut. Would've been better off with a bowl, Adam.   I was excited to see at the latest national car show that the major car companies are all unveiling their new lines of gas-electric hybrid cars. Maybe if we buy enough of them, Georgie will cease meddling in the Middle East. Liberating the Iraqi people, my ass. Three letters for ya....O-I-L....period. I think that's how it's spelled. But that's enough political rambling on my part. A Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

      Funny thing the minute I entered blogger.com Tims favorite song came in the radio "Hiroshima" the one that has the corus " you will all, you will all, you will all diiiiieeee, and then the same but instead of die there is burn. But enough of that but still in a related subject Im getting rather anoyed that everybody is talking about Idol which every country has had ther version of (Pop Idol in the UK and American Idol in US). Ive seen it once and it kind of sucks first of all the most popular one sucks, the only hot girl got woted out the last time. The fifth one (that will be thrown out tonight) only sings slow romantic songs which is ok but he sometimes just takes fast paced songs and slows them down until you run away crying your eyes out. If somebody remembers the guy in was always singing in front of Cafe Zurich (I know I write it wrong) then its not that bad the same feeling just not as strong.  Now everybody is watching this show exept me, Im working. The reason why these two subjects are a bit related  is that the goy who sang "Hiroshima" is Icelandic Idols Simon, the person everybody loves to hate. He is an admirable person cause he had Icelands best selling album for 15 years staight (different album each year hes not our Bill and Ted).  I just finished writing my beloved Seema a Email and was telling her about somethings that are so strange. For example I had some funny feeling that something was not as usual today I found it out around at noon that my wallet was in the back pocket where it hadnt been since I first came to Barcelona and was adviced to put in the front pocket.  The other thing which doesnt put me off but is still strange, when I take the elevator at school and am going down Im always waiting for the floor number zero to come up on little screen.    Tomorrow Im going to babysit my favorite cousins two boys 3 and 5 years they are so adorable, always playing and saying jokes, Im realy looking forward to it. These boys are so good friends and so alive they sometimes fight but at the end of the day they are always best friends.  Well I dont appetite for more writing so...   hasta la proxima, Ingi/Úlli

      Hey people... My first blog ouaouh!! Just to tell you we had a party at my school yesterday, as they do it : free alcohol all night long, Tim : you'd have liked it! Good to see the old friends from school back, but missing the hot atmosphere of the tiny crazy bars...the wandering in the streets... Well some boys helped make up for it and it worked quite well...for a moment ;)

      Well, my best friend took off this morning to return to the frozen tundra that is North Dakota this time of year. They're expecting actual temps of -24 Celsius today (-31 Celsius with windchill factor). But that's North Dakota...it's a balmy -19 Celsius at my house right now. So, basically it's cold. But enough about the weather. It's just depressing.  I assume everyone got royally smashed on New Year's. I didn't because the party ran out of beer...apparently a CEMS student planned the party (I kid, I kid). But this past week a friend got me and my girlfriend free tickets to a Chicago Bulls game, and while Jordan is no longer in Chicago, $85 tickets in the second row right behind the Bulls' bench still helped to soothe any residual pain from New Year's. While at the game, a friend posed an interesting question: at what point do you switch from "X years old" to "X years young." I don't know if this is only an American thing, but oftentimes you will hear an announcement that Granny Smith or some such is 90 years YOUNG today. I consider myself 20 years OLD. So at what age does the switch occur? Just a curiosity of the language, perhaps. Perhaps the question is a waste of your time, but you'll have to forgive me. You see, it's really not my fault. Ulli's friend commented that I was quite the pen, and now I've gotten quite a big head and think I can type whatever I want in this space. Now I know you all have better things to do than check this blog (stop laughing), so forgive me for wasting your time. The last thing we want is another monumental time-waster like Emerging Economies. But I must practice lest my writing skills become under-der-vey-lo-ped (yeah Puig!).   I must say that, other than my friends, I miss the good football most about Barcelona. My girlfriend gets the Premiership, but on a premium channel at like 3 in the morning on Sunday morning, or something ridiculous like that. And watching football with your girlfriend, who could care less, at 3 am is no Scobie's. But at least we agree that footballers are hot (as a former youth footballer, I feel it is absolutely necessary to promote this stereotype to the fullest of my ability).  But alas, your eyes tire and your minds wander, so until next time......   Hasta la pasta, Timmy Tim Tims

      Hey people,  I just got a mail from Beatrice and she wantes to join the writers team so this is getting to be a pretty big group, Im also talking to Constance right now and our negotiations are going well.  My new years was pretty good I spent the begining of the evening with my family but after midnight I went to another town close by (an hour driving) where my best friend lives, we started drinking at his place and then moved on to one of his friends where there were alot of young but pretty girls, which I consider to be a good thing. I kissed to many girls in my opinion but who gets enough of kissing? The night ended on a couch at my friends place and I wasnt alone;)  The day after we went to see Lord of the Rings in a VIP room (if you dont know what that is then its like a regular movie theater where you pay double the entrance but sit in a Lazy Boy and get all the pop corn and all the coke you can drink). I definatly think the VIP thing was worth it coz the movie is almost 4 hours, we went at midnight and came out short before 4.   On Saturday I went to my cousins wedding and I had the job of being her photographer which is harder than it sounds for example I was trying to take a picture of the wedding waltz I took like 7 pictures but all I got was their backs ( the camera is rather slow).  Later me and some of my cousins went down town where I got phone numbers of two girls one I realy like but the number of the other one Im gonna lose. Actually I just came few hours ago from our first date it was pretty nice but I dont know if it will work out.   Thats enough of my life, Ingi/Úlli

      Úlli: Me Júlli: My friend from school Ragga: Júllis girlfriend  Júlli: Úlli did somebody cum in the elevador Úlli: What Where? Júlli: Yes in the bar on Hotel Iceland on friday. Úlli: Really who? Or should I say what? Júlli:  Yeah Ragga told me you told her!?!?  Ok so on friday we went to a so called uncertainty trip which is just a trip where you get drunk but you dont know where, before hand. So we waited in some bus for half an hour longer than we should have and then took a tourist trip around the city (interesting... NO). After that 45 minute trip with beer in our hand we went to play bowling it wasnt that great I got a 100 and the winner got something like 175 but he used to be in the national team.  Afterwards we didnt want to go directly to the party at Hotel Iceland so we went one of my mates garage which has six darts (things), one pool table, bar and everything is decoraded in newspaper articles my mates father in law. He played for KR their first European cup game against Liverpool (one of Englands biggest football team and Adams favorite(beside that they suck)) but they where also playing their first game so its pretty historical.  Then we chatted about one night stands but I have become a little famous coz one of my  urlLink Icelandic blogs  ended on Icelands second most popular webside. I got hundreds and thousands of visits that day:( Anyway, one of Daði´s friends brought another guy who wasnt the brightest nor the funnest but ok. That guy (I dont know his name but we call him Office One coz' he works there) said that one night stands were like co-masturbation... you know, no love and that shit. Ok so we went to this school party at Hotel Iceland where some stuff happend among others we starded playing with some plastic fruits and throwing them at each other, one guy took it a little bit too seriously and threw it... straight at my eye, I thought I would get a black eye!!!  Anyway this office one fella' was hitting on everything that moved and finally he started hitting on Ragga but since she had gotten tired of this fella she was thinking about going somewhere with him where they would get cought and he would be thrown out. (ok a little time-out in this place it is in the cellar but on the other floors there is this hotel and you can take elevadors up). We warned her and I told her this masturbation BS but she had masterplan obviously. So somehow the day after when she got sober she mixed our conversation up and all of sudden somebody did cum in the elevador. That has been the joke of the week among my friends. I have a feeling that this story doesnt translate well... anyway.  While writing this I have been uploading some pictures from Iceland which I took most of today... from a moving car. You can sometimes see my face in the car mirror. I named some of the photos so they will be understandable, but some wont even be understandable with a text. Anyway enjoy. Also I did put two pictures of my hair in the back.  Úlli  p.s. Im looking for top 250 reasons not to go to Illinois so if you have any ideas send me a mail at ingiulfar@ru.is or contact me at msn ingiulfar@hotmail.com

      For those of you who are wondering why Bill Gates would stop at Illinois before traveling on to Carnegie-Mellon, MIT, Cornell, and Harvard, here are a few reasons why he came here (and why you should come here too):  -Microsoft hires more employees from Illinois than from any other university -Tim French goes to school at Illinois -Illinois is a fun word to pronounce -orange and blue are great school colors (if you're not colorblind) -did I mention that Tim French goes to Illinois? -there is a low Icelandic population, so moms are safe from young men here -bowl cuts are available here -mullets are NOT available here (sorry Adam and Steffen)  Alright, so while the first reason is probably the only reason Bill Gates came here, you should all consider a visit to the Illinois prairie. I have spoken my piece.  Tim

      Billy Boy Gates stopped by my uni last night for a talk to computer science and engineering majors. Out of the 1400 seats, the business college got only 18 seats. That's a load of crap in my opinion. But it was kinda cool to have the world's richest man a block away. One of my friends worked the event, so I'll have to get all the dirt on Bill and disseminate it around the globe. Y'all can be my international lackeys in this diabolical scheme. Ahh, too early to be doing homework already....so tired...must sleep.

      Dame un P, Dame un E, Dame un R, Dame un UUUUUU  PERU! PERU! PERU!  yup, went and saw them almost embarrass Spain in Montjuic on yesterday, cracking goal put them one up but then the boring Spaniards finally put a couple of chances in the back of the net!  Stadium was almost empty and there were probly more Peruvian fans than Spanish (apart from the Nazi skinheads that Edgar sat next too, apparently thats what you get when you pay more for your ticket!), but the atmosphere was wicked as we sat right next to them and their big drum!  Had some friends from Madrid down on Saturday and tried our best to show them the sights and sounds of Barca, Steffen got rather drunk and begun to cross dress but luckily stopped at shoes!  Lovely photos to follow!  Looks like we might be goin to Karnaval in Sitges this weekend, thinking of what to dress up as,  any ideas?????  Got a call from Constance yesterday whilst we were at the footie, she saw ETA on the telly and heard Catalunya and thought we might all have been fried by some dirty bomb but we ok!  She seems to be doin well and by the sounds of it maquina hasnt corrupted the dancefloors of Madrid yet (lucky bastards!)  so tink I might find my way up there to rip up a dancefloor or two!  Tim - what particular idiot gets a bloody job that pays peanuts to afford a trip back to Barca and then gets told, by his BOSS!!!! that because of work commitments he cant get the time off!  Lay down the law Timmy boy, show him whos boss!  I want your arse here in March and thats my last word on the subject!  Walker - nice bird in the photo big man, got any goss, go on, make it explicit like Ulii ;op  Until the next time, sleep tight boys and girls, TTFN,  A

      Well, tonight is just one of those nights where I'm really missing Barcelona and all of my friends. I suppose any place begins to feel like home after a while, but I was blessed with some of the greatest friends anyone could ask for to share a trip with. Sorry to wax all emotional on you guys, but I feel so far removed from not only Barcelona, but from Europe in general and all you guys. I heard from Vegard, and he's loving it in the land of Yao Ming. He reads the blog whenever Ulli sends it his way. Hope to see more new faces on here soon. Sorry I couldn't think of anything clever to say tonight...first time for everything.   Missin everyone, Tim

      Ok my week has been pretty good, thanks for asking, but yet very interesting in a strange way.  We didnt have to many projects this week so after our markstrat session on thursday we went to watch the elections in Iceland University, which realy do suck but they have cheap beer :) The reason why they suck is that they have all the same goals its almost like the same party, historically one is a right wing party and the other one left so in the right one those who want to become right wing poltitians go there and others on the other side. My best friend when I was nine was the right wing candidate so I supported them a little more but honestly didnt give  fuck. I only ment to drink a couple of beers but ended up going to this party and at around 5 in the morning me and an old friend went to share a cap. When we came to my place the friend came with me so I thought he wanted stay over so I went to pick up a sleeping bag and such, but when we came inside he started hitting on me seriously which I didnt like. The problem ofcourse is that my friend is a he... like Manolo said "my ass is a one way street".  I didnt show up for school on Friday because of hangover but managed to do one thing that day, play football, I sucked big time but ce la vie.  On Saturday I went to my schools football competition where made only one draw in three matches but it was fun. Later that night I went to a party at one of my teammates and we all got drunk (we were like 15 of us). It was a load of fun especially the drinking game which I recorded and may even send all of ya copy, pretty funny. Afterward we went downtown and in the end I managed to find a place to stay for the night, the only thing I had to do is help the girl with some "workout" that same night:) A good deal.  I came home at 13 the day after and watch 3 football matches during that day. The most enjoyable was Barcelona-Atletico which Barca won 3-1:) We are now in a champion league position:)  I think this is it for now but I did sign Manolo up after meeting him on MSN (Kat and Seems hrm...hrm..) but he hasnt accepted yet.  Well later, Úlli

      Good to hear from Kat...apparently Texas didn't change much while you were gone. Hopefully we will be sending George W. back to your great state shortly...John Kerry's been my boy from the get-go. But I'd best move on before I start a political feud on this blog. Started work last week at a bank (following in Ulli's footsteps). I, however, don't clean toilets and shoot intruders. I get to stand behind the counter, pretend like I know what I'm doing, and give people ridiculous sums of cash. Guy the other day wanted $8000, and then some woman came in wanting $3. We serve all sorts, I guess. This lady is convinced the police have her entire home bugged. I survived Valentine's Day with minimal damage...some flowers, dinner at my girlfriend's hall, a trip to Blockbuster to rent The Hours. Cheap evening all in all. Wrote in to the school paper about my trip home in October for this Stupid or Cupid contest and won second prize in the Cupid category. I think if I had included the reason for the trip I could've won both Stupid and Cupid prizes. Was planning a trip to BCN in March, but me boss told me to dream on. The whole reason I got the job was to pay for the trip to BCN, and now it's the job that's keeping me from going. Good to see that Ulli has taken to posting warm fuzzy forwards on the blog now. Guess he got tired of the penguin game. Well, off to do homework now...don't remember doing much of that last semester. Bye kids.  Tim

      The following scene took place on a BA flight between Johannesburg and  London.   A white woman, about 50 years old, was seated next to a black man.  Obviously disturbed by this, she called the air Hostess. "Madam, what is the matter"?, the hostess asked.  "You obviously do not see it then"?, she responded. "You placed me next to a black man. I do not agree to sit next to someone from such a repugnant group.  Give me an alternative seat".   "Be calm please", the hostess replied. "Almost all the places on this flight are taken. I will go to see if another place is available".   The Hostess went away and then came back a few minutes later. "Madam, just as I thought, there are no other available seats in the economy class. I spoke to the captain and he informed me that there is also no seat in the business class. All the same, we still have one place in the first class".    Before the woman could say anything, the hostess continued. "It is not usual for our company to permit someone from the economy class to sit in the first class However, given the circumstances, the captain feels that it would be scandalous to make someone sit next to someone sooooo disgusting".   She turned to the black guy, and said. "Therefore, Sir, if you would like to, please take your hand luggage because a seat awaits you in the first  class".   At the moment, the other passengers who were shocked by what they had just witnessed stood up and applauded.   This is a true story which is not usually told. If you are against racism, please send this message to all your friends, please do not delete it  without sending it to at least one person.

      ........can break bones but words will still never hurt anyone, which must be considered a good thing!  So, ho!  Another week on, another week wiser, and guess what I learnt to do this week?  What I hear you ask, come on Adam tell us!  Snowboarding I say!  Yes, I went snowboarding this weekend (the title may have given this away!), for the first time and quite possibly the last!  We were not amazingly well prepared for it, three hours sleep after an outing with mainly CEMS peeps on Friday (an introduction to Mas i Mas, which for some reason didnt go down to well, worrying huh?!?) left me and Steffen short of energy and the three hour train jouney up to La Mollina was hardly comfortable, crammed together on the floor like refugees was less than cosy!  Anywayz, via a bus connection we finally got to the resort which was gorgeous and I was bullied into goin snowboarding as otherwise I would be the odd one out :o(  so I collapsed and allowed myself to be punished for that stupid, stupid decision for the next 4 hours!  Steffen has some great photos of me flat on my face which I am sure you will all enjoy and I will try and get him to put them up on the website.  Talking about photos and websites I have put all the ones I have taken in the last couple of weeks and they are now sitting pretty on Walker's website ready for you guys so that you can see what the new folk look like and double check that I look as good as I did ;op  Snowboarding was actually quite good fun, by the end of the day I could even pick up some speed and turn and shit, though this inevitably just meant that the falls were harder and hurt a lot more!  A seat on the ride home did my bruised behind no end of help and brunch at La Fianna yesterday and a couple of pints in an Irish pub (spoke to Noel, Tim) completed the recovery process.  Apart from that the last week has been fairly quiet, more exchange students have arrived and I think everyone is here now, I still have a five day weekend so lots of time to do nothing really!  Shame about all you guys who have work to do, ha ha!  Sun is shining and all I can say is, bring it on!  Hasta luego tios y tias,  A

      First of all I realy like to say Im sorry to Adam, you realy do have bad haircut but I had no rights to critisice it and well its your choice, ok?  Second, I went on Friday to get a haircut the thing was that I hadnt gone to do so since BCN and I did need one. Coz' it was that day all the places were busy exept for this one fancy place. So I went there and asked to, you know, get it short on the sides, a little in the back and some on the top, and get color as I had in Spain and thats it. Well so me and the, very beautiful, hairdresser had some rather "emparesing" talk until I started feeling like she was giving me mullet so I said, you know I don't like the mullets. She replies that there were good and bad ones, and then we had a lifely conversation about bad haircuts in Iberia (Spain & Portugal) as we all sure have gotten to know. Well when she finished I thought I had a little pony tale but I wasnt that worried, just thought it was funny, she told me that on the back of my head it was most (hair) in the center (of the back of my head). Well no trouble, just something fancy...  ITS A MULLET, seriously I have been checking it out and its a fact!!! I have mullet. Ok, so I should just take some scissors and cut it myself, right? No, wrong coz' even though its horrable I have never in my life been so popular with the girls. I told you about my luck, on Friday and on Saturday my friend asked me to teach him how to hussle (like Im the master) and coz' he's the worst I went with him to help a little. We decided to start in this bar, where his friends go, but they weren't there, we just sat down and he had a little (actually alot) to drink and we chatted. Then this girl points me over (and she was cute, though her friend wasnt) I offcourse went. Well she told me that I was her "prince of dreams" and thats how she would like her husband (her actual words there and then). I thought I was getting lucky so I asked her how old she was, what she did and so on. Ok Tim don't laugh too hard, she was a 27 year old dentist assistant with husband and two kids, thats where I put the line. Then she and her friend realy liked to armwrestle me!!! Whats up with that???  There are more stories to this night, but I havnt got time to writ'em.  Later, Úlli

      Well, Ingi's marketing efforts have paid off :)    I'm so glad to get to talk to y'all again.  Being back in Texas is almost like I never left-- like life kept moving and I was ushered back in without missing a step.  Everything seems the same, only I feel different.  I can't really put my finger on it, but I just look at things differently.  For example, I was at the grocery store the other day and I was amazed that everything-- I mean everything-- you find is low-fat, fat-free, low-carb, atkins friendly-- it is ridiculous.  America is pretty big on fad-dieting and the latest is the Atkins low carbohydrate diet.  Subway sandwiches even made a new wrap that is "atkins friendly."  Am I the only one who thinks this is crazy?!  I know this is a silly example, but I guess i just have a new perspective on a lot of different things.    I have a bunch of International students in my International trade class, and it reminded me of the classes back in Barcelona; I was half expecting Magnus to comment on something, or Tim and Adam to start making fun of me (aka "taking the piss").  Actually, there are 2 ESADE students in that class on exchange-- so there's a little Spanish flavor (not flavour) in the place!    What have I been doing since I've been back?  A ton of COUNTRY DANCING!!  Imagine Adam dancing at one of the Barcelona clubs and multipy that by 10-- that's me when I go dance at Midnight Rodeo.  No...  not an actual rodeo with bull-riding and cattle-roping, just a club/bar that I go to every thursday.  Let's see, I turned the big 21 a few weeks ago so I can finally drink legally in the United States.  I kicked off the event by going downtown the night before my birthday at midnight to get all sorts of free stuff-- free shot at every bar, free t-shirts, etc.  Well, after a night full of dancing on bars, body shots, hugging lots of random people, and singing/yelling down the streets, my friends carried me back to my room.  The next day I was back-- getting a free, very potent, Mexican martini at a place called Trudy's (kind of a right of passage for University of TX students).  So, all in all, it was a great birthday.    Now, however, it's back to the grindstone.  I have three exams next week and some internship interviews... YIKES.  Amidst the hecticness of my life, I find myself thinking about the carefree days of Barcelona and all of the friends I met there.  Luckily Seema is here so I know everything wasn't a dream or some crazy acid trip.  It's nice to be able to share memories of our friends in Barcelona.  I miss you all, and I hope to hear from you soon.  P.S.  Share some of the snow!!! We're having pretty mild weather, sunny, and blue skies-- it's supposed to be winter... not spring

      Hey i think its time for my weeks update which has been fairly busy.  On Saturday my parents went to Italy to ski, I was hoping for a wild week and even though I wasnt home alone I did think that I would have a good time since I the oldest and can beat my siblings up if I want the remote control. But no the teachers decided to ask us for 7 projects in the same week and 4 of those in the same subject! We were very anoyed by one of those coz' we had to ask 30 people what were the first three things that came to mind when some brand was mentioned. We figured this had little if anything to do with our marketing studies but the teacher is making her on research on that subject so it was very handy to get us to do all the hard work. Anyway I stayed in the school all day for that week and only once I came home to eat, so Im just glad its over.  I was pretty certain I would have to go out on friday coz' just to have some good time this week so I signed up for the sience trip on Friday. In this one we went to Iceland Express which is similar to Ryanair but only flies from Iceland to Denmark and England. They had a lecture on the company for half an hour maybe more and gave free beer while talking, usually they give free bear during the lecture and then for an hour afterwards but they didnt have enough so we had to start buying right after which sucked. I once again had to play the drunk Icelander and got completely out of hand, hit on a exchange student (you have to be friendly) and then went home with some girl which was a huge waste of money. the worst sex ever and cap expenses were in total something like 50 $. Today I went to play football, it was surely a hangover ball coz' I didnt have the strength to run after anything so i just stayed in goal and passed the ball up the field.  My dad just bought the sport channel for one month (not the actual channell) so Ive watch some football on tv, on Wednesday I watched Man City against Tottenham coz' Icelands national keeper just signed for the prior and played the match. It was a great match coz' Tottenham were 3-0 nil up at halftime and at halftime one City player got redcarded. So there wasnt much hope, but the match ended 4-3 and Arni Gautur had an outstanding match, Schmeichel said he had the save of the season so he did pretty well.  Thats it for now.  Later, Úlli  p.s. I just signed up Kat so I hope she will start bloging soon.

      I know it's been a while since I've posted anything, so I thought I'd better get something up lest you guys think Illinois had slid off the face of the earth. Been busy with school and other activities here, trying to stay caught up, but I've done my fair share of going out. However, it's not quite as carefree as Barcelona, where I really had no responsibilities and no one to answer to. Murphy's Pub isn't quite the same as a real Irish pub, but it's still good to be at the pubs at home. Went to this bar last night that usually only 1st years frequent. We used to be big fans, but the massive urine lake on the floor eventually drove us away. But last night we ventured back, and I must say that Adam, Ulli, and Walker would've thoroughly enjoyed it. The number of fit girls in the crowd was unreal....quite enough to go around with you boys. The evening ended with a gaggle of girls dancing on the bar and two girls making out with each other hardcore on the bar. I got in trouble with the gf for looking, but such is life. Just got a job actually...like Ulli, I will be a bank employee, but as a teller. Can't help but feel somewhat like Banks in Mary Poppins.   Walker, I totally know what you mean about the strangeness of running into people. Since I've been back I've run into so many people I was in Ireland or Spain with. Chilled at the bar with Nim a bit the other night--cracked a few Jewish jokes. I now give Nate rides to school in the morning since he lives across the courtyard. Just kinda take it all with a grain of salt. Adam, I hope you survive the ravages of the Barcelona night life. I'm just trying to survive the wicked snow and ice that won't stop coming. Take care, all.  Tim

      so long since ive heard the sound of the metro.  we have a skytrain here in Vancouver, but its not the same..  its a kind of three tone bing-biiiing-bong... sheer caucophony compared to the sublime happy-go luckiness of that guy who says: tarrrrrrragonnna.  But i will have to cope.   Sooo, whats new.  i dunno.  the other day, I was put in this group with a girl on exchange, so i ask where she is from, holland.  oh, from rotterdam? yea.  Oh, do you know wieteke? oh, of course.  maybe its normal over there in europe, what with all your inbred erasmusness, but it was quite a surprise for me here in Canada.  So, I undertook it as my civic responsibility to show her around the city.   I went out with all her exchange student friends and... lets just say you are lucky you didnt come here on exchange, haha, they all seem like losers. except for a few of course.  but it made me think how lucky we were to have such a great group of people.  really.   I wonder what the current batch of girrie cookies look like now.  Adam - eagerly awaiting pictures.  Everyone else, by the way, please put up some fotos from your home country, It would be great to see where everyone comes from.  If you want to its pretty easy, just send me an email for instructions.    Well folks. hoped you were all thoroughly bored by my post.  i dont know, there is something kinda theraputic about this isnt there?  anyways, gotts ta go, see you later amigos  Walker

      People its my week update and it(the week) hasnt been very interesting. One thought to begin with, I just watched Simple Life with Paris Hilton and I just have to ask in anyone realy amazed that people around the world think that Americans are stupid. For legal reasons I would like to point out that I dont think that Americans are stupid I just understand why one would think so. Anyway Paris Hilton is the daughter of one of the ritchest guys living and one would guess that he could afford decent education apperantly not. Miss Hilton didnt know what a well was or what you did do with it. She didnt have a clue what wal-mart was, not even it was a mall or a store.  About my week, I have been sick most of it and just spent my time watching downloaded movies (loved Bloody Sunday (shame in Brits) and Average Joe) and slept, not very interesting. On Friday I reconed that I was regaining my health so i went to a science trip with my school to IMG Gallup whitch wasnt the best one coz' the guy who was introducing the company did talk for over an hour and in the end over half the people had left, including me. The Students then chatted for something like an hour while drinking free beer (the only reason we came). Afterwards  we went to, I guess, the hottest bar in the city Herfisbarinn (could be translated as the Local). Where we got more free beer and everybody were on track to get wasted (Icelandic style;). Me and Svana did have serious chat about Adams hair, not realy but we talked quite a bit about our experience and other stuff then everybody went to the dancefloor. About an hour later (around 2-3) I called one of my friend, who had gone to see other friends, but he was home, another friend was barely alive, for to much alcahol, since he was with his girlfriend I decided to leave and went to other bars but with little success, so I called a friend who had offered to pick me up we went to eat some drunk food which is so much better than BCN. Tim when you come here Ill introduce you to BSI´s pizzasandwich, just classic.   The morning after me parents left for Italy where they are on a skiing trip but I still spent most of my time watching football and didnt realy do anything thing until 1:30 in the morning when I went to pick up my drunk friend and then another and finally somegirls asked me if I could drive them home which I did.  At 5 I came home and went to sleep and just woke up at 13 to see "boltinn með Guðna Bergs" which is the best program in Iceland and its about football:) after that I watched Chelsea win Blackburn in fun game and went to work. When I came I just felt sick and have had a headace al the shift, since Im off in like 20 minutes and i think I just might watch Super Bowl not that I like anythin' about it just dont think Ill fall a sleep.  Next week will be difficult coz' we've got 7 projects to hand in, that most definatly means that Ill have to get drunk on Friday but man's got to do what man's got to do.  Úlli

      I was fucked, seriously knackered, seven days of hardcore socialising has resulted in me losing the will to drink.  I was shocked, a shiver ran down my spine, what was the world coming to if I could not bring myself to even sip on the Vodka Redbull that was in my hands?!?  It has been a cracking week here in Barca, bit of Oveja Negra on Monday and then onto Models Night at Bar-Salona on the Tuesday.  Managed to get ourselves a table, survived the dodgy Arabian music and then felt like 100% party pimps for the rest of the evening.  Waltzed on down to see Tom Cruise strut his stuff in Japan with Edgar and Steffen on the Wedsnesday, having been sufficiently amazed at his ability to pick Japanese up, off the cuff, in a couple of months decided that if Tom can do it so can anyone (will be going to Japan in the summer ;op).  Thursday was Weiteke's last night, a lounge at Carpe Diem was booked and bedded revelry did take place, VIP'd it until they kicked us out and then moved on to Club Sutton.  Met up with a some CEMS people and ended up at Bar Paris, guaranteed!  Friday, me and Steffen went all out, trying to educate the newcomers, so with a bit of a forsnizzle we moved onto the delights of Chupitos!  Even Edgar got involved and then stopped by the police for looking too dodgy!  After a condom and an orgasm or two we walked a little less steadily up the hill to Costa Breve.  Again Bar Paris afterwards, bo!    So me and Steffen arent so lonely any more, starting all over agin is real difficult, me and Edgar just talking this minute about how it aint the same without the chance to pop down to Scobie's and know your gonna see tim or ulli with their faces glued to the screen!    Ulli, if you dont wanna send an email then I dont mind doin it, would be cool to get a weekly update from everybody all across Europe.  As for me, thats my update done, so kids be good, enjoy your Sunday evenings wherever you are and maybe I will put some fotos up on Walker's website if he lets me and you can see what the class of 2004 looks like!  Ciao for now,  A

      Apperantly the longest word in the world is Icelandic its vaðlaheiðarvegavinnuverkfærageymsluskúraútidyralyklakippuhringur it means Vaðlaheiði (its a place) roadworking shafts keychane ring. Another long word is Donaudampfschifffahrtgesellschaftskapitänswitwenrente which means 'sailors widow pension at the Donar (a river) shipping company'. I cant say for the German word but the Icelandic one isnt in our regular vocabulary.  Anyway if you have something better to write about... please do  Úlli

      Tim and Kat and Seema,  Are you all in the biggest party schools of USA. I juct checked out the pop-up that comes up when you sign in on MSN and it said that University of Illinois was 4. in the best party school in Hammerica. Utexas on the other hand in sixth place and descriped Austin as an interesting city that is perfect for students.  So do you really party more there than in Catalunya?  Hey just saw The Passion of Christ, really good movie, just to ruin the plot for you then he dies in the end... but not.  Later, Úlli

      Well, it's 2:30 in the afternoon on St. Paddy's and I'm still sober, so something ain't right. Got a review session tonight, then out to rectify the situation. Got some friends who were in Ireland with me coming down to visit. The one kid, his dad owns WGN, which for those of you who don't know is a television network here in the US. Big sports market...this kid is loaded. Had to learn how to drive when he went to Uni 'cause his limo driver wasn't coming with him. Adam, was it an interview with UBS? For internship or full-time? My interview with PwC was actually in the UBS building in Chicago, oddly enough. All 60 stories of it, or so. Anyone have any big plans for Paddy's Day?  I suppose not everyone does it all bang up like we do. Should be an extended drunk fest right through the weekend...we're on spring break next week. Adam, I'll be thinking of you on Friday. Wish I was there to spend it with you. Well, off to get my siesta in to prepare for tonight. Pics on Walkie's site to follow.  Cheers, Tim

      errrrr, this title means nothing apart from me practising my rhyming skills!  At the mo I am sitting in an internet cafe in the heart of London having just had an assessment centre with UBS (if you dont know who that is then look it up!),  and am now as sweaty as a paedophile in a nursery, pleasant thought I know!  Apart from that my life has generally been really hectic, went to Paris last week for a 3 day Warwick Uni seminar which was a bit of a joke, got to go on all the rides plus got smashed two nights at the one and only Hurricanes club, lots of young girls ;op  I then went on to stay at a friend of mine's in Paris for a further three nights of merriment and generally did bugger all sightseeing, dont think I would cut the grade as your common all garden Hamerican tourist!  I flew back to Barca on Sunday only to fly back to England on Monday and then my Ma and brother have flown out to Barca today so I have to fly back to meet them, and then my Dad comes tomorrow for........  MY BIRTHDAY on Friday, wooooooooooooooooooooo  I will be joining Tim on the big 2-1, who would have thought that somebody as immature as me could be so darn old?!?  Seriously should be good, very fancy restaurant lined up.  Anywayz, my time is running out and I dont wanna lose this so will add to it another time,  Be good boys and girls,  A xxxxxx

      Ok first of all congratulation with your 21st birthday hope you got really drunk (looks like it). I really liked the photos there are some pretty hot girlfriends you have over there. The thing why I writing this to you is that I saw one picture ( urlLink this one ). This guy looks seriously too much like one of our Italian foreign exchange students ( urlLink here ). I have to say even though I got a second opinion I have been known to see people who are completely different as "lookalikes". The guy on his right would be called tjokkó (choko). This is one of Icelands best known  urlLink chokko´s   Well later, Úlli

      Well, we've got more snow coming down here today. I thought we were done with that now that we're halfway through March, but apparently not. Everyone's gearing up for spring break around here, but I'll be working down here at Uni, so I'm really not that pumped. Ulli, I know what you mean about missing that something. I think what we all need is a little reunion. My vote for destination is Chicago! Just kidding...you're all welcome any time, but the only place less likely for a reunion would be New Zealand. Speaking of which, anyone heard from Caroline in a while? It seems that most people have dropped off the face of the earth. Adam will have to be dragged out of Mas i Mas if we want him to contribute to this blog. Or perhaps he's karaokeing (is that a word??) at Selmo, singing Queen at the top of his lungs with his new pals who inevitably can't sing as well as us. We did have Vegard, after all. Simon is currently searching China for Vegard, his next big prospect. Last weekend in Chicago was awesome. It's impossible to describe how cool it is to see 80 story buildings rising straight up along the river banks. Sears Tower's still there...still tall, too. I was gonna take some pics for everyone, but I figured that might make me look a bit touristy with my interviewers. Anyway, gotta run to Business Law now...should be fun. Studied "stee-moo-lee" today in marketing. Adam and Svana will remember how our Cons. Behaviour professor butchered stimuli every time and I nearly died with laughter. Well, my professor today pronounced it correctly, so it wasn't nearly as much fun. But I'm off. Ciao ciao for now, brown cow.

      Its 3:40 (am), Im really on the fence about weather to start doing homework due tomorrow or just watch some downloaded movie I took from my schools intranet an hour ago. This day feels like dejavu, not like a crazy one just sitting in the middle of the night writing blog coz I dont want to do what Im suppose to. Its been over a month like that, at least in last month I got lucky every Friday, but things are getting better, we actually had good weather yesterday.  Since my interest in downloaded movies I watched all 24, all Friends, all American Idol and a bunch of movies.  I hope I get an interesting summer job so I come refreshed from "vacation" and school will be more fun.    Ok I have to be more upbeat, just for the record Im not depressed or anything like that Im just missing something, hope I find it soon.   I just watched American Idol the wildcard show and there is this one guy Matt Metzelder or something he reminds me of Vegard they arent look alikes but Its funny just something that reminds me of that.  From that thought I started thinking about Love actually, just jokeing Tim, my last night in Barcelona when we went to the Kareaoki bar, we all sang "We Are the Champions" or something and they had to turn of the 'mikes'.  The thing that did remind me of this night though was Vegards performance of "Eye of the Tiger" which was just classic. I hoped that Walker was on MSN so he could send it to me but he wasnt, so much for that.  I got "of my tits"in this party last Friday (if you dont believe me (which you will) she can easily confirm). I got so drunk I came home in wrong shoes, and had to go back there the day after, embarrasing.  The only good thing is that I was meaning to hit on one of the prettiest girls in the school but happily something distracted me and I didnt.  Well thats it for now, its been along time since anyone other than me and Tim have bloged so thats by I called my post ghost town. Hopefully Adam will start posting, I think that is a critical success factor here.  Well later, Úlli

      Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA) is fighting for an independent Basque state in northern Spain and southwestern France.  The group has killed nearly 850 people since 1968, typically using car bombs or shootings. The number of ETA killings had been falling, from 23 in 2000 to three in 2003.  Spain, the United States and the European Union have listed ETA as a terrorist organization. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who survived an ETA attack while he was opposition leader in 1995, made eliminating the group a top priority.  In 2002 the Spanish government banned the Basque political party Batasuna, which it described as ETA’s political wing. The party denied the charge. Batasuna won 10 percent of the vote in Basque parliamentary elections in May 2001.  ETA has been under pressure in recent years with 179 suspected members detained during 2003 and a total of 650 suspects arrested since 2000, mostly in Spain and France.

      Sorry to cut that last one off so abruptly, but my girlfriend got back in the room and she was already pissed off, so I didn't want her to see me typing about Keira Knightley on her computer. Long story, but Keira has caused me problems before.  So, I was watching the news the other night, and they had an interesting occurrence at Wal-Mart. I'm sure most of you know what Wal-Mart is and that they sell products for cheap, but I'm not sure if you truly understand the clientele that visit a Wal-Mart store. These are your run-o-the-mill white trash, broke ass, got-nothing-better-to-do Americans (whether legal or illegal). By the way, I was just at Super Wal-Mart last night at midnight, but that's beside the point. So a lady goes into Wal-Mart and tries to pay with a 1 million dollar bill. Apparently the cashiers aren't as dumb as they look 'cause they caught on, and the lady was found to have 3 more in her purse. As if this lady with a NASCAR t-shirt and hair straight out the 80s would have 3 million dollars in her purse. Do we even make a 1 million dollar bill? I couldn't imagine a use for it, or why we would make it other than for Montgomery Burns to steal. Or for people to use at Wal-Mart. Hell, I had to wait 15 minutes last night 'cause I wanted 60 bucks cash back and they had to go to the vault to get it. How did THIS lady think she was going to get change from her million dollar bill??? Wal-Mart...finishing the job for George W.

      I get to go to Chicago for the weekend, and I'm pretty stoked about it. I leave school behind for the weekend and head up to Chi-town. I've got an interview with PwC downtown, and they're putting me up in a sweet hotel, taking me out to dinner in Little Italy tomorrow night, then grilling me mercilessly at the office on Friday morning. But it'll be good to get out of Central Illinois.  Glad to see that Ulli is STILL talking about Love Actually. I mean, it's a good movie, but move on Ulli. Keira Knightley is wicked hot, though. Rare for a Brit ;)  Bought my girlfriend the soundtrack and she listens to it 24-7 now. Got an insanely long e-mail from Wieteke the other day, so apparently Holland is still afloat. No word from SARS-chaser, Vegard.

      Uhhh I started liking this girl alot without knowing her to much, a week after I met her I started... well not disliking her but now she´s kind of nutral to me. But the strange thing is that I still have this feeling in my stomach that isnt very comfortable. So I remember this one conversation from the movie Love Actually which I hope most of you have seen and Im not in love like the kid in the movie but I know where he is coming from.  Daniel: Liam Neeson as the dad who thinks his son has some really big problem coz he´s acting weird Sam: The son whos acting strange  Daniel: So what's the problem, Sammy-o? Maybe... school - are you being bullied? or is it, I don't know - something worse? Can you give me any clues at all?  Sam: You really want to know?  Daniel: I really want to know.  Sam: Even though you won't be able to do anything to help?  Daniel: Even if that's the case.  Sam: OK. The truth is... I'm in love.  Daniel: Sorry?  Sam: The truth is I'm in love and there's nothing I can do about it, and it just keeps getting worse.  Daniel: Aren't you a bit young to be in love?  Sam: No.  Daniel: Oh, OK, right. Well, I can't deny it. I'm a little relieved.  Sam: Why?  Daniel: Well, you know - I thought it might be something worse. Sam  [incredulous]  Sam: Worse then the total agony of being in love?  Daniel: Oh. Yeah, you're right. Total agony.   Úlli

      Ulli,  As a linguistic buff, I can tell you that the English are not to blame for the word "defenestrate."  The word stems from the Old French "fennestre," or window (in Modern French the "s" is replaced with an accent circonflex, but I can't type that on my computer).  The prefix "de-" stems from Latin. So, we are wholly free from blame on this one, buddy. Take your qualms elsewhere for we are unequivocally innocent.

      Tim,  There is nothing in this world that can defend what Im about to say. As you know I have often said that your native language is Bullshit. And here is my proof:  Defenstrate: To throw something or somebody through a window in selfdefence  How did this word come alive. Did somebody do this and the police came and he said "but I only dentrated" i really dont understand.   Úlli

      Vegard, great pics. I'm sure I'll enjoy the captions more once my Norwegian dictionary arrives. What the hell does "paa" mean? I think if I learn that one I'll understand Norwegian. Does "og" mean "and?" The Chinese cities truly are impressive though, aren't they? Skyscrapers like none other, and I live in the birthplace of the skyscraper. Do people take you for an American often? Have you found yourself a nice Chinese girl to settle down with and have card-carrying, chopstick-toting babies? I, too, was pleased to see Barca's success. Saw a kid in a Barca jersey the other day, and I started humming the song of the Gent del Barca. And you'll have to ask Ulli about the Owen-Kluivert deal. I'm sure he's found a website that tracks the daily activities and phone conversations of all of Chelsea's foes, Premiership or otherwise. Glad to have your input to the blog, Vegard. This blog gets to seem like a bit of a threesome at times, and when I think threesome I don't think Adam and Ulli.   Cheers, Tim

      Hi again, First of all, congratulations Tim with your big decision. And so they lived happily ever after...  I guess you are scratching your heads why I'm suddenly able to blog now. It's not because the chinese decided to loosen up the censorship policy, or some hacker friend of mine managed to trick the system, but because I was forced to leave the country. After teaching 3 months on a tourism visa (my employer prefered to have it that way..), China no longer wanted to have me as a "tourist", so I was asked to leave China within 48 hours. So I did. After a big fight with the university whose fault this really was (obviously theirs), they agreed to cover all my expenses to go to Hong Kong.  So now I'm in Hong Kong trying to get the work permittance I should have gotten in the first place. But no reason not to combine business and pleasure, so I'll stay here a couple of days more. I'm heading back to China for the 1.May celebrations, which obviously is a big thing in communist China.  I put together a travel diary on the net where you can see some photos of my China life. There are also some stories in the diary there, but I'll guess you guys need to brush up your norwegian to be able to understand. Ulli and Svana might be able, though. We did share a common language some thousand years ago before we sent all our countries lunatics to the island in the west=) Anyway, the adress is:   http://www.resdagboken.se/travel.asp?id=9474&lang=eng  Cheers guys. To Adam and the rest in back in Barcelona. FC Barca's success has not passed unseen in China. Cheer on our lads so they reach next seasons Champions League. A norwegian newspaper delivered a story about a possible deal Owen-Kluivert. Any truth in it?   Veg

I have been crying in a corner ever since reading that Tim ;o( (that is a tear not a wink!)  Going to the gym with Edgar today, just had 4 hours of Spanish marketing arse class and stayed in and watched the footie last night, how could you not want to live your life vicariously through me, how much more exciting can you get?!?  I dare anyone to come up with a more thrilling day than that!  Toodle-pip,  A

      Well, it was my girlfriend's 21st today, so I figured what better birthday present than a lovely diamond ring and a marriage proposal. Went to a local park (no Parc Guell, but hey), got down on the ol' knee in a secluded part of the park and popped the question. She said yes (makes the story better, in my opinion, although a bit less interesting). So as y'all (haha) are not confused, my girlfriend will be referred to hereon out as "my fiancee." Nah, just kidding about all that, but it is kinda scary thinking of her as my fiancee. Scary in a good way, though. Like we're growing up. That's the scary part I guess...accelerating into the brick wall that is life after Uni. Wanted you guys to be among the first to know, though. Cava sent by express air post would not go unappreciated ;) But alas, time to hit the pit, as our brethren on the country/continent say.  Tim  PS-Enjoyed Vegard's post about the "yellow fellows." I've decided that from this day forth I will live vicariously through Vegard (sorry Adam, you were a close second).

      This post goes to y'all but specially Tim. Ok there is this guy whos been a hit here and came to throw a concert in downtown Reykjavík, I did miss it specially coz I didnt have a clue who he was but I heard great things about him and so I got myself his album. Ok his name is Damien Rice and he's kind of like David Gray but yet different, he has great lyrics and is often just his wonderful Irish (smile Tim) voice and a guitar. He also has this female singer with him and some songs are very much produced (not in a negative way). So y'all should get this album coz you'll love it (ok maybe not Constance but even Seema might:D). I have a feeling though that you've all heard of this fella and specially my beloved Tim.  Greetings from a studyroom, The Mofo

      Cheerio guys!  Compliments to you for managing to make your blogspot censored in China. I don't know whether it's Ulli's sleazy girl stories or your idiomatic discussions that caused it, but somehow the chinese ministers decided to cut off the entire chinese population from it. What a shame! Thanks Ulli for keeping me updated every now and then. All the free internet porn is available though...   Well, what to say? I'm bounded at a deserted village in the outskirts of a medium sized chinese city (4 mill.). Life is very relaxed. I'm teaching about 14 hours per week, and I just bought a bike that basically is my major joy right now. People are the most friendly I've ever met, and because I'm generally the only foreigner they have got to know as well they seem very excited to have this norwegian curiousity here. I arranged a football tournament last week. The response was overwhelming with more than 20 teams. More than 500 people came to watch the final. My norwegian football shirt was given away to the one voted "Most valuable player" of the tournament. I know it's a really american thing to do, but it was great fun...   To make this short I made a list with things I like and don't like about China:   Likes:  - Prices  - Pirate DVDs. After buying 4 seasons of the Sopranos and 3 seasons of the West Wing I've got home entertainment for the next month or so..  - Chinese, which must be the funniest language I've ever tried to learn.   Dislikes:  - "Guanxi", a chinese word you better learn if you're ever gonna get into business with the yellow fellows. Guanxi means "friends/connections" and is essencial for every thing you do. Hence, what you do is not as important as who you know. People here use to hang photos of their most important "Guanxi's" on the wall in their office so that everybody can see that if you mess with me, you are also messing with him.  - Red Tape and Bureaucracy. If there's something you want to change or do, wait for at least 10 peoples approval. Something that normally takes from 10-30 days. I've been here for almost three months, but the college still haven't managed to give me an employment contract.  - As the subject indicates, why the hell do they stick to the chopsticks after the discoveries of knife and fork. We're living in the 21st century for Christ sake,

      I know I have been AWOL for a while but my life has continued to be on the jet set side of things, followed up Madrid with a hectic week back home in the land of Eng and am now back in Barca!  Would be a lot better if it wasnt pissing down outside but it reminds me of home (aaaaaaahhhhh) so it aint all bad.  Madrid was ace, Steffen trying to pull most things Spanish that moved (jokes!) and only a few bombs went off in the vicinity so generally safe!  Did our fair share of sightseeing, got the Prado and Royal Palace and did the whole tourist thing with the audio guided tour, had to be done.  Sat on top of the tourist bus (the one you used to point at in Barca and say "what a bunch of coños") with headphones on and map out, the pictures, when they get put up, will be great!  Eventually got to the Bernabéu on the other side of town which was damn impressive and certainly gives the Nou Camp a run for its money (by the way has anyone seen the new Nike advert with Brazil vs Portugal, really cool and filmed in the Nou Camp!).  Being back home was nice but a real whirlwind trip, being back for 6 days is never enough time to see everyone and do everything but it all kinda got fitted in somehow, even managed to work a day back at the old Phone House, my last day was far more boring than it was emotional!  Had a couple of big nights out, you guys have not had a large one unless you have been to Oceana in Kingston, as Constance would say, y'all gotta come and visit!  Went down to a friend's boat on the Friday and got smashed off our faces which involved stealing things from the local pub and trying not to fall off the boat!  Managed to survive however and had a nice family din dins on the last night to celebrate various bdays (Ma and Pa have theirs on the same day which makes for an expensive time of things, just found out I have an exam on the very day :o( )  I did manage to get a new charger for my camera which was what was wrong, I think Edgar tried to eat my old one so it is now back in action.  Again, time on this damned infernal blasted money grabbing extortionate piece of shite internet cafe computer is gonna run out so,  be good boys and girls, one love,  A

      Im at school now and trying to study for Finance II the most boring course Ive ever taken. Anyway Ive been listening to some CD that are on the school network and I just finished listening to the William Hong CD. Ok I think the guy is great but give me a brake. This is fun for the first 2 or 3 songs but then you just get a headache, he really cant finish off more than 1/2 a song so the first part of his songs are always so much better than the second.  Anyway here in Iceland we've got  urlLink Leoncie !!! Shes this Indian who believes shes the best thing since well... EVER. Shes always in some fight with somebody around here calling them racist and something like that.  Now shes leaving the country for a huge record deal (Yeah right).  Back to finance.

      Yesterday I went drinking downtown and actually it was a blast. The bars and clubs opened at midnight so we started at my friends house and then went to the bars which are like 10 minutes from his house.  I met alot of people and one girl asked for my phone number.  The strangest thing happened when I was on my way home I saw this girl waiting for a taxi and we started talking and decided to take the cab together because then we can save the start fee. Ok so when we come to my house and I give the driver my card, but its denied so he tries again and in the meanwhile I get the girls phone number coz she had offered to pay it if it wouldn't come through... Finally it did and I went in. Ok so I decided to send her a text message and tell her that if she was paying more than usual and the start fee didn't pay off I´d pay her back.    Well she called me and we talked for a while and she told me that after I left the cab the driver had said to her that I was definitely popping E.  Im not gonna lie about that Im not the healthiest of 'em all but I dont take (illegal) drugs.  We then decided that I'd come over and we just talked alot and I'm meeting her later tonight. And to clarify things I didn't have sex with her... yet.  And for Tim ... she has no kids at all:)  Úlli

      I was listening to some David Gray tonight and he got me thinking of how much I miss the places I lived in Europe. I listened to David for an entire bus trip from Dingle to Galway, which is lengthy. Gotta love the repeat function. And Ulli and I would occasionally listen to David on the ghetto setup that Ulli had going on in his flat (Discman, crazy cords, need I say more?). My girlfriend insists on you guys being at the wedding. Only problem is if Ulli's coming, I'll have to tell my mom she can't go. Had a rough week at school here, too, and it's going to be rough for the rest of the term. I've got a Field Research Project to complete on a company's inventory control systems, and we haven't even selected a company yet. Due at the end of the month. I envy Adam and his ESADE courses right now.  To clear up Ulli's confusion..."lil' hunk o' tin" simply means little piece of metal, referring to Conor's camera. "Bumping and grinding" is just what we call dancing all up on girls, and "camera-thumping toughs" just means tough guys who feel the need to beat up on innocent cameras.  The whole bit about Prince of Tides and discuss is taken from a Saturday Night Live skit from a long time ago. If you search for Prince of Tides and SNL on Kazaa, something might turn up. And by Bob, I was referring to Bob Ross, who has this 1/2 hour programme on television where he teaches people how to paint. He's always talking about "happy little trees" and "happy little clouds." I was reading in the Wall Street Journal that his show is broadcast in 20 countries, and Iceland is one of them. He's soon to expand into Russia and Africa. Weird part is, he's been dead for 9 years. Ulli, let me know if that clears everything up (I would offer to clear it up for anyone else, but no one else even reads this blog). Bed calls.  T

      No, just kidding,  Ok what's up in Reykjavík..Well not much I'm still looking for a job and now I have to start pulling strings which I really don't like. I haven't yet heard about the guide job but I'm still as pessimistic as before about that.  I might get a job at the countries biggest insurance company or Iceland's BBC but that's not really interesting except for the fact that I'm really nervous.  Last Monday we had first (of two exams) and the next one is on the 20th of this month so we rented a house in the country and got wasted for two days. It was fairly interesting though I did behave unlike last year when I made a big scandal (not to be published anywhere).  The second day I was more drunk but still didn't do anything terrible.  My friend was another one of those houses like an hour away probable more drunk than I was (it's possible) and decided he wanted to pay me a visit, we'll something like 15-20 people came out and stopped him.  Thank god!!!!  Ok I have to ask about few things here since English isn't my first language and there are just quite a few things in Tims post that aren't adding up in my book.  What does "lil' hunk o' tin" mean (and pretty much all the sentence before that one too).... Second Bob who?... Prince of Tides ... Yes Barbara Str&%$# is my all time favoractressrice so I wouldn't stop talking about her so I won't begin. ..  I would like to tell you about the pretty much only thing that happens in this city but Svana says that I'm sad if I do so.  Well I can't think of anything useless to say so I guess I have to go back to study for my Finance II exam.  Later, Úlli

      Well, I'm glad we've heard from Adam. After that last blog from Ulli concerning Icelandic vocabulary I thought we'd begun the inevitable downhill slide toward the end of our blog. Ulli, I know more interesting stuff than that happens in Reykjavik. I hear they even broadcast Bob Ross' painting show in Iceland (as well as the UK). He's an icon over here....discuss. Prince of Tides is about neither princes nor tides...discuss.   A, what's happened to the camera? Have a spill while bumping and grinding? Run into some camera-thumping toughs prowling the Raval? Conor's got himself a new camera...the Pentax one that fits in an Altoids tin. Pretty sweet lil' hunk o' tin. Currently I'm enjoying the lingering sunshine due to daylight savings time (just happened this Sat...I believe we're behind you Europeans). The baseball season kicked off today...Vice President Cheney threw out the first pitch for my Cubbies, but we managed to win despite the fact.   Gotta get some grub now...I'll throw more at ya later.  T-dog

      I write this, sitting next to Steffen in an internet cafe in Madrid, has been a bit of a surreal week as we have had the pleasure of Bea coming back to Barca for one night and one night only and then last night we went out on the piss with Constance in Madrid, super duper I must say.  We checked out a fairly big club called Joy, with an amazing dancer on stage, we dribbled all night long, pretty pricy gawping session though as drinkies came in at over €10, :o(  From Madrid I am goin back to London for Semana Santa and then back to Barca for Steffen's last week, gonna be emotional, I will be the last one left standing!  Trying to work out which sights and sounds to experience in the last 5 days so should be pretty hardcore.  Apart from that I have managed to secure me a job at UBS for the summer which is ace, it looks like Constance has got a job lined up with Merrill Lynch, Bee Bee is working at an Italian bank and Steffen has an interview with JP Morgan, if Tim joins the team (and working as a cashier does not count Tim & Ulli) then I think we will be a fully fledged bunch of capitalist bastards.  All about the money really!  Hopefully when my camera gets fixed and Steffen's Konami digital camera prints a few photos out then we will put some evidence of our travails on Walky's website.  As a note it appears that most people have been sent instructions as how to blog but either cant be bloggered (you know you love it!) or just cant comprehend how, I tink da process needs to be simplified!  Hasta entonces tios y tias, I also had a really cool birthday, massive party etc...... but am running out of time on this machine so you will have to stay on the edge of your seats and wait for me to tell you about it another time!  Hasta la pasta,  Adam (& Steffen)

      So, I'm at the uni health center to pick up my meds for my Peru/Bolivia trip in August. No, Adam, I'm not going permanently. My uncle had a 2 week trip planned with some Bolivians he does research with, and he invited me along. It was an offer I couldn't resist. I haven't seen Sudamerica yet. So I'll be Titicaca-ing it this August. Should be a nice break before coming back for my last semester at uni in the fall. Well, at least until grad school. Gotta go get my meds now...wouldn't want malaria or typhoid. Write more later.  Tim

      So, guess who was in town last night?????????  Brazil!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No, not the whole country, don't be silly!  The national football team I mean, and guess who went to see them play Catalunya????????  Me!!!!!!! And it was wicked, 5-2 to Brazil, the atmosphere was crazy, brazilians playing drums, the fans actually making some noise!  I swear that there was more chanting etc... at this one game than in all the others I have been to see put together!  Mexican waves, you name it we had it!  Ronaldo scored two cracking goals before going off at half time and we even had an overhead kick to top it all off, special!  Went to the Catwalk on Saturday night and got smacked off my face.......again!  Ended up in passeig de gracia metro, walking between the yellow and green lines (that long, interminable walk!) pretending to be in the matrix, sound effects and everything!  Must have been quite amusing!  Last night was time to say goodbye to one of the girls who came in January, sayin goodbye to people for the third time in a year became a surreal experience, doesnt get any easier!  Edgar has gone on holiday and left me all alone for a week, all about having a pre-party really!  Forsnizzel ;op  Anywho, must go and find something to do, so peace out, one love,  A

      I am very honored that you remembered that line Tim! Why are you going to Bolivia though?  I met this girl from Bolivia in my uni the other day.  She is married to an Icelander and so is her aunt (i.e. a different icelander :) ).  She told me that in her city (can't remember the name of it) her aunt's husband runs a fast food restaurant called something like "sagas-fast-food" (as in the "icelandic sagas") which is in that city as known and "important" as Subway!  .... I'm telling you Icelanders are slowly but surely conquering the world! :)  So, my thesis is due in 14 hours. It is 3 a.m. right now and I am pretty sure I will be working on it for the next 14 hours straight!  Except for this one hour between 10-11a.m. Then, without hardly any sleep for the last week and no sleep for tonight I have to attend my second interview for a internship for the ministry of foreign affairs (or at least that is what I think that they call that ministry in english).  88 people applied, they interviewed 80 and now the group has shrunken down to the beautiful number of 15. Eight possisions are avaliable so my chances are pretty high... and the greatest thing of all is that there is this guy that applied from my school who I thought was the most eligible for the job BUT he is not in the group hahahahaha .... I am sooo mean :)  Well, if anyone thinks that this post is somehow wierd, nasty or badly spelled, I blame too much coffee, no sleep and my damm university for making us write a thesis - none of you have to write one - right?  anyway, take care, Svana

      Ulli,  Kevin and I got a good laugh reading about your tumble. I had some run-ins with spiked fences in Ireland, so I know your pain. As for the whale hunting, I am not so knowledgeable on the subject. I live far from the ocean and any whales, and far from any fishing towns. People here don't exactly protest the killing of corn or soybeans. I suspect your problems all stem from that damn movie, Free Willy. Everybody wants to save the damn whales now, and they think the best way to save them is to not kill ANY of them. Not always the solution. It's a good thing Runa, Lars, and Vegard killed Keiko. And who said Icelanders and Norwegians don't agree? I should be reading all about auditing and the US tax system right now, but I find Ulli's recollections of his drunken gallivantings much more interesting (better look up "gallivant," Ulli). Got a mean craving for bravas right now, but none to be had here. Heading home this weekend, so there should be some good Polish food awaiting me at my girlfriend's. Watching this funny European finance masters student across from me right now, and he looks thoroughly confused by his computer. Perhaps he has the same problems you had, Ulli. Well, time to go before he decides that maybe I can help him.  Toodle pip (as Adam has been known to remark), Tim

      The other day all most every Icelander did get this letter from Greenpeace members asking Icelanders to unite not to shoot whales (not with a Capital W Adam).  For last 15 years Icelanders haven't "fished" whales for a profession but just before me and Svana went to BCN they started again with shooting 45 whales over a three year period.  It was in some countries outshouted that it was a scandalous that people shouldn't go to Iceland for that reason. Well Greenpeace did go a more civilized way of protesting now than 15 years ago, when they sunk 3 whale fishing boats, and did do Icelanders an offer that would be beneficial to the country. Well we didn't listen!!!  So German Greenpeace members did unite that every member would send a few letters each to every Icelander listed. And I got one. To start with the letter is in icelandic and says that the one who signs it did get a German version of it and does understand and agree with it. The biggest thing in this letter is that there are so many wrong things in it also it doesn't have all the facts like that we are fishing 45 whales out of (if I remember correctly) 6.000 and that they do eat a lot of fish away from us.  The best wrong fact is that the letter states that over the last 15 years popularity of whale meat has reduced substantially due to among others chemicals in the meat. Ok I can only talk for myself but the main reason in my believe is that it hasn't been AVAILABLE.   So now I'm writing this German Salim (good name for a German)to his email address he was kind enough to leave and putting him straight.  If somebody else wants to do the same is email address is s.hassan@gmx.de  About my injury I wrote about in last post the visual effects have reduced from the nose and chin and all I've got is this small Hitler like mustache.

      Yes, yes y'all!  Hows it all hangin, I want a comment from everyone telling me how they are, what they did today and what the weather is like!  Vale?!?  Over here, it is scorching, there is no reason that I should be in the CPD typing away but I thought I would let you know how nice it was and how much fun it would be if you were all here!!!!!!!  Take Sunday for example, started of with an enforced lie in after getting smashed off my face on Saturday at a house party.  Was followed by a leisurely taxi to the beach with some CEMS and was subsequently treated to 4 hours of sun loving checking out all the talent that seemed to creep out when the sun shines, an unbelievable selection!  Ulli you would have loved it!  So after this relaxation I get a call offering me free tickets to Barça's last home match of the season, a couple of socis gave us their cards and we had prime position on the half way line in the second tier to see Luis Enrique play his last match.  The sun was on us until well into the second half and a couple of spliffs made it an entirely enjoyable experience.  A little local tapas bar welcomed us afterwards and after a few jarras I was ready for bed!  I can only imagine how crazy it would be if everyone who had studied here this year was still here now!  I spent the whole of last week in Paris enjoying the sun as Barca got the last of the rain out of its system.  Spent two luxury days with the fam celebrating my ma and pa's bdays (same day, bit funky huh?!?) and then stayed with my best friend from uni who has an apartment 5 minutes away from the Arc de Triomphe.  Even had the chance to have a few cervecitas with Steffen who was passing by to see some friends.  In fact Steffen and Valerie are both coming back to visit in a couple of weeks.  That means I am gonna TRY to get all my work done before that and then the real party will begin!  Anybody else fancy it¿?!?  Hope everything cool with the gang, comments galore remember.  The blog is not dead, long live the blog!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Peace out, one love, respect,  A

      There hasn't been much going on this website for the last few weeks so I guess it my responsibility to tell yall about my life in the moment.  I started working at the bank on Wednesday, the day after we gave a presentation about our report in this course called strategy... I think I've told every one that I we had this golf club and were trying to improve the service.  The job is ok Im one of two guys in 17 people department which is ok. It will get rather boring coz I just putting numbers on a computer but hopefully I can get something better next summer.  Funny thing the school had like a final party and we drove a little bit out of the city and to this, Id call community centre after a few beers I thought it would be a good idea to check out the pool but had to climb over this fence which was in the way. Long story short I look like Rudolf the rednose... My nose is red, my upper lip, chin on two places (how I did hurt both (under) chin and the nose at the same time is beyond me) and finally both my hands. It´ll be rather embarrassing to go to work on tomorrow looking like I was in the fight of my life.... You should have seen the other guy ;)  Today and yesterday I've been watching The Office and its just so funny. Sometimes its so embarrassing I just cant look. Think the American version will be a flop though.  Later, Úlli

      Ive been thinking.....  First I did make a mirror site of this on in case it could of any use to Vegard. The name url is  urlLink www.bartomas.tk .  The other thing is that Ive been thinking about changing hosts all togather and go to central.is this has everything in a very user friendly manner. We can vote, comment, put links and have a guestbook and everything else here is a  urlLink link . We can change the colors but the other stuff no.  I think ill put a survey on this site to check but its rather much mess to do it.  Úlli

When Im in the computer lab and I start laughing out loud I get the strangest looks. Oh well though, like I care! Anyway, Timmy, Im so glad about the engagement! Tell the fiancé that I said congrats and instead of sending yall the Cava I´ll just go ahead and drink the entire bottle and think of yall.  So, I have a crush on this French guy that is at the same uni (I cant believe Ive started saying that) as I am. He plays on the rugby team. He had a party at his house and we ended up kissing and now there are pictures of it all over this website (kinda like the fotki one we use).  So this thing is being ghetto and i have to keep writing stuff over and over again sorry if its annoying to read. because im not an UPGRADED MEMBER i can only send comments   Im going to New York City this Friday for my sisters graduation. Itll be good to be in the city for a hot second and then takin it back to Madrid. Instead of going club hopping Ill be going concrete jungle hopping  OK, this is a long comment. Will someone please send me a FUNCTIOAL link so that I can actually post on here instead of writing dreadfully long comments.  Oh yea, Vegard, what is your email address?  if you wanna get a CD get Kayne West... its hot  Ugh, the weather sucks and i dont wanna have to go outside to walk to the metro. blah blah no sun this hell should be freezing over any day now.  Beso, Constance

      Hey hey,  Jeg skal til arbejden på Landsbankinn... or what ever  Ok Ive finally got a job and guess what its at a bank. Its actually the bank whitch is in the same house as the one I used to work.  Im not really sure what Im suppose to do but its propably interesting and I think Im going to manage a portfolio for a retirement fund... not sure though. So I guess all of us are going to work in a bank next summer. The name od this post is mostlikly my new email which I dont like exept for the ending:D The owner of the bank is a big football fan and we support the same team in Iceland (remember the black and white stripe shirt... that one) so if Im having problems I just go and chat with him about the starting line up.  There isnt really muc going on I finished my tests the 20th and started working on this project in the following. We are making strategy for Icelands biggest golf club (and Europes 5th biggest) and its been realy fun. Its an actual consulting work so I we arent just doing this for the teacher, this will be used. There are bigger companies around (which other groups have) but we are making a strategy for the whole club, some groups only have one department or something like that.    Well thats it for know, Úlli

      Hey,  The other day I wrote to Seema and Kat and got replies today so Im going to post some of their letters here first Seems:  I graduated from UT at the end of May.  Graduation weekend was wonderful- I had family come in from all over.  It was really sad to say goodbye to my best pals, but I guess that's life.  I have now moved from Austin back to Dallas where I'll attend medical school.  I got into my top choice school here in Dallas, so I'm pretty happy about that.  It's a four year program, and in my fourth year I'll apply for residency (specialization) programs.  I'll probably try to leave Texas for that, just to have a new experience.      I just got back from Las Vegas last night.  I went to Las Vegas to meet up with old friends and my family that lives there (I used to live in Vegas), and then we all drove to Phoenix, Arizona for our cousin's wedding anniversary party.  That part of the country is beautiful.  I had fun playing with all my baby cousins :)  Next week, I'm leaving to go to South America for a post graduation backpacking trip with three of my friends from college.  We're going to spend a month there, and travel to Brazil, Peru, and Argentina.  I'm very excited about the whole thing - it should be an adventure!   Besos,      Seema  And then Kat:  ....I haven't read the Bar Tomas blog in a long time too.  I hope you and the rest of the barcelona crew are doing well.  Well, what's going on with me...  This summer I've been interning at the state capitol with a representative.  She's the chair of the Border and International Affairs committee, and I've been doing research on Texas/Mexico border issues for the next legislative session.  It's pretty interesting, and I'm definitely learning a lot.  I don't know about a career in politics or anything, but it's nice to know that we could pass legislation that would address some of the problems there.  I'm also taking a couple summer classes, and taking it pretty easy-- hanging out with friends and my family.  My sister just graduated, one of my cousins got married, and another cousin graduated-- so lots of family stuff.    Regular classes will start back up again in August and then it will be full speed ahead until graduation (I forgot how busy things are here compared to Barcelona).  I can't believe it's my last year.  I'll be graduating in May.  After that I'm not sure what my next step is going to be.  Hopefully I'll get some job offers maybe grad school... who knows :)  I have a lot of mixed feelings I guess.  It's scary and exciting, but I'm ready for a change.    (then she replies to something I wrote)  No, I haven't been watching handball, but since you're such a sports fan, you should know that the Longhorns (My university's baseball team) are in the finals of the college world series!  It's pretty exciting!!!  So the "world series" is a bit of a misnomer... since its basically colleges in the US.  Nevertheless, it's BIG TIME!  Well, that's all I have for now.  I hope to hear from you soon :)  Katherine

      A,  Despite your love of Rooonaldo, I think ol' Sven might've gotten carried away. Scolari summed it up best, "One is white, the other is black. Rooney is an excellent player but Pele is unique.  "There will never be another Pele, not in 1,000 years, even in a computer game."  I love the part about not even in a computer game. Apparently that was a necessary addition, because I was definitely thinking to myself "Well, what about in a computer game?"   A, hope you enjoy the last few nights in Barcelona. Say hello to all the old haunts. Don't forget to enjoy every sight and sound...the horns honking constantly, the motos whining uphill, the announcements on the Metro. Give em your best "Adeu." Hope you've got something to cheer about tomorrow night. Those Iberians all need a dose of reality.  Cheers, Tim

      This could well be my last blog from Barcelona guys so I want lots of attention, plenty of comments and hopefully a few nice goodbye (rather than good riddance) notes!  I went back to England last week for three days which was excellent, essentially I went back for a HUGE party called the 'Final Fling' which is for all the finalists this year which included most of my friends and all the randoms that I generally meet when I am out on the lash!  Tuesday night was the warm up, which meant one thing and one thing only..............SUGAR!  Yes, probably the worst night club in the West Midlands (respect) was hosting its very own VodBull night which consists of paying a pound and receiving in return a small plastic cup containing a shot of vodka and a dribble of red bull.  It basically turns into carnage and I was all over the place which did not help the preparations for the next day!  Welcome back to English timing anywayz, thats all I can say, we had to be at the party at 6 on the Wednesday to start eating which was ridiculous!  Anywho, the night went on until three in the morning, so the sheer length of the night meant that I got drunk on three separate occasions and then sobered up!  They held it in a country house in the massive gardens, there were two huge tents with all sorts of great acts!  Ash headlined and then there were the Scissor Sisters, Amy Winehouse and Spooks too (pretty sure that most of you will never have heard of any of them as most of my friends hadn't but you will just have to trust me that it is a phat line up!).  There was also a full blown fairground with dodgems and everything (great picture of me, soon to come on Walker's website!).  Well, the hangover lasted longer than the night I am pretty sure!  The next day was a bit of a washout apart from watching England labour to a 3-0 win over Switzerland which was neither pretty nor entertaining....  Luckily we spanked Croatia on Monday!!!!!!!!!!!!!Woooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! Quarter finals here we come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So on my final night in Barcelona, I think I could well be down Scobie's for some pre-game drinking and keep my fingers crossed that I don't leave completely depressed!  It is gonna be a very good game I think, keep your eyes peeled for the young man, I think his name is.....  ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONALDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Had my final exam this morning in Marketing Internacional and it was a typical ESADE joke, started half an hour late, only took 50 minutes of an hour and a half, piece of piss ;op  so I am as free as a bird (until Monday when I start work!) and may well go and burn some euros down Passeig de Gracia this avo...  Hope everyone is keeping well, I may be able to get Steffen blogging soon so that it won't be such a close knit club!  Funny story, saw good old Marta in the Sports Bar last night watching the Italy match, it is a small world I tell ya!  Ciao for now,  A

      Well, I suppose we have to beat England's former colonies before we can beat the big dogs themselves (though last I checked, US was ranked 9th, ahead of England and Italia). But the reason I mention this match is twofold. First, to warn Adam that we're coming for him, just like the Continental soldiers came for the redcoats. Second, one of the announcers yesterday made a terrible comment during the game. But a little background is necessary. Back in the 80s, the US invaded Grenada for some unknown reason (unknown to me, that is). The invasion was brief (Grenadiens number only 90,000) and I believe quite bloody. Probably an effort to put down some coup d'etat or other. But anyway, fast forward to 2004. The commentators during yesterday's match said "Grenada needs a 4-0 victory to win on aggregate, and they have about as much chance of that as they did in the invasion back in the 80s." I thought this was in poor taste, and I just wanted to comment on it. It reminded me of something George W. would say over coffee with his Yale mates. Kerry, 2004.  Tóg go bog é, Tadhg Ffrench (cupla focail gaeilge just to keep you guessing)

      Graduations, returns to England, so bittersweet it seems. For a while there I was beginning to think Adam might forever remain a fixture of Barcelona. I suppose he will in my mind, at least until I see him in his natural habitat. But for now, it is the kings of Barcelona that I will remember, the princes of Scobie's, the lords of Danzatoria. Svana, congrats on the graduation, even though I could not begin to pronounce nor comprehend your new title. I barely mastered "car" in Icelandic. And no worries about the length of the blog...since the response has been piss-poor, feel free to type all you want. That will give us sufficient browsing material for the weekly hiatus between blogs. What the hell is everyone else doing with their lives that they don't have time to blog? Vegard I can understand, but where's everyone else? Perhaps people need a reminder, Ulli. Caroline did say she was interested given proper coaxing (aka information concerning signing on). The others could even blog in Spanish or Italian if they want...I'm sure we could figure out some of it. Steffen and Valerie have no excuse with their English skills, nor does Magnus, who is at times more American than the Americans and more English than the English. Funny sidenote...I told Conor that Magnus was Swedish and he was like "What!!??" Conor thought the entire time that Magnus was American. Apparently he's got a good accent (or Conor's just deaf and unobservant--or observative, as Manolo would say, right A?). I'm in the process of paying a fine for a speeding ticket, as well as registering for the Drivers' Safety course that is required to keep the violation off my record. Gas prices have tamed down a bit, though I suppose I shouldn't complain considering the fact that we get nearly 4 liters for $1.80 and consider that high. I do think I'll buy one of Honda's new hybrids when I get around to buying a car. But for now my old one will have to do. I suppose I should study a bit now...I've got 2 exams on Thursday. Summer classes suck, I tell you. La culpa es mia for registering, I suppose. Anyway, stay Euro all.  Ciao, Tim

      Adam,  Lol... reminded me of a game at Camp Nou few years ago.  Liverpool took care of England:D  What England lacks is a good right back, any left winger at all and decent strikers, Owen is ok and though Rooney was great yesterday the rest is rather average. If Eiður were English he'd be in the starting line up every time.  At least better than my country that has something like 4 decent players.  Úlli

      Hey, how is everyone doing?  Last weekend must have been one of the best in my life!  I finally graduated from university and threw one of the best parties I have thrown so far! Now I have the respectful title "Svanlaug Jóhannsdóttir, Viðskiptafrædingur"  The day started at 9 a.m. at the hairdressers. There I spent an hour trying to get my "straighter-that-anything" hair to curl a little.  Then at 11 we met at school to take a photo of the whole graduation group. In the e-mail that the school sent us before it said that the photo was to be taken outside if the weather good but inside if the weather was bad. It was poring rain - but still they decided to take the photo outside and all the beautiful curls I had just spent and hour and 35 euros to make just straightened in a few minutes.....  The ceremony was dead boring.  It was held in the city theater and all the students sat on chairs on stage in front of the audience. Lucky me, in my short skirt, ended up on the front row and spent the next two hours trying to keep my legs together and not show the audience my underwear.  Being so short that I can usually not reach the floor when sitting on a chair this was a hard task and after the two hours ceremony my "keep-legs-together-muscles" were quite sore.   So when the whole thing was over I went home to meet the whole family over coffee and cakes.  My boyfriends family and grandma came as well and this was the first time that the two families and grandmas met.  It was very funny to introduce the two grandmas, I don´t think that I have actually introduced two old women before.   Around 8 p.m. my friends came over and we had a summerly barbecue despite the rain and wind - and as expressed earlier, the party was a blast.  We went down town where I hardly met any of my classmates - my guess is that they all drank to much and passed out way too early.  The whole thing ended at 7 in the morning when my friend spilled tomato-sauce of her fajitas over my white suit!  I started working again in the bank last week and I remind myself every day that I only have to work here for a couple of months. It is a nice bank and the people I work with are great, not to forget the great parties that the bank likes to throw but even though I am learning new things I just know that once I learn to do what I am suppoused to do work will get so routine-like and I will be bored to death!  I shouldn't complain though.  It is a better job than many have and my boss really likes me so I get away with doing almost everything that I want to...... like GOING TO NEW YORK after two weeks !!!!! : )  So if anybody is going to be in the neighborhood of NY from the 25th to the 30th of June, please let me know so that we can meet up.  From the 30th of June until to the 4th of July I will be in my friends wedding in Philadelphia.   So, now all I have to do is figure out how to afford this all.  After BCN, Croatia and NY I am going to be pretty broke and I have no idea how I am going to survive without any paycheck from september to january.  All extra jobs pay pretty low..... except for maybe prostitution!!! : ).... so if anyone likes small, soft and dark haired - let me know ;)   Take care,  Svanlaug Jóhannsdóttir, viðskiptafræðingur

      Ok, so maybe only 5 people read this damn thing but for their benefit I am gonna express just how much I am looking forward to what is gonna start in two hours time.  Once again my subject matter is football related but as I sit here in the newly opened Locutorio on Borrell in my England shirt the sense of anticipation continues to build.  England vs. France my friends will kick off very very soon and as soon as my time runs out on this machine I will most probably start on the pre-drinking, on my own if I have to!  Of course, I may well wake up hungover and devastated come tomorrow morning but whilst my optimism still exists I find it worthy of celebrating!  Three of my friends from back home have just left me following on the heels of Steffen and Vali, which capped off 8 days of hectic living in my apartment!  My body was racked for days with various ailments and I have only just started to shit solidly for the first time in a week (sorry, very crude I know!).  The flat is back ship shape and I started to pack up some of the crap that I have managed to accumulate over the last ten months, you would all be surprised by how much stuff is in my room and I may well be surprised by how much I might have to leave behind!  It is strange to think that my time here is coming to an end, it is strange even to think that I am still here considering that most of everyone else left over 6 months ago and I have said hello and goodbye to more faces than I can remember.  I am really looking forward to going home though, my time has come and I am really glad that I will be leaving on a high....  So off to the football I go, wish me luck won't you, we wouldnt want those frog bastards to win now would we ;op  Be good boys and girls,  A

      Ok,  Yes it did hurt!!! 6 fucking 1 and the thing was that England wasn't really that good we were just terrible. If England thinks that they have shown what is about to come they are wrong we just sucked 12-0 wouldn't had been unfair. 3 of the goals were deflections (gol de los churros) and unlucky really but England also had really good changes they blew and  scored one more goal that was ruled offside though it wasn't.  What went wrong then? Quite a few things as you can imagine but some more extreme than others.  We did in last year loose the leaders of team so we have got a quite silent defense which isn't good in team work these players are Guðni Bergson, Eyjólfur Sverrisson and Rúnar Kristinsson the last one is a midfielder but we are also lacking leaders there. Now the only leader we have is Eiður.  We didn't have enough midfielders since players playing in Norway weren't allowed to play and Brynjar did get a red card against Japan for a two footed tackle. For that reason Eiður was moved to the midfield where he doesn't work.  There are a lot of explanations but simply we played badly.  The bright points: Indriði (the left wing back) just salted Gary Neville. Eiður did get some things going but all and all sucked. Herman (the Herminator) sucked but every header against Campell he had in the game he one remember the goal A. Kristján (the first substitute) wasnt that great but just ate Joe Cole and he is the fastest MoFo around could probably out run Henry!!!  Will back to crying there will be sometime until we will do anything and we have to start looking for leaders. We had one generation with 5 but now no one.  Well I going downtown to hunt, later.

      I am gonna keep this short and sweet, I don't wanna rub too much salt into the wound ya see.  The thing is that there was a little football match today though I'm not sure if everyone knows about it so I shall clarify.  You remember the little cold island where Ulli and Svana live........yeah, Iceland, thats it!  Well they just happened to have the misfortune of playing the best country in the world today.  No not Brazil,  ENGERLAND, ENGERLAND, ENGERLAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would love to say that it was a case of David vs. Goliath and that the underdog came out on top but unfortunately it wasn't.  We crushed them, thrashed them, smashed them out of the park,                                 6 - 1  Thats right, some of us had to remember how to count up that far!  I for one did!  So ends the gloating, at least you scored a goal guys, well played!  I am sitting here with Steffen, Valerie just left today.  We have hit all the top nightspots though disappointingly Bar Paris has not received a visit!  We did it the only way possible and hit Dicotheque VIP last night which is always nice.  The night before saw us taking in Danzatoria Tibidabo and Club Sutton, all about the free entries really.  And finally, on the first night we all got fairly emborachado and ended up trying to dance to salsa............big mistake!  Steffen and Vali actually managed to pull it off, I on the other hand just preceeded to do a very bad impression involving a lot of twirling ;op  Was really nice, though very interesting at the same time to have the guys back, especially Vali as it had been such a long time....  I have my friends coming tomorrow so the carnage continues but in all honesty I am not sure if my body can take it, I already have the shits and the shakes and I am not sure how much more it can take!  Ulli, hope your not still crying...........  One love,  A

      Well, Adam, our school system really is not all that complex. Most students start off in kindergarten (some German word we stole...why, I don't know). Then you have 12 years of school before heading off to Uni (assuming you pass each grade in 1 year...some people need more than that--they ride the short bus to school). Grades K (kindergarten) through 5 are generally called primary, elementary, or grade school, depending on where you're at in the country. Then grades 6-8 are called middle school or junior high, unless your junior high happens to be grades 7-9 and your grade school happens to be grades K-6. Or, if you go to parochial (Catholic) school, you usually go to the same school for grades K-8, which in Chicago we call grammar school. I don't know what they call it elsewhere. Then it's off to high school, which nowadays is usually grades 9-12, often called freshman (9), sophomore (10), junior (11), and senior (12). Many high schools used to be only grades 10-12, and some specialty schools still are, like the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. Then, after high school, it's off too Uni, which we usually call college. College years are usually referred to as freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior just like high school. This is the undergraduate curriculum. Then, if you so choose, there is graduate school. This would be like the 5th year at ESADE, but it is generally longer than 1 year, and you can earn a Master's degree, or a doctorate if you study longer. So you see, it's really quite simple. The system pretty much runs like this everywhere in the country, though they might have different names for some of the schools. Got it? Well, back to work with me. Please post any and all questions concerning the above system :)  Tim

      Hola a todos, Como va pa Uds?? Al final funciona mi cuenta de blog para poder escribir aqui de verdad!!! Acabo de terminar mis clases de verano y me alegro tanto que ya se acabo. Ayer tome el examen mas dificil que he tomado en todo mi vida. Da igual para mi, la nota q recibire de la clase porque he dado todo mis esfuerzos. Pero bueno, la semana que viene voy a visitar mi familia en Acadiana (Lafayette es la capital de Acadiana)! Tb voy a una fiesta en Nueve Iberia y una en Opelousas. Eso sera la unica vacacion que tendre en mucho tiempo, pues hay que gozar! Oh yea, hay dos tios de ESADE que van a venir para estudiar en Loyola y me alegro muchisssssssimo. Gracias a Carlis estamos en contacto. Pero pobrecitos ellos... ellos tienen que vivir en lo peor residencia en todos los estados. Pobrecitos, pero lo demas sera muy bien. Ahhhh, voy a pasar un poco de info interesante de Louisiana :) Yo estaba leindo la prensa latina de nueva orleans y lei que Louisiana tiene muchos raices bascos. Nueve gobernadores del "terrirorio" louisiana fueron bascos. Nosotros tenemos casi 6,500 apellidos bascos (no sabia eso antes). Tenemos un gran influencia Basca pero no creo que eso es una sopresa para Uds si sabes que louisiana era un parte de espana y tb francia. OK bueno ya me voy, ojala que uds tengan un finde super "guai"!! Un beso!!!! Otra cosa! Hable ayer con Manolo y el se va a Miami para pasar tiempo con su novia y luego regresara a Puerto Rico!!!

      Yo!!!!!!!!  I am reaching the end of a very long working week!  It is Friday evening, half seven and I am just about to leave!  I have had a maximum of five hours sleep every night for the last week, and have spent a maximum of twenty minutes in my house apart from in my bed, and the train has become my new best friend!  But hey ho, work hard and get the rewards hey!  I am gonna go and have a nice cold pint down the pub, go for a curry with the boys and then potentially collapse and try and watch the Tyson fight, but somehow I don't think that is gonna happen!  Will try and leave a longer note this weekend, maybe provide some explanation as to why I am working these crazy hours - an insight into the world of an investment banker perhaps.........  For now, good night,  A

      I just finished watching Senator Ted Kennedy's speech at the Democratic National Convention. Bono was in attendance, in his shades of course. I do believe the internation community would've liked Ted's speech because it bashed Bush's handling of foreign policy and his alienation of long-time allies, allies which helped to win 2 World Wars. If you can get ahold of his speech online, you should check it out. I'm also told Barack Obama's speech was good, though I didn't see it. He's a Chicago boy, and he's family friends with a good friend of mine. So, in case you couldn't tell, I'm a Democrat. I'm still working on some way to sneak all of you into the country to vote, along with Luis de Sebastian, the Latin American Economies teacher. He was a big Dean supporter, but Dean is an over-emotional lunatic. I know that Ulli wanted candidate info at one point, so if you're still interested, try to find the speeches from the Democratic National Convention online, Ulli. Sidenote, did anyone know that Famke Janssen of X-Men fame is Dutch? She speaks better English than I do. She was on the Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn tonight, and I watched simply because she's hot. Sadly, Craig does not live up to the Late Late Show's illustrious international history. He's a horrible interviewer who babbles and makes piss-poor jokes. If you don't know who he is, keep it that way. Well, off to bed now. Hopefully we'll oust Bush in '04 and the world will like us again. It really does suck to travel when you see "I hate America" and "America sucks" t-shirts (as I saw in BCN), and when people hate you as soon as they hear your American accent. Oh, to be Icelandic, where they piss on the main plaza.    Tim

      Hey I was checking the official&nbsp;Barca web site and they were talking about two guys, youngsters, who are travelling with the squad to Asia and talking about the later guy, Mora,&nbsp;they said this:   Con respecto a Mora, este defensa central ha entrado a formar parte del Club blaugrana esta temporada 2004-05. Nació en Valencia el 11 de junio de 1981 y se inició en el fútbol en 1991 con el CD Benicasim y en la temporada 1993-94 se incorporó al CD Castelló, donde ha desarrollado la mayor parte de su carrera deportiva, empezando como infantil y acabando en el primer equipo.   Ok for all of you who don't know Edgar that well he is half Spanish and is dad, the Spaniard is from Castellon. So if Edgar supports one team in the world it is Castellon and I think that there are more pictures of Edgar on Castellon web page than any player in the team. Also you don´t have to know Edgar all that well to know that his last name is Benicasim. So&nbsp;does Captain Europe have his own personal team.... Respond.  Anyways got drunk last weekend, nothing much to say expect that I did hit serioulsy on my bosses sister... Goooooooooooood  Úlli

      I checked this blog every day for months and sometimes would get nothing. Now I don't check for like 2 days and I come back and there are 5 new posts. I love it!! Never thought Manolo would get a new 'do (spelling??). He got so pissed that time at Walker's. Was that the same night that Daniel and the Dutch kids broke both lifts? Bea, glad to hear that the interviews went so well. This project sounds like way too much work, but I guess you Europeans are all about large, end of term projects at Uni.     So Adam, are the late nights due to work or extracurriculars? I had a little extracurricular myself yesterday. I skipped class and work because Conor got last minute bleacher seats for the Cubs (baseball) game. Wrigley Field, where the Cubs play, is one of the oldest stadiums in baseball (1914), and the bleachers are a tradition there. All of the seats in the outfield are bleachers, and it's first come, first serve seating. Everyone shows up at least an hour before game time and gets really trashed. It's usually a bunch of twenty-somethings skipping school or work. Well, I started off with 7 or so beers on the train on the way to the game, then had at least 10 or so more at the game, so I was waxed. Then it started pouring so we all got soaked. Some of my friends (Conor included) fell several rows in the bleachers due to drunkenness. Went to an Irish pub afterwards (who would've guessed?), but it was pointless because we were too drunk to do anything. Longest train ride home ever, and then when I finally went to bed I started having drunken hallucinations about weeping willows pummeling me to sleep. Odd, I know. Had to wake up this morning at 4 to drive back down to school and finish a project by 8. Had a few Old Styles tonight (a local lager, the beer of the Cubs, brewed in LaCrosse, Wisconsin), and now I'm getting ready to hit the pit. Old Style and Strongbow makes a mean snakebite, A.     Trying to decide what's the best way to handle the blog when I'm in Bolivia. Not sure what kind of Internet access I'll have, and I don't want to forget anything that I see, so maybe I'll just write stuff down in a notebook or something until I get back. One of the guys we're going with is of European stock, but the other guy is an indio, and we get to stay with both families. It should be interesting to see the two different worlds of Bolivia. I'm thinking of all of you a lot as I get ready to head out of the country again. It seems like I should be expecting to see some of you walking around a corner in La Paz or something. Maybe they'll have a good Irish pub.....    So, funny story. This kid that I grew up with, lived down the street, came over to pick up the rest of his furniture the other day. He lived in my apartment last fall when I was in BCN, then he went to Ecuador this spring. Anyway, his name is Nsangou Ghogomu, and he's from Cameroon. He came over to pick up his large leather desk chair, his minifridge and a desk. He told me he was waiting on a car, then he would be over. He showed up and said he would just take the chair for now, come back for the fridge later. I just figured he didn't have room for the fridge in the car. So he calls 10 minutes later and says he should have a car in about an hour. I was like, "how did you get that huge chair home?" He says, as if it's the most normal thing in the world, "I had my bike." So, I'm obviously busting up laughing, picturing Nsangou riding down the street with this huge desk chair, but he thought nothing of it.  So if you see anyone riding around on a bike carrying large objects, ask them if they know Nsangou.     Now that I've officially written the longest blog ever, I'd better get to bed. Ulli, great job recruiting people. Oh, one more quick story. One of my friends, this Polish girl, went to see Poland play the US in Chicago. She said the entire stadium was filled with Polish flags and that the chants of Polska drowned out the American chanting. I guess they ran out of parking, so the Poles just left their cars in the street and walked the rest of the way to the game. I think Chicago should get representation in the EU with the number of Poles we have here.    Alright, now I'm done for real. "Do somethin!"    Take it easy,  Tim

       MANOLO HAS A NEW HAIRCUT!!!!    I just spoke to Constance and she told me that she just met Nolo the other day and he has changed haircut. I dont know how many of you were at Walkers place that day we tried to make it a little funky but the boy fought!!!! Constance is going to bring her camera to school in the next few days to take a picture and we will be getting that kind of evidence soon.   Another thing with the new look every user has a profile so please click on me to see what it looks like and if you want to make your own you can do it on the dashboard.   Later,  Úlli

      hi guys! I'm writing because I'm nervous.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I have an interview with UBS. The strange is that is not for a job, but for my research project, so I'm gonna go there and ask questions to them.. hope it goes fine! Tomorrow I'll be going to Switzerland and do the same with Rothshild, another huge Swiss Bank.&nbsp;  By the way, I'm back&nbsp;in Milan and it's 35 degress (maybe 9387 F) and awfully humid, guess what! I don't have air conditioner here... I'm melting.  I see Adam is just working and Ulli is busy with a bunch of cheeks... have fun! Bye bye Bea

      Ok since sending this mail yesterday there I have signed up Mara and Petrum and also due to a lot of problems with Bea's account I made a special guest account.&nbsp; I would like that every user has his own account but if there are problems I will give out the other login.&nbsp; Also I made Adam and Tim admins on the website so they can also sign up people and do other stuff. Last thing about the name now its "Cava and other luxuries" but if you have a better idea please do&nbsp;comment, also the about the subtitle "Barcelona unofficial fan club".  &nbsp;  Ok about my life, last week I went golfing for the first time in something like 8 years. I went with a friend of mine who's brother is a professional golfer. I did ok, had quite&nbsp; a few good strokes but in between I had terrible ones, so the total was about&nbsp;180 strokes on 18 holes. Quite fun I think Ill start golfing now, regularly.  &nbsp;  The weekend was as sweet as can be, I haven't had so much fun for weeks. I first went to a move-in party where I drank my Estrella Damm beer and spoke mostly about football with my friend from school because I didn't know much people there.  &nbsp;  Later I went to a birthday of an acquaintance of mine it was also very fun but there I spoke to this Indian-American guy (you can guess if I spoke about one particular&nbsp;friend of mine).&nbsp;Also there is this one guy I know a bit and we always talks to me while drinking and we always talk about the same thing and nothing new ever comes up... rather boring. After the party I went downtown and in the line of the most popular bar around here but they have terribly long line so I 'bailed' with a girl I worked with. I went to another bar which I usually don't go, there I met my cousin, three people I work with and other friends. To was so strange because usually I don't meet that many people I know. One of the girls I work with is so pretty and I hope that we can go on a date soon, the  move  is on the books.  &nbsp;  So now I'm just working not to much fun... but when the weekend comes...  &nbsp;  Úlli

      Yo yo, &nbsp; now Ulli, that is impressive, one email and we already have a new (and extremely gorgeous) new member!&nbsp; The charm still works over the internet eh?!?&nbsp; Suana, you are gorgeous too!&nbsp; But nice to know that our little community continues to grow, if ever so slowly..... &nbsp; I am at my desk, was another late night and early morning but I am getting used to it, becoming more of a robot every day and actually enjoying it, which is a bit sick!&nbsp; But hey ho, whatever floats your boat! &nbsp; Apart from work I don't really have much of a life so I wont even pretend that I have anything interesting to say, all I wanted to do was encourage more people to post so that at least I know that other people are doing interesting things (this is turning into a bit of a sob story!). &nbsp; Ciao for now, &nbsp; A

       Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Ciiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   HHHHHHHHHHHHooooooooooooooooooolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Yes, it's me!!!    I dont&nbsp;know from where I sould start telling you...    &nbsp;  First of all, (Adam already knows becasuse I wrote him a great email) for whom doesn't know me very well, I don't&nbsp;like staying in front of my pc and write, especialmente en ingles. Mi problema es que no me gusta mucho escribir en un idioma que no es el mio, tengo que pensar&nbsp;demasiado y me gasta mucho tiempo... just kidding!! but it's a good excuse for my spelling mistakes.    &nbsp;  I started reading what you guys have posted here, and it's really cool!!! I know that Ulli has told me at least 10 times that I should have signed in... now I join the club!!! better later than ever!     &nbsp;  Main events of my life since I've been back:   It's been really though at first (as for everybody I guess), didn't know what I wanted to do with my life... didn't know where I wanted to live... bla.. bla.. defenetly (?) a "don't know period". Thank God after about a month it was over.&nbsp; I finished my examens, and&nbsp;I started an internship&nbsp;with a pretty big Italian bank, I worked there for 3&nbsp;months in the Private Banking&nbsp;area.&nbsp; I liked it so I decided to do my final project over the same topic.&nbsp; De hecho el trabajo es sobre la synergias&nbsp;intra Private Banking y Corporate Finance en la pequena y media empresas italianas.&nbsp;   I should graduate in October, if I wont be done with the project by then, I'll graduete in December.&nbsp; It doesn't make a big difference, here the final projects are always huge works of almost 250 pages that sholud include some research as well.    El mundo de los trabajadores puede esperar un rato mas!    &nbsp;  I'm still living in Milan and I come home (Lucca, Tuscany) once in a while, usually for the weekend.    &nbsp;  During the "don't know period" I broke up with my boyfriend, after almost 2 years.&nbsp; it's not been easy to handle the consequences of that decision, but now I'm fine.    &nbsp;  This summer I'm going to Menorca with Francesca, we'll spend a week there. Everybosy says it's a beautiful place, I hope they are right.&nbsp; After that I'll be going to Elba Island with my family.&nbsp; It's a tiny&nbsp;cute island in the Mediterrean Sea, more or less in front of Tuscany.&nbsp; Dont know if you have ever heard about that, but Napoleon lived there for a while.    &nbsp;  Tim, I received your email and I can't belive you are going to get merried. I'm so happy for you and I truly wish you and your fiancee (spelling?!?!) the best.    &nbsp;  In Italy there is the bad habit of getting married too late, around 30s,&nbsp;when&nbsp;you have a safe job and&nbsp;you can afford a nice house. Your way to approch marriage is much more romantic.    &nbsp;  Adam and Ulli are working hard, Ulli told me is working in the asset&nbsp; managment division, hedge funds and stuff like that. You, Adam, are you working in the Private Banking division? After my studies I understood that UBS is the leader (at least in Europe) in the Private Banking market.. .if&nbsp;they need somebody... eh! eh!let me know!  &nbsp;  I dont want my post to be too long and tired people, I'll write again in a few days.   love to everybody    &nbsp;  Beatrice

      Beatrice,  It's great to finally see a new face on this blog. It makes my day when I check the blog and there's a new post (a sad existence, I know). And I envy you Italians for the ease with which you pick up Spanish. No hablabas espanol antes de tu llegada en Barcelona, y ahora escribes y hablas mejor que yo. I just wanted to drop a quick note for Beatrice saying benvenuti (??)...now I have to study before SIESTA TIME!!!! Take care everyone.    Tim

      Vegard, you're damn right I didn't want anyone else to snatch her up.  Adam, I thought we shared the same language. A seminarian is a man studying to become a Catholic priest. I think Lutherans call them seminarians too, at least the ones in the US. Schedule sounds rough, A. I know what you mean about the creature comforts though.  All my friends think I'm crazy for living at home next spring when I'm interning in Chicago. Same situation--hour and a half on the train, early mornings, late nights. They told me to expect 80 hours per week. But with mom doing the cooking and the laundry (when I'm home to eat or get clothes washed, that is) how can you go wrong? It's just too expensive to live in Chicago, although not as expensive as London, I think. Well, just finished a helluva week, with 2 exams, an essay due, a corporate tax return due, etc. I've been boozing all night on Strongbow cider and Coronas, I've had my IHOP (International House of Pancakes), and now I'm ready for bed.     Ciao,  Tim

      Hey everybody! &nbsp; I apologise for not blogging for a while but I have been working my arse off!&nbsp; Now I know that some of you might find that hard to believe but when you here my timetable I think you might be suitably impressed! &nbsp; I have to be at work at nine on most days, but the main problem is that&nbsp;I am still living at home which means that I have to commute into town.&nbsp; Now obviously I am glad to be home and there are certain services (ones that only mothers can provide i.e. cleaning and washing!) that I am glad to have available to me but it does take me about one and a half hours to get to work.&nbsp; Now some of you may be confused as you thought that I lived "just" outside London, well I do but our public transport system is crap so it takes forever! &nbsp; That means that on an avergae day I get up at quarter to seven to get to work..... &nbsp; This would not be half as bad if I did not have to work to past eleven in the evening as I have donw twice this week, that means that I can only catch the last train home which gets me to bed just before one in the morning.&nbsp; Now you are all clever people so I will leave you to do the maths but essentially it leaves very little time for sleep and nothing much else!&nbsp; Any remnants of a social life have been relegated to the weekend when I am invariably to tired to indulge myself fully but hey ho, gotta get used to it I guess! &nbsp; So now I am taking a cheeky few minutes off to post to you all and hope that nobody else is slaving away as hard as I am, then again the weather outside is extremely grim and there are worse places to be than in a nice warm office... &nbsp; However the beach in Port Olimpic seems a very tempting proposition right now! &nbsp; Well seeing as work is my life I don't really have much else to say, until next Friday probably, be good all, &nbsp; A

      Ulli, I knew you could spell better than you showed. Much better this time around ;)  To ease the troubled minds of Vegard and Ulli, I'll be getting married June 17, 2006 (703 days from now). I know that seems like a long time, but Kasia and I will have to be apart for a year while I'm in Champaign for grad school and she's in Chicago, so we decided to hold off until I'm done with school and can move back to Chicago.   Carles, great to hear from you man! And after seeing how well you write in English, I'm embarrassed about making you struggle to comprehend my castellano on MSN. When exactly does Vegard make his triumphant return to the Northland? Good to hear that he'll be working with people more at his intellectual level when he gets home ;)  Methinks Adam is quite busy as we've not heard from him in some time. Or perhaps he's just been on the piss for a few weeks now. Carles, thanks for the offer of accommodations, and I'm sure we'll all make it back to BCN, it is only a question of when. And the same offer stands for you here in Chicago (and anyone else for that matter). I could use some international flavour (other than Polish and Mexican, at least). Interesting fact: Chicago has more Polish people that any city in Poland except Warsaw, and 50% of the seminarians in the Archdiocese of Chicago are from Poland. At the parish where we're getting married, they offer more masses in Polish than in English. I thought perhaps I would have a reprieve from all the Polish when I went to Ireland, but when we got to Kylemore Abbey, all the people working in the cafeteria were Polish. Ya gotta love em!! Take care everyone.  Adeu, el teu amic (I just guessed on that one....Carles??), Tim

      How are you?? It seems pretty good according to what I've read so far! :)  Úlli ask me to tell you all what's going on me!  Next year is the last one of the degree!! As some of you may know, I'm going to China (Shanghai) on the exchange program (Jan 05-April 05)! And I'm so happy with it!! :P I really want to know how an exchange is like! You are so lucky!! But I'll be joining the club next year too! ;)  This summer (July & September) I'm doing an internship at McKinsey & Co in Madrid. For those of you who may have not heard of it, it is a quite well-known consultancy firm. The job is quite interesting, even though I haven't done much so far. I just hope to be joining the firm by september 05 when I finish my degree!  This haven't been the year of my life definetely, but since May things seem to be going better! I'll be telling you sth more next time! :p  I miss you all a lot! I hope you sometime stop by Barcelona again! You know that you'll have always a friend (and a bed if needed :p) in here!  I look forward to hearing from you soon!  Carles (your buddy)

      Ill try to keep this brief and badly spelled!  First of all my arse got kicked after last post, because the bilingual Stan and Lorell had some issues with spelling. I didn't have TIME, I have to work... sometimes.  Anyways, know I'm wondering, because I wrote it like there were a lot of readers....?  I spoke to Vegard yesterday on MSN where he was about to leave China for his native Norway. There he will be working with mentally disabled children, one could find more politically incorrect term for that. These Norwegians are so healthy!!  He asked me one thing I didn't know and that I would like to know... When are you, Tim, getting married?  Last weekend I didn't do anything at all. Just played Championship Manager and watched videos. Next weekend though I'm going to a party because my friend just bought his first apartment and also a girl at work invited me to come to a party. She's two years older so there might be some hot moms at that party, think I'll go to the other one.  Good for now, just the spell check left. Úlli

      First of all sorry y'all for not bloging for a long, long time. I haven't been able in work and I never bother while at home. Another reason has been that not much has been happening in my life for the last few weeks but last weekend something finally something happened.... (written later, I haven't got time for a spell check.)  First on Thursday I went to buy a bed which costs over 1,000 dollars (200*135cm). I had spoken to my friend about helping me out giving me the do-es and don't-s of that business coz he used to work in the store I wanted to buy in. Well I had sent him an e-mail but he want able to talk to me until almost six, so at five when I was walking into the store I rang him to give me the short version but hey he had just moved in with his girlfriend and had a year old bed, same size which he was willing to give me for little over a third of the price. I was so glad for the next few days.  Earlier that I ha gotten an email from the head of the asset management department that due to great results this quarter, when we became the biggest fund in Iceland, we were all gonna meet at the bar and get some drinks... free. I got there late coz I had the bed thing and was wearing the Mickey shirt that gave everyone quite a laugh, the first thing my boss said "have what you want in the bar" I replied with "I wished you'd say that more often to me" she said we should go out more often!!!  I came home at twelve after watching a depressing match where Greece made it to the final... Why god, why?!?!?!?! Not entirely sober  The day after me and my cousin moved the bed from my friends house to mine while moving  a shelf a statue fell from it and to my cousins back ... It needed stitches.  We went to the emergency room where my cousin knew everybody coz he used to work there so we got it for free, gained some 40 euros there.  Few hours later there was a welcome party at that same cousins house for him coz he´s a med student in... Hungary and just came home last Sunday. I got very drunk (has that ever happened) and in the end I think I did hit on an friends girlfriend who has been with this guy for years and years.... not good.  On the Saturday I woke up late and went to the grocery store bought some stuff and the ríkið (Icelandic for government) which is the governments alcohol store. Then I picked up another cousin of mine and his friend and we all went to my grandmothers summer house (the worst one ever, no electricity, no running water no nothing... but nice).   All of a sudden there came this song on the radio which is called I whish I had an Evil twin pretty funny.  There we BAR-b-q-ed, I got drunk and then we went to my schools camping. When I came the first thing I saw was my friend walking towards me and this girl who always "the drunk one"(that means that Im not always that person). The girl was walking little behind him and walked into a little mud fell like Chaplin it was hilarious!!! Then later that evening was two person getting it on in a car few moments later the drunk girl came and I said "knock on the door" well she did and then opened it. The couple wasn't too happy with that and when she had opened the door 5 times they locked it, so she opened the next.... classic.  I then started talking to a very, very hot girl :D who had a boyfriend in the camp :( But she was giving me gave me a lot of tips on hitting on girls:D. Then just before O left I went peeing and so did she, I just walked to the next tree (not Tim style) but the girl went further into the Forrest. Ok so when I'm pulling up the pants, an idiot that had wanted to kick my ass once before for not supporting his team comes. In the same moment the girl comes back pulling up her second pants (the ones who hold water). Ok the guy figures we were doing it, I was so pissed. Also because this girls boyfriend is a nice guy and I don't think she would leave him for me (no offence.. to me). He threatened to tell the guy and I just said go a head... He didnt.  Ok to more things there are some hot 40 year old moms here .... just for you Tim ;)  And launch is genius.  Úlli  p.s. This has become over a page on word so nouff said

      Well guys,  I will continue to blog even if nobody else will!  As you all know I left the sun and have come back to the land of rain and clouds last Friday, and returned with a storming hangover which was a must!  Nothing big on the last night, but a couple of spliffs in the ghetto (Raval), near La Paloma (we were gonna go there but the music sounded menacing on our way in so we turned around and got the hell out of there!)  I had a 21st bday on the Saturday and dutifully turned up and got suitably off my face ;op  if you ever invite me to a party with free booze you can always rely on my to get suitably smashed!  Anywho, I hope that my presence was appreciated and one day when I get some time I will put all the photos I took on Walker's website.  I have been saying this for quite some time now so when it actually happens there is gonna be a shed load of new photos on there so ch-ch-check it out!  After this final night of fun and frolics I actually started work on the Monday, my internship with UBS.  Guess what, rude awakening!  I had to be there at 8 in the morning, now this doesn't sound too bad until you realise that it takes me about an hour and a half to travel into work!  That means that I had to get the first, yes the FIRST, train into town at just before half six.  I am sure everyone agrees that we are more used to getting home at this time rather than leaving home!  So far, the week has just been training, imagine being back at school with a couple of "fun" teambuilding activities thrown in.  The kind involving coloured hats and treasure hunts etc...  It has been refreshing to actually be doing something with my days, unlike the days at the beach or in the flat sleeping off the alcohol....  I "hit" my desk on Tuesday which is what I am really looking forward to as then I will actually find out what I am gonna be doing for the next ten weeks, up to this moment I still don't really know whats gonna happen....though I do know that we have our first social tonight with money behind the bar so I will have to be very careful to control myself and not end up puking outside the bar!  Fingers crossed....  I hope Tim's arse kicking email persuades a few more people to join our "community" but we will have to wait and see.  I am gonna return to working my arse off and will check y'all later.  Be good,  A

      Today I had the most embarassing moment of my entire life.  I am still sooo embarassed that I have the jitters like woah.  So this afternoon I went to this place called CC's coffee.  I went in to get a coffee and read a book that I have and I struck up this conversation with this Dominican hottie.  So after a short while I decided that I needed to go to the bathroom and trying to be soooo cute for this hottie I managed to trip and fall and knock my coffee and his off of the table and since I was wearing a pink shirt and a white skirt I looked a hot mess with the new decorative brown stains.  I just wanted to cry, I swear... thank God the place wasnt packed but there were enough people there for me to wish it was all a horrible nightmare.  The guy, tomas, was really nice about it and he helped me up but then i looked at him and he just died laughing.  Then the employees at this place came over and had to make matters worse... there were like 3 of them and everyone in the entire shop was staring at me. Ugh, hella drama... I guess they were worried that Id try to hit them with a law suit but Im way too shame to do anything like that. I managed to hang aroung the place for about 3 terribly long minutes more to try to offer the dominican hottie a new coffee but he wouldnt take it and then I walked out and I vowed to never return to this place for as long as I live.  Why do these things happen to me?  The new news is that Bonnie should be headed towards Florida and not my way but shit I think Id rather that than what happened today.  Oh well.  Hasta la pasta hommies, and role dawgs, Im out.  Payce

      Charley is currently in Jamaica, and from about 8:00 tonight until 12:00 tomorrow it will be terrorizing the Cayman Islands.  My family is there and I just read some news about hurricane warnings.  Everytime there is a storm there, alot of people leave the island.    A little insight into the Cayman Islands...  The island itself is about 20km by 10 km and the highest point on the island is only about 20ft above sea level.  The island is basically an overgrown coral reef that was exposed when sea levels dropped a thousand years ago (whatever).   So as you can imagine, any significant storm that hit directly would pretty much wipe out the entire island.  A little insight into my family...  A few years ago when hurricane mitch (class 4 out of 5) (5 being "the perfect storm" type of storm) came through the carribbean most of the people left the island.  My mother got in to a truck and drove around the island taking pictures (one of which was shown in national geographic.)  Orignially, the hurricane was on a path for the island, but ended up veering towards honduras so they only got hit at about 75% strength.  Otherwise there would be no cayman islands, and those swiss bankers would be very happy.  Charley is currently a category 1 hurricane (the weakest of the 5 ratings) so im not too worried about them despite some island hurricane warnings.  Anyways, you can see the storm at:   urlLink http://weather.yahoo.com/img/carib_websattropir_440_mdy_y.html  ,  Grand Cayman is that little black dot between Cuba and Jamaica.

      Hey yall    Its your girl again bee login from the dizzerty. This past weekend I got everything into my new apartment in New Orleans.  Moved in all the furniture and i really like my new place.  Im living on Saint Charles Ave one of the most famous cities in the entire south (right on the parade route for Mardi Gras).  Im so happy here.  We are now deep into Hurrican season and we are expecting 2 hurricanes back to back.  One is named Bonnie and the other one named Charly.  Bonnie is in the Gulf of Mexico and Charly is in the Caribbean sea right now.  By Wednesday night we Bonnie should know what exactly Bonnie's strength should be before she hits but you can never tell.  Right now she is a tropical storm but by noon tomorrow they say it will be a full blown Hurricane (yikes!!).  Charly is predicted to be a lot stronger than Bonnie but its still too early to tell what harm and where Charly will strike.  Becuase New Orleans is so far below sea level (we are so low that we have to "bury" people when they die above the ground bc if not the bodies may come back up!) they say that a catergory 3 and higher directly on the city will cause almost unreparable damage and a catergory 4 or 5 will destroy the city.  Catergory 4 and 5s are almost unheard of but they have hit in the past (before i was born) and have caused numerous casualities and decades of repair.  They say that Bonnie will probably cross New Orleans and up towards Mississippi and Alabama that way even out to Florida.  Geeeez... time to break out the ol' New Orleans style Hurricane preparation drink.  If you dont know, the Hurrican drink is made up of white run, jamacian dark run, Bacardi 151 run, orange juice, passion fruit, vodka, and grenadine (it keeps the jitters off!).  They have not yet started speaking about evacuations but all of this still kinda gets me nervous. We always have drama for evacuations because of the highways between Louisiana and Mississippi.... the Mississippians cant get out for all of the Louisianans trying to get out and use their highways and its a big mess and all kinds shitty burauracy.  But it works out.  Oh well, all they have to tell me is go and im gone.  Ive seen enough hurricanes to know that they arent really that cool--just scary and loud like a freight train.  This whole thing kinda sucks bc tons of people are gonna have flooded homes and lose a lot of their possessions and the city will shut down for a while.  I guess thats what you get for living in a subtropical climate and the swamps :)  Ok, im outtie now... its late and i need to get up early in the AM so that I can go home to Lafayette and help my parents buy wood to board up the house from the wind and flying debris and buy sand bags for the possible floods!!! Ok, yall take care!  hasta la pasta! Sending yall lots of love... MWAH!  Oh yea, Adam and Ulli right now Im not busy as yall but when the semester begins I will have NO LIFE.  I am going to be taking 12 hours (4 classes) and working 2 jobs.  I guess that means no clubs, no long nights out, no house of blues... you get my drift. Blah. ~~ Holla Back, Ceezzz

      Hey ya'  For the last week I've been as busy as Adam. I began school on Tuesday when we began a course called Entrepreneurship and Internal Marketing with an American teacher who is just simply great, and he has begun 11 businesses and is an expert in his field. Its been really fun to get such a great teacher. The bad thing though is that we have school four times a week for three hours each time. In addition to this we have to do a rather complete business plan. Ok I still have to work at least 8 hours so time for this work is limited. Also we can not do any research because we are all busy at business hours, and no interviews can be made. So for that reason we can not use the idea that we want to. Also in addition to the business plan we do cases and I was until 1:30 in school doing it, showing up at work at 7:30... You do the math.  A little story, last year in May I said to myself "Ok Úlli now your going to get a girlfriend before you leave for BCN". When nothing had happened I called it off in late July, guess what happens in the second week of august... I meet this wonderful girl but in the end due to my departure it didn't work  I've known for sometime that this project would be difficult and I wouldn't have any life during it. Ok but I've been looking for a good girl to hook up with. So the only thing we could do before deciding on the idea was to write background description and since the teacher is American we decided to do these descriptions a little over the top on Icelandic standard. So I'm talking to my friend on Thursday and say "In the description I'm so great I'm thinking of hooking up with myself" and my friend says "Well you chose the weekend for it"... Ok I went out Friday and guess what happened....  that's all, Úlli

      Just getting ready to leave for Bolivia in a few hours. Wanted to say bye to everyone, and I'll miss the Internet. Expect a full report upon my return. Glad to hear Vegard took some wood in the ass in Mongolia, too.  Tim

      Cheerio lads and lasses,   Finally I've been freed from the chains of Chinese censorship and find myself able to post my first blog in some time. It's kind of funny how the ever so smart Chinese consider Ulli's blogspot a threat to national security and choose to ban it.   On my way back home I went up to the Mongolian grasslands for a 5-day horseback riding trip with the locals. Great experience that I strongly recommend, but they weren't obviously that used to dealing with tourists. After three entire days in a wooden saddle (no comfortable leather here) my ass was so sore I could hardly walk, but stuck in the middle of nowhere there weren't to many options. Two more days served the only purpose of changing my arse's colour from blue to purple. But the view was great, and the people despite their lack of understanding for my misery were the nicest.    So, back in Norway I'm indeed working my balls of Adam. Maybe not cracking numbers until late, but taking care of those "mentally dysfunctional children" or whatever you call it, is serious business. But I love it. Seeing those children smiling and laughing despite their every day struggles makes you realize how great this gift of life really is. Making a difference for other people is, all in all, the essence of our being.  BTW, a small quiz for our true bloggers: The Mongolians drink a lot of tea. When they drink it, they mix it with goatmilk and ..... (what other thing?)   Vegard

      hey  long time since i have had a blog on here.  im sure you all missed me.  so anyways, as some of you know, i just moved to new york on saturday.  i got  a decent gig working in corporate finance for a small company on wall street.  very interesting stuff. they are looking to go public in the next year, and i will be on the team that goes through the whole process, it will be quite educational for me.   anyways, i have only been here for four days, and i have already put in 4 - 12 hour days. cant wait till this weekend, when i get to go out and explore the city for the first time.  i am staying in this apartment right on the southern tip of manhattan.  it overlooks the statue of liberty and staten island.  (pics should be coming along shortly)  i am also one block away from ground zero. i walk by it every day, it is really weird, i get this spooky feeling every time i look in there.  you know what else is really weird.  3 cops on every corner with machine guns. as you might have heard, they also just raised the alert level here from yellow (low) to orange (high) for the financial district here in nyc. whatever that means.  what a silly system, i think it is designed just so they can claim there was either an orange alert or a high alert, depending on whether anything happens.  so, celicia is here and lee as well, if anyone remembers either of them.  i think i will meet up with them this weekend so they can show me around.  peace for now peeps.  -walker  urlLink wromanica@gmail.com  ps. i love my new gmail. i dont care if they know everything about me.

      Well, I just got back from a speech and meet & greet session with Barack Obama, candidate for Illinois' seat in the US Senate. He's absolutely amazing, and he's taking the American political world by storm. He was virtually unheard of when he won the Illinois primary in March (this basically means that he was chosen as the person whose name goes on the ballot on the Democrat side), but he still beat the other 6 candidates by over 30 percentage points. Then he was asked to deliver a speech at the Democratic National Convention last week in Boston, and man did he deliver (speech available for free on iTunes, along with all of the other speeches). He had the US abuzz for several days, and then I found out while at the pub last night that he was speaking at my uni this morning at 8 in a very intimate setting. I got up early and went, and I was not disappointed. He's witty, well-spoken, and represents the America we aspire to be yet often come up short of. His father is from Kenya, his mother is from Kansas and he grew up on the south side of Chicago, and for those of you not from the US, just take my word that that's not your everyday combination.  He rose from a "dodgy" neighborhood to attend Harvard Law, and he now teaches constitutional law at the University of Chicago, one of the top 5 law schools in the US. He's black, he's white, he's educated, he's working class and he's white collar. Many are predicting that the Democratic party is just priming him for the presidential nomination in 2012. It's about time we had an immigrant president, a black president, a president from Chicago (not Texas)! Sorry to write so much about American politics here, but Ulli loves it. I know you guys have probably never heard of Barack Obama, but you will.  A Democrat from Illinois when meeting with President Bush a little over a year ago had to explain (speaking very sloooowly and cleeeearly) that the button she was wearing said "Obama" and not "Osama," to which Bush replied, "I've never heard of him." She quickly advised him, "You will, Mr. President, you will."  Sidenote: A woman in my hometown, the wife of a policeman, currently has 2 kids under age 7, and is expecting quintuplets. Her husband is about to ship out to the war in Iraq, a war we shouldn't have been in in the first place. It's families just like these all over the US that are suffering for George W. Bush's mistakes.  (This message has been sponsored by the frustrated ravings of Tim French, and is in no way affiliated with the Democratic Party)  Tim

      Halló  I'm sitting here in the middle of the night checking out pictures from BCN and figured I hadn't bloged for a while. So I can't sleep have something in my throat and am about to work 8 hours and then go to school for something like 4 hours. Oh yes its first day of school but I still have two weeks left at work it will be hectic couple of weeks and Im almost counting on getting sick. The reason why I start now is that they have this class that we only take for three weeks and get full credit for it and I owe some. The course is called entrepreneurship and Internal Marketing and is thought by a teacher my school stole from IESE (reportedly the best business school in Spain situated very close to ESADE). Hope it will be fun.  I got a part time job at the bank I've been working at this summer which is very nice because it looks very well on a CV. The downside though is that I'm rather bored with it. I did tell Tim in an email the full story about big names in Icelandic business being my bosses and that I got great recommendations now but it was rather boring so I'm going to skip to something else.  Today (Monday) is an Icelandic day of called Traders Day-of. This is the biggest traveling and party weekend around here. Many people leave town to go camping with perhaps thousands of others and its a blast. The onces who stay at home try to have more fun than the once who left and I was one of them. I went partying on Friday, Saturday I had a bit of a cold on Friday and on Sunday my vocal cords just gave up and I could barely come up with a word anyone could hear.  Just before I came home I went to a sport bar to watch Chelsea-Milan with a friend. He had invited a friend of his who's girlfriend kissed me on Friday and we danced all night (She kissed me... To be noted). How do you handel situation like that?  Also I'm going to Hungary to visit my cousin who studies medicine there I'm also hoping to visit Adam and Edgar on the way back. It will be a 10 day trip with five days in each country. I'm going to call A tomorrow from work (its free there:D).  I think that's it for now.  Later
