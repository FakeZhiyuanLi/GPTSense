      i feel like crap, i try so hard to make things right and it never ever goes my way.  and recently some stuff has made me even sadder cuz i can't do anything about it.  SHIT why can't i make at least one person happy, and one person who would just once at least once ever care about me, i want love, i don't know what it's like to have someone love me.... i've never had it and it hurts, fuck it hurts bad.  My heart has been played with, torn out, put back in, and been broken more times than i can count.  i feel like i'm living some horrible nightmare, i'm tired of crying every night.  my faith is still with me at least and maybe someday god will give me a sign, that maybe there's something that i can do right.  -Loves-

      everything sucks a little. hell mayb a lot? :   ahem. Yeh thats whats in my head right about now.. this is what happenes when im bored too long. i start to think too much, i am my own enemy? O.O   BUT its all good. cause theres a guy here now telling me im not the whore cause im prettier than the girl i was comparing myself to. cause i have more slut pics on myspace. because im the horney girl that will say it, tahts not afraid to masterbate and knows what the fuck i want. so then the only problem is no one can give me what the fuck i want. all i can do is it trapt in this room wanting to b kidnapped, sing my song and love my freinds   i hate being sad. cause my thoughts make me sadder then i cry crying makes my throat hurt like a bitchin mofoing fuck. that makes me sadder than a shithead bum cause i cant do anything about it

      I woke up this morning in a bad mood, something isn't right today.  I've become really depressed, and been stressed out over things i can't control, even music hasn't been able to help me, actually it's made me even sadder.  My Parents are making me really mad too, my grandparents are suppose to come over today, oh this should be great fun.  Blah i'm currently listening to Cursive, i thought that would mellow me out, still is not working.  Well I feel like i'm boring everyone who reads this so i'm gonna go now.  Buh Bye  -Loves-

      You are Gluttony! Nibbling a cookie at the moment by any chance? You don't just like your food, you love it. And there's nothing wrong with that. However gluttony isn't just about food. It relates to anything that you gobble up more then you should of. You tend to 'take your cake, and eat it too' - excuse the horrific pun. Perhaps if you don't be so consumed with having every little thing you'd be better off. On a plus side, you know what you like, what you want - and you go after it. You tend to have good instincts about things, and excellent taste in your life. Congratulations, You have the best taste out of all the 7 deadly sins!   whatever this means.  -Loves-

      first im happy you find a girl. i hope shes good for you.. as if youll ever remember this but i guess i just need to let it out. i really liked you, despite the disance between us. after a while i noticed you dont talk.. not even carry the conversation.. no idea wut that was about but because of my freinds relationship with her bf, in new york made me wanted to try it but oh well.   i guess all i can say, since if at all ull b fidnthing this months later, i hope i made a good difference in you life adn knwo that there will always be someone in the world that will remember and love you forever.   im sorry.. i deleted ure mysapce link now so i wount c your profile or read your songs.. it just makes me sad.   -natasha aka mph
