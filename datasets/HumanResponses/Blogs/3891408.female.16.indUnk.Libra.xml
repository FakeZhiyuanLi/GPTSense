      Lately i have been having the time of my life...but yesterday def. wasnt one of those days. Like everything was going wrong...and now some people hate me for it.&nbsp; I wish things werent like this but they are and you just have to find a way of dealing with it or you will be misserable. So yesterday we were suppose to have another craZy asS nite....but we found out it was cancelled at the last minute...literally as we are getting in the car to leave. The we went to KJs bc we had no where else to go.Then we were gunna go to Michelles for a bondfire n everything...but as soon as Biney,Ben and Mike got there...we left for Codys. Well that was a bust so we just ended up hangin out at fast food places and driving around. Michelles was fun though..we havent done that in a long time girls...i miss all of us hanging out all the time.&nbsp; But as the night went on things got worse..and now i feel like&nbsp;shit...as a person. I hurt some people in the process of having fun...even though it really shouldnt make that much difference to me anymore...somehow it still does. &nbsp;And i know it may seem like im ok and i dont really care i do...but sometimes it just hurts too much to just sit down and think about it. Because the more i think about it...the worse i feel and then i start to regret doing what i did. But i know in the long run i did what was right...and i will be ok...and so will they. I just wish life wasnt so complicated all the time. Like i wish you could do whatever you wanted and no one would ever get hurt or anything. But in reality no matter what you do...whether it hurts you or not..you may be hurting someone else in the process. Sometimes i wish i could see what life would be like without me...like what my friends and everyone would be like. Would they all still be friends...would they be as close. You dont know the impact youve made on other people...and i wish we could see what life would be like without me..just to know...and to see if i really did make a difference in someones life. Idk anymore...i just wish life made sense again.&nbsp;

Ive been thinking alot..now that im single!! lol  And ive realized I dont remember the last time i have been this happy and free. Like i dont have to worry about hurting anyone by doing something stupid..and i can do what i want when i want. There is just so much drama with relationships and i just want to have a good time. I dont want to worry about any of this stuff..i mean im only 16...its not like im gunna marry the person i date in high school. Like you always hear about those people that marry their high school sweathearts..but they way i think of it is..you never know whats out there unless you look. Like the person of you dreams could be you best guy friend and youll never know the possibilitys. Im so just so happy i have the best friends in the whole world and they are always there for me. I really dont know what i would do without them. And we dont even fight..which is awesome bc im so sick of the drama and fighting...but with us we just want to have a good time and we dont really care what we look like or what we are doing. I know ive found people that have def. influenced my life forever and i am a better person for them. --im out--<3 you all

      Wow today was such a fun day...well most of it. I didnt get up until alost 11 then i had badminton camp from 2-5 ((which was hell if i might add))  its badminton..come on...were not at military school! lol  Then tonite i went out with Brit(who i havent hung out w in soo long) Linz n Kathy!! We saw sleepover..w then hott guy...lol  Do you like brownie!! ahahaha funny stuff. Then we went to Olive Garden and scared our waiter! "Why is that kid sitting at the bar??" lmao...thats a grown woman!! hahahahha  nice Kathy! After Olive Garden we went n visited KJ @ good ole baskin robins..and thats about it. Slow motion..ahh good song.  Im having a blah day and i havent really had time to think about anything in particular. Yesterday i had a <3 to <3 w my fav girl in the whole world Melissa...n she got me thinking...as usual! lol  Do i live my life to the fullest? I wish i could be one of those people who did what they wanted when they wanted and they had no regrets..everything does happen for a reason and whats ment to be will. But sometimes thats so hard..like not to really care about other people and to just worry about yourself...but in a way thats kinda of being selfish...but in the end you have to look out for whats best for you. Because you cant always count on other people...but you can count on youself. anyways...its still on for wed. should b a blast!! well im out XoX

      Wow i dont remember the last time i had soo much fun!! Well yesterday I had work...which wasnt that much fun. But then later on i slept over at Lindsays house. OMG girls that was a blast. Lookin at the starts and singin "Can you feel the love tonite??" lmao! almost getting caught!! ahhahah lol As for tonite..i have work from 3-close again w/ my girl Melissa then i think were meeting up with Linz n Kathy.   I have so much on my mind lately. Have you ever regreted something and wish you could go back and change it but you know if you said something to that person and you became closer again things would never really be the same?? I just dont want to look back at my life and regret anything i did or didnt do. I wanna live my life to the fullest and do what i wanna do when i wanna do it. Sometimes i wish i could turn back the time and change some things but i know things would be different now.But i always wonder what things would be like...like would you and that person you were dating..would u end up together in the end? Or that friend you are no longer friends with because of some stupid fight...still be lifelong friends?? I think you should just follow you heart and where ever that leads you...thats where you belong. Even if that means hurting someone you really love to make yourself happy.  There has been so much drama going around lately and its not necessary. I wish people would just be honest with everyone and tell them exactly what they are thinking...though that may not always be a good thing...but it would lessen the drama and conflict. The truth doesnt always hurt...its the lies that kill((so true!))

      Well this is my first of many. This seems like a good way to just say what you have to say and get on with your life. So much D-R-A-M-A has been going on lately and it really shouldnt. I mean come on were only 16 years old...we shouldnt have to deal with all this stuff. Like boyfriends and stupid people who like all that drama all the time. Ive gone through alot lately...like breaking up with my boyfriend of 7 1/2 months and ive realized if your not happy...then get out. Because as time goes on it gets harder and harder to end it. And if you think that by staying with them, hoping it will get better. It wont...take it from me. You just have to follow your heart and not always your head. And its hard sometimes especially when you head and heart are in conflict. And its like ill always love him, but the relationship just didnt last. I have the best friends in the whole world and theyve helped me get through soo much!! And i love you guys to death!! I have no idea what id do without you guys. And im soo sorry for before when i barely saw you guys but now we are closer than ever!! And i have soo much fun with you guys that i forget all the drama thats going on. My girl Melissa has to be the best friend EVER!!!Thanks hun for always helping me through stuff...weve been through soo much together. I love you to death.  The past few days have been soo much fun!! Well on Thurs. me Linz,Melissa,and Kathy were all finally able to hang out...which is like amazing because usually one of us has work. Then we all hung out at Bineys and then Andy,Cody and Ben all came over. It was soo much fun!! Cant wait for the fun nite we have planned. :)  Yesterday was fun too...minus my 9 hour day of work!! But then Melissa came over and we baked cookies...because u know us the little chefs we are lol  they were just a little on the large side!! lol   And as for today...i have work from 3-cl but hopefully ill be able to go out!! I miss hanging out w all my girls!!  well until next time <3
