      India: Can Singh Spread the Shine?   Even Bollywood, India's prolific version of Hollywood, couldn’t have produced a more dramatic script: The aftermath of the recent election in the world’s most populous democracy had enough plot twists to make a screenwriter jealous. First, in a vote held over three weeks to accommodate the country’s 1 billion-plus population, India’s incumbent prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, lost his post in a surprise upset when the Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, won the largest number of Parliament seats, though short of a majority. Voters -- especially the rural poor -- seemed to be punishing a government that had fueled great leaps in technology sectors but had left much of the population still in need of basic infrastructure and services. An aggressive election campaign by the Vajpayee government -- built around the slogan "India Shining," that highlighted the country's technological prowess -- carried little weight with tho      What do these developments mean for global companies that increasingly have been turning to India as a destination for cost-effective offshoring of activities ranging from call centers to back-office operations? Can the new government take India ’s much-touted dominance in IT and translate it into economic growth for the rest of the country? E xperts at Wharton and elsewhere offer this ass      Staying the Course Considering Manmohan Singh's track record, most observers agree that major shifts in policy are unlikely. Wharton management professor Jitendra Singh believes that reforms will continue in much the same manner as before with the new government at the helm. How these policies are communicated, however, is important. “There are interesting opportunities (and significant dangers) here for leaders in the incoming administration to signal to the business community, both in India and globally, their intentions and policies at the earliest opportunity,” says Singh.     Although the Congress campaign blasted Vajpayee’s administration for leaving most of India behind, “it is difficult to deny the progress the Indian economy has made in the last 13 years,” says Singh. “Foreign reserves are at an all time high, more than $100 billion, compared with less than $1 billion in 1991 before the reforms were initiated. Last quarter, India's GDP grew at 10.4%, faster than China's. The important challenge, going forward, will be to continue the reform process and keep growing the Indian economy, while paying more serious attention to redistribution of the gains in the economy. This is necessarily a goal that will take some time to achieve."   What impact will the elections have on the pace of reform? "Indications that the left-wing parties will not actively participate in the government may lower pressures for populist programs that could lead to greater deficits. But the same pressures may come from other coalition members, who will have their own favored themes. This will be a great challenge to the Congress leadership," says Singh.     Of course, the mainstream Indian left-leaning parties are rather different from traditional left wing parties, notes Sam Pitroda, former adviser to prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and first chairman of India ’s telecom commission. “The Communist parties have the interest of the poor at heart, but they understand that foreign investment is important. I don’t think they will be against the policies, even if they have some different ideas on what to privatize and so forth.” For example, the New York Times recently reported that West Bengal, a state that has had a Communist Party-led government for more than 25 years, has been makin      At present, companies that are outsourcing functions to India have little to worry about from the power change, Singh notes; it’s investors who need to feel reassured. "Much will depend on whether the government finds itself in a strong, stable coalition or in a more unstable, weak position. The latter will certainly influence their ability to act decisively and in positive ways to reassure portfolio investors who have invested sizable amounts of money in Indian financial markets. This is the 'hot money' that can leave the country rather quickly, if better conditions are perceived elsewhere. The outsourcing relationships tend to be more medium- to long-term, and are      Ravi Aron, a professor of operations and information management at Wharton, says that the impact of the new government may take time to be felt. “An immediate concern is: How will the new government’s policies affect infrastructure enablers of globalized services – such as telecom, power, and transportation?” he says. “Assuming the government is not doctrinaire and doesn’t choke down because of ideological reasons, the impact will be minimal at the moment. But if scarce resources like power are given away without regard for optimal and efficient use, then there could be serious consequences. On the positive side, removing barriers on supply and distribution in sectors like telecom would be a huge enabler.”     India also needs to respond to the growing clamor for protectionist policies elsewhere, says Aron. “As the U.S. faces mounting domestic pressure over outsourcing, India needs to be able to negotiate agreements to make sure that opportunistic government behaviors – like anti-outsourcing legislation in a    Mukund Ramaratnam, director of business transformation at Advanced Micro Devices, a company that has significant IT operations in India, agrees that the country is unlikely to stray far from the road it’s on. “We believe future governments will support the strides made. Certainly people may pause in making decisions, but the growth path is so clearly laid out. Those growth engines are not going to stop.”     Wanted: A More Inclusive Revolution Keeping the engines of reform running while making serious efforts to improve conditions for the majority of Indians will be far from simple, especially if there is a return to some level of government intervention. “The key issue that helps explain the election results is that the public at large has not seen the benefits of India's gains as much as perhaps the middle- and upper-income segments have,” says Singh. “This will be a key challenge going forward. Important themes ought to be better education at the primary level, better health care, and greater development of the parts of India that are lagging behind. However, it would be a mistake to see this in opposition to the goal of continuing economic reforms. The di      As voters seem to have expressed, outsourcing and IT, after all, may boost the economy but don’t directly feed a hungry mouth. “Now that we have gained some confidence, the key is, how do we effectively focus on sanitation, the environment, education, and health?” says Pitroda. “A lot more attention must be paid to these needs, and we’ll have to create more jobs in these areas.” Part of the solution, he adds, may be to focus more on the local level. “We need to push for more district-level development, and decentralize more and more of it. There’s great news coming out of cities like New Delhi and    Still, it’s important not to lose sight of the actual numbers, says Aron. “India saw many lower middle class jobs created, many people lifted out of poverty, and a great decline in inequality in the last four years. If you turn your back on growth and say the government was voted out with a mandate, the great danger is that you will end up lifting fewer people out.”     Ramaratnam, too, believes that growth and development are not mutually exclusive. “We believe that the global progress of technology-enabled customers will have a positive impact on everyone. The big question is, how do you make this revolution really inclusive, so it reaches a wide group of people? I think we need to figure out ways to make a difference using technology. Having that kind of big-picture thinking – taking this thing with amazing potential and harnessing it for the needs of a huge cross-section of people – is important. We should encourage such thinking across the entire government structure, and make it part of the fabric of the revolution.”    From the Current Issue

      My family tells me that at 4 I told them that I was going to America. I apparently told my mom that I will bring her back a sari, a promise I have had the privilege of fulfilling.  In an ancient and tiny village in South India, I imagined a country where people could be themselves and it was ok as long as it didn’t hurt anyone else; understandable fantasy perhaps for one brought up in a rigidly traditional religious culture which is the lot of most of the world still. No matter what the religion or place, fundamentalism is the life experience of most of the world; I was surprised recently to meet someone brought up in a Buddhist fundamentalist group; an oxymoron one would have thought. F is a bend of mind that seeks to have certainty of consensual reality at the expense of ‘ reality’ itself and sacrifices personal authenticity, having decisions made for us based on ‘ knowable absolutes’; avoids responsibility for the decision, but provides certainty and avoids existential despair of confusion and tough authentic individual decisionmaking in each situation. It is more a malady of a fearful mind than it is of necessity anything other it is purported to be.   The problem is that as soon as a person accepts an external authority and especially if he/she believes that somewhere in time and place the Almighty placed on them the privilege of being the ‘ the chosen’ to receive the whole understanding of Himself, very suspiciously, hardly ever Herself; automatically and domino like a number of corollary beliefs and actions are set in motion, such as persuading the ‘ non-chosen’ or even eliminating them as historyattests to. A suffocation of creativity and imagination takes place in most of the societies around the world, kids in villages around the world where they can’t just be themselves and it is ok.  Once the original premise of ‘chosenness’ is accepted, and usually an authority having been assigned to arbitrate and articulate the ‘ Truth’ the true believer has virtually no choice or will left but to follow through with the corollary beliefs and behaviors. Usually arbitrated by priests and or governments, fundamentalist thinking once set in motion has no choice by logical extension other than to treat “ others’ as needing persuasion or control.  America represented a radicallydifferent kind of idea to me very early, perhaps under 10 years of age, even where I lived in remoteness and obscurity.. A secular society that believed in equality, liberty and human fraternity; without the oppressive consequences of any fundamentalistic society! The american constitution when I read it in my teens seemed to represent the pinnacle of positive human imagination, apparently recognizing we live or perish together, they were at least able to imagine the affirmation of equality and liberty for themselves within their country.   Proof existing across academic and scientific disciplines confirming our interconnection as a planet for better and for worse; a crtical mass of people are beginning to recognize this reality in spite of “ conservatives’ in all countries perpetuate the concept and future of the sovereignty of the “ nation state’ a concept established in nineteen century Europe that if you segregated people by ethnicity/language, with exceptions of federations like Switzerland, there will be less problems.  It also gave rulers the virtual divine right to do what they jolly well pleased within their sacred ‘internationally recognized’ borders as in Rwanda, Germany and Serbia as elsewhere. People in the world have intuited, if not recognized that the fact of our interconnection and interdependence has rendered such thinking dangerous to all our survival, between a conglomeration of vested interests and their powerful lobbies everywhere in the world and  ‘ head in the sand thinking ‘, we also have resistance to change,  a perennial human trait sometimes even until too late.  So, America by its own self-understanding as well as perhaps propagandizing and sloganeering over the past 50 years , got the attention of kids like me everywhere in the world;  in our hearts we wanted to be American, not always in geography, but what it represented; true justice and rule of law is virtually unimaginable in most of the world leave alone ‘ inherent human rights ‘ or the right to ‘ pursue happiness’ as one sees it.  In my teens, I began to find out about all kinds of scullduggery Amerca was involved in,  during the cold war, thought they had something to do with the suspicious death of Patrice Lumumba in Africa in a plane crash. In ensuing years I heard about the grievances of so many people and nations and peoples about what America had purportedly done to them, from Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia, Cuba, Phillipines, Guatemala, Africa, virtually everyone seemed to have a grievance about how America did them dirt.   At first I was not prepared to accept that my ‘ idol had clay feet’  I said, surely self-interest and the pursuit of happiness by America in the world should not be a problem, I argued; it even help those people. Then a darker picture began to emerge and persists. At the very least America has not been true to its ideals I so fantasized about, either in its own country as demonstrated by ongoing inequalities and discriminations; the richest nation in the world who believes in equality allowing 40 million of its people to be without medical insurance, a country who has the most punitive and ineffective prison system, and yet refuses to address the root causes of mostly the poor and minorities being warehoused and further damaged causing more crime and they simply don’t seem to be able to see the injustice of this way of thinking.   Just yesterday cnn reported that tens of millions of dollars designed to improve national security was legally and properly given to oil companies rolling in billions as a result of the present global situation while public security need could not be funded for public transit systems. There seems something wrong, very wrong with the way America has interpreted its ideals as represented in its own constitution, still the best of human imagination, goodness and good will as ever represented in a single document in the history of human civilization.   It is right for America to tout these principles as sacrosanct but it doesn’t seem to realize that it has been losing its moral authority for a very long time internationally because of its perceived perpetuation of and active collusion with unjust dictators whose karma has become mingled with America’s.  Now how.did this nation with the noblest of articulated principles end up in a situation that appears to be the very definition of hypocricy itself. Not that other nations or all nations are not prone to all the same ills, but America said  200 years ago that it was different, has been shouting it ever since; some of us all over the world, the oppressed masses imagined America the Land of the Free and then they found that the’ emperor has no clothes’ and feel misled and lied to. Their fantasies were dashed and they psychologically project it on to America in an exaggerated way. They cannot reconcile how America’s unreasonable demand that they have an ‘inherent right’  to cheap oil while even people in producing countries have been paying 3, 4 and 5 dollars a gallon for years.   People almost universally suspect that this is why America has been in bed with and therefore party to the torture and oppression of the mostly family dictatorships who are always easier to deal with than a democracy in which the deals with America will have to be openly discussed. America for business reasons has found it much more convenient to deal with totalitarian dictatorships dozens of whom were perceived to have been creatures of America. The question is ‘How does America assert ‘ moral authority’ again in the hearts and minds of people and kids like me in remote cities and villages all over the world for whom America was more than a place on the map. It is for human rights; but its best friends have always been exempt. Illegal settlements are sanctioned as ‘ facts on the ground’ All nations except Isreal are pursued for developing Nuclear weapons; and America wants to be seen as an honest broker! How are people to make sense of this.   As a person who has worked with people from most countries in the world, I get to talk to people from all continents and from virtually all countries, I have an unscientific but intuitive feeling that America is genuinely in trouble all over the world, even with its friends and allies . I believe many objective polls say the majority of people on the planet do not trust America and its motives or rhetoric, they are becoming afraid of America and mistrust is fast moving toward hatred in and among even the most unlikely and up to now politically disinterested common people everywhere it seems.  What Americans just don’t seem equipped by their history to understand, is that unlike Americans with very short term memories, most of the world has very long memories. They are shocked that,  when Americans or foreigners are captured in Iraq for instance , they are generally asked 3 questions, are you Americans, are you Jewish/Isreali, are you Catholic; why catholic, the Crusades are still in their consciousness and seek revenge for it.  They also make connections Americans don’t like, they have connected the dots such as your behavior all over the world in American  ‘ national interest’ has at least ignored, if not contradicted and hurt their personal and national interests. People connect the dots themselves, sometimes based on a mix  information, misinformation, propaganda and paranoia.  Yugoslavians know about American role in Bolivia as well as Afghanistan, Iran and Chile. It is time America woke up and recognized that the ‘ empire’ may be brought down by the barbarians’ again as happened to Rome and sooner than americans with their ‘ heads in the sand’  will recognize it I am afraid.  A modest proposal  An America initiated Truth and Reconciliation Commission on America and its behavior the world as it relates to its ideals represented in its Constitution.  All the people who perceive themselves as having been negatively impacted due to perceived and purported  American actions or inactions should be able to bring it to the Commission which will work in the spirit of the South African model,  a triumph of forgiveness, imagination and common sense that perhaps saved hundreds of thousands of lives and allows that nation to pursue its destiny as a multiracial democracy.  Confession and repentance is at the core of all faiths; because it heals the spirit and repairs and reconciles relationships. I polled a wide range of ordinary people from around the world about this idea. Not one thought it was a bad idea, all thought or said, “ not America!’.They don’t feel America has the courage to confess, a primary requirement of any repentance.   Most nations, if not all nations, have acted as badly or worse than America some time in their histories. That is not the issue. America has been caught like other ‘ empires’ have been caught, right in the act, partly because of the explosion of information and media communications over the past 50 years around the world.  For most people I talked to, it is hard to imagine America changing its course that radically to get back in line with its own purported and much publicized ideals which when seen repeated on tv is mostly greeted by yawns and sarcastic rolling of the eyes by ordinary people from all over the world; this is not good news. Think about it; the world is looking for clarification on which America they are dealing with, the one at least attempting to correct its course to better align with its own ideals or the greedy and unjust hypocrite that will do anything,  moral or immoral to achieve its national interests and prosperity ? Lacking the moral authority to dig itself out of the hole it strayed into while espousing and pursuing the greatest of human ideals as represented in its own Constuition . In business and international affairs, and when protecting its prosperity and self interest, will America, a nation born of ‘ moral’ principles, get back to its own roots, is the real question.   America can buy itself a brand new chance, start a new page if it wants to, but only if it finds a way to confess and repent, like all people everywhere caught in a jam of having been publicly caught being incongruent with who they say they are and want to be.  My own sense is that a forum however sanctioned or informal will evolve, in fact is evolving as we speak, that is going to connect the dots about American behavior internationally and within its borders for congruence with its articulated words and ideals.   America still has a chance to channel this negative energy into a healing process for itself and indeed the world and retake it rightful and important place as a people who believe in justice, equality and fraternity; in fact it seems there is still a place at the head of the pack with its name on it; will it confess, repent and lead again?!  There are still hundreds of millions around the world who are ‘americaphiles’  like me who are not only willing, but anxious to give America another chance; don’t know if America will have the courage and humility to seize it; only time will tell.

      " Blogging will fundamentally change the (way) people interact with media and politics and provide us with an opportunity to overhaul our outdated democracies   Business opportunities Blogs have been rapidly growing in popularity in Japan, catching on especially in the past year at a pace that's believed to lag only the United States. At least a dozen companies in Japan provide blogging services. Internet service provider Nifty, which licenses Six Apart's software, has drawn about 25,000 bloggers.  Most of the blog services are free so far. But once blogging gains acceptance as a self-publishing medium, business opportunities such as advertising and premium photo-sharing services should emerge.  Ito has yet to launch a specific moneymaking service for bloggers, but he has created a Neoteny blogging team to feed the fad.  Blogs here look similar to those in the United States. People comment on the news and music, pass around jokes, rate restaurants.  In a society that emphasizes conformity and harmony, blogging makes it easier for people to express unpopular opinions and get tangled in emotional debates.  "The thing neat about weblogs is you find each other," Ito said. "It gives you a feeling of empowerment. For grass-roots movements and things like that, it will be great."  Junjiro Hara, who has known Ito for decades, is sold on blogging and prefers it as an outlet for his views than his real job at major newspaper Asahi Shimbun.  "Japan can't change for the better until it becomes a place where everyone starts blogging," Hara said.  Natural fit For Ito, promoting blogging came naturally in a life already devoted to bridging Japanese and American cultures.  Ito was born in Japan but spent parts of his childhood in Canada and the United States because his father worked abroad. While in Japan, Ito attended international schools. He became fluent in English and Japanese while always feeling slightly outside mainstream Japanese society.  Ito joined friends from international schools in creating Japan's first Web pages.  "People thought we were crazy. But we had great confidence because we saw that it was going to be giant one day," said Cyrus Shaoul, one of Ito's international-school buddies. "The point wasn't to make a lot of money. The point was to change the world."  Ito believes blogging will one day prove as influential as the printing press.  "Blogging will fundamentally change the (way) people interact with media and politics and provide us with an opportunity to overhaul our outdated democracies," he said.

      I always get a lot of questions about mentoring and suggestion for job searching for young graduates. I have have helped individual person to the best of my abilities. May be It has come to a time to complement formal career placement efforts of schools and universities.  I will try to list all the suggestions and methods that hs been useful to me and others.  The most Important things I think are the following:  1.0 Be yourself, do not try to get a job you do not like. It is a waste of your life. 2.0 Be informed, I mean gather info from Google and webfrret etc. News paper and TV is bit outdated. 3.0 Be Passionate about your tarde and Profession. And Stick to your Trade and profession. 4.0 continually Upgrade yourself. End of your formal education prepares you for life long self study. Make a habit of hanging around bookstore and libraries on Saturday. 5.0 If regular employment is difficult look for volunteer opportunity or go freelance at guru.com  6.0 Have Positive Mental Attitude-- More on this stuff latter.  7.0 Ask me hard and direct questions- or may be you should ask your self questions.  8.0 At end of the day just check- what got accomplished and what new thigs you have learned. or even how you can be efficient.   These are my personal thoughts. So Feel Free to comment.
