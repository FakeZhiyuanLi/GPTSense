       Mission Is God Sending The Whole   Church   With The Whole   Gospel   To The Whole   World   To Meet The Spiritual And Social Needs Of Humanity.    1. The Purpose Of   Jesus   Dying On The Cross Is For World Mission.   Jn 3:16 For God So Loved The   World   That He   Gave   His Only Begotten Son, That Whoever Believes In Him Shall Not Perish But Have Everlasting Life.  1 Jn 4:10  In This Is Love, Not That We Loved God, But That He Loved Us And   Sent   His Son To Be The Propitiation Of Our Sins.  Heb 12:2 Looking Unto Jesus, The Author And Finisher Of Out Faith, Who For The   Joy   That Was Set Before Him Endured The Cross, Despising The Shame, And Has Sat Down At The Right Hand Of The Throne Of God.   2. The Purpose Of Being A   Child   Of God Is For World Mission.   Gen 1:28 Then God Blessed Them, And God Said To Them,"Be   Fruitful   And   Multiply;     Fill   The Earth And   Subdue   It; Have   Dominion   Over The Fish Of The Sea, Over The Birds Of The Air, And Over Every Living Thing That Moves On The Earth."  Jn 15:16 You Did Not Choose Me, But I Chose You And Appointed You That You Should Go And   Bear Fruit,   And That Your Fruit Should Remain, That Whatever You Ask The Father In My Name He May Give You.   3. The Purpose Of Your   Calling   Is For World Mission.    Phil 3:17(TLB) (Paul:) "Dear Brothers,   Pattern   Your Lives After Mine, And Notice Who Else Lives Up To My Example."   4. The Purpose Of   Pentecost   Is For Mission.    Acts 1:8 (Jesus:) "But You Shall receive   Power   When The   Holy Spirit   Has Come Upon You; And You Shall Be Witnesses To Me In Jerusalem, And In All Judea And Samaria, And To The End Of The Earth."   5. The Purpose Of The   Church   Is For World Mission.   Mt 28:18-20 (Jesus:) "All Authority Has Been Given To Me In Heaven And On Earth.   Go Therefore And Make Disciples Of All The Nations,   Baptizing Them In The Name Of The Father And Of The Son And Of The Holy Spirit, Teaching Them To Observe All Things That I Have Commanded You; And Lo, I Am With You Always, Even To The End Of Age." Amen.   6. The Purpose Of   Prosperity   Is For World Mission.   Deut 8:18 And You Shall Remember The LORD Your God, For It Is He Who Gives You Power To   Get Wealth,   That He May Establish His   Covenant   Which He Swore To Your Fathers, As It Is This Day.   7. The Purpose Of Jesus   Delaying   His Second Coming Is For World Mission.   Mt 24:14 (Jesus:) "And This Gospel Of The Kingdom Will Be Preached In   All The World   As A Witness To All The Nations, And Then The End Will Come."  Acts 17:30 "Truly, These Times Of Ignorance God Overlooked, But Now Commands   All Men Everywhere   To Repent.  Interesting Facts: ~Of The 6.1 Billion People In The World, 2 Billion Are Christians. ~240,000 People receive Christ Every Day. ~Asia Forms One Quarter Of The World's Surface Area. ~61% Of The World's Population Lives In Asia. ~Half The World's Population Are Found In 5 Asian Countries: China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan And Bangladesh. ~6 Out Of The 10 Largest Cities In The World Are Found In Asia: Tokyo, Bombay, Calcutta, Shanghai, Dhaka + Delhi. ~Asia Is The Least Evangelized Continent With More Than 83% Of All Non-Christians Living Here. ~In India, 50% Of The Population Are Under 15 Years Old. ~In China, 40% Of The Population Are Under 18 Years Old. ~40% Of The World's Suicides Are In China Alone.

Acts 2:44-45 Mat 6:19-21 }  Combines To Form... Mat 22:39   }  Acts 4:32 ~No Poverty Exist In Church...
