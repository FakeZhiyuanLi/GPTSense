       Song of the Moment ::  Cold by Matchbox 20  Driving Days until Test :: three, I'll let you know when it changes.  [start: 11:10pm]  I never get a chance to just talk about the little quirks that make me me. So here's a whole twenty mintues of random facts about me. Number one, I absolutely hate seafood. It's gross, it smells, and I refuse to eat it. Number two, I'll never understand why it's important if the chicken came before or after the egg. As long as one of them came first, who cares? Three, I will only drink chocolate milk if it came from a store. I don't like chocolate milk that you make at home, even though it's basically the same thing. Four, I've never ridden a rollercoaster. I want to but the oppertunity has never presented itself, so to speak. Number five, I love boys - they're stupid. Six, I have a very obsessive personality, so when I'm into something (or someone...) watch out. Seven, I have a weird habit of always being polite to strangers, no matter how pissy a mood I'm in or how rude they are to me. I'm getting better about telling rude people to back off, though. Eight: I hate the noise a dial-up connection makes when it's connecting to the internet. Nine, I took keyboarding in eight grade. I still type at over 50WPM. Ten: Maroon 5's Adam Lavine can sing his songs to me any time, even though they're mostly perverted. With a voice like that, who cares?  Number eleven, I can't tell time from a normal clock without actually studying it and thinking about it. Number tweleve, I always spell remember wrong the first time I write or type it. I usually leave out the second "m" for some reason. Number thirteen, I'm a font whore. The more fonts, the better! Fourteen, someday I want to get a zebra just to say "I have a zebra" when somebody asks what pets I have. Fifteen: I can count to thirteen in Spanish. I can also count to ten in ASL. ;) Number sixteen, my older sister's roomate is my unofficial sister. I've known her my whole life so we might as well be sisters anyway. Seventeen, I get along well with people younger than me. I guess I can relate to them. Number eighteen: My favorite color combo is black, hot pink, and white. Coincidentally, those are also my favorite colors. Nineteen: I have a build-a-bear named Loverly that my aunt bought me for my sweet sixteen. Twenty: My mousepad has green and blue dots arranged in a semi-phsycadelic pattern.  Twenty-one: I drink too much soda. I know I shouldn't, but I do. Twenty-two, along with this blog, I also keep a paper journal and a meditation journal. It helps me organize my thoughts. Number twenty-three, I'm getting really tired of typing numbers. Twenty-four, I have a puppy that I adore and would die without. Number twenty-five: I like dogs better than people. Dogs don't judge, are good listeners, and at the end of the day are still going to love you regardless. Twenty-six: It's all about the eyes. Most days I wear lots of eyeliner and my look is smokey. Twenty-seven: I have a computer, a DVD player, a VCR, a TV, and a stereo in my room. We aren't rich, however; I bought almost all of it with my own money. Twenty-eight: I wear glasses. Most times I go out in public I leave them at home, though, because I don't like wearing them. Twenty-nine, I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Thirty, I leave WinAmp on almost constantly.  OK, so this has actually only been 15 mintues, but I'm tired and I'm going to bed. Night, y'all.

       Song of the Moment :: Bring the Night On, Eve 6  Driving Days until Test :: three, still three.  Today was a rather frustrating day. We went out to Copper Canyon to volunteer at Rabbit Rescue (keep in mind it's a 45-minute drive or so), and when we got there, nobody was friggin' home. Diana, who's the owner of the place, knew we were coming, but stil there was nobody there. We hung around for about 30 minutes but nobody showed up so we left. Grrr.  Thanks to  urlLink humanforsale.com , I now know how much I'm worth. I also know that I'm worth more as a chick, because if I were a guy I'd be worth exactly $1,693,022.00. Ha!

       Song of the Moment ::  This Love by Maroon 5  Driving Days until Test ::  um, still three. har har.  I'm volunteering at Rabbit Rescue tomorrow with Val. As far as I know we'll just be doing the same thing as last time (feeding, watering, etc). There was supposed to be an adopt-a-rabbit tomorrow (today, actually, I guess) but there are still some problems being sorted out. I don't care though, anything I get to do there is fun. Hehe. I just love volunteering, even when it's as unglamourous as cleaning cages and changing the water. All the rabbits are so cute that it really makes up for any hard work we have to do.  I saw 50 First Dates today, it's really good. I was cracking up almost the entire movie, although when I stopped to think about it, it was really sad that she had to be reminded every day that she was married, and that she was a mother, and even that she had to be reminded of these things. I would hate to be involved with somebody like that. Love should be effortless.  Well I need to be getting to bed, so good-night.

       Song of the Moment ::  My Dad's Gone Crazy by Eminem f/daughter Hailie  Driving Days until Test ::  THREE! ho, who would've guessed?!  Wow, it's early and I haven't slept at all. I've been online this whole time (since about 10:30pm). M&D would be pissed if they knew, but they don't even know this blog exsists. I guess it wouldn't help that I'm not even supposed to be online on my computer, since I can't hear the phone if it rings. Oh well, I really doubt anyone will be calling at nearly 4am anyways.  Right now I'm watching a show on TBS about some black family (said in a completely nonracist tone). I don't have the slightest idea what it is, but it's the only thing on right now. Well, except slutty music videos, but I'd much rather listen to WinAmp, thank you.  I really should go to bed.  Why don't I just go to bed?  Because I want to be able to say that at least once during the summer I stayed up so late that it ventured into no-man's land, into the territory of college students, truck drivers, and drunks. Ha!  Why do they call it no-man's land?  And who the fukk is they?    RIGHT NOW     mood ::   almost  tired  listening to/watching ::  WinAmp playlist - Christina Aguilera's Dirrty  eating/drinking ::  just had some tortilla chips, am still hungry  talking to ::  nobody! it's 4am!  thinking about ::  uhhhh brain. devoid. of thought.  wishing ::  that ****** would call!  wearing ::  same thing as last post, ha.

       Song of the Moment ::  Anxiety by the Black Eyed Peas  Driving Days until Test ::  three; hasn't changed.   [start: 11:30pm]  Why are some people so damn close-minded about music? It's like, I like country only which means it is not possible to enjoy a song catagorized as rock. Just because a song isn't the "genre" you like doesn't mean it isn't good. What exactly is a genre, anyways? It's not like there's a song on this planet that really fits into one seperate catagory. Well, I'll eat my words; any of Britney Spear's songs can be classified as pop and only pop. However, take the song I'm listening to right now: I Feel Fine by Riddlin Kids. If you've ever heard this song, you would know that it isn't exactly punk, rock, or alternative. It certainly isn't pop or hip-hop. So what does that make it? It makes it whatever you, as an individual, decide that it is. Just because I don't think it sounds punk doesn't mean the next person that comes along won't.   Another thing is when people say oh, I like such-and-such band, they're so [instert genre description here]. Let me ask you something. Have you ever, ever heard a band in which every single on of their songs sounds like it could be in the same genre? Here's an example. I love the Black Eyed Peas. Their sound is edgy, fun, and samples a little from a lot of genres. The one genre you would normally never associate with the Peas - other than country, that is; forget country music even exsists for the purpose of this article because I honestly do not like country music and I also honestly believe it is possible the only classifiable kind of music - is rock. Well, I bought their CD the other day and was incredibly surprised to find that song eleven, Anxiety, is actually a rock-out, crank-it-up, kick-ass song. As it turns out, its my favorite song on the CD, maybe for the simple reason that it was unexpected. So now, I can't really say B.E.P. is funk or whatever, because I now that they aren't always that specific genre. A person hearing Anxiety as their first Black Eyed Peas song would assume that the Peas are hard rock, possibly alternative. However, a person hearing Where Is the Love as the first B.E.P. song they've heard would assume that they're pure pop. So you really can't define a band by the music they play.  Music is possibly the one thing this world agrees on: it's good. What nobody seems to agree on is what kind of music is best, what genre such and such band is, what music needs more good songs, and so on and so on. It's a perfect subject for debates, conversations, bonding. When you really think about it, this world revolves around music. Without, think how many things would cease to exsist. Fan clubs, the radio, a ton of websites, MTV (well...or not), the Grammys. However, there's a possibilty that a lot of violence would go away as well. Take Eminem's Sing for the Music, which says, "They say music can alter moods and talk to you, but can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?" All of this is very true. Critics blame the man himself, Eminem, for a lot of this world's violence problems. Or at the very least they blame the angry lyrics in his songs. But we have to ask ourselves, if we know the music is going to effect us how it is, why do we listen to it? The reason is that the music is everywhere we go. It is impossible to get away from music. Music is everywhere. It's like oxygen for your ears, except that only the most extreme cases will ever die from lack of music. So why bother trying to classify it, or stick a lable on it? Music is music, and if that's all you did all day - put this song into this genre and that song into that genre - you would have no life and you just wouldn't  enjoy  the music. Isn't that the whole point?

       Song of the Moment ::  Fill Me In by Craig David  Driving Days until Test ::  three...  [start: 11:22pm] Okay, since Mom has cancer I know a ton about how it can affect people's lives. At least, Iknow how it's affected us, and the people my family is close to. It's true that some positive cn come out of it, but for the most part it's an extremely negative experience. Things will never be the same around here, or at least not for a very long time. By the time things settle down again, I'll most likely be off to college. So, in reality, things are never going to be how they were last summer, before Mom found out about her cancer. It's a terribly sad thought. By the time Mom's cancer is in remission, I'll be nearly 18 and preparing for college, Chels will be in high school, and just everything else in general will be different. The innocent, carefree part of my life is officially over. I envy people who still have a few years left to be kids. My mom's cancer has forced me to face the creul reality that is our world much too early. I miss the days when the most stressful thing I had to worry about was my grades (still important, don't get me wrong), and the days when a big scary monster such as cancer was just one of those things that you hear about happening to other people, think how sad it is, and go on with your life. Newsflash, for those people, life  doesn't  go on. At least, not like it did before. Cancer changes everything. You realize how precious life is, how easily things can do a 360, how you can never get back the "good old days."   I was in the car, on the way home from Wal-Mart with Mom, and I was thinking about when I was little. I mean, 16 isn't old by anyone's standards, except maybe a child's, but I'm talking about when I  was  a child. It was fun, going back and remembering. Just really thinking about that time in my life - nearly ten years ago. Then, it occured to me. In another ten years, I'll be 26. Chances are, I'm going to do the same thing I did today; look back and remember. Then I thought, but will I be smiling fondly, like I did today? Or will I be sad thinking of this time in my life? If I have a choice, I pick the latter. I do not want to look back on my teenage years, the "best years of my life," and regret what I did or didn't do. I want to get out there and  live . I want to just be a kid.   Easier said than done, however. It's virtually impossible to just be kid now. I may be able to go out and have a blast with my friends and forget about stuff, but at the end of the day, I still come home to this...twisted reality that's bcome my life. I still have to come home and face my personal demons - my depression, just to name one of many. I still have to come home and remember that no matter how hard I try, I will never, ever be able to forget that my mother could be dying. She isn't, but she well could be. Cancer does kill, which is a thought that is scary as f*ck to admit. Plus, there's a 98% chance that even looking back on this time in my life, I'll just get sad.  It's funny. Even though I've been depressed for almost a year now, I never knew what it was like to truely be sad, to be cry-until-your-eyes-run-dry, stay-in-bed-for-days,  hopelessly sad. Until recently. I don't want to really go into what exactly pushed me to this point, but it is possibly the worst feeling in the entire world. Worse than feeling unwanted, worse than feeling let down, worse than a broken heart. It doesn't exactly help that all of these things can lead to being sad like this. I'm still sad, thinking about it now, but it's nothing like how I felt. It's like your sadness is so intense, so very real, that it feels almost like somebody has your heart in a death grip and is twisting...and twisting...and twisting. I'm just extremely glad my depression didn't include that particular syptom, because it is how a lot of people feel when they're depressed. I got lucky (if you can call it that) that although I had a lot of symptoms of depression, extreme sadness was never one of them. Hopefully nothing will ever happen that will change that.

       Song of the Moment ::  Ocean Avenue by Yellowcard  Driving Days until Test ::  still three.  I am so tired right now, it isn't even funny. Well, I suppose it is since it's completely my fault. I was up until 1:30 watching Thelma & Louise on TBS (good movie, sad ending but I loved it), then Chels and I watched Street Smarts until 2. So I finally got to bed around 2:15. Then Mom got me up at 9:30, yuck. I'm really going to have to start at least attempting to get back on schedule. Bed at 10, up at 6-6:30...Who am I kidding? I love staying up! And it's not like I can't function when I'm tired. Although, I do feel a hellva lot better when I'm well-rested. Oy vey.  I've decided that I need to take charge of this f*cking depression. I've been battling it for almost a year now, and it's about time I start really dealing with it. Maybe it's time to start a twelve-step plan or something. Actually, as lame as that could be, it might help. I'm going to work on that.  Sometimes it feels like the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that it would absolutely tear my family apart if I were to commit suicide. I hate that I don't feel like I have more to live for, but at the same time I feel lucky that I have  anything  to live for. Depression is a bitch in that you really don't know how to express yourself (such as now, I suppose) and that even when you do know how, you don't really want to. It's like it's easier to just keep it inside and try to ignore it away then it is to talk about it, deal with it.

       Song of the Moment ::  This Is Your Life by Switchfoot   Driving Days until Test ::  just one...  &nbsp;  Sometimes I wonder why people spend so much time complaining about their lives. How bad can it really be? I'll be the first to point out that I bitch about my life on a regular basis, but in many ways I feel like I'm justified in doing so.&nbsp;  My mom has cancer. &nbsp; If that doesn't put a damper on happy hour, I don't know what would. On top of that, I'm still battling depression. So I have somewhat of a right to be upset about my state of affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; What annoys me is people who write "oh, damn, I lost my address book, my life sux, now I can't throw a giant party-for-no-reason with my parents money, what will I doooo?" Jeez. I just want to slap people like that. If you think losing your address book sucks, try losing your family (emotionally; they're still here physically) due to your mother's cancer. Now  that  qualifies as a "bite me, I hate life, things will never improve" situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; In other news, I  did  just whip out three - no, four -  urlLink poems  in the last hour. &nbsp;&nbsp; Now iff you'll excuse me, I'm going to go be alone with my thoughts.

       Song of the Moment ::  Bloody Valentine by Good Charlotte   Driving Days until Test ::  one! eek!   so, it's nearly 5am and I haven't slept at all. I meant to go to bed early, really, but I got distracted by my new poetry blog ( urlLink click here  or I'll bust your balls). I was making the template for it and it took forever and now it's five in the friggin morning and I still haven't gone to bed. Surprisingly enough, I'm still coherrent enough to think in complete sentences and as far as I know I'm spelling everything right haha.  &nbsp;  I parallel parked today. It was sooooo much easier than I thought it would be. I only had to do it twice before Coach H let me stop. So now  on Saturday   tomorrow  I do highway driving, and then my test is July 20th (Monday). Yikes. I'm pretty confident about it though because I'm doing a lot better now. So yeah...  &nbsp;  Chels found a gecko in the house earlier; it's the first one we've ever had in here. It was only about an inch long and so very cute. We trapped it and took it outside, but not until we named it something (the Japanese word for one, because it was 1:30 in the morning when we found him; I'm too far gone to remember it right now haha). It felt good to release him outside because he probably would've died in the house considering there aren't any bugs for him to eat indoors.  &nbsp;  I'm going to bed now.

       Song of the Moment ::  Nobody's Listening by Linkin Park  Driving Days until Test ::  two.  I need to get out of this damn house. I just got in a huge screaming match with Mom and Chelsea, which wouldn't be terribly bad except that this is the second or third in as many days. We never used to fight like this. We would fight, but none of us would ever get as angry as we've been getting. I just cussed them both out; I called Chelsea a bitch and - this is the worst part and I hate myself for it - I told Mom that sometimes I wish she would just die. I don't, really, but my saying that made me realize that I do need to just be away from all of this shit. The entire family is so on edge, so stressed, that our tempers are on short fuses. I just...I need to move out for a little while. Not sure where I could go, though. I might ask Val, but to be honest I'm not entirely sure her parents would go for that. My parents wouldn't either, I don't think, but at this point I don't give a fuck. How the hell am I supposed to deal with all of this when I'm right in the middle of it? This is by far the hardest time in my life, and instead of it making me stronger it's destroying me. I feel like somebody cut me up and tossed my pieces all over town, and now some unknown force is trying to put me back together but I'm too spread out, and too finely chopped, so they can't find all of me and I'm destined to stay torn up forever. I can't help but wonder if maybe -  maybe  - just not living here for a while would help any. I can't help it; I love my family but right now I need to distance myself from them. At the same time, though, I'm torn because if my family ever needed to stay together, it's right fucking now. I don't think Mom would take it well at all, which is something she really doesn't need (the stress). I dunno. I'm always close to that breaking point, because I have depression and I've just never been entirely happy, but now I'm only like one step away from that point. I don't think I've ever been this close to a breakdown without actually breaking down.  See, I've had all of two mental breakdowns in my life and let me tell you - they suck ass. Number one was several years ago, when I was ten or eleven. I don't remember any of the details, but I spent nearly 24 solid hours just crying. The second and last one was last summer (almost a year to the day ago). I had been depressed for six months by that point, and I would lay in bed at night and just cry and think, this isn't right. I shouldn't be feeling like this. Then one day something inside me just exploded and I ended up physically hurting Chels. It turned into this huge mess and I was put into counsling and all this stuff. All that is beside the point, though. The point is, after that instant in which I threw the sharp object at a certain sister's...head...I spent days just crying and hating myself and just wanting to die. I thought about suicide contantly, and I was just emotionally a wreck. Looking back, I don't even think I was all here, mentally, during that time. I do not want that to happen again. Life just ends, which admittidly wouldn't be that different from life happening, but it still bites. I'm afraid that if one more thing happens, which is pretty much inevitable, I'm going to take that last step into mental nothingness. The logical, humane part of me is terrified of doing so and wants to do everything possible to avoid it. The cynical, depressed side of me, however,  wants  to take that last step. To just...lose myself in my own hate and self-terror. That's the best way to describe my mental breakdowns: I'm full of self-hate, I'm scared to death of what I might do to myself (I've plotted my own suicide many times; I decided that I would overdose on my antidepressants simply because it's quick and - most importantly - ironic), and overall I don't see how anything can go on.   The thing that scares me the most is that I'm already feeling myself start to think this way. More and more lately, I've started wondering what things would be like if I wasn't around. Not dead, necessarily, just not here. I've been thinking about suicide and death more, and I've started cussing for no fucking reason (see?). This  isn't  me. At least, it never used to be. Many days the only reason I get out of bed at all is because I have to take care of Zeus (the number one reason I have for not being able to move out - I wouldn't be able to take him and missing him would kill me b/c I adore him) and because not getting up would piss Mom off, which would start a fight, and I just plain don't have enough in me to even argue. I don't feel like I even have enough energy to  not  fight, if that makes sense.   Depression is such a fucking bitch. So is cancer.   ...So am I.

       Song of the Moment ::  Maroon 5's Tangled  Driving Days until Test ::  two (yikes...)  Yes, a  green  paw. I sat straight up in bed and pinned Zues down so I could look at his  green  front paw. It looked like he stepped in somebody's green hair dye. Then I noticed that the tip of his ear and the fur around his mouth was also green. Hmm...I flipped over and hung off the edge of the bed so I could look under it. Aha! Mystery solved - there was [what was left of] a pen under the bed, his favorite spot to chew up stuff he isn't supposed to have. Apparently, sometime during the night, he found my pen and decided to eat it. He chewed up the end, causing ink to spill all over his paw, as well as rub off onto his jaw where he was chewing on it. Still not sure how he managed to get it on his ear, though.   Speaking of Zeus, Chels and I were playing with the dogs earlier and we trapped Zeus on the chair by building a fort around him, but he managed to get out (his middle name is Houdini for a reason). Then we built a huge tower out of the couch cushions (the sofa bed is out right now), the cushion from the chair, and three bed pillows, on  top  of the bed, and then put Zeus's Legless frog (it really is a stuffed frog w/o legs; the dogs pulled them all out) on top of the whole thing. Eventually he tried climbing to the top but in the end he just succeeded in knocking the entire thing over on himself. It was funny as hell; I laughed for almost twenty minutes because the whole time he was attempting to get it, Scarlet was lunging at the tower trying to make it fall so  she  could have Legless. It was great.

       Song of the Moment ::  Fighter, Christina Aguliera   This is day :: 5,872 :: of my life.    I passed my driving test, go me. I aced parallel parking and backing. The only thing I had problems with was that I kept speeding. Don't ask me why; I never do that. Luckily I had coach Hardin, whom I've driven with before, so he knew that I don't usually do that. He made me go to his son's house lol and sit in the driveway while he talked to him. Val passed, too, yay!  &nbsp;  It looks like the cuts I made on my leg are going to scar at least a little. I hope so, anyways.  &nbsp;  Zeus escaped from his locked crate today. I'm not really surprised; I'm mostly curious as to how he managed it. Ever since he was a puppy he's always been the little escape artist. His middle name (yes, our dogs have middle names, shut up) is Houdini for a reason. He didn't chew anything up while he was out, thank goodness. He's been so bad about chewing on stuff other than his zillions of toys that I was seriously thinking of selling him there for&nbsp;a while.  &nbsp;  We're&nbsp;leaving to go&nbsp;camping Thursday night. It will be nice to be able to relax, although in reality I doubt I'll get any good relaxation time in because it will Zeus' first time to camp. It ought to be an interesting weekend...

She asked me some questions about what it's like to be depressed ( urlLink click here  - this is a poem I wrote that I feel sums it up best), which I really appreciated because nobody ever actually wants to know what I'm going through. They all say "I know how you feel," but unless they've been depressed how can they? So at least Brooke made the effort to understand at least somewhat how I'm feeling at my lowest points.

       Song of the Moment ::  Numb, Linkin Park   Driving Days until Test ::  none  &nbsp;  Welcome to my mental breakdown.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I just did something that I never would have done a year, even a month ago. It's something I've thought about constantly for I guess two weeks now, but knew better than to do.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I...cut myself. It's more of scratches, really, that didn't even bleed, but the point is I did it on purpose and it scarys the shit out of me. What if I keep doing it? The pain isn't that bad, really...and the redness is so satisfying. It's kind of a criss-cross pattern with a couple of deeper cuts - still surface cuts - so it isn't that bad. Except that it IS that bad, it's an awful thing and nobody can ever know that I did this. But what if I keep doing it and eventually I go deeper, and end up being brave enough to carve words and designs and such out of my own skin? That's the only thing holding me back right now is that I'm too scared to do that. I would cut - scratch - more but I dropped the scissors and I'm crying too hard right now to reach down and get them; I can barely even see the screen.  &nbsp; To make matters worse, I'm afraid that I'm&nbsp;close to having an eating disorder. I&nbsp;rarely have an&nbsp;appetite these days, so I&nbsp;don't each much. As a result, I'm losing weight and I'm getting sick. &nbsp; The very, absolute worst part, however,&nbsp;is that there isn't a person on this planet - except you, if you're reading this - who knows that I'm even at the point where self-mutilation becomes reality and an eating disorder is hiding out around the corner.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I feel so empty, so worthless...I'm afraid for my life.  &nbsp;  There's nothing left now.     RIGHT NOW     mood ::  please don't ask.   listening to/watching ::  A.F.I., Sing the Sorrow   eating/drinking ::  nothing   craving ::  ...   talking to ::  nobody.   thinking about ::  blood...   wishing ::  nothing.   wearing ::  pants and a tshirt   random ::  Good-bye.

       Song of the Moment ::  Bring the Night On - Eve 6  This is day :: 5,881 :: of my life.    Current Mood Weather ::  partly cloudy  Blogger is moving uber slow right now and quite frankly it's pissing me off because I want to write!  I have had inspiration just spilling out of me the past week and a ½ or so. As a result, I've had poems out the yin yang. In fact, today I set a new personal record of five good poems in two hours. I've even been able to write on a fairly regular basis of every other day/every three days or so. For me, this is incredible. If you were to look back on my older poetry, you would see that I would have a poem every month, two months, sometimes even up to six months. However if you look over the past two weeks, I've written one every three days or so. I'm very proud of this because I've always had the horrible pattern of writing a poem, going through a LONG dry spell, writing one or two poems, going through another dry spell, and so on. It seems like for now, I've moved past that.   An update on my bipolar situation. Mom is going to find me a psyciatrist so we can at least figure out what's going on. I don't think I am bipolar, I just have a lot of symptoms for it that I didn't have before.  Before what? I honestly don't know. Mom's cancer, maybe. When your life is monotone - depression, short spurts of happiness, depression, depression - time tends to blur. I can't pinpoint the exact day or even month I started having these symptoms. I can, however, tell you that I probably had them long before I ever noticed them. The thing that confuses me is that even though it seems like it's blatantly obvious that I've developed these symptoms and habits, nobody else has noticed. If they have, they haven't said anything.  Why are people uncomfortable talking about mental illness? Even people who don't have a mental illness have problems discussing it. I'm mentally ill in that I'm clinically depressed and possibly bordering on bipolar, but I have no problem sharing. M&M told me the other day how brave I am for sharing my deepest thoughts with the world. I had never considered it before, that some people can't talk about certain things around other people, but the more I think about it the more I notice it. When I happen to mention in passing my depression, people will either A] bullshit about how they understand what I'm going through (a huge pet peeve of mine and most other clinically depressed people, but that's another post), B] change the subject entirely, or C] just plain stop talking. What's the big deal? This is something I live with  every   single   fucking   day . It's everyday life for me and millions of others. People get physically sick and nobody has a problem with it. However, somebody can be mentally unhealthy and suddenly we've stumbled on a taboo topic.   Why is this? Is it because the general public is uninformed and knows nothing about mental health? That seems to be the case with a lot of people I've talked to about my depression. Brookadee, bless her, took the time to ask me what I go through and learn about depression in general. She admitted that she knew nothing about it and had always wondered, but was afraid to ask. I told her that if the rest of the mentally ill (I have officially over-used that phrase) were at all like me, they will appreciate being asked. It's refreshing. It's a breath of fresh air, to use a tired cliche. Instead of avoiding the topic, she faced it head on and I, for one, was very greatful to have a chance to talk about it in-depth and to educate somebody about the real deal.  I just realized that what started out as a short post on the random things in my life, this has turned into a polite rant about mankind's insensitivity and stupidity. But I feel good now, having gotten that off my chest, so perhaps I can go to bed. No, wait. LiveUpdate just popped up and now I have to run it. I guess I'll entertain myself and y'all with a story of Zeus's first shower.  Zeus was starting to smell really bad, as dogs often do. I usually pay my sister to bathe him, but at this point she is covered in over eighty bug bites (it isn't as bad as it sounds, really) and didn't want to risk him scratching her up. So I decided that since I had to get clean as well, Zeus might as well take a shower with me. He was actually pretty well-behaved, even when I was shampooing him and holding him under the shower to rinse him off. The only difficulty was that as soon as I set him on the bottom of the tub so I could wash my hair, he would jump out, one time nearly taking the shower curtain with him. Overall, though, it worked well and was pretty fun to boot. He's only twenty-three pounds, so it wasn't that big of a deal to hold him. It was slightly awkward trying to make sure I had him all shampooed, but I really had fun watching him look like a drowned rat. =] From now on, Zeus gets all his bathes in shower form with moi. Too bad Scarlet is too big to take a shower, eh?   LiveUpdate is gone, so I'm off to bed. Goodnight. Er, morning?    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  fidgety, as I often am these days  listening to/watching ::  Eve 6  eating/drinking ::  nothing  craving ::  foood...  talking to ::  nobody...only insane people like myself are up at this hour.  thinking about ::  i should be in bed  wishing ::  it would rain me to sleep  wearing ::  pink love-a-lot carebear pj pants and a white tshirt  random ::  I have two Coke cans, three Red Fusion cans, and two Vanilla Coke cans on my desk, plus an empty can of Pringles and a stale bag of Misson tortilla chips.

       Song of the Moment ::  The Leaving Song Part II by A.F.I.   This is day :: 5,879 :: of my life.    My depression is NOT getting better; if anything it's getting worse. My Zoloft helps a lot, but when I don't take it things go right back to how they were a year, two years ago. I don't know if&nbsp;anyone has&nbsp;noticed this or not, although it seems like it would be hard to miss. I guess I've managed to hide it pretty well from the outside world, but I haven't bothered even trying to hide it from my family.   The reason I'm writing this is because for the last two months, I've slept for about four hours every night and overall I've been fine. I also noticed that I would be in a great mood for a while, then suddenly be extremely depressed for no real reason. I started wondering if this was all related to my depression, so I decided to research it. What I found scares me, but it also explains a lot.   My symptoms aren't neccessarily related to depression. They are, however, related to manic-depression, also known as bipolar disorder. I can relate to so much of what I've read about it, to so many of the symptoms; some of which aren't symptoms of normal depression (normal depression...talk about your oxymoron). I don't think I have manic-depression, per say, but I think that if I'm not careful it could get to that point pretty easily.   To be honest, I don't know WHAT to think. I do feel like I have extreme highs and lows, but at the same time it's been so long since I didn't that maybe it's normal. That probably only makes sense to me, but basically I just don't know what life without depression is like. I spend a lot of time thinking about how I would be if I weren't on Zoloft. The idea scares me because even missing one day can make me depressed. The worst part is that all of this is normal for me now. I don't even remember what it's like to be happy without the help of a pill.   I'm so fucked up. And the most ironic thing? Very, very few people even know that I am.    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  confused, thoughtful, scared, subdued, and oh yeah - scared.   listening to/watching ::  nothing. i want total silence right now.   eating/drinking ::  pringles   craving ::  happiness   talking to ::  nobody, its 2:30 in the fucking morning and i should really be in bed.   thinking about ::  depression...bipolar disorder...life in general   wishing ::  I want to know if my happiness is real, or if it's a faux happiness brought on by my "happy pills".   wearing ::  jeans and an old red t-shirt from an elementary school i never went to   random ::  I think and write&nbsp;about death a lot.

I'm sitting at my desk right now in sweatpants and my bikini, pretending I live in California where it is normal to do so. There's no real reason for me to do this except that it was only 80 today, and I am rebelling against the unusally cool Texas summer.  Camping was very relaxing. The dogs behaved, the weather was nice, and the lake was beautiful. The swim beach at the state park we were at is down a long flight of steps that winds through the woods and ends up in a cove with cliffs towering above it on either side. The water was incredibly clear for lake water and the bottom of the lake actually was pretty weed-free.   The only bad part about my mini-vacation is the fact that I have about fifteen mysterious bug bites from my knees to my waist. Hell, my  bug bites  have bug bites. All this itching is about to drive me insane because if one bite isn't itching, four others are. No, really.

How frustrating it was to walk all over school just to get a piece of paper, a temporary ID, and six heavy-ass books? Very. At least my very good friend Mariah was there to hang out with me.  Speaking of the crazy Pariah Mayne (Mariah's nickname; long story), I'm going to be taking care of her 7-week-old Australian Shepherd for a week starting on Saturday. It's sure to produce many silly stories, as we already have a nine-month old puppy and a [very playful]  five-year-old Golden. Oh, dogs, how I love thee.

Today's mood weather ::  sunny  Have you ever noticed those crosses and wreaths by the side of the highway or road? You know the ones I mean - the ones that people put up in memory of somebody who died there. Sure, you've seen them. But have you ever really  thought  about them?  You drive by those crosses on a regular basis, never stopping to think that for a split second, you are in the last place one person ever saw. For a split second, you're in the exact same place that somebody was when they died. But nine times out of ten, you don't realize that. You're too caught up in your music, or your conversation, or planning how you're going to meet that big deadline coming up. So next time you see a memorial cross, take the time to think that somebody really died in that spot, the very one you just flew past - alive.

Today's mood weather ::  sunny  I was going to start off by apologizing for any incoherent thoughts, considering I didn't go to bed until 5 because of...things. However -  Windy just walked over to me and started barking at me. I'm not sure why; I thought at first that she wanted to play, but now she's curled up on the bed with one of Zeus's rawhide bones. Oh, well. I bet I'm not the only one in the house awake any more. She actually spent all night in her playpen. She woke up at about 4:15 this morning (I was, as I mentioned, still awake) and had to go potty. Well, she wouldn't go outside, nooo. Instead, she comes inside and immediatly pees on my carpet. Grr to her too.Whoops, there's one of those incoherent thoughts I was talking about...  Anyway, I'm going to go see if I can't find something to keep her distracted; something that isn't my door. I'll try to post a more meaningful post later, but I'm not sure I'll even be awake, heh.   edit ::  I have a secret...and no, I'll never tell. Ha!    RIGHT NOW    mood ::  sleepy  listening to/watching ::  nothing  eating/drinking ::  chewing gum, yes this early  craving ::  uhhh....hehe  talking to ::  nobody  thinking about ::  last night  wishing ::  nothing really  wearing ::  jeans and a t-shirt  random ::  Windy was looking at herslef in the mirror. I don't think she knew it was her.

       Song of the Moment ::  Miss Independent, Kelly Clarkson  This is day :: 5,897 :: of my life.   Today's mood weather ::  sunny  A friend and I were talking last night about our muses and how there seems to be a shortage of them...let me copy what he wrote in his own journal about it.  "...we came to the conclusion that we all have a muse assigned to us. The difficulties arrive when we realize that there are only nine muses, and 6 billion people on the planet. This is obviously a problem, for even a legendary character has boundries. So, we decided that if we gave our Muse an impressive and complimentary name, she might be more willing to help us specifically."  He named his muse Melete, which means meditation. I did some research and decided on the name Isaura. It's a greek name meaning "soft air." This may not make much sense to those of you who aren't writers, but when I think of something like air being described as soft, I'm somehow comforted. The connection here is that my writing has always been a huge comfort to me. Hence, Isaura. Plus, I find it fitting that its a Greek name, as the muses were originally from ancient Greece. Hopefully now that she has an "impressive and complimentary" name, she'll be more loyal to me and will come when I need to be comforted.  In other news: I'm being published! A group I'm part of is publishing an anthology of work relating to pain/coping and one of my poems is going in it. The book will be published through lulu.com, a self-publishing website, and will only be available online for the time being. Isn't this great?! I'm so incredibly excited about it.    RIGHT NOW    mood ::  inspired (perhaps naming Isaura was just what I needed)  listening to/watching ::  Superfly by Thousand Foot Krutch  eating/drinking ::  Dr. Pepper  craving ::  nothing!  talking to ::  nobody  thinking about ::  I need to go read Huck Finn.  wishing ::  nothing really.  wearing ::  jeans and a red sweatshirt (it's been uncommonly cool here for August)  random ::  I'm being published! Eee!
