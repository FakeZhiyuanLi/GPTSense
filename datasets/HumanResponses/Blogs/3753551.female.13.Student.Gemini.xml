        this is the 5th post ive done today... I have no life...   well, i actually didnt go out at all today because i feel like a marijuana plant. (im green, duh.)    I will hopefully leave my pit which now smells like a rubbish bin since ive cleaned out my bag... i hope my parents wont enter it. The smell reminds we of the time I dragged home a huge roll of flat foam with little foam spikes on it. It made my room smell like crap... like my brothers room used to. It was inconvenient since I had actually cut my hand open the day before and had to spend all day there. I almost suffocated. But anyway, back to the part about me being lifeless...  My parents are going to drag me to the movies again... tonight *oh god* and im going to see shrek 2... i would be okay with this, since most of the time, if you see a movies which you enjoy, you seek to find more pleasurable veiwing in the sequel of the movie, except for the fact it is a cold night and when its a cold night, my parents leave the house wearing puffy wooly jumpers which smell like dishwashing liquid and lavender (not a nice combination since the dishwashing liquid is lime scented) I know I shouldnt critisise for I often wear a huge shit-green coloured jumper that ive stolen from my father's draw, but not ever to the movies. I find you get judged and judge more at the movies and this will make me self-conscious. So i dont wear hobo jumpers to the pictures. But if you are seen with company such as your parents wearing jumpers, its embarrasing for you, even if the people around you dont give a shit about what they're wearing, you feel like they do (thats what self-consciousness is to me) and thats what worries you. If these random normal people who you've never met and will never meet in your life dont like what your parents are wearing..........  You've never seen my parent's jumpers...

            OKay now Im sorry for doing this but I'm seriously in a mood for moosic. Funeral for a Friend is my favourite band of all time and I seriously feel like saying that IM IN LOVE WITH FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND. I woke up this morning and played the entire album 'casually dressed and deep in conversation' (buy it if you think you have taste) and then I posed infront of my mirror, as you do, playing my guitar (I found this quite difficult so I did it with an imaginary guitar instead. I found myself looking fairly hip and groovy.) And then after that i went into the lounge, bunged on the fire and started playing a song that my friend made up and taught to me yesterday night on the phone. The song is now probably the coolest thing I can play on my guitar. Im learning Bullet Theory on the geetar now too but its bloody hard. But until i learn that, that song will be coolest.  Heres a picture of them at the Kerrang! Awards 2003... they won best new band... it was well deserved.     Heres a pic of them all looking amazingly hot. Matt Davies has caused me dehydration through loss of saliva due to drooling.

      hey yall. We have selectives and ive chosen Multimedia and German. Im hoping to be a graphic designer when i grow up. That is, of course, after my fame of being a fmous rock-star fizzles out. So... when im about 99... and not for my retirement... for fun... yeah... for money for cookies... yahuh well anyway. Im 13 and want to learn some stuff about it before i start the class in year 9 im sure tons of uz out there are good at pic making and photo editing and shit. look down on me..... please...

      hey everybody. This is my new blog. I'm Imogen Galilee yup yup.  Anyway... what happened today.. nothin much im not going out today cos i feel sick. AGAIN. I didnt go out last week much either. also cos i was feeling sick. On the 25th of May, ONE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY (my b-days on the 24th) I put my hand through a glass door. I wont say why cos my reasons pretty pathetic and nobody but my parents belives me. I was rushed to hospital but my mum who came back about HALF AN HOUR AFTER IT HAPPENED WHEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THAT SHE SAID SHED BE BACK IN FIVE MINS. she lied, i cried. Well, actually, as a matter of fact i didnt cry because i think i mightve been in shock or something. I got cut at the bottom of my fingers, you know, where they reach the palm and a mm higher or something. All the flesh was cut open and shit and you could see my bone in my middle finger and OH MY GOD. When they first took the dirty dryed-tea encrusted kitchentowel off my wound, my mum made me look away. But when I went to the bathroom, I had a look myself.   The doc said id cut through about 40 per cent of my nerve tenden and but luckily it would be fixed soon. Pwew. well its been about 6 weeks since that happened and im fine now. It was cool but cos i didnt have to write for 6 weeks so i just sat in class and dozed off. But I COULD play my guitar. woop woop. what a bludge of a term it was! the whole of 2nd term! bliss!

       Have you&nbsp;ever felt like nobody understands what your about or where your coming from... why you say the stuff you say or do the things you do, why you get angry or upset or why you want to kill somebody for an apparent reason which is about as serious sounding as a stick of celery with a bow tie and lipstick? I have. I feel like that right now.  Right fucking now!!!  So yeah. Thats how im feeling. I also feel like Im never going to fucking meet anyone whos going to understand me. Thats making me feel like absoloute CRAP.   White white white   Black Black Black    R  a  i  n  b  o  w   C  o  l  ou  r&nbsp;&nbsp; ...................................

        This would be a new post for a new day if it was a new day but its 9 pm so i guess its not.  Im proud of myself. This hols i have gone out of my dreary house every day except tuesday. Usually when its the hols, i just sleep and eat and grow arse and then i get depressed cos im so FAT. but not now! Im going to a coffee festival tomoro... although if i dont invite someone fast, im going to be going by myself. either that or ill ask mum to come with me. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . but i think ill probably get someone to come...  Our lil band thing is now a current issue... nothing has really been done about it. We have a bassist, kate, and a guitarist, me, and another guitarist, jess, and supposibly another guitarist, elena, but i havent spoken to her for a good while and god knows what the fuck is happening with her. If she decides not to decide, we have back ups... just random, random, random people who we just happen to know who just happen to play the guitar...justin, rob, some dude which ive never met (by the way im starting to say dude which is, in my books, NOT GOOD) and also this dude in yr 7 who apparently has hair like matt bellamy was meant to be a drummer, apparently kate knew him or somthin. i dont know. but annnnyway.   If you know me and are in the sydney area, contact me so i can stalk you.   there is NOTHING TO FLIPPIN DO ON THE COMP ANYMORE!!!!!! nobody is ever online! i think its cos they have lives or something i dont kno. lives are overrated if you ask me.  but like you would.  What is life? A journey to death with arcade games on the way? pff that was stupid wasnt it. and i thought i was poetic. i guess not. LEts make up a poem right here right now.   There once was a man called Greg  Who liked rice pudding with nutmeg.  He sat on his ass, alone in the grass  Eating and getting a cramp in his leg.   how was it?  hows this?   Jess. jess.  has lots of zest.  accepts nothing less  than the absolute best.   how was it?  hows this?   Kates gonna kick me off the comp now  Because she is such a mean old cow.  No im only joking.  Ive started smoking  She just hit me....ow   she didnt actually it was just the only thing that rhymed. and shes not a cow eitha. ok? ok

        finally its the hols. the term went by so quickly. i still thought we'd just started up til about week 7. Maybe its cos nothing's happened.   I think im going to go buy a cd today. armor for sleep, dream to make belive.   but anyway, i want to start my random thoughts-on-black-and-pink. *they make me feel better*   we saw spiderman 2 yesterday. it was great. better than the first one.  i think im going to see shrek 2 again or spiderman 2 again tomoro. all my friends have turned into boring bitchy little shits. why, lord? why? but thats okay. they're still my friends, but i think we've all drifted apart over the term and now we're all independent, lonely souls.   *note to self: its hip to be square.*          ARMOR FOR SLEEP ^^ *yay*
