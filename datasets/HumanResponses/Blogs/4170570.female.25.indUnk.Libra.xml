       I'm down.. with running nose, cough, sore throat and fever.. started yesterday.. yesterday was tough.. 1 colleague declared MC early in the morning, and my symptoms started at noon.. can't afford to leave work to see doc, cos we were already short of manpower.. sigh.. had to hang on till knock off time.. took pills and felt better later in the evening.. but by midnight, the fever returned.. this morning was feeling much better, so decided to pop 2 pills and join my friends for a blading session.. the blade was fulfilling.. for the 1st time, i finally fell flat onto the ground.. haha.. didn really fall during the previous rounds.. but bladed with the trouble of occasionally having to take tissue papers out to blow my nose.. after the blade, i went home and washed my car.. felt that my sunday is properly spent.. but my health took a turn again, after the wash.. and now, my larynx has succumbed to the virus.. hoarse voice, and extra efforts are needed to speak... feeling feverish again, and nose is blocked.. sianz.. well at least, the sickness returned at the correct time.. after i've fulfilled my tasks..

       1st time in my life, i washed and waxed my car all by myself.. Took me more than 3hrs to finish everything.. Its incredibly tiring.. it seems to consume more energy than my usual workouts in the gym.. i wonder how many more times can i sustain b4 giving up and allow the professionals to do it.. haha.. but looking at my car now, the efforts sure paid off.. looking at the shine on it, makes me feel fulfilled.. but my arms feel strengthless now.. guess it wa a good work out, comparable to those i do in the gym.. just that it doesn't work on my legs..

       i did something today which i wouldn't have done normally.. i always have a problem waking up earlier than my usual waking hrs.. thus i always hate to attend meetings or seminars as they always disrupt my usual sleeping pattern.. having to wake up earlier will make me feel lethargic for the rest of the day, sometimes even cause headaches.. but today, i woke up an hr earlier.. willingly.. haha, why? i guess the power of my new toy is just too overwhelming.. for the sake of this new toy, i woke up early.. hmm.. i wonder how long can i make sacrifices for this toy.. as long as possible, i hope..

       Its been abt 4mths since the day we broke up.. after our break-up,he used to appear in my dreams almost every night, esp if i thought of him before sleep.. and watever the dreams abt him were, they definitely made the day that followed, intolerable and difficult to pass.. but for the past 2mths, i didn really dream of him, and i was glad.. my life is gradually regaining to normal and i'm slowly getting used to being single after 8yrs of relationship with him.. but last night, he appeared in my dreams again.. sigh.. why.. why must he appear.. just as i thought my life is getting better without him, just as i thought i have forgotten abt him, he appeared in my dreams, and it ruined everything.. wat does this symbolise.. am i still thinking of him subconsiously? no no.. i HAVE to move on.. ARGH!!

       Was driving home from work last night and as usual, tuned to my favourite radio station. A song by JJ Lim was played. Though I've heard that song before, i never took note of it. It was only yesterday, alone in the car, without any disturbance, that i listened to the lyrics. WOW! It was SO moving! My vision blurred when tears began to fill my eyes. The lyrics were short, simply written, yet touching.

       Work hasn't been very smooth lately and i'm trying hard to improve the situation. Well, at least today had been a rather fulfilling day. Early in the afternoon, a couple came into our store. They recognised me, as i attended to them abt half yr ago. As for me, needing to meet different people everyday, i couldn't recall attending to them until i took the lady's record out, proving to me that i did attend to her last time. She commented, "I'm so happy to see that you are here, because we like your service". Then her partner asked me to help him adjust an item he bought from elsewhere some time ago, i just did as per normal. When he tried it on, he was saying, "Wow! It definitely feels much more comfortable! You are indeed very good at it!" ( nah, i dun think i'm good yet.. in fact, i'm still learning.. ) It really feels great to hear such nice comments from customers ( as such comments rarely come out from the mouth of locals ) and indeed a much needed morale booster.

       Heard from my good friend yesterday, that he failed his driving test. Everything was smooth until somebody knocked his car while he was stationary, awaiting to turn. And he was faulted for that. I think it is really unfair to be penalised for a mistake that made by others while there was absolutely nothing the person could do to prevent it from happenning. He was just too suay to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. I could feel that he was extremely upset and dejected over the incident. Somehow, when i heard the news, it sort of affected me. Upon hearing the it, i felt very sad and sorry for him. Couldn't stop thinking how was he coping with the disappointment. I used to be nonchalant when things happen to my friends. But somehow or rather, i've been more emotional lately. Perhaps there is some changes in me after my breakup with my ex bf? Perhaps i'm beginning to realise the importance of friendship. Whatever it is, i hope my friend is feeling better now.
