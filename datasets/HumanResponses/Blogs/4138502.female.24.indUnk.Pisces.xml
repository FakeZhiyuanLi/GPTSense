      Once again I've got up today and had another huge kick up the arse reminder of how things were last year and the contrast is the thing that is most upsetting I suppose.  I got woken up early by BOO who for some reason couldn't settle and kept tipping his water over on purpose.  By the time I had got up for the 3rd time to restabilise the lamp on the table and to mop up the water I was wide awake and there seemed little point in getting back into bed just to sit there waiting for him to do it all again.  So I got up and thought I wouldn't log onto the internet right away as Saul was still asleep and it would make a noise so I sat at the computer and played ZOO TYCOON for an hour or so.  I know that sounds childish but its a distraction technique that I use when there might be something simmering in my mind which I need to try not to unveil.  Eventually Saul started to stir and I thought I'd come online to check my e-mail.  Things are very quiet in all of my groups.  There were a few forwards and not much else so I checked my other account.  You see I have a hotmail address for my group mails and a hotmail address for my personal e-mails.  When I checked in my personal account there was a name from the past sat in there staring at me.  My old tutor from uni (where I was last year) was writing to ask whether I would be rejoining the course or not.  If not he would have to withdraw me.  (For anyone reading this who is not familiar with the situation - The reason I can't do the course anymore is because the uni is way way away from where I live, and the only way I could manage to do the part time course there was to stay with my parents for 3 days of the week.  However last January we had a big arguement and they said they didn't want to see me again.)  Since back then of course not only have things not been great with mum or dad (not great being an understatement) but my money situation has changed.  I know no-one believes me anymore.  They think I'm fine and that whatever was wrong with me is gone.  However I'm sat here feeling awful again today and I'm wondering whether it isn't time to maybe attempt a trip to the doctors.  My back has been permenantly bad since before last Christmas and now my stomach muscles hurt too (could be to do with the bug I've just got rid of mind you).  On top of that ME doesn't just go away.  I deal with it better now but none of you seem to understand.  Yes I do go out and yes from the outside maybe I do look better.  But I sleep until 11 most mornings and get up feeling shit.  I take paracetamol out with me wherever we go just incase I get bad pains, and I am not by any means as well as everyone thinks.  That said, I am still relying on my incapacity benefit and since moving in with Saul officially (eg changing all of the details over to London) I am now expected to be paid for by him and so I only get £30 a week.  This is yet another reason why I can't  do the course anymore.  It used to cost me £25 a week just for the trainfare to get there.  Anyway all those details aside, I'm sat here feeling quite pissed off right now.  I loved that course and I know there is no way I can do it now, which to me is yet another slap in the face.  You see Ben, when I was at school I struggled so hard to fit in.  When everyone else said they were going to 6th form and that only losers went to college, I wanted to fit in so I worked my arse off to get into 6th form.  I hated every minute of it.  I hated being treated like a child and expected to not leave the grounds just as you are not supposed to when you are 12.  Thing is I wasn't 12 I was 16 and it annoyed me.   Every minute of 6th form was agony, and I think it was then that I started to get ill because I used to feel sick in Sociology lessons where we had to sit in the lecture theatre.  Because I felt sick in there, I'd not eat because I thought if I didn't eat I wouldn't feel sick.  Of course that doesn't work.  On top of that then I used to feel sick and feel dizzy and my concentration used to wander.  Gradually it spread to more lessons and I felt ill most of the time.  I dropped a few lessons to see if the lightened work load would help but it didn't.  I should never have gone to 6th form just to be like everyone else.  I should have looked more at what I wanted to do.  Anyway Ben, by the time I was a few terms into 6th form I was feeling awful and so it wasn't long before I said to mum and dad I might drop out and go to college instead.  They thought that was a good idea because I could do what I wanted (subject wise) in college and at 6th form you couldn't do English and Geography because it was in the same subject pool and you could only do one subject from each pool.  So I started college and it was wonderful.  I'm not saying its the same for everyone - I'm sure most loved 6th form.  But I felt like a bird released and I loved college.  I'd go in with Dad every morning and I was there early before even the tutors turned up.  I had lots of friends and it was great fun too.  That was the first time in my whole life I felt like I'd fitted in and was happy.  Then a couple of terms in, with no warning I got some virus.  I felt really ill and so I stayed home for a week.  2 weeks later it hadn't gone and I felt just as bad so I started having trips back and forth to the doctor and they had the audacity to tell me that it was probably all in my head and that it was because of the stress of college.  I wasn't stressed at college.  I loved it.  It got worse and worse and my vision got worse and I couldn't walk and .........well you'll remember bits of the rest.  Anyway I had to drop out of college then because of my health and I started doing A-levels from home in English Language and Literature just so that I wasnt seen as being lazy.  I've always cared what people thought of me.  I took those early and passed.  You see people can say that I'm living in cloud cuckoo land or that I'm thick or lazy but I worked my arse off for that course and I took the exams early.  Not many can do that.   And so when I went back to college for the garden design course, it was like a dream come true.  I was back where I had been years ago and it was my chance to get it all back.  Only this time around I thought I had more.  Because I was a bit more adult, I had a boyfriend and a car and everything slotted into place wonderfully.  The work was great fun, and I enjoyed every lesson.  I even used to sit at lunch and chat to the tutors about our work etc because it was something I was passionate about.  So when things kicked off in January with mum and dad and I had to leave again it ripped me apart.  It was like a massive bowt of de javu and it was like being dragged through all the bad parts of my life again.  So this morning when I sat here and opened up that e-mail it was like reliving it all.  And it reminded me of what I'd lost.  Not only did he ask me how things were with you and mum and dad, (so I had to go into detail about how I'd not seen you in 8 months and how I'd sent letters but heard nothing back) but he wanted to know whether I'd be going back to restart the course this year.  If not he had to take my name off the list.  And thats so final you see.  Because the course won't run again - its turning into some watered down gardening course instead of a design one and so writing that e-mail saying that nothing had changed was like signing another wish off of my list - never to be granted.  I really hope when you are my age you're grabbing every opportunity thats put in front of you and you won't have the added burden of thinking that you are not good enough all of the time.  Because you see thats how I think.  What with dad saying I'm mad, and mum calling me names before now.........and being teased all of the way through school, and then dropping out of college 3 times.......I feel like a loser.  I feel useless.  Every time I look at course details at a college I read the details and think to myself "I couldn't do that."  Anyway thats it for now I think.........Vent done.

      Woke up far too early this morning with a little help from Boo who you've never met. He's coming up to 6 months old now so will need to have his bits done and his jabs organised soon. He's a black and white sort of long haired cat. Sort of meaning that he's not short haired but he also doesn't have long long hair at the moment. He's just fluffy. The week we got him was the week that Dora died. So it was tough for me to look at him for a while without getting upset. But he was so different to her that it wasn't long before I saw him as his own person.  We've never had male cats have we? I think even Tabitha was sadly passed away when you were born but we had always had female cats mainly I think because mummy said she didn't like the idea of a male cat spraying around the house. Well Boo is very different.  One of Saul's friends had a persian cat, who decided to leg it off one day (she was a house cat) and get pregnant. Boo is the result. He was the smallest of the litter and she kept him for ages and ages but he didn't get any bigger. I have my suspicions she wasn't feeding him very well because on the day that Saul brought him home in his little basket I expected him to be just like Buffy and Tessy, and Dora had been. He wasn't anything like that. I opened the front flap and he leapt out. He landed on the bed on his four tiny paws looking up at me and shouted. So I got out the tiny tins of kittens food we had and served him up a plate of it and sat it beside the bed and lowered him to it. He stuck is face in it and ate like there was no tomorrow.  And he's been growing ever since. I've just started taking him out into the garden which is about half the size of your garden but its okay. He plays with the dog next door and we have a large hammock which he sits in and sunbathes. He's been great company. I've not been very well. On and off I seem to be ill a lot of the time at the moment. First the flu, then the sickness bug, then another flu sickness hybrid mix.  Its really really hot here Ben. I know its not all that far away from where you are so I guess you're getting the same weather more or less. Though I speak to people that I went to school with who live near you and they say that you've had some thunder storms. Theres been no thunder in London. We need some but it persists in getting hotter and hotter without any letting up. Today it was 93. I went out and sat in the garden in a padded lounger chair to see if I could coax my legs to go a darker shade of white but they remain ivory coloured. Its once again that time of the month when we have no money.  We got sky tv installed so that we can watch films on there and so that Saul can watch his football with spending as much money. But still the money seems to just run out so quickly. He gets paid in just over a week and so do I. We have plenty of food so don't worry. And we also have electricity and a phoneline etc etc. We are okay. Boo has enough dry bits to keep his whiskers shaking for another fortnight and enough wet food for him to dribble it all over the kitchen floor in gooey duck and gravy trails.  Yesterday the people came to replace the front door. He's redone the lock which means new keys, and he's also redone and painted all of the windows. Thats good because now we can atleast see out of them. Of course its not just that they are dirty - they had not been painted in 10 years. So they look much much better. From where I am now, I can see through the lounge into the bedroom and out of the patio doors, and straight to the top of Canary Wharf which is flashing at me happily. Thats just coz they don't want planes to crash into it. Its quite a sight really. I remember when I first visited here, and stayed for the night being transfixed on the view. Of course in a lot of ways it doesn't beat looking out and seeing trees and rivers etc but its amazing all the same.  I'll talk to you more about london when I'm not so tired. I didn't sleep well last night and Boo woke me up early and so I am worn out. Theres a film on tv so I may watch that, then do some of my e-mails in my inbox and then head to bed. I hope Saul isn't in too late from seeing that band. I could have gone but I just couldn't face it. The idea of peace and quiet and writing what I had felt I must, seemed too good an opportunity to miss.  Lucy

       And this should take us by its end, to this day hopefuly. I hope its not come across in a bad way so far.  I haven't got over it. Leaving you back In January, and the last thing I said to you was BYE as you walked out of the door to school, grumpy because mum was on at you to take your cookery stuff which weighed a tonne. You'd not believe me but even today I was telling someone about how I used to cook with you, and how good you were. You see you are so special that no matter how much time passes I still feel you are part of me at all times. My tears are running freely down my face right now, and our cat is staring at me probably thinking "they look tasty" but its difficult to distance myself from stuff when writing it down.  Time went by and I remember your birthday. I remember the days leading up to it, looking at the money in my wallet and thinking how I could get on a train and come down to see you and we could have gone to pizza hut like we used to and you could have got a salad bowl and half filled it with bacon bits and nothing else. For someone reading this it probably sounds amusing but its all the little things......they all add up to make you. They all add up to make what you are to me. Who you are to me. Instead I sent a text to dad about it and he sent one back saying I was living in Cloud Cuckoo land and I knew that I didn't want to come back to argue more. So I spent hours walking around shops, and I got you a t-shirt, and a few games and put them in a padded envelope. I spent all of my money on you but money can't tell you how much you mean to me. I knew it wasn't the same as seeing me.  I sat there wondering whether I should get you this cd or not and in the end thought that you were your own person and a voucher was best because you could get what you wanted but at the same time it felt so impersonal. Anyway it went in the post and paid extra to make sure it got to you on time. Would you believe we didn't eat for 2 days that week because we ran out of money and i'd spent it on posting your present. It didn't bother me though. To be honest there have been times when I've not eaten in days and not noticed. Not that I've lost any weight on it.  I thought that when it came around to mum's birthday maybe we'd all have spoken but we hadn't. Nothing had changed so I did the same thing. Went out and bought presents and put them in a padded envelope and sent them off. I got a card back from mum not signed with love or anything so I knew that was her way of telling me that I'd ended it and she was just being civil now. I can't tell you how confusing that was. To put the cards from you and her up, and look at them thinking "Ooh they remembered me, and they do still think about me", but at the same time knowing that they weren't signed with love and that they were material indications that mum was calling it quits. It just seemed obvious from her cards that she had finished with me. So although I've kept the cards they hurt me because they are a reminder of what I had, and a kick in the face to say "you lost it".  Months went by and I didn't hear from any of you. I told friends that I missed you so much and I swear they must feel like taking my head and smashing it against something very hard by now, but they didn't - they just told me that one day you'd understand why it happened and you'd not hate me and you'd want to see me again. So when I was in a pub one evening trying to put a happy face on, celebrating a friend's birthday (he's a pain in the arse) and my phone beeped and it said there was a message from you I was half nervous and half excited. I pressed the button to see what it said but it then said there wasn't a message and I was fraught. I thought it might have been a fault with the phone and then a week later I got another one, and it said there was a message but when I opened it there was nothing. I then got worried and I sent an e-mail to Dad.  I only wanted to know whether you were okay and whether ...well everyone was alright really. Dad replied saying that you didn't care and if you were contacting me it would be tell me that mum was upset and that I should sort it out. So I sent a reply to you and asked you whether you were okay and I got one back saying just "Yeah I'm okay".  I didn't know whether it was from you afterall because I wasn't sure whether Dad wasn't using your phone. Then we started to text back and forth and I phoned you. I thought "Great - maybe I'll be able to visit him while he's on his summer holidays" and I was so excited in a nervous way. I just knew that when I saw you I'd cry because I'd wanted it to happen for so long. But I also knew that mum would be reminded about all that had happened and she would probably hate me still. After I put down the phone we had things happen in our flat. The boiler stopped working and we got a bloke to come and fix it but he was a mistake on the company employing him's list and he actually knew nothing about heating so he managed to wire the mains wire of the switch for the boiler to the cabinet in which it was encased shorting out the electrics in the flat more or less. Bulbs went one by one and we had to get people in emergency to fix things.  I got my money out one day, and the next it was all gone. Saul's parents sent us a money package half way through the week for us to get some food but other than that I don't think I went outside of the door. I knew that as time went by they'd (mum and dad) be thinking that I was stringing you along and being cruel. I knew I had to do something and come and visit soon but I had no money. I also knew that if I told mum and dad I had no money, they'd say "I told you so - what sort of life is that" and that things would get awful again. So I said nothing and counted down the day til I could afford to visit. And I kept that money guarded in my wallet and I promised myself that the letter would be in the post the next day and maybe the next week I'd be with you.  The letter went off and I got no reply. And so a week later I thought maybe you might not have got it. So I bought a small book of botanical postcards and I wrote one out with another letter on it and I sent that too. And I'm sat here a week and a half later and I know that you've probably got both of the letters but that for some reason, mum and dad don't want me to visit.  So that takes me up to today. Because I'm sat here and Saul's gone out to see a friend's band play but I've chosen not to go because I've got this on my mind and I thought I might feel more.....settled if I could atleast write all of this down. I'm not sure whether I do. I've been crying for hours and I've used up so much bog roll that we've got none left. On a daily basis I see things or think things that I want to tell you Ben. You are just the same person in my head and you are close enough in my conscious mind that I constantly reach out to you and picture doing things or saying things, but as the days go by, the things I want to show you or say go down the pan because as the days tick by, so do the moments when I could be spending with you. Of course I love Saul and I'm not saying that I don't want to be with him. What I mean is that for every day I think of you, its a reminder that its another day I'm not in your life in any shape or form. In fact you might be getting to the point right now when you don't even think of me. I could be fading from your memory - just someone that used to live with you and was quite nice at the time.  Someone infact that thinks you are an angel and I will cherish every memory I have of being with you, and pray that I'll have more memories one day to hold onto. This is the last diary entry where I'll be trying to explain things, and the ones from now on will deal with daily thoughts or things I've done. Things that I would like to share with you. I'll do today's ordinary BLOG in a moment when I've got myself together and had a drink. Its far too hot here and the kids outside are playing football and distracting me.  Love always  Lucy

       Well I was just about at the part where I'd gone to stay with Cousin Amanda wasn't I?  Well her house was lovely but I couldn't settle down and I think mum had thought that I'd stay there with them for a week or so to get my head straight and to allow her some space but no sooner had I got there one day, I wanted to be away the next. Her Son Matthew made me nervous (a boy half my age) and I was even scared to interact with her daughter Charlotte who made me feel like a freak. I sat downstairs with Amanda and Mark (her husband) one evening, and we had a beer and watched football and had a curry and talked over things. I had a job to stop myself from crying and Amanda said that mum was just finding it difficult coping with me getting a boyfriend and that she was sure things would work out. She said she'd phone mum in the morning to say I was okay and to talk to her, and so very very late indeed we all went to bed and I lay awake most of the night. I didn't sleep.  There were things I could have done there. They had a kitten and the area was very pretty but I was just lonely and scared and I knew no-one. I was always twice as nervous as you Ben - even when I was double your age. You've got so much more going for you than I had. Everything's going well for you and I really cross my fingers you never get ill like I did. If you don't nothing can stop you.  I felt so nervous at Amandas that I couldn't stay so I told her I wanted to go home and she said okay she'd take me to the station. Saul sent a text saying why didn't I go in the morning and he'd meet me, we'd go for lunch or something and then I'd get the train home. So I met him and we went for something to eat and I came and saw his flat which was okay but was as all mens flats where they live alone are - it needed cleaning and redecorating. (least of my worries). We watched a bit of tv, I calmed down and then he took me to the station and I came home. I remember mum making an effort to make things better but I was so nervous. She cooked me my favourite meal which at the time was fried rice, and I didn't even eat it I felt so sick.  It ticked along for a fortnight and then came the time when I had to decide whether I ever wanted to see Saul again, or whether I should just say sorry I couldn't. And I've got no idea what would have happened if I'd have said sorry no I couldn't, but at the time I was so scared that I needed a friend so losing him seemed unbearable. When mum and me had argued I used to run over to the field and sit under the tree on the hill on the phone to him crying and I had no idea what to do but I wanted to talk to someone. The more mum shouted at me trying to get me to stop seeing Saul, the more nervous and scared of what was happening I got. And so what mum did was push us closer together and not actually what she intended which was to pull us apart.  Looking back on it, theres no way of knowing whether if she hadn't been so angry and reacted the way she did, we'd have ever got as close so quickly. I actually doubt it. Because what ended up happening was that mum and dad said one day "What do you want to do then? You want to go and stay with him for a few months to get your head straight?!" and I think they were joking but after one of our arguements thats what I did. I took my money out and got the train to Paddington and sent him a text saying "please can I come and stay with you for a bit" and he wasn't sure at the time. But he said yes.  You see we hadn't known each other all that long really. And even though we were good friends, its one thing being friends and its another staying under the same roof as someone for a fortnight or more. Things didn't get any better for me. I don't know what it was like at home then but dad sent me text messages daily to find out whether I was okay. I thought he cared then and even though we'd all argued I felt safe enough. Saul looked after me and although I spent most days crying he seemed to understand why. He liked mummy and daddy you see. His mum and dad were always horrible to him and when he came down the first two times, he said to me he wished he had parents like ours. In fact he said that he wished he could be part of the family because he felt so safe there with us. I dont remember much of the good stuff from that first visit really. I remember him playing on the playstation with you and you beating him, and him farting lots but other than that most of it is a blank.  Anyway about 2 months later I came home. I'd lost a lot of weight. That was about the first time in my life I've fitted into a size twelve! I think mum was glad to have me home. But things didn't get any better. Things just yoyoed getting worse and then slightly better and then much worse. Things wouldn't happen much when you were home which I'm glad of. I wouldn't have liked you to see it all. We'd take you to school and I'd get home and it would be just me and mum and we'd argue and I'd cry and she'd follow me around the house shouting trying to get me to do what she wanted or to get through to me what she thought was wrong. I know you'll find it hard to understand - I hope you never find out what thats like but I felt nervous when it was just me and mum at home. I tried not to mention Saul, and even though I went to see him for the day here and there I thought the best way to deal with things was to pretend it wasn't there. Which was probably stupid.  Then one day we were in town and shopping in Somerfields and Judy (do you remember big fat scary Judy?) came in and shouted something stupid like "How's the Saulrus?" and I hadn't prompted her to say it. There was nothing I dreaded her saying more really, but I couldn't shut her up. She just grinned and kept asking about it. Mummy got upset and threw the basket at me and shouted and called me names right in front of everyone and that was when it got really bad. I know mum didn't mean half of the things she said. But they hurt so much. I am a coward. I can't cope with things the way I used to.  I never cried until I got ill and then I seemed to cry all of the time. I left for another stay with Saul hoping things would calm down. Which they didn't. It just happened like that for ages and ages, with me coming home, things getting bad, and then me leaving again. And it nearly killed me and probably did the same to mum and dad too. I don't think it was anything any of us wanted. One day mum said that we needed help and I thought "thank god - she wants us to all go and see someone to get help to cope with this" but she didn't mean that. She thought I was mad and needed help - and that she was perfectly fine. And that was when things hit rock bottom.  I left and I was gone for about 6 months. Dad kept texting me threatening to sell the car and I'd be sat here in the flat, dreading that bleep from the phone because although it meant that he remembered who I was, it also meant he was going to say more things that would hurt me and I'd sit there and cry and cry and Saul would come home from work and find me sat staring at the wall. In fact he himself thought I needed help at one point. I think I did too - I thought I was losing it. We went on holiday to Scotland. Saul thought it would be a good idea to get away and to calm down a bit and I desperately wanted to get out of London because it takes a lot of getting used to.  I remember one day feeling low. Really low. I was thinking about Granny and how she had various mental problems and I was thinking maybe I was like her, and that maybe I was a nut afterall. I was angry that I wasn't able to see you anymore and I was blaming myself. I sat there and watched some family on this cruise boat we went on around the islands and this girl was bouncing her brother on her knee and I swear I was so upset I felt I had no choice but to leave the same room as them. Because if I hadn't I think I'd have either pushed the whole family over the side of the boat in sheer frustration (and then got arrested) or cried in front of everyone. I did enjoy the holiday and I think some of my first good memories of being with Saul come from there.  I showed you pictures didn't I. Those are things I hold onto in my head.  When we got back though it was the same as before. Dad was phoning all of the time saying I should go back because I was enrolled on the full time course at Lackham and I needed to have an interview. I phoned and rearranged the interview so I could make it when we got back from the holiday and then about 2 days before the interview they phoned and said the course had been cancelled. That left a void because that was what was making Dad want me back home and if you took that away it meant that the only thing that could get me home was mum somehow changing her mood. And she didn't.  I was so upset Ben. I know you think I probably was out having fun and I was coping and that you and mum and dad were the only ones upset but if truth be told most of the times I expect you were sat there thinking about me, I was sat in a room with the lights off crying my eyes out wondering what on earth I could do to get you back.  And nothing has changed. Right now I'm sat here writing this hoping that one day you'll read this and the daily diary entries I make and understand me and not hate me. I really honestly thought things were getting better when I started the part time college course. I had it planned out in my head and I thought if I could only get through that course everything could fall back into place but it never did.  It started off okay. We were talking about me getting a part time job to help pay for the course etc but then mum and dad started finding jobs for me that meant that I would need to move back home and if I did that I would have lost Saul. You'll understand one day what I mean when I say that I just couldn't lose him. He felt like my security mattress against the world - and my best friend all rolled into one. If anything happened I knew that I could always fall apart and he'd help me pick up the pieces.  College was great. I could see my work coming on in leaps and bounds. I planned that Saul would finish his nursing course around the time I had finished my first year of study, and that I could maybe persuade him to move down to Bath or somewhere close and then things would be much easier. I could see everyone without being torn in all directions. And once I'd qualified I was going to work as a freelance designer and he could do his nursing and I'd do my garden design, and we'd live somewhere close to you so that you could come around whenever you wanted etc. I imagined mum helping me sort out curtains and bringing around old duvets etc. Because I think if things had been okay she'd have done all that. Because we were best friends too. When Saul was working nights I imagined you all coming over, and me cooking and things being normal.  That vision felt so good. Then at Christmas mum got upset again about Saul not sharing out some sweets and things got bad again. In front of you I tried not to cry or to show that things were happening but they were and in the most unlikely places. For instance we went out for a walk and no sooner had we got around the corner of the road mum started shouting at me again. So I came home in tears and the next day was gone again.  And I stupidly thought that in January after the stuff that happened at Christmas, mum would have calmed down and I'd still be able to go to college and come down and stay with you and we could do fun stuff and then I'd go back to live with saul for the rest of the week. But when I came down In January mum refused to speak to me, and dad told me he thought Saul was gay and by the time I got home from the station I was crying and mum wouldn't come in the same room as me. I'd promised you that I'd take you swimming and I was looking forward to it and then the morning you went to school, mum and dad came in and sat down and started on me.  It was the same conversations as before only more extreme. Mum said that I had to make up my mind where I wanted to live because they wouldn't let me visit anymore. I had to either go back to live with you and see Saul once a month or something, or leave and if that was the case she said I could never come back. I was really upset and I ran upstairs and mum followed me up. It went very bizarrely in moods. One moment she'd see me in tears and wonder what on earth had happened between us to get it that bad, and she'd come and hug me. And the next she'd be slapping me and shouting again. I remember this like it was yesterday. Dad was on the landing doing the new bannisters, and mum came into my room where I was stood crying looking out of the window. She said "If you leave this house you'll never see Ben again because I won't let you. It's not fair on him. He's got so much going for him and I won't have you messing his life up as well as your own".  Dad said "don't say things like that" but mum kept on saying that they had to think of you and that I was doing you no good. And I suddenly felt so hated. The next day mum went out all day and wouldn't stay in the house with me, and so I got dad to give me a lift and I left. I honestly felt hated. How else could mum say something like that? How else could she think that I'd ever do anything to harm you or lead you astray? I worshiped the ground you walked on and I loved you more than life itself.  And now you're just as huge a part in my life as ever only now I have to sit here staring at a picture instead of seeing your grinning face staring back at me over the dinner table. Busy pushing the chicken around the plate because you don't like it and eating nothing but the mashed potato. And now I'm sat here crying again. You see my life will never be complete without you. You are my brother and I love you sooo much. I just wish you could understand how I feel, and see that things aren't as you think they are.  This sort of brings me to the end of this entry but I want to write more because its all flowing out and I'm in tears and Saul is out so its best I get it all out of my system and into this BLOG while I have the chance and it doesn't mean Saul seeing me in such a state. The next entry will be about things which are happening now.

      I usually write diary entries to myself. However recently I've been working through feelings again and someone suggested that I write my feelings down as though I were speaking to you *BEN* instead of just the usual. At this precise moment it feels like a good idea because there's so much I wanted to say to you. So much I wanted to show you. And yet once again theres something not there and I'm not with you. I'm not even sure what it is this time. I phoned you, and we talked and I honestly thought that mum and dad would then be okay with my visiting. I couldn't come down for a while. I know you don't really understand why - you will one day. If you ever read this and you're looking back on that time I didn't visit right away because I have no money. What money I do have has recently due to added financial pressure come in the door and gone straight out of it again.  A fortnight went past Ben, and I counted down the days til I got paid again just so that I had money to visit. Each day that went past I knew you'd be thinking that I didn't want to come, or wasn't all that bothered. When I got that money I sat down and wrote mum and dad a letter. I thought Dad would have finished college by then and it would be best for mum and dad to read what I had to say so it went in the post and I waited to hear something back. I didn't hear anything and I was worried that they might not have got my letter so a week and a bit later I wrote another one. This one was written on a postcard with an old botanical print on it because I know mum likes that sort of thing (so do I). Its been more than a week since I wrote that and I've not heard from you still.  I'm taking that to mean that something has happened, and mum and dad are angry with me again. They don't want to see me. I know you won't understand this right now. I guess you probably think that I'm choosing to be away from you and that I'm not at all bothered about what happens. When you get to a certain age you just want certain things for yourself.  I got ill when I was fairly young and I should have been out enjoying myself and I couldn't. I didn't have any friends, and you were my world. I have to admit that people over at your school said that I was your second mum and I couldn't have been prouder if I had tried. In fact I liked the idea. Not only because you were so wonderful, but because I fitted in with the parents. At 17 you aren't supposed to fit in best with people who have been married for years and have kids. You are supposed to be out clubbing or whatever but I've never been like that and I'm still not. Nothing has changed. Dad didn't seem to be home alot, and when I passed my test me, you and mum used to go out and do things and you and mum were both everything to me.  But at a certain point in everyone's life, you have feelings for someone else. That doesn't mean ordinarily you lose everyone else. It just means that something happens and you find the need to have someone else there too. I met Saul online and I honestly wasn't looking for a way to move out or anything like mum thinks. The first time I ever phoned him it was because someone on the support group I had was being nasty and I wanted to know what he wanted me to do (eg report the person to Yahoo or something). I heard his voice and he sounded so confident and kind. I know mum thinks he's scum and everyone has bad points.....but it went from there. Nothing was planned. Mum wanted me to have friends and so she said invite him down to stay and he arrived and his first visit went fine. I'm not sure you'll remember this but mum and dad liked him. They said he was funny and creative and nice, and that he should come down again.  After he left for the first time I wanted to see him again and it just went from there. And it was when me and him got close that mum changed her mind about him and all of this started.  I can't describe to you how it feels to be now. Me and mum had always been so close. She was my best friend aswell as my mummy, and the first time she slapped me I was shocked because you know Mum never slapped me or you. And after that it got a regular thing. Mum was scared that I'd move out, and so she got worried and she thought I suppose that if she shouted at me and told me she was cross at me, I'd just never see him again. Like maybe she used to do when you closed the door to your room when you were little and had Tom around and he used to try to put the cats out of the window. I think she thought I'd just stop seeing him. But it was so much harder than that because not only was he a close friend but I liked him a lot.  Once mum had slapped me the first time and I hadn't stopped seeing him, she didn't know what to do. She was just scared of losing me I think, but the way she reacted to me then has done something I can't get over. She has scared me. I know NONE of you can see that. Dad doesnt understand and mum doesn't think she's done anything. I used to wake up shaking because I was scared of what mum would say or do.  I'm sorry I'm a coward. I couldn't handle what she was doing to me. If you imagine what it would be like if I had turned around and slapped you or called you names (and meant it), you'll be able to imagine what I felt like. I was scared and I didn't know what to do. And I was not only scared of mum but I was scared of the world. They put me on a train to Cousin Amanda's because they didn't know what to do either. I was so nervous on that train leaving (that was the first time I'd ever gone further than college on my own) that I was almost sick. I wanted to be with someone I knew but I didn't really know Amanda. You don't know her either really. We didn't really see much of her while we were growing up. I was scared and London is a big place (even the Station) for someone as nervous as I was. I remember texting Saul while on the train saying I was on my way to a cousins and I was scared, and I didn't even know where I was supposed to meet her. I had no money with me - only a few clothes and my phone. He came to meet me right from the door of the train and took me to where Amanda was waiting and they spoke for a bit and then I went off on the train with Amanda to where she lived.  I can't tell you how much I was hurting. I felt like my insides had been carved out with a spoon. I was scared, worried, sad and heartbroken. Every time I'd felt like that before in Life I'd gone to mum and she'd have given me a hug or talked me through it. But mum was the one I was scared of, and so I had no-one.  This entry is getting really really long so what I'll do is I'll save this bit and I'll do another entry - so if you do ever read this you won't get bored to tears and won't have to read it all in one go.

      Well from out of the blue yesterday I got ill.  Bad stomach, bad aches and pains and feeling sick.  Saul came home to me having been sat in bed all day (very rare I stay in bed) and feeling very low and ill indeed.  He went back and forth getting me an icelolly because I was thirsty but I wanted something really cold and we didn't have anything.  Then he announced that it was the CLOG BBQ that evening and he was planning on going. I'd not moved all day so was feeling really ill and very obviously couldn't go.  I begged him to stay home with me.  All I wanted was a bit of TLC and looking after and I thought back to when he was ill.   I went into Stratford at 8 in the morning on a sunday morning when nothing was open and sat for hours waiting to get some drugs for him from the chemist because he was so ill.  I thought about how I waited on him hand and foot because I cared so much and then compared that to him wanting to go out and leave me and I have to confess I'm still upset about it.  He went out saying he'd only get something to eat and then come home an hour or so later.  He left me in tears which showed how important I was really.  He came back at 10 having had a few to drink and I felt very unimportant and ignored.  He is top of my priorities and yet I'm way down the list on his.  And even today he seems unaware of what it means.  Going out leaving me in tears and ill so that he can get something to eat.  I'm upset.  He can't see the difference between being angry and being upset.  I'm not angry.  I'm upset that I dont' mean as much to him as he does to me.  Today I'm feeling a little better illness wise.  But I'm still upset.  Its not being helped by the fact that I have a stinking bad head and he's got music channels on very loud and sees nothing wrong with it.  I keep asking him to turn it down and he won't and says that I should stop wassacking him.  Last night I had a dream where we had 2 kids and he was ignoring me and I asked him whether he loved me and he said he wasn't sure and he went off and left me with the kids.  I'm not sure how to convey to him that the way he shows me how he feels is wrong.  I mean if you love someone do you walk out leaving them in tears just to go and have a BBQ with mates?  Not if you love them you don't.  I'm a bit low at the moment as you can tell.  And still nothing from my parents........

      Well going back about 6 months, we had a divan bed with iffy mattress but atleast it was off of the floor.  Saul put his knee onto the bed one night and the whole bottom of the divan broke, leaving us with a mattress alone.  So for 6 months now we've been sleeping on the mattress with it lying on the floor.  This was at first a novel experience, then it became fairly acceptable because the extra support from the floor gave the mattress a firm feel which did my back a bit of good.  However now the mattress has given up the ghost too.  The springs are coming through and I wake up every day with pains all over.  So we ordered a new bed.  We went online because we thought we'd find one cheaper online and indeed we did - no idea what the mattress will be like though.  Probably the cheapest one you can get knowing our luck.  That said though, atleast hopefuly the springs will not be poking out through the top layer.  we ordered this bed 3 weeks ago.  Still nothing from the people who are supposed to be delivering it.  I wouldn't usually complain but I feel really ill this morning.  That might not have anything to do with our sleeping conditions but in this frame of mind I'm inclined to blame anything! lol.  So Saul had a half day today at uni, and therefore we got a lie in.  In fact we stayed in bed until about 10.30 and then he got up, got dressed and left.  Only when I got up to kiss him goodbye did I realise that our back gate in our courtyard was open.  Its always locked so that perplexed me a bit.  I shouted out of the door to Saul, why is our back gate open?  He said in reply "Because the man is painting our back door and windows...."  Yeah great - everything gets a lick of paint.  Thats got to be good.  But he could have asked!  I was wandering around the flat in my wee shorts with my comfy but rather explicit skin tight vest top.  Its been so hot here (in the UK we have not got used to heat yet - we don't get much of it) and so I've been tossing and turning in bed ending up on top of the covers most nights.  The result of this is that I look as rough as a badgers arse when I get up - and who was I confronted with?  Some slobby looking hairy bloke with a grin on his face staring in.  So I've barricaded myself in lol.  I'm in the lounge with the door shut and the curtains pulled together so the twat can sit outside and wonder what I'm doing but not know lol.  I mean he could have knocked on the door to ask if he could come into our back garden..........it wouldn't have taken much.  In the meantime I feel sick.  I don't know why.  I've got a toxic feeling in my stomach which would usually have been put down to lots of fizzy drinks the day before or alcohol but I had neither of these things yesterday.  In my paranoid mind I'm thinking "oh my god what if I'm pregnant" but I'm trying to keep a lid on that thought at the moment.  Anyway I'll leave it there for now and will write more when I get a chance.  Not much to report today really other than feeling sick and the pervy bloke at the window.  Hopefuly the feeling will pass.  I don't have the money at the moment to buy any medication for a bad stomach......ewwww........
