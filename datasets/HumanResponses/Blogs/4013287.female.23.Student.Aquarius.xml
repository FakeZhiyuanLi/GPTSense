       Phoebe : Hey, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J'. Coincidence?   Chandler : Hey, that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'.   Girls poker night&nbsp;was sweet. We gave each other chips when we run out, we played for gummy spongebob hamburgers, we took a break in the middle to go get ice cream, and to find the remote. After Kimberly spent 30 minutes talking about needing to change the channel if she wasn't too lazy to get up.   So we might not be quite ready to play against the big guns, and yeah, we have to run to the computer to check the order of what beats what, and the winner (Ali) was also the second person to get out at the beginning, but life is still good and girls poker night is  sweet .   Play more games. With friends.    &nbsp; fyi here's what beats what:  urlLink http://www.worldpokertour.com/pokercorner/ranking/

      I got to play soccer today. And not just any soccer; It was the most competitive recreational soccer - ever. We're talking the ref said he was going to walk off and let the two teams play the second half without a ref.   I played for the other team, which&nbsp;I thought was a good decision...they needed a girl and I didn't want to get hurt playing against them.&nbsp;The team&nbsp;was an interesting mix, one other girl, and about a 50/50 split of white and jamaican guys. The other girls didn't want to go to the other team because the Jamaicans were notorious for not passing the ball to girls. I said I'd go though, I didn't really know anybody on either team, and I figured I'd get more exercise since they had no subs.&nbsp; I didn't realize that I would be in for such a treat!  I found it refreshing; There was only one person who refused to pass me the ball, and his teammates - all of them - kept yelling at him for it. All the rest of them recognized that I could play, and were comfortable giving me the ball and working with me. And they appreciated having another girl. The Jamaicans played a very different style, more like indoor, where you move in and out of your position freely. I enjoyed it, even if it did leave for lots of breakaways for the other team when everyone went up (the Americans on the team were pretty stuck in their spots).   Anyway,&nbsp;it was a beautiful day, and&nbsp;it is&nbsp;refreshing to play on a big outdoor field and to be able to rely a little more on space than on footwork. I really hope I can find a team to play on in St Louis.

       urlLink    My elusive brother Nathan, who introduced me to this site (though he doesn't know it). Nathan also just informed me about a very special family relationship with James Valentine, guitarist for Maroon 5...he was our paperboy back in the day. Such a small world!&nbsp; urlLink
