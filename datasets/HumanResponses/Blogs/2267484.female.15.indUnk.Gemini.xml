      "Tolerance is the highest form of education."  And I am definitely not educated enough. But to be frank, I think if this is true I would be more educated than some people at least. Something to be proud of huh.  But I can't help it when I get irritated, or in common language, pissed off. Arh. Slowly, I can feel that my mind is opening, and seeing more and more and most of all, rejecting less of it. Which is good. yah.  At the moment, two people are irritating me. Thank goodness, irritation only strikes once in a while. But when it does they bother me enough.  Some times, people pretend to be someone they are not. But what if being someone you ARE, will hurt certain other people around you?   And what if some people who matter to you can't accept who you are.  The betrayal of trust. The assertion that you are guilty, without even a proper trial (or an understandable from my point of view.)  And rubbing salt into the wound.  Perhaps the person may not have meant it, perhaps she did. But oh well.  Whatever there is, we (or I) have to go on.

      Where are you God? Where is the light guiding in my life? Why am I always so alone. Around people and yet alone. I"m falling apart. No. Try positive language. I am feeling worse than normal, but I will do what I can. I will create my own light and shine. No use waiting for luck to fall down from the sky. But yes, I do want guidance. And I seriously need it yes.

      I can't stand it. Mom irritates me to the brim, I love her and yet I cannot stand it. I'm procrastinating. Being a big idiot. All three dimensions of my life are messed up: relationships, sense of purpose (or lack thereof), health (not too bad but not good.) I wonder why I'm still living.

      Dear blog, seriously I don't know what I'm thinking. Xiaodan did a personality survey for me today: a story with hidden meanings. And I remember. That one result showed that. I like to... play with the feelings of other people. Never ever thought of that before. I don't think I do it often. But looking inside me, I realize that... that... the trait is there.  (typing on THE NEXT DAY):  I need to learn to stand on my own feet Reach towards the sky I need to find that light within me Because I can't rely on no one to always hold A Touch in front.

      Sigh sigh sigh sigh sigh. Clouded mind.  It has always been said. That one has to fail, in order to learn to pick him/herself up. And then go on. After all, "Failure is the mother of Success."  But there are people who fail and never get up. People who have failed so miserably but think they have succeeded. And of course, people who have succeeded but failed in not realizing their success. There are people around us.   That will fail. And we can't reach out a helping hand. But they may never pick themselves up.  And the people who get hurt is not them. Not those who commit mistakes. But others who realize the mistakes, and carn do nothing about it.  Except sit and get hurt. Baring the consequences. The hurt. For them.

      It is difficult to be optimistic when the reality sets in. The problem is that I think I'm born an optimistic person.   Seriously though, no matter how horrid things are, they always COULD be far worse.

      My opinion's so skewed.  But seriously. To me you are nothing but a pathetic soul.  I try to pity you, understand you, help you.  I know I sound so arrogant now, but that was what I tried to do.  I know you have so much potential.  But I'm tired of this, of making sacrifices, and even threatening my own identity.  Sorry I'm not that selfless.  To me. You are just. Some pathetic human being. Who doesn't exactly. Make that much. of a difference... to the world.  Maybe I'm being bad, but perhaps this is just the truth about me.  You are just so pathetic, I really take pity on you. I see you of so little value, I don't care anymore.   I'm sorry God, I guess I need  loads more empathy, loads more tolerance.
