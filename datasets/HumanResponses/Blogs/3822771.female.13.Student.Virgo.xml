      Well my weekend was awesome!! okay, here it comes.........first thursday night (i didnt have to go to practice! thank the lord!) So instead of going to practice i went down to blue springs, missouri, with my&nbsp;mom, sisters, and brother (eric) around twelve. We hung out with my aunt, uncle, and cousins that live down there. At seven we went to a play that they were in, The Music Man (Gregs favorite!!) It was awesome, just like the movie, then we went back to their house (its 11:00 by now) and sat outside and my uncle played the guitar, and we just sat outside, listened, to music, and taled until about 3:00, then we all came inside, and talked for a while...again, then we eventually went to bed. we all woke up arouond 12:00 the next day, my family ate and then had to leave right away. We got about half way home and our car broke down, so we ahd to sit near the side of the road until my dad got there (about two an a half hours later) we funaly got home, and i was so tired i just went to bed. The next morning i had to wake up at 7:00 A.M. for our 3v3 soccer tournament in lincoln. When we got to lincoln it was raining and only about 65 degrees outside. It was NOT fun to play soccer in that weather! We lost our first game, 4-3 against Xplosion (we shoulda won that though) and then we won our second game against the Stingers (what a name) 4-2. and then we played tropical storm (a council bluffs team) 5-4.we only played three games saturday...thank youo god! Sunday i had to wake up even earlier, 6:30 A.M. We got to Lincoln around 8:oo, our first game was at 8:30 against the elk ice, we won 3-0, our second game against the hot shots was&nbsp; seriously a miracle, i have no idea how we won that game (3-2) So now we made it to the championship game, against the Stingers again....We played pretty well the first half, it was only 1-1 at halftime, the second half we came out and sucked! we they scored two goals right away...so now the score is 3-1, them...but some how we manage to get a couple break aways and score off them...and got it back to 3-3, and then with about 20 seconds left, i get a break away, one on one, and miss the goal by the two inches! So we went into overtime. Luckily we got kickoff, we dribbled it up right away, took a shot and it bounced off their defender and so we got a corner, liz took the corner, it bounced of their defender again, so liz got to take the corner again. This time it it went right past their defnder across to the other side, they almost got it (for a break away) but some how i ended up with the ball, i took a shot, it hit the bar and came back towards me i kicked it again, it hit the feet of their defender, i get the ball again, this time i shoot, and finally score!! So we won, 4-3 in overtime, yah for us, so then we go get our medals, and pictures, and then we all decide to go out to eat&nbsp;at some restaurant in omaha, and me and my dad are driving away, when i spill some ice cream on my medal, and jersey, and im looking at my medal and it said third place! i was like "Wait a minute, we did get first place right?" and so my dad went and talked to michelle, everyone else's said first, so we went back to the fields, and got be a first place medal...lol..then we went to eat...yadda yadda yadda...i am really sore today! so that was my weekend, it was really fun!!...

       I've been thinking about something alot lately...and well some of you may know that i thought Dane (my sisters boyfriend) was an elf, well i think that i was way off, he cant be an elf really..........i think hes a hobbit. I mean he NEVER takes his shoes off, i mean if i had extremely hairy feet, i wouldnt take my shoes off either, unless, he is like some weird mixed up creature, like an elf/hobbit thing. hmmm....

       well today was kinda blan...i was woken up by my brother, sister, and cousin Clara (2 yrs old)...i went upstairs for a while a plyed with my other cousin Frannie (1 yr old) and then i came back downstairs and watched part of lord of the rings (ive never really gotten into those movies) and then i took a shower. I straightened me hair. Then I just kinda sat around til lunch. We had mac n cheese, and hotdogs. Then I got online for a while...no one was on so i got off...i went and watched a movie with my cousins..and then came to chat with cookie and kelsey. Cookie has a big secret that shes keeping from me and its driving me crazy NOT knowing what it is. Around 4:30 i got off to get ready for soccer. I went got my stuff on, and then i went to eat, i had pasta. its abotu 5:30 by now. Then we took Eric and Faye to there practice, I had to sit through that. Then around 7:00 we went to mine. I was a little late, but they hadn't really started yet. We started our normal touches, passing, running, stretching, weave, yadda yadda yadda, and then we started scrimmaging, we played 3v4..my team had 3 people...that was interesting....and then we played possesion, and some other stuff. and by now its like 8:30..we start stretching and then im outta there. Practice was really boring for me, i didnt have any of my real good buddies there (kelsey or becca) then we came home, showered, i had a malt, and then i got online again.&nbsp; Whad i tell yah, pretty blan, huh?

       well practice wasnt as bad as i thought it would be...it still sucked...but it was okay. except for one time when we were sitting there drinking our water, tom started talking about when you lose something you want it back (abby wants to play soccer sicne she tore her ACL) and then he said well when you lose your&nbsp;mom or dad, and then he looked at me and then said, or you uncle, then he paused, and then started llisting more things. i wasnt sure what that was suppose to mean, if it was a test to see how strong i am, but i was really starting to miss greg all over again, and i got tears in my eyes, and im still trying to figure out why he did that...i think that ahs to be the meanest thing ive ever heard him say to me for as long as ive known him...it really hurt me.

      You say you see no hope, you say you see no reason  We should dream that the world would ever change  You're saying love is foolish to believe  'Cause there'll always be some crazy with an Army or a Knife  To wake you from your day dream, put the fear back in your life...   Look, if someone wrote a play just to glorify  What's stronger than hate, would they not arrange the stage  To look as if the hero came too late he's almost in defeat  It's looking like the Evil side will win, so on the Edge  Of every seat, from the moment that the whole thing begins  It is...   Chorus:  Love who makes the mortar  And it's love who stacked these stones  And it's love who made the stage here  Although it looks like we're alone  In this scene set in shadows  Like the night is here to stay  There is evil cast around us  But it's love that wrote the play...  For in this darkness love can show the way   So now the stage is set. Feel you own heart beating  In your chest. This life's not over yet.  so we get up on our feet and do our best. We play against the  Fear. We play against the reasons not to try  We're playing for the tears burning in the happy angel's eyes  For it's...    These are the lyrics to the song that they played at Gregs funeral..i believe they have such a powerful meaning, love does conquer all..althougoh we sometimes doubt what love is and what effect it can have, love is gods biggest gift to us...but why cant we understand what love is until its gone? Cant we ever notice how good we have things, before they leave us..   Greg...only one word can describe why i miss greg so much..and thats love. Love, why didnt i realize what i had before he left..i sure wish i had! i miss greg so much!! :')

YAH!!  do you ever think that someone may be trying  to kill you? i think that...in fact i believe my sisters  boyfriend wants to kill me..he said he  worked for my arch nemisis in my other life  (the one before this one) which kinda creeped  me out, because what if he really does work  for him, and is really trying to kill me,  and hes just using my sister to get to  me...cause people that work for killers will  stop at nothing to kill their prey...hmm..unless  i some up with a plan to hide from him for the  rest of this life, or i could come up with a  plan on how to kill him, and everyone else that  works for me enemy, or i could just always  escape some awesomely cool way everytime im  really close to death..hmm  well im guess i should dwell on this, and think  of all possible solution, and non solution.... .......hmmmmm...................... .............................................. .............................................. .............................................. .............................................. .............................................. ..........................hmmm................ .............................................. .........................................hmmmmm ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... .......hmmmm................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... ............................................... .......................well that didnt turn out  so well....i feel like watching oceans eleven thats a great movie..it was my favorite for a  while, until i saw POTC anyways...oceans twelve  comes out in december i really want to see that.. even though most sequels suck..but hey who cares.. not ME!! well now im really gonna go watch it....

      well i havent been posting anything for a while because lately when i get online ive been going to a chat, the andy roddick chat. Its lots of fun, and ive been meeting tons of nice, cool people.  HAHA the other day i was in one of the rooms with a bunch of people my age and the this 19 year old from argentina came in and was like i need help, my girl firend wants to make out with me and have sex! we were like what? why are you telling us this? and then we started asking him questions that could possibly help him..it was so funny!!  if you wanna go sometime all you do is.. go to http://www.andyroddick.com make an account (its really easy and doesnt take long) then go to chat...it really couldnt be any easier...  My fourth was really fun!! Saturday we woke up around ten (which was really early considering we didnt get home and asleep until around 3:00am) and drove out there..we ate a little breakfast and then started grilling lunch, but until then we just sat around outside and played cards. The conversation while we were sitting around got quite interesting...someone had asked gina about her boyfriend dane (something like are you still going out) and i wanted to just let them know what she was dating so i said something about him looking like an elf and from there it flew!! my uncles bob, chris, matt, tom, and my grandpa had the time of their life teasing her about it. they started talking about how he lives in a tree and how he always has the same number of lines on the fudge shoppes cookies. and then they started giving him nicknames (this was interesting) they came up with:Keebler, Keeble, The Keeb meister, The Keeb Man, Keeb-man-do, Keebles, and the list goes on for quite some time..and then they mentioned something about wanting to meet him, so they made gina call him and ask him if he wanted to come, he said he would once he got off work if it wasnt too late, when my grandma found out he worked at a liquor store she defiantely wanted him over (and to bring some black velvet) after that thoguh things died down ... and it was about lunch time. We had beer butt chicken...man was that good. then we cleaned up lunch and started grilling dinner. A lot of us went to go ply bocce (pronounced botch ee) that was fun for a while..and then a couple of us went to play horse shoes...that was interesting considering two of my uncles were pretty wasted. then we went to check out my uncles brothers house which is like a 3 minute walk from there house..it was so huge...then we went back to the house and ate....then we played cards watched movies and snacked the rest of the night...oh and we did cookie jar (ill explain some other time) then we went home.... Sunday we hung around house all day until about 5:00 when my bros friends came over...and  my sisters came over and then my uncle and aunt came over with there kids...we grilled til about 9 or so then watched fireworks til about 12:00 it was so awesome...my brothers finale didnt go off so they covered it in Kleenexes and lighter fluid..it went up in flames ( the flames was seriously like 7 feet high) it was so great!! and then everyon went home...and well yeah thats about it.

      Today i did something I would usually never even think about doing...I watched tennis!! It was weird..I was interested in what was happening..and I was asking my dad questions...and he knew the answers...it was quite an interesting "fling" I had this morning.  Speaking of fling...what is the term you use for when you lose calories?? I believe, and Gina believe, that term is fling, but I've been told otherwise. Me and Gina started talking about this and this is what we came up with..To "fling" calories a person can: 1) Laugh 2) Exercise 3) Do the hokey pokey We believe that calories cling to your fat..and build up over time..to make a person definatley obese. So in order to "fling" them you must be working hard or shaking uncontrollably. Try it, it works I swear!  So...this is kinda awkward, nothing to say, at all.  I'm listening to David Wilcox right now..I love listening to his music...it's so relaxing...and it reminds me of my late uncle so much. Nothing could ruin my mood right now..its so relaxed and carefree....  Sometimes I wish I could fly..I would fly so high...so high into the sky, above the tallest buildings, above all the birds, I would fly up by the highest clouds and look down on all of God's creation. And then just for kicks I would spit, and then go back down on the ground and look for it..unless it would dissolve on the way down...THAT would be FUN!

      Goodness, I am very thankful for the summertime! This summer has been great for me spititully. I feel I have gotten way closer to God...I now see things in a different light, I find the reason behind things, and that I'm thankful for. I realize why some things may happen and some things may not, but I'm okay with whatever reason I find, and that I'm thankful for.  Thank You God for helping me through this summer. Thank You God for my family. Thank You God for You. Thank You God for all You've taught me this summer. Thank You God. Thank You God. Thank You God!

      well  haven't written anything in my blog for wuite awhile now... i guess theres not much to say really... i was really happy a couple days ago, i was on my way home from des moines and i started thinking about greg a lot, and it made me so happy just to know that i knew, i was related to him, and i had a special connection with him, god daughter. And every song i heard on the way home reminded me of him, and they did make me cry, but i know those tears are because i love him so much, and im so proud of him, they're just tears of overflowing love. I miss greg a lot but i know now that he is in a much better place watching his kids and wife all the time...
