      I am reading Eugenia Franval by Marquis de Sade. A tale of incest (de Sade did a lot of these...) and the effects of it on the family. Well, sort of. The whole thing starts out delightfully wicked, and then goes bad as the daughter and father are won over to morality, and, of course, feel really awful for what they've been doing. ...The ending is a lot like a Shakespearian tragedy ( urlLink http://www.sademania.com/ )

      I finished to read the bool " urlLink Lolita " from Vladimir Novokov. This is a very interesting book about a man who falls in love for a 12-years old girl. This book was made a  urlLink film  in 1962&nbsp;with the same name by Stanley Kubrick and there is another version with Jeremy Irons and Melanie Griffith in 1997 .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Also&nbsp;I saw the film  urlLink The Adventures of Baron Munchausen  (1988) this is&nbsp;the fantastic tale of a 17th century aristocrat, his talented henchmen and a little girl in their efforts to save a town from defeat by the Turks. Being swallowed by a giant sea-monster, a trip to the moon, a dance with Venus and an escape from the Grim Reaper are only some of the improbable adventures. (imdb.com)

      This weekend I saw "Signs" with Mel Gibson. After the death of his wife in a freak accident, Reverend Graham Hess questions his faith and even leaves the church. Six months later, he discovers a gigantic crop circle in his yard. Similar events happen all over the world. Graham's children think it's aliens, his brother thinks it's pranksters, and Graham doesn't know what to think. However, as more and more strange events occur, he realizes something big is coming, and it's probably not going to be friendly. ( urlLink www.imdb.com )

      This weekend I saw the film  urlLink The Majestic . Peter Appleton is a script writer during the 1950's who is suspected to be a Communist among many Hollywood film people (which is not true). Along the way, he gets into a freak car accident and suffers amnesia, then ends up in a small California town. There he lives in a run down movie theatre where he learns the magic of experiencing a movie in it. Soon, the Communist hunters find him and call him to testify before a Senate hearing committee. Also I saw the film  urlLink Dragonfly  where a grieving doctor is being contacted by his late wife through his patients near death experiences. ( urlLink www.imdb.com )
