         La Gioconda, or, the Mona Lisa. Painted by Leonardo DaVinci of the young wife of a merchant. Its painted on a thin sliver of wood, and, is admired by most all people to be considered an extraordinary painting. Her smile is unconsistent with paintings of the period, which makes it stand out. The way the folded hands make a triangle with the body is stunning.   The history of the Mona Lisa is interesting. DaVinci was asked to paint the wife of a merchant, and, it took him over four years to complete it, but, never gave it to the merchant. He took it with him to France, where it traveled from King Francis I. to the Louvre to Napoleon, then back to the Louvre. It was stolen, brought to Italy, sold, and then returned to the Louvre again. In 1956, they attempted an acid procedure on it, which damaged much of the lower half of the painting, but, was saved by many years of restoration. It now sits in the Louvre, unable to leave again.

      Welcome to Noodle Soup. I started a blog, not to long ago, called  urlLink Alphabet Soup . It is a group story writing blog. Well, this is it's newly founded sister blog, Noodle Soup.  The main purpose of this blog? Essay writing. Alot like www.everything2.com . But our goal is improving our writing ablity, whereas their goal is sharing knowledge, and writing really neat stuff. So, obviously you're not going to be reading this blog for good writers.  So, the name.. yeah, I had trouble with that one. My description of it? Alphabet soup, the blog for fictional stories, is a letter soup. You can arrange the letters however you want. The sister blog, which deals with essays, is non-fictional stuff, just a presentation of information. Noodles can be bent and stuff, and presented differently, but they are still the same noodle, the same info.  Wether or not people actually pick up on that, well, that's their problem. If someone has a better title, please tell me.

      Okay, when I woke up this morning, I knew the first half of my dream.  Then I went back to sleep, and had the second half.  As I sit here now, I cannot remember the first half, but I DO know it had nothing to do with the second half, so here's the second half.  We're in some type of alley, it's dark, I think, and we're all wearing orange shirts, pants, bike helmets, and pads.  We are all sitting on orange bikes as well, there are about ten people, we seem to be kids.  Someone says that we're now playing "group tag".  And from what the dream says, here are the rules.  There are two teams, let's say A and B.  One member from the five man group A is the "target" that all five members of group B are trying to tag.  The remaining four members of A are trying to protect the target as they race to the safety point, this game is played on bikes.  I am on group A protecting the target, and the target seems to be Vince from that old cartoon Recess.  We begin to race, it's pretty quick, Vince is in the middle, and we're surrounding him, being followed by the other team.  suddenly, I feel like I instatnly grow up fron at 9 to age 14, the age I am now.  There's a scene in the middle, that's supposed to be the race I suppose.  It's Bart Simpson riding on an orange bicycle in the street. It's now daytime, and we race down familiar hill, up a familiar driveway, to a familiar house.  The hill, driveway, and house are all that of my old neighborhod in OK, and we are going up there, the safe point seems to be in the house.    Suddenly, I become a memeber of group B.  Actually, all of the members of group B, let me explain.  First, I am one guy, in first person view, but I swerve left off into the yard and hit some bushes, I'm out.  Then, I'm one guy, but I swerve right and hit my old basketball goal.  Now, I'm the last member of group B.    I follow them into the garage, it seems like I'm back to msyelf again, but I'm undercover.  I follow the guy into my messy garage, this whole house is just like how it was when I lived in it.  He hides behind a bicycle, and I'm on the other side.  But I'm 14 again now, so I reach both arms around the bike, I move the left one to him, he moves to the right, and I quickly tag him with my right hand.    He stops, and I say "good job".  And we begin to walk out.  Then I wake up.  ***What I think***  I used to love the show Recess, and in some dreams for the past several months my old house in OK has been in them.

      Before I get to the main part of the dream, there is one part that I remember.  I am in Kakariko village from Zelda Ocarina of Time, and I pop out of a yellow deku flower, like in Majora's Mask, but instead, I fly horizontally like superman very quickly across the village.  The view is third person.  Now, onto the main part.  I'm some commander guy, from a starship it seems, around 35-40 maybe.  I'm in this treehouse like place, and the people there are weird.  They have these straw masks that turn into capes, and their clothes are very primitive and have designs on them made with fruit I guess.  I get a bad feeling from them.  For some reason, I leave and go into this desert like place, and I know I'm being followed by an appparent assasin.  As I continue into the desert, I find that I can "burrow" under some sand dunes, but are really blankets, and I cover up under them and stick my arm up to make a "hill" type thing.  I'm speaking into my watch communicator, when I feel the assasin standing on the "dune" over me, carrying a spear.  I'm talking to another officer, and I'm speaking about losing the war, and just dying, but then he reminds me of my wife and apparent family.  I then get a new resolve to fight.  I have the feeling of pushing up on the "blanket" to get him off of me, but suddenly I'm in this clay made house, with him standing outside a wooden door, and I push it and he goes flying back into another house (I'm in the house pushing the door in the same instant I'm pushing the "blanket", it just switches from the blanket to the house).  I look around and I see several villagers are dead.  This village almost looks like the one on Tatooine.  There is now what seems to be a "meanwhile, at such and such place" scene.  Some guy who's weirdly dressed is talking to a bunch of followers, saying that some army is going to be there before them, and they will definately lose the battle.  I think I'm standing next to Ben, a friend of mine, and I'm dressed up kinda like a jedi, almost like Anakin from Star Wars II.  Well, Anakin is also there, and he jumps into a tree, he'll follow Ben from there, I'll guard him from the ground.  How?  I'll move from shadow to shadow.  The trees casting the shadows are like fat Christmas trees, the kinds we had many of in OK and one in my front yard.  They cast long shadows in the neighborhood floodlights (we do seem to be in a neighborhood) and I duck into them, checking along the ground and wall to make sure my own shadow is properly hidden.  One time, I look on the wall and my arm is sticking out in the shadow on the wall, and I pull it back in so nobody can see me on a glance, but if they look harder the outline of my body is darker than the tree's shadow.  We start on one side of the house, and go around it to the other side, passing up the back side of the house.    We then get to the front, and I knock on the door, there's no answer.  Ben comes to the front and walks right into the door.  Then Anakin is standing there, but he's not important any more.  I begin to take off some of the heavy layers in my uniform, seeing how it's too hard to handle in stealth, and pretty soon all that's left of it is just the vest, now I'm dressed mostly like Master Iruka from Naruto.    I go inside, to see it looks just like my old school STMA in the office complext.  There's a computer at the front with an old man there, some women in the corner where the chapel should be, and his dad in the far corner where the ramp would be, surrounded by those wall partitions and sitting in front of a computer.  There's a couch on the left side of the room, and I go sit on it.  Some of Ben's brothers (well, not necessarily BROTHERS, more like little kids) invite me to play Super Smash Brothers Melee, and I play as Marth for a fight.  I don't see how it turns out, because they all leave to play N64.  I play a while by myself as Marth against some Alligator guy in Yoshi's level, surprised at how much they haven't played the game because I see a bunch of weird names and characters describing their levels and play time.  Hmm.  I look over and I see Ben's dad working, and I generally look around the room for a while.  There are several differences, like instead of the "front office" (the school was in an office complex, there wasn't an official one) there was a large window.  There also seems to be a "meanwhile, at such and such place" scene.  Some guy who's weirdly dressed is talking to a bunch of followers, saying that some army is going to be there before them, and they will definately lose the battle.  ***What I think***  At first I didn't remember this dream, only that part in Kakariko village, then as I wrote it, remembered the sneaking around part, then I remembered the desert part.  The Kakariko Village part is from me playing Zelda too much lately.  I'm not sure about everything else though... maybe the strangeness of my inner self?

      I stand up, ready to "cut her head off" with my bokken with a horizontal cut, but then I back down, I don't hold a good position, so I shouldn't attack.  The others, however, all charge her.  She runs off into a all, and I follow.  We head into this room, but two people walk out of it past us: some blindfolded kid, and a slightly older bodyguard in a white uniform.  By body guard, I mean martial artist.  Both of them have shaved heads, like Chinese monks.  They walk out, when I shout, "the kid is that lady!" well, I pretty much only think that, but the others seem to realize it also.  We run into the previous room, and now the  house is completed, and there are many people there.  Sitting in the window sill is that kid, but it isn't a woman, it's some Chinese boy about 12 years old, he seems to be meditating, and tells his bodyguard something.  The body guard jumps at me, and just as I raise my bokken up to defend, the others jump up on that guy and take him down.  Now, I go to attack the other kid.  I shout something, but he doesn't respond.  Then I start hitting him in the head with my bokken, but he doesn't seem to be responding to it at all.  Whenever I hit, little flashes of light come up like in a video game, namely the Legend of Zelda.  Soon the bodyguard comes back, and strikes, I knock it out of the way, my bokken seems to be gone for a moment as I fight a hand to hand battle.  I go for his neck, but he bends down and blocks with his left hand.  I knee for his back, now open to me, but he raises his right leg behind him to block.  We both push away, and I have my bokken back.  He lunges foward again, I deflect with my bokken, and go for the head, but he just grabs the tip of the sword, throwing it away with enough force to send me spinning also.  I just go along with the push, turning around and I smack him in the face.    Now I'm at the front of the room, and people are talking.  They seem to be the family of this Chinese guy (like the Tao family from Shaman King, all those fans who had to bear with that bad American editing... *sob*) who is now grown up, and also seems to be the guy who "gave me a push" into leaving.  They say he's somewhat messed up in the head, and we lead them around the room, telling them about what's been happening.  Then, we mention the basement, so I lead them to where it was located when building (this house is VERY nice, we did a good job I guess) was being built.  It was now covered in wood, and I smacked through it with my bokken, opening a trapdoor.  The black guy and I are standing there, looking down into the "dungeon".  There is one thing there, a table, with some stuff on it (looks like a gambling table??) but draped over it are some blue strings.  The black guy says something about "we can only guess what horrible things those are for."  Then we turn to go back to the main room.  The family is apparently looking for their parents, who that Chinese guy kidnapped and imprisoned because he was mad.  There was a box with nothing but windows and a door, with a wooden frame.  Some guy is using a knife to carve some Chinese characters in the wall (but they look Japanese to me).  And it is now unlocked.  Another guy says "can I do the most important part?" (he is also a bit messed up in the head it seems) and he pushes open the door.  Out comes the guy from my work in the first part of the dream, wearing a black tank top and black jeans.  Then some woman comes out, but I only see half of her (my view is now like a tv screen) before it goes somewhere else.    Something now happens, but I forget it.  Maybe NOTHING happens at times like this?  I just think it does.  Oh well.  ***What I think***  I think, besides delving deep into my inner personality, it shows how I HATE TO BE DRAFTED FOR "volunteer work".  It happens all the time.  Stuff liket his: Mom: "let's go!" Me: "Where?" Mom: "To Raleigh Latin" Me: "why?" Mom: "So we can help clean up."  Yeah, stuff like that.

      The scene changes to one on the beach.  Everyone is there, but hanging around by this black SUV that's on the beach, standing in the waves.  I talk to several people, and a huge cliff appears, but it disappears after a while.  We hang around there, until the waves stop.  Some lady comes up, she's dressed like some girl scout leader.  She asks several of us to come along with her.  We go along, off the beach.  As we pass, the waves stop, and the sky which we thought was huge, was really a fake wall, like in a movie set.   Now we're in front of this house, or at least the foundations of it.  I'm now lying on the floor, while this lady is handing out tools to everyone, apparently we're doing "volunteer work".  So we begin to build the house when the lady comes in with a bunch of cookies, and their the girl scout ones.  We ask how much, and she says they are $9.  We ask for what, and she says a box.  We get pretty mad at those prices (The others and I) then she starts going BERSERK!  And yells at us to get back to work.  Pretty soon, we're all dirty, and working, when one of the black people (reminds me of the one from the factory earlier, in personality anyways) jumps over the building in progress and into the forest.  This forest looks like the one by my uncles house.  He begins to run, and the lady goes nutso.  I look down, the house is on a hill, and I see that same lady in a black dress, then I look the other way, and the lady is dressed as a girlscout leader again.  I then notice the lady in the black dress goes into the woods after the guy, but the trees aren't so thick we can't see them.  Someone says about the black guy "he's wearing flip flops" so I guess we're barefoot?  I couldn't really feel it.  I turn around, and the black person is back again.  We continue this work for a long time, and instead of seeing things actually built, I turn around and a new wall is up.  Such things like that happen all the time.  The black guy is now working on what seems like a basement, but there's no way out of it, it's just a large rectangular pit, apparently so he can't escape.  Soon we get very angry, and we're all standing on a huge pile of mud, but the mud is grey, it might not be mud at all, but it's wet, and we're standing in it up to our knees.  We are yelling at her, someone says "we should have gone home a week ago" this is some sort of summer camp, because then some girl says "yeah, we're going to get in trouble." I realize I now hold my bokken in a ready-to-draw position, and I slowly inch it out of my imaginary saya. *see part 3*

      Okay, this dream is very interesting, and long.  Before the dream actually "starts" (but this is still part of it) I'm leaving for work, and I think I'm kissing my wife goodbye.  After waking up I forget most of the detail, but I am apparently very rich, and live in a very nice house.  Then I start to drive to work (very fun).  I start at what seems like a nuclear power plant, a very advanced one.  Lots of blue glowy things, and blue electricity, and the room is dark, so the blue power is even brighter.  There are many machines there, but what's even weirder is, the actual building is that of my old house in OK.  Well, there's a small explosion, and it's after that when I begin to think about leaving.  Another person comes out of the room, he's white, and pretty muscular.  We begin to talk in the hallways about leaving.  He says "okay, let's go." and I respond "wait, I need to work, I have a family, I need to support them!" but he walks back, and just yells at whoever is in the room saying "Roland and me are leaving".  So then we go out into the garage of my old house/power plant, and my car is there, but it's somewhat... shrunk, to that of a go-cart.  The next thing I know, I am driving backwards, with anothe care driving fowards right into me.  Well, we quickly spin around (the car is a two seater, one in front of the other so it's longer than it is wide) and find we are on a go-cart race track.  Lots of other people from school (I am now apparently younger) are in the crowd, which is small and practially standing in the narror racetrack.  (by narrow I mean barely enough for my car as it is).  We race around the track, speeding around tight corners, and blowing the crowd away with our racing, then my "partner" is thrown out of the car apparently, but I continue racing.  Then my car goes out of control, and I am sent flying from it, and the car itself tumbles away.  I, however, continue running on the track, in order to get above the people, I jump on a pole and I swing around in a huge arc over there head.  Then there are a bunch of chairs in the track, and the place begins to change.  There are two seats left: one by a friend and one by a hot girl.  I take the one by the hot girl. *See Part 2*

      There is a first part to my dream, I know there is.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember it, I'll just start from what I do remember.  I'm lying on my bed in my room upstairs, it is about 8:15 (judging from the amount of light coming through my window) playing on my regular GBA, at least, that's what I felt in my hands.  I look around the room, and I'm talking to someone, I don't know what I'm saying, and I can't exactly see the person.  Whenever I glimpse them from the corner of my eye, the their disappear.    Next, I am sitting at the kitchen table, with my back to the window.  The blinds are up, and the sun is reflecting off the candle stands and a sharp glare is coming into my eyes from my brother's math book.  I look down at the newspaper, the green title shows it's the Money Section.  On the right side of the paper, I see a bunch of numbers written vertically.  I look at the number to the furthest left, and it starts with a five (or maybe a six), but there are six sets of three numbers (like thousands places, but six) over trillions I would guess.  Looking to the left and slightly above these numbers is a picture of a woman, looks like she's been in jail, but apparently was released.  I read the caption, and I don't think I ever saw the words, but I thought that she killed her kids (or something bad like that).  I'm now in my living room, the blinds are closed, so it's dark, but still morning.  I'm leaning over the couch playing on my SP (with the light on) when all of a sudden, I get a third person view (this had all been first person) when a woman walks into the room.  I'm wearing what I was wearing yesterday, a blue shirt and some green cargo pants.  This third person view is like a video game cutscene.  It is first person again, and I'm looking at my SP, but the light is so bright I can't see what's on the screen.  I then look at the woman who walked in, IT WAS THE LADY FROM THE NEWSPAPER!  AAAHHHHHHH!!!!  She says something, don't remember what, nasty tone and a nasty look on her face too.   Next, I'm in my living room again, but it's nighttime, and I'm watching tv.  My mom is also in the room, lying down, but she's flickering.  One moment she's on the couch, but when I turn and look another direction, she's lying across the room.  Then sometimes, she's not there at all.  I also hear my brother sitting behind me, and from the corner of my eye see my sister sitting on the chair across the room.  Well, the tv is lighting up the room a bit, and I can actually see it.  It's advertising a new CD and the picture has lots of colors.  On the bottom right of the screen there are songtitles, apparently from that CD.  Mom mentions some song called "Rain 2".  I think a song called Rain (or something like that) was made by Hillary Duff.  Mom asks me if the song is any good (because I listen to the radio the most, so apparently I would know), and I tell her that it is.  There might be something after that, but I don't remember.  ***What I think***  The other night, before bed, I dusted off my GBA and played some FE (fire emblem) so apparently that was a memory of that, except it was more along the lines of one o'clock in the morning.  The numbers on the newspaper were obviously supposed to be Japanese writing.  But since I don't know enough to make sentences, it just makes numbers.  Because at a glance, the writing in my Japanese reading exercise almost does look like numbers.  When I eat, I often look at any old newspaper that's lying around, and I see everything from articles on Latin to movie reviews.  So apparently my mind decided to make some lady who killed her kids, and who then shows up at my house!  Sometimes I wonder what really happens up there.  Anyway, her coming MIGHT represent my Aunt Kristine coming up here from Texas... but as far as I know she never killed her kids.  Maybe a link to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?  The last part in the living room is a typical moment when we watch a movie or just television together.  Everyone was sitting in their usual spots, mom's either on the couch or the floor next to dad, sister on the thair, my brother and I somewhere else, either sitting on the floor or on the couch.  And the Hillary Duff song?  I might have heard it last night, because I sometimes turn on the radio before going to bed, but then turn it off when I'm ready to actually sleep.

      Well, this dream was a bit odd.  I'm sitting in this huge stadium, and it is HUGE, I'm only halfway up, but the field is only a small dot.  The stadium is full, and I get up to go walk around.  I see several people from Stoffer's party (see other blog), and I begin to recruit them for swordsmanship.  They follow me, and we leave the stadium by a super-fast train at the top.  Instantly we begin to walk out of an elevator (don't know how we got in), and I notice some of the people are different than the ones I recruited, I'm now "with the wrong crowd".    We go into this room and start talking, when another guy comes in, he looks 19, and he's basically a punk off the street, another person is with him, and the street guy is beating the crap out of the other guy.  At first we try to ignore him and keep talking, but we can't help but look at the beating.  The street guy tells the people with me (there are five currently with me) to do something, one after another, like to help beat the other guy up and join his gang.  At first they are hesitent, then he tells them HE can beat the crap out of them, and the quickly do what he says.  He gives them commands one at a time, me last.  He almost seems to ignore me, as I don't recall having a command.    I just leave (I feel like I've been holding a shinai or a bokken, like for practice this whole time) down the elevator, and I'm on the top row of that stadium, talking to someone but my mom is nearby, I might be talking to her.  I say "they weren't who I was looking for."  ***What I think of it***  Well, some of the people at Stoffer's party were going to RLHS next year, and I really want to see if I can form a kendo team, so I seem to be recruiting for that.  I don't know why all of a sudden the five people from Stoffer's party change to total strangers, but they are extremely detailed people, like I've met them all before... we basically talk about martail arts while watching that beating, but when they leave, I also feel like I'm wearing the kendo uniform, along with holding the shinai.  When I say "they weren't who I was looking for" I was obviously referring to those people in the room, but maybe I was also referring to the people at RLHS, like they don't seem like they want to be in kendo.  The people in the room after the elevator might be older versions of the people from RLHS (they all looked around 19), showing that in the long run they won't stick with kendo, so I leave the room.  Maybe my recruitment will continue in another dream.

      Well, I have been having some very interesting dreams over the past few days, but due to the current circumstances (see other blog) I haven't been posting.  My dreams have been varied and have been many, but all I'm going to say about is: they were lucid.  For those who don't know, lucid is a state of your dreams where you control what's going on.  Now, my lucid dreams are a bit different than normal, and here's why.    When you are lucid, people tell you to do extraordinary things, like fly, for example.  When I'm lucid, I act as if I am in a 3D RPG game.  I look around, see the people there, and act out my current roll.  Sometimes, I'm walking around the castle, in those instances, I whip out my sword, and begin to run around, find some enemies, cut them down, and continue one.  When I meet the "boss" of this said castle, I begin to fight him with my ultra-cool kick ass katana.  The only thing is, I stretch my abilities in that.  I do extremely long air combos, like the ones from Kingdom Hearts.    Anyway, I'll explain more of my situation my other blog, and I'll try to update these more often.

      I'm standing in this large room, it looks like the new STMA (some school that I used to go to) except I am surrounded by fellow RLHS people.  Some of the people there were: Tiffany, Erin, Annie, Ben, and for some strange reason, Baggett, along with me of course.  Anyway, Stoffer's dad comes in, because apparently Stoffer is there too, and tells us we should get going.  We all pile into MY van, and ride around somewhere, but the dream skips to our return.  We walk into the STMA building, and it's changed.  It has water in it, like it's some sort of building/dock.  We all get into a Lego ship, and we all turn into lego people.  Now we are Lego Pirates.  I think we sail around, with a couple of cutscenes, then we land on this island and do something unimportant.  There's a traitor in our midst, and I think he tries to kill me (seems I'm the captain) but we stop him, and throw him below.  Standing in front of him is a Lego Jango Fett from star wars, and he's calibrating something below the ship, like a mix of worlds.  The traitor tries to kill Jango while Jango's back is turned, but Jango stops him, and the traitor says, "I know how you can see me even though your back is turned".  Now they're in what seems like New York City, they're in the middle of the road, but it seems they cut a chunk out of the road, because they're below the road's surface, almost like a sewer system, and Jango is standing there calibrating the same thing, looks like a small control panel.  The traitor pulls out a gun, and time seems to slow a little bit.  He raises the gun, when Jango finishes.  My voice comes in and says "Jango, activate it now".  Just after saying that, the traitor shoots at Jango, who flies up with his rocket pack.  It turns out the traitor's weapon is a multi-flare gun, many red flares shoot up at him, but he flies away, just as a huge bomb explodes.  When I said huge, I meant HUGE.  This blast started ripping through buildings, from a cut scene type thing.  It seemed like that dramatic/sad music is playing like in a movie where something bad happens.  The scene goes to one building, then through the windows you can see the blast, and it rips through the building toward the viewer.  Then another scene is from the side, it shows a building, and another part of the blast rips through the left side of it, and comes through the right.  This is a huge wall of a blast, three times bigger than any of the buildings.  During this time I think about how I killed that traitor.  Next is a scene from space, looking down on Earth, in the western hemisphere, or for some simpler directions, the United States part.  It shows the blast originating from New York, and it explodes, spreading all over the United States, there's not much of a shockwave, it stays pretty close to the wall of fire, soon the blast reaches South America, but it stops halfway down.    Next is my perspective, I'm a human again, plain old me.  Running from this blast with my family.  My dad was absent though.  The only thing was my aunt from Texas and her kids, a son and daughter (my cousins) were with us.  We were running and it seemed like we were in a Super Wal-Mart.  The blast stopped inches away from us, as we had our back pressed against one of the shelves in an isle, I forget what products were in our isle.  Soon the wall of fire goes slowly away, and we are safe.  The family starts saying things like "thank God" or "I'm glad we made it" and stuff like that, I can't remember exactly, I however, go exploring.  Namely to the other side of our isle, to see none other than: candy.  Oreo snack bites, chocolate, caramel, caramel with stuff in the middle, and other assorted favorites like that.  I think about taking some of the caramel, just opening up the bag and eating some, because I remind myself I don't have braces anymore, so I can eat them.  Then I look over down the isle, opposite it is the bathrooms, and the pharmacy or something.    There's a line in the sky which separates the blast zone from the Wal-Mart, I can see it curve around, so it looks like it was a small blast.  Nobody is in sight, but I stop, and don't take any, then I see my sister standing there.  She looks like she's standing there like those freaky kids in horror movies but I don't notice a bit.  I leave, and it seems like we pile into our van again, but mom isn't there.  My Aunt is driving, and she says something along the lines of "maybe we'll find her tomorrow" because it's dark, and the place is pretty "creepy".  I for one don't mind, but I'm not driving.  I then ask if we will have any deformaties after the exposure to radiation.  Then I say, "if I wake up and have any super powers-" then it gets cut off.  The scene seems to freeze, as I wake up.

      Devon used to be a fairly athletic guy, always running around, doing sports. He wasn't the best, but, he definitely wasn't the worst. But in time, he matured and became somewhat of a nerd. He was always on his computer, his brother gave it to him once he moved out and got a better one, so it wasn't a great computer. His friends, few friends, described it as 'ancient.' His life wasn't all that boring until one day...so he thought.  Devon was at his little computer, typing away for a research project for his college history class. He was writing a 10 page essay over the Revolutionary War. It was due tomorrow  and he was only on the 7th page. To make matters worse, he was really stressing out and when he looked at the clock it read: 2:16 AM.  "Crap, why did I wait so long to do this! Prof. Neits assigned it a week ago, and I blew it off until three days before." He sighed. He finished the sentence he was typing and leaned back in his comfy chair, his only escape from the major pressure, with his arms behind his head. The screen flashed black then a greenish blue screen popped up.   "Oh my God! What happened to my report!!" he screamed as he slapped the computer hoping it might help.  It flashed white then blue again and typed out the message:  "m-th-r k-dn-pp-d. -ddr-ss = time, r-ck p-th."  "What is that supposed to mean? It's in some sort of code, or something...Wait a minute, there aren't any vowels! Except in time. I wonder why.." Devon questioned. "Hmm...maybe the dashes took place of certain vowels?? M-_-T-H-_-R..Hmmm, M-A, nah. M-E? nope...M-I!...no..M-O! M-O-T-H-E-R...Mother?! What about her!!" He screamed, as if it were a living person.  Devon spent hours, it seemed, trying to crack the rest of the message. So far he had Mother kidnapped. Address = time rock path. He still was unsure what the time was for. Eventually, the remembered it was 2:16 when this message came up.  "216 Rock Path? That's not an address anywhere near here." wondered Devon. "What addresses do I know of that have a 216 in their address.."  After about 10 minutes of thinking, he finally had it.  "216 Rock Path stands for 216 Stoney Road! It's only a few blocks from here!" he shouted "But why would my mom be at the library? Oh well, I better go look for her."  For some unknown reason, he got up, tossed his bag over his shoulder, and headed out the door.  "What the-!" exclaimed Devon as he peered around outside. It was daylight. "How is this possible?! My computer said 2:16!"  He decided it didn't matter seeing as he had to get to his mother's aid. Then, he realized that his mom was here, in New York. When she lived in Kansas.  "Wait a minute. How can she be here?" asked Devon, as if there was some all-knowing guru right next to him. "No time though, I must get to her."  He trekked on and eventually reached the library. It seemed to be standing unusually taller than normal but he ignored it.  "216 Stoney Road. This is it" he said. As he walked into the library.   There was a spiral staircase. He walked up to it, looked upwards, only to see it going up very high. Too high He saw the ceiling and figured his mother might be there seeing as she wasn't on the first floor. He started hiking up the staircase getting nearer to the ceiling, and to his mom. He was looking up the whole time but, when he looked down, he appeared to be on the third step still. This threw his equilibruim off and he stumbled. But, the ceiling wasn't any further away than when it was a second ago. He got up and started up the stairs once again. After hours, it seemed, he finally go to the top. He peered over the edge of the floor and saw his mother tied to a chair at the end of a hallway of bookcases. He hurried up the rest of the way and dashed to his mother. As he neared her, her heard her screaming something.  "G-- -p!!! W-k- u- D---n!!" she screamed.  Slowly, the message became clear. She was screaming 'Get up! Wake up Devon!' Devon, realizing he was in a dream, he suddenly awoke to find himself in his room. But, it wasn't his room as it had been in the dream. Not his sheetless bed, cluttered desk and shelves. But, it was his twin bed, with dinosaur sheets and pillow, his rug with a street and town imprinted on it. The rug had toys scattered everywhere on it.  "Devon! Get up! It's time for school!!"

      "LANCE! WAKE UP! NOW!!" A large man with a deep voice was banging on the door to Lance's bedroom.  It was six o'clock in the morning, and Lance rolled over with a sigh.  He opened his eyes to look at his clock.  "Ugh, I hate this... especially on a Monday..." he shut his eyes and went back to sleep.    Twenty minutes later Lance's father came into the room, dressed for work in a black business suit and a tie.  "Lance," he started "It looks like I'll have to get you out of bed again." he walked over to the side of the bed and pulled back Lance's warm covers.  Lance's legs shot up to his chest the moment the cold morning air touched him; he shivered a little.  His dad then lifted the matress off on one side, sending Lance rolling over onto the floor with a thud.  "DAD! I told you not to do that anymore!" he said, shooting up.  His dad replied with a small devlish smile on his face, "maybe next time I should pour cold water on your head instead?"  Lance shouted back "NO!  Come on dad, I'm never late for school." "Only because I get you up." his dad replied.  Two minutes later they left the house, Lance was chewing on a cereal bar and trying to flatten his messy brown hair which he had no time to comb.  "Got everything?" his dad asked.  "Yeah, everything except a good night's sleep." Lance said with a small yawn.  He saw his dad get into his car and drive off to work.  Lance lived in a small community just outside of the city, so his house just across the street from school.    In Twenty minutes the first period bell rang.  Lance was practially falling asleep, he stayed up too late doing homework, only because he chatted over AIM too long.  His dad didn't get home until very late, so it's not like his dad would really care on the way home from work.  First period was Geometry, and he wondered why this class had to be first period of the day.  "Class." a blonde haired teacher addresed the class, "pull out your homework.  Problems 1-65 please." Lance's heart sank... he didn't do his homework!  "Oh, what am I going to tell hi-" he stopped mid-thought, walking across the room, her blonde hair flowing in the air behind her, was Alexa. She walked past the window which overlooked the flowers in front of the school, her glowing blue eyes flashed in Lance's direction, and for a moment, both eyes met, and the-  "Looking at the beauty of God's work, Lance?" the teacher asked. "Uh, y-y-yes, sir.  I mean, no sir, I mean-" Lance replied, wondered if the teacher saw him looking at Alexa. The teacher replied sarcastically "I know how beautiful the flowers in the garden are, but please try and pay attention.  Now, you're homework?"  The last bell rang, and Lance picked up his bag and headed for his locker. Behind him walked Alexa and some of her friends.  He wondered if he'd ever get to make a move, she was always hanging around with her friends, and it's not like he could just pull up in some nice expensive car and drive away alone with her, impressing both Alexa and her friends.  He headed outside, going home, but stopped at a tree to think.  After banging his head against the tree several times, he saw Alexa come out for tennis practice.  Several rounds went by, when all of a sudden a voice popped up from behind Lance.  "Painful, isn't it.  You're whole world standing just beyond that fence, just out of reach."  Lance seemed not to notice too much "it's only a fence..." he replied back.  The guy behind him answered that, "a very big fence, can't have stray tennis balls flying out... or flying in for that matter."  "No.. we wouldn't want tha-  HEY!" Lance jumped back.  Standing behind him was a shrimpy kid with red hair and brown eyes, he was obviously a freshman.  "What are you sneaking up on people for?"  After several minutes of talking, Lance really only found out the guys name was Mike, and he skipped all of middle school because of his intelligence, but knew how he could help Lance get Alexa.  "Um, but if you skipped all of middle school... wouldn't that mean, you know... you're a nerd?  And uh, incapeable of getting a date?"  Mike looked stunned, "well, if you don't want my help, you're doing a greeeeaaat job already with getting your date.  So I'll be out of your way."  as Mike walked away, Lance realized how good off he WASN'T in getting Alexa.    The next day after school, Lance was in his position.  Mike had reset the electronic message board in front of the school to read "ALEXA, I LOVE YOU", and then Mike would set off some fireworks or something.  Lance could care less about fireworks, he just wanted the message to be seen.  Alexa would soon come out from tennis practice, but one of the last ones to leave so all of her friends wouldn't be there.  He waited, and waited, and waited.  Until at last, after what seemed like an hour (but was really only five minutes) Lance got up the courage to go find her himself.  He walked around the corner, only to see Alexa making out with some other guy!  How could this happen?!   Lance quickly tured around and headed home.  Moments later he heard the fireworks go off, so he suspected that Mike sent them off, and also wondered if he turned on the sign.  If Mike DID turn on the sign, it was probably in the other guy's favor.  He gave a big sigh as he fell backwards onto his bead.  "Oh well, life moves on I guess." he said to himself.  "but I really did like her..."

      "Dimitri! Wake up!" yelled Drew, one of Dimitri's crew buddies.  "Huh? Aaaaaah!" screamed Dimitri, still thinking he was falling toward the deep turquoise waters of the ocean.   "Whoah buddy, calm down, you are safe inside the ship on a nice cot now, don't worry" reassured Winters.   "Ouch! Ughh...what h-happened? Where am i-I?" mumbled Dimitri as he flinched the moment he felt a shock of pain run through his battered leg.  "You were hanging on the anchor after being hit by that cannon ball. You fainted, but, you still hung on. You saved my life." said Winters. Dimitri noticed the faintest trace of sympathy within his gaze. "Thank you. And, thank God we managed to get you up. Drew here had to go down there with a rope around his waist. He carried you up to safety!"   "Heh, th-thanks Drew. But, d-did we win the battle?" said Dimitri, shivering from loss of blood.  "Yes we did. It was a close one though. They got us pretty badly. I have some of the crew working on those dents below deck. It's a good thing we built her sturdy!" chuckled Winters.  As Dimitri looked around the room from the soft cot they had lain him on, he saw Drew, Winters and a few other crew mates he sometimes talked to including Jake, Gavin, and Hector. He started to smile, knowing that all these people were here because they cared for him, just as everything started spinning and became fuzzy, he blacked out yet again.  His peaceful sleep was broken by another dream. It started just as the other one ended.   It was a trap...

         Dimitri hung from the anchor hole as best he could, the shock still held him in its numbing grip. He could see Cptn. Winters yelling, but the noise was shier void, as if audio has seized. Dimitri held fast for a time into the battle, but has only the strength of a man, and finally his grip faltered, and he plunged into the turquoise water.      The following few minutes were a total blur of blue and white foam, but by a godsend chance, he ended up on a plank, 100 or more yards out, it was all he could do to hold to the board as he drifted farther, and again, passed into darkness...     Again awaken, this time, to the lumbering shadow of a Royal Battle Ship. Then he noticed a life raft headed in his direction, with fully armored gaurdsmen ready to escourt him to the abyss. He made a feble attempt to flee, but it was only an aimless paddle outward, and he soon stood before the Admiral of the Royal Navy Fleet.     It was a trap...

      His happy thought was soon interrupted by a loud *CRACK*. Across the room, there was a large, splintered dent in the hull of the ship. He jumped, dropping Wesley to the floor. Wesley hurriedly scurried off to his same little cove in the flour, but, Dimitri had nowhere to go.  "We are surrounded!" said a crew member, shortly followed my another loud crack directly behind Dimitri. He was thrown forward by the sheer force of the blow to the hull. Dimitri decided to run up on deck to see what the heck was happening.  When he saw Winters standing there, calm and fierce, at the same time, he too was clam for a second. A very short second. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge steel ball flying through the air straight for the captain's back.  "CAPTAIN! WATCH OUT!" scream Dimitri as he dove to protect the captain. The ball thankfully misses Winters, but, Dimitri wasn't so lucky. The cannon ball had bashed his right leg from the knee down to no return. It's force carried Dimitri, away from the captain toward the edge of the deck. He fell down the side of the ship. The captain was sure, he would never see that young, intellegent Dimitri again.  He slowly walked to the edge of the ship to see the fate of his young hero. Everything around him seemed to go in slow motion as he peered over the edge to see young Dimitri hanging from the anchor hole.

      He walked carefully accross the slightly flour covered floor, taking special care of where he placed each foot. Upon reaching the wall he slid down onto the floor, his knees bent into his stomach. He surveyed the floor around him, looking for something. His face lit up at the sight of his partner. A large fat, grey haired rat, was laying, almost squished, between two bags of flour. Dimitri greeted his furry companion, and gave him a little scratch on the nose. "Hello there, Wesley." The rat instantly began grinding it's teeth, making the clicking noise all rats make when overjoyed.  Dimitri reached into his vest pocket, and pulled out a shimmering gold coin. The rat's eyes burst with joy at the sight of it. It began scraping away at the floor with it's paws, slowly, but surely pulling itself out of it's little cave. (How it got in there in the first place, is another mystery of the universe.) Then, like a bullet out of a rifle, Wesley the Rat came rocketing out of his hole. His head slammed into Dimitri's outstreched hand, and bounced back. Taking a second to regain his thoughts, he than grabbed the coin in his paws, gave it a snif, and than a bite. He looked up once more at Dimitri's face, to show his gratification, and scampered off, down a hole in the floor.   Wesley returned from his home in the floor, skipping greetings and immediatley searching Dimitri's hands for another shiny prize. Dimitri handed about 20 coins to the large greedy rat, untill he came back to an empty hand. Dimitri patted him on the head, and scratched him behind the ears, and said, "Don't worry Wes, I'll bring you more another day."  Dimitri had been practicing this ritual for quite awhile now. He's probably stored atleast 300 coins down there. Dimitri smiled to himself. He picked up Wesley and cradled him in his arms, tickling his white belly.   From above, a loud commotion broke out. Dimitri sat nervously, petting the rat to sooth his fear. He'd been through this many times, but it always worried him. The panic in his mind has calmed down a little since his first time in an attack, but never completely. To erase the fear completely would be to erase the human in him, it is impossible. The yelling got louder, Dimitri became more uneasy. He imagined the fight taking place above him. He saw the enemy ship, 4 times as large as his own. He saw a cannonball lodge itself in the side of the ship, and the entire room filling with water. He then saw Captian Winters, fighting to his very last breath, and suddenly, remarkably, most of his worry was soothed. He pictured him and Winters, fighting together, side by side. He smiled to himself again, and waited.

      After seeing the captain's steady gaze, he calmly went back to his room to read. He was reading a very good book. It was an action scene, much like the one he was experiencing at this very moment. The only variation was that it wasn't between two pirate vessels. It was between two small countries a ways south and east of where they were. It was a fiction book so, it never  really  happened. But, it was really interesting. So interesting, he didn't even notice the captain standing in the doorway, giving him that same, comforting, yet forceful green stare.  "We are approaching the enemy ship." explained Winters. "We are just out of firing range so I need you to take cover below deck, on the starboard side."  "Yes sir." said Dimitri as he snapped his book shut and stood up straight.  The captain then turned on his heel, and walked, almost marching, down below deck with Dimitri following. Once below the upper deck, Dimitri once again saw this familiar place. Barrels of ale, bags of curry and flower. There was a different arrangement in the corner with some flower bags. One could tell that Dimitri has been here before and these small battles are no new thing. Little did he know, this was not any ordinary 'small battle.'

      It still amazed Dimitri how organized the crew was. Drunken fools only hours before, they now worked with an ease and grace like no other. Another mystery of the universe, thought Dimitri. Perhaps though, it wasn't all that much of a mystery at all. Dimitri glanced at the captian, and they caught eachothers eyes, and for a split second, Dimitri knew exactly why the Pirates worked so well. The sharp green eyes smiled at Dimitri, and seemed to tell him, "Everything will be alright."

         "Sir! You must awaken! The pirateship Sailbeam has been spotted only half a mile out!" Fumbiling about for his trousers and coat, the news is delivered quickly. "The Captain requests your prescence on the bridge, sir!" Out of the cabin, it was utter pandamonium, men hurried for their cloths and ran to their battle stations, some half nude.    Once on the bridge, he realized that only half the officers were in uniform. "How long till were in range?" asked Captain Winters. "Twenty minuets, if the winds hold", said the navigator  "What are we up against?", the Captain asked  "Armorment unknown," said the weapons specalist," but our range isn't enough to strike first" Dimitri sighed, this was the kind of thing right out of the text book, but he still worried. Would this day end for him at the bottom of the sea?

      In the warm lamplight Dimitri fumbled dizzily around the swaying, creaking, snoring room. Dimly lit all around him were the faces and beards of stinky old men, half asleep, half unconcious. The smell of ale wafted steadily in front of Dimitri's nose, poisoning his every breath. He carefully made his way through a maze of bodies, trying hard not to step on anyone, and then halted in the corner, shining his lamp on a large chest nested next to the wall, bolted to the floor. He exhales, sending dust in swirling patterns in front of his eyes. His attention is temporarily lost in the swirling patterns of light rays through dust. Quickly he snaps back into reality, and reaches into his pocket. His hand emerges from the pocket of his sleeveless white vest, revealing a rather large, rusty key. Hey presses the key into it's rightful hole on the chest, and turns it. Quickly but carefully he opens the large metal framed lid of the chest, and the light from his lamp is reflected back at him, from thousands of golden coins. Hastily, he shuffles a couple handfuls of coins into a small bag, closes the lid, locks the chest, and creeps back through the maze of smelly old men. He climbs up a ladder, breathes a sigh of releif, and retreats to his cabin.   The creaking of the ship continues steadily as Dimitri lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling of his private room. He closes his eyes and has a short moment of peace. Sadly to be soon interupted by tomorrow's duties.

      Hi, my name is Travis and my other blog is  urlLink here.   I hope that this group story blog will turn out well and I will do my best to contribute. I am not much of a writer. But, I think it will be fun to practice writing, especially for school. I want to develop my writing skills, not because I want to be a writer, but, because they need developing. :)  -Travis-

      And with his mighty hand, Buddy created A bowl, and in this bowl, letters and tomato soup. Then with a grace like no other, Buddy called forth the soup crafters, who formed the letters into sentences, and then into paragraphs, and finally into stories.   This will hopefully be a fun group blog in which those who wish to join, and have decent writing ability, can come together to create collaborated stories. Eh, I give it a couple weeks before we give up on it.  So, we'll start a new story every month, and maybe take a break for short one member stories, weekly stories, and any other new interesting things we can think of.  I'll begin by inviting some friends to come join in on the fun. Then we'll attempt to start some sort of story out of our little brains.

      Well I had one of those Yogurt fruit at the bottom things, and when I started to stir it up and stuff, there was no fruit at the bottom.  It was strawberry, and there's never any of that at the bottom anyway, but when you start to stir up blueberry, it's so blue it's black.  Oh well.  I was talking to a friend of mine by the name of Annie, and she told me that she had heard God made man first as a blueprint, then made women as an improvement to all the flaws.  Well, I suppose all that talk about men being superior to women back in the days of fuedal society (even up until recently, relatively speaking) was crap.  And I suppose that's true, considering all the things women can do and men can't do because a woman's center of gravity is different than a man's... oh well, I guess that's life, always having to dig through to the fruit on the bottom, only to find out there isn't any...

      This has happened to me over and over again during the past several days.  I think about something at night, and it is a really good thought that I want to write down here.  Unfortunately, my sister is still in school (year round), and I have to go to bed.  I sit down on the computer, and the awesome thought is... gone.  I don't believe it, it's like I'm wasting all of my thoughts.  Mere shadows are the only remains I have of them... *sigh*   Well, several people have been talking about change recently, so should i talk about it?  Maybe, if I wanted to follow the crowd.  Which I don't want to do at all, unless the crowd is good, which it is, so I'll follow the crowd.  There are two types of change: vuluntary, and involuntary.  Both have happened to me over the years.  First is involuntary.  I lived a happy life in Oklahoma, hanging out w/ Buddy, friends, away from my annoying family, always screwing everything up and finding some fault with me.  *sigh*.    Then, dad loses his job, economy, and we are forced to move.  We were looking for a house, the only problem is, there are no good neighborhoods in VA (where my dad's new job was, and is), so, we decided to move into our grandparents old home in bad old NC.  Everything went downhill.  There were no good schools, but one of the better ones was a so-called elite public school.  It wasn't actually elite, but it was the best option.  So I go there, and the environment is so much... different.  It's not the people were necessarily "mature", more like exposed to more, "mature" things.  Most of 'em were jerks, and I only had several friends, who weren't even friends, more like aquaintances that I could talk to in order to save from boredom.  So I leave, and go to a private Catholic school, that wasn't much different, just throw in mass, and cut the students by a thousand, and there you have it.  Still surrounded by that stupid rap "music", which isn't even music.  Then, I didn't like rap, but now, after be surrounded by it, I was affected less and less and less.  Until one day, I got up, and actually wanted to listen to it.  At first, I couldn't believe it, and tried to drop it, but I couldn't, and the aquired taste in rap still haunts me today.    I grew up very fast in those two years, and sometimes I wish it never happened, but now I'm glad it happened, looking back.  It shaped me into the person I am today, and showed me what I hope I will never become.  The second change is voluntary.  You want it to happen, you make it happen.  It just doesn't come to you, like a forced move and a decided public school, you make it happen.  Sometimes the reason are different.  Some want to be cool, other want to get a guy/girl they are love-struck with.  While other's choices are different.  But all that change is the same: they make it happen.  I have down that, started last year, when I was taking a karate class.  There I saw the kendo club practicing, and I instantly wanted to be part of that.  For those of you who don't know, kendo is Japanese swordsmanship, evolved from kenjutu, and is now basically a sport popular in both Japan and the U.S. (just not on the same scale).  Then I hear about a great Japanese swordsman named Miyamoto Musashi, who saught spiritual enlightenment by way of the sword.  I was instantly motivated, inspired.  Going out, I signed up for some trial classes and kendo, sure it was hard, but I knew that it was my calling.  I became a member, and started.  Every Wednesday and Saturday I would come home from practice exhausted, but I was overjoyed with what I was doing, for the first time in two years, it was something I actually wanted to do.  I then heard of two books, The Book of Five Rings (Go Rin No Sho in Japanese I believe) and Musashi, a fictionalized biography.  Then I hear of the movies Samurai and the manga Vagabond (based on his life).  I have yet to see/read most of those, but very soon I will, on my ever-lasting quest to better myself.  I have also started to learn Japanese.  At first I learned the katakana, hiragana, and kanji online, then, I found out a friend's mother studied Japanese in college.  I asked her if she would teach me, and she agreed.  I have been taking Japanese for about two months, and like kendo, it is very hard, and very different from English, but I enjoy learning it, and enjoy expanding my knowledge.  Change is part of life, sometimes it is unwanted, but always needed.  It makes people who they are and can even change the course of other people's lives, making and breaking relationships.  People should always strive to better themselves, usually through change, but should also learn to accept unwanted and involuntary change, though it maybe be hard.

      I'll try not to delete these posts that I make, after all, they are part of my history.  Maybe someday I'll be famous, and someone will find these, and BAM, all over the internet about how much of an atheist I am.  Or maybe this will be a precursor to my fame.  People will say, "I remember when he used to update his blog every five seconds!"  But I think the reason for these long posts is that I got caught up in the excitement of a blog, and getting my thought out there.  Kind of like when a kid gets a new toy.  He plays with it all day, can hardly go to sleep.  Then the next day, forgets about it.  Maybe I should take it slowly, and post things as I think about them, instead of writing articles and stuff, allowing shorter posts.  After all, the shorter the post, the easier it is to think up a title.

      The previous post was on the meaning of life, but how much of it was actually on the meaning of life?  Basically, I just said stuff about creation, and God, then referenced fate, then talked about death.  Basically, I dodged the questions.  Or as my friend would say, I "danced around the bush."  I don't much care for his way of saying it, but whatever floats your boat.  It just occured to me, that perhaps the reason for lengthy posts was because I liked to hear myself talk.  Maybe I should have said, "some say the meaing of life is this, this, and this.  I think, it is this, because of this.  And when talking about life, let's talk about death. blah blah blah"  Maybe I should just rewrite that last post, seeing how it is 3:30 in the morning, I need to fix the blog post time.

      I should probably post this at the start of the post, as posting it somewhere in the middle seems too difficult at this point.  It is a quote given to me from a very intelligent person responding to my "There and Back Again" post.  Here it is.  "Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blind-folded fear."  -- Thomas Jefferson     Probably one of the best quotes I have ever heard in my life (and I don't hear many).  Well, there are two reasons for today's title.  One being the movie, The Meaning of Life, another monty python movie.  Let's just say that I didn't care too much for it after the first twenty minutes.  I had an argumen/discussion with Buddy about judging things too soon.  My case was that you really needed to see/read something all the way through before forming an opinion.  Well, it turns out that in some cases that is not necessarily true, case in point: The Meaning of Life.  Bleh.    However, though I decided to stop watching it after the first hour or so and decided to update my blog, I did pay particular attention to the opening of the movie.  It was talking about life, what's the point, are we God's little joke, just strands of copying DNA, blah blah blah.  I did stop to think about it though.  What IS the meaning of life?  Why are we here?  I think there comes a time in every young writer's life (that would be mine) where he/she must write about the meaning of life, it is an unwritten rule, or maybe it just happens as one matures... I don't know.  I do know that I'm talking about it here and now.  If you don't want to hear what I have to say, or if you are closed to other people's opinions that might be more radical than yours, you are now being warned... LEAVE! (waits calmly as the rich people in the back leave...).  Okay, now we're here.    First off, everyone has their own opinions, religions, etc, thus, everyone's idea of the meaning of life is different from any others.  I'll try not to *bash* any other opinion, and if you feel like I have, I'm sorry, I only wish to point it out.  Now, you can't talk about the meaning of life, without talking a bit about death (well, you could, unless you agree with the yin and yang philosophy, that you can't have one oppostie without the other).  So, life, let' start at the obvious points: religion.  Again, for all of you strict people who stand fast in your religion of choice, you might want to leave.  I can only speak from a Christian reference, as that is the only religion I know about (I'm sorry all of the never heard of it/don't know much about it people in the audience).    The Bible tells us God created the earth, the sky, animals, and finally... humans.  I won't say "man" as the Bible says, because that is sexist, and that sucks.  (I told you it might be a bit radical... didn't I?"  Well, did it say anything about aliens?  Or things other than earth?  No.  And that was all good and fine, until people actually left earth and headed into space, finally realizing that the heavans weren't just a painted picture in the sky which moved, meaning that there is more to the universe than, our little tiny planet.  So, this fits into the topic because, why was the human race the only ones made in the universe?  Or maybe, we AREN'T the only humans.  Maybe somewhere on the other side of time and space, is a world just like ours.  Or maybe we are the only ones who were made, so is our meaning to life just to take over the entire universe?  Or maybe, God did create more things then He's willing to tell us.  (I could go into another long discussion about stuff like that, but I won't, I have enough thunderbolts heading my way as it is...)  Well, back to the bit about taking over the universe, I have ehard some people say that the meaning of life is to achieve destiny.  Would that be human's destiny?  Maybe, maybe not.  But does destiny exist?  (For that bit, refer back to the "There and Back Again" post).  For those Matrix fans out there, the meaning of life is to... (waits for audience to call it out) that's right, the meaning of life is to die.  Dying and the after life (if there is one), is just like the meaning of life, everyone has their own opinion, religion, etc, that contribute to their meaning of life.  This is how death and afterlife were explained in the theology classes at my Catholic school.  When you die, you discard a body, and you go through purgatory (or something like that) clensing your body of sin, because nothing impure can enter heaven.  Well, what is in heaven?  Nothing like you ever experienced.  And, that's just about it... vague huh?  Well, I went to a church service for Easter I believe, and they said that in heaven, you will eternally praise God.  And since you have no body, no need for anything, you don't need to take a bathroom break and never come back (kind of like skipping class, except it's more like skipping a lecture from the principle...).  Well, I'm sorry, but that sounds (at the risk of being blasphemous) a little, uh, overdoing it.  Then, I have heard another opinion from a catholic frind of mine, and he thinks that heaven is perfect, yes, where you can meet all of your loved ones, and enjoy all of the great things in life that you may have missed.  Stuff like having a nice car or something, but you were too poor, so instead you got a go-cart.  Just for fun, I think I'll put my opinion of heaven.  Like one big online forum.  Where everyone is there, great famous people like Miyamoto Musashi, and Julius Caesar.  Where you can sit and converse as much as you like, and then leave to other portions.  You could, like blogger, have your own section of heaven, where you could sit back, and enjoy eternity, maybe even play some life-like role playing video games or soemething.    Well, another thing that would be cool that I'm sure everyone's heard about: reincarnation.  I'm not sure if it's coming back at the next link of the giant food chain or what, but just reincarnation in general.  Like, if I was Miyamoto Musashi in the past, or maybe Tokugawa Ieyasu, or a farmer.  And if so, did I look the same?  Probably not if I really was a Japanese person.  Would I be recognizeable?  Maybe.  So thta would just be recycling of souls and spirits.  You were a bad person?  HA!  You'll get turned into a bug and squished a thousand times over!  Then come back as a person, with a second chance, and this time, your soul would be good.  But while on earth have no recollection of the past until you die.   And there's one other thing I have heard, and I'm not sure if it is any certain religion.  Every soul is part of a giant mass of souls, in a spirit world, and sometimes, we feel the desire to come to earth, and experience emotions, like love, hate, ambition.  Then when we die, we go back up to that mass of spirits.  Our souls have no definite shape, just a general form representing who we are.  Now, to talk about the downside of Christianity afterlife: hell.  Sometimes, hell seems like kind of a waste.  In my theology class we learned that there is no escape from hell, once you're there, you're there for eternity.  Same with heaven.  Do you ever get to return from either?  Apparently not.  So God can keep creating new souls, with individual personalities and features as many times as He wants without making a single double... wow.  But then I wonder, what if heaven and hell can get... too full?  Well, God is perfect, he can make anything happen, so I guess not.  At least with reincarnation, there is always a possibility of having a second chance if you screw up the first one.  Squished a thousand times... hmmm, I suppose it's better than an eternity in hell, with no second chance.    I hope those few that remain (hears a cricket chirp in the back of the room) found this article enlightening.  I'm sorry if anyone feels offended (though I gave several big warnings), or if you think I *bashed* your religion, I'm sorry and please let me know.  There are probably many errors still in this text after it is posted and they'll be fixed whenever I see them.

           Believe it or not, some people have actually read my blog, especially the post before this one.  And one major thing has come up: the length of the post.  I'll try to make this purpose short, as long as another issue doesn't come up.  One person said that I had written a bible, and Buddy (I'll have to link to his blog) said that short=good.  Well, I suppose, but this blog's purpose is somewhat different than last time.  My last blog (which only had three posts, so this is a record for me) was like a journal, with my day and feelings added to it.  Well, this time it's more like my thoughts on particular issues and things.       For instance, if I have a good conversation with someone, then I'll post about the topics discussed and write my feelings about them here.  The first post of the blog (written yesterday) was like a journal entry, but last night I decided to do something different.  So from now on, I'll post about my thoughts, and maybe give you some examples from my day.  Wow, three posts in one day.

           It's here again, summer.  Yes, I know we've all been there before, and it's back again.  But it has also come along with its buddy, summer boredom.  Next week will hopefully not be so boring, as the explosion of martial arts (and hopefully all those books I want too) will liven it up.  But now, and until next week, I and friends shall be bored.  My computer is acting excrutiatingly slow at this moment, so because of the fear of never being able to get back, I will just stay here and post some thoughts, I have many.  Yes, I already posted today, and at first I thought I should only post once, but I have lots of things going through my head that I need to write down.  The first of which being the paragraphs, apparently they won't let you indent, so I'll just have to skip spaces, yes it will take up more space, but oh well.  I know some other blog's pages are already as long as mine, but with more posts, well mine will be even LONGER with LONGER posts, especially skipping a line for a new paragraph.       Well, I still indent, but it doesn't show up.  Oh well, It's still a good habit I guess.  Anyway, I was wondering if my little domain called Shogun's Fortress will ever be great.  If people will ever say on some forum or another, "oh yeah, Musashi posted something about that on his blog" and people will know what that person is talking about.  But how will I get there?  Do I just post it on random message boards?  *is flamed* um, no, I'd be eaten alive for posting garbage.  Or maybe fate has something to do with it?  Maybe someone will get bored, and click on some random blog that will be mine because he/she doesn't know what a shogun is.  He/she might be so bored that they even start at the first post (as after this it will only be three).  So fate might have a hand in it.  But does fate even exist?       I'm Christian, at least from a Christian family, and just got out of a Catholic school, where we learn all about God.  And they say that fate doesn't really exist, that God gives us free will.  Okay, so fate is non-existant, right?  No, because God has a plan, meaning he knows how it'll work out, meaning that he knows you're going to have to choose between cheese and peperoni, and he knows you are going to choose peperoni.  But wait, he never takes away free will, so you could always choose cheese, and break fate.  But WAIT!  He knows you're going to do that, thus you are still under the command of fate.        But sometimes, I wonder if there is a God.  OH NO, I'm a Christian that is questioning the existance of God?  I'm going to hell... well we already knew that, and if you didn't, now you do.  But, how can you NOT question the existance of God?  You never actually see Him, so let's think about it.  I wouldn't want to disobey my dad because I know he won't like that, besides, I see him every day, he's my father, I don't want to disappoint him.  But, I don't really see God everyday, I pray, but do I actually HEAR Him reply?  I haven't.       And I know there's someone out there who is just now leaving my blog, saying that I'm some pagan dude, who just doesn't care about God.  Well, I know someone who questions God, I know several people, sometimes it's just something to do in this summer boredom (that and go to the pool), but sometimes it's a serious discussion.  But he's a good person.  While I'm on the topic of "being basically a good person", let me tell you about this book.       While I was at that particular Catholic School, we were reading a book, We're on a Mission From God, and it was saying stuff about if you don't go to church every Sunday, and pray every day, morning and night, then you aren't good enough to get into heaven.  So I say to myself, "well, I'm basically a good person."  Then do you know what the book turns around and says?  I'll give you some time to figure it out................  the book says, "and if you think you're 'basically a good person', it's STILL not good enough, you can't just be 'basically a good person' to please God."  So I guess for myself and my non-Christian friend, it's hopeless.  And hopeless for many others.  Seems kind of, mean, doesn't it?  Hopeless, pointless.       Pointlessness, what IS pointless?  I met somebody, and he was having an argument with another person, let's call them Jon (first person) and Bob (second person).  Jon said that severything was pointless.  One the things he said was "in fifty years, or one hundred, will people remember Julius Caesar?".  Well, the average person won't, and the average go-to-public-school-but-still-won't-do-homework-or-study guy won't, and they don't know.  I didn't, before going to that school, the only Caesar I knew of was the salad, but I learned.  So, after saying the average person won't, he moved on to discuss how all of his achievements were pointless.  Well, let's stop and take a look at that.       He conquered the Gauls, expanding the Roman empire, he went around the Mediterranian many many times, strengthened the empire, and if it weren't for him, Egypt might not have became part of the empire like it did.  If he wasn't murdered who knows what might have happened?  And the Roman empire influenced every area it was in, it even influenced the language I write at this moment, English.  People might not REMEMBER him, but they'll use a language that he helped to make, as butchered as it might get.       So, after a long argument between Jon and Bob, someone that I'll call Susan comes in, and she has something to say about this issue.  Now, let's give some background on this Susan character.  At the beginning of the year, she was pretty cool.  She was into anime, especially Rurouni Kenshin, and anyone into anime must be somewhat good, as most people just see it as some other kid cartoons.  So, she was kinda like me when it came to religion, but then, we went on winter break.  When she came back, I was standing next to her, and something was different, I couldn't put my finger on it.  Then, I saw her during mass.  She was GROVELING ON THE FLOOR BEGGING FOR MERCY IN PRAYER.  I was just blown away.  She was never like that before, and others noticed it too.       Well, anwyay, she comes into this discussion about pointlessness, and says, "look, guys, when I went to middle and high school before this, I was such a bad sinner.  I did just about everything, but I won't tell you too much about that because I'm not too proud of it, and then, something happend to me.  I came to this school, and was introduced to God, and He turned my life around.  I'm just so happy that I found God."  So Susan walked away, and there was an odd silence.  In what way did that pertain to the discussion at hand?  It didn't, some people are just passionate about God so much, well, they just get passionate about God.  So the conversation ended, and when it got a bit too violent, I left.       So, I go to the other side of school (small school) only to meet the new headmaster.  I'm talking to him, an I'm joking around, and say I'm a genius.  He comes up to me, and lectures me about the difference between being smart and being a genius.  So, in reality, he said that by saying your a genius, you are saying you've done no work yourself, but a product of your genes.  I tell him that in a way it's kind of humble if you look at it that way, and he says yes.  So I joke around by saying that to everything two or three times.  Then he tells me that humbleness alone won't get me into heaven...  Another passionate Catholic for you.         Well, I'm out of that school, writing here, in this blog on my slow computer, and I think I'm out of stuff to say, so I better post this before my computer crashes and I have to write it over again.

           It has come to my attention that some people are not aware what a shogun actually is.  In short, he is a military general of feudal Japan.  This has actually reminded me of several things I'd like to discuss on that topic, being feudal Japan.  For those of you interested in samurais/ninjas, this might be a very interesting post.  For those other than that... try another blog.  I've always wanted to write an article on this topic, so here's my chance, let's hope I don't screw it up.      Okay, in feudal Japan there was a rigid class system, one of those classes being samurai.  These were professional warriors, who trained night and day in the warrior arts.  They served one lord, a daimyo, basically a feudal lord.  The daimyos had their little share of land (sometimes pretty big), and the samurais protected that land and enforced that daimyo's laws.  The samurai were paid in rice, to live off of, and were granted residence on that daimyo's land.      Well, eventually a guy named Tokugawa Ieyasu came along (I'm writing the names in Japanese format, family name first, personal name last), and he did a bunch of important stuff (too much that I'd care to write), and he became shogun, the big military ruler, in control of all samurai and daimyo's.  Yes, there were still daimyos, but they had to check in with the shogun for whatever reason.  There was still an emperor, and some of you are probably wondering why I don't call myself emperor in my little online domain.  Well, there are two reasons, the first being shoguns are cool samurai people, and the second being the emperor at that time was more of a symbolic person.  The shogun, being in control of all the samurai, essentialy had all the real power.      Okay, that basically covers and shogun and samurai portion of this post, but there are two more: ronin and ninja.        Ronin (I believe) literally means "wave man".  And that's what they were, wandering warriors, without a lord to serve.  Now, ronins were not samurai (though they carried swords more than likely), though they might have been at one time.  Sometimes they were shamed samurai, and didn't want to commit seppuku (ritual suicied, without going into it), so they just left.  Now, seppuku, even if done under criminal charges or something along those lines, still proved that you had your honor.  So by deciding not to perform seppuku, the other samurai viewed you as dishonorable scum.  Thus, you wandered, probably having to face off against a samurai in several duels.      Now, still on the topic of ronins, and for all those Rurouni Kenshin fans, he's a ronin, not a samurai.  If you have not noticed, he wanders around, with no lord to serve.  Thus, a ronin.      Probably one of the greatest warriors, and also ronin, was Miyamoto Musashi, author of The Book of Five Rings, a book on strategy.  This book has also been adopted for business strategy, and I've seen it in both martial arts and the business section of the book store... somewhat confusing when you're trying to find a particular translation.      Okay, now, for the grand finale, the ninja!  Probably the most controversial topic around.  Now, to clear this up for all of the ninja fans.  If you want to know the real secrets of the ninja... WATCH NARUTO OR READ THE MANGA NARUTO FOUND IN SHONEN JUMP MAGAZINE!      ..... HAHA, I was just joking.  But it is a good anime/manga.  I myself have not seen the anime, but read the manga, and it's great.  Okay, so about the real secrets of the ninja... I don't really know.  In fact, most don't.  There was a Stephen K. Hayes who went to Japan to study the art of the ninja, first westerner to be allowed in I heard.  Well, yes, some probably were assasins, who wore dark colors, and knew every trick of the trade to not only avoiding capture, but to also make themselves invincible in battle (or almost invincible) should they ever get caught on some spy mission.  Okay, well, what about the others?  Like I said, some probably were assasins, but I have seen several paintings of Hattori Hanzo, and he was wearing samurai armor.  In fact, I have heard (don't remember where though) that some even achieved the rank of samurai.  They did have their own province, so why not be able to defend it like the samurai.      In fact, Oda Nobunaga did attack the Iga province (place where ninja clan was) and his army was repelled (eventually beat them though).  Now, when I say repelled, I don't mean they all dropped dead because they were killed by 500 ninja assasins.  No, there was a battle.  Because I believe one of Hanzo's sons, I believe it was Hanzo Masanari was nicknamed "Oni Hanzo" or "demon hanzo" because he was a great lancer, and I don't believe lances are necessarily the best thing to use in assasination mission when you're probably going to want to be stealthy.  So yes, the "ninja" clans did have to fight on the battle field, probably in armor similar to the samurai, with similar weapons, however they probably used more gorilla tactics than the samurai did.  But there probably were ninjas similar to how we see them, who did specialize in assasinations and the art of stealth, just probably a lesser amount than we are lead to believe (such as everyone in the clan was a ninja and they could kill an entire army with one strike without being seen, as in the example above).      Time to wrap this thing up.  And yes, for those intelligent people who noticed the difference between my signature name, Musashi, and the title of this blog, they don't go together.  Musashi wasn't ever shogun, but I liked the name Musashi and I liked the name Shogun's Fortress, so I decided to use them.  This information is not perfect, and I'm always open to learning, blah blah blah, in short, have any other information, I would like very much to see it.  I hope that those people who did read this particular post found it interesting, especially those who are into these kinda things.

           Summer is finally here.  I started a blog way back when, at the beginning of the year, and stopped after about three posts.  Now, summer's here, and I find myself raising the blog from the dead.  But this is a much more fun alternative to watching daytime tv.  So, where to begin?  How about the beginning of the day?      First Monday of summer, I found myself getting out of bed at seven o'clock to make it to my first Japanese lesson of the summer, at 8:15.  I learn Japanese from the mother of one of my friends at school, and for a small fee, teaches me Japanese.  Well, naturally, I tried to pay attention but all the different kinds of verbs were kinda... numerous.  So, basically it's more reading for me to do, and get ready for class again Wednesday.      Getting back home... I did nothing... waiting for lunch, then watching some daytime tv.  Bleh.  A couple of friends are coming over Wednesday night, which mom's not to happy about.  You see, I started a contract, at a certain martial arts dojo near me (the name of which I won't give on this blog).  Well, halfway through my six month contract (apparently, the shortest one they had, you'd know if you like/hate something after six months) I found out how bad the dojo really was.       Didn't make the board requirements?  Oh look, a faulty board, but you broke it anyway, so we'll let you pass.  They'll let any kid pass, which goes to show how, uh, untrue it is to martial arts principles.  So, I stopped going there, at least until school let out.  Mom is now forcing me to go there, and finish the three months (all summer).  But I can't just waste a summer, I have a destiny to fulfill!  So, I'm looking for another dojo, but I can't go to any unless I continue with my damn contract.  FURIOUS AM I!!!      So, basically, classes are on Wednesday, friend are coming over, can't go, mom's mad.  Funny how even if you are in a high ranking position, your mom can still bug you.  Case in point, Nero and his collapsible ship.  I also plan on taking kendo, unfortunately, I just found out two days ago from a very experienced kendoka that all the people left for another club, leaving me with all the lesser experienced people.     BUT THERE IS AN UPSIDE, I have found a decent dojo near me, two actually, and I hope to scout them out soon, however mom won't let me until I start going to the bad dojo.  Darn.      Well, I'm not sure if there's a little intro part thing in the blogs any more, well, I'll just tell you flat out.  In case you haven't noticed, I'm into martial arts, and anime, manga, video games, and uh, a little more martial arts please, and don't forget the Japanese.  Buddy's probably gonna yell at me for putting it at the end, and get mad at me because I'm so lazy (i know you will, and if you don't, it's just to prove me wrong), but I really only seem lazy, and only in things like school and homework and stuff.  Unless the homework is somehow related to Japanese/martial arts.  Well, what a sucessful first post (well, that is if it even shows up, at this very typing moment I haven't published it yet)  and I'll see you all around (if there even is an all to see....).

      It just occured to me, about half an hour before waking up, that I actually got some sleep, wow.  Mom wants to go somewhere, and I actually have some extra energy to burn.  Wow.  Yesterday while at the Science Olympiad, I was so exhausted, halfway through I thought I was just going to fall asleep standing up.    Well, speaking of which, Mr. Caccamo apparently said that we got the raw end of that deal at the science olympiad.  You see, our room that the high school people were at had no air conditioning, and he said all of the middle schoolers got to go in ANOTHER room, with air conditioning, and got to do all of the fun stuff.  Because of that, he said that I really didn't get a good glimpse of the science olympiad.  Well, even so, I still don't think that the science olympiad is for me.

      Last night I was thinking about those old old movies, like Tron, with the very bad special effects compared to this.  And it hit me, "there are some very old animes out there, but they don't look bad." But it dawned on me: the old movies try to mix real people with computer animated effects, but back then the effects weren't as good (well duh), but in the old anime, it's all drawn, you're not trying to mix anything with anything, because of that it doesn't look "fake" in a sense, like when you see real people standing in front of really cheap old computer animation like in old movies.  Now I think I know one of the many reasons of why I like anime so much.

      I was in a car with a bunch of my friends yesterday on the way back to Raleigh from the Science Olympiad.  During this ride we talking about lots and lots of things, just like the ride back, and one thing we got to was the size of the new school.  Carr mentioned that now we can actually move around, and he can actually be late for class, because before all of our classes were in the same room.  Well, I mentioned that at Wake Field middle my locker was on one side of the school, and all of my classes were at the complete opposite end.  Tina all of a sudden said, "you went to wake field?" because Wake Field is one of the biggest public schools in NC, and probably the worst when it comes to the type of stuff that goes on there.  So I said, "yeah, why?" She replied, "I never thought your mom would actually send you there." and it's true, if mom had known about all the stuff that went on there, she WOULDN'T have sent me there.  The only problem was it was the best thing we could find, and I didn't want to stress her out over having to transfer.  Almost everyone there was a loser, except for some, and I suppose some people just have a hard time thinking about how a guy like me could come out of that the way I did.  I guess the only real answer to that is character, I just didn't follow the crowd like everyone else did, I didn't care what people thought.  But I DID change a little bit, but my inner self quickly slapped my real self in the face and told me not to be a loser.

      I just got my mom to change those settings, but I still have this Red background, not the color, but it says "Red" as a background for the internet... weird.  I'm talking again about change, last time I talked about involuntary and voluntary, now, a little bit more about "bad change".  Bad change can be described as a form of involuntary change.  One good example, is "following the crowd", you see others doing it, and thuse you adjust yourself unconsciously to doing it, your mind wanting to seem "cool".  I have known many people who have done this throughout my life, and normally, it can throw off relationships and such.  How can you combat this?  Well, generally, some people have felt it going away when they spend time alone with just themselves, like on a camping trip.  If you don't really like football, but play it to seem "cool" (again, unconsciously), then, chances are on a week long camping trip with just you and maybe some close family, you'll start to ask yourself why you began football in the first place.  This is the first step: realization.  Anytime you realize a problem, you try to fix it.  Now, realization part can sometimes be very difficult, and sometimes it never even happens, but some are very very very fortunate that they DO realize it, and can save themselves.    Well, that's just about it for that kind, but, sometimes a "bad change" can be a blessing in disguise.  Sometimes, you chnage so much, and it's bad, not only jusr forming yourself to fit your surroundings, like above, but bad change in general, your attitude towards things changes, such as schoolwork, for example.  For several weeks, I just quit thinking about homework, but I realized my error, and quickly adjusted it.  Others, aren't so able to change their mindsets.  Sometimes this happens over a course of several years.  Then, you may need a little "umph".  When this happens, you soon (if not, then eventually) that this is a very destructive form of change, so again, you must move to change this.  These bad changes give you a glimpse of what you NEVER want to become, so in a way, you are now MOTIVATED to not do it ever again.

      Well, I set my alarm clock for 5:50 last night, the only problem was, I did that at two in the morning.  So, with no sleep the previous night, I'm very tired when my clock goes off, so, when I turn it off and stand up, I just collapse onto the bed for more sleep.  When I wake up, it is 6:20, and I realize that in ten minutes, my ride is going to be here to take me to the science olympiad!  I already had a bad feeling about it, because the e-mail told us to bring a calculator, and mom said it was just to find out what it was, and I knew that if I needed a calculator, I'd learn by doing...  So we get to RLHS (Raleigh Latin High School) at 6:45, just in time to get a ride.  I rode with Mr. Cacamo and his wife, Merideth, Michelle, and Ben.  On the way there we talked about... lots of things, interesting things you could say, we're an awkward bunch.    Anyway, we get there at 9 o'clock, and the thing starts.  First, we watch a fifteen minutes video, listening to all these geeks say "it's good, we can get recognition," blah blah blah, Ben has been in it, but he's also a black belt, so he wasn't geeky, me?  I never wanted to go in the first place.  So, I get paired up with Ben and Merideth, both of them had been in science olympiad befrore, and we do some math stuff.  Then, we go on to finding out population density, and how much it changes of a fifty year period.  Then, we do an experiment with toothpicks, but we get stopped in the middle.  Then we did some experiment with making a pendulum, and whether or not it was the length of the rope or the weight, I told everyone it was the length, forty minutes later, they come to the come to the conclusion it IS the length.  Wow, I'm pretty smart.  Then we went for lunch, they had pizza.  They literally ordered 40 boxes of Pizza Hut pizza, yay!  Well, after that was bottle rockets.  Bleh, not exactly my thing.  Then we go inside, listen to them talk, show some stuff, we fill out some forms, then we go home.  On the way back we stop at this burger place on the side of the road, just those small places, for dinner.  Then, the long ride back.  I rode with Dr. Prunelle, John Carr (call him Carr), Tina, Greg, and Rob (Greg's brother), again, full of interesting topics.    We get back to RLHS, and we wait, while fighting with the free t-shirts we got, I won!  So, dad comes to pick me up, everyone else is at the pool, I get home, and mom set the parental controls for teenager, DAMN, before it was adult, now, instead of actual NEWS, they give me some crappy info on bands and stuff, like RAP singers, I'm sorry, but I have never even HEARD OF THOSE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.  Now, mom will get an e-mail about wherever I was, where I tried to go, and my IM/e-mail activity.  Why does mom care?  Does she honestly think I look at porn?  Well guess what, I DO NOT!!!!  I feel betrayed, and cut off, the news section was how I found out about things going on in the world, I don't care about some crap band.

      I don't believe this, mom is going to force me to get up at 6:15 tomorrow morning, just so I can ride with my chemistry teacher up to some science olympiad thing.  I'm not really into that kind of stuff... that's Ben's department (friend of mine).  And I want to sleep in until forever, I literally didn't go to sleep last night.  I got in a fight with Buddy, so at night when I went to bed, my mind was swimming.  Then, I realized I hadn't studied my hiragana sufficiently enough for my Japanese lesson at 8:30 the next morning.  (this was all last night by the way).  So, twelve o'clock rolls around, when I finally get my argument out of my mind, only to remember, again, that I need to study.  I told myself I'd do it in the morning, and I laid there for two more hours.  by two in the morning, I finally got up and said, "Roland, you are not tired, go transliterate some Japanese."  So, after two hours of transliterating (just writing down the sounds for hiragana/katakana, my lessons are mixed up so I really don't know the meanings for the words I see, kind of complicated), I decide to pack up, and go to sleep.  That's, four in the morning.  By four-thirty in the morning, I now realize that sleep is an impossible dream, so, now I proceed to actually translate the stuff I transliterated earlier, with the help of my newly bought Japanese dictionary.  Then, when I'm ready to do the 30 more I thought I had, I turned the page of my photocopies (she just copies them because her book is very old, from college), and I realize I'm missing 4 pages of sentences!  >_  Well, it's six, I got no sleep, what is one to do?  I lay there at the ceiling, hoping for only half an hour of sleep, but I realize that even though I only sleep for half an hour, when I wake up I will be extremely angry, so, I just get up to get some leftover chicken for breakfast, and a glass of lemonade to wake me up.  That sleepless night did wonders for my skills, because for the whole hour and fifteen minutes of class, what did we do?  Translate.  I was all over that, translating this this and this, all because of my no sleep night.  So, we leave, she tells my mom I'm doing well, mom is glad, we go, I have three mountains dews with lunch, because I still have karate to go.  I get there, we stretch, knuckle pushups on the sidewalk outside, then, sparring.  Wow, I hadn't sparred for literally a year and a half.  Was I ready?  Yes.  My first match up was just... exercise, easy, warm-ups.  Seconds match, sit out (uneven number of people), third math, up against second degree black belt, rules: kicks only.  Well, whe was good, I would block her kicks, , she'd keep coming, and I'd kick, but I was so tall, she'd duck.  Well, then I just aimed for her back, so when she ducked, I'd hit her in the head.  Lost by two points though, oh well.  Last round: that girl from the previous post, she was tough, we could do hands attacks, but only back leg wheel kicks in the kicking category.  It was hard.  She duck and go for my side after my kicks, but after twice I easily had all of her techniques down.  I kept switching sides to keep her confused, and it worked.  So I get home, more argument with Buddy, I am blocked.  Oh well, wait for three hours, so I browse the "Alphabet Soup" thing I got kicked off from, and I must admit, not bad, not bad at all.  Well, yesterday when I found out the news, one name sticked out, he has a blog, but I won't name him.  At the end of 5th grade, I hit him.  Apparently he has fallen in with another certain person from my past, whom I don't like, and is now obsessed with cars.  Why cars?  Easily influenced by his new crowd, but then I read something he said.  He said something along the lines of "cars have always been a man's muscle."  That's it, see, this guy had always been kinda shrimpy, I suppose, cars make him feel tough and attractive?  I don't know, whatever he does, I don't care.  So during that three hours of being blocked by Buddy, a lot happens behind the scenes, things that I chose to stay out of because of our tension.  Sufficed to say, it has been mended, but the thought of what we are capeable of saying and thinking will linger in my mind for a long time to come.

      Travis, I'm very sorry for not being able to read your post, apparently nathan has deleted it.  I bet it was good though.  Well, I wasn't around that long, but yes, I was part of the Alphabet Soup group blog.  And guess who came up with the "Alphabet Soup" title?  Me.  So if I'm not going to be around, then don't use that title.  And no, for those people this pertains to, I DID NOT BLOCK YOU BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE "CRITICISM".  I'm sorry, but if you think I strayed to far away from the story, too bad nathan, if you wanted your story, then maybe you should have written more than a paragraph.  And for those interested, this is alphabet soup http://alphasoup.blogspot.com/  I was part of that blog, and it wasn't the criticism people, think whatever the hell you want, it was nathan and his ignorance, to be frank.  I told him he gave me nothing to work with, and he said I shouldn't rely on the previous post.  Well, when I said that I didn't, he got mad at me for not sticking to the story.  Which one did you want?  Stick to you, or not?  You were a bit vague.    Anyway, I think I'll take a break from the internet, not get online as much.  I've got Japanese, and karate, and kendo, and lots of reading to do.  Not enough time for the internet.  But I'll still be around occasionally.  Just, having a life outside of the world wide web, outside of this tiny armchair in front of this tiny computer.  I seek to learn, and experience, which is more than some do.  I wish those some well, and hope that they may be content with their tiny little world.  Like I said though, I'll be around to update, catch me then.  And now I'm off to do a little Japanese translations before I sleep.

      I just got finished watching Spriggan.  All I can say is... WOW.  Amazing, but then again, I don't really watch anime all that often, though I would like to.  Animation, great, action, awesome.  Cool technologies.  But, there were some funny things.  First, being these guys would hide behind their cover, and not get shot by the enemies maching guns, then a cyborg would come along, w/ a small gattling gun on his arm, and mow 'em all down, even when they were behind cover.  And second, I came up with this awesome sword technique to be used in anime.  One would thrust one's katana into the stomach of another, with the sharp edge up.  Then, one would pull the katana up through the enemies body, and out his head.  And then, the guy in Spriggan does THE EXACT SAME THING.  But then again, the guy in Spriggan then proceeded to mow him down with a huge gattling gun, which I didn't think of.  And LAST BUT NOT LEAST.  Wheneve I make a little person w/ my two fingers as legs, I always give him the ability to run extra fast an jump extra high and far, like a super ninja.  Well, EVERYONE IN SPRIGGAN COULD DO THAT!  I felt so... robbed.  But Spriggan did come before my ideas did... sob.

      I just got back... wow, I be honest, I can teach that class, 99 percent of the time I was making MYSELF do it, they didn't tell me to do all of those katas that I did, and when everyone else was going to get some water (like every three seconds) I'd still be doing katas.  However, when I was doing my kata, I atracted the attention of not just the instructor, but two girls and some older woman.  Well, when I was practicing, I reached four conclusions of what those girls were thinking.  1) wow, he's good at kata 2) ugh, he's bad at kata 3) WHOA, he's hot 4) UGH, he ugly  Then again, a combination of above.  Anyway, at home I like to totally beat up our huge sand-filled punching bag (at first it hurt, now I'm beating it in!), so I get there, and they want me to beat the crap out of their water-base ones.  They were so light, but after the workout I had to put MYSELF through, I was so tired.  This was my first time back in three months, so the instructor paired me with some totally hot girl, and she wanted to know what I had questions about, and what I knew.  I said, "I know a lot...  lemme see here".  So, she just said we go through katas.  I just starting doing them, one after another after another, and after about three, she stopped to talk to her friend, who was the same age but with another student.  Anyway, THAT'S when they start looking at me and forming opinions about me...   At the very end of karate class, they made someone lead the "cool down stretches", well, whenever I'm picked to do the cool down stretches, I'm going to make the class meditate, see how the crappy American dojo likes that!  I wanted to meditate at the end so badly too.    That's it for karate, but on a much earlier note (like around 8:30 or so) I was beginning my Japanese test.  I might post some of the questions (they're easy, even for me) in a later post, because since she's not professional or anything, the test was just handwritten and stuff, so I have the sheets.  I knew just about everything, the only problem was... HIRAGANA!!! duh duh duh.  I thought I knew the katakana, but she said some of them were wrong... and I have no idea why.  Went to go rent some movies, and I found... in the anime section... SPRIGGAN!!!  Wow, I sure do like the "..." and suspense.  Also went to Borders and bought Rurouni Kenshin vol. 5 (manga, I'd get DVDs, but they're too expensive, and I don't have cable or anything), along with a handy Japanese/English dictionary, MWAHAHA.    Well, I'm all cooled off now, so I think I'm going to get some ice cream.

      Well, here I go, getting ready to go to my first karate class in order to finish up my three month contract to that... dojo, if it even deserves that name.  Bleh.  I know when I get there, they're gonna give me evil looks, but give an evil smile when I buy a new uniform because my old one doesn't fit...  Oh, if only I didn't have to go there to learn kendo from that terrible kendo club... oh, woe is me... I'll be sure to describe the horrors when I return, if I ever return.

      A friend of mine told me what category I fall into when it comes to religion: agnosticism.  They are the kinda people who say, "Eh, it could be this way, or it could be that.  No way of telling." Before I thought it was just the impartial category or something, apparently not.  Well, I'm not an atheist... right?  There's one for my good points.  Yay.  But if I recal back to my theology classes, thinking in this manner can also give you a one way ticket to hell.    The only reason I might refer to myself as an atheist (though I'm not really one) is because there is always that one Catholic who thinks you either believe or not, and there's no in between, and if you're in that third category, it automatically makes you an atheist.  Then that person proceeds to spread rumors about you all over, and pretty soon nobody wants to associate with you.  Bad experiences with religion, very bad experiences...

      Well, there you go, as I predicted, my posts have been shortened.  And because of that, the long long posts from pre-deciding to make shorter posts era have now been archived, thus, creating a smaller blog.  Isn't that neat?  Other than that, I have no idea what to write at this moment.  My original idea was to sit here, with the title being "Inspired Writing" and wait until I got hit with something to say.  Now there's that above paragraph, and the above title, so I can't do that anymore.  I should probably go study Japanese, it's summer, but my private Japanese teacher still hands out tests.

      Well I was talking to a friend of mine who read my blog, and he told what he knew about ninjas.  Apparently he has taken some Japanese history or something, so he's pretty much the authority around here... except me... and Real Ultimate Power...  So, they apparently never were assasins, but intelligence.  They would pretend to be a samurai, and get into the castles, and sneak around there to spy on the samurai in the castle.  The samurai would only allow a few choice people in his prescence, so stealth was of the greatest importance.  When the ninja got what he needed, he could just sneak away, and casually walk out.  After all, no one would both to stop him as he was a samurai, or just looked like one.  To combat this, the samurai anchored their floors on the sides instead of the middle, so any ninja trying to sneak around would start the floors creaking.  Tokugawa Ieyasu actually hired a bunch of ninja for his body guards, and according to that friend of mine, had them disguised as gardners.   I guess all that answers my question about Hattori Hanzo in samurai armor.  So those few assasins from my previous ninja article didn't even exist?  Oh well.  And actually, also adding to that article, ronins were actually the samurai of fallen/dead lords, not the actual lords themselves.  So if they were serving under someone, and that someone was killed, they would wander around until they were hired by someone else.  Hope that clears everything up.

      Thirty posts... w00...  Well, I just got finished talking to an "aquaintance" of mine.  I wrote him an e-mail about iaido, and then he IM me, and we talk every so often.  Well, you know the people who left the kendo club at the nearby dojo?  Well, he was one of those people.  And like me, seeks more tradition in his martial arts.  A way to better himself through physical exercise, something that I *try* to do, despite all the things... hampering my progress.    Well, he told me that the kendo instruction wasn't up to par, and just this moment he told me some of the details.  Sufficed to say... I'm extremely disappointed.  At first he told me it was a good starting point to learn kendo, though it could only take me so far... but after those details, I don't even want to start there.  He told me some things about the instructor there, sounds... like it's not my type of dojo.  My contact tells me that in his and others' opinions the dojo deviated from the original purpose of kendo.  I said the same thing in the karate aspect.  Mom keeps telling me "when life gives you lemons make lemonade" but she doesn't quite understand the martial arts philosophy, at least mine anyway.  I don't want to have to go to some bad dojo, where the people have less experience, therefore the amount of learning will be less.  I'm willing TO GO TO JAPAN EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T EVEN TAKEN THE LANGUAGE FOR A YEAR in order to lean.  At least they can whack me if I do something wrong...  Well, I just don't know what I'm going to do.  Mom said that we're probably going to move somewhere next summer.  Don't like it here... again.

      As of now... I do not know which direction my life is taking.  By life I mean martial arts, it is my life.  Mine is the path of the warrior, I learn to better myself and find meaning in my life.    However, as you know, my dojo is terrible.  I ask someone about a particular techniqe, and the question passes along four people before reaching the 3rd degree black belt.  Even she doesn't know, stops and thinks about it, then gives a probable use for it.  PROBABLE?  What about PRACTICAl?  Or DEFINATE?  And yes, I know about martial arts being practiced in secret, disguised so onlookers wouldn't notice them, but still, even disguised, they had to retain some use, right?    And in kendo, I would ask everyone if my technique was good, they would shrug and say it was fine.  Everyone, that is, except for one guy, who pointed out the fifty flaws with it.  My sword wasn't straight, pulled it too far back, feet too far apart, shoulders too still, grip too tight, etc.  Well, I begin to think the dojo isn't well... what I was looking for.  So that, coupled with school pressure, I stop for a while.  I get in contact with that guy who pointed out all of my flaws, and he tells me that in his opinion, that dojo was terrible.  Their swords were in horrible condition, etc.  He also told me that he and several others formed another club elsewhere... very far away from me.    Suddenly my good fortune of a close dojo was shattered by the bleak reality that the dojo wanted my money, and when I came back, they'd always give me funny looks.  I don't know why I keep going back there, sure my contract and all, but still.  There's a quote from Musashi, he said, "Even if you practice a particular way every day, if the spirit is misguided then what you believe to be true, is not true, even though that is how you have been taught.  Examine your path, and find out if it is true or untrue."  Well, I've examined the path, and it's definately not true.    Well, for a mind in a state of chaos, that was a pretty quick and clear post.  For once I didn't "dodge the topic" by going into the long history, just have some examples.  And I don't think this is bad enough to make me go insane.  But I have been looking for dojos, and I'll continue until I find the right one.  And I won't go to another one unless I'm positive and get I other opinions.

      I said it before and I'll say it again: great book.  And it can be applied to things other than swords.  The mindset he tells you to have, cool head.  That's needed in everyday life.  Posture is another thing you use in everyday life.  He also says to see the truth of things, and the major principles he wants you to have, not to mention keeping a fight stance natural, and keeping your natural stance a combat one... very usefull.  Well, in the book, just about every other paragraph or so, he stresses not following an incorrect path, because if you misinterpret it incorrectly, then you can wander off the correct path.  And if you are misled, then small distortions can become large distortions.    This is really making me wonder about my current dojo.  I don't want to go anywhere that teaches a martial art that "misleads" in any way.  But that's the problem, it's hard to find a "good" dojo these days.  Not many dojos teach for real life encounters, just karate competitions.  There are several places near here.  One teaches a blend of Tae Kwon Do and Shotokan Karate.  I don't know about the effectiveness, but they won't let anyone under 16 be a black belt, and you need to accomplish five different things before graduating to the next belt.  Seems good, but if they have incopetent teachers then no.  Another one is founded by one who has been through several arts.  Isshinryu karate, some street oriented styles, then jujutsu to get a better understanding of grappling.  His school is based on street encounters, handling pressure, multiple attackers, etc.  He might also give Isshinryu lessons, he is a roku-dan.    I'll continue reading, and looking.  After all, my journey will never end.  I'll move on, mom said that we'll probably move next year.  Nobody really likes it here in NC.  Terrible.  Some of the people are nice, but more bad than good.

      Haven't updated in a while.  Well, earlier this morning, but that really wasn't a good post.  Just when I was about to get online thirty seconds ago, my cousin called... bleh.  I told him I had to get online, I'd been waiting for three hours, and he says "well I've been cutting grass for three hours." He's constantly trying to put himself in a better position than me.  Whenever I talk about stuff like Miyamoto Musashi, he brags about his sword that he got.  Some "Excalibur" sword... tch, I don't really CARE about how your REAL sword is better than my BOKKEN.  Miyamoto Musashi used wooden swords all the time, and look how he turned out.  IMO he wasted a good $200 on a sword he's never going to USE.  What's the point?  There isn't any...    I think that this lack of topics to write is a way that my subconscious self is telling me "get the hell off the computer and do something productive".  So I think I'm going to start on the water scroll in The Book of Five Rings, then do some Japanese homework.

      As you know, my cousins are in town, and they are staying at my grandma's house.  Well grandma got this brilliant idea for one of my cousins to make a play, featuring all the "kids".  Kids meaning until you're 16... I'm 14 so... that means me too *sob*.  Anyway, in the car she was writing it (my cousin) and I saw how she was writing it... bleh.  So I said "gimme that" and I begin to write a script.  Some stupid thing about jewel thieves.  I know, everything's about jewel theives, but what can I do?  So, as I was writing it, I was saying the characters' lines as I wrote them.  All of them were good, IMO, but my cousin said I should be the narrator.  I'm good at being a narrator, but I'm also a good actor (at least that's what everyone said after my last performance at school) so I want to act more than narrate.  I told her if she wanted to be part of it, she could, but she didn't want to (she's the current narrator).  Ugh, I suppose I need to finish it within the next five minutes, because I said I would.

      I haven't really thought about posting that much, I've been reading The Book of Five Rings... I love it.  And at first, his teachings seem useless to those who don't practice in the way of the sword, though many reviewers say you can use those teachings in other things.  And after reading through a certain section a second time, I realize that you CAN apply it to other things.  For example, sparring at a karate dojo.  You are practicing, but then you have to sit out because there's an odd number of people.  You see who you're fighting next, so do as Musashi says, and find out their fighting style.  They like to use kicks to hit your head.  So when it's your turn to fight that kicking person, do as Musashi says again, use the wide variety of techniques you have learned (he tells you to know all the strengths of your weapons, in this case, whatever you can use to block a kick) to block those kicks and strike back.  Well, that's pretty obvious, but hey, sometimes it's right in front of your face but you don't realize it.  Musashi has a way of saying things that make absolutely perfect sense, though you might not have realized them before.  Well, my aunt is coming to NC today, and we're going over to my grandpa's house to cookout, celebrate, blah blah blah, meet my aunt and her kids, blah blah blah, go to pool, blah blah blah come home and... CRAP study Japanese.  Totally forgot!  Arrrgg.

      Everyone has their own path in life, which only they can tread, and it is up to their own choosing, though sometimes they are thrust upon it.  What is my path?  My path is many things, one being the way of the sword, another being the Japanese language, and video games, and reading manga, etc.  I personally do not like sports.  Is there a problem with this?  Well, let me explain something about me first.  I am about 6 feet and one inch tall, estimated, and I've got pretty broad shoulders, and overall a strong build.  Since I was a little kid, I was among the tallest in my classes.  Even when I skipped up to 9th grade, I was still one of the tallest (though not THE tallest).  For as long as I can remember, my mother has constantly told me to play basketball.  I could play football, but my parents never liked that sport because it was so dangerous, but I could always play if I really wanted to.  But I never liked the sport either, because, like them, it was dangerous.  So, I was forced into basketball one year.  It was okay, it was something to do.  Then my mother forced me into it AGAIN, and like the first time, it was something to do.  I tried soccer for a season, then baseball, and tennis.  I had a strong hit in baseball, and in tennis, but soccer had too much running, and both were out in the hot sun, which I didn't like.  So, basketball was indoors, I was "made for it" and so on and so forth.    Well, we move here, and I take karate, and I see something interesting:  kendo.  They practiced during the same time on wed. as the late karate class would, so I saw them spar each other and do kata.  It was so COOL.  One day I decide to take a trial class, and it was amazing.  After finding a good break in school two months later, I started.  On my first day I got my shinai, bokken, and uniform.  I always liked the kata, and the fighting was "fun", despite the HUGE workout and stress you got.    So, after practice, I'm leaving, when I see mom talking to some guy, around 28 or so, and he used to come here for kendo practice, and he was talking to her about it.  that night I found out where my strong hit from baseball and tennis could come in: the strike to the head.  He told me that I had a very strong one (despite me pulling it too far behind my head), and with more practice I could perform all of my strikes like that.  Well, they tell that to everyone, right?  But I knew that was true, and at that moment, I realized what I really wanted to do.  Of course, when my kendo exercises left me so drained, I wasn't able to do basketball on the same day, I'd just pass out.  But that didn't sit too well with mom.  She wanted me to do basketball because I was "built for it" blah blah blah.  But that didn't matter, I REALLY WANTED TO DO KENDO, but she never got that I guess, it was always an argument with my mom.  I was 14, I just wanted to practice kendo, but whenever I went outside, it was always "practice those layups" instead of "do some suburi" which was what I wanted to do (I was never good at those, and they are still somewhat troublesome).  Then that sparked my interest in Japanese things, even the language, and now I'm learning Japanese (and to my surprise, I know more of it than I thought I did).  Sure, I'll never be Japanese.  I'll be in a crowd in Japan, and I'll be the tallest, so what?  *walks up to an old Japanese man who proceeds to throw me across the street with his mad ninjutsu skills*.  I don't care.    I'll just do whatever I feel pulled to do, it's my path, and nomatter how hard one tries, I'll never actually like basketball, or sports in general.  And yes, kendo is looked at as a sport, but I for one do NOT look at it as a sport, but to better myself.  And there are others like me who look at it like that also.  I don't hate people who DO like sports, that's also their path.  (I just hate the people who think they're better because of it *throws them across a football field with my mad jujutsu skills*)  Everyone can follow their own path, but ultimately it's up to them to decide which path to follow.

      Well, I haven't been able to get on for what?  The past day and a half?  That doesn't seem like a lot, but I've had tons of stuff happening to me.  Friday afternoon, my sister got her first issue of NP (nintendo power) in her renewed subscription, along with that collection of Zelda games.  The games are: Legend of Zelda (the first one I think), the Adventures of Link, Majora's Mask, Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker demo, and a retrospect of all the games.  I've been playing on my favorite, Majora's Mask, during my extra free time.  For some reason, I just like that game more than any others.  I think it's all the side quests, and the extra layer of realness that comes along.  Just helping people out seems like you're fixing REAL problems and stuff.  Okay, so yesterday, dad and I went to the mall so he could buy some tools.  Well on the way we stopped at Barnes&Noble and picked up.... A BOOK OF FIVE RINGS!!!  It was originally by Miyamoto Musashi (the real one, not me) and translated by some western and eastern scholars for the Nihon Service Corporation.  The book is.... wow.  Amazing, the way he writes... you really have to hang on every word, like Musashi says.  Then later yesterday I went to Stoffer's party (short for ChriSTOPHER, which is what we started calling Christopher).  Bunch of people were there, some of them were new people that are going to RLHS next year.  It was pretty fun, sat around playing GCN, having some salsa, when all of a sudde, who comes in the door late, but... MIKE AND GREG!  See, Mike and Greg started their own little two man band, and made a bunch of CD's, like Mike's CD, Mike's CD 1/2, Mike's CD 2, Mike's CD 2 1/2 and 2 1/3.  Mostly some remakes (from their beginner's music book, lol) and several original ones.  Their music isn't exactly perfect, but it's good once it gets rolling.  Even Stoffer's dad started to play a little bit.  I should probably get those Triumvirate exam questions up on here, just for laughs.  But I told Ben that we need to change the name to accomodate women, because "vir" in triumVIRate means "man" in latin, it basically means "three man alliance" so, we definately need to change then name.  Last night I dusted off my GBA (I usually play on my SP, but not as much room for hands) and played Fire Emblem, I kind of got motivated by A Book of Five Rings, and guess what... I beat the level I was stuck on.  I just forgot about trying to level people up, and just went with what worked.  Wow.    So now, I think I should go do some Japanese for my lesson tomorrow, and I might have a snack, I woke up at 11:30 today and only had some grahm crackers... hmmm...

      the way you want to be treated.  We've all heard it, and most of us try to abide by it.  For my whole life, I have been told to live by and uphold that philosophy in my life.  But where has it gotten me?  Let's take a look.  Early years: My cousin Sean would always hit me with  something, but mom told me never to do that, so I didn't.  3-5 grade: Kids picked on me and called me fat, I was always the tallest but I was never mean to anybody.  6th grade: First part was homeschooled, then I moved here to NC and went to public school.  Didn't talk to most people, didn't want to become the butt of all the jokes at such a huge school.  7th grade: Went to a Catholic school, where people made fun of me there.  Why?  Mostly because I had a gamecube and I thought Yugioh was a cool show, but they were all misled by the bad American job of it.  Nobody would talk to me unless it was to make fun or laugh at me.  I was called some pretty mean things, but I never returned any of those insults.  In between: I broke my collar bone.  Then I was over at my grandma's house, when my cousin (different one) approached me.  We never talked much, then he started to mess around, then he pushed me hard on my broken collar bone, into a wall which my broken bone smashed into.  Then he went to school and told everyone that, he said "I wanted to toughen him up."  Later, when I went there for 9th, someone came up to me and mentioned it.  I laughed at it and said "oh yeah, I remember that."  8th grade: Skipped  9th: I went to another Catholic school, a much smaller one, one that my cousin when to, the one that broke my collar bone.  Met a couple of cool people, I was friends with most everybody there, and the several people I wasn't really "friends" with, weren't really mean, they just weren't really my type, and I wasn't theirs, but we still respected each other.  Now: Well, today, I was at my uncle's for dinner, when I sat down, and I saw my cousin (one who hurt my broken collar bone) carrying a tray of chicken.  Now, this cousin is a muscular guy, that chicken was pretty light, he's held much heavier things for much longer than this tray of chicken, but he needed to bring it inside.  He was calling someone to open the door, so I went over to open it for him, trying to be nice, but not before weighing my two options.  If I didn't open the door, he'd say "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?  Didn't you see I couldn't open the damn door?"  So I decided to be nice to someone who had never been nice to me, and open the door.  Then he said, "get the hell out of my way." I then said, "you're welcome".  I mean, come on, the guy was a jerk, but the least he could say was thank you, even my grandpa says "thank you", however sarcastic and mean it might sound.  My cousin just says "shut the hell up" and gave me nasty looks all night.  Now, someone commented on this, and said, "you were being a smart ass, saying 'your welcome', he just retorted."  Well, see above comment about at least having some dignity and saying thank you.  This person also said that this cousin is older than myself, and even this friend of mine pushed around some of his younger family.  Well I certainly do not, due to the fact I was not raised like that.  So, my mother and father have said it, "be nice to others" and this friend has said it.  I told my friend all of this, and he said that I "missed the point" as usual.  Well what has it gotten me?  Okay, only thing good, um, 9th grade year.  Well hold on a sec, I try to maintain my easygoing air about me, try to stay fun, around my family and friends.  My family always calls me "dork" or "idiot", and I just brush it off (my friend says I should do this more), and online, we joke around too.  Then somebody says "dork" or "idiot" or something like that.  Well, my happy level tends to drop, due to my past history... the more they say it... the more sad, and eventually angry I become.  It actually takes a while for this to happen, but come on, cut a guy some slack.  This has happened all my life, I try to tell people that, but they just tell me "don't drag things out, that's your problem".  By the end of 7th grade, I was pretty much fed up with "letthing things go", and I decided to take a more defensive stance.  When people crossed a line, I told them.  Then they would say things like "lighten up" and "don't take things to the 10th degree", and this happens until today.    I try to be nice, and respect people, then they turn around and are pretty rude to me, all for their various justifiable reasons, but sometimes they are just too... well you get the idea... I don't like it.  I just thought some of you guys/girls would like to see a quick rundown of my life.  Not too much happy?  Well, not too much WAS happy when it came to school... some friends, but not many, mostly people who insulted me, and only when I was hanging around by myself, which was/still is actually a lot compared to some.

      As I write this, I am currently being harrassed by certain unpleasurable company.  In short: family.  Now, you may think me strange, but on the whole, my family (on my mother's side) is most certainly not pleasant.  She doesn't even like them, despite us being related.  My cousins, in her opinion, aren't raised properly, and judging by the way they are around me, I must agree.  First, it was just my cousins from Texas, they were okay, they didn't stay over at my house, they stayed at my grandma's house, but we'd get together somewhere and have some fun.  Then my cousins from Florida came, bleh x_x  Now, when he arrived, he stayed over at my house on the first night.  And my mom said previously, "he's not going to stay over here, we have stuff to do".  So he stays over the first night.  Then again on the second.  Then on the third day, mom asks my aunt (cousin's mom) if she wanted to stop by my house and pick up his stuff.  Do you know what she said?  "he's fine there".  I just about comitted seppuku, seriously.  Normally he's just an ass, and he's always trying to put me down for "staying online too often" and "not doing any sports".  Well I'm sorry if all of my activities are in the evening, and I don't have much to do during the day.  But do you know what he did when he got here?  Sat down on the couch, whipped out his GBA SP, and started playing.  That's ALL HE DOES!  Then he says "you're always online" to me, when I get on for fifteen minutes.  I just about beat the shit out of him.  WTF!!!  Arg, to last week, this week, and next week, will NOT BE FUN AND EXTREMELY UNPRODUCTIVE.

      Life's been pretty hectic over the past several weeks, but now that relatives are leaving, life will slowly go back to normal, getting back in the swing of things, Japanese, martial arts, sleep, etc.  But that's not the point.  I always like to think I have a mysterious alter-ego, someone that subtly takes control sometimes, and influences my actions.  This might have been influenced by the "other Yugi" in Yugioh.  I think everyone has one of those... but I think my mysterious alter-ego is pretty bad.  He is a very evil me, that likes to be ruthless and cruel, only looks out for numero uno, me.  I try to stiffle this alter-ego of mine, but like anger, if you keep it bottled up inside, he'll break out eventually, usually in times when you DON'T want to be mean.  Well, what do I do in order to keep this alter-ego in check?  VIDEO GAMES!    As terrible as I might be (mostly in fighting games) I am ruthless and cruel whenever facing my opponents in one on one multiplayer action.  Taking out opponents when they're most vulnerable in Halo, using the ultimate combo techniques over and over in the few fighting games I play, never letting up, even if my opponent is trapped in the corner, stuff like that.  Of course, some people might say that's stupid, and how you're SUPPOSED to play like that... *shrugs* it's a good way for my evil alter-ego to get some evil exercise and stretch his legs a bit.  Other than making people not want to play with me anymore (happens all the time with my little brother and sister in Duel Monsters) there's really no harm to it.  Like I said, I think everyone has an alter-ego of sorts, or an "inner Sakura" if you're a naruto fan, lol.  Good people have bad alter-egos, and maybe bad people have good alter-egos, but that's just my theory.  Maybe someday my ambitious alter-ego will get me someplace in the world.  Shogun of the world... heh heh heh.

      Okay, well I haven't exactly been posting lately.  Why?  Well at first it started off as I didn't really want to talk much, then I did want to talk, somewhat, but couldn't really pull myself to do it.  Well now, here I am, kinda bored, so I'm gonna get caught up on my past activities.  First off, gaming, my favorites of my many many hobbies.  What kind of gaming you might ask?  Why, card gaming.  If you're still in the dark, trading card games, think Pokemon, except I actually play the game.  But the game is not Pokemon, the game is Magic: the Gathering.   Well first off, before the game was MTG, it was Yugioh (YGO).  I won't to into the history of how screwy the dub is (that's another story, if you wanna year it I'll tell it), but I'm just going to tell you, I played that game.  It was fun, I went to pojo.com every day, looked at tips, and was even a member of the pojo message boards (Dark Duelist for those who know me as that).  But one day the world championship finals came around, and I saw a look at the top decks: chaos. For those who don't play the game, you can either play a chaos or non-chaos deck to be considered a top competitor.  Some ran anti-chaos, some ran original themes, but overall, it was chaos that won. Now that caused me to look a lot at my current deck, my cheap deck, only two boosters a week deck.  Could it win?  Hell no.  So, what do I do?  I love playing games, and I love that game in particular, but what's a guy on a budget supposed to do?  I quit, that's what I did.  And I looked at some alternatives.  First up was Duel Masters, supposedly getting it's roots from MTG.  Now I'd played MTG before, new *mostly* the rules, and figured it seemed good, but too kiddy, even more so than YGO (the dubbed version, and that's saying A LOT compared to the subbed version).  Even so my brother and I bought the preconstructed decks, and tried them out.  He had already bought the two player starter, so we had a rulebook.  The rules aren't as hard.  I've heard some people older than me play the game, I'm only 14 (at the moment) and I couldn't stand it.  Why?  One reason in particular was blockers.  You opponent had a 1,000 creature on the field and you had 3 4,000 power creatures on the field, and they could attack for the win.  Why?  None of your creatures had blocker.   So, after that failure, I went back at MTG, I had previously bought an 8th Edition themed deck, Sky Slam, to try and get into it a while back.  My brother, in order to play against me, bought a themed deck of his own, I forget the name, but it was goblin centered.  Turns out my brother's deck is just overall better, I can't get creatures out until the second or third turn, by then he has 3+ creatures on the field (swarm!!!).  But I can win sometimes, if he gets manascrewed and I get a creature advantage.  Anyway, moral of that story is: DON'T PLAY UNBALANCED GAMES.  For example, YGO.  Also, MTG is A LOT cheaper (though I still need $15 for a starter set... rulebook), and the boosters have... 15 cards per pack!  That's a lot of cards.   Okay, now on to bigger things.  Up until a while ago, approximately a month ago (but at the time was only a week) I was under the complete impression that I was going to go to the new Raleigh Latin High School, for 10th grade (technically a 9th grader taking 10th grade classes... like last year I was taking 9th grade classes... anyway). Well, one day after I got home from my Japanese lesson, I found out I was accepted into Enloe High School, one of the best in the state (apparently). One reason I even applied there was for Japanese.  So, I got my shedule yesterday, and here's the line up: 1st Period: Honors geometry 2nd: Chemistry 3rd: Healthful Living/gym 4th: Some debate thing: Intro to Forensics/Magnet China and Japan (2nd semester) 5th: Japanese 1 6th: Lunch 7th: Magnet Civilizations&Cultures 8th: Magnet Civilization&amp;Cultural Civics  Now the lady told us the last two periods, C&C program, was a mix for both an Eglish and Social Studies class. I'll have to ask somebody about that.  Well, after comparing the room numbers to the map I also got, I found out one thing: Every class is on the other side of the building from the previous one.  Except for gym, which is on the far side of the SECOND building.  I go from the furthest side of the east wing to the furthest side of the west wing.  ***sigh*** lots of running.  The school said they had teachers walk the routes to make sure people  can still make it for class, then they said that I didn't have time to talk.  I never talk in between classes, I always get to my class first, THEN talk if I have spare time.  Last year I had lots of spare time, but when I was in a big public school, I didn't have much time.  Well this school is BIGGER than my big public school, so I guess I will have no time for a social life.  Oh well, that's me.  That concludes what has happened to me in the past, um... month.

      My first day of school... one word: damn.  I woke up at 5:15 in the morning, to catch the bus which was supposed to arrive at 6:08.  Well it didn't show up, so mom went to check another stop, nobody was there.  Then she called the people who were in charge of the busses and stuff, they said another 20 minutes, this all happened at about 6:30.  While I was waiting, I kept on thinking it was 7:30, then I remembered it was an hour earlier.  So the bus finally came, and I finally got to Enloe for my first day.  I went to the back of the school for my homeroom, it was supposed to last 20 minutes, with about 35 minute classes I guess.  Well as it turned out, one teacher's room got flooded.  Water collected on the roof, then the roof caved in.  So we ended up hanging around in homeroom for about an hour, with only 20 minute classes.  Good thing, right?  Well, they let us out, and I walked briskly to get to geometry early.  The teacher was cool, and he just briefly went over how the class is run, and a small summary of the class.  Class was dismissed, and I went to chemistry.  The halls were SO CROWDED.  People were literally shoulder to shoulder.  I could barely do more than just put one foot in front of the other.  So get to the room, and I sit down.  Then a bunch of people come in right after me, they're all juniors, and one senior.  I'm the only freshman.  So we sit down and class starts, the teacher tells us to write some stuff on the board down.  Then she explains what it is.  We have a quiz Friday on lab safety and.... a quiz on half of the periodic table.  That's today, tomorrow, and thursday to study.  Man, I could already tell that she's one of those teachers who are super hard, and don't care whether or not you pass or fail, they just teach.   Okay, time for the run... gotta get to gym, other side of the campus.  I slowly walk through the halls because of the crowds to hit the doors.  I burst out of them, to find my theory is right: there are lots of people taking this back way.  So I job a bit down the hill, then walk briskly along the path, then up some steps, around the building, run to the back door, run down the hall, going to get to gym... damn!  the bells rings, and I'm not more than six feet from the door.  One coach starts telling people "you're late, hurry up!"  um... ya, guy, didn't you see me RUNNING DOWN THE HALL???!!!  So, gym is usual, pass around the papers, intro, roll, then he tells us the class room part is out in a pod, an even further distance to run.  Then lets us talk.  I just talk to some people near me, where I'm from, blah blah blah.... bell rings, time to run.  This time, I tear out of the building, run around the building, run down the path, then job up the long slope behind the building, then walk to the back door, then carefully navigate through the halls to debate.  By now, I am all sweaty -_-  man, this whole operation sucks.  If there was ONE thing I could change, it'd be this gym thing, because it sucks, big time.  So he passes out another form thing for us to fill out, blah blah blah, okay, class over, time for the best part of the day, the reason I'm going to Enloe in the first place: Japanese.  I hurry along the halls, fast as I could, to Japanese.  I get there, and there's a seating arangement on a projector -_- shit, I'm in the back.  So SHE passes out forms as well, only since her first language is Japanese, whenever she thinks outloud to herself, like, "where'd I put those papers?" it's in Japanese, which is pretty neat.  So,, after going over some basic commands, and how to start of class (stand up, rei, sit down), it's time for lunch.  I heard you can eat on the breezeway, but I'm not sure (it's a path between the two buildings) so I just start walking.  Eventually I found a spot, sat down, ate, then waited around... for a long time.  Eventually I decided to go around the front, because it was nearer to my next class, C&C (a special class for both English and Social Studies).  So I get there, more forms, more policies, and a book list.  I gotta read chapters 1-9 by Monday.  Meh.  I look at the list, and as I suspected mom would like the list when I showed her.  Well, this next part of it (the social studies part) should have been in a certain room, but it wasn't, because that particular room... was flooded.  So, it was located in none other than... the west building.  Meh.  Looks like I'm gonna have to RUN!!!!  *pant pant*  Okay, experience (from that day) taught me one lesson: STAY OUT OF THE BUILDING OR YOU WILL NOT MAKE IT.  You don't necessarily need to run, but at least get out so you can walk briskly.  In any case, as I was walking outside, I saw a number of other C&C people doing the same thing, getting out of the building.  So I got to the media center, blah blah blah... end of school, YAY!  I found mom, went to the car, picked up my sister, then she dropped us off at home, then picked up Erik.  Okay, which brings me to there.  As of now, my mood is fluxuating about this whole Enloe thing.  I'm very pessimistic one minute, then very optimistic the next.  I don't really want all of these advanced classes, I think these unique classes help affect my schedule.  I don't have the same people in any of my classes, and no time in between classes to talk to anybody.  Thus, the equasion  No friends in class + no time out of class = no friends  Uh huh... so, I think my new motto is going to be, "Uh oh, looks like I'm gonna have to run!"  Inspired by Strongbad in Dangeresque 2 and 3 (haven't found one yet).

      Okay, now this  actually  happened on Thursday, but I haven't gotten around to writing this up until today. Now, school starts on Tuesday, which is the day after tomorrow, and I have mixed feelings about that, but I'll talk about that later. This is the open house that I went to Thursday, to walk around my school and figure out my travel route, as it's more complicated that one might think.  The open house starts at 6:00 so we decide to leave the house at 5:20.  Eventually we get there and we see lots of people parked on the side of the road.  We then pull up to some guy, a volunteer dude who is helping to keep the parking lot in order, he tells us all the parking spots are full here, so we can either park on the side of the road, or go down to the west campus parking lot.  Well the beginning in the open house is in the west campus auditorium, so we go down and park on the side of the road next to the west campus.  We go in and lots of people are already there, but more people are coming in.  After fighting our way through the crowd, we reach the auditorium at last.  As we entered, some student volunteer person told us to fill in the front row first, but naturally mom wants to sit in the back, and NATURALLY she didn't see the OTHER student volunteer standing right next to her, who then tells us to fill in the front.  Mom, however, wants to make a quick get away, so we decide to stand in the back and wait.  Eventually the head principle of the school comes up and starts talking, as we find some nice seats in the very back to sit in, and without the stupid student volunteers getting onto us.  The guy starts talking about "You should be proud to be an eagle" and "enloe is the best" ya know, standard principle stuff.  Mom however wants to go with 15 minutes left of the presentation, and go to the homeroom ahead of time.  So we bail out, I tell a bunch of people to get out of the way or else... okay, I just say, "excuse me" and pushed through.  We walk halfway across the west campus, then go out the back doors by the caffeteria, it turns out there are lots of people bailing out of that presentation.  So we trudge down the slope, there was construction going on near by, so lots of debris, and we go down to those portable buildings (pods) where my homeroom is located.  I actually have two homeroom teachers (don't have my shedule at the moment, so I forget their names) one primary one, and one assistant one.  We write our names down, and we start talking.  Turns out there are about 2,400 students at the school, and mom tells them I come from a school of 35.  They're pretty surprised about that.  Eventually, some more people start coming in, so mom and I sit down.  We look around, and mom says that she had to elbow somebody out of the way to get out of the auditorium.  I ask her what she means, and she tells me I told some kid to move, and apparently he had this bewildered look on his face because of my deep voice, then mom comes by and says, "excuse me!" then pushes him out of the way.  She says just enough to push him but not enough to remember her.  Then I remind her that he could just as well pull a knife on me!!!  Oh well, after a short briefing about the school and some questions, he lets us go, much to the student council representative's dismay, as he wanted to play some Enloe Bingo or something...  Okay, now this is where we spent most of our time, walking around.  My first class, honors geometry, is in east campus, we are on the far side of the west campus, so time to walk.  Because of her bad sense of direction, mom had put me in charge of the map and navigation, as she always had it turned the wrong.  So, after walking for about five minutes, stopping periodically, we end up out of that building, walk down the rather long path, then end up in the east campus building.  Found my geometry room, now onto chemistry, on the other side of the school.  We start walking at about a normal pace, weaving in and out of the crowds, and end up near the chemistry room in almost 2-3 minutes.  Mom asks me what my next class is, I tell her healthful living/gym, and it's all the way in the far end of the west campus, we're far end of the east one.  Mom gives a sigh, and tells me to find my next class, Magnet Debate: intro to forensics.  We soon find that way, but I mention I don't know if I can make it from chemistry to the WEST CAMPUS GYM in 7 minutes.  So a teacher walks up to us, we were standing right outside his door.  This teacher turns out to be the chemistry teacher, and old black man, but still seems like a pretty cool guy.  He traces his finger around a back way, through a large bunch of blank space on the map, which is behind the school.  He says there's a back door near the chemistry hall, which I can take, down near the parking lot, then cut across the back of the campus via a small path, then around the west campus to the gym, then I can backtrack to that hall again for debate.  Mom wants to go check it out, as do I, so we both go.  We exit the east wing from the side, then walk down to the parking lot.  We then see if we can locate the back door.  We walk around, then we see a door, we go up to it, and it's really an entrance to some back room.  Not our door.  Then we continue walking until all we see before us are some pods and a bunch of trees.  There's another door which we take, but it's the wrong door AGAIN, but closer, we need to continue.  Past the pods was a small sidewalk, which led up to the back door of the chemistry hall, that's the door I'll need to go out for 3rd period and into for 4th period.   Now, time to trace my trail, we beging to go back down the hill, followed by two girls on cell phones who left the back door.  As we get to the parking lot at the bottom of the hill, we see two or three people emerging from the trees.  We go up closer, to see a small dirt trail, covered with stones (as gravel).  A man comes out off the trail, looks at the map, and speaks to his daughter saying, "yup, this will shave a lot of time off."  It turns out I'm not the only one who needs to cut across the back way.  We go down the rather steep and loose path, almost slipping from the rocks, then up some stairs, to some new pods on the west building.  It's easier to see the trail from the west building than from the east building, so no wonder other people found it more easily.   As we orient ourself, this pretty big man, about 6'4" or something, walks up to us and asks if we need help.  He then tells us there are two ways to get to the gym from there:  I can go inside, loop around then go into the gym, or I can go around the outside of that building with the loop, then come around to the gym.  We decide to go around the outside, we continue on through the back of the west building to the gym.  Next we go around the inside route to see the times; the outside route is much faster.  So, I'll be cutting around the back of the two campi to get from 2nd to 3rd and from 3rd to 4th.  That's nice, I'll be going along the trail where people hang out in the back and sell drugs and all that pleasant stuff -_- joy.   We then go to see my Japanese classroom, and I meet my teacher, she's glad I know over half the hiragana chart already, and I know the full katakana chart.  Though as I suspected, we'll be doing the hiragana first, so we can also read and write sentences we learn, which is still fine with me, I'm very excited about that.  Then we leave that room, and we find out from yet another student volunteer (they're EVERYWHERE, litterally, bugging you about whether you need help or not) and she tells us you can either eat lunch in the caffeteria, all the way in the west wing (my god, my classes after lunch are in the east, another hike) OR I can eat on the breezeway, that path (not the hidden one) between the two buildings.  So I'll probably bring my lunch the first couple of days.  Then we forget about my last two classes, I'll have to find them on my own I guess, somewhere in the east wing, and leave.  In the car on the way back, mom suddently exclaims, "Oh my gosh, I totally forgot about rain.  Well, if it rains you're just going to have to go the inside route to get to gym, who cares if you're late?"  She obvioulsy didn't see the part in the little booklet "... tardyness in class can result in detention."  I guess since school gets out at 2:15 they'd probably keep me until 4... that's how long I stayed after school last year... then again that may NOT be as long they keep you.  Oh well, we'll see... we'll see...  Okay, now just last night, I was talking to a friend of mine by the name of Scott, whom I met at a video game design class last summer (like, last year) and we just talk online sometimes.  Well last night, he sent me an IM that said, "hey, when do you have lunch?"  I told him, and he said, "yeah, me too I think."  Then I said, "you're going to Enloe?!"  He said he was, and we should meet for lunch or something.  We set up a rendezvous point (I only know how to spell it by pronouncing it phoenetically) and I said if he was lying I'd kill him.  Well not really, but I wouldn't feel too great.  And that wraps up my Enloe Excusion.
