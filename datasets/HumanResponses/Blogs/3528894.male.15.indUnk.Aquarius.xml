      Max is my black labrador puppy. He is only 15 months but he weighs in at about 76 lbs! He is freaking huge for a puppy. Nearly full size. Its crazy. He is all energy. He is extremely hyperactive. He can't sit stil if he sees you, literally, his tail wags too hard to sit. He is cool though. He has brightened up my spirits greatly. I have always wanted a dog, but my mom was against the hair in the house, or the dog in the house. But she finally caved in. I have basically been sending all my time with him. Walking him, playing, talking, petting, sleeping outside, etc. Its fun. I think that now I have gotten most of my energy back. My soul has been repaired somewhat. Dogs can do that to you.

      It has been quite a while since my last update, and a lot has happened to me. I will try to hit the highlights of what happened in between the posts.   The day after my last entry happened to be my mom's 50th birthday. When I woke up, my dad talked to me about the grades again. I cut him off and told him that even if I got an A, my overall grade would have been the same, and anyway, I had first honors because the exams aren't counted in the calculation. That shut him up for a while. Later that night, we took my mom out to dinner. She didn't know where we were taking her si she got a bit anxious. Plus she didn't know that we invited some of our relatives. Usually when we go out to eat, its just the four of us, unless something major happens like someone getting a job or something (now that I think about it, we never went out when I got a job) so she was pretty surprised about that. Then we surprise her even more when my dad busted out a ring and bracelet for her right before we got some cake. It was pretty cool. I think that she and everyone that was there enjoyed the dinner.   I started the second week of work after that. That was okay. Nothing really big happened. Since I got to know the guys already we basically just worked (if you work for the state, work = sleep)  Then Fathers day came around. We got my dad some motorcycle riding boots. He picked em out, we just kinda paid for em. That was okay for me though. Later that day   I GOT A PUPPY!!

      I got my report card in the mail today. I openned it up and glanced at the last column of grades. This last column tells you the grade you got for the last quarter, the final exam, and then your final grade overall for that class. As I looked I found all A's and B's, then I see to C's. The two C's were only for the final exam for my Honors Biology and Honors Algebra 1 classes. I wasn't that surprised for the math, I knew that I didn't do so great after I had finished the exam, but for the final quarter I had an A and overall I had a B. Same goes for the Biology but I was at least expecting a B on the exam.  (On a side note, I am in the 'overflow' honors bio class, I have a different teacher than the normal honors bio classes, but I still take the tests for the 'real' teacher. We don't cover the same things in class, and sometimes we are behind cause of some goof balls in the class, but I still have to take the same test as the kids who covered everything and may have even learned more! Of course, my parents don't give a damn about that. All of my friends agree that I am at a disadvantage, but to my parents, its my fault.) So when I finish looking at the report card and put it away. Most of the day, my parents didn't bother me because my relavtives from York, PA came down to visit. Of course, they decide to ask me while I am enjoying myself watching tv. So I gave them my report card and then I prepared for a long yelling. My dad, who took the card from me, likes to compare with how I did from the beginning of the year. So when he sees that I had an A in the first quarter, but then I had a B in the last quarter, he freaks out. He doesn't take into account that the stuff in class gets harder. Then he sees my two C's on the two exams and really goes nuts.  (On another side note, the final exam and the midterm exam combine to make 10% of the final overall grade. So the final is only really worth 5%, but of course that doesn't matter.)  "What happened here? Why is there a C? You werent paying attention that's why, you only pay attention to this( he pretends like he is holding a video game controller)!!    Then he babbles on and on about how I dont pay attention to anything important. MY dad, isnt the type to avtually listen to what you have to say, and he ALWAYS has to win whatever argument you may have no matter how stupid the argument is or how stupid his responses are. He just has to win.   "You don't pay attention and you don't care because I am the one writing the checks.."  More babble. I go to a private school, and the only public school in my area is Woodlawn High (I didn't want to go there, it's known for being really crappy and filled with drug dealers and psycho kids with guns and knives and stuff) My parents like threatening me by saying that if I don't do good, they will send me there. I know they lie because they really never would want me going there, plus if they sent me there, they would have to admit to having a failure as a son, and no Indian parent with any dignity would say that. Anyway, my dad keeps on going and going while he throws my past failures in my face as harshly as possible. Finally after 20 mins of pure verbal and metal harrasment, I broke down. Just broke. I just walked away, into my room and just laid there. Broke. I have a friend who finished college( he is Indian too and undestands the craziness of Indian parents, but at least he has cooler parents then mine.) he told me that eventually the pressure would get to me. I didn't believe him, I told him that I would make it. HE promised me that later I would feel the pressure and that I would go insane. I guess he was right. I just dont care anymore. I dont give a damn. Life fucking sucks.

      It has been a few days since I updated my blog so I will take the time do catch up now. On Monday, I started my first summer job at UMBC. I got in through my dad's connections. I didn't know what I would be doing though. My dad told me that I might be painting the curbs and the pedistrian lines and stuff like that, but he wasn't sure because he had to check with some lady that gives out the assignments. I was happy to do anything as long as I recieved a paycheck. I figured that I could do the painting rather easily since I have done some painting jobs here at home. When I got there Monday morning, I found out that I would be working with the guys down in the HVAC shop (heating, ventalation, and air conditioning.) I didn't mind, but I was a tad bit worried because I didn't know anything about heating, ventalation, or air conditioning. It turned out that the guys were really cool. The atmosphere was very easy going. I was happy.   The first day, I hung around with one guy who I will refer to as Kevin. We went around and fixed some leaky pipes or something in the physics building. That wasn't very hard. And before I went home, I got a celebratory Coca Cola. The second day (yesterday) I hung around with a guy I will refer to as Ron. We went to the warehouse and pulled out a window air conditioner that wasn't working properly. Fixing that took us nearly the whole day. Ron taught me how to sodder and braze copper pipes while we waited for the vacuum to suck out all the moisture in the unit ( I got to use a blow torch!!) He taught me about the air conditioner as we worked, so I really enjoyed it. Today, I worked with a guy who I will refer to as Joe. He is the sort of supervisor dude. I helped him clean up the shop (throwing out trash and sweeping and stuff.) It was an easy going day, except for the intense heat.   So far I am enjoying my job. It amazes me that I am actually being paid for this stuff! Eventually, if I invest properly and save, I can be rolling in the $$$!

      This is my first blog, I got the idea from a friend of mine. I will keep my blogs organized by numbering them, and I will attempt to keep them in a topic and thoughts style. This way it is easiest to go back and find interesting thoughts of mine in my blog.
