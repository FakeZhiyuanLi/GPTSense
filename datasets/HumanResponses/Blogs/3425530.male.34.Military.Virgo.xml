      Well here I am, just about a week outside of deploying to Iraq for 3 months. I never thought I would ever bother with the whole "blog craze", but to be honest it's potentially a great way for me to debrief my experiences and vent some of this neurotic energy.

      Here is a very good description of the US Flag Retirement Ceremony:  urlLink www.bsa-grc.org/flag/flag_retirement.htm

      Today is Saturday, just 3 more days before my journey begins.  Most of this week was spent taking care of paperwork and other outprocessing appointments during the day, and taking care of the kids at night.  It's amazing how fast time goes when you're just doing the day to day, hour to hour things - to be honest, that's how most of my life has passed already.  I know I'm not alone in that sentiment - maybe I'm ahead of the game just being self aware enough to recognize it...then again, recognizing it and doing something about it seem to be two entirely different things!  Yesterday I said my goodbyes to all the folks at my favorite watering hole - The 10th Puka Sports Lounge, affectionately known as just "The Puka"...the regulars are called "Puka Bums"(yours truly, guilty as charged).  *Translation* Puka is the Hawaiian word for hole, that would make the title The 10th Hole Sports Lounge - thus it's the 9-hole golf course bar.  Our motto is "Puka Bums - Inebriatus"  (check out the website -  urlLink www.pukabums.com )   I couldn't stay as long as I really wanted to, a beer and a shot was all that was prudent for me to take in.  I had to take my 9yr old son, Aidan, to his Cub Scout Pack meeting, which I wasn't exactly thrilled about based on my leaving Monday and wanting to get a proper drunken send off from my friends.  Regardless, I did what was "right" - initially only following through because I "had to".  That changed about half way through the Pack meeting - we had an opportunity to participate in an American Flag retirement ceremony.  While most people may associate American Flag burning with radical protesters, it still remains the preferred way to show respect and reverence to an old and worn American Flag. The US Flag code states:   The Flag, when it is in such condition that is is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.   I think I'll track down the ceremonial steps and post them later...just to give an idea of what's involved. The level of ceremony involved didn't have to be as formal as it was, but I'm definitely blessed to have participated in the experience.

      What a day this has been, I'd love to dish about it - but I've pretty much had it for today.  Depending on tomorrow's events, I think I'll recap Tuesday tomorrow.  Now where did I put that bottle of Heineken?

      Back again, sorting through my email and catching up on phone messages, etc.  The reason I put the "OUCH" out there is because I had to get Anthrax shot #3 of 6.  I have to say, of all the 16yrs I've been receiving my Air Force immunizations - Anthrax is the top dog for seering immediate pain!  Typhoid shots are wicked for the knot they put in your arm and (for me at least) the accompanying mild crud that closely follows.  The other pain in the ass for this deployment has definitely been the Small Pox vaccination...the procedure, is here if you are interested...   (  urlLink http://www.smallpox.mil/myVaccination/procedure.asp  )  Well, come to find out I happen to be immune to the Small Pox vaccination - and it's not something that is easily discovered!  I've had to endure the 15 jabs with a needle twice, with a two week wait in between each to see if it evokes a response.  Well, thankfully they stopped short of jabbing me again this time, they just stamped my records "IMMUNE - EQUIVOCAL RESPONSE RECORDED".  I'm off to another series of appointments/briefings...

      Here it is, 0800hrs Hawaii Standard Time and I'm at the office just long enough to grab a cup of coffee before I descend into more of the TDY (Temporary Duty for the non-military folks who may examine my ravings) outprocessing.  Today will consist of my medical and dental clearance procedures, nothing more than a records review thank God.  The most important trip after that is the legal affairs office to get my will updated/drafted, a morbid thought at best but everyone knows this guy called Justin Kase :)  He's kinda like that Murphy guy, but Justin at least helps in the thought processes of most of us.  Time to jet for now, more later as my day unfolds.

      No doubt you may be humming the Star Spangled Banner whilst reading some of my rants, but the importance of what I'm rambling about comes right down to the reason I'm going to Tallil AB, Iraq instead of Al Udeid, Qatar.  I'm essentially going because someone else has failed in there responsibility to our Core Values.  This individual is an embarassment to the NCO ranks and a poor role model for our young Airmen and future NCOs.  There have been many others in all of the various branches of the military who were thrust into a position they neither intended nor wanted in part to someone else shirking their responsibilities.  It would have been easy for me to make an excuse, or find a way out of this particular tasking...but that would go against my personal integrity, my personal belief in service before self, and it would hinder my ability to take pride in the excellence in everthing I do.  For the spiritually minded, 1 Corinthians 10:31 pretty much sums that up - Do all things to the Glory of God!  Which means not just the things you like to do, not just the things you are good at, not just the things that make you look good...EVERYTHING.  Even the lowliest of tasks should be taken for what they are, a chance to expand your ethics, sense of values, and ability to empathize.  Enough ranting for today, there will be plenty to go around down the road :)

      Yes, I suppose a word about this blog's title and description is in order.  As mentioned, if not familiar with the Air Force's core values they are:  (1) INTEGRITY FIRST   Integrity is a character trait. It is the willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking. It is the "moral compass" the inner voice; the voice of self-control; the basis for the trust imperative in today's military.   « Integrity is the ability to hold together and properly regulate all of the elements of a personality. A person of integrity, for example, is capable of acting on conviction. A person of integrity can control impulses and appetites.   « But integrity also covers several other moral traits indispensable to national service.     Courage, Honesty, Responsibility, Accountability, Justice, Openness,   Self-respect, and Humility.   2) SERVICE BEFORE SELF   Service before self tells us that professional duties take precedence over personal desires.  3) EXCELLENCE IN ALL WE DO   Excellence in all we do directs us to develop a sustained passion for continuous improvement and innovation that will propel the Air Force into a long-term, upward spiral of accomplishment and performance.  There they are, in all their simpleness and straightforwardness.  The Air Force Core Values.  No, I'm not the "poster child" for the Air Force recruiting mission - but I am a proud Non-Commisioned Officer who strives to do "what is right" on a daily basis.

      While writing to my father-in-law about my upcoming deployment, I realized that the bulk of my rambling was perfect generalized fodder for my fledgling blog so here is an exert...  I'd like to say I'm not nervous and everything will be just fine - but I'd be lying!  As I get filled up with all the damn immunizations, and my head is briefed and briefed again on my travel arrangements and what I'll have to carry...I just get more anxious by the day.   The worst part is having to travel alone, I have 4 military duffel/mobility bags that I must carry in addition to my personal gear.  Now we've all had to shuffle luggage around airports, but these bags have a typical combined weight of 100lbs!   That's not the kicker though, the most surreal thing is that I'll be traveling commercial with...an M16 for Christ's sake!  It will be in a hardened weapon storage case with locks on it, but just the thought of checking that along with my bags upon arrival at Honolulu IAP makes my head spin a bit.  That's not to say it won't be interesting when I get to my over night stay in Baltimore, MD - I'll have all my stuff, M16 included, in my hotel room.  I'll hopefully be able to secure the M16 in the hotel safe, because otherwise it will be a long night if I can't relax and enjoy one last night of a couple drinks in the hotel bar!     From Baltimore I'll be flying to Frankfurt, Germany on what's called a military rotator...it's a civilian aircraft chartered for military flights to the AOR(Area of Responsibility) - refuel, stretch my legs and fly into Qatar and await a flight to Iraq.  I've already heard from a friend in Balad AB, Iraq ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/balad-ab.htm )- she's just about ready to come home...but she's been dealing with sniper and mortar fire everyday she's been there for the past 3 months - actually she said the place I'll be going in the southern part of the state is better...all that Tallil AB  (  urlLink http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/tallil.htm  ) gets is the occasional suicide bomber attempt at the front access gate!  Now that's reassuring if I've ever heard it ;(   I still really wish I could have maintained my original TDY place and date, Al Udeid, Qatar - that place has base facilities better than what we have here at Hickam!  Check out this link to pictures of Al Udeid - those folks have got it made!   urlLink http://www.myatari.com/g/cci.htm    From what I've heard, Tallil is starting more construction on a limited basis - but it will never be anything close to what you've seen in the Al Udeid pictures.  Tallil was supposed to close based on the return of Iraqi governmental control at the end of June - Ballad is where most everyone is destined to go at some point, so basically it's no use hoping for an upgrade in living conditions...but I won't complain if I'm mistaken!

      Whew!  Just got back from lunch and found this in my email box.  CURRENT TEMPERATURE IS 109.5 DEGREES   BE ADVISED HEAT CONDITION 3 HAS BEEN DECLARED FOR TALLIL AB  WORK 45mins/hr REST 15mins/hr  WATER INTAKE RECOMMENDED:  1 QUART/HOUR  The work/rest thing is fine for those that work outside, but for me...no rest until all my projects are done for the day.

      Entry from yesterday:  I just got here last night or this morning or something - the ride from Qatar was pretty rough, C-130 doing the wartime evasive maneuvers (diving and doing crazy shit!)  We rolled in around 0200hrs did the basic in-processing - picked up our bags/weapons - found our tents but stayed awake.  We all pretty much had to stay awake because there was a briefing we had to go to from 0800hrs to 1130hrs  - then we got our line badges and all that other stuff.  I still haven't been to sleep yet and it's 1800hrs or so...I just took my 5min "combat shower" ( get wet, turn off the water, lather up your head and body at the same time, rinse, and get the hell out) and I'm headed for bed...finally!  ----------------------------------------------------------  I'm on the job this morning - we're working out of an old Iraqi schoolhouse.  There are propaganda paintings of women and children with rifles everywhere - not to mention a fairly prominent painting of Husein in the hallway.  The number one attraction in our operations center for sure...people hear about it and want to get a picture next to the painting(s).  Breakfast was pretty rough this morning, the eggs have more than their fair share of shells in them.  Every other bite was a crackling sensation :)  I think I'll stick to coffee from now on...even if it's not Hawaiian Kona.

      Well after some really messed up travelling time, I'm at Qatar.  I can't use the regular blogger interface because of the Websense firewall filter on the transient computer I'm using.  Not to mention this keyboard is the most bizarre thing ever!  It's got three or four different symbols on each key...good thing I can kind of touch type.  Me and another guy managed to miss our flight this morning - ultimately scheduling a flight out of this place is crazy.  Hopefully we'll be on a flight to Tallil later this afternoon - if not, we'll have to try again tomorrow.    I'll blog again at a later day...hopefully when I get established with my own contingent of computers to command and control :)

      I'm at BWI in Maryland right now, using one of the free computers at the USO lounge.  It's not too bad, I only have 30mins to use it though - actually now I have about 10mins after sending out a few emails to the family.  The trip from Honolulu to Minneapolis wasn't too bad, but the trip from Minneapolis to Baltimore was brutal.  A plane full of high school kids from North/South Dakota were headed to Washington D.C. for a field trip - once we had some air turbulence a few of the kids put their "barf bags" to good use.  Unfortunately, nausea seems to reproduce - a couple of people lost it just by the odor alone...yeeeccch.  Then it came time to grab the bags - about 50 kids all pushing and grabbing at the luggage carousel...they backed up when they saw my M16 though.  I wasn't exactly pleased either, all my bags made it okay except the weapons case has a whole in it now - that and some genius who inspected it didn't put the locks on correctly - thus, M16 sans case rolling through the carousel!  Boy did I get some much needed space :)  That's it for my time limit, I'll blog again later - or when I get to my destination.  I've got to stay here until my flight leaves tonight...that makes only 7 hours to go.

      I'm down to the wire now, only thing left to do is pack a few more items and pick up my M16 from the base armory.  The weather is absolutely the best here, 80 degrees - sun shining - light tradewinds...a typical postcard Hawaiian day.  I'll bid all an Aloha from Hawaii and make my promises to keep in touch, now's my time to enter the fray.  It may be a couple days, but I'll surely recap once I've arrived in Qatar or Iraq.

      Here it is, the day has come already.  The less than harmonious sounds of my sons making themselves breakfeast fills the air, who would have thought making toast could turn into such a battle!  I can tell that they're both playing the stress of my leaving off of each other, I understand - but it forces my hand and I have to yell at them to STOP!  The last thing I want to leave the kids with is the impression(or reality) that the only thing I know how to do is yell!  The next battle is already queued up, they're demanding to watch cartoons instead of  urlLink Operation Crossbow  (back to the TCM Memorial Day marathon) - okay, there's been some intense fighting and one of the early Buzz bombers has crashed...  now they're interested  .  I'll have to take my leave right now, I'll probably post later - but for now I have to get some more clothes washed and dried for packing.

      I'm definitely paying in full for last night's excess at the Puka...too many shots of Rumpleminze and way too many Heinekens!  Regardless, last night was the send off I had hoped for on Friday.  So here I am nursing a slight hangover, watching TCM's Memorial Day weekend marathon of war movies.  Just got done watching  urlLink Run Silent, Run Deep  - one of many excellent classic movies I could watch back to back.  I had watched a little bit of  urlLink In Harm's Way  and  urlLink Navy Seals  on AMC yesterday...but you can't seriously have  urlLink Navy Seals  follow a classic, it should be coupled with movies like  urlLink Top Gun ,  urlLink Heartbreak Ridge , and  urlLink Full Metal Jacket .  All respectable movies, just differences that should be recognized. I love the movie  urlLink The Green Berets , but I wouldn't want to see it immediately following  urlLink The Flying Leathernecks .  That's probably why I still prefer TCM, they have an appropriate reverance for movies and understand that one movie could set the tone for another, while yet another movie could make you reflect on one you had just seen.  I'm watching  urlLink The Red Badge of Courage  now, it's pretty surreal to think I'm packing my gear to go off to a hostile area while watching these movies.

      It's 0800hrs and I've resisted the temptation to go in to work, even though today is my only day off.  I was going to do some laundry, but all the other folks who are off today seem to be perched on or around the machines like harpies.  I don't even like talking to the oddballs at the post office, you know the ones who can't stand in line without trying to talk to you!  Anyway, I'm just not in the mood to have a conversation with 8-10 people over my choice of fabric softeners :)  My choices are narrowed down to spending the day in the Library, the Keep in Touch Internet Cafe(where I am now), or the Hot Spot.  The Hot Spot is doing a movie marathon, no real theme involved...just whatever sounded good at the time.  I wouldn't mind watching movies over there, except the chairs are those folding kind that offer just enough padding to keep your ass from going numb in the first 20mins - but not padded enough to be comfortable throughout an entire movie.  The TV Room has recliners that are "oh, so comfortable", but AFN (Armed Forces Network) is the only thing allowed on the TV ;(  Catch 22 at its best...  I'm going to make an attempt at redemption tonight...NO, I'm not going to church.  I'm playing in a 9-ball tournament at the Hot Spot, hopefully I can lose gracefully this time.

      I knew I hated Bingo for a reason...because I'm never any good at selecting the right card.  All I can say is, at least it was free.  Can you tell I didn't win?  Bitter?  Not me :)  Today has probably been one of my more "down days", I feel okay...I'm just in a shitty mood.  It's probably because I've got to use my internal clock to wake up in the morning vs. an alarm clock - the alarm clock is hopefully on its way in a care package from my loving wife.  Anyway, I should say my internal clock is more apt to be called a water clock...with all the water we have to drink here during the day, I average about 3 jaunts to the latrine trailer every night.  If I find myself having "to go" anytime from about 0230hrs on...I pretty much have to stay up.  To go back to bed and realistically think I'll be able to get up again at 0500hrs on my own is far fetched at best.  I've been up since 0230hrs today, which is fine - I'd rather be a little tired and ontime for work, than rested and late...definitely too many folks have adopted that habit here.

      It's 1740hrs, I'm supposed to be "home" right now enjoying the finer points of Tent City living!  I've got folks on nightshift that need my assistance, sooooo...I'm sticking around to make sure they have "happy, productive computer usage".  While waiting on a customer might be a great song title or an awesome pickup line in Vegas...it's not much fun.  It's a good thing that the Tallil Network Control Center has "morale media" online and available.  Morale media is locally streamed movies and music over the computer network...we get to enjoy titles like - Haunted Honeymoon, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life,  There's Something More About Mary, Monsters Inc., and about 7 other various titles.  I watched a little bit of Tomb Raider, but Angelina Jolie isn't exactly the best thing to be watching when you're on a 3-month sexual starvation diet. :)  Hopefully I'll be back in Tent City by 1930hrs, they're having "Combat Bingo" over at the Big Top (biggest inflatable tent on base), grand prize is a portable/personal DVD player.  I hate bingo, but this should take me right up to bedtime where I can sleep at least another 8 hours of desert life away...

      Well, things are incredibly busy here at times...but there's always time for supposed stress relieving activities.  I've found that I really suck at 8-Ball and Ping Pong!  Rick(the Canuck) beats my ass on a regular basis - we have a ping pong table in the front lobby of our building, always time for a "quick round".  Last night I participated in an 8-Ball tournament over at the Hot Spot (our recreation tent - complete with popcorn machine, numerous TV's, jukebox, DVD rental, pool table, dart board, and ever present ping pong table).  Anyway, I was doing pretty well throughout my one entire game - until I scratched on the eight ball ;(  I still had a fairly good time - the most fun was the two Dutch soldiers that joined in the tournament.  These guys were a hoot, except for when they were busting on me for drinking a Non alcohol Beck's beer...you see, all our coalition forces partners can consume alcohol.  The Italians are especially known for their wine, most the other forces have their contingent of beers.  The torturous thing for me of course is the fact that the Dutch have Heineken and Grolsch at their disposal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I know there are some of our American forces making goodwill ambassador visits to the other compounds and accepting the hospitable gifts of alcohol...but for me, as tempting as it is - the thought of losing a stripe or receiving any punishment because I can't get over my love for beer...just ain't worth it.

      I have to reserve a spot in here for one of the most down to earth people I've met in awhile, present company excluded of course.  Anyway, there's this civilian contractor that shares our abandoned/bombed out temporary supply complex.  He works for FedEx, his name is Rick and he's from Calgary, Alberta, Canada - what a card this guy is.  You can always count on Rick for a laugh, whether he truly meant to tell a joke or not.  He's just so blessed honest it kills me!  I'm honest, but I guess maybe my honesty is a little bit brutal and straight to the point *snicker*.

      Well, didn't get to see Van Helsing last night - watched part of America's Sweethearts starring John Cusack, et al.  It was okay from what I saw of it, at least until the ground started to shake and a tremendous explosion ensued!  It seems the Italian soldiers were disposing of unexploded ordnance and weapons.  This in itself is not unusual, our EOD(Explosive Ordnance) guys do it all the time, but they announce it over the base loud speaker...BEFORE starting!  Nothing like a couple bricks of C4 explosive to make your night!

      The heat advisory hit level 5 today, and that was just before noon.  Man, who ever said "it's a dry heat" should be strung up :)  I've been remiss in putting my snail mail address out here, well here it is:  SSgt Michael Durkee  407th AEG/ELRS APO AE 09358  Care packages are always nice to share with my fellow Tallians, but most definitely not necessary!  Just the occasional email from the wife and kids, family, friends, and the internet voyeurs *snicker* is fine.  Actually had a chance to see Troy last night in the entertainment tent, tonight hopefully will be Van Helsing.  Troy was fairly decent quality, despite someone getting up for popcorn a couple times during the movie when it was being "illegally filmed" in the theater.  Hey, I know the copyright thing is getting stomped on by the "sneaker-vision" or "Haji-vision" people - but in this case...WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IRAQ, during A WAR!!!!! Justification?  Maybe...

      That's right, misunderstandings.  They don't usually happen when discussions are finished...without one party walking off.  The definition of insanity:  Doing the same thing time after time and expecting a different result.  I know I'm insane - but others should have a look at their insanity too.

      With all this alienation business I forgot to mention that I still insist on playing Combat Bingo...and losing!  Three women from my unit won, a digital camera, a $50 gift certificate, and a Fez(you know like Sydney Greenstreet wore in Casablanca)*snicker*         Needless to say, the woman who won the later was less than thrilled!

      That's alienation, not  urlLink Alien Nation  that pretty much covers things here lately.  I've alienated and more than likely seriously hurt the Canuck's feelings, it is my fault...I pushed for a friendship knowing that military/civilian friendships are a fragile thing.  There's a standard that is at the core of every military branch of service (if there's any doubt to my feelings about core values, especially,...peruse my early blog entries).    There are a lot of sublime differences between what's considered acceptable behavior in the civilian and military sectors.  It doesn't mean that civilians can't adapt to what the military finds acceptable...but it sure as shit means that we can't revert back to the bare minimum conduct.  This is difficult as hell to describe in generalities, but basically - there are just some things that you can say and do as a civilian that we in the military can't(hopefully for the most part...WON'T).  These are extremely hard things for some people to learn after years and years in the military - I don't expect someone dropped into the military community fresh from civilian life to transform/change in a matter of weeks...that's unreasonable.  With that said, I've removed myself from the situation.    I like Rick, I still think he's the most honest guy I have(or possibly will)ever know...unfortunately I'm not doing him any favors by constantly telling him what he can or can't say in public.  Of course by public, I mean everywhere since we're constantly in the military community.  It really sucks, but I hope he'll understand in time.

      Finally, a chance to get back to the blog.  Last several days have been a bit of a blur, guess that's what happens when you have insomnia...     I finally did get some sleep last night - maybe because I kicked the Canuck's caboose in the 9-Ball Tournament.  Only comments from Rick are...I'm never playing that game again (AY), it's all fluke.  Okay, Rick.  Sour grapes :)  I was just happy to win a game during a pool tournament, I'm still pretty rotten at ping-pong though.  Yesterday during one of my fits of sleeplessness, I had a whole little "Duality of Man" movie double feature.  Started with  urlLink Full Metal Jacket  - ended with  urlLink Hair .  Hair is still one of my favorite guilty pleasures - songs are great and Treat Williams is a trip.

      Real world permeates where it can, my friend Rick received word from his family back in Canada that his nephew had died.  It's frustrating and painful to see a friend going through the grieving process...it's human nature to want to help, or somehow   make   the pain go away.  The reality is that I can only give him his space and let him work out his pain in his own way - of course talk if he needs to.  The stress here is enough without hearing news like that from home - I'm sure if it becomes necessary to go home...he'll be able to take some R&R time.

      Remember Rick the Crazy Canuck from a couple posts back?   Well, he's got the blog fever - I set him up with the basics...you can check his progress  urlLink here   To recap yesterday's events...  I ended up going to work after all, took care of some things I really had to do - plus a couple things I didn't have to.  Went back to the Hot Spot and watched the rest of Hannibal...I started watching it at work but kept getting sidetracked, so I checked it out from the counter and finished it off.  The book of course was so much better, but the vision of Ray Liotta with his skull peeled away is one to remember...  Later last night I played in the "big" 9-ball tournament, lost my ass again to a lucky shot :(  I've been up this morning since 0200hrs, I just couldn't sleep - so I managed to drink too much coffee and get my laundry done.  I feel pretty good now, then again it's only 90 degrees...plenty of time to feel sweaty, sluggish, and crazed from the heat :)

      Did I forget to mention that I finally won at Combat Bingo?!  It's about time, even if I only won a $20 gift certificate...at least I won.  One of the kids(okay, maybe "kid" isn't the best choice of words...but he's 19!) I work with won a personal CD player - the grand prize was a PlayStation.       I didn't stick around to see who won the PlayStation because things were getting pretty ugly up in the Big Top...the woman that was supposed to be verifying the possible correct bingo cards in the audience was absolutely not entertaining at all.  I don't fault her for trying, but she was trying too damn hard!  As far as the MC gig for the Talent Show...I'll leave it at just saying "it fell through" or "didn't work out".  If I go into details now, I may push my fingers right through the keyboard whilst I hammer out my disappointment ;(

      I've had this quote for quite awhile and thought this would be nice to share with everyone who may pass this way...if you are the author or know who is, my all means please let me know your name so I can give credit where it's due.   We could learn a lot from crayons: some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, some have weird names, and all are different colors....but they all have to learn to live in the same box.   Isn't that nice?  A few of my other favorite quotes are from  urlLink Tom Waits    Champagne for my real friends, real pain for my sham friends."  No, I don't have a drinking problem except when I can't get a drink.  I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.

      You may or may not have seen my brother, Joe's, comments in regard to the difference between ordinance and ordance...just the same I want to do good by him and his fearless EOD crew.  Although I don't know his current crew, I had the good fortune of meeting up with Joe several years ago while I was at Lackland AFB, TX for 7-Level training - he introduced me to his crew at the time and we had a blast(pun intended, of course)!  Now Joe is a Senior Master Sergeant select stationed at Ramstein AB, Germany.  I've since corrected the Italian Fireworks post, but I just wanted to call special attention to the differences in the two words/spellings in question.  According to  urlLink Merriam-Webster Online :    Ordinance 1 a : an authoritative decree or direction : ORDER b : a law set forth by a governmental authority; specifically : a municipal regulation 2 : something ordained or decreed by fate or a deity 3 : a prescribed usage, practice, or ceremony    Ordnance 1 a : military supplies including weapons, ammunition, combat vehicles, and maintenance tools and equipment b : a service of the army charged with the procuring, distributing, and safekeeping of ordnance   Thanks for keeping me straight, Joe! :)

      I was officially presented with my Technical Sergeant stripes this morning, I was glad to see our deployed commander and the rest of the "promotion crew"...well, until I had to go through "the gauntlet".  My arms are still little numb from the tacking on...      *I don't know if I've made my military disclaimer before, but for all those fellow Airmen, Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines that already know some of the things I refer to...I'm sorry, I've got to at least give brief explanations of some things time to time for the civilian populus* .   With that said, the tradition of "tacking on a new stripe" is that of punching the promotee in the arm(s) to symbolize making sure it sticks.  The gauntlet therefore is receiving the tacking on from a room full of folks, some punch harder than others...especially the folks who didn't make it!  ----------------------------------------------------------  Holy crap!  The EOD guys set off a monster detonation right in the middle of my paragraph above - they had given an advance notice through email, but it's not something in the front of your mind when the glass in the windows rattles and stuff falls off the shelves!  Rick is pretty well pissed off, he gets left out of the official communication loop...when I have a chance I forward the emails that I can.  It's been about 15mins since the detonation and Rick is still hopping mad...

      Well, it looks my crazy personality may come in to good use on the 4th of July.  It seems that some of the folks organizing the Holiday Talent Show think I'm a riot, and get this...they want me to be the Master of Ceremonies :)  If not the sole MC, at least split the responsibility with another candidate.  I don't know...there are plenty of people who think I'm hilarious(except the Mrs.) - but I don't know about being funny on demand :)I don't get stage fright, I can do Karaoke sober anytime - anyplace...okay, except at home when the Mrs. is present.   I guess doing the MC gig could be a good time, even if I'm the worst MC in the history of Air Force talent shows...in about 2 months I'll be back on the shores of Oahu and hopefully forgotten by the talent show attendees.

            Wheew!  It has been a long time coming for this promotion!  I never thought I'd see the day - I was starting to settle into the desparation of eternally being just an E5/SSgt.    According to my line/promotion number I should put on E6/TSgt sometime around October or November - I know my wife will be happy, she'll be able to work a couple nights a week at the Bowling Alley at Hickam...instead of every night.  Only thing is...what's a promotion party without Heineken :( *sniff, sniff*

      I love it when the Communications Squadron folks get the efficiency bug!  It seems there was an over abundance of network accounts that didn't match up with users that were still here at Tallil...what's the logical thing to do?  Get an outdated list of personnel and categorically begin to wipe their user accounts.  I've spent the past three hours or so attempting to recover as much of the unfortunate users' profile settings as possible.  I'm achieving about an 85% success rate, pretty damn good - but still frustrating for the customer...I understand, but they insist on venting on me for the 15% of their data that's irretrievable.  It's still Sunday back in lovely Honolulu, and the Mrs. emailed me a Happy Father's Day greeting - that sure helped perk up my day.  I had completely forgot about it yesterday, which is okay with me - nothing like dwelling on the melancholy to jack up your day :)

      Okay, more on the alienation topic.  Since I can't discuss the matter in person...I'll have to blog about it, my apologies to the other 50 or so people who may stop through my humble brain dump.  Italicized text is from my original Alienation post...    There are a lot of sublime differences between what's considered acceptable behavior in the civilian and military sectors. It doesn't mean that civilians can't adapt to what the military finds acceptable...but it sure as shit means that we can't revert back to the bare minimum conduct.    Okay, by that statement I had no intention of portraying myself as superior to anyone - most especially my Canuck friend.  I meant to apply a comparison to show that there is a diffence in learned behavior, and when I said "revert" it was supposed to mean that I more than likely wouldn't go back to the way "I" was before I joined the military.    This is difficult as hell to describe in generalities, but basically - there are just some things that you can say and do as a civilian that we in the military can't(hopefully for the most part...WON'T). These are extremely hard things for some people to learn after years and years in the military - I don't expect someone dropped into the military community fresh from civilian life to transform/change in a matter of weeks...that's unreasonable. With that said, I've removed myself from the situation.      I like Rick, I still think he's the most honest guy I have(or possibly will)ever know...unfortunately I'm not doing him any favors by constantly telling him what he can or can't say in public. Of course by public, I mean everywhere since we're constantly in the military community.    Alright, now I really did jack up what I wanted to say in the above text.  Let me try to salvage the message, I hope.  I didn't mean to suggest that a civilian, or more specifically - Rick,  couldn't  or  wouldn't  learn what's generally acceptable and what isn't...my meaning was supposed to convey the fact that in time he may resent me for constantly correcting him - rather than have him resent me, I thought it best to let him be himself.  Thus, "removing myself from the situation" should have the same conotation as "let him be and stop picking on him".    It really sucks, but I hope he'll understand in time.     I appreciate our friendship, it's not often that you get to meet a guy like Rick - he'll do anything for you.  Rather than trying to keep him from resenting me in time...I definitely accelerated the process.  For what it's worth I'll end this blog with a line from an old Randy Travis song:   I hear tell the road to hell is paved with good intentions And mama my intentions were the best There's lotsa things in my life I just as soon not mention Looks like I've turned out like all the rest But mama my intentions were the best

      Yes, another Sunday...the 4th of July at that!  It's 1100hrs and I'm already fighting the urge to go in to work.  Started out the morning pretty well, around 0500hrs or so I wandered over to my home away from home away from home, The Hot Spot.  While waiting for the monolithic coffee pot to brew it's black treasure I helped my friend, Brian, set up a couple ping-pong tables and hang 4th of July decorations.  I dunno if I mentioned Brian before, he's one of the guys whose job it is to put up with patrons such as myself - my other friend, Bart also works over at the Hot Spot.  Definitely a cool couple of characters, I'm glad to have them around - they're always worth a laugh or ten :)  Around 0700hrs I went back over to my tent and tried to wake Phillip up, he swore he wanted to get up early and didn't want to waste his day off sleeping.  Yeah, right!  He finally got up around 0830hrs.  We finally made it out of the tent in time for me to lose my ass in the first round of the 9-Ball tournament, as a consolation I told Phillip I'd teach him how to play Chess...my intentions were entirely philanthropic...I taught him the basic movements of each piece so we could play Chess when we're bored - instead of drinking near beer and watching DVD's.  Only problem is...he's pretty good!  I wonder if the 19yr old Wunderkind(German for WonderKid) actually new how to play all along and he was just humoring me to give me an ass kickin'!  I'm not signed up for any other of the numerous events today, I just intend on participating in the 4th of July Special Combat Bingo!  All cash prizes, scavenger hunts between games, you name it - it should be a good time...we'll see.

      Didn't do worth a crap in Bingo again last night, all was not lost though...they had karaoke afterwards, well until the #(@#@# amp clipped out :(  Other than that these last couple days have been all work and no play, and it's making Mikey a real dull boy :)  The last couple days have been a toss up, the generator for our building has blown out and with it went the air conditioning and several of the computers.  I'll be spending a good portion of my day today fixing a couple crashed hard drives.  I haven't talked to the family via telephone in awhile, I thought I might be able to do that today but all I got was the answering machine - and the rest of the attempts to dial out have failed.  I'll keep trying though...trying to pick a time to call and talk to all the kids and the Mrs can be pretty difficult when there's 14hrs time difference.

I was in agony until the Mini BX opened at 1000hrs, thankfully they had actual Prickly Heat powder - I couldn't put that stuff on quick enough.  Other than that, my Sunday was just peachy.

      Sorry, didn't mean to mislead...I still lost in the weekly pool tournament.  I did get into the finals before I sunk the eight ball midway through the game...lost out on the prize money.  50$ :(  A quick word about yesterday's blog entry...my coworker, Travis, pointed out my mistaken word entry.  I had originally meant to say auditable documents vs. audible documents - the documents are meant to be filed and not heard :)

      ...because their printers suck!  We use Kyocera FS3800 printers for our legacy Supply systems to print out audible documents, I've got four of them here at my location and currently zero are up and running.  The sole Kyocera printer that did work went unserviceable after someone tried to clear a paper jam and broke one of the paper feed rollers.  I can't say I blame them, paper jams are second nature to these overpriced pieces of crap.  I hope something decides to go my way soon...

      The last couple days have been a real pain in the ass, or ankle rather! While walking to the D-FAC I wrenched my ankle stepping up to one of the few sidewalks we have here...that was painful, but what really became excrutiating is when I wrenched again later that day walking to the shower trailer!  I'll have to post some pictures to illustrate exactly what kind of terrain we have to navigate over daily.  The sound of that sounds pretty exotic I know, but the truth is we're not forced to walk over endless sand dunes...rather, we're made to walk over endless amounts of stones, gravel, pebbles, and rocks.  You won't be able to fully appreciate the amount of rocks until you see a picture of them.  They are used to help with drainage and when there is no water, they help cut down on the amount of dust devils and blowing sand in Tent City.  To make a short story long, I've been hobbling around for the last two days - grumpy as hell and sleeping too much now.  I've got to wash clothes, I'm down to my last pair of drawers - but the thought of carrying my overstuffed laundry bag to the washer/dryer tent is less than appealing.  Worst aspect of that is the possibility of trudging all the way over to the W/D tent and finding there are no open wash machines.  Somebody get me a saucer of milk, quick...I'm starting to mew a little too much!

Thus the previous blog entry... ----------------------------------------------------------------  Just received confirmation today that our new Supply complex has all the tents and trailers needed, now all that has to be done is construction and infrastructure(AC, Power, Phone, and Network cables).  Oh yeah, we still have to move every single thing out of our current location - yippee...I'm in the middle of a computer and peripheral equipment inventory.  Anytime computer stuff moves there are always problems...  It's a good bet that once we get into the thick of moving our duty days will go from 10hrs to 14 - 16hrs...

      ...yes, imagine the thought of your's truly being a loser at Bingo, again!  I'm sure anyone who has been keeping up with me wouldn't believe such a thing possible, but alas it's true.  Just to rub salt in the wound a bit, I know two of the winners - one is stationed in Hawaii with me and the other one works with me.  My fellow Puka Bum, Jerry, won a mink blanket of all things...I guess it will keep him warm on those oh so cold Hawaiian nights!    The big prize, an RCA Lyra MP3 player, went to my friend and coworker,Shawn.  This thing is sweet! It retails for around $160 and a very nice thing to have...some people have all the luck.  That's okay, Shawn wasn't up on MP3 technology so I still got to mess with the player for a couple hours this morning while I showed him how to load MP3s and configure the software...now I really, really want one...I'm feeling a bit like Golem!      I wants it, my precious...I needs it...oooooh MP3s, my PRECIOUS!

      ...that's what deployments are made of.  We had a six hour power outage at work the other day, it's kind of hard to do my computer job without power :)  Of course the power came back on at the end of the work day when we were loading into the pick-up truck for the commute to tent city.  Once we got to tent city, Phillip and I stopped by the Hot Spot for our daily Beck's NA - you guessed it, no sooner had I a near beer in my hand then...whoosh - the power went out.  All I had was a $10 bill, thankfully the power came on again just long enough to get my change :)  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Yesterday I received a care package!  I was pleasantly surprised, because the only package I was expecting had only just been mailed off by the Mrs two days ago...I might see it in another ten.  The care package came from the town my wife grew up in, Cassadaga, NY.  Ooops.  My apologies, I had better get this right or get chastised...Cassadaga is actually a beautiful little village in the town of Pomfret, NY - just down the road from Dunkirk and Fredonia.   urlLink Click here to see the map.   I have to extend a huge Mahalo(thanks) to the congregation of Cassadaga Community Baptist Church, the care package contained a toothbrush, toothpaste, crossword puzzles, sanitary wipes(a definite must on deployments), candy, cheese n' crackers, and last but not least an NIV "field bible" complete with desert camouflage on the cover.  The bible was dedicated on the 9th of May...I don't know if it was by coincidence or design, but that is also my wife's birthday.  Mahalo nui loa once again to all those who keep me and my fellow servicemen and women in their prayers, as the lovely card in my care package reminded me...  Philippians 4:13 says:  I can do all things in him who strengthens me.

      Whilst browsing through my Blogpatrol logs, I noticed a visit from the Defense Intelligence Agency...the question is, Was it an "official" visit?  Is it someone's job to check out various military bloggers to see if they're divulging sensitive information?  Anything is possible, but there's always the chance that some employee at the DIA was simply doing a little surfing through my number one referrer -  urlLink The Indepundent , and decided to check out a couple of the military blog links.  Whichever the case may be, I'm doing my best not to post anything that would be considered sensitive information.  I'll leave the blabbing of sensitive data to  urlLink CNN , they really seem to enjoy exposing crucial military objectives. :)

      Sunday, as you may well know from reading my blog entrys, is my day off...a chance to relax and basically do nothing.  Well, this Sunday was definitely a good time...four of my coworkers and I had a chance to ride on one of the Medical Airlift Blackhawk helicopters!       I know my wife will be amazed when she hears that I actually voluntarily chose to fly, the only time I normally fly is when I have to!  I was pretty mellow 20 minutes out from our take off time...       ...things changed just a little bit after the first time we went just about straight up and straight down again!  I had a great time and enjoyed the flight, no matter what the picture below may suggest :)

      Hopefully today will be a little more relaxed than the rest of the week - Friday took a lot of spring out of my step.  A looming computer inventory, problems getting assistance from Langley on a mainframe report, and to top it all off...my workstation gave me a beautiful BSOD right when I thought I was actually going to get caught up!  See, for all those out there that may think they're the only ones that fall victim to system failures/crashes in the middle of something important...think again, we computer support people deal with it too.  I was going to stay and work later than I did but decided to call it a day and walk back to Tent City.  I went to take a power nap before Combat Bingo, but when it came time to get up...I decided staying in bed and not dealing with anyone or anything sounded better.  I rolled over and was out until 0400hrs this a.m.  I think I slept too much though, we'll see how the day progresses.  At least I recovered my workstation right away this morning...maybe I'll even do a backup of my important files...who am I kidding?  I'm a computer guy...we never back up important stuff :)

      how bizarre.  You can almost hear the trumpets playing now, that little catchy tune...ooh baby, it's makin' me crazy...etc.ad nauseum.  There is a serious problem in the ranks when our senior leadership has to send out a message like the following:  I know it is hard to believe, but even our most professional folks experience periods of frustration while trying to do their jobs.  Even the best of us lose our professional “cool” and decide to vent our emotions against someone else.  If not managed or controlled, it detracts from the atmosphere of safety and the realm of professionalism that must surround the conduct of every one of our missions.  When this type of “venting” happens, symptoms are present in the form of attitude, ignorance, sarcasm, and lack of dedication to doing the job in a professional manner which could result in the loss of lives, aircraft, or other Air Force resources.  Here are a few guidelines to assist you in developing a mature, professional approach in dealing with your daily frustrations.  Keep skid chains on your tongue; always say less than you think.  How you say it often counts more than what you say. Make promises sparingly and keep them faithfully. Never let an opportunity pass to say a kind and encouraging word to or about somebody. Be interested in others.  Let everyone you meet feel that you regard him or her as someone important. Be cheerful.  Hide your pains, worries, and disappointments under a smile.  Don't suppress it--talk to your supervisor or first sergeant. Preserve an open mind on all debatable questions.  Discuss, but do not argue. Let your virtues speak for themselves and refuse to talk about another person’s vices.  Make it a rule to say nothing about someone unless it’s constructive. Be careful of other people’s feelings.  Wit and humor at someone else’s expense are rarely worth the effort, and may hurt when least expected. Pay no attention or ill-natured remarks about you.  Simply live so that nobody will believe them. Don’t be too anxious about your dues.  Do your work, be patient, keep a pleasant disposition, forget self, and you will be rewarded.  It's all really good advice, but it's like that Bill Engvall routine/song...HERE'S YOUR SIGN.  Actually it's like signs in general, if a sign exists...more than likely someone has done exactly what the sign warns them against.  We've got problems with NCO's thinking that hard work and positive attitudes are beneath their rank.  We've got NCO's gossiping and carrying on like children on and off duty!  We've got NCO's attempting to get what they want by blackmailing other NCO's.  We've got married NCO's running around with members of other Coalition Forces.  The common thread among all these different NCO's...they are women.  Don't get me wrong, I'm absolutely...positively not a misogynist, the things I'm talking about are true and negatively impacting everyone.  So far, most attempts to correct these indiscretions have seemed to work for about a day...then all goes to hell again.  Hopefully these next 40 something days will show an improvement in the current bizarre trend...but today all of it just seems to be simmering under the surface.

      Instead of linking to a Word document I decided to push the limits of the maximum characters allowed for a single post...I thought it would be easier and speak volumes once you start scrolling through that monster of a post :)  If you think it's tough reading through the Tent City rules...try living through them.

      USAF TENT CITY RULES  Everyone in USAF Tent City, military or civilian, US or coalition forces, will follow the rules below by order of the 407 AEG Commander.  These rules are directive in nature.  They are not ‘nice to do’ nor are they ‘optional.’  They are mandatory.  These rules are based on force protection, safety, and maintaining military morale, good order and discipline to accomplish the mission at a bare base, in a combat zone, while living in close quarters with one another.   There will be times, due to the constant turnover of personnel, when you may see someone who is not in compliance with these rules.  When that happens, inform him or her of the rules and help educate them.  Help your “buddy” before a first sergeant, chief, or commander corrects them.  We all must contribute to making the team as strong as possible – those who do not follow these rules make the whole team weaker.     NOTE:  ONLY USAF PERSONNEL MUST FOLLOW THE “UNIFORM RULES” as they are specific to the USAF.  However, ALL personnel in the USAF Tent City will follow the other rules.    General Order #1A is in effect per order of CENTCOM Commander: •	No Alcohol or Controlled Substances •	No Pornography or Sexually Explicit Materials •	No Gambling to Include Sports Pools, Raffles, etc. •	No Personally Owned Fire Arms •	Do Not Enter a Mosque or Other Islamic Religious Site •	No Drug Paraphernalia •	No dogs, cats or pets of any kind 	 FORCE PROTECTION: Think Force Protection at all times.  Never forget we are in a COMBAT ZONE.  You may be the one who saves lives by seeing and reporting a situation.  If something looks suspicious, call Security Forces at XXX-XXXX to intervene.   •	TENT CITY ENTRY:  A Tallil AB Restricted Area Badge is required to enter the compound.   Some US military and coalition personnel will not have Tallil AB Restricted Area Badges; therefore, USAF personnel with a valid badge can escort these individuals.  USAF personnel who escort guests into Tent City will assume responsibility for supervising and ensuring their guests adhere to all Tent City rules. •	RESTRICTED AREA BADGE DISPLAY:  Tent City residents are not required to display the Restricted Area Badge while within the confines of the compound.  However, at times of heightened awareness, the group commander may require the badge to be worn.   •	RESTRICTED AREA BADGE AND SMART CARD:  Keep your Tallil AB Restricted Area Badge and the Tallil AB “Smart Cards” with you at all times.  The “Smart Cards” (2ea) contain key phone numbers and information about actions required in case of a fire or an attack. •	TENT CITY ENTRY/EXIT UNIFORM REQUIREMENTS:  Desert Camouflage Uniforms (DCUs) or physical training (PT) clothing will be worn when entering and exiting the Entry Control Point.  Those who reside outside of tent city (e.g. Fire Department, EOD, and Readiness) may wear civilian attire to and from their quarters into Tent City. •	TCN/LN AWARENESS:  Be vigilant and pay particular attention to the location of Third Country Nationals (TCN) and Local Nationals (LN) operating in Tent City.  Detain any TCN/LN not under the supervision of a US escort and notify Security Forces immediately.  SAFETY:  Be alert and help each other stay safe.  If it doesn’t seem right, don’t do it.  If you see a problem, fix it or take it up the chain of command.  The group Safety office is available at XXX-XXXX to assist.  •	FIRE IS OUR BIGGEST THREAT:  Prevent it and know how to respond.  If a fire occurs in Tent City, ring the triangle alarms near tents, yell “FIRE, FIRE, FIRE” and keep calm.  If air horns are close at hand, utilize them by sounding long blasts.  Have someone get to a phone to call 911 or the Fire Department at XXX-XXXX, and stand by to direct emergency vehicles to the scene.  Tents contents and activities will meet all fire safety standards. •	NO SMOKING IN TENTS OR WITHIN 25 FEET OF A TENT:  Ignition sources are not authorized within 25 feet of tents.  This includes incense, candles, heated or burning insect repellants, etc.  Smokers are allowed to smoke in designated areas only and must remain within 10 feet of an approved butt can.  •	NEVER THROW DISCARDED CIGARETTE BUTTS ON THE GROUND OR INTO THE TRASH:  All smoking material must be disposed of properly.  Field strip all cigarette butts before disposing of them in an approved container. •	EXERCISE EXTREME CAUTION WHILE WALKING OR JOGGING OUTSIDE TENT CITY – ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT:  Poor roads and reduced visibility due to blowing dust, combined with considerable heavy vehicle traffic make it very dangerous. Currently there are no working streetlights, therefore, with the exception of Security Forces, all personnel must wear a reflective belt and carry a flashlight outside of Tent City at night.  Use sidewalks where available, otherwise, face oncoming traffic.  HEALTH AND HYGIENE:  Good health and hygiene habits contribute to our ability to accomplish the mission and maintain good morale, welfare, and readiness of all personnel.  Common ailments during your first two weeks here include: nosebleeds, diarrhea, athlete’s foot, insomnia and dry, itchy eyes.  Drink lots of water, approximately 1-2 liters per hour if you are out in the sun, and then drink some more.  •	WASH YOUR HANDS:  It is the single best thing you can do for your health.  Wash and sanitize your hands after smoking, using the toilet, sneezing, coughing, working out and definitely before eating.  •	KEEP YOUR LIVING AREA CLEAN:  Trash receptacles in living, work and public areas will be emptied into dumpsters at least daily or when full, whichever comes first.  Do not place trash in butt cans or other containers not specifically designed for rubbish.  Do not use latrine or shower trash receptacles to empty your personal trash, take it to the dumpster.  Always ensure garbage bags are tied and secured. •	ALL PERSONAL HYGIENE ACTIVITIES WILL TAKE PLACE WITHIN SHOWER OR LATRINES ONLY:  The shower and latrine areas are the only authorized areas to brush your teeth.  Urinating in ‘bottles’ is prohibited.  Personnel must clean up after themselves.  Put your empty bottles in the trash cans provided and empty them in the closest dumpster when full. •	CLEANLINESS OF LATRINES/SHOWERS:  Keeping these areas clean is everyone’s responsibility and conducive to maintaining sanitary conditions.  Personnel will wipe down sinks and toilet seats after every use.  Shower curtains will remain inside the shower compartment lip while being used in order to prevent wet/slick floors from becoming a hazard.  Remove/dispose of all items in the shower and sink after each individual use.  During muddy conditions, personnel will remove their boots or shoes and change into clean shower shoes before entering the showers.  Equipment, muddy boots and shoes will not be cleaned in any of the latrines or showers •	WATER BOTTLES:  Use bottled water for drinking, but do not waste water.  Discard empty bottles in a trash receptacle.  It’s not necessary to use bottled water to brush your teeth …our water is potable. •	KEEP YOUR TENT FREE OF ‘FOOD’ DEBRIS:  Animals, snakes, rodents and bugs will quickly find any ‘food’ you don’t get rid of properly.  If you eat snacks in your tent, you must clean up after yourself thoroughly. •	CLEAN AND SANITIZE YOUR CAMELBAK:  Rinse it daily and flush the tube.  Use a teaspoon of bleach in a full bladder of water once a week to fully sanitize. Rinse twice after bleach.  Sanitize your canteen at least weekly if you use it. •	CHANGE INTO CLEAN UNDERGARMENTS AND SOCKS DAILY: Bathe daily.  Keep your feet dry and open to the air when possible.   •	MINIMIZE THE ‘BUG’ THREAT:  Leishmaniasis is a potentially fatal condition caused by an organism carried by the sand fly and transmitted to humans by its bite.  This threat is in Tent City and all of our work areas to varying degrees.  Contact Military Public Health (XXX-XXXX) for specific details on prevention.  (Details are also briefed at Right Start) Also shake boots, uniforms and linen to remove insects prior to use.     •	PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE SUN: Clothing is the best sunscreen. SPF 30 protects you for a while, but not all day. It needs to be reapplied every 2-3 hours. SUNBATHING IS HIGHLY DISCOURAGED.  If you sunbathe, do it discreetly, in an inconspicuous area near your living quarters.  •	ABSTAIN FROM SEX:  This is the only 100% effective protection against getting Sexually Transmitted Diseases. •	KEEP YOUR IMMUNIZATIONS (SMALL POX, ANTHRAX, ETC.) CURRENT.   Medical personnel will contact you if your records indicate you are delinquent. •	PREVENT SPORTS INJURIES:  Stretch and warm up before exercise and sports activity.  Don’t exceed your physical limits.   LIVING:   There are challenges when living at close quarters with one another, but with each of us living responsibly, and doing our part, it can be a good experience. •	TENT CHIEFS:  Every tent will have a designated “Tent Chief.”  This may be the senior ranking person living in each tent, or an individual appointed or designated by the First Sergeant.  The Tent Chief is responsible for ensuring the living quarters are maintained in accordance with the Tent City rules.  He or she will also ensure Tent City rules are followed by the occupants in his or her tent.   •	FRATERNIZATION AND UNPROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WILL NOT BE TOLERATED:  Unprofessional relationships are ones that adversely impact morale, discipline, unit cohesion, respect for authority, or mission accomplishment.  Dating and public display of affection can fall under the unprofessional relationship category.  No public display of affection is allowed in tent city. •	NO MALE AND FEMALE OCCUPANTS LIVING IN THE SAME TENT:  Females will not enter male tents and vice versa, unless it’s mission essential or official business.  ABSOLUTELY no cohabitation. (See rule below on tent vestibules, dayrooms, patios and decks.) •	MAINTAIN LIVING QUARTERS:  Tent occupants are expected to make sure tents are properly tied, all ropes are tightened, and tent sections are staked and sandbagged to prevent wind damage.  All occupants are responsible for ensuring the tent remains staked down after high winds.   •	CONSERVE WATER:  This includes taking a combat shower (strip, get wet, lather up, rinse).  You are allowed a maximum of 5 minutes of running water.  Also shut off water in the sink while you are brushing your teeth or shaving.  Wash with a full load of clothes or reduce the washer water level if you do not have a full load of clothes to wash.   Do not wash bulky items such as pillows, comforters, blankets, sleeping bags, etc. in the machines.   •	TENT MODIFICATIONS:  Self Help alterations and additions to your tent must be coordinated through your first sergeant, and approved by the Civil Engineer Squadron (CES).  CES has an approved design for the addition, including a material listing.  The materials may be obtained through CES, provided stock on hand is in excess of mission requirements. •	TENT VESTIULES, DAYROOMS, PATIOS OR DECKS:  Structures added to the tents are considered common areas, provided the original tent entry door is still in place.  Members of the opposite sex may commingle within these confines.  These areas are intended to be used as a gathering place for watching movies, playing games and/or socializing.  All activity in these areas will be conducted with consideration for all occupants of the tent.    •	QUIET HOURS:  We are a 24/7 operation.  People are sleeping at all times in Tent City.  Personnel will observe quiet hours 24-hours a day in the living areas of the compound. This rule will be strictly enforced to afford a rest environment for shift workers.   •	CIVILIAN ATTIRE WILL BE CONSERVATIVE AND IN GOOD TASTE:  Personnel may wear conservative civilian attire free of any offensive language or logos. Appropriate attire includes slacks, jeans in good condition (no holes, tears or stains), mid-thigh or longer shorts, and conservative shirts.  Pants/shorts, shirts, and shoes or flip-flops must also be worn to and from the showers/latrines.  Attire deemed to be detrimental to good order and discipline will not be worn. •	TENT ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT BE CHANGED WITHOUT APPROVAL:  Personnel are not allowed to change tents without his/her first sergeant’s or commander’s approval.  First Sergeants are responsible for notifying Billeting and PERSCO of all relocations.  This is essential for accurate personnel accounting in case of emergency. •	THEFT WILL BE PUNISHED:  Theft of materials, equipment, furniture, other government supplies, or personal items will be investigated and will result in disciplinary action.  This includes removing items from any tent even if it appears ‘unoccupied.’   MORALE, WELFARE AND RECREATION (MWR) FACILITIES:  Tent City residents may utilize all MWR services within Tent City while wearing civilian clothing provided the clothing styles and logos are conservative and conform to the standards of good order, discipline and morale. •	MWR FACILITY ATTIRE:  All users of the MWR facilities must wear their duty uniform, proper civilian attire, or the USAF PT uniform.  Proper attire is pants/shorts, shirt, and shoes.  DO NOT enter these facilities wearing sweaty/smelly gym clothes.   •	FITNESS CENTER ATTIRE:  All users of the fitness facilities must wear proper gym attire.  Proper attire is shorts, shirt (including tank tops), and shoes.  (Women may wear sports bras) Outer garments such as sweatpants, sweatshirts, lightweight windbreaker pants and tops may also be worn.  Shower shoes are not appropriate. During inclement weather, bring a clean pair of shoes to use in the gym.   •	VOLLEYBALL AND BASKETBALL ATTIRE:  Residents participating in volleyball games may remove footwear and shirts while in the volleyball court area.  Shirts may also be removed while playing basketball.  Women may wear sports bras. •	ATTIRE FOR EXERCISING OUTSIDE OF TENT CITY:  If you exit Tent City for the express purpose of exercising (running on Airport Road, running the Army physical conditioning course, completing the Air Force PT test, etc.) you may wear any proper gym attire.  Proper attire is shorts, shirt, and shoes.  Outer garments such as sweatpants, sweatshirts, lightweight windbreaker pants and tops may also be worn.   •	ARMY DINING FACILITY (DFAC) ATTIRE:  The only authorized clothing allowed in the DFAC is the duty uniform or the locally approved USAF Physical Training (PT) uniform. (Gray shirt with “US Air Force” lettering.)  See current Tallil AB Policy letter on this subject located on the Tallil AB Intranet.  UNIFORM WEAR:  Proper wear of the uniform instills pride and professionalism in each of us.  All personnel will wear the DCU while performing primary duties.  The blouse may be removed when performing a work detail or in the immediate work area when approved by the supervisor.   •	ALL USAF PERSONNEL WILL ADHERE TO AFI 36-2903 “DRESS AND PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF AIR FORCE PERSONNEL” AS AMENDED BY THESE RULES. •	DESERT CAMOUFLAGE UNIFORM CAP:  The cap will be worn without alterations.  Name tapes are not authorized on headgear.  Floppy hats must be worn with the brim down and the drawstring under the chin, behind the head, or tucked inside that hat. The floppy hat will not be worn “cowboy” or “Aussie”style, with the brim rolled up, nor will it be worn hanging around the neck.   •	TENT CITY AND FLIGHTLINE AREAS ARE DESIGNATED AS “NO-HAT” AREAS:  Hats will be worn outside of Tent City except for the flightline area within the entry control points where a FOD hazard exists.  Hats are not required while performing work details where the DCU shirt has been removed or while operating heavy equipment vehicles, such as forklifts, backhoes and loaders. •	WEAR OF DCU IN TENT CITY:  Members are not required to wear the DCU blouse when traveling from their living quarters to latrine or shower units, in the smoking areas, or in the basketball/volleyball area.   •	WEAR OF SCARVES:  Wear of an issued scarf or triangular bandanna (brown/tan) loosely around the neck (as a sweat rag) to protect the face and neck during sandstorms and as protection from the sun is authorized. In extremely hot and dry conditions a wet sweat rag worn loosely around the neck will assist in body cooling.   •	SUNGLASSES/FLASHLIGHTS:  Sunglasses must meet the intent of the AFI 36-2903.  Vendor names and logos are acceptable unless too faddish (a commander or first sergeant will make that determination).  Black, brown, silver and gold frames are permitted. Mirrored lenses, lenses that are not earth tone (brown, black), and multi-colored lenses are prohibited. While in uniform, sunglasses may hang around the neck if worn with straps.  They are not to be worn on the head or hang on any part of the uniform.  The micro flashlight may hang on the DCU shirt or flight suit. •	GOGGLES:  Goggles are highly recommended at Tallil to protect your eyes.  While in uniform, goggles (includes the standard issue Wiley X goggles) may be worn around the neck when not in use. •	SLEEVES:  Sleeves may be rolled up or down IAW AFI 36-2903 or the cuff of the sleeve may be rolled under to aid in cooling of the body.  Security Forces personnel are not allowed to wear the DCUs with the sleeves rolled up.  This is due to the possibility of tactical movement during performance of duties.   •	UNDERSHIRTS:  In addition to the plain brown or black T-Shirt, unit-approved squadron T-shirts are authorized (home unit or local unit). They must be black or brown, with the unit emblem not exceeding 3 inches in diameter, placed on the left side of the chest. No other markings are allowed.  Sleep shirts may be worn under the DCU shirt.  Sleep shirts may also be worn with civilian clothes. •	SOCKS:  Black, white or tan socks are authorized to wear.  Change socks when they become wet. Prolonged wear of wet socks can lead to foot injury.  •	WHITE THERMAL UNDERSHIRTS:  These may be worn under the plain brown or black T-Shirt.   •	BLACK NIGHT WATCH CAP:  May be worn during inclement weather.  It may also be worn with civilian clothes. •	BLACK FLEECE LINER:  May NOT be worn as an outer garment.  It must be worn under the appropriate outer garments such as the gortex or field jacket.  It may be worn as an outer garment with civilian clothes. •	GORTEX/FIELD JACKET:   The field/gortex jacket may be worn with flight suits or DCUs.   When worn, the appropriate rank (DCU or BDU) should be displayed.  These items may be worn without rank insignia or name tapes with civilian clothes during inclement weather in tent city. •	BODY PIERCING:  AFI 36-2903 contains extensive direction on body piercing and tattoos.  As a reminder, whether on-duty or off-duty, members are prohibited from attaching, affixing or displaying objects, articles, jewelry or ornamentation to or through the ear, nose, tongue or any exposed body part (includes visible through clothing).  DRIVING AND PARKING:  Tent City must remain a safe place for all occupants at all times.  Parking is only allowed in the designated parking areas on the north and south sides of Tent City outside of the Jersey Barriers.  Only the 407 AEG/CC can approve exceptions to this. •	SPEED LIMIT:  Speed limit throughout Tent City is always 5 mph.  •	DRIVING IN TENT CITY (BETWEEN THE JERSEY BARRIERS):  Driving in and through tent city is prohibited except for emergency vehicles, personnel performing official work tasks inside tent city requiring the use of a vehicle, and the group commander.     •	PICK-UP/DELIVERY:  Commanders and First Sergeants may designate a driver and vehicle to assist with transportation of luggage for arriving and departing personnel.  Luggage should be hand carried between the parking areas or the designated arrival area between the Chapel and the Group monument, to the individual living quarters.  The 407 AEG/CC, CV, or CEM will grant approval on a case-by-case basis for pick-up or delivery of items to individual tents.  •	DRIVING IN LOW VISIBILITY:  In times of low visibility, such as sand storms, a spotter, located in front of the vehicle on the driver’s side, is required to escort the vehicle to and from their destination within Tent City.  •	MANDATORY SEAT BELT USE:  Always wear your seatbelt.  Your life may depend on it. •	RAINY SEASON:   When driving in tent city during periods of rain and wet conditions, remain on the main access routes and do not travel throughout the residential tent areas.  MISCELLANEOUS: •	PHOTOGRAPHY:  Digital photography, combined with the Internet, is one of our greatest OPSEC vulnerabilities today. Please use extremely cautious judgment when sending pictures home-- you never know what is going to wind up on the internet!  With that said, you may take pictures around Tallil Air Base except pictures of fence lines and barriers, SFS checkpoints, any outdoor communications equipment/antenna, and any other sensitive areas that could harm base security and/or national security.

      I've started corespondence with my replacement, just passing along the basics on what to bring/not bring - lessons learned and the like.  This next rotation will be here 120 days vs. our 90 day commitment - all of which pales next to the Army and Marine 1 yr rotations.  I can't imagine an extra month here, much less a year!  This is already feeling like a surreal version of Survivor - we even have a Survivor-esque logo printed up on T-shirts and hats for sale over at the Hot Spot.  Unlike Survivor there are a myriad of rules here, our primary directive comes from General Order #1:  •	No Alcohol or Controlled Substances •	No Pornography or Sexually Explicit Materials •	No Gambling to Include Sports Pools, Raffles, etc. •	No Personally Owned Fire Arms •	Do Not Enter a Mosque or Other Islamic Religious Site •	No Drug Paraphernalia •	No dogs, cats or pets of any kind  In addition to those pretty straightforward rules...we have Tent City rules.  The Tent City rules cover every possible aspect of life and how to conduct yourself within the confines of our living environment.  I'll try to include a link to the Tent City rules in another post...it's hard to quality check any pictures or documents I post here because the Web content filters block access to personal web pages.  My pictures can be accessed by anyone not stuck behind the filter, but I can't see if the images are showing up correctly or not :(

      A very common tool that we have here is a spreadsheet which calculates time spent and time left here in the AOR(Area of Responsibility).  According to my settings, I have:  6.48 Weeks  45.38 Days  1,089.09 Hours  65,345.19 Minutes  3,920,711 Seconds  I like to think on the first figure as number of Combat Bingo nights left :)

      Here it is the "big" day, I'm officially a TSgt...*fanfare* *crowds cheer*...but inevitably I'm here on my day off trying like hell not to go in to work.  I tried to watch a movie this morning, Chicago, while it was entertaining...it just wasn't entertaining enough!  I've been trying to get into a new book I picked up from the library's paperback book exchange...that just isn't happening either.  I'm not a big fan of Peter Straub, but I thought I might be able to get lost in Shadowland - no such luck.  I think I'll take this one back before I waste more time trying to get into it.  I was lucky on my last several book choices - Digital Fortress, The Da Vinci Code, Blackwood Farm, and Robin Cook's Shock(even though it was pretty week for a Robin Cook medical thriller).  I'll just have to spend the time searching through the several hundred paperbacks until I find something of merit...if I don't find anything I "like" to read, I may end up with something non-fiction! *The horror*  "Hi Ho" (quote from Kurt Vonnegut's Slapstick)

      The Canuck left today, he's headed back to Victoria, B.C. - I think..., or is he actually going to Calgary, Alberta to visit with his lovely and   patient  , estranged wife?  I don't know but I wish him all the best on his journey through life, I hope he can grow from his experience here in the desert...only time will tell.  Take care and good luck, eh?

      Today was my promotion ceremony...seeing as that 1 Aug is the date that I put on TSgt, the promotion ceremony historically takes place on the last day of the preceding month, today.  Everything went pretty well except for the fact that I should have drank more water before trying to execute facing movements on the stage in front of hundreds of people - let's just say I didn't fall, but it was close.  I had my friends Tracey and Kelley tack on my stripes, had I been back at Hickam I think I would have chose my wife and kids on one side, and MSgt Erik Harter on the other...even though he could probably put a dent in my arm...not to say my wife couldn't too, for that matter.  I've said it to them already, but I just wanted all those who pass through to know how much I appreciate Tracey and Kelley doing me the honor of participating in my "deployed" promotion ceremony.  Thanks, Ladies!

      Yes! Two more days until I actually make my transformation from Staff Sergeant(SSgt) Michael Durkee to Technical Sergeant(TSgt) Michael Durkee!!  The aspect of progressing in official authority is a thrill, but the realist in me knows that I'm happy because I can more readily support my family of five now.  I won't exactly be getting paid what my civilian computer counterparts are getting paid, but the extra $350 a month should help keep the family fed and recreationed :)...is that a word?  Doesn't much matter, y'all get my point I'm sure.  I've got some other things developing here too, I just can't blog about them yet.  They basically deal with my responsibility to provide computer forensic support regarding some indescretions and violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice by a deployed member of my unit.  I may provide generic details once the case has been handled,  I'm not sure yet.

      I just received a package yesterday from the Kainaliu-Kona Coffee Company in Washington State, it was of course...Kona coffee.  How sweet!  A big mahalo to my Cyber Sister in Mass for hooking me up!  Thanks Cys!!!  Everybody who drinks coffee in the office is just as thrilled as I am, they have no idea what it's like to go through Kona withdrawl though...they will :)

      That's what this deployment is turning into!  Hopefully most of the folks that pass through here have had their basic dose of the William Golding novel in high school and know to which I refer.  Essentially the lawlessness and barbarism is what I'm talking about...then again, there are quite a few people here that could pass for a believable Piggy! And I don't mean the rationale scientific aspect of his character - purely the physical.  I know, I know...what's brought about this rant?  Another one of those messages from management, this one came with pictures...I'll save you the horror of seeing those - I'm still shaking my head - eeeyyeeww.  Here is the jist(no pun intended, especially since I used a "t" to end that word rather than an "m")of the email we received:  First the message from "the top", our Group Commander:  I know we are all focused on accomplishing the mission and it is unfortunate that I even need to address this issue.  However, it has come to my attention that some personnel within our tent city are having a problem conforming to what I consider basic common courtesy regarding the usage of our latrine facilities.  While we are here we are a part of a deployed team that depends on each other to get the job done.  Part of being a successful team is respecting each other and working together.  Therefore I must insist on everyone’s cooperation in ensuring when we use the latrines we leave them in the same condition we found them.  For those of you who have been unable to do this I ask that you take responsibility for your actions and stop conducting yourself in this unprofessional manner.    Now the unadulterated version from the bottom - one of the people in charge of clean up sent this exact report to the masses:  Chief/Shirt, I'm not one to complain but what my people have seen and had to deal with go far beyond complaining; if it continues then I'll instruct them not to clean those particular areas.  There's a difference between being inconsiderate and dirty to being down right unsat.  We're all adults here and this behavior is unacceptable period.  I would suggest that the group get involved and express that the follow behavior will not be acceptable.  I've highlighted the comments that need to be addressed and left out the complaining.  Note the attached pictures.   Tuesday:  ….some water around floor, feces smeared tissues around toilets and on toilets - not the ones that were clogged, although they had it too.  Friday: ….Two overflowing with urine and feces, the same thing on the floor.  Last four stalls to the right had an inch of water with the fore mentioned….Spent 1 1/2 hours mopping floors, getting feces off the floor, disinfecting toilets and cleaning sink.    Saturday:...opened a closed stall and found the following: See attached photos.  To get the right perspective please magnify X10 and make believe your using a stick or hands to clean out.         Constant:  Last stall to the right and the left usually have more tissues laying around than the rest.  Have found tissues that were used to masturbate tossed on and around toilets.  People are sick, normally on Temporary Duty (TDY) to places where you can drink we deal with goofy stuff like that - but everyone here is sober as can be!  That's just downright scary!

      36 days to go, I'm really starting to get burned out.  Today I've got to say goodbye to one of the best people I've met in a long time, I'm not going to get all teary-eyed but I will definitely miss his friendship.  No, it's not the Canuck!  He and I never really recovered from the "Alienation" episode, I'm sorry to say.  I held the same opinion as a few of his family members and I don't think he appreciated my honesty...anyway he's got his own demons to work out and a little more growing up to do, just as we all do, I'm not trying to be mean...that's just the honest, bitter truth.  Anyway, the person departing is Shawn from Knoxville.  He's a member of the Tennessee Air National Guard, his unit rotated him in for 30 days now it's his time to go back home.  I won't lie, I wish I was headed out on that #$#(* plane too...    Aloha, Shawn.  Best wishes for a safe flight back to the wife and kids!

      Just came acrossed a quirky site, Blogshares.  You can see my link to the left, I guess the gist of Blogshares is to buy and sell blogs as if they were actual companies on the market.  It's one of those days where I'm deskbound anyway...I thought I would give it a run through :)

      Received my care package from home, it had a bunch of goodies in it!  Finally got my Crest WhiteStrips, sleeping pills, PT outfit, and a bunch of other nice stuff.  I even got a little keyboard, PlayDough, and a really cool homemade bracelet :)  That really picked up my day...well everything except for the forwarded hate mail from my mother.  Yep, hate mail.  The only reason I put myself through the hell of still accepting letters from her is because she's my mother after all...I don't respond to her at all - I prefer to think of the "if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all" rule.  I don't want to ever send someone a quarter of the vile crap she dishes out, even if it's simply "returning the favor".  She is so concerned about what I tell my children and the world about her, she would actually be surprised to know how much I   don't   talk about her and how she   isn't   the core of my daily life.  But anyway, I've already given too much attention to that unfortunate topic.  I really did like the package though, snail mail call is definitely better when receiving packages and letters.  Most of my correspondence is via email and although it's almost instantaneous...you don't quite get the same satisfaction out of opening an email like you do a big old package :)

      This damn Websense firewall/Internet browser filter is really becoming a pain in the posterior!  I used to be able to have a little more fun with the blog by posting the occasional picture or two...now I may still be able to do it but as I've mentioned before...I can't see the finished result :(  Maybe I'll figure out how to use my Buzznet photoblog correctly so that I can upload the pictures there and link to them here...we'll see.  If y'all want to see the random pictures I've been uploading over there you can go to  urlLink http://madurkee.buzznet.com .

      While doing my daily check of  urlLink Snopes , I came acrossed this article on the old  urlLink "sugar in the gas tank"  stunt.  I've only had that happen to me once, thankfully!  I remember it like it was yesterday...some #$*(#$ was ticked off because I made him pay for or at least replace a fan that he busted while he had borrowed it from the wife and I. But according to the Snopes article...it's not exactly the worst thing that could happen to your vehicle.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Just received a call from my friend, Shawn, he's back at home in Knoxville, TN.  He's glad to be home, I'm sure looking forward to getting back to Honolulu myself.  He's only been away 30 days and his wife keeps asking him "what's wrong" - he just wants to chill a little bit without having to run here and there...I can relate to that, it will be a challenge transitioning back into my family groove too.  They've pressed on without me for the length of this deployment, I'll have to find my way back in somehow...maybe better than before :) *Hi Ho*

      My tail is seriously dragging today - the last three nights I wasn't able to do my "take a sleeping pill at 1800hrs and be asleep by 1900hrs" routine.  Our tent had to pull Cadillac Sponsorship duty...in non-Air Force speak - we had to clean the latrine and shower trailers.  We all dutifully(I could of said doody-fully) met outside our tent at 2100hrs and the five inhabitants of tent F-9 trudged on with our task.  It really wasn't too bad, but then again I was only cleaning the sinks, countertops, and mirrors...I wasn't on flusher/plunger/scrubber duty(doody?).  We finished up by 2130hrs, so all in all it wasn't so bad - we shouldn't have to do it again for the rest of this deployment.  Anyway, I'm definitely looking forward to hitting the bed early tonight.  That is after I watch the Van Helsing DVD I managed to acquire! YES!  If y'all have been following the blog from the beginning and saw my post about seeing Troy but not being able to see Van Helsing you would know how much I wanted to see this movie.  It has to be better than Hellboy...that was a stinker for sure.

      I thought that y'all would enjoy a list of the "Desert Definitions" that are in circulation here at Tallil.  Some are a little too honest, but that doesn't mean they're not necessarily valid definitions. They are as follows:    Cadillac - A portable latrine with running water and flushing toilets - all the bells and whistles.  Chow - Food-like substance, sometimes lukewarm, fills the stomach void.  Desert Eagles - The flies that make up over 99% of the majestic wildlife.  Desert Goggles - Similar to Beer Goggles, this condition turns raunchy "Desert Queens" into super models after months of female deprivation.  Desert Muscles - A slight increase in muscle tone and/or mass brought on by hours of hard work in the gym and chugging expensive, chalky dietary supplements.  This instantly turns into Beer Gut upon entering the aircraft for the trip home.  Drain Babies - Fluid resulting from autoerotic stimulation in the "Shower" or "Wack Shack".  Entourage - Two or more males suffering from " Desert Goggles " who follow a particular  " Desert Queen ". They are all secretly jealous of one another, but openly cock-block lone males trying to move in on their "Queen".  GPS - Golden Pu**y Syndrome; caused by males suffering from "Desert Goggles" and a lack of competition, this causes "Desert Queens" to think of themselves as Goddesses and be generally bitchy.  The only known cure is a fast flight to the States for a reality check.  Hard Core XXX Porn - Maxxim, Stuff, FHM, Muscle Mags, Swimsuit Editions, and anything else that shows skin above the ankle or below the neck.  Holiday - A day like any other, except the "Chow" is slightly more Food-like and a "Party" is organized.  NA Beer - A fallacy, never has the word beer been applied to a more deplorable concoction.  Party - A small, base organized gathering with coolers full of water, stale cookies, and loud Rap. The theory being that if you cannot hear the guy next to you complaining then we must all be having fun and not realize there is a distinct lack of adult beverages.  Radio - One "Pop" song every thirty minutes of Armed Forces Network public service announcements and commercials explaining why they don't air commercials.  Sand Script - Writing your name in the sand ( like snow).  Shower - "Drain Babies" shooting range (flip-flops strongly recommended).  Six Pack - Four Door Pick-up truck.  Soft Porn - Pictures of women's ankles and wrists.  Spank Tank - See "Wack Shack"  "Take the Caddy for a Spin" - Shitting  VD - Another condition often suffered by "Desert Queens". One of a few conditions that are not cured by "Vitamin M".  Vitamin M - 800mg Motrin Horse Pills; believed by Air Force medical professionals to cure everything from hysterical pregnancies to decapitations, it is an essential part of every airman's diet.  If you find yourself the unfortunate enough to suffer an ailment that "Vitamin M " won't cure, doctors recommend a two step program: 1) Go to the Chapel, 2) Make peace with your God.  Wack Shack - A fortress of solitude made by draping blankets and towels around the bottom bunk.  Work - A place you go at a pre-arranged time, seven days a week, for twelve hours at a time to burn CDs and send e-mail; Solitaire and BeJeweled are optional.

      I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs, playing a couple  urlLink http://www.mousebreaker.com  games waiting on the Communications Squadron to re-diagnose a problem with accessing some of our more critical af.mil sites.  I say re-diagnose, because I already told the helpdesk technician what the problem is   and   what needed to be done to fix it!  There you go, just like doctors make terrible patients...techies make terrible helpdesk customers.  I'm not so bad, really...I have some empathy for what the helpdesk deals with -I just can't stand being "handled" or "flowcharted"! grrrrrrrrrr.

      I suppose I could touch on the computer forensics work I did a week or two ago, not too much detail but just a rundown of the circumstances.  Do y'all remember reading through that loooooonnnnnggggg post with all the rules we are subject to while living in Tent City, and being deployed here in general?  What?  You didn't read them all?  Guess what...neither did 40% of the residents here, but as they say, ignorance is not a defense.  One of those rules references the ban on sex, whether married or single and Public Displays of Affection(PDA) as well.  Unfortunately, where there's an urge there's a way - I don't care one way or another "who's doing who", just as long as I'm not a witness to it.  Call it what you will, "Ratting someone out", "Stool Pigeon", whatever...it's my responsibility as an NCO to comply with orders and ensure that my peers and subordinates do the same.  If there's a problem with that...reference the Air Force's Core Values, which are listed in the heading of this blog for anyone who wasn't aware of that :)  Anyway, to make a short story long.  There was an Airman carrying on with one of the Italian Coalition members - this is definitely not a rare occurrence, there are plenty of American women being wooed by the Italian men...but this particular Airman was/is married.  Again, I didn't see it and she's not my personal concern - that was until she requested I move some pictures from one computer to another for her.  In the performance of my official duty as a Workgroup/LAN Administrator I saw her rather benign digital pictures...unfortunately although not explicit, these pictures documented her inappropriate actions/behavior.  My responsibility was to ensure my boss was aware of what I had seen, I told him...he said he would discuss it with her, end of story.  Wrong.  A couple days later I was asked to retrieve the pictures as official evidence in an investigation - no surprise, the pictures were deleted.  Fine, no problem...I did some wildcard searches - no pictures came back, but an entire directory full of text files did.  Upon further investigation, these text files were actual email messages saved to be used with Italian-English translation software.  I turned over all the text messages to the investigator and provided an official statement that I gathered the information directly from the hard drive, not the actual email account.  Although it's a government computer, it's still illegal for Workgroup/LAN Administrators to directly access a user's email account.  Needless to say, this young lady is in a shitstorm.  Funniest thing about it is she's slinging accusations around as if "someone is out to get her" and "you people did this to me".  Who did what to whom?  You screwed up, take some personal accountability and move on.  It's far from over, but for the most part my obligations and responsibilities have all been met - no regrets here.  It's unfortunate, but that's life.

      I couldn't access the blog the last couple days to give any sort of an update on what's happening, my apologies, I'm quite safe regardless of the latest action in Nasiriyah.  The reason I couldn't update anything was due to a "MINIMIZE" order from the Communications Squadron.  Here's a copy of the order:     TALLIL AB ADVISORY     MINIMIZE IN EFFECT     Situation Description: In an effort to clear information systems of traffic that does not have the urgency to require electrical transmissions a minimize has been put in effect until further notice.    Services Affected: DSN and Internet Access    Remarks: ECS will monitor all DSN Traffic to ensure that traffic is strictly limited to information that is for valid official business calls only. Access to DSN for non-official calls, to include morale calls, and internet access is limited. Please direct any other comments or questions to the Help Desk/ CFP at XXX-XXXX or XXX-XXXX     This was obviously important for reasons I can't discuss, remember after all, if you want information that the civilian populus really shouldn't know...visit CNN :P
