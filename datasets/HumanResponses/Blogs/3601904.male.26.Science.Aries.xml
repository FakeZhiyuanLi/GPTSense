      Here's the adventure for the day.  Read this Email that arrived in my mailbox:  June 28, 2004 CANCELLATION NOTICE   As of this date, we have not reached a resolution regarding the transaction to ALLSTATE on 04/26/2004 for the amount of $139.09. As explained in previous correspondence, your payment service account has now been canceled and the amount you owe has been forwarded to an outside law firm that will handle the collections process for this debt. Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, we are required to inform you that this message is an attempt to collect on a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose. Please do not reply to this message. The information in this e-mail message is also being sent to you by U.S. mail.   Here's the kicker: I neither done business with that bank  nor  Allstate since moving to San Diego.  In fact, the car that had been insured under this policy has not even mine anymore!  I sold it six months or more ago!  So, while I get to clean up this mess, I also have the privelege of using cell phone minutes from my new month which, as fortune would have it, started yesterday...  ...Damn the man.

      We took a trip to Lake Mead, where we camped, saw Hoover Dam, and eventually made our way to Vegas (In the summer, it's almost unavoidable to hit Vegas from that area.  The temperature outside reached 112 degrees in the day, and you can only swim for so long).  I found the Hoover Dam to be the highlight of my trip, with the magnitude of the project leaving me astounded.  I know that I face the ire of some of my friends, who are undoubetdly more knowledgable in the impact that erection of this project has on local ecosystems, but I'm moved, regardless.  The trip to Vegas was fun, as well.  I was able to come out a few bucks ahead, and I was able to sit at a poker table; an opportunity that has been lost to me during the last months, due to an excessively busy schedule.  Here are some pictures...

      I'll go in chronological order in catching you up, so that I can minimize the confusion of the tome that I'm bound to write (It seems that I have a tough time being brief when it comes to writing.    This brings me back to 1998.  I finished out that year with academic success, and a great impression of Indiana, especially the people.  I took this memory with me to Salt Lake City, where I returned to finish some pre-med requirements.  It's the quality of the people in Indiana that eventually brought me back to the state.  In SLC, as I said, I took some of the required courses for application to medical school.  I had been pretty homesick prior to my return, and I was pleased to be met by family and friends with open arms.  I considered staying, but in the end, I found the culture of Utah to be stifling, and I was soon reminded of the factors that convinced me to depart the state originally.  I missed the laid-back personalities of the people that I spent time with at Purdue, and so much of the excitement I felt at the different events at that school drew me back to the midwest.  Before I left, I reconnected with a friend that I had known from High School, Heather.  She had kept in touch during the last few years by sending an annual Christmas card, and I hadn't seen her in quite sometime.  I went to a track meet where she was competing in my hometown, and we started spending time together after that point.  By the time I returned to Indiana, we were a couple, and after she graduated she moved out to W. Lafayette.  The next couple of years we spent in a zen-like balance of blissful peace and abject poverty.  There were more days than I care to count where we wondered how to afford our next meal, and Heather worked three jobs at one point.  One of the jobs, opening and proscessing paper applications for an insurance company, was so distasteful to Heather that she would literally be reduced to tears at least once weekly before she would leave for the office.  We had bed, no couch, and really no furniture to speak of, other than a nightstand and a folding chair for over a year.  On the other hand, I remember few things that felt so luxurious as the first salads that we were able to eat at home when our income had improved to the point that we could afford to risk purchasing food items that might spoil if not eaten promptly.  We ate our dinner sitting on the living room floor, facing each other across a $2.99 game of backgammon that we had purchased upon arrival.     The next couple of years passed with many of the activities that make college memorable to many becoming part of my experiences as well.  The sporting events, trips to Chicago, and the Neon Cactus provided punctuation between the long periods of study.  I read widely, as I found my major to be neither challenging nor satisfying.  I was able to become conversant in French, to learn a few words in Russian, to get a basic education in economics, politics, and history, as well as to solidify the idea in my mind that an advanced degree was a must.    With graduation looming, a semester or so away, Heather and I were married.  We had been living together for over a year, but prior to this time, it seemed that being officially married would not provide us with anyadditional benefits, as neither of us had a salary or benefits that could be shared any more effectively than it was already, and we would be the only people among our acquaintances who would not be single, a   de facto   badge of social alienation, as people would question what activities would be appropriate for inviting a couple along.  Add this to my already pensive and sometimes taciturn nature, and we were looking at a fast road to isolation.  (I agree, this is overstated, but it was running on, and I wanted to color it up a bit.)  On New Year's Eve, 2002, we held an intimate ceremony in Logan Canyon, at a lodge being held open for the occassion.  We decided to invite only immediate family members, and to start the celebration with a dinner on the Eve, and have the ceremony run over the midnight hour.  We figured that with an anniversary on that date, a celebration would always be handy, and we could pretend that others were celebrating in our honor.  Heather looked fantastic in her dinner dress, and the meal was delicious.  There were many "hitches" that made the night memorable, including even, the wedding ring being lost in a snowbank irrecoverably hours before the ceremony.  Heather was the very image of cool-headed grace under fire, though, and kept the event from being ruined, though I'm sure she must've been panicked inside.  She simply borrowed my mother's wedding ring for the ceremony, and eventually we found the ring (the next day, under a bush).  The next months passed quickly, and graduation came at last.  I was commissioned on the day before graduation as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps.  It was a formal ceremony as well, a bit stiff for me, but it felt wonderful to be earning an income after struggling through school.  Another pleasant surprise was the lack of similarity between working for the Navy and being in training.  Suddenly, there was an actual job to be done, and as long as that goal was met, the picky details were often overlooked.  I enjoyed the last few weeks there, then I was sent to San Diego.  Heather and I packed up a Ryder truck, put Jill, our Nissan Maxima, on a tow dolly, and drove across the country with all of our scant belongings in tow.  Now we're in San Diego, and it couldn't be a more ideal place, in my opinion.  The temperate weather ensures a comfortable day regardless of the time of year, and the availability of outdoor activities from skiing to surfing, cultural events like museums and theater (not to mention a neighboring country miles away), and a solid university system make this an ideal place for me.  Now, we're basically to the present.  It's amazing the amount of time that work and school can take up.  Fortunately, with Heather playing volleyball regularly at the beach, we've made a fairly large circle of friends, and from day to day, it's a pleasant scene in which to exist.  I'll post this story for a few days, or as long as a couple of weeks, but I'm unsure whether I'll leave it up permanently.  I wanted to put it up for friends who I reached recently, that have been "out of the loop" for awhile to catch up.  ---

      I'm trying to think of things to talk about that would be worth reading to others; thoughts that would somehow seem pertinent.  Unfortunately, I am muddling my way along, and not coming up with much of anything.  Any suggestions?  Any burning questions?  I spent the day at the beach yesterday, watching friends beach volleyball.  I'm the only one of my circle of friends who doesn't play.  By now, it's almost become a badge of honor for me.  Even if I had a strong interest in learning the game (which I really don't), I would have to back down from my imaginary pedestal to do, and I wonder if I'd be up to the task.  As it is, I am an enthusiastic, or at least comfortable, spectator.  What do people talk about?  I'm finding volleyball a dead-end topic for me tonight.  I struggle with small-talk.  This is why I always had a tough time meeting new people when I'd go out.  It would take a huge effort to ramp up to asking a few questions about whatever I thought the other person would want to talk about (usually something that didn't interest me), then I'd fizzle out before the conversation got rolling.  For instance, I'd start with, "So....did you see the...game this week?"  Meanwhile, I've no idea what sport I'm referring to, in fact, I would be unsure of what season it was.  I was simply leaving it open.  A two-word answer would suffice to shut me up, usually.    I was more honest about it as a child.  I didn't yet realize that my interests tended to run counter to those of my same age group (or as I find, a generation older, as well).  My mother still loves to tell the story of me at seven years of age asking a woman I met, "So...have you read any good books lately?"  If she had, I was probably too young to understand the genre, but even more likely, she hadn't picked up a book since donning cap and gown at the end of high school.  Maybe I'm wrong overall, and just being too critical of others, assuming that they wouldn't understand.    Now the difficulty with starting this post is coming out more clearly.  Unfortunately, I don't have any topics.  Maybe a picture.  Also, I'll add a link to a blog that I enjoy, from a lady living in Vancouver.    Okay, strike that reference to a link.  I am currently a hopelessly incompetent webmaster, but I'm working on it.  If you're interested in looking, the site is: www.acamgirl.com  I find her humor infective, and I love her sarcasm.  If you're looking for porn, you'll have to keep looking elsewhere, because she states clearly that she's not into exhibitionism, etc.  She does have links to that material, though.  She says that she gets 7,000-11,000 unique hits daily.  I wonder if that figure still holds, and how she ever generated that kind of traffic.  Impressive...

      I just returned from a concert, the first I've attended in awhile.  The   Yeah Yeah Yeah's    were in town.  What a hell of a show!   urlLink    I didn't know what to expect when I first browsed their website.  They seemed a little hardcore compared to the only song that I'd heard before.  But I'm telling you,   see these guys in concert  !  They claim to have a love affair with San Diego, and after tonight, the feeling is mutual.  It made the evening of swatting back belligerent teens bent on elbowing their way closer to the stage worth the effort.    These guys weren't the only pleasant band of the night.  Another group, Stella Star was a pleasant surprise.  The drummer was hilarious, starting the show fully clothed, and sporting a pair of rhinestone sunglasses, but before three songs had been completed, he shed his shirt to reveal some sort of nipple decoration made of electrical tape.  Here's a story on them from a Long Beach student newspaper.   urlLink    Enough for the night.  I'm exhausted from the festivities, and not up to par for writing much more.  I'm in the middle of a three-day minivacation that I took with my wife after finishing a rough semester.  More on that later.  I know that I promised an introduction, but most people who will read this early on know who I am already, and I found the profile listing on the blogger site.    I really like the ease with which I can post on this site, but I would like to personalize it more, and to maybe alter the formatting of the page.  If anyone has suggestions on how to do this, shoot me an Email.  Here's a blurred shot from on the way out of the concert at SOMA.  If this isn't proof enough that I'm ready to hit the sack...

      I'm writing this page in response to a need that I've found increasingly strong in myself during the last year.  I found that my mind would become cluttered with various thoughts, reminiscences, and concerns, while I also tried to work through a number of practical matters at the same time.  During that time, I decided to keep a journal, to do one of two things: 1) Move my trivial thoughts into a concrete setting so that I could focus on more practical matters, or 2) Write down something profound and practical, so that I would be free to dwell on pleasant thoughts and imaginings.  As it turns out, neither of these matters have been settled, but I have found an interest in writing that has grown stronger as I wrote more. Somehow, it's comforting to see the chaos of impulses, dreams, and desires that swirls inside of me laid into some order that I can follow.   I will return soon with an introduction, and more pictures.  Here is the first one.  Enjoy...
