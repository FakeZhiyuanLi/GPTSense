       morning    breakfast @ gardens market:    wat: pig's organs soup...Nice!...jerome had to Q for quite a while b4 his turn. he's really sweet & thoughtful when he decided to get me tou hua 1st b4 he Q when he saw the long Q & upon hearing tat i wanted to eat tou hua.  special guest appearance: auntie charlis from APS! can't believed she told me she lived in chua chu kang & came all the way here to have breakfast with a friend & her dad. such kind soul.     night    had an argument with bee:    wat happpen: drove him to AMK central when i woke up after my evening nap. wanted to be nice to send him there even though i hate driving. he understood & appreciated tat & persuaded me to just walk him to the bus stop. still i insisted to drive him there. he thought i wanted more time with him. wld love to but knew he has a pointed butt so just want to send him there & get a drink & go home. i just want to laze at home. guess i shd have communicate tat to him instead of letting him to think he needs to accompany me. on the way i was pretty snapping abt ppl jaywalking & finding a carpark space. guess frustration built up in us. he left his bag in the car thinking we wld be going home together. to his dismay, i just 1 2 get the MOS milk tea & go home. ended up arguing over MOS burger ice milk tea - he insisted i shd not get it whereas i really need a drink & an excuse of using the car after i complaint to my mum abt waking me up.   story ending: went home w/o the drink feeling heated, got an SMS on the way home saying he understood my good intention. all was well again.   to learn: guess it's learning to communicate more effectively again & me learning to control my 'snappy-ness' when driving. kind of stupid to argue over these little things. i guess it's not the drink it's my attitude & poor communication.   to note: more to learn. =)

      MA paper sucks. can't do man...attempt less than 2.5 qns out of 4. no idea if my answers make any sense...no luck.  MSM paper was okie. did 2.5qn out of 4. shd be able to pass.  MM paper was okie but i cock up...did 3qns out of 5...maybe can scrape thru' if lucky. forget how to do part (a) of a qn so can't do the WHOLE qn...20marks gone. rather didn't practice enough to make sure it drills in...too late.  Macro paper was okie but complete 2.5 qns out of 4. maybe can pass...maybe  maybe can grad...maybe =(
