         Work last night was crazy! It was only my second night so I still don't have everything down perfect yet which sucked because we were packed the whole night! The lobby was full of people waiting! I didn't get my tips because April hadn't finished yet when I left but I'm pretty sure its going to be at least twenty dollars in tips. Tonight I'm working again but Amanda isn't going to be there, just Melissa and April, so I hope I don't have too much trouble without her. She's been a real help with trying to figure out how to do everything. But I think she is kind of putting some of her work on me. Oh man I just got off the phone with Amanda and she wants me to work tomorrow night for her as well as Saturday and Sunday too. Geeze, I was only going to work two days this week but now I'm working six! I better make some pretty good money!          Well I found the stallion I definitely want to breed Mandy too, Crescent Chex. We checked into him a couple years ago and we were really thinking about breeding to him but we never did, probably because of money but I don't remember. But now he has become a really accomplished stallion! He's done great in reining and working cow horse. I think that's awesome because it would be different than the typical show horse these days. The foal would definitely be stocky with a big hip and powerful hind quarters! Maybe even be a good reiner. That would be awesome. I don't know if my mom would go for that though because the stud fee is one-thousand dollars...But I'm thinking if I put like three-fourths of my pay check and around half my tips in a savings account than I can help pay the difference of about four-hundred dollars. He's so built and perfect color. My absolute dream horse. I know a foal between him and Mandy would be the ultimate horse for sure.          Well I guess I will have more to talk about tonight after work.

        Well today was day three of "Restriction" for me and Ashley. It was alot better than day one and two though. Today we were allowed to come out of our room, watch t.v. and go on the computer. I don't know why mom and Lance still say we are on Restriction if thats the case, I think they just like using that word because it makes it seem like they are in power. They are on such a power trip. Mom says we are still going to be on Restriction for a few more days...that is so retarded! Who cares?!           I got my clothes from Urban Outfitters today. I really like them. I didn't really like any of them at first but now I really do. No one else at school will have clothes like mine so thats awesome. I really want to start wearing clothes that no one else has so I'm just like everyone else.           I can't wait until we go to Cailfornia. It is going to be alot of fun hanging out with Becky and Mike and little Christian. I just hope we get to go out and do stuff in the city and stuff and aren't just sitting at their house the whole time. Supposibly we were going to go the San Fransciso Fair while we were there but then Ashley and I didn't clean the living so that would be fun that we didn't deserve.
