      ahhhhhh, the weather today was so.... FALL... and fall makes me think of halloween.. and boy, oh boy, that just makes me giddy.  i LOVE the fall.  i love the smells... i love the way the sky looks all cloudy and grey.. and the cool air that's just cold enought to put a chill down your spine.  and somehow all the smells mix up into one.. from fireplaces to leaves falling.. to little ghosts and goblins ringing the doorbell, looking for candy... LOVE it.    love it.  love IT.  ahem.    sorry, i guess i'm getting a little carried away.  in other news, i saw napoleon dynamite tonight.  it was sweet (said in napoleon's voice, which i can't "do" at all but that won't keep me from trying and driving everyone nuts.)  i'd like to see it again.  and i'd like to get the dvd when it comes out so i can see all the silly extras.    speaking of extras, my show is coming on in 11 minutes.  yesterday, when i was at safeway buying 10 yogurts for $4.00, a woman at the checkout line jogged over to my lane and shouted in a really excited voice like she was on the price is right or something, "i'm rooting for the longshots!!!"  i fumbled and almost dropped my wallet and looked up to this little lady with curly hair, looking at me like i was a celebrity.  it was so weird.  i just said, "oh, thank you!"  and she asked if i could tell her what happens.  i couldn't, of course, but she seemed to like me anyway.  then, the same day, some friends and i were all down at the local bar and two guys walked up to our table and said, "we've seen you on tv."  it was so strange.  i'm always somewhere between embarrassed and scared and i NEVER have a good response.    any help out there?

      I've been thinking a lot today about the past… about how romantic the beginning was… and how romantic my life is now, although I don’t admit it very often.  Abstract life is much better than life with details and I prove that daily by only writing from an aerial view.  Someone once said “life is in the details” but I disagree.  I find it looks much better from 30,000 feet.    It’s cloudy and rainy out today.  My favorite weather.. weather to think by.  I’m thinking about jumping ship once again… about re-routing my life.  Not necessarily by moving or uprooting myself but by changing directions.. doing something I wouldn’t expect of myself.  I’m getting bored and boredom breeds unhappiness.  I want to feel carefree and easy and I think I do that best with an agenda, if that makes any sense at all.    I’m a planner and I need a plan.

      i've been sitting here for a couple of minutes looking out the window, trying to think of some part of my day that's been interesting enough to blog about but i'm coming up empty.  it's raining out and i've been staring at raindrops falling into a pot outside the window for the past two minutes straight.  if that's the best i've got, this is going nowhere fast...  this week has actually been flying by.  my birthday was on monday and it was a good one... other than the fact that my best friend forgot about it.  the up side of it, though, is that now she feels really bad and probably also feels like she owes me BIG time.  i'll be able to torture her with this and hold it over her head for the rest of our lives.... aw, what are best friends for?  coming up next week is the big 80's prom night party.  topping the last party, the 70's roller skating rink party, is going to be tough to do but i'm up for the challenge.  i've already got my outfit planned out.. right down to the banana clip and big bangs.  all i have to do is go down to goodwill and the other local thrift shops and find the perfect turquoise-sequined-poofy-sleeved prom dress to make the vision complete.  ahhhh, the 80's....
