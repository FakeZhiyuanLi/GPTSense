       There's this guy I work with that I sometimes just can't figure out. The lunchtime roundtable includes group conversation about sci-fi novels, new movies, world travel, and election politics. And through such fascinating dialogue, I have managed to get to know some people I work with quite well, but this kid still perplexes me. We don't really agree on anything, but just like at a family reunion, since we're close in age I guess we have to be friends.    Anyway, the one thing we do have in common is taste in music (must be that age thing), so whenever he finds something that I might like, he loans me a copy. Well,  gives  me a copy I suppose--I don't know that I've ever returned anything to him. But his latest cd was a mix he made for himself, and he gave me a copy without giving me the track list. He said I should recognize most of the tracks, but if I don't--well, it's a damn shame that I've been missing out on this stuff, and now's the time to get educated.   So I'm a bit embarrased, cause I do recognize some of it--I know I've heard this stuff before, but I don't know who the groups are, what albums the tracks come from.. So I'll try to post some of what I hear, you can help me figure out the tracks so I don't feel like such a dumbass in front of my new friend... --- Woops, batteries are dead on the desktop cd-man. Have to wait til Monday..

       There's a Delerium mix that I've been listening to in the last 16 hours--the long techno mix of the single  Silence , featuring Sarah McLachlan.  There's a time where all you hear is "I am free...." And I keep singing that to myself.  Skip back a day, read the post below to see where I was yesterday. Not there anymore. Some information about  him  and his motives, that I wasn't really privy to before has come to light. That's right ladies, sometimes you just have to let that conniving little bitch inside come up for some air and wreak a little havoc in the world. She's inside all of us, and she's there for times like these when we need her.   Anyway, without going into the nasty details, I am finally free. I understand now and I'm so happy to be free. I can't say that I've ever really experienced that cliched word "closure" until now.  Sigh, it's a beautiful day people.

        And so it is... just like you said it would be Life goes easy on me...most of the time And so it is The shorter story No love, no glory No hero in her sky  And so it is... just like you said it should be We'll both forget the breeze... most of the time And so it is The colder water The blower's daughter The pupil in denial  I can't take my eyes off of you.........  Did I say that I loathe you? Did I say that I want to leave it all behind?  I can't take my mind off of you......... 'Til I find somebody new   You might recognize that as a  urlLink Damien Rice  song, The Blower's Daughter. I'm not sure where Rice was when he wrote it, but part of the song keeps repeating in my mind, "And so it is..."  I came across a posting on  urlLink craigslist  today from someone I know, who is right now trying to replace me in our old apartment. Those who are close to me have graciously listened to me over and over again repeat my questions, my fears and my doubts, and have so wonderfully helped me in drying those nasty tears. And yet sometimes, when you think you're finally beginning to get past something--when you start believing what your friends are telling you, when you realize that you have started breathing again--there's something there to serve as the tiniest reminder of the reality of the situation. He's moving on without me, and I'm still stuck here wanting to understand why.   It's like being close to that edge, that one that I've slowly been backing away from, and seeing it there in black and white is another nudge that is just big enough to send me back over. Silly really to look at it that way, but it's just the way I think sometimes. But I am still breathing, and I'll eventually get far enough away from that edge, where none of this will matter anymore. And I'll laugh at myself for thinking and behaving this way.  Anyway, if you need a cool spot to live in Uptown Minneapolis, I suggest you check it out. He is a great guy, and his dog is really cute.

       No, I'm not referring that Oprah channel show or whatever that is where they trap all those women in a house for I don't know what reason. I simply killed this blog a couple of days ago, but thought I'd bring it back up with a new start.   A New Start...  Seems to be the theme these days. In a selfish way, I've been pitying myself for the new start I'm making in my life, a new start that I didn't necessarily want to happen, one that I don't particularly want to deal with. But I was talking to a woman the other day about how she feels like everyone around her is making new starts all the time, in many different senses of the word, and dealing with theses various scenarios in similar ways.. I realized that New Starts are everywhere these days..  a friend who has moved away.. a friend who is getting ready to start fresh in a new city.. a friend who just returned home.. a friend who has just come out of a relationship with a new perspective on himself.. a friend who has began a new experience with the man she'll one day marry, while simultaneously preparing for the loss of her father and the changing family landscape that will require a sort of new start to keep moving.. family who have made a new start somewhere else, and are building on it each day..  It's just interesting to stop and realize that yeah--that's life, that's how we learn, that's how we change, that's how we grow.. A series of new starts have brought us each to where we are, and undoubtedly, there are many more in store..
