      In the beginning, what  great way to start a book! I could go back to the time where there was total void; but maybe it would be better to start at, let there be light... For me the light didn't come on until I was in my thirty's, mid thirty's. I packed a few clothes and photo albums and the kids and I left California for a new life. Mom and Dad had moved to Arkansas a few months earlier so I knew, at least, I had a place to go. The kids and I showed up at Mom and Dads house one week before the 4th of July in 1999 with a $500.00 car and the clothes on our backs. Mom, being the control freak she is, took it upon herself to give me her car and purchase another for herself( of course I had to pay for it). Then as if that wasn't enouth she also purchased a $60,000.00 double wide mobile home and parked it 40 feet from her house and told me that it was my house. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate all of her help, but it would be nice if she would allow me to have a little input as to what I drive and where I live. Well, as usual I just made the best of it . (living in a 40 acre park like setting right on a river in a 3 bdr 2 bth 1500 sq ft home paying only $400.00 a month including phone, satellite TV and utilities). At this point things seemed pretty good, but don't forget MOM is a CONTROLL FREK! I met this guy,( looser with no job living with some mutual friends) sure he was a little younger than me, ( 9 years younger) but I loved him. Well I brought him home for a weekend to spend some time with me and the kids. The following Monday evening when I came home from work and found a note lying on my bed from MOM!!!( Insert heart pounding music) Basically it said that I was not allowed to have men at my house over night; remember I am in my thirty's, but I didn't want to give up a good thing ( see above discreption of where I live) so eventually that relationship died out. Now we are closer to current day activity. In February of 2004 my Dad left. ( imagine that) It was kinda weird the way he left. I came home from work Firday evening about 6:00pm maybe 6:30pm, changed clothes and headed to Mom and Dads to get my mail and play a quick game of Backgammon with Dad. Mom was cooking dinner, I asker her where Dad was and she said "out for a walk" ( nothing unusual). After an hour or so it statred to get dark and Dad had not reutrned. ( Dad is 61 has a bad heart and bad knees) I went out with a flash light and looked up and down the river and yelled out a few times. By 9pm I was back in the house and ready to call the police, but Mom didn't seem as concerned. She showed me that there were papers on the desk in her room that were previously in the safe deposit box, and next to them was the check book and several of Dads credit cards. Instinctively, I went to Dads medicine cabinet and it was empty. Ther first thing out of my mount was " Dad ran away from home". As time passed we noticed that he took blankets, we found a receipt for another camper truck and the generator was gone. Mom filed a missing persons report and filed for devorice. Do to a lot of legal issues, we are getting screwed ! The Judge ordered Mom to sell the house, then the proceeds will go to a law firm, and the law firm will pay off all the marital debt., When all is said and done Mom will be lucky to break even, But as ususal she doesn't see that. (Mom, by the way, tends to live in a cotton candy world where Dad took care of the cars, property, payed the bills and so on ). So in a nutshell that is where we are as of today....
